HEADLINE: In Environmental Push, Looking to Add Diversity

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
When Jerome C. Ringo joined the board of the National Wildlife Federation in 1995, he was the only African-American at the meetings. 
 Mr. Ringo, now president of the Apollo Alliance, a coalition of environmental, labor and business groups, says that even today, he is often the only environmentalist in the room who is not white.
 ''We're not where we were, but we're not where we want to be,'' Mr. Ringo said of the environmental movement's efforts to diversify. 
 National environmental organizations have traditionally drawn their membership from the white and affluent, and have faced criticism for focusing more on protecting resources than protecting people. 
 But with a black president committed to environmental issues in the White House and a need to achieve broader public support for initiatives like federal legislation to address global warming, many environmentalists say they feel pressure to diversify the movement further, both in membership and at higher levels of leadership. 
 ''Our groups are not as diverse as we'd like, but every one of the major groups has diversity as a top priority,'' said Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''There's great commitment to making the environmental movement representative of what the country is.''
 The effort to broaden support comes as the groups find themselves competing with industries that oppose environmental measures, sometimes claiming that they will result in higher energy bills or the loss of jobs. 
 ''The organization has to be able to credibly build trust with communities of color who are going to be targeted by the opponents of change,'' said Sanjay Ranchod, a member of the Sierra Club board who is leading efforts to attract more minorities.
 The need for racial diversity has been a persistent issue in the environmental movement: In 1990, leaders of civil rights and minority groups wrote an open letter that accused the 10 biggest environmental organizations of ''racist'' hiring practices. 
 Richard Moore, one of the letter's signers, said the public indictment was set off by several cases in which the groups had pushed for protection of lands at the expense of minority rural communities.
 Over the years, organizations like the Natural Resources Defense Council have formed partnerships with smaller environmental groups that emerged in the 1980s and '90s to represent the interests of low-income and minority constituencies.
 But more substantial change, Mr. Moore said, has been slow to come.
 ''If you're going to be impacted by an issue, you bring the impacted people to the table,'' said Mr. Moore, who is now executive director of the Southwest Network for Environmental and Economic Justice, a coalition of 60 groups.
 Cara Pike, the author of a 2007 study commissioned by the environmental law group Earthjustice, said the research found that the ''greenest Americans,'' many of them members of environmental groups, were overwhelmingly white, over 45 and college-educated. ''The focus of green groups has been to target the greenest Americans,'' Ms. Pike said, ''and as a result, we've left other people out of the equation.''
 National polls show high environmental concern among minorities. A post-election poll for the National Wildlife Federation in November, for example, found increasing support among blacks and Latinos for candidates keen on addressing global warming. And surveys by the Public Policy Institute of California have found that minorities are sometimes even more concerned than white respondents about environmental issues like air pollution.
 But until recently, social concerns did not appear to be ''on the radar'' of many large environmental organizations, said Julian Agyeman, chairman of the department of urban and environmental policy and planning at Tufts University and author of the 2005 book ''Sustainable Communities and the Challenge of Environmental Justice.''
 Even organizations like the Sierra Club, which has incorporated social justice work since the 1990s, concede that their diversity efforts have failed to gain traction. The organization's executive director, Carl Pope, points at ''cultural barriers'' that in effect shut the door to nonwhites regardless of good intentions.
 ''If you go to a Sierra Club meeting, the people are mostly white, largely over 40, almost all college-educated, whose style is to argue with each other,'' Mr. Pope said. ''That may not be a welcoming environment.''
 Those who join such groups sometimes do not stay long. Marcelo Bonta, 35, who worked for four environmental groups before becoming a diversity consultant in Portland, Ore., five years ago, said he found ''a need to conform,'' down to the way to dress. 
 ''It's the tyranny of fleece,'' Mr. Bonta said. ''I always felt I had to dress down.'' 
 Some larger environmental groups are taking steps to make up for the past. 
 Roger Rivera, president of the National Hispanic Environmental Council, an advocacy group in Washington that promotes environmental careers among Latino students, said that for more than a year he had been attending meetings of the Green Group, a loose association of about three dozen environmental organizations, as ''an observer.''
 Mr. Rivera, who served on President Obama's transition team for the Interior Department, said the Green Group formally invited his organization to join in January -- soon after the election of the first black president, he pointed out. 
 Larry Schweiger, who is chairman of the association and president of the National Wildlife Federation, said the invitation to groups like Mr. Rivera's was ''part of an overall effort to get more engagement in the climate issue.''
 Lisa P. Jackson, whom Mr. Obama appointed as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, emphasized inclusion at a recent conference of environmental justice groups in New York City. Ms. Jackson told the audience that she hoped to bring more diversity to the agency -- its staff of about 1,700 is 69 percent non-Hispanic white -- ''so we look like the people we serve.'' 
 (In addition to Ms. Jackson, who is black, Mr. Obama's environment team includes an Asian, Steven Chu, as energy secretary; a Latino, Ken Salazar, as interior secretary; and Carol M. Browner, who is white, as the coordinator of energy and climate policy.)
 Van Jones, whose national organization, Green for All, was also invited to join the Green Group, said that while environmental justice groups were focused on ''equal protection from bad stuff,'' groups like his wanted ''equal access to good stuff'' and to use green jobs to lift urban youths and others out of poverty.
 ''The more the green movement transforms into a movement for economic opportunity,'' Mr. Jones said, ''the more it will look like America.''

HEADLINE: McClatchy Plans to Cut 15% of Staff

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The McClatchy Company, a major newspaper publisher, said on Monday that it would eliminate 15 percent of its work force, about 1,600 jobs, as it tries to stay ahead of plunging advertising and the debt from its takeover of Knight Ridder in 2006. 
 McClatchy did not say how the cuts would be distributed among its operations, which include The Kansas City Star, The Sacramento Bee, The Miami Herald, The Star-Telegram of Fort Worth, The Charlotte Observer and 25 other dailies, and about 50 small, nondaily papers.
 The entire industry has experienced a sharp drop in ad revenue, particularly in two of the most important states for McClatchy, California and Florida.
 The company lowered expenses by 11.5 percent last year, cutting its work force by almost 25 percent. McClatchy has already announced that after the first quarter of this year, it would suspend its shareholder dividend and contributions to 401(k) and pension plans, and some employees have agreed to lower pay to prevent more layoffs.
 ''Given the worsening economy, we must do more,'' Gary B. Pruitt, the chairman and chief executive, said in a statement released Monday announcing the new downsizing. ''I'm sorry we have to take these actions, but we believe they are necessary.''
 The company said that Mr. Pruitt would take a 15 percent cut in his base pay of $1.1 million, and that other executives would take a 10 percent cut.
 McClatchy reported a net loss for 2008 of just under $4 million, on $1.9 billion in revenue, but that included more than $200 million in noncash charges. Advertising revenue fell 17.9 percent from 2007. The company has $2 billion in debt, most of it from the purchase of Knight Ridder, a larger company, just before the industry began a steep downward spiral.
 McClatchy's stock, which traded above $60 a share before its offer for Knight Ridder, closed on Monday at 41 cents.

HEADLINE: Extravagance Has Its Limits As Belt-Tightening Trickles Up

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN; Karen Ann Cullotta contributed reporting from Chicago, Gretel C. Kovach from Dallas, and Rebecca Cathcart from Los Angeles.

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
It is a sign of the times when Sacha Taylor, a fixture on the charity circuit in this gala-happy city, digs out a 10-year-old dress to wear to a recent society party. 
 Or when Jennifer Riley, a corporate lawyer, starts patronizing restaurants that take coupons.
 Or when Ethel Knox, the wife of a pediatrician, cleans out her home and her storage unit, gives away an old car to a needy friend and cancels the family Christmas. ''I just feel so decadent with all the stuff I've got,'' she explained.
 In just the seven months since the stock market began to plummet, the recession has aimed its death ray not just at the credit market, the Dow and Detroit, but at the very ethos of conspicuous consumption. Even those with a regular income are reassessing their spending habits, perhaps for the long term. They are shopping their closets, downscaling their vacations and holding off on trading in their cars. If the race to have the latest fashions and gadgets was like an endless, ever-faster video game, then someone has pushed the reset button. 
 ''I think this economy was a good way to cure my compulsive shopping habit,'' Maxine Frankel, 59, a high school teacher from Skokie, Ill., said as she longingly stroked a diaphanous black shawl at a shop in the nearby Chicago suburb of Glenview. ''It's kind of funny, but I feel much more satisfied with the things money can't buy, like the well-being of my family. I'm just not seeking happiness from material things anymore.'' 
 To many, the adjustment feels less like a temporary, emergency response than a permanent recalibration, one they view in terms of ethics rather than expediency. 
 ''It's kind of like we all went overboard,'' said Ms. Taylor, 33. ''And we're trying to get back to where we should have been.''
 Not everyone thinks the new restraint will last. Ms. Riley, 37, who lives in Atlanta, said she doubted it would extend beyond the recession.
 ''I do think that maybe now it's a little bit chic or something to save money, or to be pinching pennies,'' she said.
 Just as she stopped carpooling when gas prices went down, Ms. Riley said, she predicted that people would start buying again when the economy rebounded. ''That's just my own, maybe, cynical belief,'' she said.
 Still, economists point out that the Great Depression created a generation of cautious savers. The longer the downturn this time, they say, the more likely it is to change financial habits permanently.
 Holly Moreno, 30, a part-time Web site manager in the Dallas suburb of Rowlett, Tex., whose husband is a business analyst, said she had been taking their 2-year-old son to indoor playgrounds at the mall and free story-times at the library instead of paying to get into the children's museum, their favorite wintertime haunt. 
 ''Even though we're secure with our jobs, you've still got to plan for just-in-case,'' Ms. Moreno said, ''especially because we have a kid.''
 As many economists have noted, cutting spending is the worst thing people with means can do for the economy right now. But that argument seems to have little traction, especially because even those with steady paychecks and no fear of losing their job have seen their net worth decline and their retirement savings evaporate.
 ''I don't think there's been any other period in modern history where appeals to people to spend the economy back into health have worked,'' said Ethan S. Harris, a co-chief of United States economics research at Barclays Capital. ''The only time I've ever seen where that kind of urging people to spend worked was after 9/11, and I did think at the time that there was some patriotic buying going on.''
 After the attacks of Sept. 11, though, President George W. Bush urged Americans to go shopping. President Obama has taken a different tack, issuing a budget whose very title, ''A New Era of Responsibility,'' strives for an austere tone. On Inauguration Day, the first daughters, Sasha and Malia, dressed not in designer labels but clothing from J. Crew. On television, the insurance giant Allstate is running a sepia-toned ''back to basics'' advertising campaign, and in Target's ''new day'' commercials, the ''new pedicure'' is administered by a spouse and the ''new vacation glow'' comes from a spray bottle. 
 ''Though the recession was always talked about in economic terms, we felt really strongly that, in fact, it was a crisis of culture,'' said Tracy Johnson, research director for the Context-Based Research Group, a market research firm in Baltimore that views the recession as a rite-of-passage that will reorder consumer priorities. 
 Ms. Johnson has advised clients to focus on quality rather than quantity. Malls redecorated in screaming red ''sale'' signs are not the way to go, she said, because ''if you just give people the opportunity to buy more, you're not matching up to where their minds are.''
 Carol Morgan, who teaches law at the University of Georgia and whose husband has a private law practice, said she felt a responsibility to cut needless spending. ''That is probably something that is a prudent thing to do in any event, but particularly now I see it as the right thing, as the moral thing to do,'' she said, adding that she also hoped to increase her charitable giving. ''Before, extravagance and opulence was the aspiration, and if we can replace that with a desire to live more simply -- replace that with time with family, or time for spirituality -- what a positive outcome to a very negative situation.''
 Kim Gatlin, a novelist who lives in Park Cities, in the Dallas area, said some of her friends had urged their husbands not to give them jewelry over the holidays. ''They were like, you know, 'There's nothing I'm dying for right now -- let's just wait,' '' she said. ''It makes them feel like they're participating, although they don't contribute to the income stream.'' 
 Even some of the very affluent said they were reluctant to be conspicuous in their spending. 
 ''It's disrespectful to the people who don't have much to flaunt your wealth,'' said Monica Dioda Hagedorn, 40, a lawyer in Atlanta who is married to an heir of the Scotts Miracle-Gro fortune. ''I have plenty of dresses to last me 10 years.'' 
 Ms. Hagedorn said she did not hold herself apart from the rest of society because of her money. ''Everyone's going to pull through together, or everyone's going to sink together,'' she said. 
 Fear and uncertainty have paralyzed even the most insulated clients, said Jack Sawyer Jr., who manages money for some of Atlanta's wealthiest families. ''I have clients who have $20 million, young grandparents, and they're concerned about whether they can continue to pay tuition for their grandchildren. It's not a rational process.''
 Any sharp decline in consumer spending will feed on itself, said Juliet B. Schor, an economist at Boston College and the author of ''The Overspent American: Upscaling, Downshifting and the New Consumer'' (Basic Books, 1998). Typically, people spend when those around them are spending, but in a downturn, the need to compete evaporates. ''You can stay right where you are without falling behind,'' Ms. Schor said. 
 Consumers' focus may have shifted, she said, from striving to catch up to those above them to contemplating the fates of those below them. 
 Craig Robinson, 34, a manager at a real estate investment firm in Atlanta, agreed, saying that he was not tempted to join those who were scooping up deals at department stores. ''There's one guy to the right of me showing me this great deal he got on his tie,'' he said, ''and there's four guys to the left of me who got laid off and can't find a job.''

HEADLINE: Haiti's Despair, Continued

 BODY:
The Department of Homeland Security has decided to continue an ill-advised Bush administration policy of deporting illegal Haitian immigrants. 
 Haiti, already desperately poor, was devastated by storms last year. It is hard to see how an influx of up to 30,000 homeless, jobless people -- the number of Haitians facing deportation from the United States -- would do anything but further destabilize the country as it struggles to recover from what has been called its worst natural disaster in a century. 
 American advocates for Haitians have joined the Haitian government in pleading for an end to the deportations, arguing that all interests are better served by giving the detainees temporary protected status. When a political crisis or natural disaster makes repatriation a bad idea, it is far wiser to allow people to stay put rather than be forced home where they will place further strains on local supplies of food, clean water and housing -- all of which are perilously scarce in Haiti. The Haitian diaspora can do a lot more for its stricken homeland by sending home what is really needed: money. 
 Ending deportations of Haitians would also be consistent. Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans, Hondurans, Salvadorans and others whose countries have been hit by war, earthquakes and hurricanes have routinely been granted protected status in 18-month increments. 
 The strongest argument against doing so is the fear that boatloads of Haitians will take to sea in a deadly gamble to win sanctuary for themselves. That is a legitimate concern. But the best way to address it is by helping to lessen Haiti's misery with aid, trade and investment. Haitians living in this country can help -- but not if they are deported home to a country that is in no condition to accept them.

HEADLINE: A Hiring Bind For Foreigners And Banks

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
What could be worse than graduating from an American business school this year with an interest in banking?
 Being such a graduate who is not a United States citizen.
 A provision in the economic stimulus package limits the hiring of foreign workers by any company receiving government bailout money. In finance, that is nearly every big employer.
 At least one financial institution, Bank of America, has rescinded job offers to foreign citizens, citing the new law, signed by President Obama last month. 
 Some banks are quietly trying to sidestep the limits -- and perhaps to make good on their job offers -- by finding positions abroad for noncitizens, according to college officials.
 Financial institutions seem to be tiptoeing around the core debate about whether it is best to protect American jobs or allow unfettered competition, wishing not to alienate the very lawmakers who are dispensing taxpayer money that is keeping some of them afloat. 
 Absent precise regulations, which have yet to be issued, big banks are being forced to re-examine the hundreds of students that many of them would normally add to their training classes at the end of the academic year. The bill affects people who might have obtained what are called H-1B visas, typically granted to foreign professional workers with skills sought by United States employers. Existing workers are not affected.
 Patricia Rose, director of career services at the University of Pennsylvania, said companies were coming up with ad hoc policies. ''Each bank is consulting with their outside legal counsel,'' she said, ''and trying to determine what they can and cannot do.'' 
 The provision -- sometimes called Made in America, because it is intended to preserve jobs for Americans in this time of distress -- is being criticized by some immigration advocates and deans of business schools, which draw significant numbers of students from overseas.
 ''It sends a protectionist-oriented message that's not necessarily conducive to fostering economic recovery,'' said Bob Sakinawa, associate director of advocacy at the American Immigration Lawyers Association in Washington. People like the business school students affected by the law are valuable assets that the country should use, he said. ''Why cut off that avenue of talent?''
 R. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia's business school, raised concerns about the restrictions on hiring in letters to Timothy F. Geithner, the secretary of the Treasury, and Lawrence H. Summers, head of the National Economic Council. 
 In talking with students recently, Mr. Hubbard called the limits on companies receiving federal bailout funds ''absolutely terrible,'' according to Columbia. He added, ''It gives an advantage to international institutions over American institutions.''
 The number of people affected is small relative to the job losses of late. According to David M. Santos, a spokesman for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the number of H-1B visas is capped at 65,000 annually, with some exceptions. And several big colleges and business schools said the effect on their students was minimal. 
 But the subject of immigration is highly contentious at a time of rapidly rising unemployment.
 ''What the folks at the financial institutions have done is essentially hire people from abroad at lower wages when there are plenty of American workers who can do very fine work,'' said Bernard Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont and a sponsor of the provision. 
 Mr. Sanders said that he was sympathetic to the plight of students whose job offers had vanished. 
 ''I'm sure they're decent, bright young people,'' Mr. Sanders said of business school students from abroad. ''But I also appreciate the people in this country, who have worked their entire lives, who were laid off by the industry. I think they should have the first opportunity.''
 Representatives of several banks declined to comment about the visa issue, including JPMorgan Chase, which according to the government had about 150 H-1B visa applications approved last year, and Citigroup. At Wells Fargo and PNC, representatives said that the visa provision would have very little effect because the companies hired few H-1B workers.
 A spokeswoman for Bank of America confirmed that the company had rescinded job offers to a small number of people who would have needed H-1B visas, citing ''recent changes in legislation.'' The spokeswoman, in an e-mail message, added that the bank ''had very much looked forward to these individuals joining the company.''
 Officials of several colleges and business schools held out hope that when the rules putting the restrictions into effect are issued, they will help resolve concerns. ''We're waiting to see, to better understand for each firm, what the implications will be,'' said Regina Resnick, assistant dean and director of career services at Columbia's business school. ''We've reached out to all the firms that recruit here.''

HEADLINE: Reviving The Dream

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Working families were in deep trouble long before this megarecession hit. But too many of the public officials who should have been looking out for the middle class and the poor were part of the reckless and shockingly shortsighted alliance of conservatives and corporate leaders that rigged the economy in favor of the rich and ultimately brought it down completely.
 As Jared Bernstein, now the chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph Biden, wrote in the preface to his book, ''Crunch: Why Do I Feel So Squeezed? (And Other Unsolved Economic Mysteries)'': 
 ''Economics has been hijacked by the rich and powerful, and it has been forged into a tool that is being used against the rest of us.''
 Working people were not just abandoned by big business and their ideological henchmen in government, they were exploited and humiliated. They were denied the productivity gains that should have rightfully accrued to them. They were treated ruthlessly whenever they tried to organize. They were never reasonably protected against the savage dislocations caused by revolutions in technology and global trade.
 Working people were told that all of this was good for them, and whether out of ignorance or fear or prejudice or, as my grandfather might have said, damned foolishness, many bought into it. They signed onto tax policies that worked like a three-card monte game. And they were sold a snake oil concoction called ''trickle down'' that so addled their brains that they thought it was a wonderful idea to hand over their share of the nation's wealth to those who were already fabulously rich.
 America used to be better than this.
 The seeds of today's disaster were sown some 30 years ago. Looking at income patterns during that period, my former colleague at The Times, David Cay Johnston, noted that from 1980 (the year Ronald Reagan was elected) to 2005, the national economy, adjusted for inflation, more than doubled. (Because of population growth, the actual increase per capita was about 66 percent.)
 But the average income for the vast majority of Americans actually declined during those years. The standard of living for the average family improved not because incomes grew but because women entered the workplace in droves.
 As hard as it may be to believe, the peak income year for the bottom 90 percent of Americans was way back in 1973, when the average income per taxpayer, adjusted for inflation, was $33,000. That was nearly $4,000 higher, Mr. Johnston pointed out, than in 2005.
 Men have done particularly poorly. Men who are now in their 30s -- the prime age for raising families -- earn less money than members of their fathers' generation did at the same age.
 It may seem like ancient history, but in the first few decades following World War II, the United States, despite many serious flaws, established the model of a highly productive society that shared its prosperity widely and made investments that were geared toward a more prosperous, more fulfilling future.
 The American dream was alive and well and seemingly unassailable. But somehow, following the oil shocks, the hyperinflation and other traumas of the 1970s, Americans allowed the right-wingers to get a toehold -- and they began the serious work of smothering the dream.
 Ronald Reagan saw Medicare as a giant step on the road to socialism. Newt Gingrich, apparently referring to the original fee-for-service version of Medicare, which was cherished by the elderly, cracked, ''We don't get rid of it in Round One because we don't think it's politically smart.''
 The right-wingers were crafty: You smother the dream by crippling the programs that support it, by starving the government of money to pay for them, by funneling the government's revenues to the rich through tax cuts and other benefits, by looting the government the way gangsters loot legitimate businesses and then pleading poverty when it comes time to fund the services required by the people.
 The anti-tax fanatic Grover Norquist summed the matter up nicely when he famously said, ''Our goal is to shrink the government to the size where you can drown it in a bathtub.'' Only they didn't shrink the government, they enlarged it and turned its bounty over to the rich.
 Now, with the economy in free fall and likely to get worse, Americans -- despite their suffering -- have an opportunity to reshape the society, and then to move it in a fairer, smarter and ultimately more productive direction. That is the only way to revive the dream, but it will take a long time and require great courage and sacrifice.
 The right-wingers do not want that to happen, which is why they are rooting so hard for President Obama's initiatives to fail. They like the direction that the country took over the past 30 years. They'd love to do it all again.

HEADLINE: Wondering If Crude Could Fall Even More

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
In recent weeks, as oil traded around $40 a barrel, the conventional wisdom among specialists was that the price decline that began last summer was largely over. Amid production cuts by the OPEC cartel, oil had apparently found a floor that would last until the global economy rebounded.
 But a growing chorus of analysts and economists is questioning that notion. While theirs is a minority view, they see troubling conditions in the oil market that could still push prices down sharply -- and a global economy that is getting worse, not better. Some are predicting that oil could fall to $20 a barrel and stay low for years.
 Petroleum executives generally do not regard this prospect as likely. But in a year when dire predictions about the economy keep coming true, they fear it is a possibility. Another big drop could lead to a sustained period of low investments, and many executives say that would set the stage for prices to soar once the global economy finally starts to recover.
 ''The industry needs reasonable prices,'' Zhou Jiping, the vice president of the China National Petroleum Corporation, said at a conference last month in Houston held by Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''If prices stay below $40 a barrel, a large number of wells have to be shut down.'' 
 Lower oil prices have provided a welcome break in a tough economy. Gasoline, which peaked above $4 a gallon last summer, now sells for $1.94 on average. The drop has saved consumers billions of dollars.
 But the concern about lower oil prices crimping new investment is shared by experts at the International Energy Agency, a leading forecaster, which has repeatedly warned that a ''supply crunch'' within the next five years could push prices to new records. 
 Among the community of analysts who track the oil markets closely, the view that prices could keep falling in the near term is not widely held. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, they point out, is propping up the market by cutting production. OPEC has announced three production cuts since September. 
 Indeed, prices have been rising in the last three weeks as traders calculate that the cartel will announce another cut at a meeting this weekend in Vienna. Oil closed in New York trading on Monday at $47.07 a barrel, up $1.55 and well above the recent low of $33 a barrel in December.
 But as the global economic outlook worsens, the view that prices have farther to fall seems to be gaining adherents.
 The debate is not just a proxy for varying predictions about the economy. It also reflects divergent opinions about the future of the oil business, which has been rocked by an unprecedented boom-and-bust cycle in recent months.
 Predicting oil prices is a tricky business. As prices rose to $147 a barrel last year, some analysts suggested that oil would reach $200 a barrel. Instead, prices plummeted after their July peak, dropping by more than $100 since the summer. The recent rise has not altered the view of the camp that believes the fall in oil prices is not over.
 One of the biggest uncertainties is whether today's market will mirror the early 1980s, when prices collapsed and stayed low for much of the next two decades, or whether it will prove more like 1998, when prices fell to $10 a barrel after the Asian financial crisis but rebounded within a few years as growth picked up.
 With the global economy worsening and demand slowing, some economists, including Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard and Nouriel Roubini of New York University, say oil prices could keep declining in the short term. 
 ''The twin engines of growth were the U.S. and China; the U.S. has fallen off and China has stalled, to put it mildly,'' Mr. Roubini said. ''In my scenario, oil will fall lower. I would not be surprised if oil even went to $20, if the recession is more severe.''
 While many analysts expect oil demand to rebound sharply once the economy recovers, not everyone agrees that prices are necessarily going to soar at that point.
 Edward L. Morse, the chief economist at the New York broker LCM Commodities, says that each energy shock in the last 60 years resulted in lower growth for oil demand in succeeding years. 
 This time, he said, should be no different. ''The case is overpowering,'' Mr. Morse said. 
 Before the energy crisis of 1973, he said, global oil demand was growing at 8 percent a year. But by the late 1970s, as many countries found ways to use less oil, that rate of growth had slowed to 4 percent a year. Similarly, after the oil shock caused by the Iranian revolution, demand growth slowed to 2 percent a year. And in the decade after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, consumption increased 1.5 percent to 1.8 percent a year. 
 Mr. Morse estimates that in the next recovery, global oil demand will grow perhaps 1 percent a year, because of lower demand growth in the United States, China and the Middle East. 
 In the longer term, another factor may keep prices down. As OPEC trims its output in the face of falling demand, it automatically raises the amount of spare production capacity.
 After years with a thin cushion -- a factor in pushing prices up -- the market now has at least five million barrels a day of untapped output potential. That level could rise to as high as eight million barrels a day by the end of the year, according to estimates by cartel officials, a level unseen in more than a decade. The last time that happened, prices stayed low for years. 
 ''By any economic measure, we still have much more downside for oil prices,'' said Adam J. Robinson, director of commodities at Armored Wolf, a California hedge fund. 
 For the moment, the market's focus is on consumption rather than supplies. In China, for example, oil consumption, which had been growing at more than 10 percent a year, fell by 4 percent in December, according to the International Energy Agency. This year, the agency expects ''paltry'' growth of 0.7 percent in Chinese oil demand. 
 In the United States last year, demand plummeted 6 percent, the steepest decline in nearly three decades. With Americans traveling less because of the bad economy, the demand for jet fuel fell 11 percent in January, compared with a year earlier. 
 A period of lower oil prices could also slow investments in alternative energy, a sector that is already suffering from the credit crisis and the economic slowdown. Without government subsidies, many technologies cannot compete with oil at today's prices. 
 Some oil executives, however, have sought to remain optimistic, saying that costs for oil companies are beginning to fall. 
 ''I remember a time when I thought $40 was a fantastic price,'' said Tony Hayward, chief executive of BP. ''Not much has changed, but we allowed our cost base to get ahead of us. The industry worked very well at $40 a barrel four years ago.''

HEADLINE: Down Economic Times Elicit Upbeat Campaigns

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
SAY goodbye to the dutiful Quaker Man who declared of his namesake oatmeal, ''Nothing is better for thee than me.'' He and the Quaker Oats division of PepsiCo are clambering aboard a fast-moving marketing bandwagon by offering upbeat exhortations during these tough economic times.
 ''Go humans go'' is the theme of a major campaign getting under way for Quaker Oats. The theme acts as an umbrella under which all the division's oat-based products are being peddled; as an announcer in a commercial declares, ''The power of Quaker is in everything we make.'' 
 Television, print, online (quakeroats.com/gohumansgo) and outdoor ads -- along with promotions and events around the country -- proclaim that the Quaker oat is a ''super grain'' that ''gives you a little lift, physically and emotionally'' and ''makes you feel good knowing you're doing something good for yourself.''
 It seems counterintuitive to accentuate the positive amid all the downbeat financial news. But Madison Avenue is typically a place called Hope. Besides, gloom-mongering could convince consumers to put off what little spending they still intend.
 ''You could always look at the glass as half-full or half-empty,'' Annie Young-Scrivner, chief marketing officer and vice president for sales at the Quaker foods and snacks division, said on Monday at an event in Times Square to introduce the campaign.
 ''We look at it half-full,'' she added, which suits ''a very iconic brand'' like Quaker.
 As Quaker Oats cheers on the human race, Visa has a campaign that also plays up the word go, which carries the theme ''More people go with Visa.'' And the Hillshire Farm unit of Sara Lee is running a humorous campaign under the banner ''Go meat!''
 Those go-go ads join a lengthening list of cockeyed marketers sponsoring campaigns carrying optimistic themes. They include Bank of America, with ''Bank of opportunity''; Coca-Cola, with ''Open happiness''; the Pepsi-Cola soft drink sold by PepsiCo, with ads in which the o's in words like ''hope'' are replaced by a logo resembling a smiling face; and Western Union, with a one-word burst of positivity: ''Yes!''
 ''We did a great deal of research around the globe,'' said Gail Galuppo, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Western Union in Englewood, Colo., and determined that customers were still ''working hard in pursuit of their dreams.''
 ''In a world today where they hear a lot of 'no' and 'maybe,' '' she added, ''we wanted to say 'yes' to them.'' The Western Union campaign is by the Hong Kong office of Publicis Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe.
 The Quaker campaign, with a budget estimated at more than $100 million, is being created by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group. Another Omnicom agency, OMD, is handling the media part of the campaign.
 Edelman, part of Daniel J. Edelman Inc., is publicizing elements of the campaign like the Go Project, through which Quaker Oats will donate food to Share Our Strength, and Go Grants, $500 stipends from Quaker to consumers to start efforts to fight hunger in local communities. 
 Many campaigns that are trying to put on a happy face during hard times are including charitable or philanthropic aspects to increase their feel-good appeal to feel-bad consumers.
 The Quaker campaign is about ''leveraging human energy to fuel your day,'' Ms. Young-Scrivner said, ''and also leveraging human energy to do more for others.''
 The development of the campaign began last summer.
 ''Obviously, economic conditions are definitely a factor'' in marketing decisions, Ms. Young-Scrivner said, but the premise of the campaign to ''fuel yourself to be your very best'' ought to resonate in a recession.
 A TV commercial and an accompanying print ad reflect that attitude, minus any presidents, by showing a man flying to work with a jetpack on his back powered by two packages of Old Fashioned Quaker Oats.
 A second ad compares Quaker Instant Oatmeal to a ramp that can send a child's bicycle soaring into the air. A third ad, likening Quaker Chewy Granola Bars to a spring, urges shoppers to ''put a little spring in your step.''
 The fourth ad depicts a section of the oatmeal package in the shape of a heart. ''Take good care of your heart, and your heart will take good care of you,'' the text reads. ''Quaker Oatmeal has been helping lower cholesterol for 20 years.''
 The campaign represents the first work for Quaker Oats from Goodby, Silverstein since being selected last fall as the company's lead creative agency. Goodby, Silverstein won the assignment from another Omnicom agency, Element 79 Partners.
 ''Every once in a while as an advertising agency, you are presented with a brand that has great familiarity, great perceptions attached to it, but it's out there in a latent phase,'' said Jamie Barrett, partner and creative director at Goodby, Silverstein.
 The campaign offers ''a focus and a mission for the products as a brand,'' he added, which ought to increase product sales as it burnishes the image of the brand.
 The ads have a contemporary attitude, Mr. Barrett said, while at the same time acknowledging the heritage of Quaker Oats.
 ''The Quaker Man has been an icon for more than a century,'' he added, ''so we wanted to make sure what we did was true to the brand, served up in a way that rang true and doesn't take it to a place that's not genuine.''
 The campaign began last week with so-called teaser ads, billboards and signs in a dozen large markets that showed only parts of the Quaker Man. The ''reveal'' came on Monday at the event in Times Square, along with material on the Quaker Oats Web site explaining the campaign.
 The jetpack TV commercial is scheduled to start next Monday, along with newspaper ads; outdoor ads bearing the ''Go humans go'' theme, appearing in 20 large markets; and ads on Web sites like health.com and instyle.com.
 Magazine ads are planned for later this month, as are activities involving bloggers.

HEADLINE: Mathematical Model and the Mortgage Mess

BYLINE: By DENNIS OVERBYE

 BODY:
There was no mathematical elegance to the mortgage-backed securities that helped lead to the market crash of recent months. In these deals, interest and principal payments from mortgages were bundled into different packages called tranches, each with different risks and interest rates. 
 The only tricky part of these deals, quants say, was in estimating how often people would default on these mortgages, and how correlated those defaults were. For that you need a model. The more people act in concert, the less diversity in your investment and the greater the chances of disaster. 
 The model for correlation came from other securities in which corporate bonds were pooled in tranches. In 2000, David X. Li, a banker with a doctorate in statistics who was then at RiskMetrics, part of J. P. Morgan Chase, began using mathematical functions called Gaussian copulas to estimate the likelihood of corporations' dying in unison. (It was an idea borrowed from the life insurance industry, where copulas measure the correlations between deaths of spouses.)
 Since such defaults were rare to nonexistent in the boom years of the 1990s, for which he had data, Dr. Li looked at correlations between the prices of insuring corporate bonds as a proxy.
 The Wall Street Journal called these copulas ''a produce scale that not only weighs a bag of apples but estimates the chance that they'll all be rotten in a week.'' Dr. Li's work helped fuel the ultimately disastrous growth of credit derivatives, even though Dr. Li himself worried out loud that people were taking its results too seriously.
 By the middle of 2008, 25 percent of subprime mortgages and 9 percent of all mortgages in the United States were in default or foreclosure, undermining the entire banking system.
 ''Recent events have invalidated all the models we had,'' said Emanuel Derman, a Columbia University professor and former Goldman Sachs quant. It turned out the whole bag was rotten.

HEADLINE: A Stylista Stands Out in Leather and Bullets

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
Matthew Anderson, 25, is a freelance wardrobe stylist from St. Louis who moved to New York from Atlanta in May 2007. His parents -- an education administrator and a manager at Clear Channel Communications -- love his passion for fashion, and had him style them for a New Year's Eve ball. 
 Discovering fashion: I was introverted when I was young, but in my junior or senior year of high school, I began to express my own style. I would mix stuff up and cut things up and put glitter and studs on things. I used fabric glue and glitter and borrowed my mom's stud gun. 
 Day job: I work as a sales associate at the Juicy Couture flagship store on Fifth Avenue. I got the job through good old-fashioned connections.
 Current look: Right now I have on vintage military boots with yellow shoestrings in one and Spiderman shoestrings in the other, a leather vest with a fur collar, and Abercrombie cargo pants that used to have two parachute straps, but one got caught in a subway door and ripped off. My bracelet was a gift; it's made of leather and bullets. 
 Fashion icons: Patricia Field, Tom Ford, Betsey Johnson and my ultimate icon, John Galliano.
 Various wardrobe accessories: 35 pairs of running shoes (8 of them Converse); 15 baseball hats; 5 newspaper boy hats; 3 skullcaps (one sequined); 1 faux fur beret; 2 bowlers; 1 green fedora; 1 rabbit fur ski hat, 1 paint-splattered leather tie; a bag of necklaces and earrings; and 1 small animal pelt. I think it's a mink. I got it around the corner from my apartment in Bed-Stuy at this vintage shop that smells like cat pee. 
 Breaking into the fashion world: It's tough; it's a networking game. It's a lot about what people you meet, and people trusting you and then wanting to bring you in. There's so many people hungry for it, and there has to be something that makes you special. 
 Best New York City gig so far: I went to the Hiro Ballroom and met this woman. She said she was shooting something in the meatpacking district with Andre J. -- he's a socialite -- and I told her I was a stylist. They ended up calling me the next morning, and I met them for the shoot, with the makeup artist. I directed some of the positions and also supplied the jewelry. It's funny how things can change overnight. 
 Frequency of spotting fashion disasters: Oh, God. Every single day. You see people wearing the most horrendous, horrendous things that make absolutely no sense. An example: I saw a woman dressed head to toe in Pepto-Bismol pink. Or you see people wearing horrible prints, or things that are too tight and show indents and cellulite. 
 On emergency fashion interventions: I can say, ''You look crazy -- take that off'' to my clients and friends. But not to strangers.
 Recently spotted fashion ''do'': This guy came into Juicy Couture. He looked so amazing. He was wearing a black Gumby hat, big black circle glasses, an oversize black cardigan and black bow tie, pants that were tight and billowed out at the thigh and black boots. But people that look like that never end up buying anything. I feel the true shoppers come in sweat pants. 
 Dream job: Creative director of a fashion production company. They do everything from runway production to editorials to celebrity styling for the red carpet.
 Doesn't the economic crisis make fashion superfluous? No, fashion is a lifestyle. It's stimulating; it's an expression. You've got to live your life and have fun.

HEADLINE: The Long Trip Home

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
When employees and their families go overseas, many assume that adjusting to a foreign culture will be the hardest part of their assignment. But the challenges of returning home are often greater, especially now when companies are bringing some back early to save money. 
 Margery M. Marshall, president of Vandover, a global transition support company, said that big financial services companies, in particular, have accelerated repatriation in recent months. 
 ''It's scary,'' she said. ''That guarantee of a job? You may see that plummet. And what's doubly scary is the spouse or partner gave up a career to go overseas and now has to start over and go back to work.''
 The economic worries have added another layer to the difficulties of returning home after a stint overseas. Craig Storti, author of ''The Art of Coming Home,'' said, ''The main assumption people make is they're coming home -- that can't be hard.'' But, he said, they are caught off-guard when it is not as smooth as they expect. 
 ''You had the seminal experience of your life,'' he said. ''Even family members and close friends just can't relate.'' Both the expatriates and people at home have changed and moved on. What they do not realize, Mr. Storti said, is that the host country becomes home and ''home'' is not the place it was.
 That was the case for Larry and Sally DiLoreto, who returned to the Boston area last summer with their three children after spending more than four years in Sydney, Australia. They had lived a block from the beach, enjoyed the mild weather and the outside-oriented lifestyle. They miss their friends and the ease of traveling to nearby countries. 
 ''We were just plucked from life,'' said Mr. DiLoreto, who was sent to Australia by Progress Software, based in Bedford, Mass. For William, 7, their oldest child, who attended an all-boys school, adjusting to school is taking time. 
 In fact, experts say, children who are returning home frequently have difficulty with school. Children educated abroad often attend private or international schools, many of which are more challenging than American public schools. The children may be more sophisticated than their America peers. Teenagers are the hardest hit, Mr. Storti said. ''They suffer a lot, more than any other group, by far.''
 Some companies offer repatriation training in which the employees and their families discuss their feelings and experiences and learn strategies and skills to cope with re-entry. 
 But Dottie Byers, managing director of International Professional Relations, said, ''repatriation training is not routinely offered,'' despite its relatively modest cost. Repatriation sessions for a family typically last one day and cost $3,000 to $3,500, she said. And companies that do offer it, like AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company that is one of Ms. Byers's clients, say employees are frequently not interested because they do not recognize the value.
 Ashley Daly, senior manager of international assignments at AstraZeneca, said more employees are open to assistance before heading abroad -- for help with moving, to locate schools or to learn a language -- but not when returning. 
 What has been effective, Ms. Daly said, is the company's recent emphasis on a ''more thoughtful planning and selection process'' of candidates before they go overseas. 
 Achim Mossmann, managing director of global mobility advisory services for KPMG, an accounting firm, said ''companies lose employees because they don't plan well.'' If the company has not created a challenging position that uses the employees' new overseas experience and skills, they often go to a competing company. And losing talented staff is expensive.
 ''It is difficult to sell to top management that re-entry is a problem,'' said Geoffrey W. Latta, executive vice president of ORC Worldwide, a human resources consulting firm. ''Companies don't think big picture.'' 
 A KPMG survey, ''Global Assignment Policies and Practices,'' released in December, found that just 4 percent of the 430 human resources executives surveyed said that they effectively manage the repatriation process. 
 Required home base visits and mentoring programs also help assignees stay connected to the home office.
 Mr. DiLoreto, who returned from Australia as vice president for Asia Pacific field operations for Progress Software, said he had kept in close contact with company headquarters with weekly calls and visits six times a year. He also said the company recognized his professional development while overseas and the autonomy he enjoyed ''being thrown in different cultures -- surviving and growing.'' He continues to oversee Asia, but he has been given the additional territories of North and Latin America, a position he believes will continue to challenge him.
 Mr. Latta said most companies are careful not to promise advancement on return but many employees ''assume they will be promoted and are clearly unhappy if they are not.'' A guarantee of a job and even a promotion was almost standard 30 years ago for overseas assignments, but in recent years, most companies have been unwilling to commit.
 Ms. Marshall of Vandover said the problems of relocation and downsizing were starting to merge. ''It's a whole lot more challenging than a year ago,'' she said.

HEADLINE: A Zealous Watchman To Follow the Money

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
There is an alligator head in Earl E. Devaney's office, with a tiny camera concealed inside. The covert pictures it snapped in a Louisiana bayou caught an Interior Department official on a fishing trip he had accepted as a bribe, but today the stuffed gator lives on as a toothy deterrent to corruption.
 ''When an assistant secretary comes in and asks about it, I tell that story and they get a little unnerved,'' said Mr. Devaney, the inspector general for the Interior Department and the man President Obama has chosen to police the spending of the $787 billion stimulus package. 
 In 38 years of government service, Mr. Devaney, a hulking former college football lineman and Secret Service man, has been unnerving would-be miscreants. But now the Big Man, as Mr. Devaney's colleagues call him, is taking on an incomparably bigger job, tracking a sum 50 times the agency's annual budget as chairman of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board -- or as the irresistible acronym has it, RAT Board. 
 Squeezed with other honorees into the box of the first lady, Michelle Obama, for the president's address to Congress on Feb. 24, Mr. Devaney looked uneasy in the spotlight, a deadpan Joe Friday at a political spectacle. But he likes the assignment.
 ''It's sort of the Super Bowl of oversight,'' said Mr. Devaney, 61, in an interview between hunting for office space and recruiting staff members. He has $84 million to run his office through September 2011, out of some $350 million for oversight.
 The stimulus is a bet-the-farm wager on the economy with few precedents in American history, and Mr. Devaney's appointment has been widely praised for assuring tough scrutiny.
 ''He's out of central casting as the old-time street cop who's seen it all,'' said Danielle Brian, executive director for the Project on Government Oversight, an advocacy group in Washington. 
 Unlike inspectors general who soft-pedal criticism of agency brass, Ms. Brian added, Mr. Devaney ''never got the memo that said he wasn't supposed to be a junkyard dog.''
 The job, however, comes with a glaring contradiction. Speedy spending is considered critical to jump-starting the economy. Still, Mr. Devaney must make sure the billions shoveled out the Treasury door in such a hurry are neither wasted nor stolen. He said he was aware of the tension and hoped to deter waste and fraud not with an alligator head, but with a Web site, Recovery.gov, with voluminous details on every dollar spent.
 ''I want to make it possible for Mr. and Mrs. Smith in Ohio to see exactly how the money is spent,'' Mr. Devaney said. 
 If a project that promised to create 1,000 jobs only creates 100, the failure will be recorded, he said: ''The good, the bad and the ugly will all be on that Web site.'' 
 Not all believe the federal government is capable of such candor, and so far, an independent site, StimulusWatch.org, easily outclasses Recovery.gov. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, called Mr. Devaney ''independent and highly effective'' but said the RAT board ''puts another layer of bureaucracy between taxpayers and the truth'' about how the money is spent.
 The only child of a middle-class couple in Reading, Mass., Mr. Devaney studied government at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania. The quarterback he helped protect, D. J. Korns, recalls Mr. Devaney's steady leadership in a fraternity and stoicism on the football field, where his bad shoulder would pop out of joint, a trainer would snap it back in, and he would return to the fray. ''It was so painful I couldn't watch,'' Mr. Korns said.
 Hooked on law enforcement after working summers as a police officer on Cape Cod, Mr. Devaney went directly from graduation to the Secret Service in 1970. He protected presidents -- he liked the recent film ''Frost/Nixon'' for its portrait of that president -- and once was shot at by a disturbed woman who mistook him for President Gerald R. Ford. She missed, and he went on to build a new fraud division in the Secret Service.
 In 1991, he was hired to create a criminal enforcement division for the Environmental Protection Agency. Felicia Marcus, who worked with him as a regional administrator at that agency in the 1990s -- and whom he once saved from a purse-snatcher -- said he was tough but reasonable with polluters.
 ''He listens, but no one pushes this guy around,'' Ms. Marcus said.
 Arriving at the Interior Department in 1999, Mr. Devaney found a ''broken'' inspector general's office, said Mary Kendall, his deputy there. Senior officials told him they had never before met any of his predecessors and that they threw out reports unread because they were so dense.
 Mr. Devaney created a special unit to focus on the most serious cases, which had routinely languished, created a system for identifying the programs at highest risk of failure, and ordered that reports no longer be written in ''auditese or cop talk,'' as he called it. When programs worked, he praised them, to build trust with the work force.
 The 2004 investigation of the official photographed in the bayou, a Louisiana regional supervisor who accepted fishing trips from a contractor, was one in a parade of Interior Department scandals involving drugs and sex, free-spending lobbyists and unpaid oil royalties. Mr. Devaney speaks of his beat at the department with a mix of relish and dismay. 
 ''Everything everyone would want is here,'' he said. ''Water, land, minerals, oil and gas and the ever-popular Indian gaming.''
 The job has proved frustrating at times. In 2004, his first report on J. Steven Griles, the deputy secretary who was close to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, documented 25 ethical lapses, he said. But the interior secretary, Gale A. Norton, shrugged it off.
 ''She said she'd talked to him, and he wouldn't do it again,'' Mr. Devaney said. ''Three years later, he was in jail.'' (Ms. Norton, now at the oil giant Royal Dutch Shell, declined to comment.)
 That frustration was on display at a 2006 hearing when Mr. Devaney declared, ''Simply stated, short of a crime, anything goes at the highest levels of the Department of the Interior.''
 Jeff Ruch, who runs the whistle-blower group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, is a rare critic, calling Mr. Devaney ''the deflector general'' for emphasizing sensational corruption cases over more fundamental change.
 But Ms. Brian of the Project on Government Oversight said a little showmanship was useful. ''He's figured out that a lot of his impact is deterrence, and that means making a splash,'' she said.
 Nearly three years ago, Mr. Devaney told Federal Times in a rare interview that he was ''in the fall of my career'' and had ''no aspirations other than to play more golf.'' Now, contemplating the stimulus job, he said that was a miscalculation.
 ''It turned out to be early fall,'' Mr. Devaney said. ''Or maybe late summer.''

HEADLINE: Ethics Conflict at Harvard Medical School

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Patching a Wound: Working to End Conflicts at Harvard Medical'' (Business Day, March 3):
 It came as no surprise that an article about medical students finally appeared on the business page. It is quite simple to see that academic medicine not only at Harvard but I suspect in most schools is no longer academic but economic. 
 A paid employee of a drug company does not fit the classic role of the professor exercising academic freedom and the Hippocratic responsibility to pass on the profession. A dean concerned about and creatively using words to support an economic model of training is a clear sign that the for-profit model of medicine, which has overtaken the hospital world, now owns the educational process as well. 
 Saddest of all are the students who, because of their sense of entitlement, don't see the problem. The sad fact is that more and more students choose specialties for economic reasons rather than fields like geriatrics and primary care that are most needed by society.
 The entitlement of wealth is unfortunately not the only ethical slope that is steepening for students. Several years ago, in an ethics discussion, I was shocked to hear students defend multiple intrusive examinations of unconscious patients as necessary ''in order for us to learn.''
 Health care must be seen as a right that provides not economic rewards but care always, cure sometimes and respect and justice for all. I congratulate the students who have spoken out in defense of this right.

 To the Editor:
 Your article oversimplifies a real issue. Most drug discovery and essentially all drug development is financed by private capital seeking profit. Experts in biomedical sciences and diseases who work in universities and hospitals are needed to advise drug development programs.
 Patients for clinical trials are available at these institutions. Until drug development financing is changed, company grants to institutions for clinical trials are the only way clinical trials will be financed. If the best professionals and institutions are precluded from receiving clinical trial expense money, the quality of clinical trials may be impaired.
 There have been too many real and harmful conflicts of interest in medicine to be ignored, and disclosure alone may be insufficient. But money given an institution to support research must be differentiated from money given to an individual. 
 The pendulum has swung too far, tainting everybody involved with financed drug research by assuming they automatically have a conflict of interest. This distracts from addressing real conflicts of interest and unnecessarily impairs the process of getting better medicines.

HEADLINE: Workers Without Borders

BYLINE: By JENNIFER GORDON. 
Jennifer Gordon is a professor of labor and immigration law at Fordham Law School.

 BODY:
AMERICANS are hardly in the mood to welcome new immigrants. The last thing we need, the reasoning goes, is more competition for increasingly scarce jobs. But the need for immigration reform is more urgent than ever. The current system hurts wages and working conditions -- for everyone.
 Today, millions of undocumented immigrants accept whatever wage is offered. They don't protest out of fear of being fired or deported. A few hundred thousand guest workers, brought in for seasonal and agricultural jobs, know that asserting their rights could result in a swift flight home. This system traps migrants in bad jobs and ends up lowering wages all around. 
 The solution lies in greater mobility for migrants and a new emphasis on workers' rights. If migrants could move between jobs, they would be free to expose abusive employers. They would flow to regions with a shortage of workers, and would also be able to return to their home countries when the outlook there brightened, or if jobs dried up here. 
 Imagine if the United States began admitting migrants on the condition that they join a network of workers' organizations here and in their home countries -- a sort of transnational union. Migrants could work here legally. They could take jobs anywhere in the country and stay as long as they liked. But they would have to promise to report employers that violated labor laws. They could lose their visas by breaking that promise.
 This plan, which I call Transnational Labor Citizenship, would give employers access to many more workers on fair terms. It would give people from countries like Mexico greater opportunities to earn the remittances upon which their families and economies rely. It would address the inconsistency and inhumanity of policies that support free trade in goods and jobs but bar the free movement of people.
 How could we make this happen? Congress could certainly mandate the change. If that seems unlikely, we could start with a bilateral labor migration agreement with a country like Mexico, making membership in a transnational workers' organization and a commitment to uphold workplace laws a requirement for Mexicans to obtain work here. 
 We might try a smaller pilot project involving a single union in an industry like residential construction or agriculture. One model would be the Farm Labor Organizing Committee's guest worker union, which protects migrant agricultural workers on some North Carolina farms. The union provides representation and benefits wherever the workers are. It has organizers near North Carolina's tobacco and cucumber fields, and an office in Mexico, where the laborers return home for the winter.
 Migrant mobility has been tried with success in the European Union. When the Union expanded in 2004 to include eight Eastern European countries, workers in Western Europe feared a flood of job seekers who would drive down wages. In Britain, for example, the volume of newcomers from countries like Poland was staggering. Instead of the prediction of roughly 50,000 migrants in four years, more than a million arrived. 
 Yet, as far as economists can tell, the influx did not take a serious toll on native workers' wages or employment. (Of course, what happens in the global downturn remains to be seen.) Migrants who were not trapped in exploitative jobs flocked to areas that needed workers and shunned the intense competition of big cities. And when job opportunities grew in Poland or shrank in Britain, fully half went home again. 
 To be sure, Europe's approach has its problems. Some migrants were cheated on their wages and worked in unsafe conditions. This illustrates that mobility alone is not enough. We also need good workplace protections, and effective support to realize them. 
 Unions could play a key role in rights enforcement if they embraced migrants as potential members, becoming for the first time truly transnational institutions. And government could partner with workers' organizations. Recently, the New York Department of Labor announced that it had begun to work with immigrant centers and unions to catch violators. This is a promising example of a new alliance to protect the rights of both immigrants and native-born workers.
 Like it or not, until we address the vast inequalities across the globe, those who want to migrate will find a way. Despite stepped-up enforcement at the borders, hundreds of thousands of immigrants still come illegally to the United States every year. Raids terrorize immigrants but do not make them go home. Instead, rigid quotas, harsh immigration laws and heavy-handed enforcement lock people in. As the recession deepens, undocumented immigrants will hunker down more. They may work less, for worse pay, but they will be terrified to go home out of fear they can never return.
 The United States needs an open and fair system, not a holding pen. The best way forward is to create an immigration system with protection for all workers at its core.

HEADLINE: With Merck Deal, New Jersey Braces for Big Drug Industry Job Cuts

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN; A. G. Sulzberger contributed reporting.

 BODY:
One of the more flattering things New Jersey has been called is ''the nation's medicine chest.'' But that is becoming less appropriate as the roster of giant drug-making companies based in the state dwindles.
 On Monday, two of the biggest pharmaceutical companies with headquarters in New Jersey, Merck and Schering-Plough, announced plans to merge and eliminate about 16,000 jobs. That announcement came just six weeks after Pfizer, based in Manhattan, said it would buy Wyeth, which is based in Madison, N.J. 
 If the deals are consummated by the end of this year as expected, New Jersey will be home to two fewer Fortune 500 companies, and its status as the leading location for pharmaceutical companies and their high-paying jobs will have slipped a bit further. Analysts said they expected the trend toward consolidation to continue, portending more job losses in the state.
 ''It's tough on New Jersey and it's tough on the economy,'' said Dr. Jon LeCroy, who follows pharmaceutical stocks for Natixis Bleichroeder in New York. ''These are also mergers of desperation, you could say. The biggest thing they're going to do is try to cut costs.''
 Indeed, Merck executives said they expected to eliminate about 15 percent of the jobs at Merck, which is based in Whitehouse Station, and Schering-Plough, based in Kenilworth. Together, the companies employ more than 105,000 people worldwide. Dr. LeCroy said he expected Pfizer to close Wyeth's headquarters, where more than 900 Wyeth employees work. 
 Those losses would accelerate the decline in New Jersey's share of jobs in the pharmaceutical industry. Estimates of the total number of jobs in that field vary because some of the biggest drug makers also make medical supplies and consumer products. For example, Johnson & Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J., makes everything from baby oil and bandages to cancer treatments.
 The HealthCare Institute of New Jersey estimates that the state has about 60,000 biopharmaceutical jobs, or about 10 percent of the worldwide total. But James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said that by a narrower definition, the state's employment in drug manufacturing was about 41,000 jobs.
 That number, Mr. Hughes said, amounted to less than 15 percent of the nation's jobs in that industry -- still a high concentration, but down from more than 20 percent in 1990.
 Many of the new jobs have been created in places like San Diego and the area around Boston, where biotechnology research institutes serve as magnets. California overtook New Jersey as the state with the most pharmaceutical industry jobs five years ago, Mr. Hughes said.
 Still, New Jersey has remained the most popular place for world and regional headquarters of the big drug makers and, until recently, that has been a boon for the state. The pharmaceutical jobs in New Jersey have paid more, on average, than those elsewhere. According to figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average weekly wage of the industry's jobs in New Jersey last year was almost $2,100, about 30 percent higher than the national average for such jobs.
 Drug companies based in the New York metropolitan area have been building plants in places like North Carolina to save money, Mr. Hughes said. But, he added, the losses expected are not attributable to any state policies that have made New Jersey less hospitable.

HEADLINE: Study Reveals Harsh Life for Homeless Youth in New York

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
Many homeless youths in New York City are victims of abuse who grew up in foster care or other institutions and now lack jobs, a high school education, birth certificates and adequate health care, according to a study to be released on Tuesday. 
 And the study, one of the largest-ever examinations of young homeless people in New York, found that their future did not look much better -- because they are dangerously isolated from mainstream channels of work, family life and basic schooling. 
 The study, conducted by Covenant House, which operates shelters for young people, examined 444 people between the ages of 18 and 21 who entered the Covenant House Crisis Center between October 2007 and February 2008.
 Forty-seven percent of the group said they had been disciplined physically before entering the shelter, 37 percent said they had been victims of physical abuse, and 19 percent had endured sexual abuse. Forty-one percent said they had witnessed violence in their homes. 
 The vast majority said they found it difficult or impossible to find a good job. Seventy-eight percent said they were unemployed when they entered the shelter. Among those who had jobs, 41 percent said those jobs were ''off the books.''
 Kevin M. Ryan, the president of Covenant House, a privately financed agency with facilities in 20 cities nationwide, including Philadelphia, Detroit, Newark and St. Louis, said he hoped the study alerted the public ''to the growing crisis of homeless youth in New York City.'' 
 ''It is a wake-up call to all of us that we have to be incredibly vigilant on behalf of our kids,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''Especially in a time of economic crisis, when families are feeling stress and strain that, in many instances, can cause kids to become even more disconnected from school and work and family.''
 Adding to the urgency, Mr. Ryan said, was the recent discovery that the number of young homeless people seeking shelter at Covenant House had increased by one-third in the past year. 
 In 2007, a study by the Empire State Coalition of Youth and Family Services, an advocacy group in New York, found that on any given night, roughly 3,800 homeless young people were on the street in New York. 
 Severe cuts in the state budget are threatening the financing for many programs for runaways and homeless youths across the state, said Margo Hirsch, the executive director of the Empire State Coalition. ''Every single one of these programs is going to be affected,'' Ms. Hirsch said. 
 Carol L. M. Caton, a professor of clinical public health at Columbia University and the director of the Columbia Center for Homelessness Prevention Studies, which helped sponsor the 2009 study, said the report exposed at least three major areas that were ripe for further research. They are family relationships, and the events within families that might force a young person out; the impact of institutional experiences like foster care placement; and the challenge of connecting youths to the work force, she said.
 ''They're just on the cusp of adulthood,'' Dr. Caton said. ''And we want to help them transition to adulthood in a way that is positive, so that they won't go on and continue to have some of these bruising experiences.'' 
 Nearly half of the youths who participated in the 2009 study said they had been arrested, 15 percent had been convicted, and 4 percent were on probation or parole. Twenty-nine percent said they drank alcohol, 20 percent reported using marijuana on a regular basis, and 36 percent said someone in their family used drugs regularly.
 Mr. Ryan said he was concerned that after leaving the shelter, where youths typically stay for just under three months, they would enter the adult homeless system, which can be harsh for teenagers -- or even worse, they could ''slide into gang affiliation, drugs and despair.''

HEADLINE: Swiss Re's Chairman Steps Down

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: BERN, Switzerland 

 BODY:
The Swiss Reinsurance Company, which lost more than $800 million last year, said on Monday that its chairman was stepping down, the second executive to leave the company in the last two months. 
 Swiss Re said the chairman, Peter Forstmoser, will step down May 1. Walter B. Kielholz, the head of the board at the Credit Suisse banking group, will succeed him.
 The resignation of Mr. Forstmoser comes after that of the chief executive, Jacques Aigrain, who stepped down last month after he came under increasing pressure for aggressive investments in financial instruments that had gone bad.
 Criticism of Mr. Forstmoser grew when Swiss Re, one of the world's largest reinsurers, posted an 864 million Swiss franc ($809 million) loss for 2008. Hit by the global financial crisis, Swiss Re has lost millions as a result of investments in securities backed by subprime mortgages in the United States and other securities as well as by exposure to the American International Group and the failed investment bank Lehman Brothers.
 The company announced last month it would get a capital injection of 3 billion francs ($2.6 billion) from Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and said it was looking for an additional 2 billion francs on the capital markets.
 ''Swiss Re has set a new course for its future development,'' Mr. Forstmoser said in a statement. ''Therefore I have taken the decision to step down from my position as the chairman of the board one year earlier than planned.'' Mr. Forstmoser has been chairman since 2000.
 Credit Suisse said its vice chairman, Hans-Ulrich Doerig, will become its chairman when Mr. Kielholz leaves.

HEADLINE: Dow Chemical and Rohm Settle a Dispute Over Merger

BYLINE: By ZACHERY KOUWE

 BODY:
After a drawn-out battle in the courts and the severe contraction in the economy, the Dow Chemical Company and Rohm & Haas finally reached a deal on Monday to settle their disputed $15.3 billion merger.
 The two chemical companies were expected to begin trial in Delaware Chancery Court on Tuesday, but agreed to settle out of court after talks last weekend. 
 Under the terms of the settlement, Dow will pay Rohm's shareholders $78 a share in cash and will close the merger by April 1. The settlement is a victory for investors in Rohm, who watched their shares skyrocket 40 percent over the last two trading days as a resolution to the contested deal appeared more likely. 
 Dow first made an offer to buy Rohm & Haas, a specialty chemical maker, in July at the same price of $78 a share. But since then, the economy has slumped, and demand for chemicals has declined along with it. In addition, Dow's joint venture with a Kuwait-owned company fell through in December, erasing a $9 billion cash infusion that was going to help finance the transaction.
 Andrew N. Liveris, Dow's chief executive, sought to delay or renegotiate the terms of the merger with Rohm, arguing that a deal would be financially disastrous for both companies. But Rohm sued the company for breaching the contract and asked a Delaware judge to force Dow to go through with the deal.
 The first step toward a settlement came on Friday when Dow said that it had renegotiated the terms of a bank bridge loan to give it additional financial flexibility.
 Under the new deal, Rohm's two largest shareholders -- the founding Haas family and the hedge fund Paulson & Company -- have agreed to buy up to $2.5 billion in preferred stock in Dow as part of the deal. The company also has an option to solicit another $500 million in common stock from the two shareholders if they need it to cushion their debt load. 
 Dow will pay interest of 15 percent to the two largest shareholders instead of taking on additional debt. The company hopes the addition of equity capital along with about $4.1 billion in near-term asset sales will be enough to maintain their investment-grade credit rating. 
 The company will also pay a fee of about 99 cents a share to Rohm's shareholders for failing to close the takeover by the original January deadline.
 Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren E. Buffett, and the Kuwaiti Investment Authority have already agreed to make a combined $4 billion convertible preferred stock investment in Dow after the deal closes. 
 Dow is also in talks with potential buyers of several business units, including the Morton Salt division of Rohm, which are expected to yield total proceeds of about $4.1 billion. 
 Dow has been in discussions to sell its agricultural chemicals business, which analysts have said could fetch $7 billion, but Mr. Liveris has indicated that he would rather keep the business than sell it in the current market.
 Under the new terms, Dow will have an additional year to pay off the bank bridge loan, and the amount has been reduced by $500 million, to $12.5 billion. The company was also able to adjust some covenants of the loan, which would give it the ability to rework some of the terms if its business continues to deteriorate. 
 The deal represents a big risk for Mr. Liveris, who now has to cut costs and sell assets amid the global financial crisis while operating under a heavy debt burden, analysts say. Dow plans to cut an additional 3,500 job cuts after the merger and will close 10 to 15 plants.
 Investors pushed shares of Dow down about 11 percent on Monday, to $6.33 on worries about the company's outlook after it acquires Rohm.
 ''We question the sustainability of Dow's investment-grade credit rating and its dividend given cyclical weakness and the potential need to refinance a bridge loan,'' Kevin W. McCarthy, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, wrote in a research note on Monday. 
 The deal has already been approved by antitrust regulators and shareholders.

HEADLINE: Leery of Debt, Germany Shuns a Spending Spree

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY and JUDY DEMPSEY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Germany may have to be at the heart of any European response to the weakening world economy, but Germany's heart is not in it.
 World leaders are gearing up for their April 2 summit conference, where they are supposed to settle on a coordinated response to the global slowdown. 
 ''The German approach is going to be 'let's wait on what we have already done,' '' said Peter Bofinger, a professor of economics at the University of Wurzburg. 
 Berlin has already spent 50 billion euros, ($63 billion). But the economic crisis has had few palpable effects on ordinary Germans so far. This, along with a deep-seated mistrust of debt, appears to be reinforcing the government's opposition to spending more now, lest it stoke inflation, analysts said. 
 Germany comes honestly by what some see as its heightened fear of inflation. 
 Savings were wiped out by policies that created hyperinflation in the 1920s and led to disaffection that helped pave the way for the rise of the Nazi party. 
 Since World War II, German economic policy, across party lines, has been about assuring stability -- even if that means accepting slower growth or higher unemployment. 
 As the United States pushes governments around the world to spend more to replace the demand lost from declining American consumption, Chancellor Angela Merkel's main argument is that heavy debt could be a drag on the Continent's economy far into the future. 
 At the same time, Germans warn, a bailout would keep more profligate countries -- Greece, Italy and Spain are often mentioned -- from making the hard choices that brought the German budget nearly into balance before the crisis.
 ''We did our homework,'' said Kurt Lauk, chairman of the economic council in Ms. Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats party.
 On its face, Germany looks hard hit by the crisis. The government expects the economy to contract by 2.25 percent in 2009, its worst slump since the end of World War II.
 Dig a little deeper, though, and the situation, to Germans anyway, looks less dire. German unemployment has barely risen, thanks to manufacturers' orders and recent changes that made labor laws a bit more supple. In February, unemployment rose slightly to 7.9 percent, which is considered not bad for Europe.
 With prices for energy and food declining, the mood among German consumers has remained upbeat. 
 ''The Germans have an economic crisis,'' said Wolfgang Twardawa, a consumer analyst at the research firm GfK, ''but they don't have a financial crisis, and they certainly don't have a property crisis.'' 
 Mr. Twardawa said he believed the German government would end up passing another stimulus plan, but only after national elections in September.
 Before then Mrs. Merkel is loath to go on a spending spree; the Free Democrats, an opposition party which she hopes to lure into a conservative coalition after the election, would accuse her of trying to buy votes.
 Then there is the pressure from inside her own party, which is uneasy with bailouts and heavy spending. Some of its regional political leaders broke their silence over the last few days, criticizing Mrs. Merkel.
 Mrs. Merkel plans to huddle with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France on Thursday to formulate a European negotiating position for the upcoming meeting. The next day, she will retreat to the English countryside to meet with Gordon Brown, the prime minister of Britain.
 When Germany tried to put hedge fund regulation on the agenda two years ago, Britain sided with the administration of George W. Bush in opposing the idea. But two weeks ago at a meeting in Berlin, Mr. Brown lined up alongside Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy in demanding close regulation of the financial sector.
 ''These reforms, which I have been calling for some time and before the global meltdown, are crucial,'' Mrs. Merkel said. ''It is about introducing transparency into the system.''

HEADLINE: Trade Nominee Stresses Rules Over Deals

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The former mayor of Dallas, Ron Kirk, apparently on course to be the next United States trade representative, told senators on Monday that his main objective as the nation's top trade official would be enforcing existing law and insisting that America's trade partners follow the rules. 
 He made clear that trade policy under President Obama would differ from that of the Bush administration, when the emphasis was on cementing new free trade agreements.
 Mr. Kirk, generally supported by the business community as an advocate of expanded trade, said he did not come to the job with ''deal fever'' and would make his top priority assuring that existing trade partners live up to the rules in areas like labor rights and environmental protection that are already on the books.
 He said that of the three pending bilateral free trade deals -- with Panama, Colombia and South Korea -- Panama was the closest to being sent to Congress. The agreement with South Korea, he said, offered ''one of the biggest opportunities we have'' to expand sales abroad, but that the current accord ''just simply isn't fair.''The administration ''will step away from that if we don't get it right,'' he added.
 Revelations that Mr. Kirk, like several other Obama administration nominees, had tax payment problems were barely mentioned in the abbreviated confirmation hearing of the Senate Finance Committee.
 Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the committee's chairman, noted that Kirk had made ''regrettable, but I believe, honest mistakes,'' and added that the nominee had taken steps to remedy them. A confirmation hearing scheduled last week was postponed after the committee revealed that Kirk had underpaid the I.R.S. by roughly $10,000 earlier in the decade.
 ''I believe that you are the best man for the job,'' Mr. Baucus said. Republicans on the committee did not raise the tax issue and none voiced opposition to Mr. Kirk's nomination. The hearing was shorted so senators could leave for a series of votes on the Senate floor. 
 Mr. Baucus, a supporter of free trade, said that with the world economy in shambles and protectionist sentiments growing, Mr. Kirk would face pressure to oppose new trade deals.
 ''Your job will be to fight a rear-guard action to combat new barriers to trade,'' he said. 
 Mr. Kirk also assured senators that any efforts to strengthen the North American Free Trade Agreement would be collaborative and would not result in any of the participants raising tariffs.

HEADLINE: To Halt Slide, Apply Debt Or Control?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When the leaders of 20 nations met in Washington in November to face down a grave economic crisis that imperiled them all, the air was filled with promises of a new era of global regulation intended to match a new era of global risk. 
 Nearly five months later, those risks look greater than ever. But it is a measure of the growing strains over how to manage the global contagion -- for which much of the world primarily blames the United States -- that the world's major and emerging economic powers cannot agree on whether redoing a system created in 1944 should be Job 1. 
 In recent days, the White House has begun signaling that when leaders of the Group of 20 nations meet in London next month, the most pressing issue should be doing more to stimulate their economies through tax and spending policies -- something that Mr. Obama can assert that he has already accomplished. 
 The major European nations, divided among themselves over the wisdom of taking on more debt to combat the global downturn, remain more interested in focusing on a new approach to financial regulation, the issue that they say sits at the heart of the crisis.
 At its simplest, this is a philosophical divide about the European preference for more control over markets, even to the point of creating international regulators who can reach across national borders, and an American fear of gradually diminishing sovereignty over its own institutions. 
 But it is also a test for Mr. Obama. He is at once batting away conservatives who claim that he is shifting the United States too far to the left and allies who fear that for all his talk about practical solutions, he mostly wants to goad them into spending more to save the fragile nations of Eastern Europe.
 It is too early to know whether all this will be papered over as the Europeans prepare for Mr. Obama to arrive in Europe for the first time since, as a candidate, he drew cheering throngs of hundreds of thousands into the streets of Berlin. 
 The mood in Germany in particular is souring; Chancellor Angela Merkel talks about using the moment to enact what she calls ''crucial'' reforms. At the same time the Germans say their modest stimulus package, about 50 billion euros, or $63 billion, less than a tenth of what Congress passed last month to help the United States economy, is quite enough for now. 
 The French seem to be siding with the Germans, and so do the Japanese, who are so debt-laden that they do not want to run up even bigger deficits. Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, appears to be leaning toward Mr. Obama's position that governments ought to spend first and regulate later.
 ''There ought to be some low-hanging fruit we can all agree on,'' Senator John Kerry, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Monday. He spoke after a week of consulting with foreign leaders and hearing European complaints that the Americans started this and now are less interested in creating the rules to prevent a repetition.
 For his part, on Friday, Mr. Obama told The New York Times that ''part of what you're seeing now is weaknesses in Europe that are actually greater than some of the weaknesses here, bouncing back and having an impact on our markets.''
 Inside the White House, officials insist that this is a difference of emphasis, not of fundamental approach. They see no threat to the love-fest between Mr. Obama and the Europeans who celebrated the departure of President George W. Bush two months ago. 
 Yes, officials concede, they have been overwhelmed by the succession of crises that have hit at once: The rapid disintegration of banks that required more capital injections, an auto industry bailout that many inside the administration suspect may be too late to save General Motors, and the accelerating market downturn.
 But they insist that after urging coordinated spending sprees, coming up with a plan for Eastern Europe and other vulnerable economies, and beating down protectionist-sounding legislation that has cropped up around Europe, reforming the global regulatory system is next on the to-do list. 
 ''There will be fairly detailed recommendations and principles coming out of the working groups'' at the April summit meeting, one senior official who has been deeply involved in that process said on Monday. Among them, others said, were likely to be new rules to limit off-shore banking operations, and discussions about how much hedge funds and private equity groups must open their operations to public examination. 
 Investors have heard similar promises before. In the aftermath of the Asian economic crisis of the late 1990s, the Clinton administration pressed a series of measures through the Group of 7 industrial nations, arguing that many elements of the collapse of Asian markets could have been avoided had regulators been more experienced, corruption less rampant, and risks more transparent. But the enthusiasm quickly waned, and by the time Mr. Bush took over, those meetings became much more about terrorism than about setting common rules for the global economy.
 This time could be different: The downturn is much sharper, its effects much more broadly felt. But the divide over how to regulate markets is deep. The United States and Britain, the world's two biggest financial centers, will almost reflexively resist efforts to subject themselves to global regulators. 
 One European ambassador said last weekend that ''in three weeks we'll see whether the love affair with Mr. Obama can withstand our demand that the Untied States clean up its system fast, and his demand that we contribute more to Afghanistan, even faster.''

HEADLINE: President's Task Force Takes a Close Look at G.M. and Chrysler Plants

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Members of President Obama's auto task force visited General Motors and Chrysler on Monday to see firsthand the companies whose fates rest in their hands. 
 Top advisers on the task force, like Steven Rattner and Ron Bloom, toured G.M. and Chrysler plants in Warren, Mich., including a Chrysler factory that builds Dodge Ram pickups. They also drove prototypes of G.M.'s new extended-range electric car, the Chevrolet Volt.
 The auto executives and workers can only hope they made a favorable impression, as the task force enters a critical phase for deciding how, and whether, to rescue the two automakers. 
 The task force members told G.M. and Chrysler executives and leaders of the United Automobile Workers union that Mr. Obama was aware of the urgency of Detroit's problems and was committed to supporting the industry, said an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. 
 However, the official also said that the president saw the need for a fundamental reorganization of G.M. and Chrysler, without specifying how that would be accomplished.
 At issue is whether the government extends up to $21.6 billion in additional loans to G.M. and Chrysler, or arranges federally financed bankruptcies for the companies.
 The government has set a March 31 deadline to decide whether to provide more aid to the automakers.
 By then, G.M. will have exhausted the $13.4 billion in federal loans it has already received. Chrysler is also on the brink of using all of its $4 billion federal loan.
 ''They don't have the luxury of time because these companies are deteriorating before our eyes,'' said John A. Casesa, whose consulting business, the Casesa Shapiro Group, advises the auto industry. The task force's visit drew intense interest in the Detroit area.
 Helicopters from local televisions stations hovered over the G.M. Technical Center to catch a glimpse of Mr. Rattner and Mr. Bloom, two former investment bankers, as they drove the Chevy Volt around the grounds of the sprawling complex.
 A front-page headline in The Detroit Free Press conveyed the desperation of the city. ''Hear Us Out,'' it said. ''We're in Crisis.'' 
 The companies provided few details of the meetings. A Chrysler spokeswoman, Lori McTavish, said the task force had met with the company's chairman, Robert L. Nardelli, and reviewed several products it is planning.
 ''We were pleased to host the task force so they could experience firsthand the new products and technologies that are integral parts of G.M.'s near- and long-term competitiveness,'' G.M. said in a statement.
 The group -- which included two officials from the National Economic Council, Diana Farrell and Brian Deese -- also met with Ron Gettelfinger, president of the U.A.W. 
 Mr. Obama formed the task force last month to assess broad reorganization plans submitted by G.M. and Chrysler as a condition of their federal loans.
 The panel, led by Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and Lawrence H. Summers, director of the National Economic Council, is weighing whether to provide more loans, or require the companies to reorganize in bankruptcy.
 The task force has held a number of meetings not only with G.M. and Chrysler executives, but also with dealers, suppliers, bondholders and a variety of industry specialists.
 One auto analyst who met with the group last week said its members were studying long-term industry trends as well as specific problems facing G.M. and Chrysler.
 ''You can't learn everything in six weeks, but they're sure giving it a shot,'' said the analyst, Sean McAlinden, chief economist with the Center for Automotive Research. ''This will be an informed decision.''
 The leader of the National Auto Dealers Association, John McEleney, met with the task force for 90 minutes last Friday.
 ''We didn't spend much time on the bankruptcy discussion at all,'' said Mr. McEleney, who owns two dealerships in Iowa, that sell multiple brands, including G.M. ''And hopefully that won't be something we'll have to talk about.''
 The government has ordered G.M. and Chrysler to reduce their unsecured debt by two-thirds, and to convince the union to take stock to finance at least 50 percent of a new health care trust for retired workers.
 Those talks are continuing, people with knowledge of the discussions said.
 The third Detroit automaker, the Ford Motor Company, has not asked for government loans. However, Ford reached an agreement with U.A.W. on financing for its health care trust, and last week made offers to bondholders to substantially reduce its debt.
 On Monday, the U.A.W. announced that its members at Ford had approved the agreement that allows the company to finance the trust with a combination of cash and stock.

HEADLINE: The Problem That Isn't Going Away

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Inflection Is Near?'' (column, March 8):
 Thomas L. Friedman is to be commended for asking a ''radical question'': Does the mantra of endless economic growth make sense on a planet whose biological and geological resources are being rapidly depleted?
 The question, of course, is a rhetorical one; even the most brilliant economist cannot design an economic system that can function without water, trees and pollinators, not to mention metals and fossil fuels. Nor can we expect the ecosystems that support us to remain intact in the face of runaway climate change. 
 Recognition of the need for renewable sources of energy has, at long last, dawned. But our reckless consumption of throwaway goods goes unchecked, even amid talk of the renewal of thrift inspired by the economic crisis.
 What passes for thrift in the typical American household would be considered unfathomably luxurious by most of the world's more than 6.5 billion inhabitants. Let's stop pretending that we can continue living unsustainably here in the United States, much less bring the rest of humanity along for the very short duration of this joy ride.
 Erica Etelson Berkeley, Calif., March 8, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I believe that Thomas L. Friedman and the experts he cites in his analysis of our ever-deepening economic quagmire are correct: over the last 50 years we have built a Rube Goldberg contraption that, while a thing of beauty while it lasted, simply could no longer sustain itself.
 As our consumption galloped and our profligacy proliferated, we drew too close to the sun of reality and, like Icarus, are feeling the heat and paying the price. 
 The critical question we must confront is what will rise from the ashes of the 2008 collapse. If the economy to emerge relies on greed and financial egos devoid of regulation, we will have learned nothing. 
 Paul Bloustein Cincinnati, March 8, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''When Jobs Go Missing'' (editorial, March 7):
 In addition to needed training and retraining of unemployed workers, I urge corporate leaders, health care and business owners to invest in training and retraining their own executives and managers. 
 Financial woes notwithstanding, the malaise that ails General Motors ails all organizations, employees and customers alike. Behaviors desperately need to change. Executives must create and lead a customer-focused, accountable and employee-engaged organization. 
 Given eight years of self-aggrandizement and lack of investment in human capital, organizations were already in turmoil. Visionary executives must transform management immediately. Otherwise, they will be unlikely to have the leadership tools to reinvent themselves, avoid more layoffs or achieve any viable future growth.
 Elaine Berke Westport, Mass., March 7, 2009
 The writer heads a leadership and customer experience consulting company.
 To the Editor:
 ''Quiet Layoffs Sting Workers Without Notice'' (front page, March 6) described only a couple of examples of businesses laying off workers. I feel this will become a larger problem in the future in many different businesses. 
 President Obama has stated that the economy will need to get worse before it can get better. I believe that many businesses will lay off quietly because they do not want to get a bad reputation. This could be a good thing when the companies need to hire more workers. 
 Businesses in small towns all around are quietly letting many employees go. The WARN Act, requiring 60 days' notice, is a good way to establish some ground rules so that layoffs are fair to everyone. There is as of now not one nationally set amount of time given to an employee being laid off. 
 Allison Adams Boone, N.C., March 6, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I appreciated ''Two Americas, Two Tax Codes,'' by Dorothy Brown (Op-Ed, March 9), and I agree that what she describes is not fair to the individual taxpayer. 
 But the tax code is not intended to be fair. It is intended to carry out policy. It is designed to encourage or discourage certain behaviors. 
 Raise the capital gains tax, and less money will be invested and fewer jobs created. Increase the deduction for charitable contributions, and more money goes to the charities. And on it goes. The question of fairness is secondary. 
 And, I reluctantly have to say, it should be if policy is for the greater good of the people.
 John Brandte Deerfield, N.H., March 9, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Generation OMG'' (Week in Review, March 8): As an 18-year-old member of the generation in question, I find it hard to fathom that a majority of my peers will grow up to become ''docile notetakers,'' byproducts of our ''neuroses'' or benign careerists content to ''marry younger'' and ''be satisfied with stable but less exciting jobs.''
 Young Americans have become genuinely disillusioned. Judging from the conversations I have had with my friends and classmates, the recession has strengthened our desire to end corporate corruption, reform the regulation of the financial markets and above all, to contribute with honesty to the nation's welfare.
 What is clear to many of us is that this time, docility and passivity -- making the best of a bad situation -- aren't good enough. Young people want to work to learn from the disastrous mistakes of our parents' generation. As we have all learned so powerfully in the last few months, the cost of the alternatives -- inaction and self-absorption -- is simply too great.
 Peter W. Fulham North Redington Beach, Fla. March 8, 2009
 To the Editor:
 There is a juggling and bantering of dire economic terms in the media, a debate even about whether we are in a severe recession or a real depression or a recession on the way to depression. As usual, at some point, an attempt at broad strokes forgets the reality and relativity of specific situations. 
 Everyone should be aware and understand with the utmost gravity that regardless of the apparent buoyancy of our individual circumstances, there are millions of Americans who are currently living in a real economic depression, and they are growing by staggering numbers every day.

HEADLINE: Corzine, Tough Sell for 3 Years, Works to Connect With Voters

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J. 

 BODY:
As Gov. Jon S. Corzine ambled down Washington Street during the St. Patrick's Day parade here on Saturday, hundreds of people greeted him by waving, barking his name or asking him to pose for photos. But once Mr. Corzine passed by, some of those same people began blurting out the kinds of things that one might use to describe an unpopular neighbor, behind his back.
 ''You're messing up my state!'' yelled one.
 ''Put on your seat belt!'' someone else shouted. 
 ''Hey, is that Codey?'' joked another. ''We want Codey!''
 Three years into the job, Mr. Corzine is still a tough sell or an acquired taste to many New Jersey residents, even in a Democratic stronghold like Hoboken, the place he now calls home. And as his poll numbers deteriorate, with an increasing plurality of people unhappy with his job performance, there is no shortage of people blaming Mr. Corzine for the state's fiscal woes, singling out his 2007 car accident as the defining event of his tenure, or pining for a more popular politician like the State Senate president, Richard J. Codey.
 Mr. Corzine is unlikely to win many new friends on Tuesday, when he is expected to propose a series of difficult steps to help the state close a $7 billion budget deficit: raising income taxes among the wealthiest residents, demanding that state workers agree to a wage freeze and take 12 unpaid days off, and reducing spending by billions. Small wonder, then, that Republicans are optimistic that they can win their first statewide election since 1997; one leading contender, a former United States attorney, Christopher J. Christie, is already ahead in at least two polls. 
 Mr. Corzine, 62, may in part be a casualty of anxieties about the economy, as are elected officials around the country. But what complicates his second-term aspirations is the fact that Mr. Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, has never been particularly popular. His highest approval ratings in Quinnipiac University's poll, 51 percent, came shortly after his car accident, a figure that political analysts now attribute to pity, and Mr. Corzine's public service announcement urging seat belt use.
 Yet now, with the political clock ticking fast against the backdrop of a national recession, Mr. Corzine, a lumbering public speaker, must do something that he has always struggled with: connect with the average resident.
 ''Personally, I like him, but I can't relate to him,'' John DellaFave, a retired police officer from Hoboken, said during Saturday's parade. ''I think it's hard to connect when you're a billionaire. The only thing he's got going for him is he's a Democrat.''
 Mr. Corzine (who is, for the record, just a multimillionaire) knows that he needs to do more to make an impression on voters. Part of the problem, he says, is a dearth of media coverage in New Jersey. But part of the problem, he concedes, is himself, since he is hardly Bill Clinton, Barack Obama or even former Gov. James E. McGreevey when it comes to the gift of feel-your-pain retail politics.
 ''I do get frustrated,'' he said during an interview in his state vehicle Friday as he traveled between a conference on child abuse in East Brunswick and a funeral in Manhattan. ''But I'm not Jim McGreevey. That's got both good and, I presume, it's got some negative elements from the standpoint of pure politics.''
 Mr. Corzine is proud of his record, especially in the areas of health care, children's issues and public safety. And he is confident that, come November, voters will recognize his accomplishments and his attempts to grapple with serious problems.
 But in two recent polls, from Quinnipiac University and Fairleigh Dickinson University, Mr. Corzine recorded job approval ratings of 41 and 40 percent, respectively, while the state was viewed as being on the wrong track by 68 and 59 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, households with public employees -- a group that typically supports Democrats -- disapproved of Mr. Corzine, 56 to 31 percent. 
 That hostility toward Mr. Corzine can be explained, labor officials say, by his frequent criticisms of unions and his clumsy dealings with a prominent labor leader, his former companion Carla Katz, during contract negotiations. And now there is trepidation over his budget. 
 On Tuesday, Mr. Corzine is expected to recommend raising income taxes 5 percent on those earning more than $250,000, at least temporarily, and eliminating property-tax rebates for all but the elderly. He may also increase taxes on cigarettes and alcohol.
 Mr. Corzine's standing is not helped by the fact that his relationship with the Legislature, and many in his own party, has often been distant or frosty. At the same time, his initial aura as a Wall Street wizard has faded considerably.
 ''Corzine came in as a reformer, the guy who's going to fix everything, but I suspect a lot of people are saying, 'Why haven't you fixed it?' '' said Peter J. Woolley, executive director of Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll. ''And now that Wall Street has been tarnished, it's tarnish by association.''
 It has not helped matters much that Mr. Corzine has reinforced the suspicion that he has more of a New York state of mind. After all, his current companion lives on the Upper East Side. He is spotted frequently at restaurants and movie theaters in Manhattan. And he has been photographed several times in the New York Social Diary, and is occasionally mentioned on Page Six of The New York Post.
 ''Instead of seeing him at the beach or picking pumpkins, we see him at charity balls,'' said Brigid Harrison, a professor of political science at Montclair State University. ''And instead of going to the Jersey Shore or Long Beach Island, he'll go to the Hamptons. So people feel, 'He's not one of us.' '' 
 The paradox, even Republicans say, is that the governor is quite down-to-earth and personable in a smaller setting, like a diner. And his passion for social issues seems genuine, as evidenced by his comments on Friday to a conference on child abuse in East Brunswick: ''I'll go to my grave saying this is one of the great accomplishments of my life,'' he said, to sustained applause.
 Yet Mr. Corzine's attempts to raise his public profile have not always succeeded. After all, one of his biggest failures was his attempt in 2007 to refinance the state's toll roads to generate billions of dollars to help the state pay down debt -- an attempt that included an aborted town hall-style tour of the state's counties.
 The trouble was, he was all about PowerPoint, while the audience was all about raw emotion, almost all of it in opposition.
 ''You've got to somehow break through on all these things, and the only time that people saw me break through was actually at the town hall meetings, and we ended up having a less-than-an-overwhelmingly-positive reaction because it was co-opted by the people who were opposed,'' Mr. Corzine said.

HEADLINE: Obama's Budget Faces Challenge By Party Barons

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
What the Democratic barons of Congress liked best about President Obama's audacious budget was his invitation to fill in the details. They have started by erasing some of his. 
 The apparent first casualty is a big one: a proposal to limit tax deductions for the wealthiest 1.2 percent of taxpayers. Mr. Obama says the plan would produce $318 billion over the next decade as a down payment for overhauling health care. 
 But the chairmen of the House and Senate tax-writing committees, Senator Max Baucus of Montana and Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, have objected to the proposal, citing a potential drop in tax-deductible gifts to charities. 
 Billions in savings from cutting government subsidies to big farmers and agribusinesses? No dice, said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, who heads the Senate Budget Committee. 
 Mr. Conrad also panned the limit on tax deductions. And his criticisms of those savings proposals aside, Mr. Conrad said Mr. Obama's 10-year plan would not do enough to reduce future debt.
 Shrink spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security? Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, chairman of the House Budget Committee, suggested Mr. Obama's proposals did not go far enough. 
 Cap industries' emissions of the gases blamed for climate change? Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, will have to contend with dissent on a panel with Democrats from coal and manufacturing states.
 ''The legislative process requires compromise and being open to different alternatives,'' Mr. Waxman said.
 Mr. Obama is taking a gamble in outsourcing the drafting of his agenda's details to these five veteran lawmakers and others in Congress, each with his own political and parochial calculations.
 ''This is not an easy budget to market, for sure,'' Mr. Spratt said.
 He said he and other Democratic leaders would have to sell it one lawmaker at a time, but sell it they would. ''Not every problem is a deal breaker,'' Mr. Spratt said. ''We will try and make corrections and accommodations.''
 The process is like ''a giant jigsaw puzzle,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''But it is going to come together.''
 If the budget is to come together, the responsibility will be on the Democratic committee chairmen to deliver since most Republicans seem to have little appetite for the president's proposals.
 After a $787 billion economic stimulus package and a $410 billion appropriations measure for the current year, ''Republicans feel like they can oppose this spending spree and this shifting of power from Main Street to Washington enthusiastically,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina to whom the administration has looked for bipartisanship. ''It means the year could be an ideological struggle instead of a problem-solving year.''
 The House and Senate are aiming to agree on a budget in April, but it will not require Mr. Obama's signature.
 Instead, that budget serves as a nonbinding blueprint for the committees -- chiefly the Ways and Means and Finance panels -- to write the legislation that Mr. Obama would sign into law. The changes he envisions for health care, energy, taxes, education, transportation and more have stymied Congress for years; in his budget, they come packaged together, and the resistance will be multiplied as a result.
 The White House, meanwhile, is making clear that it is ready to push back, judging by its reaction to the strong resistance to its proposal to limit wealthy taxpayers' deductions.
 When Mr. Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, soon after the Obama budget's release that the administration must find a more ''viable'' source of revenue for its health care plan, Mr. Geithner expressed openness to other options. 
 The next day, however, Mr. Geithner staunchly defended the proposed limit, telling the House Budget Committee it would affect few taxpayers and still let them take deductions at the same level as in the Reagan years: a 28 percent rate, nearly twice what most taxpayers can claim.
 The White House has sought to broaden that defense, emphasizing that the impact on charitable giving is likely to be small and that the proposal is hardly radical. Mr. Geithner has called it ''fair and reasonable.''
 Mr. Baucus, a veteran of 34 years in Congress, has welcomed Mr. Obama's determination to overhaul health care this year. But he also has been drafting his own plan to contain costs and expand insurance coverage, putting him in potential conflict not only with the White House, but also with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the Senate health committee.
 For instance, Mr. Baucus has suggested that one way to raise money would be to tax as income the value of the health insurance some employees get on the job, an approach Mr. Obama attacked when Senator John McCain, his Republican rival for the presidency last fall, proposed it.
 For Mr. Conrad and some other Democrats, the political problem is that the upfront costs of health care reforms are huge while the promised cost savings are years in the future. 
 ''When people say we won't see the results of any of that spending for 10 years, I become skeptical,'' Mr. Conrad said.
 Early meetings of representatives of his Budget Committee and the Senate's finance and health committees, Mr. Conrad said, have made for ''very lively debates.'' 
 As difficult as addressing health care will be, the energy issue may prove even more contentious and from the perspective of many lawmakers is the element of the administration's agenda most likely to be set aside temporarily if a major initiative must be sacrificed to push through other programs. 
 To spur development of alternative energy, reduce dependence on foreign oil and help arrest climate change, Mr. Obama proposes a cap-and-trade system after 2011 that would require polluting industries to buy permits to emit carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. Because companies would pass on the costs to customers, most of the revenues from auctioning permits would go to payments to low-wage and middle-income workers to offset their higher utility bills and other expenses. The rest would pay for alternative energy programs.
 Republicans are already digging in against Mr. Obama's approach, opposing both mandates that businesses buy pollution permits, and the idea of tax refunds to workers who earn too little to pay income taxes.
 Democrats have their own divisions on energy legislation. Further complicating matters is the fact that Mr. Rangel, who will have to share responsibility for health care with Mr. Waxman, wants his panel to have a piece of the energy policy fight as well. Both men say they can resolve such territorial disputes.
 ''We are going to have to work out whatever issues there are,'' Mr. Waxman said.

HEADLINE: Hold on! What's Wrong With a Little More Egalite?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''One France Is Enough,'' by Roger Cohen (column, The New York Times on the Web, March 5):
 I would love to read something other than schadenfreude for European societies. The European model is often invoked by American commentators and politicians as the ultimate bogyman. The formulation is usually the same: America is doing badly, but at least we're not Europe! 
 What makes the European way of life so unpalatable to American eyes?
 Perhaps one day I will read a column defending the exemplary policies pioneered in Europe -- like universal health care and, yes, a decent safety net for workers in need of assistance between jobs. 
 It is all too easy to criticize ''welfare queens,'' as Ronald Reagan did decades ago. But would it not be right to defend policies that help the average, hard-working individual laid low by the cupidity of bankers?
 At this time of weakness -- with America currently faring worse than France in this recession -- would it hurt my fellow Americans so much to find inspiration in another society's example?
 Rene C. Moya London, March 6, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Roger Cohen characterizes President Obama's economic efforts as ''a touch of France.'' He could as easily -- and as accurately -- have called Mr. Obama's policies ''a touch of Sweden,'' ''a touch of Britain'' or, indeed, ''a touch of Canada,'' since all these countries and more use socialist programs to meet their countries' needs. 
 Even if France were the only socialist-leaning country in the world, we could do worse than learn a thing or two from France. After all, wasn't it France that warned us not to invade Iraq? Imagine how un-French our economic situation would be right now had we heeded that advice!
 Mike Lambert Studio City, Calif., March 6, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Were our health care to become more like that of France, it would be a tremendous success. 
 The French spend only two-thirds of what we spend on health care, yet they have the system that the World Health Organization has rated the best in the world and still drink more red wine, smoke more heavily and, yes, eat more cheese than Americans.

HEADLINE: Friendship Born at Harvard Goes On to White House

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
At Harvard Law School, they supported student demands for more professors of color, savored countless episodes of ''The Cosby Show'' and ''L.A. Law,'' and dreamed about how two idealistic black women might make their mark. Their legal careers took them to separate cities, but they never lost touch. 
 Jocelyn Frye became a passionate proponent of affirmative action and workplace equity and an advocate for women and families in Washington. Michelle Obama became a community organizer and a hospital executive committed to eliminating health care barriers for the poor in Chicago. 
 Two decades later, the old friends are back together, this time in the White House. Ms. Frye is now the first lady's policy and projects director, helping Mrs. Obama develop a policy platform and a presence in this city.
 Mrs. Obama, of course, dominates the spotlight. But Ms. Frye has emerged as an influential, behind-the-scenes adviser, helping to hone Mrs. Obama's emerging policy agenda even as she also counsels the president on some domestic policy matters. (Ms. Frye, who also works for President Obama's domestic policy team, was granted a waiver to work for the administration despite rules that ban the employment of lobbyists.)
 An advocate steeped in contentious workplace issues might not seem like a natural choice for a first lady who is trying to steer clear of controversy. Ms. Frye's supporters and adversaries, though, describe her as pointed, but soft-spoken; passionate, but rarely partisan, with a knack for defusing the rancor around hot-button issues. 
 She is married to a Republican political consultant, Brian Summers, who campaigned for former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas in the Republican presidential primary race. (''We don't talk much about politics,'' said Ms. Frye, who is 45 and a Democrat. ''Nothing good could come of it.'') 
 And she and Mrs. Obama share a passion for policies that affect women and families, and an easy camaraderie born of many late-night, heart-to-heart talks at Harvard. In law school, ''they could almost finish each other sentences,'' said Charles J. Ogletree Jr., a Harvard law professor and mentor to Ms. Frye and Mrs. Obama. 
 ''You'll see Michelle Obama's face on the issues,'' Professor Ogletree said, ''but you better believe that the commitment behind it also comes from Jocelyn Frye by her side.''
 Ms. Frye's fingerprints are already visible on the first lady's fledgling policy initiatives. 
 She helped Lilly Ledbetter prepare a speech for the first lady's first public event -- a White House reception that celebrated the enactment of a pay-equity law. (The law was named after Ms. Ledbetter, a supervisor at a Goodyear tire plant in Alabama, who for decades was paid less than her male counterparts.)
 Ms. Frye identified some of the community institutions here visited by Mrs. Obama -- Mary's Center, a health clinic that serves immigrants; Howard University, a historic black college; and Miriam's Kitchen, a nonprofit group that feeds the homeless. (A native Washingtonian, Ms. Frye has taken the lead in helping the Obamas integrate themselves into this city.)
 She has also supported Mrs. Obama's decision to promote the president's legislative agenda, which raised some eyebrows since most first ladies have avoided discussing legislation. 
 Administration officials say the first lady will soon focus on the Serve America Act, a bipartisan bill in the Senate that would expand the number of public service volunteers eligible for minimal living expenses and modest educational stipends.
 Melody C. Barnes, who directs the president's Domestic Policy Council, described Ms. Frye's work as crucial. ''As we think about policy and legislation, she is a part of that conversation, thinking about ways the first lady's work can be calibrated to support those efforts,'' Ms. Barnes said. 
 Ms. Frye, who attended Mr. and Mrs. Obama's wedding, never imagined that she might follow her friend into the Executive Mansion. She is the daughter of government workers -- her mother worked for the Library of Congress and her father worked for military intelligence -- who sacrificed to send her to private schools. She still lives in the predominantly black neighborhood where she grew up, just walking distance from the house she lived in as a girl.
 She has been challenging authority on issues of gender and race since her days at Harvard, when she and others took over the dean's office to draw attention to the lack of faculty diversity. Being part of government after so many years of challenging it will not be easy, some predicted. 
 But Verna Williams, who attended Harvard with Ms. Frye and Mrs. Obama, said Ms. Frye would be a truth-teller in the White House, someone who would never be so awed by her new perch that she would hesitate to speak her mind.
 ''You can't get so caught up in this that you lose sight of real people and real problems,'' said Ms. Frye, who described her first month in the White House as ''a whirlwind.''
 Indeed, a speech that Ms. Frye delivered last month suggested that she and the first lady might find a way to embrace some of her old causes by adopting the neutral, inclusive language Ms. Frye is known for. 
 At a University of Pittsburgh School of Law conference on the gender wage gap, Ms. Frye argued that the push to eliminate pay differences between men and women should no longer be viewed as controversial. Instead, she said, the effort should be considered an economic priority for struggling families, particularly as growing numbers of women become primary breadwinners with layoffs decimating industries dominated by men. 
 Ms. Frye was echoing a theme -- linking pay equity to the economic wellbeing of families -- that was first raised by her good friend, Mrs. Obama, at the Lilly Ledbetter reception.
 ''It's much more than a gender issue,'' said Ms. Frye, who emphasized she was not speaking for the White House. ''It's really an economic security issue.''

LIBYA FAULTS WASHINGTON
On Halt to Weapons Programs
When Libya gave up its nuclear and chemical weapons programs in late 2003, President George W. Bush pointed to the decision as a victory in Washington's war on terror. Libyan officials now insist that the United States has done little to reward the concessions and undermined its credibility as it presses Iran and North Korea to abandon weapons programs. Libya remains run by an eccentric, enigmatic strongman, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, above. PAGE A6

Four officials of a right-to-die network known as the Final Exit Network were arrested in Georgia last month on charges of racketeering and assisted suicide.

Editorial
MR. OBAMA'S TRADE AGENDA
In tough times, there is a strong temptation to turn inward. With so many Americans already out of work, why shouldn't the country raise trade barriers to protect its workers from foreign competition? The answer is clear: trade will play an important role in the world's eventual recovery, while giving in to protectionism could unleash destructive trade wars. Page A30
NARROWING THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT
The Supreme Court narrowed the scope of the Voting Rights Act this week when it ruled that it does not require states to create so-called crossover districts. The ruling overturns two of the act's central goals: protecting minority voting rights and moving the nation toward a more color-blind future. Page A30
THE DALAI LAMA'S SPEECH
The Dalai Lama is a man of peace and forbearance. So it is a measure of Tibet's suffering that he accused China's government of turning Tibet into ''a hell on earth.'' We only hope Beijing heeds his warnings before it is too late. Without serious negotiations and a political solution, there will only be instability -- just what Beijing's leaders fear. Page A30

In an Op-Ed article, Steven Kleinman and Matthew Alexander, both experienced military interrogators, say that widely employed tactics meant to scare or humiliate a prisoner are not as effective as efforts to gain the person's trust, and they argue that all interrogation methods should be scientifically evaluated to see which ones work best.

HEADLINE: As Jobs Vanish, Motel Rooms Become Home

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: COSTA MESA, Calif. 

 BODY:
Greg Hayworth, 44, graduated from Syracuse University and made a good living in his home state, California, from real estate and mortgage finance. Then that business crashed, and early last year the bank foreclosed on the house his family was renting, forcing their eviction. 
 Now the Hayworths and their three children represent a new face of homelessness in Orange County: formerly middle income, living week to week in a cramped motel room. 
 ''I owe it to my kids to get out of here,'' Mr. Hayworth said, recalling the night they saw a motel neighbor drag a half-naked woman out the door while he beat her. 
 As the recession has deepened, longtime workers who lost their jobs are facing the terror and stigma of homelessness for the first time, including those who have owned or rented for years. Some show up in shelters and on the streets, but others, like the Hayworths, are the hidden homeless -- living doubled up in apartments, in garages or in motels, uncounted in federal homeless data and often receiving little public aid. 
 The Hayworths tried staying with relatives but ended up last September at the Costa Mesa Motor Inn, one of more than 1,000 families estimated to be living in motels in Orange County alone. They are among a lucky few: a charity pays part of the $800-a-month charge while Mr. Hayworth tries to recreate a career. 
 The family, which includes a 15-year-old daughter, shares a single room and sleeps on two beds. With most possessions in storage, they eat in two shifts, on three borrowed plates -- all that one jammed cabinet can hold. His wife, Terri, has health problems and, like many other families, they cannot muster the security deposit and other upfront costs of renting a new place.
 Motel families exist by the hundreds in Denver, along freeway-bypassed Route 1 on the Eastern Seaboard, and in other cities from Chattanooga, Tenn., to Portland, Ore. But they are especially prevalent in Orange County, which has high rents, a shortage of public housing and a surplus of older motels that once housed Disneyland visitors. 
 ''The motels have become the de facto low-income housing of Orange County,'' said Wally Gonzales, director of Project Dignity, one of dozens of small charities and church groups that have emerged to assist families, usually helping a few dozen each and relying on donations of food, clothing and toys.
 In the past, motel families here were mainly drawn from the chronically struggling. In 1998, an expose of neglected motel children by The Orange County Register prompted creation of city task forces and promises of help. But in recent months, schools, churches and charities report a different sort of family showing up.
 ''People asking for help are from a wider demographic range than we've seen in the past, middle-income families,'' said Terry Lowe, director of community services in Anaheim, Calif. The motels range from those with tattered rugs and residents who abuse alcohol and drugs to newer places with playgrounds and kitchenettes. With names like the Covered Wagon Motel and the El Dorado Inn, they look like any other modestly priced stopover inland from the ritzy beach towns. But walk inside and the perception immediately changes. 
 In the evening, the smell of pasta sauce cooked on hot plates drifts through half-open doors; in the morning, children leave to catch school buses. Families of three, six or more are squeezed into a room, one child doing homework on a bed, jostled by another watching television. Children rotate at bedtime, taking their turns on the floor. Some families, like the Malpicas, in a motel in Anaheim, commandeer a closet for baby cribs. 
 The Garza family moved to the Costa Mesa Inn in August, after the husband, Johnny, lost his job at Target, his wife, Tamara, lost her job at Petco, and they were evicted from their two-bedroom rental. Their 9-year-old daughter now shares a bed with two younger brothers, their toys and schoolbooks piled on the floor. The couple's baby boy, born in April, sleeps in a small crib. Rental aid from federal and county programs reaches only a small fraction of needy families, said Bob Cerince, coordinator for homeless and motel residents services in Anaheim, who estimated the families at more than 1,000. 
 President Obama's stimulus package may give hope to more people and blunt the projected rise of families who could end up in motels and shelters, said Nan Roman, president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness in Washington. The package allows $1.5 billion for homeless prevention, including help with rent and security deposits. Schools have made special efforts to help children in displaced families stay in class, and some send social workers to connect families with counseling services and food aid. 
 Wendy Dallin, the liaison for the homeless in one of Anaheim's seven school districts, said that in the last three months she had learned of 38 newly homeless families, bringing the total she knew of in her district to 376. About 48 of those families are living in motels, Ms. Dallin said, with the rest in shelters, renting a room or garage, staying with relatives or living in cars. At the same time, in California's budget crisis, some school social workers are being laid off. 
 By necessity, most cities here have been lax in enforcing occupancy codes. Still, a source of turmoil for motel families is a California rule that after 28 days, residents are considered tenants, gaining legal rights of occupancy. Some motels force families to move every month, while others make families stay in a different room for a day or two. 
 Many motel residents have at least one working parent and pay $800 to $1,200 a month for a room. Yet even those with jobs can become mired in motel life for years because of bad credit ratings and the difficulty of saving the extra months' rent and security deposits to secure an apartment. 
 Paris Andre Navarro, 47, knows how hard it can be to climb back. She and her husband used to have good jobs and an apartment in Garden Grove, near Anaheim. But they have spent the last three years with their 11-year-old daughter in the El Dorado Inn. 
 The bottom fell out when her husband's medical problems forced him to leave his job as a computer technician and her home-care job ended. They were evicted and moved into the motel, and she started working the night shift at Target.
 Last year, when Ms. Navarro's husband started a telemarketing job, they thought they might escape. That hope evaporated when her hours at Target were cut in half. What with the $241 weekly rent, the cost of essentials and a $380 car payment, they cannot save. 
 ''Now we're just living paycheck to paycheck,'' Ms. Navarro said. 
 Their daughter, Crystal, tries to sound stoical. ''What I miss most is having a pet,'' she said. The motel does not allow pets, so she gave away her cat and kittens.
 Greg Hayworth, whose family has spent six dispiriting months in the Costa Mesa Inn, tried working in sales but has had trouble finding a lasting job. Paul Leon, a former nurse who formed the Illumination Foundation to aid motel families, has promised to help with a security deposit when the Hayworths are able to move out. 
 Mr. Hayworth's teenage daughter has had the roughest time because of the lack of privacy. She is too embarrassed to take friends home, and is uncomfortable dressing in front of her brothers, who are 10 and 11. Not long ago, she was attacked at school by classmates who mocked her for living in a motel. 
 ''I'd promised my daughter that we'd be out of here by her birthday,'' Mr. Hayworth said. ''But that came last week, and we're still here.'' 
 ''It really hurt me the other day,'' he added. ''My son came home and asked, 'Are we homeless'? I didn't know what to say.''

HEADLINE: Let the Bidding Begin

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
In honor of the news that Michael Vick's suburban Atlanta mansion went on the auction block today, we present our own sports auction, full of items you might not want -- hip surgery, Facebook posts gone bad, a job coaching the Montreal Canadiens -- and some that might impress your friends. Bid at your own risk. 
 If you wanted Vick's house, typically modest with 11 bathrooms and a four-car garage, you would have had to fork over at least $3.2 million, the minimum bid, and then find a new home for the large No. 7 rug parked in one of its rotundas. Apparently, that was too much to ask and the auction closed with no winner. Oddly, the real estate listing mentions nothing about its former owner. 
 Of course, the Canadiens will be looking for a new occupant for their coaching job, which their general manager, Bob Gainey, is temporarily occupying after axing Coach Guy Carbonneau on Monday. The franchise, whose every twist and turn is agonized over by the most passionate fans in hockey, seems to be stumbling down some unseen staircase that includes players being linked with mobsters, imploding superstars, fading Stanley Cup dreams.
 We would like to auction off hockey's latest horrifying bobblehead doll, but we are guessing that the only bidders will be friends of Carolina's Scott Walker who plan to burn them.
 While you enjoy the latest N.B.A.buzzer-beating heroics by Miami's Dwyane Wade, consider that the off-season swap meet might involve Shaquille O'Neal bolstering LeBron James's title hopes in Cleveland, the trading deadline deal that did not happen but which some think might still come true.
 You could bid for the relatively thankless job of keeping order at Philadelphia Eagles games, but consider first what the Eagles did to the last guy who held the job: firing Dan Leone for a brief, critical Facebook post after the team let Brian Dawkins walk as a free agent.
 Or perhaps you would like a special, autographed copy of the upcoming book by the British sprinter Dwain Chambers, once a banned drug cheat now staging an eyebrow-raising comeback with the help of one Victor Conte.
 Baseball is offering mostly fun, heart-warming stories from the World Baseball Classic, its warm and fuzzy distraction from the Alex Rodriguez saga, now entering its rehab-from-hip-surgery stage. You can contemplate hips, courtesy of the Daily News, or you can move on to happier thoughts of how cool the W.B.C. is for some players without major league riches. Or how Pedro Martinez is using it to keep his career going. Or mourn the demise of Canada's hopes, as if all that Montreal Canadiens business was not depressing enough up there.
 If you would like miserable company in thinking about financial woes, ESPN's Peter Gammons buries a bad baseball economic forecast in a blog post about Jon Lester. Or you can take sides in the debate whether bailed-out banks should be sponsoring golf tournaments. Golfdigest.com, surprisingly, comes out on the side of golf tournaments.
 How is this for financial risk? The Oklahoma basketball player Courtney Paris guarantees the Sooners will win a national title or she will pay back her scholarship. 
 USA Today, however, offers something to bet on with perhaps better odds: golf's next great hope, a teenager from Northern Ireland named Rory McIlroy, who takes his place on the auction block as Tiger Woods's heir apparent.

HEADLINE: He Made Missouri A Chinese Province

BYLINE: By JOHN T. EDGE

DATELINE: Springfield, Mo. 

 BODY:
 STANDING in the parking lot of Mr. Yen's, a 560-seat palace of Chinese cooking owned by a family friend, David Leong scanned the red clay pagoda roof and rose-colored walls and staked a claim that few here in the Ozarks would dispute. 
 ''All this came from my cashew chicken,'' said Mr. Leong, the 88-year-old patriarch of the Chinese food industry here. ''All these restaurants. This wealth. From my family.'' 
 Cashew chicken, in the form first cooked by Mr. Leong nearly a half-century ago, is not the stir-fry served by many Chinese-American restaurants. Around Springfield, cashew chicken -- deep-fried chicken chunks in a brown slurry of soy sauce, oyster sauce and stock, scattered with green onions and halved cashews -- is the culinary common denominator. It's a weeknight dinner, bought from a drive-through. It's a weekday plate lunch, accompanied by fried rice and an egg roll. 
 More than 70 Chinese restaurants in this city of 157,000 serve cashew chicken, from Lucy's Chinese Food, a three-location chain owned by brothers John and Tom Gregoroski, to the Canton Inn, a converted Dunkin' Donuts where Chiwa and Foon Wong keep a pot of chicken stock simmering on the stove and the cashew chicken special costs $3.75. 
 In St. Louis and Kansas City, cashew chicken is served ''Springfield style,'' heralded with provincial categorization like Sichuan or Cantonese. In Springfield, however, cashew chicken accepts no categorization. 
 It's a standard at the Vietnamese restaurant Little Saigon. (The menu includes a section of ''breaded chicken'' dishes.) Golden Korean, a neighboring strip-mall purveyor of bulgogi and kimchi, sells crab Rangoon purses by the half-dozen and cashew sauce by the pint.
 Cashew chicken transcends nationality. At Ziggie's, a diner owned and operated by the Zendelis, a family of Albanian origin, it's a white-board special, served in a skillet-shaped ceramic crock with a roster of side dishes that includes cottage cheese and hash browns. 
 ''It's not necessarily Chinese,'' said Vicki Hilton, a local zoning inspector on lunch break at Ziggie's. ''Our kids eat cashew chicken in their school cafeteria.'' (A number of schools rely on the Hopsing brand of cashew chicken sauce mix, a powdered product made in Springfield, colored with turmeric and goosed with MSG.) 
 The Heritage Cafeteria, a strip-mall dowager that opened in 1960, stocks chicken planks, yellow rice, roasted cashews and a vat of brown gravy alongside haunches of roast beef and tubs of gelatin salad. ''Our sauce is made from chicken base, soy sauce and Clear Jel,'' a thickening agent, said Kulwant Hundal, a native of Punjab, India, who has worked the line for 10 years. ''I love it.'' 
 At Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World, the flagship location in a Springfield-based national chain, Marcel Bonetti is the company's executive chef. ''I brought my recipes to this country,'' said Mr. Bonetti, a native of Aix-en-Provence, France. ''But all I heard was cashew, cashew, cashew. So I made my own version. I added bourbon.'' 
 Some Chinese restaurateurs with fine-dining aspirations try to resist the pull of cashew chicken. They fail. 
 ''We've got dim sum on the weekend,'' said John Burke, 36, proprietor of Mr. Yen's. ''And spicy pigs' ears on the menu. But it doesn't matter -- 40 percent of our business is cashew chicken.'' 
 ''It's not the Chinese cashew chicken you think you know,'' said Mr. Burke, whose family immigrated from Taiwan in 1976. ''It's fried chicken and mashed potatoes with gravy. It's Missouri. Only we sub fried rice for potatoes.'' 
 ''When I took over, I wanted to serve something other than chicken nuggets in brown gravy,'' Mr. Burke continued. ''My father said: 'Are you stupid, son? Are you that stupid? You can't cook Chinese in Springfield without cooking cashew chicken.' '' 
 ''I fought it at first,'' he said. ''Now I eat cashew chicken three or four days a week.'' 
 Kelly Knauer, a native, was eating an order of the same at Fire and Ice, a swank open-kitchen restaurant that once featured a pizza with fried chicken, cashews and mozzarella. ''Cashew chicken is a kind of inside joke in Springfield,'' he said. ''But it's also our daily bread, our defining food. And it starts with David Leong.'' 
 Unlike many dishes of American pop provenance, Springfield cashew chicken comes with a well-curated narrative. Residents here recognize the primacy of Mr. Leong. They embrace the Leong story as a Springfield story. 
 Mr. Leong immigrated to the United States in 1940 from Guangdong, China. He became a naturalized citizen, then served his adopted country during World War II. (During the Normandy invasion, he was in the fourth wave of troops to hit Omaha Beach.) After the war, he bounced from restaurant to restaurant, from Philadelphia to New Orleans to Pensacola, Fla. 
 At Pirate's Cove, a Pensacola restaurant where he honed a reputation for broiled scallops and flounder braised in sweet and sour sauce, Mr. Leong met a Springfield neurosurgeon, John L. K. Tsang, who was also a native of China. In 1955, Dr. Tsang lured David Leong and his brother, Gee Leong, to Springfield to open the region's first Chinese restaurant, Lotus Garden. 
 It didn't last. A year later the brothers were cooking at the Grove, a supper club famous for T-bones and highballs. They dished up sweet and sour pork and moo goo gai pan. And, inspired by similar Chinese dishes, David Leong experimented with the dish that would become cashew chicken.
 ''When I moved here in the 1950s, people kept telling me about fried chicken,'' Mr. Leong said. ''I did what they wanted. I gave them fried chicken with Chinese oyster sauce and cashews.'' 
 After six years at the Grove, the brothers departed. ''Bill Grove didn't want to pay me to cook,'' David Leong said of the owner. ''He thought anyone could do what I did. He was wrong. Wasn't long before he was begging me to come back. I had my own place by then.'' 
 That new place, Leong's Tea House, set on the suburban fringe of town in what had recently been a cornfield, didn't come easily. Loans were tough to secure. And some locals suspected the motives of Asian immigrants. ''This was not long after the war,'' David Leong said. ''They thought all Asians were Japanese kamikazes.'' 
 In November 1963, less than a week before the new restaurant was set to open, someone tossed 10 sticks of dynamite at the base of the low-slung building and stole the lion statues that flanked the front door. The crime made the local newspaper. But, as was the case with many incidents of bigotry-born violence in the 1960s, no convictions followed. The Leongs bounced back, repairing the damage quickly and opening the 350-seat white-tablecloth restaurant within a couple of weeks. 
 Inspired by the economy of the dish and the success of the teahouse, a number of cashew-chicken-centric restaurants followed the Leongs' lead. (Fewer copied their egg rolls. According to David Leong, the secret ingredient was peanut butter.) 
 In 1972, when the brothers parted ways, Gee Leong opened Gee's East Wind, on the same street, on the opposite end of town. And Cheong Leong, David's oldest son, opened and closed a number of restaurants named House of Cheong, some of which were housed in former Whataburger franchises. 
 Throughout the 1970s, other Asian families immigrated to Springfield. First came other Chinese, then a large influx of Vietnamese. Many opened Chinese restaurants. By the 1970s, the Leong family dish had become such a part of the Springfield culinary ethic that the curriculum at Graff Vocational Technical Center included instruction in the cooking and serving of hillbilly steak sandwiches, chocolate cream pies and, yes, cashew chicken. 
 At the moment, no Leong family member runs a Springfield kitchen. In 1997, after the death of his wife, Wong Shau Ngor, David Leong closed Leong's Tea House. In July 2000, his brother Gee Leong closed Gee's East Wind. (Soon after, he died.) Cheong Leong moved to Las Vegas.
 Wing Yee Leong, 52, another of David's sons, who was manning the fry station at Leong's Tea House when the family restaurant closed, now works as a journeyman chef. Over the last decade he has moved from Cartoon's Oyster Bar to Mikayla's at the Millwood Golf and Racquet Club to Fire and Ice, where he fried chicken and blanched cashews until last December. Each of those restaurants has adopted cashew chicken as its own. 
 More recently, Wing Yee Leong was a consulting chef at Pan Asia, a downtown Springfield restaurant owned by Dara Thach, a Cambodian immigrant. The restaurant closed recently, but before it did, Mr. Thach took pride in the dynamite sauce, a mix of mayonnaise and chili puree, that he served with sushi rolls and the cashew chicken recipe he adapted from the Leong tradition. 
 Occasionally the younger Leong joins his father for an early coffee at Canton Inn. One recent morning, as David Leong read a Cantonese language newspaper, Wing Yee Leong and Foon Wong reminisced about the Cashew Craze fund-raiser that used to take place as a benefit for the Developmental Center of the Ozarks. 
 ''One year the Rasta Grill did a jerk cashew oyster sauce,'' recalled Wing Yee Leong, as he worked a pair of chopsticks, pulling noodles from a bowl of soup. ''I've tried some different stuff myself. Cashew chicken on a stick, fried in cashew flour, with an oyster dipping sauce. Cashew chicken is just like a hamburger. Everybody fixes it different.''

HEADLINE: Some Banks, Feeling Chained, Want to Return Bailout Money

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The list of demands keeps getting longer.
 Financial institutions that are getting government bailout funds have been told to put off evictions and modify mortgages for distressed homeowners. They must let shareholders vote on executive pay packages. They must slash dividends, cancel employee training and morale-building exercises, and withdraw job offers to foreign citizens. 
 As public outrage swells over the rapidly growing cost of bailing out financial institutions, the Obama administration and lawmakers are attaching more and more strings to rescue funds. 
 The conditions are necessary to prevent Wall Street executives from paying lavish bonuses and buying corporate jets, some experts say, but others say the conditions go beyond protecting taxpayers and border on social engineering. 
 Some bankers say the conditions have become so onerous that they want to return the bailout money. The list includes small banks like the TCF Financial Corporation of Wayzata, Minn., and Iberia Bank of Lafayette, La., as well as giants like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. 
 They say they plan to return the money as quickly as possible or as soon as regulators set up a process to accept the refunds. On Tuesday, Signature Bank of New York announced that because of new executive pay restrictions in the economic stimulus package, it notified the Treasury that it intended to return the $120 million it had received from the government only three months ago.
 Other institutions like Johnson Bank of Racine, Wis., initially expressed interest in seeking bailout funds but have now changed their minds. Bank executives told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that one reason they rejected the government money was to avoid any disruption in the bank's role in the local community, including supporting the zoo or opera company if they chose to. 
 One of the biggest concerns of the banks is that the program lets Congress and the administration pile on new conditions at any time. 
 The demands to modify mortgages or forestall evictions are especially onerous, some bank executives and experts say, because they could prompt some institutions to take steps that could lead to greater losses. 
 ''We are taking an approach that wants the banks to help the economy and whether it is ultimately good for a particular bank is secondary,'' said L. William Seidman, the former senior regulator during the savings and loan bailout. ''Weak banks are being asked to do things that will erode their position.''
 A senior Treasury official involved in the bailout effort said the administration was carefully trying not to do anything that could harm the banks and was giving financial incentives to modify mortgages. The official said the restrictions were part of a larger effort to clean up bank balance sheets and assist the economy.
 ''We're having to take some very unpleasant actions when the alternatives are so much worse,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of not being identified.
 But a growing chorus of industry experts are warning that asking weak banks to carry out the government's economic and social policies could increase the drain on the public purse. These experts say that the financial assistance, while helpful in the short run, could force weak banks to engage in lending practices that will lose even more money, and that the government inevitably will become more heavily involved in dictating how banks do business. 
 ''I honestly believe the people in power pushing this policy see it as a win-win -- as something that is good for the banking industry and good for homeowners and others,'' said Douglas J. Elliott, a former investment banker who is now an economics fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''But there is a slippery slope and there are potentially significant negative consequences.''
 Mr. Elliott says that by modifying loans, banks that are already fragile could wind up losing more money. 
 ''What gets us in real trouble,'' he said, ''is when we try to fudge things and pretend that something is in the direct interest of both the government and the financial institutions when it in fact costs the banks money or increases their risk levels.''
 Take Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the housing-finance companies that the government now controls. In recent months, they have been told to spend billions of dollars buying bundles of mortgages for which there are no other buyers, and to let homeowners refinance their loans -- even if they have no equity.
 Such commands are echoes of the 1990s, when Fannie and Freddie tried to balance dueling mandates that required them to make a profit for their shareholders and to serve a public mission of increasing homeownership. 
 In service of both shareholders and what they asserted was the public good, they borrowed extensively in order to buy and hold mortgages in their own investment portfolios. They purchased billions of dollars in risky subprime mortgages. 
 As a consequence of having a public mandate, they also had a credit line with the Treasury and their risky business strategies were viewed by the markets as being guaranteed by the government.
 To satisfy both mandates, the companies also faced fewer restrictions and were allowed to take on more debt than other financial companies. But when buyers began defaulting and home prices plunged, the companies nearly collapsed and last fall were placed under government conservatorship. Mr. Elliott said that some banks participating in the bailout program are now in the same conflicting position that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were in. 
 He and other experts also worry that, by relying on weak banks to carry out the administration's or Congress's policies, officials are not biting the bullet and shutting down weak banks that may be insolvent. 
 At the height of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s and 1990s, Congress and regulators adopted new rules known as ''prompt corrective action'' that required the government to quickly close weak financial institutions if they could not raise money to absorb mounting losses. 
 The rules were a response to a consensus that keeping weak institutions open longer, under an earlier practice known as forbearance, damaged healthy banks competing with the government-subsidized ones and ultimately destabilized the banking system. By shutting weakened institutions before their losses grew, prompt corrective action was also seen as less costly to taxpayers and the deposit insurance fund. 
 Administration officials say that some of the banks at issue today are simply too large to be seized by the government, making comparisons to the savings and loan crisis less meaningful. 
 Moreover, they say, the public outrage over the growing cost of the bailout makes it politically imperative that they exert greater control over the way the money is being spent. 
 But by keeping weak banks operating, the markets continue to sink and taxpayer costs are mounting, outside experts said. ''The current policy is likely to result in weaker banks,'' Mr. Seidman said. ''And keeping insolvent banks in operation does not benefit the system.''
 Some community bankers, whose institutions are stronger than the large money center banks, agree. 
 C. R. Cloutier, the president of MidSouth Bank of Lafayette, La., and a survivor of the savings and loan debacle, said that his institution received $20 million from the rescue fund because he and his board believed it was patriotic and would help them offer loans during a recession. 
 But faced with what he says is an unwarranted stigma of participating in the program, as well as the new restrictions on banks taking the money, he is now considering whether to return the money, as other institutions have sought to do.
 ''Two things you learn in the banking business,'' Mr. Cloutier said. ''The first is, concentration is bad. We now have 64 percent of deposits in eight institutions. The second rule is, your first loss is your best loss. Get it over with. Don't pump water in a dead fish.''

HEADLINE: Energy Dept. Said to Err on Coal Project

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Energy Department made a $500 million math error a year ago when it withdrew its support from a ''near-zero emissions'' coal plant in Illinois, Congressional auditors will say in a report to be released Wednesday. 
 The error led the department to say mistakenly that the project, known as FutureGen, had nearly doubled in cost -- an increase the Bush administration deemed too expensive. 
 At the time, FutureGen was the leading effort to capture and sequester carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas linked to global warming. If the project were resumed and proved successful, it could provide a model for curbing the carbon dioxide that coal adds to the atmosphere. 
 The new energy secretary, Steven Chu, has said that he will consider renewing support for FutureGen but that changes will be needed. He did not specify what those might be.
 The report was prepared by the Government Accountability Office for Representative Bart Gordon, chairman of the House Science Committee. The panel's subcommittee on energy and environment will hold a hearing on the issue on Wednesday.
 Mr. Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee, said, ''I am astonished to learn that the top leadership of the Department of Energy in the last administration made critical decisions about our nation's energy future and capacity to combat global warming based on fundamental budget math errors.''
 He added, ''This is math illiteracy on a grand scale and with global consequences.''
 According to the report, in calculating the costs of the project, the Energy Department mistakenly compared two numbers that should not have been used together. One cost estimate was made in so-called constant dollars, reflecting the purchasing power of a dollar in 2005, and the other in dollars as they would have been spent over the following few years, worth less each year because of inflation.
 The Bush administration said the projected cost had nearly doubled, to $1.8 billion from $950 million; the auditors said it had gone to $1.3 billion, up 39 percent.
 In January 2008, after investing $174 million in FutureGen, the Bush administration withdrew support. The staff of the House committee found internal communications indicating that the leaders of the Energy Department were looking for reasons to kill the project.
 Under the deal, the private sector was supposed to pay 26 percent of FutureGen's costs. The other 74 percent would have been paid mostly by the federal government, although 8 percent would have come from foreign government partners, including China and India, two countries that Washington was hoping to persuade to shift to coal plants that can capture their carbon.
 Some executives of utilities not involved with FutureGen have said the arrangement was too generous to the private partners. But the cancellation was costly, too. The internal documents found by the staff members of the House committee predicted that killing the Illinois project would set back the technology of carbon capture by 10 years.
 What the Energy Department proposed instead was to support carbon capture technologies that would be added to coal plants already built or in the planning stages. But that effort has bogged down, partly because a number of the planned plants were canceled because of high costs.
 The stimulus bill passed by Congress may provide money for the original FutureGen project.

HEADLINE: China's Art Market: Cold Or Maybe Hibernating?

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
A new studio designed by Zeng Fanzhi is a vivid testament to the riches reaped by China's hottest contemporary artists.
 The high-ceilinged 2,200-square-foot space is adorned with European and Chinese antiques, museum-quality floors, a small gym and a traditional landscape garden that Mr. Zeng said contains authentic Ming and Qing dynasty relics. Hanging on the walls are his massive canvases, which not so long ago could easily fetch $1 million apiece.
 But just as he and dozens of other artists in Beijing and Shanghai put the finishing touches on lavish studios that proclaim their success, the market for Chinese contemporary art has entered a downward spiral. 
 A global financial crisis has wiped out vast amounts of personal wealth, prompting a plunge in art prices. Suddenly bereft of visitors, galleries are laying off staff members, and the collectors who patronized them now worry that their art investments may prove a colossal folly.
 ''It's been a long, cold winter,'' said Zoe Butt, director of international programs at Long March Space, which is closing two of its three Beijing galleries. ''The era of Chinese contemporary art commanding such high prices is over.'' 
 Auctions, perhaps the most popular barometer of the recent craze for Chinese contemporary art, have also been hard hit. Sotheby's autumn auction of Chinese contemporary art in October was dismal by comparison with the October 2007 result, with some works going unsold.
 Experts say the contracting market is also putting the squeeze on major collectors, many of whom had been hoping to unload high-priced works in 2009. 
 Globally, the recent rise in Chinese artists' fortunes was unparalleled. Only one Chinese artist -- Zao Wouki, a traditional painter who lives in France -- ranked among the Top 10 best-selling living artists in 2004, according to Artprice.com, which tracks auction sales. (He ranked ninth.) But by 2007, 5 of the 10 best-selling living artists at auction were Chinese-born, led by Zhang Xiaogang, who trailed only Gerhard Richter and Damien Hirst. That year, Mr. Zhang's auction sales totaled $56 million, according to Artprice.com.
 Many collectors were seduced by the numbers. ''For people who got into the market three years ago, I feel sorry for them,'' said Fabien Fryns, who runs F2 Gallery in Beijing.
 Artists who have benefited most from this country's rising profile as an arts center are still living in luxury residences and driving BMWs and Mercedes-Benzes. But recently, they've been getting fewer visitors.
 ''Before, every day visitors would come and knock on the door, and I had to spend the morning taking them around,'' Mr. Zeng said, sitting on a leather sofa in his studio. ''Now it's about half as much.'' 
 He seems somewhat relieved, however. And experts say the market drop may be salubrious in some ways for Chinese art. Soaring prices had created a circuslike atmosphere, with some artists turning their studios into assembly lines that mass-produced their most popular works.
 ''The market zooming up made a lot of people blind and deaf,'' said Jerome Sans, director of the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing. ''Now, we can have production of the mind, not just the product. No more of this making fast money.''
 A crucial test looms for the small number of international galleries that opened here in recent years in the hope of cashing in on the excitement while also developing long-term projects with Chinese artists.
 PaceWildenstein of New York, which now represents Zhang Xiaogang and Zhang Huan, two of the country's most respected artists, signed a 10-year lease last year and is preparing to open a 20,000-square-foot gallery in the 798 Arts District in Beijing.
 ''I don't worry about the downturn too much,'' said Leng Lin, the director of the gallery. ''This is a long-term project. In the future, the market will recover.''
 Acquavella Galleries of New York has also invested in China, agreeing to represent Mr. Zeng, whose crisp, dark portraits of life and nature are popular among European collectors.
 And then there are Guy and Myriam Ullens, the Belgian multimillionaires who founded the sprawling Ullens Contemporary Art Center in 2007 after amassing one of the biggest collections of Chinese contemporary art more than a decade ago.
 Their foundation has recently been shopping that collection, which includes about 1,500 works and is now in Switzerland, to Chinese buyers. But selling a collection that large, possibly as part of a package deal that would include the center they founded in Beijing, may be a challenge.
 Mr. Sans, director of the center, insists that the buyer must be from China.
 ''We're trying to find partners,'' he said. ''We want all the works to stay together and to be controlled by Chinese.''
 Charles Saatchi, the legendary London-based dealer and collector, also invested heavily in Chinese contemporary art in recent years, helping to drive up prices. 
 With collectors hibernating, traffic has slowed in Beijing's 798 Arts District and Shanghai's M50 Arts District, though some say winter is usually a slow time anyway. By April, gallery dealers say, the true extent of the damage may be known.
 ''Collectors call me, but they're more careful'' about spending, said Cheng Xingdong, who operates a large Beijing gallery. ''And because people stopped buying, you don't know the value of the works.''
 The best-known artists may be insulated from the effects of the downturn. Because of their huge exposure in recent years, including newspaper and magazine profiles, many of them now have international reputations and collectors who are still eager to support them.
 Mr. Zeng, who favors European fashions and Chinese antiques, is one of those lucky ones. He's preparing for his first solo exhibition in New York, at the Acquavella Galleries, and another show this spring at the Suzhou Museum, designed by I. M. Pei.
 He said he was even gratified that he did not sell too many of his paintings over the last few years. If the market were now flooded with his works, he reasons, their value would be far lower.
 Mr. Zeng opened a door to a storage room in the rear of the studio filled with dozens of works and smiled. ''That would have been a disaster.''

HEADLINE: Big Advance for 'Time Traveler' Novelist

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Six years after the publication of her blockbuster best-selling novel, ''The Time Traveler's Wife,'' Audrey Niffenegger has sold a new manuscript for close to $5 million, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations. It is an especially significant sum at a time of retrenchment and economic uncertainty in the publishing world.
 After a fiercely contested auction, Scribner, a unit of Simon & Schuster, bought the rights to publish the new novel, ''Her Fearful Symmetry,'' in the United States this fall. The book is a supernatural story about twins who inherit an apartment near a London cemetery and become embroiled in the lives of the building's other residents and the ghost of their aunt, who left them the flat. 
 The auction for Ms. Niffenegger's second novel involved several large New York publishing houses, as well as the original hardcover publisher of ''The Time Traveler's Wife,'' MacAdam/Cage, the San Francisco-based independent, and the publisher that holds paperback rights to the first novel, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. 
 Ms. Niffenegger, a visual artist who is also a faculty member at Columbia College Chicago, Center for Book and Paper Arts, became a publishing sensation with ''The Time Traveler's Wife,'' her debut novel. 
 ''Her Fearful Symmetry'' is set to go on sale at the end of September, and will coincide with the British publication by Jonathan Cape this fall. The film adaptation of ''The Time Traveler's Wife,'' directed by Robert Schwentke and starring Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana, is scheduled for a February release.
 When ''The Time Traveler's Wife'' was published in hardcover in 2003 by MacAdam/Cage, it became a little-engine-that-could story about a small publisher that turned a literary novel into a best seller. The work was selected by the ''Today'' show book club and sold 119,000 copies, according to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks about 70 percent of retail sales. The paperback was released by what was then the Harvest imprint of Harcourt, which is now a part of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and has sold nearly 1.3 million copies.
 As publishers seek sure bets, Ms. Niffenegger's new novel attracted widespread interest. But second novels can be risky. Charles Frazier, the author of ''Cold Mountain,'' for example, received an $8 million advance for his second book, ''Thirteen Moons,'' but it did not sell as well as his first.
 The track record of ''The Time Traveler's Wife'' inevitably figured into publishers' calculations as they bid on ''Her Fearful Symmetry'' last week. But Nan Graham, vice president and editor in chief of Scribner, said that whereas Mr. Frazier sold his second novel on the basis of just a brief outline of the planned work, Ms. Niffenegger had completed a full manuscript. ''She really has defied custom and written a spectacular second novel, which is one of the hardest things to do in this universe,'' Ms. Graham said. ''She's not selling it essentially on the success of her first book.''
 Joe Regal, Ms. Niffenegger's agent, said: ''There are going to be people coming to the book with claws out. That's just reality. It's for reasons completely unconnected to the book.'' He added that even ''The Time Traveler's Wife'' faced naysayers. ''There were lots of people who dismissed the first book because it sounded like romance or science fiction or said because it sold so well, it can't be good,'' Mr. Regal said. ''The thing she has control over is writing a great book. She did it once, and she's done it again.'' 
 Mr. Regal said that Ms. Niffenegger felt loyal to MacAdam/Cage -- which paid only $100,000 for ''The Time Traveler's Wife'' -- and would have liked to have stayed with the publisher that originally turned her into a literary star. But that publisher has lately been struggling financially and, in the end, Mr. Regal said, ''It was just too big a gulf.'' Mr. Regal declined to say how much Ms. Niffenegger had received as an advance for the new novel.
 He added that Scribner published both literary fiction and Stephen King. ''It strikes me if you have a literary writer with a ghost, you could do worse,'' Mr. Regal said.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart To Digitize Health Data

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores is striding into the market for electronic health records, seeking to bring the technology into the mainstream for physicians in small offices, where most of America's doctors practice medicine.
 Wal-Mart's move comes as the Obama administration is trying to jump-start the adoption of digital medical records with $19 billion of incentives in the economic stimulus package.
 The company plans to team its Sam's Club division with Dell for computers and eClinicalWorks, a fast-growing private company, for software. Wal-Mart says its package deal of hardware, software, installation, maintenance and training will make the technology more accessible and affordable, undercutting rival health information technology suppliers by as much as half. 
 ''We're a high-volume, low-cost company,'' said Marcus Osborne, senior director for health care business development at Wal-Mart. ''And I would argue that mentality is sorely lacking in the health care industry.''
 The Sam's Club offering, to be made available this spring, will be under $25,000 for the first physician in a practice, and about $10,000 for each additional doctor. After the installation and training, continuing annual costs for maintenance and support will be $4,000 to $6,500 a year, the company estimates.
 Wal-Mart says it had explored the opportunity in health information technology long before the presidential election. About 200,000 health care providers, mostly doctors, are among Sam Club's 47 million members. And the company's research showed the technology was becoming less costly and interest was rising among small physician practices, according to Todd Matherly, vice president for health and wellness at Sam's Club.
 The financial incentives in the administration plan -- more than $40,000 per physician over a few years, to install and use electronic health records -- could accelerate adoption. When used properly, most health experts agree, digital records can curb costs and improve care.
 But many, especially physicians in small offices, doubt the wisdom of switching to electronic health records, given their cost and complexity.
 Only about 17 percent of the nation's physicians are using computerized patient records, according to a government-sponsored survey published last year in The New England Journal of Medicine. The use of electronic health records is widespread in large physician groups, but three-fourths of the nation's doctors work in small practices of 10 physicians or fewer.
 Wal-Mart, however, has the potential to bring not only lower costs but also an efficient distribution channel to cater to small physician groups. Traditional health technology suppliers, experts say, have tended to shun the small physician offices because it has been costly to sell to them. Taken together, they make up a large market, but they are scattered.
 ''If Wal-Mart is successful, this could be a game-changer,'' observed Dr. David J. Brailer, former national coordinator for health information technology in the Bush administration.
 In the package, Dell is offering either a desktop or a tablet personal computer. Many physicians prefer tablet PCs because they more closely resemble their familiar paper notepads and make for easier communication with the patient, since the doctor is not behind a desktop screen.
 EClinicalWorks, which is used by 25,000 physicians, mostly in small practices, will provide the electronic record and practice management software, for billing and patient registration, as a service over the Internet. This ''software as a service'' model can trim costs considerably and make technical support and maintenance less complicated, because less software resides on the personal computer in a doctor's office.
 Dell will be responsible for installation of the computers, while eClinicalWorks will handle software installation, training and maintenance. Wal-Mart is using its buying power for discounts on both the hardware and software.
 Wal-Mart's role, according to Mr. Osborne, is to put the bundle of technology into an affordable and accessible offering. ''We're the systems integrator, an aggregator,'' he said.
 The company's test bed for the technology it will soon offer physicians has been its own health care clinics, staffed by third-party physicians and nurses. Started in September 2006, 30 such clinics are now in stores in eight states. The clinics use the technology Wal-Mart will offer to physicians.
 ''That's where the learning came from, and they were the kernel of this idea,'' Mr. Osborne said.

HEADLINE: If You Think You're Good, You Should Think Again

BYLINE: By DWIGHT GARNER

 BODY:
THE LIFE YOU CAN SAVE
 Acting Now to End World Poverty
 By Peter Singer
 206 pages. Random House. $22.
 Are you a good person?
 The proper answer to that question is, of course, ''Go away.''
 But you might reply that it depends on how one defines the word good. In a world of easily identified devils -- Osama bin Laden, Kim Jong-Il, Bernard Madoff -- most of us feel we're basically on the side of the angels. We work hard, pay our bills, try to raise our children well, volunteer a bit here and there and, when in doubt, abide by the golden rule. (Don't we?) Why not give ourselves the benefit of the doubt?
 Peter Singer's new book about world poverty, ''The Life You Can Save,'' is here to tell us that we aren't, most of us, the people we think we are. On a planet full of so much obvious and widespread suffering, he writes, ''there is something deeply askew with our widely accepted views about what it is to live a good life.'' 
 Mr. Singer, a professor of bioethics at Princeton University and perhaps America's most famous specialist in applied ethics, has made a career out of making people feel uncomfortable. His best-known book, ''Animal Liberation'' (1975), is among the founding texts of the contemporary animal-rights movement. He has been working out the ideas in ''The Life You Can Save'' since at least 1972, when he published his influential essay ''Famine, Affluence and Morality.''
 Mr. Singer is far from the world's only serious thinker about poverty, but with ''The Life You Can Save'' he becomes, instantly, its most readable and lapel-grabbing one. This book is part rational argument, part stinging manifesto, part handbook. It's a volume that suggests, given that 18 million people are dying unnecessarily each year in developing countries, that there is a ''moral stain on a world as rich as this one.'' We are not doing enough to help our fellow mortals.
 Human beings have an intuitive belief that we should help others in need, Mr. Singer writes, ''at least when we can see them and when we are the only person in a position to save them.'' But we need to go beyond these intuitions, Mr. Singer declares. And so, early in ''The Life You Can Save,'' he proposes the following logical argument, one I'll quote in full:
 ''First premise: Suffering and death from lack of food, shelter and medical care are bad.
 Second premise: If it is in your power to prevent something bad from happening, without sacrificing anything nearly as important, it is wrong not to do so.
 Third premise: By donating to aid agencies, you can prevent suffering and death from lack of food, shelter and medical care, without sacrificing anything nearly as important.
 Conclusion: Therefore, if you do not donate to aid agencies, you are doing something wrong.'' 
 To reject this argument, Mr. Singer writes, ''you need to find a flaw in the reasoning.'' 
 It's pretty tempting to try to toss Mr. Singer's argument back in his face. The counterarguments well up in your mind: The economy is tanking. Charity begins at home. I work hard for my money. Charity breeds dependency. Some charity groups waste too much money on overhead. And doesn't everyone hate a do-gooder? (In a 2008 Reuters poll, Madonna was voted the least-liked celebrity do-gooder. Mr. Singer strongly defends her.) 
 Mr. Singer convincingly dismisses these counterarguments, and his logical conclusion above is well-nigh irrefutable. Helping the world's poor will bring ''meaning and purpose'' to our lives, he suggests, through financial adjustments that will mostly ''make no difference to your well-being.'' 
 In his book, which began as a series of lectures at Oxford University and as an article for The New York Times Magazine, Mr. Singer praises many people who give away as much as 50 percent of their annual income. For the rest of us, he proposes a more realistic approach: ''Roughly 5 percent of annual income for those who are financially comfortable, and rather more for the very rich.'' 
 (Maybe you're asking yourself, as I did: Am I ''financially comfortable''? My mortgage, my credit-card bills and my other debts scream no. But the $3 coffee I'm drinking while I type this, and the Lucinda Williams concert tickets I just bought, tell me there is wiggle room in my budget.)
 Some of Mr. Singer's contentions are harder to stomach. ''Philanthropy for the arts or for cultural activities is, in a world like this one, morally dubious,'' he declares. The Metropolitan Museum of Art bought a painting by Duccio in 2004 for more than $45 million, an amount, Mr. Singer says, that would pay for cataract operations on 900,000 blind or near-blind people in the developing world. 
 He continues: ''If the museum were on fire, would anyone think it right to save the Duccio from the flames, rather than a child?'' 
 You can agree with him in general while suggesting -- to give just one example -- that society was ennobled rather than hurt, during the Great Depression, by the money the Works Progress Administration, while not a philanthropy, spent on drama, literature and arts projects.
 Mr. Singer's book has its heroes and villains. Among the former are Bill Gates and, interestingly, James Hong, who became a millionaire after founding the fluky Web site Hot or Not, where people's looks are rated by strangers. Mr. Hong donates 10 percent of every dollar he makes over $100,000 each year, and he runs a different Web site encouraging others to make the same pledge. 
 Among the villains of ''The Life You Can Save'' are the software billionaires Paul Allen and Larry Ellison. Mr. Singer concedes that Mr. Ellison gave away $39 million in 2007. But he adds, ''If Ellison never earned another dollar, he could give away $39 million every year for the next 600 years and still have more than $1 billion as a cushion for his old age.'' 
 There is time for Mr. Ellison. As Mr. Singer points out, if Warren Buffett had given away the first million he'd made, he would not be in a position now to be giving $31 billion away. But most of us are never going to be Warren Buffett.
 On one of Mr. Singer's Web sites, thelifeyoucansave.com, he asks people to sign up to donate to world poverty along the sliding scale he proposes. (He himself gives away about 25 percent of his annual income, he writes.) So far there are more than 800 names. 
 ''We tend to think that people are more to blame for their acts,'' Mr. Singer observes, ''than for their omissions.'' You don't have to agree with everything in ''The Life You Can Change'' to feel that there's no real debate: When it comes to living the so-called ''good'' life, one's moral omissions count more than ever.

HEADLINE: Two Political Rivals, One Playbook

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
Tucked into an angular lounge chair in an Art Deco suite above Radio City Music Hall on Monday evening, Ann Coulter, the conservative author, was awaiting her would-be adversary, the liberal comedian Bill Maher. She and Mr. Maher had agreed to face off in a series of debates over the next three nights, and Ms. Coulter was concerned that their material might go stale from repeated performances.
 ''Bill wants me to behave like a wife who laughs each time she hears her husband tell the same story,'' Ms. Coulter said. ''I told him I'm not an actress, or I'd have a bigger apartment.''
 A few minutes later, Mr. Maher, host of the HBO series ''Real Time With Bill Maher,'' entered the room, dressed in jeans and a Planet Hollywood jacket. He hugged Ms. Coulter, and noted the high-heeled shoes she was wearing. 
 ''Did you get taller?'' Mr. Maher asked.
 ''I wanted to intimidate you,'' Ms. Coulter replied teasingly. They sat as their moderator, Mark Halperin, an editor at large for Time magazine, explained the rules of the debate (''Basically, I'm going to stay out of your way,'' Mr. Halperin said), then retired to separate dressing rooms.
 This was not necessarily the sort of showdown that promoters expected when they signed up Ms. Coulter (whose books include ''Guilty: Liberal 'Victims' and Their Assault on America'') and Mr. Maher (whose recent documentary, ''Religulous,'' satirized organized faiths) for a three-day tour.
 The debates began on Monday in New York and were to continue Tuesday in Boston and Wednesday in Chicago. They begin the 2009 Speaker Series, an annual roster of public-affairs events. Last year's calendar included former President Bill Clinton, former Senator John Edwards and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor. Coming events feature Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, on a panel with Arianna Huffington and D. L. Hughley (on March 31) and the political strategists James Carville and Karl Rove (on May 26). 
 To begin the 2009 schedule, producers wanted theatrics as well as politics, with rivals whose verbal sparring would ''inspire and impassion'' audiences, said Melissa Ormond, the chief operating officer of MSG Entertainment, which produces the series. In Mr. Maher and Ms. Coulter, they saw outspoken entertainers who could reliably generate sparks (and ticket sales), assuming they would share a stage.
 ''You'd be surprised how easy it was to convince them,'' Ms. Ormond said. 
 Although Mr. Maher and Ms. Coulter play antagonists when called upon, they rarely have been mortal enemies. In the 1990s Ms. Coulter, best known then as a lawyer, cable news analyst and advocate for the impeachment of Mr. Clinton, was a frequent guest on Mr. Maher's ABC series, ''Politically Incorrect,'' where she traded jabs with the likes of Jon Stewart and Chris Rock.
 In a predebate telephone interview, Mr. Maher said that he and Ms. Coulter were good friends -- ''Not dating, as people try to say on the Internet, but friends'' -- and that he respected her resolve. ''Unlike so many people in America, she was not afraid to get booed,'' Mr. Maher said. 
 Ms. Coulter likewise said that she respected Mr. Maher's bipartisan approach to ''Politically Incorrect.'' ''Unlike most snoozefest political shows, Bill booked guests who didn't all agree with one another,'' she wrote in response to questions sent by e-mail.
 But in this decade, their relationship has on occasion turned contentious. When Ms. Coulter appeared on Mr. Maher's HBO series in 2003, he accused her of making up facts. (He used far stronger language.)
 And in 2007, when Ms. Coulter was criticized for remarking that she could not describe Mr. Edwards without using an antigay slur, she countered that the media should pay more attention to Mr. Maher, who, she said, had wished for then-Vice President Dick Cheney to be killed by a bomb. (Mr. Maher was defending the rights of bloggers to make such comments.) 
 Critics from across the political spectrum have complained that Mr. Maher and Ms. Coulter are essentially operating from the same playbook. ''They share the assumption that the most extreme formulation of an idea is its truest one,'' said Leon Wieseltier, literary editor of The New Republic. 
 In a blog post for The Daily Beast, thedailybeast.com, Meghan McCain, the oldest daughter of Senator John McCain, wrote that Ms. Coulter was ''offensive, radical, insulting and confusing all at the same time,'' and that her appearances with Mr. Maher seemed ''more like a traveling circus than a serious debate.''
 Both debaters acknowledged that a certain amount of provocation was part of their strategy. ''I'm a comedian,'' Mr. Maher said. ''I'm always trying to get a laugh, but I do not say things I do not believe to get a laugh.''
 In an e-mail message, Ms. Coulter wrote, ''I'm trying to express ideas, usually about important issues, and if a point is made well, that will tend to elicit a reaction.''
 At their best, said Andrew Ferguson, a senior editor at The Weekly Standard, Ms. Coulter and Mr. Maher aspired to be ''publicists'' as the term was once applied to public intellectuals like H. L. Mencken and William F. Buckley Jr., meaning ''a mediator between the world of ideas and the world of popular culture, who translates ideas into a more digestible form.'' 
 Not that Mr. Ferguson expected a Coulter-Maher face-off to rival the Lincoln-Douglas debates. ''It's like the Battle of Stalingrad,'' he said. ''Any sensible person would want both of them to lose.''
 Mr. Maher, who said he still regarded Ms. Coulter as ''a witty, fun drinking companion,'' hoped to use the debate to challenge her views. Ms. Coulter said she agreed to participate because, she wrote, ''I'm getting a private car.''
 After being introduced on Monday night by Mr. Halperin, Ms. Coulter and Mr. Maher each made opening statements. Ms. Coulter tweaked the news media for being too deferential to President Obama and for comparing him to Lincoln and Jesus. (''They like carpenters,'' Ms. Coulter said of the media. ''It's plumbers they hate.'')
 Mr. Maher praised the president for daring to quote Voltaire, and criticized Republicans for nominating Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, for vice president. (''They've gone from the party of Lincoln to the party of winkin,' '' he said.)
 Then they fielded questions from Mr. Halperin on various topics, from Mr. Obama's recent decision to lift strict limits on stem-cell research (Mr. Maher was in favor, Ms. Coulter opposed) to the causes of the economic crisis (Mr. Maher: greedy bankers; Ms Coulter: ''yuppie-scum house flippers'').
 Though their exchanges were often heated -- provoking cheers, boos, heckling and counterheckling from audience members -- the combatants could be jocular. Skeptical of Ms. Coulter's claim that many scientists do not believe in evolution, Mr. Maher told her, ''You're just being a dunk-tank clown, looking to sell more baseballs.''
 And when Mr. Halperin asked Ms. Coulter to comment on the recent war of words between Rush Limbaugh and the Obama administration, she lamented, ''I have a book out now -- why couldn't they have attacked me?''
 But when Mr. Halperin asked Mr. Maher if he agreed with Ms. McCain's criticisms of Ms. Coulter, Mr. Maher declined to take the bait.
 Instead, he poked fun at himself. The perception that he and Ms. Coulter like to start fights is a mistaken one, he explained. ''It's just because others are wrong,'' Mr. Maher said. ''I would love a world where I never had to argue.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 12, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about a series of debates between the liberal comedian Bill Maher and the conservative author Ann Coulter referred incorrectly to Senator John McCain's daughter Meghan McCain, who wrote a blog post for The Daily Beast criticizing Ms. Coulter. Ms. McCain is the oldest daughter of the senator and his second wife, Cindy; she is not Mr. McCain's oldest daughter. (His oldest is Sidney McCain, whom he had with his first wife, Carol.)

HEADLINE: In a Switch, Citigroup Lifts Stocks

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Hopes that maybe, just maybe, the nation's beleaguered banks are on the mend swept Wall Street on Tuesday, unleashing a breathtaking stock market rally that left investors a bit giddy but had many experts warning that this rally, like so many before it, could falter as fast as it began. 
 After months of disheartening losses, investors finally got a taste of what they desperately craved -- a glimmer of good news in the financial industry -- from none other than Citigroup, the biggest and most troubled of the nation's troubled big banks.
 In a memorandum sent to Citigroup employees on Monday night, Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's beleaguered chief executive, said that after more than a year of staggering losses and three rescues from Washington, the giant financial company was once again making money. Citigroup, he said, was on track for its strongest quarter since late 2007, when waves of bad loans and trading losses began to crash down on the company. 
 But few analysts saw a quick end to the troubles at Citigroup or at other financial companies. Indeed, many predicted that Citigroup and other banks would suffer further losses as the recession deepened. Given the precarious state of the global economy, even optimists were reluctant to call an end to the bear market. 
 ''We poor investors, we don't need much to make us happy, we've been beat up so hard,'' said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. ''At this point we'll take whatever we can get.''
 So for a day, at least, a hint of good news was enough. The Dow Jones industrial average soared 379.44 points, or 5.8 percent, to 6,926.49, its biggest one-day gain this year and one of the biggest since World War II. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 43.07 points, or 6.37 percent, to 719.60; the Nasdaq composite index rose 89.64 points, or 7.07 percent, to 1,358.28.
 Battered financial shares paced the gains. Citigroup's share price, which briefly sank below $1 last week, rose 40 cents, to $1.45. Other banks big and small posted similar gains. 
 But market bears insisted that, despite the rally, nothing had really changed. Investors' hopes, the skeptics argued, were misplaced. Since last October, the Dow has staged five of its biggest one-day rallies in postwar history, only to falter again and sink to new lows. 
 Even after Tuesday's gains, the Dow and the S.& P. 500 were still down more than 20 percent this year, and shares of financial companies were more than 40 percent lower.
 But for traders, the sight of green on their screens offered a welcome relief from the relentless torrent of red as stocks churned steadily lower over the last month, dragging financial markets to their lowest levels in about 12 years.
 ''The volatility breeds a lot of nervousness, and that nervousness breeds opportunity,'' said Anthony Conroy, head equity trader at BNY ConvergEx Group. ''It was a one-way trade for so long, and it looks like we're turning here.''
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, added to the day's optimism by calling for broad reforms in the financial regulatory system, including an examination of accounting rules that govern how companies value their assets. 
 Mr. Bernanke, speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations, said he did not support suspending mark-to-market accounting rules, under which businesses peg asset values to the current market prices. But he said he supported a review to ensure that weaknesses in the rules were identified and fixed.
 ''Further review of accounting standards governing valuation and loss provisioning would be useful, and might result in modifications to the accounting rules,'' he said in his speech.
 Investors also cheered signals from lawmakers and the Securities and Exchange Commission that officials were poised to restore the uptick rule, which is intended to slow short-selling. The rule was lifted in 2007, and critics have said its absence contributed to the breathtaking pace of declines in stock prices.
 But the main catalyst was the news from Citigroup, which, with large consumer and investment banking operations in more than 100 countries, is viewed as a proxy for the broader banking industry. Mr. Pandit, in his memo, held out a few rays of hope. 
 ''I, like you, am disappointed with our current stock price and the broad-based misperceptions about our company and its financial position,'' Mr. Pandit said. But Citigroup, he said, was financially sound, its businesses strong and its deposits relatively stable. 
 ''Over time, the markets will recognize the many strengths of Citi,'' Mr. Pandit said. 
 For Citigroup, a big question is whether it can generate enough earnings to withstand expected new losses. Citigroup could yet incur $55.5 billion in additional markdowns over the next 18 months, according to a recent CreditSights analysis. 
 In his memo, Mr. Pandit signaled that Citigroup could absorb those losses. He said the bank was profitable through January and February, when it generated a combined $19 billion in revenue thanks to strong trading results and fatter lending margins. 
 Many analysts were skeptical. Citigroup's profits could be fleeting if the global economy worsens substantially. 
 ''Citi is not out of the woods. It is certainly good news that Citi is profitable, but I would not overplay the positives.'' said Michael Mayo, a financial services analyst at Deutsche Bank. ''They still have write-downs and an increase of problem assets, and they are still dependent on what the regulators do.''
 Indeed, regulators are currently conducting ''stress tests'' for Citigroup and 18 other big banks to assess the depths of their problems, and while Mr. Pandit said he was confident that Citigroup was adequately capitalized, many analysts question whether the company will require another government rescue. Also hanging in the balance is whether a plan to have government-backed investment funds buy up toxic assets from the banks can get off the ground.
 But given the market's precipitous decline of late, it not entirely surprising to see stocks rebound sharply, if only for a short time. 
 ''When stocks have been battered as much as they have, it doesn't take that much good news to move them forward,'' said Marc Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust. ''This isn't a green light to investors, but the tone is much more constructive now.''
 As investors surged back into stocks, gold prices retreated to just under $900 an ounce and the price of safe-haven Treasury debt fell back as the yield on the 10-year note rose to 3 percent. 
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auctions for four-week and 52-week bills and three-year notes:

HEADLINE: Dunn and Abreu Wanted Only by Their Countries

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

DATELINE: TORONTO 

 BODY:
They have built their careers on waiting for the right pitch. But Adam Dunn and Bobby Abreu never expected to need that skill in the off-season. The most patient hitters in baseball had their patience tried like never before.
 Dunn ranks first in the majors in walks since 2004, and Abreu is second. Dunn is all but a lock for 40 home runs a season, Abreu for 20. Both routinely drive in and score 100 runs. Yet both were unemployed a month ago. 
 ''It's hard to believe and to understand our situation,'' Abreu said. ''And I do understand the economy situation. But just look at the numbers, and it's a surprise. The numbers have been consistent every year. You just kind of wonder.''
 As economic casualties go, Abreu and Dunn will receive no sympathy outside baseball. By the middle of February, both had jobs: Abreu for one year and $5 million with the Los Angeles Angels, and Dunn for two years and $20 million with the Washington Nationals. Still, Abreu took an $11 million pay cut, and Dunn a $3 million reduction. 
 ''Kind of strange,'' said Ted Lilly, who will start for the United States on Wednesday against Venezuela, a 10-1 victor over Italy on Tuesday. 
 Abreu, who is from Venezuela, and Dunn, from Houston, have been two of the more enthusiastic participants in the World Baseball Classic. Unwanted by so many teams in free agency, they are savoring their spots on national teams.
 ''This is my home team,'' said Abreu, who also took part in 2006. ''It's crazy. You see the fans for your country, they come here and it means a lot.''
 Unlike in 2006, when the United States roster had the outsize egos of Roger Clemens and Alex Rodriguez, this team has a collegial vibe. Approachable players with a sense of humor, like Dunn, Dustin Pedroia and Jimmy Rollins, have been a reason.
 Asked which player he has most enjoyed getting to know, Lilly mentioned Dunn, who was added to the roster after an injury to Brad Hawpe.
 ''Adam Dunn is a lot of fun,'' Lilly said. 
 Dunn has homered in both United States victories here. One home run was a line drive to left-center field, and one was a towering blast pulled to right. The United States manager, Davey Johnson, compared his power to that of Willie McCovey, a Hall of Famer.
 ''I've seen a lot of big guys that swing the bat hard,'' Johnson said. ''But he has a really good eye for a big, strong guy.''
 Dunn swings big and misses big, too. He has 886 strikeouts over the last five seasons, 181 more than the next closest player, Jason Bay. 
 ''I know that I'm capable of a lot more than what I've done,'' Dunn said. ''That's what's frustrating about me.''
 Dunn, 29, was criticized last season by an unexpected source -- Blue Jays General Manager J. P. Ricciardi, who told a Toronto radio station that he would never trade for Dunn.
 ''Do you know that the guy really doesn't like baseball all that much?'' Ricciardi said. ''Do you know the guy doesn't have a passion to play the game that much? We have done our homework on guys like Adam Dunn.''
 Ricciardi later apologized, and Dunn bristled when a local reporter broached the topic Saturday. He was equally frosty about his protracted free agency. ''I'm just glad it's over,'' he said.
 Dunn does not want anyone spoiling his fun. On Tuesday, Dunn, a 6-foot-6, 240-pound outfielder/first baseman, took grounders at second, a clunky performance Derek Jeter would not describe.
 ''I'll stay away from that one,'' Jeter said, laughing.
 Dunn said the charged atmosphere here has been the highlight of his career. After the tournament, he will return to a team coming off 102 losses.
 The Nationals have little hope of making the playoffs, but Dunn spoke highly of the team. 
 ''I really like it and I have a lot of fun,'' he said. ''It's a bunch of young guys that have a lot of potential. If we're able to turn it around, that's going to be a great place to win.''

HEADLINE: The Lost Art Of the Irish Pub

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
FOR a half-Norwegian guy from Long Island, Bill Barich knows a thing or two about Irish pubs.
 ''A good pub is a place devoted to conversation, with drink as the lubricant,'' Mr. Barich said one evening last week. ''In an American bar, the minute you finish your drink they say, 'Do you want another?' You'd never see that in a good pub.'' 
 As it happened, he was drinking a pint of Bass and holding forth on the topic at the Kinsale Tavern, an Irish pub on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. 
 Mr. Barich, a writer, spent much of his adult life in California and set several of his books there, among them the horse racing classic ''Laughing in the Hills.'' But for the last eight years he has lived in Ireland, and the Kinsale felt like familiar turf.
 ''A great many pubs in Dublin would look like this,'' he said, noting the numerous TVs tuned to soccer and the piped-in music. 
 In fact, Mr. Barich has been in a great many pubs in the last two years, researching his new book, ''A Pint of Plain'' (Walker, $25), a rumination on Irish pub culture, if not a travelogue by way of the barroom. The book, his eighth, grew out of Mr. Barich's own search to find a good local pub near his home in Dublin, a personal goal that might seem to rank low on the difficulty scale in a country that has nearly 12,000 pubs and where Guinness was once promoted as a source of nutrition. 
 But finding a pub with the same low-key atmosphere and traditional decor as Pat Cohan's, the country pub in John Ford's film ''The Quiet Man,'' proved elusive.
 An early candidate, R. McSorley & Sons, had ''a musty dignity that spoke of permanence,'' as Mr. Barich writes, and antique bric-a-brac on the walls. But soon after he became a regular the pub was sold and given a slick makeover by new owners, who told Mr. Barich that the old decorations were phony anyway -- purchased for nostalgic effect. 
 And so it went. Some pubs were unresponsive to foreigners, or ''blow-ins.'' Others doubled as pickup spots or resembled sports bars, with 24-7 TV coverage replacing the joys of idle banter. 
 Mr. Barich's fascination with what he calls ''fairy tale Ireland'' surely complicated matters; the interior of the fabled Pat Cohan's, which for many represents the quintessential Irish pub, was built on a Hollywood soundstage. But his hunt also revealed how Irish pub culture is changing with the society around it.
 In years past, a pub was a family-run business, and the publican more than likely lived upstairs -- an arrangement that created an intimacy across the bar.
 ''A good publican is a person with character, concerned about the welfare of patrons,'' Mr. Barich said. That a barman could aspire to one day own a pub himself made for a system of dues paying that also resulted in better service. 
 But with trophy pubs now commanding as much as $8 million, a shift has been made to partnerships or corporations that may own and manage several bars. At the same time, more Irish are drinking wine, and drinking at home or in restaurants, chipping away at the social relevance of pubs. 
 The changes are most pronounced in the countryside, where verdant fields gave way to suburban sprawl in a period of rampant economic growth (now considerably tamed) known as the Celtic Tiger. The farmers who once treated rural pubs as community centers are selling off their fields, or else being frightened away from the barstool by strict drunken driving laws. ''The loss of those country pubs signifies a huge change,'' Mr. Barich said. 
 It's a transformation other Irish natives have noticed. Larry Kirwan, who sings in the New York-based Irish rock band Black 47, said his hometown, Wexford, 85 miles south of Dublin, has more than 50 pubs, ''and there's only one where I can find that old tradition.'' 
 The pub, Mary's Bar, is basically one room and was run until recently by a now-deceased publican who was known to break out a harmonica and lead impromptu sing-alongs.
 In pubs like Mary's, Mr. Kirwan said, ''there's almost a Talmudic sense of rules and conventions to be observed.'' Chief among them is not getting overly plastered.
 ''Nobody wants drunks in Irish pubs because they're boring,'' he said, ''and the last thing you want to be called is boring.''
 Instead, traditional pubs foster warmth and fraternity.
 ''For the couple of hours that you're in there,'' Mr. Kirwan said, ''you mesh with this community and your personal troubles are shed.''
 It's these qualities that have made the Irish pub such a popular global export. You can scarcely go anywhere without seeing a Paddy Reilly's or a Flann O'Brien's, the shamrocks on the walls as predictable as the Guinness on tap. 
 Some pubs model themselves on the Irish Pub Concept, a program sanctioned by the beverage conglomerate Diageo-Guinness USA that offers tips for authentic replication -- for instance, adding ''& Sons'' to a name to convey history. 
 After many pints drunk on many barstools over the course of many evenings, Mr. Barich did turn up a few watering holes to rival Pat Cohan's, notably a pub in Dublin north of the Liffey River and far from the tourists called John Kavanagh, but better known as the Gravediggers.
 Stepping inside, Mr. Barich was met by a wood bar that has been there since the 1830s, and a publican, Eugene Kavanagh, who lives above the business and is so devoted to his pub's continued existence that he had been prepared to put it in a trust if none of his children wanted to take over. (It was unnecessary.) 
 ''It's not my job,'' he told the writer. ''It's my life.''
 Naturally, Mr. Barich sat down and ordered a pint.

HEADLINE: Rising Appeal of Short-Term Leases

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
Both tenants and landlords seem to be growing afraid of commitment these days. With the economic outlook murky at best, fewer of them want to tie themselves to long leases.
 In Manhattan, where office leases often last 10 years, there has been a noticeable uptick recently of leases lasting only one to three years. Some prominent landlords have begun playing up the availability of short-term leases in their buildings.
 For example, Paramount Group is advertising two-year leases at 1633 Broadway, between 50th and 51st Streets. And the Kushner Companies sent promotional materials to brokers advertising one- and two-year leases for finished offices in 666 Fifth Avenue, a prime office tower that spans the entire blockfront of Fifth Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Streets. 
 In all of Manhattan, 21 percent of the office leases that were signed in the fourth quarter of 2008 were for three years or less, compared with 15 percent in the corresponding quarter a year earlier, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate brokerage firm that compiles data on commercial transactions. Brokers say they expect short-term leases to become even more fashionable this year.
 ''There's a lot of anxiety out there, and short-term decisions are easier to rationalize,'' said David L. Hoffman Jr., a principal at Colliers ABR, a real estate services company.
 Mr. Hoffman is the leasing agent for some office towers in Manhattan whose landlords have recently signed short-term renewals with existing tenants. ''There were tenants with one foot out the door, who were leaving spaces that required large capital improvements,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''We decided it was more cost-effective to keep them in place.''
 In recent months, he has negotiated five short-term lease renewals at 360 Lexington Avenue, a 24-story, 262,000-square-foot office tower on the northwest corner of 40th Street. Three of these renewals were for two years, and two were for one year.
 Brokers say that smaller tenants tend to favor short-term leases now, while large office tenants still prefer the stability of long-term leases. For example, the short-term leases that Mr. Hoffman negotiated at 360 Lexington Avenue ranged in size from 2,500 square feet to 7,300 square feet. The tenants included a law firm, a technology firm, a small financial firm and two missions to the United Nations, which is nearby.
 The building is owned by AEW Capital Management, a real estate company based in Boston, which bought it for $129 million in August. ''We did not forecast higher rents when we bought the building, because the Bear Stearns building was nearby, and we knew there would be a shakeout in the financial sector,'' said Jeff Furber, the chief executive of AEW Capital Management, which is a subsidiary of Natixis Global Asset Management, a French investment firm. Indeed, he said, ''we liked the building because it didn't have a lot of financial firms in it.''
 Mr. Furber said that tenants were driving the demand for short-term contracts and that he would be happy to sign office leases for five years or more. ''But business conditions are deteriorating so rapidly,'' Mr. Furber said. ''Tenants are saying that they're just not sure how much space they'll need in a year or two, so it is hard for them to commit.''
 Matthew Astrachan, an executive vice president at Cushman & Wakefield, who represents both office tenants and landlords, said that the Manhattan office market had recently become a ''tenants' market,'' meaning tenants now have the upper hand in negotiations with landlords.
 The vacancy rate for the entire Manhattan office market as of the end of February had risen above 9 percent. But vacancy rates are even higher in the most expensive top-notch buildings, known in the industry's jargon as Class A office space. The vacancy rate for Class A buildings in Midtown Manhattan has climbed to 10.6 percent, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
 Mr. Astrachan said that in times like these, tenants can often negotiate with landlords for concessions -- like long periods of free rent and capital improvement allowances -- if they are signing 5- to 10-year leases. 
 But tenants signing leases of one or two years cannot negotiate as many perks. ''They are slightly overpaying, in order to keep their flexibility,'' he said.
 Charlie Malet, the executive vice president in charge of national leasing for Shorenstein, a real estate company based in San Francisco, which owns several office buildings in Manhattan, said that short-term leases were attractive for both landlords and tenants now.
 ''Landlords don't want to tie up space for what they perceive to be a low rent,'' he said. ''And if the tenants are a little uncertain about the long-term business environment, they don't want to lock themselves into a 10-year deal.''
 Mr. Malet said that Shorenstein recently signed a one-year lease renewal with Harbor View Advisors, an investment advisory firm, at 850 Third Avenue. Shorenstein bought this 39-story, 1.2 million-square-foot office tower last summer. The price tag was around $325 million, according to Real Capital Analytics, a New York research firm that tracks sales of office buildings.
 Ken Perry, the chief investment officer and director of asset management for the Swig Company, a real estate concern in San Francisco, said the company had recently signed about half a dozen short-term leases at 1411 Broadway, one of several office towers it owns in Manhattan. Swig has had a 50 percent stake in this building since it was built in 1970, and is currently a co-owner with the Blackstone Group.
 ''This is the first time that I can remember when both landlords and tenants want to do short-term leases,'' Mr. Perry said.
 He said that usually one side or the other saw an advantage in this approach, depending on which direction rents were thought to be heading. ''But with all of this uncertainty in the markets, neither side wants to go long term.''

HEADLINE: As Hollywood Agencies Lose Clout, Two Are Said to Consider a Merger

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES and MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
For months, two of Hollywood's biggest talent agencies, Endeavor and William Morris, have quietly been talking merger. Endeavor has momentum, the William Morris Agency has depth, and a combined entity would challenge a leadership position long held by the dominant Creative Artists Agency.
 But the chatter here has been fixed instead on the retooled Oscar show and hopes that an unexpected box-office surge can offset the collapse in DVD sales. 
 Times have changed.
 In the last decade, writers, directors and actors have come to rely more heavily on managers at companies like Brillstein Entertainment Partners or Management 360, even as agencies have pursued corporate branding, digital ventures (sometimes with the agency as an owner) and both music and sports.
 Meanwhile, the rise of Web-based entertainment and the fall of star vehicles have created a group of entrepreneurial entertainers, like Tyra Banks and Ricky Gervais, who shoulder more responsibility for themselves. And studios, more powerful in a weak economy, are less inclined to dicker over terms. 
 In years past, agency maneuvers had Hollywood craning its neck to see who would be the winners and losers. But the response this time has been muted -- no media storm followed initial Web reports of the talks three weeks ago -- largely because the agency business has undergone such a drastic transformation in both power and role since the last big jolt.
 That occurred in 1999, when James A. Wiatt, then co-chief executive of International Creative Management, left to become co-chief and, later, chief executive of William Morris. Since then, Hollywood's Big Five -- Creative Artists, Endeavor, International Creative Management, the United Talent Agency and William Morris -- have spent less time wrestling with one another than with an industry that depends on them a little less, even as it demands that each of those companies do more.
 ''People don't seem particularly worked up over the volatility in the agency landscape,'' said Jon Liebman, the chief executive of Brillstein, which counts Brad Pitt, Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston among its clients. ''The agency waters are always choppy, and our job is to provide a constant.''
 Against the backdrop of such changes, Endeavor and William Morris edged closer to a merger last week, though significant snags remain, according to people with knowledge of the discussions who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. Spokesmen for Endeavor and William Morris said the agencies' leaders declined to comment.
 Flirtations have been frequent among the largest agencies in recent years, but have failed, almost always over issues related to ego and turf. In a series of interviews last summer, partners at Endeavor -- founded by four agents from I.C.M. in 1995 -- said they had at one time or another talked about combining with each of their big competitors. 
 The last meaningful combination on Hollywood's top tier occurred in 2006, when I.C.M. bought the much smaller Broder Webb Chervin Silbermann Agency, a move that shook up management and enhanced the bigger agency's television business.
 By many accounts, Endeavor is the No. 1 television agency, packaging shows like ''30 Rock'' and ''Gossip Girl,'' and it has a stable of marquee young movie stars that includes Shia LaBeouf and Amy Adams. William Morris, meanwhile, has a slumping TV department (with the exception of reality programming). And despite some hot names like Josh Brolin, some of William Morris's best-known movie stars, like Mel Gibson and Richard Gere, are past their prime. Yet William Morris has a blockbuster music unit -- Britney Spears and Kanye West are clients -- and lucrative corporate clients like Coca-Cola and Hasbro.
 Any deal would first have to be approved by the William Morris board and a seven-member executive committee at Endeavor. Both companies are private, and the precise balance of power inside each is not clear.
 At William Morris, Mr. Wiatt and his chief lieutenant, the agency president David Wirtschafter, together appear to control a substantial portion of the agency, if not an absolute majority of its votes.
 At Endeavor, Ariel Z. Emanuel, who dominates management but does not hold a title, has yet to hold what is expected to be an extended meeting with partners to explain the proposed merger.
 Endeavor's executive committee has four permanent members -- Mr. Emanuel, the motion picture talent agents Patrick Whitesell and Adam Venit and the television agent Rick Rosen -- and three additional members who are elected to two-year terms by the agency's 24 or so partners.
 Agents at both companies have been eager to hear details of a governance plan that many believe would put Mr. Wiatt in a chairmanlike position, leaving Mr. Emanuel, perhaps still without a title, with operating control of a company that presumably would have far fewer than the 1,000 or so employees currently working for the two combined.
 At Endeavor, Mr. Emanuel may face the additional burden of selling potentially skeptical partners and junior agents on the virtues of a combination that appears to threaten a carefully cultivated collegiality. Endeavor, just 14 years old, has a freewheeling culture, in stark contrast to the hierarchical William Morris, formed in 1898 to book vaudeville acts.
 While griping about unappreciative bosses has been rampant among William Morris underlings, one of Endeavor's founding partners, Tom Strickler, has cultivated internal good will with gifts as elaborate as reconstructive jaw surgery for one employee and an Argentine polo pony for another.
 If the merger happens and a new company is to emerge intact, more than a few past ruptures will have to be patched over. For instance, Mr. Emanuel, Mr. Strickler and Mr. Rosen would find themselves reunited with the same Mr. Wiatt who, as president of I.C.M., fired them in 1995 when they were caught cleaning out their offices in anticipation of founding Endeavor.
 That bit of intrigue led to public bitterness and some rough-and-tumble behavior from lawyers for both sides -- though no lawsuit. But that was then, and a reconciled Mr. Emanuel and Mr. Wiatt appear still to be talking, for now.

HEADLINE: 5 Years After It Halted Weapons Programs, Libya Sees the U.S. as Ungrateful

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, Libya 

 BODY:
When Libya gave up its nuclear and chemical weapons programs in late 2003, President George W. Bush pointed to the decision as a victory in Washington's so-called war on terror and as a potential model for pressing Iran and North Korea to give up their weapons programs, too. 
 But now Libyan officials say they are dissatisfied with the way the deal worked out, insisting that the United States has done too little to reward Libya's concessions. Officials here say they believe that Libya's limited payoff undermines the credibility of the United States as it presses other nations to abandon weapons programs. 
 Libya's discontent suggests potential hurdles for the Obama White House as it tries to engage with nations the United States has shunned, like Iran and Syria, as part of a broader strategy reassessment in the Middle East. 
 While Libya says it does not plan to restart the weapons programs, its disaffection signals the need to manage expectations and reveals the unexpected challenges of developing relations with the former pariah state, which has been isolated for decades and remains run by an eccentric, enigmatic strongman, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. 
 ''We gave some devices, some centrifuges, for example for America, but what do you give us? Nothing,'' said Abdelrahman Shalgham, who served as foreign minister for eight years before being named ambassador to the United Nations this month. ''That's why we think North Korea and Iran are hesitating now to have a breakthrough regarding their projects.''
 United States officials have said that in return for Libya's abandoning its unconventional-weapons programs and other concessions, they lifted economic sanctions and restored diplomatic ties, which were severed in 1980. The United States has opened an embassy in Libya, sent an ambassador to Tripoli and discussed military cooperation. Secretary of State Condoleezza Ricevisited Tripoli before leaving office.
 But Libyans at many levels of the government said that while they appreciated those gestures, they had been promised more, including civilian nuclear technology, some conventional weapons systems and help destroying chemical weapons. 
 They were also miffed at a recent State Department report that strongly criticized Libya's record on human rights, saying they expected that a friendly United States would play down the issue. 
 ''Bush responded well about his appreciation and said Libya should be an example to the world, but that's not enough -- that's not what they talked about,'' said Khaled Bazelya, a director with Libya's National Economic Development Board. ''You give something, you expect something in return; that's the Arab way. The expectation here is very high, but the West is not responding. We need a quicker response.'' 
 A senior Obama administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of Libyan-United States relations, said the Libyans ''were being unrealistic in their expectation for how quickly the relationship could improve.'' 
 The official said that if the ''Libyans carry on with good behavior, I think the possibilities for civilian nuclear cooperation will improve.'' The official said Libya could expect greater cooperation on technology sharing and the cleanup of chemical weapons stockpiles.
 Libya's complaints could be calculated, part of a negotiating tactic aimed at putting pressure on the new administration. Pentagon officials announced Friday that they would consider selling weapons systems to Libya. 
 Gaps in context and understanding, both cultural and political, can lead to long-term misunderstandings, often sabotaging diplomatic efforts. That is especially true with Libya, which is managed by a corps of bureaucrats who have limited international experience.
 One diplomat in Libya, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, said the government was shocked that the United States still criticized Libya's human rights record. Libya is a police state where security services operate with impunity and political opposition is not allowed.
 ''When you were enemies, we didn't care,'' the diplomat said after the State Department issued its latest human rights report this month. ''But now, you are supposed to be friends. We were surprised. There were 16 pages targeting Libya.'' 
 Since agreeing to give up his nuclear weapons program more than five years ago and taking responsibility for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, Colonel Qaddafi has tried to reintegrate Libya with the West. But the thaw in relations was not accompanied by any change in the authoritarian nature of Libya, which poses a problem for Western countries. 
 Getting closer to Libya, after all, means getting closer to the mercurial Colonel Qaddafi, who is known here as the Brother Leader.
 ''Dealing with Qaddafi is not easy because he is unpredictable,'' said Wahid Abdel Meguid, the deputy director of the Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, a research center in Cairo that is supported by the Egyptian government. 
 With his flamboyant desert robes, wraparound sunglasses and head of curly hair, Colonel Qaddafi has been eager to transform himself from rogue revolutionary leader to international statesman. That has been part of the program to reopen Libya to the world.
 He was recently named chairman of the African Union, and this month he appeared at a ceremony in Libya with the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. They announced final ratification of a treaty resolving the animosity stemming from Italy's colonial occupation of Libya. At the ceremony, Mr. Berlusconi offered an apology to the Libyan people and heaped praise on Colonel Qaddafi, inviting the man President Ronald Reagan once called a ''mad dog'' to attend the coming Group of 8 conference of advanced industrial democracies in Rome. The two men hugged.
 ''I don't know what to call him,'' Mr. Berlusconi said, smiling at Colonel Qaddafi, who was smiling back. ''He has so many titles: the Leader of the Revolution, King of Kings, Chairman of the African Union. And he deserves them and more.''
 As that leader, Colonel Qaddafi's personal interests, or animosities, can drive the nation's agenda. For months, Libya has been locked in a diplomatic fight with Switzerland, after the Swiss police arrested one of Colonel Qaddafi's sons, Hannibal, and his wife, Aline, on charges they had beaten two household workers during a visit to Geneva. 
 Immediately after the arrests, Libya pulled millions of dollars from Swiss bank accounts, ordered all Swiss businesses out of Libya, stopped selling oil to Switzerland, closed the Swiss cultural center, blocked Swiss ships from docking in Libyan ports and demanded that the police who detained Hannibal be punished, diplomats here said.
 Late last month, Libya rejected a Swiss proposal to resolve the dispute.

HEADLINE: United Technology Plans to Cut 11,600 Jobs

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
United Technologies, saying the downturn in its core markets is worse than expected, cut its 2009 profit forecast 13 percent Tuesday and said it would reduce its global work force by 5 percent. 
 The company, which makes Otis elevators, Sikorsky helicopters and other products, said the markets for commercial aerospace and global construction have worsened since December as worldwide construction and aerospace orders slowed.
 ''We intend to be fully prepared for a deeper and longer deterioration of market conditions,'' the chief executive, Louis R. Chenevert, told investor analysts at a conference in New York.
 The company lowered its 2009 profit forecast to $4 to $4.50 a share from its earlier outlook of $4.65 to $5.15 a share. That's a 13 percent cut from the midpoint of the range of each forecast.
 United Technologies said it expected to cut 11,600 jobs, 5 percent of its 223,100 workers worldwide, because of a deteriorating commercial aerospace market. The reductions bring to 18,000 the number of jobs cut this year and in 2008.
 The cuts will be in administrative and sales jobs, not in manufacturing.
 Shipments by the business jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney Canada, which last year were forecast to be up 20 percent in 2009, are now likely to be flat over 2008, Mr. Chenevert said.
 Meanwhile, the slowdown in global construction is pinching sales at its Otis elevator and Carrier heating, ventilating and air-conditioning equipment units.
 On Tuesday, United Technologies also lowered the amount it would spend on share repurchases this year by half, to $1 billion.
 Shares of United Technologies rose 8.6 percent Tuesday, or $3.23, to $40.79.

HEADLINE: The Upfront Season This Time Won't Be Too Upbeat

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
AS cable channels have made inroads on the broadcast networks, their share of the upfront advertising market has steadily grown. But this year's upfront, which starts this month, looks to be a protracted and potentially painful one. 
 The deepening recession is forcing advertisers to act more selectively, media buyers and sales executives say. The channels with the strongest brands and broadest reach may see more business, while niche channels may struggle to sign deals.
 During the upfront season for television, media buyers make advance commitments to secure certain placements for advertisements. Last year, dozens of cable channels collectively sold about $8 billion in advance ad time to advertisers, up 7 to 8 percent over the previous year. Broadcasters sold about $9 billion in ad time, up about 1 percentage point, meaning that cable gained some share of the available advertising dollars. 
 Shelley Watson, a senior vice president and the director of entertainment at the advertising and marketing agency RPA, said the coming upfronts are ''not going to be as robust as last year.'' She foresees a marketplace where supply is slightly up and demand is slightly down. ''I think it's at best flat,'' she said.
 As the trade publication Media Life Magazine put it last month in an assessment of the advertising climate, ''flat is the new booming.''
 Both buyers and sellers have characterized the market as cautious. ''Safety is going to matter in this marketplace. Certainty is going to matter,'' said Ed Erhardt, the president of customer marketing and sales for ESPN.
 Carolyn Everson, the executive vice president and chief operating officer for MTV Networks' advertising sales, said advertisers were in the process of gathering budgets. ''We know this year will be a tough market,'' she said. 
 The broadcast networks hold festive presentations of new programming for advertisers in New York each May. In part to enjoy their own days in the spotlight, many ad-supported cable channels hold their own upfront presentations before the broadcasters do. 
 Already, companies like MTV Networks, a division of Viacom, and Turner Broadcasting, a division of Time Warner, are in discussions with advertisers about new programming and marketing opportunities. On Thursday, Nickelodeon will be the host for media buyers at an upfront event; next Monday, Sci Fi will make upfront announcements; and the next week the Hallmark Channel will make a presentation.
 With its smaller audiences, cable usually sells time at a discount to broadcast time. Jeff Gaspin, the president of the Universal Television Group, calls it a ''great value'' for advertisers, especially given the quality of many of the scripted dramas and comedies on cable. Mr. Gaspin said that the season finale of ''Burn Notice,'' a USA series about spies, was one of the highest-rated dramas on any network last Thursday among 18- to 49-year-olds.
 ''When you have statistics like that, you're no longer talking about a reach in cable that doesn't compare to broadcast,'' he said. ''In some cases cable's better, because it's somewhat targeted.''
 Although individual broadcasters still draw the biggest audiences, viewers continue to move gradually to cable. For the first half of the 2008-9 TV season, the six broadcast networks averaged 40 million viewers, and the 76 ad-supported cable networks that are measured by Nielsen averaged 56 million viewers in prime time. During the same time period in the 2007-8 season, broadcast averaged 43 million viewers and cable averaged 51 million, according to RPA.
 To stand out, some cable channels coin new names for their target audiences. Last year MTV introduced the name ''Generation P'' for its young viewers, referencing a demographic that produces and programs their own media. This year IFC and the Sundance Channel, two film channels owned by Cablevision, are using the term ''indienomics'' to describe the spending habits of their affluent viewers.
 Other niche channels, meanwhile, are rebranding themselves in advance of the upfront season. Fine Living Network, a branch of Scripps, now calls itself FLN, for instance. And the Travel Channel recently introduced a campaign called ''Travel Bug'' that taps into viewers' desires to get away. 
 Niche cable channels may face a stiffer challenge this year, though. ''A lot of the advertisers I'm speaking to are going to look to do business with fewer networks,'' said Steve Mandala, the executive vice president for cable ad sales for NBC Universal. ''What they're looking for is networks that deliver scale as well as quality.'' 
 Mr. Erhardt agreed that the list of networks is ''going to be shorter. I think it's reflective of what's happening across all media,'' he said.
 For the second year Turner, which owns TNT and TBS, plans to hold its upfront presentation in May, the same week as most of the broadcast networks.
 A higher than usual number of advertisers have canceled some their upfront cable purchases this winter, taking advantage of the options they negotiate with sellers.
 Turner reported a 10 percent cancellation rate in the second quarter of the year, higher than the usual 6 percent rate.
 David Levy, the president of sales for Turner Broadcasting, said that was ''higher than in years past, but certainly not as high as it could have been.'' 
 Ms. Watson said companies were buying ad time in the year-round scatter market (a name for the unsold inventory after the upfront market ends) close to the broadcast dates. ''Clients want to make sure the money is really there,'' she said.
 MTV Networks, which includes Comedy Central, VH1 and others, drew attention last year for its emphasis on brand integration and new advertising formats. (Remember Stephen Colbert's enthusiastic endorsements of Doritos snack chips on Comedy Central?) Ms. Everson said the company was working on several large partnerships to create programming with advertisers.
 ''The line between programming time and commercial time is evaporating,'' she said. ''When we do our job right, it doesn't exist. Content that connects is content that connects.''

HEADLINE: Obama Outlines Plan for Education Overhaul

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama called for sweeping changes in American education on Tuesday, urging states to lift limits on charter schools and improve the quality of early childhood education while also signaling that he intends to make good on his campaign promise of linking teacher pay to performance.
 Having secured tens of billions of dollars in additional financing for education in the economic stimulus package and made clear his intent to seek more in his budget, Mr. Obama used a speech here to flesh out how he would use federal money and programs to influence policy at the state and local level. 
 His proposals reflected his party's belief that education at all levels was underfinanced in the Bush years and that reform should encompass more than demands that schools show improved test scores. But they also showed a willingness to challenge teachers' unions and public school systems, and to continue to demand more accountability.
 The president said it was time to erase limits on the number of charter schools, which his administration calls ''laboratories of innovation,'' while closing those that are not working. He said 26 states and the District of Columbia now had caps. Teachers' unions have opposed charter schools in some places, saying they take away financing for public schools, while supporting them in others. 
 Putting limits on charter schools, even in places where they are performing well, ''isn't good for our children, our economy or our country,'' Mr. Obama said. 
 In his recent budget message, he said that he hoped to double financing for charter schools eventually, another campaign promise, and that the Department of Education would help create ''new, high-quality charter schools'' while supporting the closing of those guilty of ''chronic underperformance.''
 He called on states to impose tougher curriculum standards, and in an echo of language often used by President George W. Bush, he chided states that he said were ''low-balling expectations for our kids.'' 
 Saying he would ''cultivate a new culture of accountability in America's schools,'' Mr. Obama said states and school districts should weed out bad teachers. 
 But he also pledged to pursue programs that would provide more incentives and support for teachers and indicated he would back a program in up to 150 school districts that would reward teachers ''with more money for improved student achievement.''
 The teacher-pay provision and his support for more charter schools could complicate Mr. Obama's ability to win support for his plan in Congress and in state legislatures, where teacher unions hold considerable sway with Democrats. 
 Mr. Obama acknowledged the partisan divisions about how to proceed, even as he appealed to all sides to compromise.
 ''For decades, Washington has been trapped in the same stale debates that have paralyzed progress and perpetuated our educational decline,'' Mr. Obama said, in a speech here to the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. ''Too many supporters of my party have resisted the idea of rewarding excellence in teaching with extra pay, even though we know it can make a difference in the classroom. Too many in the Republican Party have opposed new investments in early childhood education, despite compelling evidence of its importance.''
 Union leaders reacted cautiously to the speech. Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association, said his union's 3.2 million members ''welcome the vision'' laid out by the president.
 Randi Weingarten, president of the 1.4-million-member American Federation of Teachers, said her union embraced ''the goals and aspirations'' outlined by Mr. Obama. ''As with any public policy,'' Ms. Weingarten said, ''the devil is in the details, and it is important that teachers' voices are heard as we implement the president's vision.'' 
 While unions generally dislike linking pay to specific measures of performance like rising test scores, there have been some successful experiments around the country with plans that take account of performance, especially in districts where unions are deeply involved.
 The address on Tuesday was the first step in laying out the president's agenda to improve schools, officials said, with more specifics to be outlined to Congress soon. 
 Mr. Obama noted that the recently enacted stimulus package called for spending some $5 billion on the Early Head Start and Head Start programs -- an investment that he said would be rewarded by lower welfare rolls, fewer health care costs and less crime, as well as better classroom performance. He said he would ask Congress to finance a program that would provide grants to states that improve their early childhood programs.
 His speech elated advocates of charter schools. ''With 365,000 students on charter waiting lists, there is no excuse for state laws that stifle the growth of these schools,'' Nelson Smith, the president and chief executive of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Fed Chairman Calls for a Regulator to Rein In Entities 'Too Big to Fail'

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, called on Tuesday for a broad overhaul of financial regulation that would include a powerful new regulator to keep a much tighter grip on institutions considered ''too big to fail.''
 At the same time, Mr. Bernanke stoked a new controversy by endorsing more flexible accounting rules that would not force banks to book as many losses during an economic downturn as current rules require. 
 In so doing, the Fed chairman came closer than other top officials to supporting a policy known as ''regulatory forbearance,'' a phrase that became an epithet among policy makers after the savings and loan crisis of the early 1990s.
 Although the Fed chairman did not use that phrase, he called for reducing the ''pro-cyclical'' aspects of current regulation -- the tendency of accounting rules and capital requirements to aggravate both financial retrenchment during a slowdown and financial excesses during a boom.
 Investors and supporters of the banking industry cheered. The battered shares of Citigroup and other banks rose more than 20 percent, though part of that was in response to a statement by Citigroup's chief executive that the bank turned a profit in the first two months of this year.
 But some regulatory experts denounced Mr. Bernanke's proposals, saying they would merely give banks new ways to hide their true losses.
 ''If Bernanke thinks he can regulate the cyclicality out of banking, then he's a fool,'' said Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''If you're regulating banks and you're doing a good job, you're making sure that the banks are building their capital reserves during good times. The problem in this country has been that the regulators became captives of the banks and didn't require them to build up enough capital.''
 Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr. Bernanke said rigid capital requirements for banks may be encouraging them to cut back even further on lending during a recession than they would if they had more flexible requirements. That could slow down economic activity and add to the banks' problems. 
 ''We should review capital regulations to ensure that they are appropriately forward-looking, and that capital is allowed to serve its intended role as a buffer -- one built up during good times and drawn down during bad times,'' he said.
 The Fed chairman also said regulators should consider relaxing so-called mark-to-market accounting rules that require financial institutions to value securities in their portfolio on the basis of their current market price. Banks and Wall Street firms, which are holding vast quantities of mortgage-backed securities for which there is no market and hence no market price, have been lobbying intensely for months for relief from mark-to-market rules and other forms of flexibility.
 But many accounting and regulatory experts vehemently argue that such changes would make it easier for banks to hide their losses, thus increasing the overall level of uncertainty.
 The Fed chairman made it clear he sympathized with the banks, saying that the current rules might be aggravating the ups and downs of the financial system by forcing the banks to write down their investments more than necessary because the market for them had dried up.
 ''Determining appropriate valuation methods for illiquid or idiosyncratic assets can be very difficult, to put it mildly,'' Mr. Bernanke said, adding that ''further review'' of the current rules ''would be useful.''
 Responding to questions after his speech, Mr. Bernanke said he strongly supported the general principle that assets should be valued at current market prices. But, he added, the current rules did not lead to accurate valuations in times like these.
 ''Even the strongest proponents of mark to market acknowledge that in periods like this, when some markets don't even exist or are highly illiquid, that the numbers that come out can be misleading,'' he said. 
 In Congress, lawmakers are already beginning to draft legislation to overhaul the entire system of financial regulation, which experts say played a central role in the explosive growth of reckless mortgages and risk-taking by financial institutions during the housing bubble.
 The House Financial Services Committee has scheduled four hearings on the issue for later this month, and one of its subcommittees will hold a hearing on mark-to-market rules Thursday.
 Mr. Bernanke also took aim at the problem of very large institutions, like Citigroup and American International Group, that had become so big that their failures would have jeopardized the entire financial system. 
 Though he defended the government's decision to bail out such companies, he warned that the expectation of additional bailouts encouraged companies to take bigger risks and grow big enough to get protection.
 ''The belief of market participants that a particular firm is considered too big to fail has many undesirable effects,'' the Fed chairman said. ''Indeed, in the present crisis, the too-big-to-fail issue has emerged as an enormous problem.''
 Echoing proposals by some lawmakers, Mr. Bernanke called on Congress to create a superregulator that would oversee risks and risk-management practices across the financial system and have authority over companies regardless of whether they were banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies or hedge funds. 
 Stopping short of saying the Fed should become the superregulator as some have proposed, he said ''a good case'' could be made for putting the Fed in charge.

HEADLINE: Wanted: A New Tenant for the Rainbow Room

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
THE co-owners of Rockefeller Center have hired a restaurant consultant to find a new tenant for the Rainbow Room after the Cipriani organization's management of the storied space ends on July 31. 
 A spokeswoman for Tishman Speyer said the firm had hired Barry Wine to ''search for another great restaurateur who will operate the Rainbow Room in a manner befitting one of New York's most beloved and iconic institutions.'' The spokeswoman, Suzanne Halpin, said the firm wanted the space to ''house a world-class restaurant.'' She added that it had no intention of converting it to office space, as had been rumored.
 Mr. Wine would not discuss any of the potential candidates. ''I'm looking for the best operators in the world,'' he said. ''It should be that iconic John D. Rockefeller supper club with all the glamour, so New Yorkers can get dressed up and have a good time. But there is a lot more space than just the restaurant.''
 Few restaurants in New York are as celebratory as the Rainbow Room, perched on the 65th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, with its Art Deco chic, skyline views and revolving dance floor. 
 Michael Whiteman, whose company ran the Rainbow Room from 1987 until 1999, said he thought it would be hard in today's economy to find an operator for the complex, which includes other restaurants and party rooms on the 64th and 65th floors. Mr. Whiteman cited the high rent, reported to have been $6 million, and the added expense of running restaurants and catering with unionized employees. ''Private parties are more lucrative than a restaurant, and right now, luxury spending on lavish events has become vulgar,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Lack of Financing Scuttles Deal for Casino at Aqueduct

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Scratch those plans for the first casino on a subway line in New York City -- at least for now.
 Plans to build a casino at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens have collapsed, the latest victim of the financial turmoil that has tightened the credit markets. 
 Delaware North, the Buffalo company that was contracted to build and operate the casino, has not been able to get the financing to raise the $370 million it was to pay the state upfront, officials said. That leaves the state with yet another hole to plug in its ever-leakier budget. 
 ''Today we informed the governor's office that we are unable at this time to conclude a memorandum of understanding with the state to develop the Aqueduct facility,'' William Bissett, Delaware North's president, said in a statement. He added that ''there has been a deterioration of the credit and equity financial markets in this recession economy which has caused Aqueduct Gaming L.L.C. to restructure the timing for its financial offer.''
 The company had offered to proceed with the deal but delay its upfront payment; the state, however, was said to be concerned about a legal challenge if it allowed the winning bidder to alter the terms of its deal. 
 A spokesman for Gov. David A. Paterson expressed disappointment in the news from Delaware North, but said the state remains committed to Aqueduct's redevelopment. He said the state would reopen the bidding process to find an operator for a casino at the racetrack.
 In October, the Paterson administration announced that it had a deal in place with Delaware North to build an elaborate gambling complex at Aqueduct, appearing to end a nearly seven-year political battle over the project. The project was first pitched in 2003, during the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki, during a previous budget crunch, and it was also pursued by Gov. Eliot Spitzer. 
 The casino was to include a 184,000-square-foot gambling floor and 4,500 video gambling terminals as well as restaurants, a hotel and a 60,000-square-foot conference center. Construction was to have started early this year. Delaware North operates a similar casino in Saratoga Springs.
 Critics have said that the state should not turn to gambling to fill its coffers, particularly in a recession. But the lure for the state is clear: It expected to take in billions of dollars in revenue over the next few decades.
 A more immediate problem is replacing the $370 million that the state had expected to receive upfront. Now lawmakers will have to make due without that money three weeks before the end of the fiscal year and the state budget deadline. 
 ''We now have another hole to fill,'' said Assemblywoman Audrey I. Pheffer, a Queens Democrat whose district includes Aqueduct. 
 ''I'm very disappointed, I'm very upset, I'm really angry,'' she said, but added, ''I don't know who to blame.''
 Delaware North intends to stay with the process. It beat out two other bidders last year.
 Referring to the governor's office, Mr. Bissett said, ''While we disagree with their conclusion that a rebid is necessary, we nonetheless remain interested in developing Aqueduct and look forward to continue work with administration to achieve that goal.''

HEADLINE: The Looting Of America's Coffers

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Sixteen years ago, two economists published a research paper with a delightfully simple title: ''Looting.''
 The economists were George Akerlof, who would later win a Nobel Prize, and Paul Romer, the renowned expert on economic growth. In the paper, they argued that several financial crises in the 1980s, like the Texas real estate bust, had been the result of private investors taking advantage of the government. The investors had borrowed huge amounts of money, made big profits when times were good and then left the government holding the bag for their eventual (and predictable) losses. 
 In a word, the investors looted. Someone trying to make an honest profit, Professors Akerlof and Romer said, would have operated in a completely different manner. The investors displayed a ''total disregard for even the most basic principles of lending,'' failing to verify standard information about their borrowers or, in some cases, even to ask for that information. 
 The investors ''acted as if future losses were somebody else's problem,'' the economists wrote. ''They were right.'' 
 On Tuesday morning in Washington, Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, gave a speech that read like a sad coda to the ''Looting'' paper. Because the government is unwilling to let big, interconnected financial firms fail -- and because people at those firms knew it -- they engaged in what Mr. Bernanke called ''excessive risk-taking.'' To prevent such problems in the future, he called for tougher regulation. 
 Now, it would have been nice if the Fed had shown some of this regulatory zeal before the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. But that day has passed. So people are rightly starting to think about building a new, less vulnerable financial system.
 And ''Looting'' provides a really useful framework. The paper's message is that the promise of government bailouts isn't merely one aspect of the problem. It is the core problem. 
 Promised bailouts mean that anyone lending money to Wall Street -- ranging from small-time savers like you and me to the Chinese government -- doesn't have to worry about losing that money. The United States Treasury (which, in the end, is also you and me) will cover the losses. In fact, it has to cover the losses, to prevent a cascade of worldwide losses and panic that would make today's crisis look tame. 
 But the knowledge among lenders that their money will ultimately be returned, no matter what, clearly brings a terrible downside. It keeps the lenders from asking tough questions about how their money is being used. Looters -- savings and loans and Texas developers in the 1980s; the American International Group, Citigroup, Fannie Mae and the rest in this decade -- can then act as if their future losses are indeed somebody else's problem.
 Do you remember the mea culpa that Alan Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke's predecessor, delivered on Capitol Hill last fall? He said that he was ''in a state of shocked disbelief'' that ''the self-interest'' of Wall Street bankers hadn't prevented this mess.
 He shouldn't have been. The looting theory explains why his laissez-faire theory didn't hold up. The bankers were acting in their self-interest, after all. 
 The term that's used to describe this general problem, of course, is moral hazard. When people are protected from the consequences of risky behavior, they behave in a pretty risky fashion. Bankers can make long-shot investments, knowing that they will keep the profits if they succeed, while the taxpayers will cover the losses.
 This form of moral hazard -- when profits are privatized and losses are socialized -- certainly played a role in creating the current mess. But when I spoke with Mr. Romer on Tuesday, he was careful to make a distinction between classic moral hazard and looting. It's an important distinction.
 With moral hazard, bankers are making real wagers. If those wagers pay off, the government has no role in the transaction. With looting, the government's involvement is crucial to the whole enterprise.
 Think about the so-called liars' loans from recent years: like those Texas real estate loans from the 1980s, they never had a chance of paying off. Sure, they would deliver big profits for a while, so long as the bubble kept inflating. But when they inevitably imploded, the losses would overwhelm the gains. As Gretchen Morgenson has reported, Merrill Lynch's losses from the last two years wiped out its profits from the previous decade. 
 What happened? Banks borrowed money from lenders around the world. The bankers then kept a big chunk of that money for themselves, calling it ''management fees'' or ''performance bonuses.'' Once the investments were exposed as hopeless, the lenders -- ordinary savers, foreign countries, other banks, you name it -- were repaid with government bailouts.
 In effect, the bankers had siphoned off this bailout money in advance, years before the government had spent it.
 I understand this chain of events sounds a bit like a conspiracy. And in some cases, it surely was. Some A.I.G. employees, to take one example, had to have understood what their credit derivative division in London was doing. But more innocent optimism probably played a role, too. The human mind has a tremendous ability to rationalize, and the possibility of making millions of dollars invites some hard-core rationalization. 
 Either way, the bottom line is the same: given an incentive to loot, Wall Street did so. ''If you think of the financial system as a whole,'' Mr. Romer said, ''it actually has an incentive to trigger the rare occasions in which tens or hundreds of billions of dollars come flowing out of the Treasury.'' 
 Unfortunately, we can't very well stop the flow of that money now. The bankers have already walked away with their profits (though many more of them deserve a subpoena to a Congressional hearing room). Allowing A.I.G. to collapse, out of spite, could cause a financial shock bigger than the one that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Modern economies can't function without credit, which means the financial system needs to be bailed out.
 But the future also requires the kind of overhaul that Mr. Bernanke has begun to sketch out. Firms will have to be monitored much more seriously than they were during the Greenspan era. They can't be allowed to shop around for the regulatory agency that least understands what they're doing. The biggest Wall Street paydays should be held in escrow until it's clear they weren't based on fictional profits.
 Above all, as Mr. Romer says, the federal government needs the power and the will to take over a firm as soon as its potential losses exceed its assets. Anything short of that is an invitation to loot. 
 Mr. Bernanke actually took a step in this direction on Tuesday. He said the government ''needs improved tools to allow the orderly resolution of a systemically important nonbank financial firm.'' In layman's terms, he was asking for a clearer legal path to nationalization.
 At a time like this, when trust in financial markets is so scant, it may be hard to imagine that looting will ever be a problem again. But it will be. If we don't get rid of the incentive to loot, the only question is what form the next round of looting will take.
 Mr. Akerlof and Mr. Romer finished writing their paper in the early 1990s, when the economy was still suffering a hangover from the excesses of the 1980s. But Mr. Akerlof told Mr. Romer -- a skeptical Mr. Romer, as heacknowledged with a laugh on Tuesday -- that the next candidate for looting already seemed to be taking shape.
 It was an obscure little market called credit derivatives.

HEADLINE: Mr. Obama's Trade Agenda

 BODY:
In tough times, there is a strong temptation to turn inward. With so many Americans already out of work, why shouldn't the country raise trade barriers to protect its workers from foreign competition? 
 The answer is clear: Trade will play an important role in the world's eventual recovery, transmitting economic growth from one country to the next. Protectionism leads to further protectionism, and yielding to its temptation could unleash destructive trade wars that would crush any chance of recovery. 
 Unfortunately, few politicians are willing to tell their constituents that unpopular truth. Instead, governments are succumbing to protectionism's dangerous lure. In recent months, Russia has jacked up import barriers on cars, farm machinery and other products. The European Union has reintroduced subsidies on dairy products. Europe, India and Brazil raised tariffs on imported steel. 
 Protectionism is also taking subtler forms, like Britain's requirement that bailed-out banks favor domestic lending. The United States is not immune. The stimulus bill had a ''Buy America'' provision, and it made it more difficult for companies receiving stimulus dollars to hire foreign workers under the H-1B visa program. 
 President Obama's choice for United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, appears ambivalent about the value of free trade. As part of his confirmation hearings this week, Mr. Kirk testified that he would work to expand trade but also argued ''that not all Americans are winning from it and that our trading partners are not always playing by the rules.'' He suggested that the administration could press ahead on the ratification of the trade agreement with Panama, which was negotiated by the Bush administration. But he said that Mr. Obama was prepared to walk away from the Bush administration's agreement with South Korea, calling it ''unfair.'' 
 Mr. Obama's annual trade report to Congress is similarly worrisome. It suggested opening a ''discourse with the public'' on whether the trade agreements awaiting ratification -- with Colombia, South Korea and Panama -- are a good idea. It committed the administration to ''improving'' the North American Free Trade Agreement, without saying how. And it poured cold water on efforts to restart the World Trade Organization's round of international negotiations. 
 Those talks, which were supposed to open markets for the world's poorest countries, are flawed. Still, the administration's argument that negotiations are imbalanced because it is not clear what they offer to the United States is wrongheaded. The administration should press ahead on a deal and try to revive at least some of its original intent. 
 If ever there was a need for collective action -- on fiscal stimuli, monetary policy, aid to the developing world, fighting protectionism -- it is now. A place to start the rethinking is China and how to encourage increased domestic consumption and investment in China and other cash-rich Asian countries so they can start pulling the world out of recession. 
 China's leaders, in particular, need to understand that export-led growth no longer works for them or for the world. The United States will have more influence if it stops beating on Beijing for its foreign-exchange policy and engages China's leaders as partners, not rivals. 
 Vigorous trade will help the world recover. For that to happen, the United States will have to provide strong leadership and a clear commitment to fighting protectionism. Any sign of ambivalence from Washington will only make things worse.

HEADLINE: United Technologies Reduces Its 2009 Profit Forecast

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
United Technologies, saying the downturn in its core markets is worse than expected, cut its 2009 profit forecast 13 percent Tuesday and said it would reduce its global work force by 5 percent. 
 The company, which makes Otis elevators, Sikorsky helicopters and other products, said the markets for commercial aerospace and global construction have worsened since December as worldwide construction and aerospace orders slowed.
 ''We intend to be fully prepared for a deeper and longer deterioration of market conditions,'' the chief executive, Louis R. Chenevert, told investor analysts at a conference in New York.
 The company lowered its 2009 profit forecast to $4 to $4.50 a share from its earlier outlook of $4.65 to $5.15 a share. That's a 13 percent cut from the midpoint of the range of each forecast.
 United Technologies said it expected to cut 11,600 jobs, 5 percent of its 223,100 workers worldwide, because of a deteriorating commercial aerospace market. The reductions bring to 18,000 the number of jobs cut this year and in 2008.
 The cuts will be in administrative and sales jobs, not in manufacturing.
 Shipments by the business jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney Canada, which last year were forecast to be up 20 percent in 2009, are now likely to be flat over 2008, Mr. Chenevert said.
 Meanwhile, the slowdown in global construction is pinching sales at its Otis elevator and Carrier heating, ventilating and air-conditioning equipment units.
 On Tuesday, United Technologies also lowered the amount it would spend on share repurchases this year by half, to $1 billion.
 Shares of United Technologies rose 8.6 percent Tuesday, or $3.23, to $40.79.

HEADLINE: A Little Nip and a Toast, Before Revisiting a Recession-Proof Songbook

BYLINE: By JON CARAMANICA

 BODY:
A few songs in to his set at B. B. King Blues Club & Grill on Tuesday night Busta Rhymes proposed a toast, pouring himself a little nip from a bottle of Courvoisier. He wanted to celebrate the election of President Obama and also the resurgence of New York as a relevant hip-hop scene. ''I know it's a recession,'' he said. ''If you don't have a drink, put your imaginary drink up.'' He was greeted by as many empty hands as full ones, maybe more.
For well over a decade Busta Rhymes has been remarkably recession-proof, outlasting dozens of artists he has collaborated with by being resilient, flexible and stylistically agnostic -- there's no sound he has thumbed his nose at. Many of his most notable songs aren't even his own; they're guest verses on other people's records. It helps, if you seek longevity, to have no apparent need for superstardom. 
His entertaining start-stop tour through his catalog on Tuesday covered more than 20 songs and skipped plenty of great ones. But what he performed was a testament to versatility: songs that emphasize his Jamaican heritage, ''Make It Clap'' and ''Uh Ooh (remix)''; roughneck anthems, ''Ante Up (remix),'' on which he was joined by the rowdy M.O.P.; collaborations with Mariah Carey, ''I Know What You Want,'' with Ms. Carey sadly absent. Nothing from his early days with Leaders of the New School, though.
If Busta Rhymes has had a signature sound, it was the digital bounce he perfected at midcareer -- ''Woo Hah!! Got You All in Check,'' ''Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See'' -- party records that also featured impressive, if monotone, vocal calisthenics.
Calisthenics he wanted the crowd here to take note of. On ''Break Ya Neck'' he repeated his rhymes three times in case people weren't paying attention. And that was just one of several old showman gimmicks he employed. He and his longtime hype man Spliff Star formed a charming comic duo, like two students in an improv workshop cooking up scenes: dance routines, exaggerated facial expressions, funny voices. During ''Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See,'' Busta Rhymes went from loud to soft and back while Spliff Star mimed turning a key next to his mouth, as if manually adjusting the volume.
Several guests joined Busta Rhymes throughout the night: M.O.P.; the dancehall star Beenie Man; and a trio of young Brooklyn rappers, the brawny Maino, the grim Uncle Murda, the surprisingly catchy Red Cafe. They all came back out at the end of the show to form a united front during the glorious, tacky ''Arab Money,'' which was a minor hit for Busta Rhymes late last year (with an accompanying dance), and is almost certainly the only rap song to ever mention the billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal al-Saud.
They were joined by its producer, Ron Browz, who sang the song's nonsensical, fake-Arabic hook and wore not one but two diamond-encrusted chains that read ''Ether Boy,'' the name of his record label. (He had opened the show with a set that was short, clunky and mercifully steamrolled by a guest appearance from Juelz Santana.)
Earlier Busta Rhymes had gathered the young Brooklyn rappers together at center stage -- a grouping he referred to as the Conglomerate, after his recent single -- and proclaimed a new era for New York hip-hop. He has played with so many teams, so why not this one?
''We're going to start repping this city right,'' he said, boasting that all the rappers would appear in one another's videos as a show of support, and promising ''a lot of cars, a lot of money, a lot of jewelry.'' Later he sprayed Champagne over the crowd as if it were still the late Clinton era. For a minute, at least, there was no recession to speak of.

HEADLINE: STOCKS & BONDS Markets Cling to Gains From Day Before

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
As Wall Street has demonstrated this year, a one-day surge is no great feat. The hard part is keeping the gains from slipping away.
On Wednesday, financial markets managed -- just barely -- to stay in positive territory after their biggest one-day rally of the year. 
Until now, nearly every day of gains this year had been followed by a day of losses as financial markets gyrated in response to the deepening recession, the stimulus package and Washington's plans to stabilize the banking system. In 2009, the Dow has closed higher on two or more consecutive days only four times.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 3.91 points, or 0.06 percent, to close at 6,930.40, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.76 points, or 0.24 percent, to 721.36. The Nasdaq added 13.36 points, to 1,371.64.
Even though the day's gains paled in comparison to the 379-point rally in the Dow on Tuesday, some market specialists were heartened that Wall Street had avoided backsliding as investors refocused on the dire state of the economy and the financial system.
''Up to this date, you would have seen the immediate giveback of everything,'' said William Smith, president of Smith Asset Management. ''The trick is whether we can hold onto the gains.''
Battered banking stocks, which rebounded on Tuesday after Citigroup offered a rare note of optimism, led the gains on Wednesday.
JPMorgan Chase rose 4.6 percent, to $20.40 a share. The bank's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said on CNBC that he was optimistic about the bank and that the first quarter had been profitable so far.
Companies that produce basic materials like metals and chemicals gained ground while health care shares fell.
Market specialists warned that it was far too soon to call a bottom to the wrenching declines in stock markets. Financial markets rallied in late December only to fall back, starting a slide to the lowest levels in 12 years. Even with the gains made Tuesday, the Dow and S.& P. 500 are still down about 20 percent for the year.
''Nothing's changed that much fundamentally day to day,'' said Scott Black, president of Delphi Management. ''You've still got a lot of toxic assets out there, and with these big banks, it's not just the residential mortgages, but the commercial mortgages and credit cards.''
Emphasizing the widespread economic declines, the Labor Department reported that unemployment rates in four states rose above 10 percent in January. The unemployment rate in Michigan, at 11.6 percent, was the highest in the country, while Wyoming's rate of 3.7 percent was the lowest.
Crude oil fell $3.38 a barrel, to settle at $42.33, after the Energy Department reported that crude stockpiles rose more than expected. Oil inventories have grown in recent months as demand for gasoline and petroleum products falls amid the deepening downturn.
Energy stocks including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Sunoco closed lower.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 27/32, to 98 21/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 2.90 percent, from 3.0 percent late Tuesday.
Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of 10-year notes:

EL SALVADOR'S BITTER PAST
Haunts Its Presidential Election
Vitriol stemming from El Salvador's 12-year civil war has created a vicious presidential campaign, analysts say. The right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance, known as Arena, is linking the left-wing Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or F.M.L.N., to President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela in frequent television advertisements.

CITIES' PLANS TO SWAP CASH FOR STIMULUS ARE STOPPED
Because many cities in Los Angeles County, Calif., did not have projects that qualified for money from the federal stimulus bill, the county's transit authority encouraged cities to swap the stimulus money at a discounted rate with other cities for cash. Eventually, the authority had to scratch the plan when they were informed that swapping the money would be illegal. PAGE A15

A growing number of economic analysts say the Continent is underestimating the perils of the dismal global economy. Leaders in Europe have so far been unwilling to ante up a United States-size stimulus package.

HEADLINE: As Cities Go From Two Newspapers to One, Some Talk of Zero

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
The history of The Seattle Post-Intelligencer stretches back more than two decades before Washington became a state, but after 146 years of publishing, the paper is expected to print its last issue next week, perhaps surviving only in a much smaller online version.
And it is not alone. The Rocky Mountain News shut down two weeks ago, and The Tucson Citizen is expected to fold next week.
At least Denver, Seattle and Tucson still have daily papers. But now, some economists and newspaper executives say it is only a matter of time -- and probably not much time at that -- before some major American city is left with no prominent local newspaper at all.
''In 2009 and 2010, all the two-newspaper markets will become one-newspaper markets, and you will start to see one-newspaper markets become no-newspaper markets,'' said Mike Simonton, a senior director at Fitch Ratings, who analyzes the industry. 
Many critics and competitors of newspapers -- including online start-ups that have been hailed as the future of journalism -- say that no one should welcome their demise.
''It would be a terrible thing for any city for the dominant paper to go under, because that's who does the bulk of the serious reporting,'' said Joel Kramer, former editor and publisher of The Star Tribune and now the editor and chief executive of MinnPost .com, an online news organization in Minneapolis.
''Places like us would spring up,'' he said, ''but they wouldn't be nearly as big. We can tweak the papers and compete with them, but we can't replace them.''
No one knows which will be the first big city without a large paper, but there are candidates all across the country. The Hearst Corporation, which owns The Post-Intelligencer, has also threatened to close The San Francisco Chronicle, which lost more than $1 million a week last year, unless it can wring significant savings from the operation.
In a tentative deal reached Tuesday night, the California Media Workers Guild agreed to less vacation time, longer workweeks and more flexibility for The Chronicle to make layoffs without regard to seniority. Union officials say they have been told to expect the elimination of at least 150 guild jobs, almost one-third of the total, and management is still trying to negotiate concessions from the Teamsters union.
Advance Publications said last fall that it might shut down The Star-Ledger, the dominant paper in New Jersey, but a set of cutbacks and union concessions kept the paper alive in much-downsized form.
The top papers in many markets, like The Philadelphia Inquirer and The New Haven Register, belong to companies that have gone into bankruptcy in the last three months.
The owners insist they have no intention of closing publications, but the management making those assurances may not be in charge when the companies emerge from reorganization.
Other publishers, like the Seattle Times Company and MediaNews Group, owner of The Denver Post, The San Jose Mercury News and The Detroit News, are seen as being at risk of bankruptcy. Many newspapers -- from The Miami Herald to The Chicago Sun-Times -- have been put up for sale, with no buyers on the horizon.
Ad revenue, the industry's lifeblood, has dropped about 25 percent in the last two years (by comparison, automotive revenue for Detroit's Big Three fell about 15 percent during the same period, although it has accelerated recently), and that slide, accelerated by the recession, shows no sign of leveling off in 2009.
Web sites like Craigslist have been to classified ads what the internal combustion engine was to horse-drawn buggies. The stock prices of most newspaper publishers have dropped more than 90 percent from their peaks.
And magnifying the problem, for many chains, is a heavy burden of debt that they took on, mostly in a spree of buying other newspapers from 2005 to 2007, just before the bottom dropped out of the business.
The Tribune Company, for instance, owner of The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and other papers, filed for bankruptcy in December, largely because of its debt load. The reality is that even though the economic climate is hard for newspapers, without their debt payments the publishers in bankruptcy would still make money, as do most newspapers around the country.
But profits are shrinking fast; taken together, major chains had an operating profit margin of about 10 percent in 2008, down from more than 20 percent as recently as 2004, according to research by John Morton, an independent analyst.
The recent closures and threatened closures point to an ominous new trend. For The Chronicle, The Rocky, The Star-Ledger, The Citizen and others, debt was never the problem and they belonged to solvent companies, but still they have been losing money.
Analysts say that many other major papers have also slid into red ink recently, including The Washington Post and The Boston Globe (which is owned by The New York Times Company).
The steady trickle of downsizing that sapped American papers for almost a decade has become a flood in the last few years. The Los Angeles Times still has one of the largest news staffs in the country, about 600 people, but it was twice as big in the late 1990s. The Washington Post had a newsroom of more than 900 six years ago, and has fewer than 700 now. The Gannett Company, the largest newspaper publisher in the country, eliminated more than 8,300 jobs in 2007 and 2008, or 22 percent of the total.
On Wednesday, The Miami Herald, once the celebrated flagship of the Knight Ridder chain, said it would trim an additional 19 percent of its already diminished staff.
Nearly every large paper in the country prints fewer pages and fewer articles, and many have eliminated entire sections. Bureaus in foreign capitals and even Washington have closed, and papers have jettisoned film criticism, book reviews and coverage of local news outside their home markets.
Many papers are sharing coverage with former competitors in an effort to save money. (The New York Times has also suffered from declining revenue, but has been able to avoid serious newsroom cuts so far.)
For more than two centuries, newspapers have been the indispensable source of public information and a check on the abuses of government and other powerful interests. And they still reach a vast and growing audience. Daily print circulation has dropped from a peak of 62 million two decades ago to around 49 million, and online readership has risen faster, to almost 75 million Americans and 3.7 billion page views in January, according to Nielsen Online.
But no one yet has unlocked the puzzle of supporting a large newsroom purely on digital revenue, a fact that may presage an era of news organizations that are smaller, weaker and less able to fulfill their traditional function as the nation's watchdog.
''I can't imagine what civil society would be like,'' said Buzz Woolley, a wealthy San Diego businessman who has been a vocal critic of the paper there, The Union-Tribune, and the primary backer of an Internet news site, VoiceofSanDiego.org. ''I don't want to imagine it. A huge amount of information would just never get out.''
Not everyone agrees. The death of a newspaper should result in an explosion of much smaller news sources online, producing at least as much coverage as the paper did, says Jeff Jarvis, director of interactive journalism at the City University of New York's graduate journalism school. Those sources might be less polished, Mr. Jarvis said, but they would be competitive, ending the monopolies many newspapers have long enjoyed.
A number of money-losing papers should ''have the guts to shut down print and go online,'' he said. ''It will have to be a much smaller product, but that's where we're headed anyway.''
Industry executives who once scoffed at the idea of an Internet-only product now concede that they are probably headed in that direction, but the consensus is that newspapers going all digital would become drastically smaller news sources for the foreseeable future.
Until then, papers have turned to measures that would have been unthinkable just a year or two ago, including many that are weighing whether to begin charging readers for online access, as The Wall Street Journal does.
Starting March 30, the major Detroit papers, The Free Press and The News, will deliver to subscribers only three days a week, to save money on printing and trucking. The Christian Science Monitor will print its last daily edition on March 27, becoming primarily an online operation, with a printed weekly paper.
''It's not so much that everyone has a great plan,'' said John Yemma, editor of The Monitor. Rather, he said, ''everybody is so desperate, they're looking at every possibility.''
Correction: March 13, 2009, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the acceleration of newspaper shutdowns in major American cities referred incorrectly to the bankruptcy filing affecting The Star Tribune in Minneapolis. The newspaper filed for bankruptcy protection -- not the private equity group Avista Capital Partners, which owns the paper. The error was repeated in a picture caption with the continuation of the article.

HEADLINE: Some Great Seats Still Available at Citi Field

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
With just a month to go before the first regular-season game at Citi Field, the Mets are doing all they can to sign up season-ticket holders, including offering prospective customers tours of the stadium. 
 Thus far, a healthy number of fans seem willing to visit the unfinished park to look at seats. It is unclear, though, how many of them are committing to ticket plans, particularly in the most expensive sections.
 On Wednesday afternoon, tours were running a half-hour late because the team did not have enough hard hats for visitors to wear. About two dozen fans, some wearing team jerseys and hats, were left to mill around a third-floor lobby.
 Groups of about six customers were eventually led to the Caesars Club. The room was set up for a presentation to bartenders and food-service workers who were going to see a slide show that included one slide on ''the benefits of serving food fast.''
 Ticket agents were friendly, but not pushy. They took fans to whatever sections they wanted to see and did not ask for any commitments at the end of the tour. One guide was reluctant to say how much a luxury suite cost on a per-game basis.
 A reporter on one tour saw many groups visiting the upper deck, and a few in the middle decks and outfield sections, but none in the more expensive lower bowl. The search for cheaper seats is consistent with the sale of single-game tickets on Mets.com for games in April and May. For games against the Nationals in April, there are plenty of field-level seats for $180 and a sprinkling of upper-deck outfield seats for $15, but fewer in between.
 ''We've been saying that price is certainly an issue, and our customers are shopping price, and that is attributable to the economy,'' said Dave Howard, the team's executive vice president for business operations.
 The Mets are not alone in trying to find buyers for their expensive seats. The Yankees hired a division of a Manhattan residential real estate brokerage, Prudential Douglas Elliman, to help sell some of their unsold premium seats and luxury boxes at the new Yankee Stadium. Those seats cost $350 to $2,500 a game.
 The Mets sold out their two exhibition games with the Boston Red Sox in less than an hour. Another baseball game between St. John's and Georgetown, with tickets at $5 each, sold out as quickly.
 The Mets have sold the equivalent of nearly 25,000 full season-ticket packages and another 500,000 tickets in partial packages, about 70 percent of available seats. The Saturday and weekday 15-game packages are sold out, and the Sunday packages are nearly gone.
 Seats in the Sterling Level and Field Level run as high as $18,325 each for a season ticket. The cheapest season tickets on the field level are $4,080. The Excelsior Level one deck above starts at $3,264 a seat and runs as high as $14,275 a seat.
 In the lobby, the former Mets first baseman Ed Kranepool was seen talking with a receptionist. Asked if he expected his number to be retired some day, he said with a chuckle that because it was not retired at Shea Stadium, where he played from 1964 until 1979, there was no reason to expect it would happen in the Mets' new home.

HEADLINE: A Musical Rebel, Reformed ... or Maybe Not Quite

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
As a conductor, Pierre Boulez the modernist composer never goes off duty. Many conductors seem driven by an obligation to convey the mind-set and sound world of the pieces they perform. But when Mr. Boulez conducts, typically, he is seized with a desire to show exactly what it is in the piece he has chosen that intrigues him as a composer. (Or provokes him, as the case may be.) So it was on Monday and Tuesday nights at Carnegie Hall, when Mr. Boulez conducted engrossing if sometimes perplexing programs with the mighty Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
 By opening Monday's program with Janacek's Sinfonietta and concluding Tuesday's with two Varese scores, Mr. Boulez may have been trying to shake up assumptions about music from the 1920s. Today Janacek, who died in 1928, is embraced as an opera composer of extraordinary musical and dramatic inventiveness. But he is still seen as a Czech nationalist who worked apart from the radical currents of the early 20th century. 
 Mr. Boulez's performance of the Sinfonietta, an ambitious work of 25 minutes in five contrasting movements, conveyed all the daring strangeness of this music. Yes, the piece begins and ends with a fanfare flourish from a battery of 12 trumpets and percussion. But listen closely, as Mr. Boulez's performance compelled you to do, and you hear how the trumpet lines slink through chromatic harmonies and how brass riffs get stuck in place. 
 The radicalism of the music comes from its abrupt discontinuities: passages of thick, buzzing chords for high strings give way to fleeting bucolic episodes for mellow winds and low strings; elegiac themes start to lull you, until you realize how weirdly asymmetrical the phrases are. 
 On Tuesday Mr. Boulez turned to a true renegade, the Paris-born Varese, who arrived in America in 1915 as an autocratic, shaggy-haired, self-proclaimed messiah of modernism. Yet Mr. Boulez had two raucously hard-core Varese scores sounding infectiously exuberant, almost festive. For all its rawness ''Ionisation,'' an eight-minute work for some three dozen percussion instruments, came across like an exhilarating jam session. And in ''Ameriques,'' a 20-plus-minute din of abrasively dissonant harmony, fractured melodic bits and brutally gnashing orchestra noise, driven by sledgehammer rhythms and wailing sirens, Mr. Boulez embraced the glorious craziness of the music. 
 His affinities as a composer, however, were even more apparent in Stravinsky works that he conducted. Back in his days as a rebellious young composer in Paris, Mr. Boulez and his cohort disrupted performances of Stravinsky's Neo-Classical works with jeers. For decades he kept debunking this period of Stravinsky's work.
 Yet over time he mellowed, and in the last 20 years he has given insightful performances of the very scores he once disdained. On Tuesday his intriguing take on Stravinsky's Symphony in Three Movements, composed during the early 1940s, came through. Mr. Boulez de-emphasized the propulsive drive of the piece and brought out its lush orchestral bigness. Multilayered voices were exposed; French-influenced colorings were highlighted, along with every bit of pungent harmonic modernity. 
 But his rather listless account of Stravinsky's complete ''Pulcinella'' ballet score, performed with the original songs, made me wonder whether Mr. Boulez retained a lingering antipathy to Stravinsky's Neo-Classicism after all. This is the ultimate Neo-Classical score, with Stravinsky actually refashioning songs, arias and short pieces by Italian Baroque composers, Pergolesi among them. There was a fine trio of vocal soloists: Roxana Constantinescu (mezzo-soprano), Nicholas Phan (tenor) and Kyle Ketelsen (bass-baritone). But this was a curiously stodgy and blurry performance.
 The brilliant violinist Frank Peter Zimmermann was the dynamic soloist on Monday for a rapturously colorful and sweeping account of Karol Szymanowski's 1916 Violin Concerto No. 1. This organic, lushly orchestrated one-movement work begins like a Polish ''Petrouchka'' and reveals the composer's distinctive way of blending Eastern exotica with Parisian Impressionism. 
 Elliott Carter, still out and about at 100, was on hand on Tuesday for Mr. Boulez's performance of his kaleidoscopic, restless and mysterious ''Reflexions,'' a short but polyphonically jampacked piece Mr. Carter wrote in 2004 in tribute to Mr. Boulez on his 80th birthday. Now here was a piece that Mr. Boulez conducted with self-effacing devotion and no agenda. The Chicago Symphony musicians played it brilliantly. 
 The orchestra sounds terrific, but Carnegie Hall, usually packed for Chicago Symphony concerts, had a noticeable number of empty seats. Perhaps Mr. Boulez's programming was a factor, though it could have been the worrisome economy.

HEADLINE: U.A.W. Deal Cuts Workers To $55 an Hour, Ford Says

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Ford Motor said Wednesday that its new agreement with the United Automobile Workers union would save at least $500 million a year and, within several years, bring its labor costs into line with what foreign competitors pay their workers in the United States. 
 Ford said the deal, which U.A.W. members ratified this week, immediately reduces its ''all-in'' hourly rate, which includes benefits, to $55. 
 It said the figure would continue to decline as more workers took buyouts and as the new-vehicle market recovered, allowing increased production.
 Ford's labor costs now amount to a little more than $60 an hour, including health care for retirees. Labor costs for the so-called transplant automakers, including Toyota and Honda, have been about $49 an hour in the United States and are rising, Ford estimates.
 ''This gets us within the ballpark of where the transplants are,'' Joseph R. Hinrichs, Ford's group vice president for global manufacturing and labor affairs, said. ''With the buyouts and with the ability to leverage some of the other tools that are in this agreement, we think we can get there in the next couple of years, on parity with the transplants.''
 That would be a watershed moment for the union, which fought for decades to ensure that its workers set the standard for pay and benefits in the auto industry.
 ''Wages are being set in Georgetown, not Detroit,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California, Berkeley, referring to Toyota's huge assembly plant in Georgetown, Ky., which the U.A.W. has not been able to organize.
 Ford is the only Detroit automaker not borrowing money from the federal government. General Motors and Chrysler have received $17.4 billion since December and want a total of $39 billion.
 Both G.M.and Chrysler have reached concessionary deals with the U.A.W. on most issues but are still negotiating on retiree health care. 
 A Chrysler vice chairman, Thomas W. LaSorda, warned on Wednesday that the company may close its plants in Canada unless it got sufficient labor concessions. In testimony in Canada, he also asked for government aid and resolution of a tax dispute.
 A U.A.W. vice president, Cal Rapson, said in a letter to local union leaders that economic changes in the G.M. contract followed the pattern of the U.A.W.-Ford agreement but that in other aspects they were ''drastically different.'' 
 Mr. Hinrichs called the agreement, which was supported by 59 percent of U.A.W. members who voted in recent weeks, ''critical to our future competitiveness.''
 It suspends inflation-related pay increases and performance bonuses, allows Ford to save as much as $6.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Times Are Tough on Wall Street and Wisteria Lane

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Full-time moms are being forced to take part-time jobs, and corporate executives treat themselves to expensive wine after asking for a government bailout. Foreclosure signs are going up in the most familiar neighborhoods. Three neighbors, laid off and their houses foreclosed upon, take the chief executive of their mortgage company hostage, and out-of-work investment bankers have to stoop to low-level jobs as corporate interns. 
 The economic meltdown has come to prime time. While each of those situations seems real enough to have resulted from the global financial crisis, they are plotlines of recent or coming episodes of popular prime-time television series, including ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Ugly Betty'' on ABC, ''The Simpsons'' on Fox, ''Flashpoint'' on CBS and ''30 Rock'' on NBC. 
 Popular entertainment often takes the form of escapism in tough economic times. But a growing number of broadcast network shows have recently incorporated more real-life issues into their stories -- a reflection, producers say, of how widespread the current financial troubles are. 
 ''If everyone in America is thinking about it, that means every writer in Hollywood is thinking about it,'' said Marc Cherry, the creator and executive producer of ''Desperate Housewives.'' ''I know people tune in to 'Desperate Housewives' for a bit of escapism and a bit of fun. But here you have fairly well-off people living in a fairly well-off neighborhood, and this time the financial crisis is hitting everyone.'' 
 So, on Wisteria Lane, Susan Mayer has been forced to take a part-time job to help her ex-husband, a plumber who works 16-hour days, pay for their son's private-school tuition, and the Scavos' pizzeria is threatened because people are dining out less.
 Although police dramas like ''Law & Order'' have long sought to present story lines that are ''ripped from the headlines,'' and medical dramas like ''ER'' have invoked actual cases as the basis for plots, those ''actual'' events -- double murders or rare tropical diseases -- are usually far removed from the daily lives of most viewers.
 Now, however, the real-life financial situations being used for scripts stand out for their directness in addressing the economic plight of average Americans. 
 ''We've never really been an issues-driven show,'' said Mark Ellis, a creator and producer of ''Flashpoint,'' which follows the efforts of an urban police department's elite Strategic Response Unit, a SWAT-like team that also employs the techniques of talk therapy in hostage negotiations. 
 ''But we've all witnessed people close to us who have experienced the loss of their home or job or the depletion of their savings account, and seen how destructive that can be,'' Mr. Ellis said. ''These are tragic times, and we wanted to explore the repercussions of that on a personal basis.''
 In the Feb. 27 episode, titled ''Business as Usual,'' a mortgage company executive who had received a $22 million bonus as his company foreclosed on hundreds of homes was taken hostage by three former customers.
 It never hurts when there is a convenient villain, of course, and television writers have found plenty of them in the current crisis. On ''Flashpoint'' the mortgage company chief is described by one of his foreclosed-upon victims as ''a guy who's got four houses already who booked a five-star Caribbean resort with his buddies to brainstorm how to make the most of these troubled times.'' 
 Two coming episodes of ''Lie to Me,'' the new Fox hit, fit the pattern. One focuses on a Bernard Madoff-like operator of a Ponzi scheme, and another features a contractor who, pinched by the slow economy, cuts corners on a construction project, resulting in a building collapse.
 ''What's happening in the economy is very relevant to the substance of our show,'' said Samuel Baum, the show's creator and executive producer. ''We're looking at what lies people are willing to tell, and at what cost to their co-workers, to maintain their own financial security.''
 Depictions of the financial crisis have seeped into comedy as well as drama. On an episode of ''30 Rock'' last month a fictional group of former Lehman Brothers investment bankers resorted to jobs as interns at NBC. And Sunday night on ''The Simpsons'' Homer Simpson faced foreclosure. 
 Because of the months-long delay between the genesis of a television plotline and its broadcast, fictional series rarely make direct reference to current events, lest they risk seeming stale by the time an episode makes it to air. The episodes being shown now were conceived last summer or fall and filmed early this year, meaning they have benefited from the extended economic downturn. 
 Networks are even considering entire series based on the recession. Fox is developing a comedy titled ''Two-Dollar Beer'' that features a group of friends living in Detroit who are trying to weather that city's worsening financial condition, and ABC Studios is developing ''Canned,'' a situation comedy about a group of friends who all get fired on the same day.
 ''Television serves as a crucible for exploring and tapping into real emotions,'' said Gary Newman, chairman of 20th Century Fox Television, the studio that produces ''Lie to Me'' and ''The Simpsons.'' ''When our characters are dealing with things that are relatable to our own lives, it can become more meaningful.''

HEADLINE: Creeping Onto the Front Covers of Magazines, Paid Ads

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
AS tough times send some publishers running for cover, marketers are running advertisements on the covers of some publications.
 The April issue of Scholastic Parent & Child, scheduled to come out on Monday, will carry an ad on the front cover for the first time in the 16-year history of the magazine. The ad, for a company called Smilebox, will appear in the lower right corner of the cover and carry the label ''advertisement'' in small type.
 The ad, a change in the magazine's policy, came after discussions between the business and editorial sides of the magazine, owned by Scholastic Inc., as well as conversations about the concept with readers. 
 ''There was a lot of thought put into it,'' said Nick Friedman, the editor in chief of Scholastic Parent & Child. ''We knew it was envelope-pushing.'' 
 The results were deemed positive enough to go ahead with the cover ad for April and to sell cover ads for subsequent issues. The next one, planned for May, is being bought by the Juicy Juice line of beverages sold by Nestle, one of the world's largest advertisers.
 ''We'd like to do it as often as advertisers would like to do it,'' said Risa Crandall, vice president for the Scholastic Parents Media unit of Scholastic in New York.
 An advertiser buying a front-cover ad has to buy at least one ad page inside the issue, Ms. Crandall said, for a total cost of $80,000 to $85,000.
 Smilebox, which enables computer users to create greetings, slide shows and scrapbooks, is buying an ad page in the issue along with ad pages in other issues this year, she added, for a total cost of around $154,000. A line of type at the end of the April cover ad will refer readers to the Smilebox ad page inside.
 The ads represent the first time that Smilebox has advertised in Scholastic Parent & Child, said Yannis Dosios, vice president for marketing at Smilebox in Redmond, Wash.
 The appropriateness of a cover ad ''was something that crossed my mind initially,'' he added. ''It has to work within the context of the magazine, otherwise it will be very outlandish.''
 In this instance, the creative teams of the magazine and the company collaborated to produce an ad that will ''meet the sensitivities of what the audience of the magazine is,'' Mr. Dosios said.
 The arrival of paid pitches on magazines' front covers -- until now the province of editorial content -- is emblematic of changing standards for advertising acceptability.
 One reason longtime policies are being rethought is, of course, the steep decline in ad revenue caused by competition from online media, coupled with the slowdown in demand for print ads as a result of the recession.
 So far this week, two magazines are being closed: Travel and Leisure Golf, by American Express Publishing, and Best Life, by Rodale.
 ''As you watch what is going on in the media landscape, it is incumbent on us to provide innovation,'' said Kevin C. O'Malley, vice president and publisher at Esquire in New York, part of the Hearst Magazines division of the Hearst Corporation.
 The February issue of Esquire broke ground with a window, or flap, in the middle of the cover under which were quotations from articles inside the issue and an ad for ''One Way Out,'' a series on the Discovery Channel cable network owned by Discovery Communications. 
 The Esquire cover generated perhaps the most discussion about the blurring line between cover editorial content and advertising since 1990, when two top editors of Omni magazine resigned after complaining about the magazine's publishing an ad on the cover of the November issue. (There was a hole in the Omni cover through which readers could see a hologram, which was part of a Motorola ad on the first inside page of the issue.)
 The American Society of Magazine Editors concluded that Esquire's February cover did not violate the society's guidelines on ad acceptability. But the ad on the cover of Scholastic Parent & Child ''is a violation,'' said Sid Holt, chief executive at the society in New York.
 ''It's unfortunate because it has the potential to tell readers and advertisers that editorial is for sale,'' he added.
 ''Clearly, there are changes in the marketplace,'' Mr. Holt said, ''and editors want to be supportive of their publishing colleagues and maintain the viability of magazines.''
 Although ''we don't want to be in the position of telling people how to run their businesses,'' he added, ''the guidelines are very clear that the cover is editorial space and advertising should not appear.''
 The editor in chief of Esquire, David Granger, is a member of the society. Mr. Friedman of Scholastic Parent & Child, however, is not, so the cover ad's violation of the guidelines has no effect on his magazine.
 ''We respect everything A.S.M.E. represents,'' Mr. Friedman said, ''but we do have taste, and we do have our readers in mind.''
 Another reason for magazine cover ads is that many new media have less stringent policies about where ads may appear.
 The home pages of Web sites, which could be compared to magazine covers, carry ads, from static banners to video clips to elaborate units known as home-page takeovers. The Online Publishers Association introduced on Tuesday several ad formats that are outside the banner box, among them a ''pushdown,'' which opens to display a bigger ad.
 ''As we've started to explore new ad initiatives, especially on the Web, it's made us start to think about different approaches for print,'' Ms. Crandall said.
 ''Readers are steeped in the Web and print and think of them together as one,'' she added, so ads on magazine covers ''are not for them such a grand departure from tradition.''
 Another reason ads are coming to magazine covers is because a print sibling, the newspaper, has reconsidered decades-old rules against display ads on section fronts or even front pages.
 Ms. Crandall said she was looking at cover ads for future issues that would differ from the triangle-shape ads in the right corners for the April and May covers.
 One possibility is ''a bottom strip,'' she said, ''like what The New York Times is doing.''
 Relish, a supplement to Sunday newspapers that is devoted to food, is selling strip ads that fill about two-thirds of the bottom of its front covers. Among the marketers buying such ads from Relish, owned by the Publishing Group of America, is Hormel Foods.

HEADLINE: President Of Poland Is Sanguine On Economy

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY and ALISON SMALE

DATELINE: WARSAW 

 BODY:
Challenging the view that Eastern Europe is heading into a deep recession that is dragging down Western Europe and posing grave risks to the global economy, Poland's president warned against lumping all of the countries in the region ''into one basket.''
 ''We were hit as everyone else by the crisis, although we have not suffered to the degree that some other countries have,'' the president, Lech Kaczynski, said during an hourlong interview on Tuesday. He exuded a quiet confidence about prospects for Poland, which joined NATO 10 years ago this week and the European Union five years later. 
 Mr. Kaczynski seemed at pains to distance himself from the view expressed last week by Hungary's prime minister, who warned of the risk of a new ''Iron Curtain'' descending on a Europe riven by the global economic downturn. 
 So far, Poland has weathered the global financial crisis without the kind of serious damage evident in other countries in the region, Mr. Kaczynski said. His optimism was shared by politicians and analysts in Warsaw, including Poland's finance minister, who predicted that the nation's economy would grow more than 2 percent this year.
 Exports, which have driven growth, particularly since Poland joined the European Union in 2004, are still holding up. Unemployment is rising but is nowhere close to the high-double-digit figures of the 1990s.
 Polish banks, 80 percent of them owned by foreigners, are in good shape, officials here say. The banks did not venture into highly risky investments but instead focused on traditional banking services, coupled with a tight credit policy.
 But that does not mean, Mr. Kaczynski acknowledged, that Poland has escaped the economic crisis unscathed. And the situation could still deteriorate badly, particularly if investors flee the region the way they did in much of Asia after Thailand's currency collapsed in 1997.
 Moreover, Poland's currency, the zloty, has lost over 50 percent of its value in recent months.
 Analysts said Poland's current confidence extended to security issues, reflecting in part the change of administration in Washington, as President Obama reaches out to Russia and discusses the possibility of abandoning a planned missile defense system to be hosted in part by the Czechs and Poles. 
 A bid by Radek Sikorski, Poland's foreign minister, to become NATO secretary general -- for which he would need the support of Germany and other European powers -- may also be influencing that tone.
 Joining NATO appears to have given Poland a level of security long elusive in its history. ''It was obvious to us that this was the only tough security structure there was in the world and that the membership of NATO would only mean benefits for Poland,'' Mr. Kaczynski said.
 Mr. Kaczynski, a conservative, attracted strong criticism inside and outside Poland for strong anti-Russian tones and archnationalist policies when he shared power with his identical twin brother, Jaroslaw, who was prime minister from 2005 to 2007.
 On Tuesday, however, he took care to speak in relatively measured tones about Russia.
 NATO ''could be a safeguard for us from the East,'' he said. ''It would bring us into the family of nations who have world impact, led by the United States.''
 Above all, he said, NATO's 1999 expansion ''stemmed Russian dreams about the return to Central Europe.''
 But that does not mean that Russia has ''abandoned their ideas to regain influence, like using natural resources, natural gas, as a weaponry and trying to influence politicians,'' he said.
 Mr. Kaczynski wants Georgia and Ukraine to join NATO, arguing that that would extend the arc of peace and stability around Russia, where he said developments remained highly unpredictable. He also said he did not want to see NATO become an alliance where the United States led, supporting large countries like Britain, France and Germany, ''and all the rest would be practically disarmed.''

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''Justice Not for Sale'' (editorial, March 3):
 Though the Supreme Court's decision in Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Company may or may not help clarify circumstances under which judges should recuse themselves, your readers must wonder why it took the case of an energy company executive's support of a West Virginia judicial candidate to finally get journalists' attention. 
 After all, personal injury lawyers have been making generous campaign contributions to Mountain State judges for decades while winning unfair anti-business verdicts worth many billions of dollars and selfishly driving jobs to other states. 
 Recently, an energy company that had been denied the right to appeal a multimillion-dollar verdict last year announced that it will now pull 200 remaining jobs out of West Virginia after already canceling plans to build a new headquarters there. 
 This continues a trend wherein from 2001 through 2007 the state's economic growth rate trailed the national average by 53 percent and its job growth lagged 48 percent behind.

HEADLINE: The $300 Makeover*

BYLINE: By JULIE SCELFO

 BODY:
WHEN Benjamen Segal moved into a one-bedroom apartment in a new luxury building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, last year, he was too busy starting a new job to worry about several heaps of belongings dumped in the living room during the move. 
 ''I didn't have time to focus on the niceties of the environment,'' he said. 
 But as the months ticked by, Mr. Segal, who worked from home for a Boston-based company, grew increasingly bothered by the disorder, which seemed to keep growing by the day. Then in January, a few days after he returned from a vacation in Aruba, he became one of the more than 125,000 New York State residents who have lost their jobs in the last six months. ''I was not expecting it,'' he said. ''I was kind of shocked -- you don't really see yourself as one of those statistics.'' 
 Now, on top of the obvious anxieties that accompany unemployment, Mr. Segal found himself dealing with a less-expected one. Having cut back on weekend trips and visits to restaurants, and having decided to start a new company out of his apartment, he was spending even more time there, and the drawbacks of the living room really started to weigh on him.
 ''It was one room with too many purposes: a home office, a dining room, a living room and a rec room all in one,'' Mr. Segal said. ''It looked visually cluttered and it just didn't provide a nice, organized environment to work from. It was claustrophobic and not relaxing.''
 Not surprisingly, he was not about to spend money to redecorate. But living under these circumstances was starting to wear thin.
 Cabin fever may be one of the less severe afflictions of unemployment -- certainly it's one of the least discussed -- but anecdotal evidence suggests it's far from uncommon, particularly now. And since there have always been decorators who insist you can do a lot to improve a space with little or no money, using the furnishings and accessories you have, now seemed a good moment to put their theory to the test. 
 Last month, the Home section approached several New York interior designers (only a few of whom, to be fair, had ever espoused anything like that theory) on behalf of five people in and around the city who had recently lost their jobs and were beginning, by their own accounts, to go stir-crazy at home. 
 The designers were asked to remake a room for one of these prospective clients -- whichever room bothered the client most -- spending no more than $300 (just under the average weekly unemployment benefit in New York State), excluding their own labor. 
 It was a tall order, especially for established decorators accustomed to spending five and sometimes even six figures on a single room. Several pointed out that even if they found an old set of drapes stashed in a closet, or scrounged half a can of paint from a client's neighbor, brackets and hooks and paintbrushes cost money, and small expenses quickly add up. Of the five designers who agreed to participate, most wanted special dispensations, like the right to treat leftover materials lying around their offices as free supplies. They were told they could, but were asked to do it sparingly, and to hew as closely as possible to the spirit of the test.
 Even then, only one managed to come in below the $300 mark. But all stayed under $500, even if they wanted to spend more.

HEADLINE: Now, Just Trash

BYLINE: By DAN LEVIN; Zhan Yingying and Tang Xuemei contributed research.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Each morning Tian Wengui emerges from the home he makes under a bridge here, two large sacks slung over his shoulder. Through the day, and well into the night, he scours garbage cans for soda bottles, soy sauce containers and cooking oil jugs. Selling the refuse to one of Beijing's ubiquitous recycling depots, Mr. Tian can earn $3 on a good day. 
 But good days are getting harder to come by. 
 Since Mr. Tian migrated from Sichuan province, the multibillion-dollar recycling industry has gone into a nosedive because of the global economic crisis and a concomitant fall in commodity prices. Bottles now sell for half of what they did in the summer. 
 ''Even trash has become worthless,'' Mr. Tian said recently as he made his way to a collection center, his sacks nearly bursting. 
 The collapse of the recycling business has affected people like Mr. Tian, the middlemen who buy the waste products and the factories that refashion the recyclable waste into products bound for stores and construction sites around the world. American and European waste dealers who sell to China are finding that their shipments are being refused by clients when they arrive in Asia. 
 The ultimate victim may be the environment, already overrun with enough trash in places to threaten people's health, now further burdened with refuse that until recently would have been recycled.
 The effect is being felt acutely in China, the world's largest garbage importer. The United States, for example, exported 11.6 million tons of recovered paper and cardboard last year to China, up from 2.1 million tons in 2000, according to the American Forest and Paper Association. 
 Because Chinese consumption is far less developed than the West's, more than 70 percent of the materials that feed the country's recycling industry must come from abroad, said Wang Yonggang, a spokesman for the China National Resources Recycling Association.
 ''Chinese tradition is all about saving and being thrifty,'' he said. ''People here would rather have things repaired several times before abandoning them.'' 
 The drop in commodity prices was so rapid that in a matter of weeks last fall container ships carrying used railroad wheels and empty dog food cans arrived in Chinese ports worth far less than they had been when they departed Newark, Rotterdam or Los Angeles.
 ''Everything was moving along just fine until October and then we fell off a cliff,'' said Bruce Savage, a spokesman for the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, a trade organization that mostly represents American waste processing companies. 
 The United States exported $22 billion worth of recycled materials to 152 countries in 2007. Now the organization estimates the value of American recyclables has decreased by 50 to 70 percent. Western dealers say they are grappling with mounting stockpiles whose value in many cases continues to sink. To make matters worse, Chinese importers have been demanding to renegotiate contracts drastically downward. In some cases, they are refusing to accept shipments they already have a contractual obligation to take.
 ''There are still many containers full of waste sitting at the port in Hong Kong,'' Mr. Wang, of China National Resources Recycling Association, said. ''It's hard to say when they'll be picked up.'' 
 According to the association, a ton of copper scrap now sells for $3,000, down from more than $8,000 in 2007. 
 Tin is now selling for $5 a pound, down from $300. Paper has sagged by as much as 80 percent. 
 ''People in this industry were once making a killing taking waste from overseas, but the era of huge profits is now over,'' Mr. Wang said.
 The tough times are hitting Chinese recyclers at every level. Gao Zuxue's family runs a small collection depot in central Beijing.
 Standing in a dimly lighted, half-empty room that is usually packed with broken radiators, soda bottles and newspapers, Mr. Gao said he earned nearly $450 a month in the boom days of 2007. Now he is lucky to make $80.
 ''People aren't selling their junk to us because they think the price is ridiculous,'' he said.
 Many manufacturers that process imported recyclables are finding it difficult to stay in business.
 ''My goal is just to survive,'' said Luo Guoliang, an executive at the Yang Xin Long Fu Company in Shandong province, which makes polyester and polypropylene filaments for fabric and rugs, all of it recycled material.
 Mr. Luo said his company imported a third of its plastic from abroad last year, paying $1,200 for a ton of shredded plastic bottle flakes. While the company now pays half that amount, he said many of his domestic suppliers had closed, making it difficult to find the raw material for production. 
 Yet, in China's current malaise, the company has bigger concerns. Fearing instability, the local government has forbidden factories from laying off workers, even as sales evaporate.
 ''The damage from the economic crisis is unbearable.'' Mr. Luo said.
 Across the Pacific, waste traders in the United States are shutting mills, cutting production and selling their stock at fire-sale prices. George Adams, president of SA Recycling, which processes metal at 40 recycling plants in the western United States, said he wrote down $10 million in losses in October.
 ''That inventory is gone now, but the pain I won't soon forget,'' said Mr. Adams, who ships much of his product to China. 
 Environmentalists and recycling experts worry about the impact of the recycling slump. With Western curbside recycling programs becoming less profitable, local governments are being forced to re-examine their programs as they struggle to balance budgets. In some cases, that means that office printouts and soda cans, once exported, went to landfills. 
 ''It used to be that recyclers would pay governments for these goods,'' said Mr. Savage of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries. ''But now governments have to pay recyclers. What was once a revenue stream is now a cost to cities.''
 While recycling executives say prices have bottomed out and in some cases have improved slightly -- for copper and plastics, for example -- they are bracing for tough times ahead as the global economic crisis wears on.
 So, too, are the residents of Bajiacun, a village built on trash on the outskirts of Beijing, where hundreds of people earn a living from -- and live among -- other people's castoffs. 
 On a recent day, Chen Xiaorong, 36, squatted on a vast island of stockpiled notepads, magazines and schoolbooks near her tiny red-brick shack, a tower of newspapers looming above her.
 ''I know people who lost everything betting on recycling,'' she said. Many of her neighbors have returned to the countryside, while the $735 her extended family would earn a month has shrunk to $360.
 Sorting through discarded calligraphed sheets of Chairman Mao's poems, she added, ''China now has more garbage than it can digest. Do we really need America's junk, too?''

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks New Afghan Supply Routes, Even in Iran

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The United States is seeking new supply routes for the war in Afghanistan that would bypass Russia, and has even had logistics experts review overland roads through Iran that might be used by NATO allies, according to military planners and Pentagon officials.
 The effort is aimed at developing reliable alternatives to routes through the Khyber Pass in Pakistan, where convoys have come under increasing attack by the Taliban, and to prepare for the possible loss of an important air base in Kyrgyzstan. The planning also reflects growing concern that Russia could use its clout to restrict American and allied shipments that would be passing in greater amounts through its territory on the way to staging areas in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan en route to Afghanistan. 
 Pentagon and military officials cautioned that the United States was not in any way considering the use of overland routes through Iran for American supplies, a politically implausible proposition given the near frozen state of relations between the United States and Iran. American officials say that recent overtures from the Obama administration toward Iran -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton last week proposed a conference on Afghanistan that would include Iran -- did not encompass any use of Iranian roads.
 But Pentagon and NATO planners, as part of an effort to consider every contingency, have studied Iranian routes from the port of Chabahar, on the Arabian Sea, that link with a new road recently completed by India in western Afghanistan. The route is considered shorter and safer than going through Pakistan.
 ''In the course of prudent planning, our military planners have looked at virtually every conceivable avenue of supplying our forces in Afghanistan,'' said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary. ''However, as you would expect, they have done so with an eye on logistical feasibility rather than political reality.''
 The route through Iran nonetheless might be the focus of bilateral supply talks conducted by individual NATO allies that have relations with Iran, as NATO's supreme allied commander, Gen. John Craddock, an American, suggested last month. Moreover, the Shiite government in Iran has long had testy relations with the Sunni Taliban, improving the odds that it could offer transit of supplies to NATO nations.
 In an interview in February with The Associated Press, General Craddock said NATO would not oppose individual member nations' making deals with Iran to supply their forces in Afghanistan. ''Those would be national decisions,'' he said. ''NATO should act in a manner that is consistent with their national interest and with their ability to resupply their forces. I think it is purely up to them.''
 Outlines of potential alternatives to routes through Russia emerged in greater detail this week, as the American military hosted a conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, for transportation officials and private contractors from two former Soviet republics -- Azerbaijan and Georgia -- and from Turkey to examine new supply routes into Afghanistan.
 The route would be a west-to-east swing across the Caucasus region and into Central Asian states to the north of Afghanistan.
 Officially, the United States and NATO would be expected to explain that this new route would be a supplement to other transit lines, and not intended as an antidote to potential Russian coercion as Russia takes on a greater share of supplying the Afghan mission.
 ''We want to avoid any danger of single-point failure, whether it's Pakistan or Russia,'' said one American military officer. ''It's simply prudent planning to have alternative lines of communication.''
 Even so, any new deals for routes through former Soviet republics would diminish the Kremlin's growing role in supplying the alliance in Afghanistan, and would be expected to frustrate the leadership in Moscow. In particular, including Georgia as part of a new route would irritate Russia. 
 Georgia, which fought a war last summer with Russia, is said by American officials to be eagerly seeking a role in supplying NATO troops in Afghanistan -- as it desires alliance membership, and protection, and wants to do all it can to bind itself to the Atlantic alliance.
 Although Russia expresses a desire to support the American and NATO mission in Afghanistan, Kremlin leaders offered large economic incentives to Kyrgyzstan to kick out the Americans from a base in Manas, just outside the Kyrgyz capital, that has been an important hub for moving troops into Afghanistan as well as a base for tanker planes.
 Mr. Morrell, the Pentagon spokesman, said late Wednesday that the Kyrgyz government had agreed that American negotiators would travel there in coming days and engage in talks on extending access rights to the Manas base. The question of additional payments is expected to be central to the discussion. Even so, the Air Force is working on contingency plans to move the tanker fleet to bases in the Persian Gulf if it loses basing rights to Manas.
 The Azeri capital, Baku, is emerging as a leading candidate to substitute for Manas, should the Kyrgyz government refuse to reconsider its withdrawal of the basing rights. 
 American and Azeri officials said that the focus of the discussions on Monday and Tuesday was a surface route that would move supplies from the Georgian port of Poti on the Black Sea and overland to Baku, where they would cross the Caspian Sea to Aktau, Kazakhstan, and then overland across Uzbekistan into Afghanistan.
 A second potential route would land cargo at the Caspian seaport of Turkmenbashi, in Turkmenistan, for transit into Afghanistan. Talks on supply routes have also been held with officials in Tajikistan, another neighbor to the north of Afghanistan.
 One American official said the first ''trial run'' of cargo containers on the new route was conducted within the last two weeks, with shipments of lumber sent from Turkey to Georgia to Azerbaijan, and then onward toward Afghanistan.
 At the conference, the American military was represented by officials from the European Command, Transportation Command and Defense Logistics Agency, and officials said the talks focused only on movement of nonlethal supplies.

HEADLINE: Notes of Distress and Discord From the Esteemed Philadelphia Orchestra

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
The Philadelphia Orchestra, a storied American institution that lifted classical music to new heights of public awareness when Leopold Stokowski conducted it for the 1940 Disney film ''Fantasia'' and that has remained one of the world's finest musical ensembles, is in trouble. The Fabulous Philadelphians, as the musicians have long been known, are being hit by leadership turmoil even as they suffer from the financial distress that has struck most orchestras during the recession.
 The Philadelphia Orchestra, which appears at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday evening, is functioning without a permanent board chairman, chief executive or music director. It has canceled a prestigious European tour scheduled for this summer, delayed a project to stream concerts on the Internet, and will see its recording deal end with no clear extension or replacement certain. And its new home, Verizon Hall in the Kimmel Center, which opened with much fanfare in 2001 and has been dogged by criticism of its acoustics, faces yet another acoustical evaluation.
 On Wednesday the orchestra announced salary reductions and deep cuts in the administrative staff. Those measures are the sharpest shrinkage recently among the traditional Big Five orchestras, which also include those of Boston, New York, Chicago and Cleveland. The Pittsburgh Symphony said on Monday that it would lay off nine employees and cut two unfilled jobs. 
 Few would argue that the Philadelphia Orchestra has lost even a stride in musicianship. It maintains the golden glow of its famous string sound and its tradition of impeccable woodwind playing. But experts in the industry fear that if the distress continues, its status among the anointed may be threatened.
 ''There's a huge vacuum right now,'' said David Nicastro, a violist with 14 years in the orchestra. ''We're hungering for a leader, someone we can trust musically and artistically to lift us up and realize all the potential that's there.'' 
 The vacuum, he said, has hurt morale among the musicians. ''It's actually amazing to me that the orchestra is still performing'' at such a high level, he said, ''considering the missteps and lost opportunities.''
 Of deeper concern is worry that financial downsizing or dysfunction will dampen its reputation for orchestral primacy, which helps attract top soloists, guest conductors and tour invitations. ''I'm constantly aware of how fragile it is,'' Mr. Nicastro said. 
 Might the orchestra fall from its pedestal? ''That's something that we're not going to allow to happen,'' said Frank Slattery Jr., a Philadelphia businessman and orchestra patron who volunteered to serve as temporary executive director. 
 And other orchestra players were less pessimistic. Gloria de Pasquale, a cellist who is married to one of four de Pasquale brothers who have all played in the orchestra, said that the board -- of which she is a member, elected by the orchestra -- had stepped up with money and ideas to meet the challenges. ''You find the strength of a board in times like this,'' she said at the intermission here last Tuesday night, when the orchestra was performing Berg and Mahler with the guest conductor Vladimir Jurowski.
 On Tuesday there were signs that the orchestra might be starting to turn the corner. The board hired a task force of five industry experts, led by the orchestra consultant Thomas W. Morris, a respected former executive director of the Cleveland Orchestra, to diagnose its ailments and suggest solutions. In addition, a new chairman has been selected, with an announcement expected next week, Ms. de Pasquale said. That in turn will open the door for a chief executive to be hired. Then a music-director search can proceed in earnest.
 ''It's going to turn to be a great institution again,'' said Charles Dutoit, who is serving a caretaker role as chief conductor and artistic adviser. ''It's never been anything else.''
 Mr. Dutoit, who has a long and close association with the orchestra, provides continuity and gives the players a sense of security. Several musicians said he had the confidence and familiarity with the orchestra to maintain its sound yet still strive to improve it. But his tenure (four seasons) and powers are limited. 
 At a rehearsal of Dvorak's ''New World'' Symphony on Tuesday, he made his intentions clear. ''I need a richer sound,'' he told the first violins at one point. ''The balance is disturbed because the sound is tense. Rich!''
 The Philadelphia Orchestra has been around for 109 seasons. Stokowski, who created its trademark lush string sound, was followed by Eugene Ormandy, a prodigious recorder of the standard repertory on LPs. Together their tenures lasted 68 years. Riccardo Muti, Wolfgang Sawallisch and Christoph Eschenbach followed as music directors for terms of diminishing length. Philadelphia was the first American orchestra to visit China, in 1973. 
 After a two-month strike in 1996, the orchestra has been weakened by occasional factionalism on the board, high staff turnover and another bitter labor dispute in 2004. Music professionals also sense a current of insularity and privilege among the players. One reason may be that many members come from the Curtis Institute of Music, an elite conservatory down the street. And for years individual players were accustomed to having royalties pour in from the recordings that poured out before the classical record industry collapsed. 
 Meanwhile, other orchestras have moved forward. The Cleveland Orchestra is establishing residencies in Florida and elsewhere to increase its donor base. The Los Angeles Philharmonic hired Gustavo Dudamel, a hot young conducting talent, as its music director. The New York Philharmonic became the orchestra that went to North Korea and plans to go to Vietnam.
 When asked what set the Philadelphia Orchestra apart these days, Mr. Slattery cited its high profile, its home in the birthplace of the United States and its ''distinctive sound.''
 Like orchestras across the country, Philadelphia has been hit hard by the recession. As of Jan. 31, the endowment was down 30 percent, compared with a year before that, Mr. Slattery said, noting that the market has declined even more in the last six weeks. About $3 million in state and city funds is gone, although Mr. Slattery said he was holding out hope that much of it would be restored. The average donation is down 10 percent, and ticket revenues are off by 14 percent. 
 Without cost reductions and additional donations, Mr. Slattery said, the orchestra faces a potential $2.2 million deficit on a budget of $46.6 million this year. He refused to predict what the financial picture might be next year or to disclose even provisional budget figures.
 ''I have no clear idea as to what's going to happen,'' he said. ''If the markets don't turn, I can see catastrophe for American orchestras.'' 
 Mr. Slattery said that of 92 employees, 12 would be laid off, and six unfilled positions would be eliminated. He declined to specify the positions. Those who earn more than $50,000 would take a 10 percent pay cut on salary exceeding that amount, and the orchestra's six vice presidents would take a bigger hit, according to a complicated formula. The cuts are expected to save $900,000 a year, Mr. Slattery said.
 The staff salary cuts set the stage for efforts to roll back a generous contract granted the musicians during flusher times, in 2004. ''Everything is on the table,'' Mr. Slattery said, but declined to say whether he would ask the musicians for givebacks. Their current base salary is $124,800, although most earn more.
 Programming already has been affected. Mr. Dutoit said that the orchestra had replaced an expensive concert performance of Strauss's opera ''Elektra'' with orchestral music.
 The orchestra's latest round of woes dates to the tenure of Mr. Eschenbach, who left as music director at the end of last season after five years, the shortest term in nearly a century. The orchestra was divided over his effectiveness. The most common complaint was lack of chemistry. Last July the president and chief executive, James Undercofler, announced that he was canceling a tour to prominent European festivals, citing financial pressures. 
 The next blow came in January, when Mr. Undercofler resigned nearly seven months before his contract was to end to pursue other ''career interests,'' the orchestra said. Mr. Undercofler did not immediately respond to a message left with the orchestra. Orchestra members and officials knowledgeable about the management said that he failed to keep board members informed of significant decisions and mishandled Mr. Eschenbach's departure and the tour cancellation.
 Mr. Undercofler, a former conservatory dean, had little experience running orchestras. Ms. de Pasquale, who was on the search committee, said he was a risky choice. ''It turned out that we probably shouldn't have taken the risk,'' she said.
 Later that month the board chairman, Harold A. Sorgenti, stepped aside earlier than expected, for what the orchestra said were business reasons. A temporary substitute was named.
 ''We get bad press probably because of some of the things we've done,'' Mr. Slattery said. ''It's my job to fix that.''

HEADLINE: Tax Havens Likely to Be Target of G-20 Nations

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Nations like Switzerland and Luxembourg, long considered tax havens, are coming under increasing pressure by European officials to divulge more information on potential tax evaders.
 The issue could be a major topic at a meeting in April of the Group of 20 leading developed and emerging economies. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has added Switzerland, Luxembourg, Austria, Singapore and Hong Kong to a list of uncooperative tax havens, which already includes such well-established havens as Andorra, Liechtenstein and Monaco.
 Nicholas Bray, a spokesman for the OECD in Paris, confirmed that the organization had been preparing information on tax havens for the G-20 meeting in London on April 2 at the request of the French and German governments. The news was first reported by the French newspaper La Tribune on Wednesday.
 Bank secrecy laws in Luxembourg, which is in the European Union, have come under intense scrutiny after some of the investment funds based in Luxembourg were engulfed in the fraud at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, exposing holes in the country's regulatory system.
 ''This is not an OECD blacklist,'' Mr. Bray said. ''It's up to the G-20 to decide what to with it.''
 The 30-member OECD sets standards for offshore centers, but has no policing powers.
 A French official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the list, drawn up by the OECD, named ''over 30 countries'' that are uncooperative with the international tax authorities. 
 An international financial diplomat, who has been involved in formulating tax policy but is not authorized to speak publicly, said that the true targets of European interest were Switzerland and Luxembourg. ''The pressure is really building to an almost irresistible level'' on the two countries, the diplomat said. ''They realize they won't be able to carry on as they have been.''
 Banking secrecy was enshrined in law in Switzerland in the 1930s. The government might have thought that it had put the issue to bed when it agreed several years ago to exchange banking information with the European Union in suspected cases of fraud. But those accords did not cover tax evasion, and the issue has re-emerged.
 Last month, UBS of Switzerland, the largest manager of funds for the world's wealthy, agreed to pay a fine of $780 million and disclose the identity of some clients after the authorities in the United States authorities accused it of helping wealthy Americans dodge taxes. 
 But not all the G-20 members are as focused on the issue as France, Germany and, recently, the United States. 
 Canada, and to an extent Britain, would prefer to use the G-20 meetings to improve financial architecture and to agree on steps to lift growth, according to officials from some other countries. Austria's finance ministry said Wednesday that the G-20 was not the appropriate forum in which to deal with these issues.
 For now, the Swiss government is holding the line on bank secrecy, but the question is for how much longer.
 A survey released Wednesday by the Swiss Bankers Association showed that banking secrecy is supported by almost four-fifths of the Swiss population, which wants to preserve client confidentiality.

HEADLINE: For Spring Clothes, A Lost Season?

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
ON a recent afternoon, Bergdorf Goodman was library-silent. At Saks Fifth Avenue, mannequins stood in for shoppers. In Henri Bendel, sales staff pounced on anyone who came through the doors. All along Fifth Avenue, the designer spring collections -- an annual shopping ritual for the well-heeled and winter-weary -- have largely arrived in stores. 
 No matter. 
 Bangles and handbags on slabs of marble and glass are going largely untouched, like artifacts in museums. 
 ''Last year you'd run in here and say, 'I need these shoes, they're going to sell out,' '' said Stacey Widlitz, a retailing analyst, as she turned over a strappy Fendi sandal in the Saks shoe department on Tuesday. ''You felt an urgency. Now you come in and the store looks more like a museum than a department store and you think to yourself, I can wait.'' 
 And why not? The spring collections are being sold at full price: $800 jeans, $1,500 blazers, $10,000 necklaces. If consumers learned anything during the Christmas shopping season, it was that if they sit on their wallets long enough, they could eventually snap up elite brands for fire-sale prices. 
 The mistletoe and tinsel are long gone, but consumers have yet to break the habit. And in the retailing game of chicken, the odds are in their favor. 
 February retail sales at Neiman Marcus, Saks and Nordstrom were some of the worst in the industry. Barneys New York, which does not publicly report monthly sales, is seriously ailing. Moreover, high-end stores order their spring merchandise months before the season arrives. So while they were able to cancel or return some orders as the economy plunged into recession last year, their inventory is not yet in line with weakened shopper demand. 
 ''What's flowing into stores this spring and summer reflects expectations from nine months ago, which were not low enough,'' said Ms. Widlitz, who works for Pali Research in New York. 
 That means more discounts are on the way, though they will not be as stunning as those at Christmastime. 
 ''That's not going to happen again in our lifetime,'' said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for NPD Group, a retailing consultancy. 
 That is partly because luxury chains have managed to trim at least some of their inventory. It's also because fashion companies were incensed during the holidays when their prestige labels were being sold at bargain-basement prices that competed with their own stores. Some designers said they are still smarting and deciding whether they will continue supplying certain chains. 
 Responding to the call for lower prices, designers are working with stores like Neiman Marcus to roll out items with mid-tier prices. 
 That couldn't come a moment too soon for Neiman's, which said Wednesday that it suffered a $509.2 million loss for the three months ending Jan. 31, compared with a profit of $44.3 million a year earlier, and that it plans to drive sales with additional promotions and other events. 
 While the spring discounts may not be as deep as last fall, analysts say they will come early. In high-end stores, merchandise usually stays on shelves at full price for 8 to 10 weeks before it is marked down. This season, however, analysts predict it will remain at full price for half that time. 
 Retailers, of course, loathe price cuts because they erode profits. But selling designer collections at full price in this economy requires more than a pretty face. It necessitates a battle plan. 
 At Saks, the plan is multipronged, beginning with the company's spring advertisements. Historically they have included minimal text because the photographs of clothes, bags and shoes are meant to do the talking. This season, however, Saks is beefing up its copy to highlight the reasons why a product is special, or -- to put it another way -- why consumers might want to plunk down precious dollars during a recession. 
 For years, decadent consumer spending and free-flowing credit meant no luxury chain had to justify why a sweater cost more than a flight to Rome. 
 ''We've definitely seen -- I think everyone has seen -- a drop-off in this idea of shopping for entertainment,'' said Kimberly Grabel, Saks's senior vice president for marketing. ''People are shopping in a very focused way: What is it that they need?''
 Saks's other tactics include collaborating with its suppliers to introduce some lower-priced accessories and other items. It is also focusing on what is known as ''clienteling,'' or calling and sending e-mail messages to its best customers with ideas on how to spruce up their existing wardrobes rather than replacing them entirely. And a new women's fashion area in the store called WEAR offers name-brand clothes at more affordable prices. A manifesto on the inside of the catalogue reads: ''At a time when many of us are re-examining the more frivolous things in our lives, Saks has sought out items of authentic value.'' 
 Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist in San Francisco, said affluent consumers are returning to an older way of shopping: buying one or maybe two exceptional pieces rather than a designer's entire line. ''That used to be the way people bought luxury items,'' she said. ''They didn't buy the T-shirt from Armani. They bought the jacket.''
 Retailing professionals are not in agreement about whether this economy has irrevocably changed consumer spending habits. 
 Burton M. Tansky, president and chief executive of Neiman Marcus, has said in telephone conferences with investors that it is too early to make such pronouncements. Some industry professionals disagree, though, saying consumers are clearly gravitating toward a simpler way of living that is in sync with the nation's growing environmental sustainability movement. 
 ''I feel really strongly that this is a permanent shift,'' Ms. Yarrow said. ''There really hasn't been a time when we've been quite that frivolous in spending money. It's a correction.'' 
 Indeed, after years in negative territory, the national savings rate jumped to more than 3 percent during the holidays. 
 ''Luxury is going to have to learn it's for a very unique class of shopper,'' said Mr. Cohen, of NPD Group. 
 He calls it the Rolls-Royce theory of retailing. ''Pure luxury is not about price,'' he said. ''Does a person who's buying a Rolls-Royce or a five-carat diamond ring start negotiating for price? The cachet, the image, the quality, the service -- price is not the determining factor. It's at the bottom of the list, if on it at all. Luxury is going to have to exist in a smaller space.''
 After all, the ''aspirational'' shopper -- the customer who could not afford designer brands without skipping meals and running up debt -- has disappeared. For more than a decade, global brands like Louis Vuitton and Gucci rode to glory by selling this customer a taste of prestige -- a $600 handbag instead of a $3,000 dress. Now that strategy is being severely tested. 
 ''It's not to say luxury is dead forever,'' said Robert S. Drbul, a managing director at Barclays Capital Equity Research. ''It will come back. But it may take a few quarters. It may take a year.'' 
 He paused before continuing. 
 ''It may take something longer than that.''

HEADLINE: 4 States With Unemployment Above 10%

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Four states -- California, South Carolina, Michigan and Rhode Island -- registered unemployment rates above 10 percent in January, and the national rate is expected to hit double digits by year-end. 
 The Labor Department's report on state unemployment, released Wednesday, showed the increasing damage inflicted on workers and companies from a recession, now in its second year. Some economists now predict the unemployment rate will hit 10 percent by year-end, and peak at 11 percent or higher by the middle of 2010.
 In December, only Michigan had a double-digit jobless rate. One month later, four states did and that did not count Puerto Rico, where the unemployment rate actually dipped to 13 percent in January, from 13.5 percent in December.
 California's unemployment rate jumped to 10.1 percent in January, from 8.7 percent in December, as jobs have disappeared in the construction, finance and retail industries.
 Michigan's jobless rate jumped to 11.6 percent in January, the highest in the country. The second-highest jobless rate was South Carolina at 10.4 percent. Rhode Island was next at 10.3 percent, which was a record high for the state in federal records dating to 1976. California rounded out the top four.
 Forty-nine states and the District of Columbia registered unemployment rate increases. Louisiana was the only state to record a monthly drop. Its unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent in January, from 5.5 percent in December.
 The unemployment rate, released last week, rose to 8.1 percent in February, the highest in more than 25 years.
 Employers are laying off workers, holding hours down and freezing or cutting pay as the recession eats into sales and profits.
 And more layoffs are on the way. The National Semiconductor Corporation said Wednesday that it would lay off 1,725 employees, more than a quarter of its work force, after third-quarter profits fell 71 percent.
 The industrial conglomerate United Technologies, which makes Otis elevators and Sikorsky helicopters, said on Tuesday that it would lay off 11,600 workers, or 5 percent of its work force. Dow Chemical said on Monday that it would cut 3,500 jobs at the chemical company, Rohm & Haas, as part of its $15 billion buyout of the company.
 Nationwide, the recession has claimed a net total of 4.4 million jobs since December 2007, and has left 12.5 million people searching for work -- more than the population of Pennsylvania.
 The state unemployment report also showed that North Carolina and Oregon -- along with South Carolina -- notched the biggest monthly gains of 1.6 percentage points each.
 North Carolina's rate soared to 9.7 percent in January, from 8.1 percent in December, while Oregon jumped to 9.9 percent, from 8.3 percent.
 Meanwhile, Georgia's jobless rate climbed to 8.6 percent in January, a record high on federal records.
 Wyoming continued to register the lowest unemployment rate -- 3.7 percent.

HEADLINE: Player Representatives Face Big Decision

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Thirty-two player representatives and their alternates will begin arriving in Hawaii on Thursday to vote for the next executive director of the National Football League Players Association. This marks the first time in the players union's history that it will have a contested election for executive director.
 The finalists are two former players, Trace Armstrong and Troy Vincent, and two lawyers, David Cornwell and DeMaurice Smith. 
 The player reps face a number of fundamental questions: Should the new executive director be a former player or a lawyer? An N.F.L.P.A. insider or an outsider? The favorite son of a particular group (Armstrong or Vincent) or a compromise choice (as Smith is said to be)?
 This much is certain: Whoever is elected had better be a convincing general because he will most certainly have to lead players into a battle against N.F.L. owners who are intent on significantly increasing their share of the league's revenue.
 ''Not only is 30 years of progress in collective bargaining at stake, but the N.F.L.P.A. also has an opportunity to grow as a labor organization and as a business,'' Cornwell said.
 Armstrong, 43, was a 15-year N.F.L. veteran who served as president of the players union for eight years. He was close with the late Gene Upshaw, the longtime executive director who died in August of pancreatic cancer. He and Upshaw shared the same agent, Tom Condon, and Armstrong and Condon work together at CAA Sports. Armstrong is considered the status-quo candidate.
 Vincent, 38, was also an N.F.L. player for 15 years. He was a union president for four years and is popular with players.
 Smith, 45, is a former assistant United States attorney who is a partner at the law firm Patton Boggs in Washington. He has no sports industry experience.
 Cornwell, 48, a former legal counsel for the N.F.L., is an Atlanta-based lawyer who represents players in matters ranging from drug suspensions to agent disputes. Cornwell was eliminated as a finalist by the union's search committee in January, but in accordance with the union's bylaws, he became a finalist again when three players nominated him.
 Two months ago, I suggested that the highly respected Vincent was the best candidate to lead the union through difficult times. With labor tensions on the horizon -- the collective bargaining agreement will expire after next season -- players will need to be informed, unified and inspired.
 Vincent is young enough to connect with active players, and he has four years' experience as the union president, two as vice president and five as a player representative. He has participated in labor negotiations. Like many players, Vincent made his way to the N.F.L. from humble beginnings, raised in Trenton by his mother in economically challenging circumstances, educated in a public school system that too often told black and brown students ''You can't.''
 Vincent did. He served as a captain on three teams and received the Walter Payton Man of the Year award and the N.F.L. Athletes in Action Bart Starr Award. Upshaw was so impressed with Vincent that in February 2007 he wrote an e-mail message endorsing him as his successor. 
 As Vincent began to look at the N.F.L.P.A. more critically, especially its relationship with retired players and its overall efficiency, his relationship with Upshaw and much of the union hierarchy soured. Vincent said he felt that the ferocious opposition to his candidacy sprang from that internal disenchantment. Although the other candidates have escaped the scrutiny of the news media, Vincent has not.
 One report questioned his outside business interests. Another suggested that he breached security when he forwarded an e-mail message to his business partners that contained confidential information about players' agents. Another report questioned his link to a Congressional inquiry into the N.F.L.P.A. selection process. Last week, Upshaw's widow, Terri, questioned whether Vincent was the right candidate.
 In each instance, the N.F.L.P.A. executive committee probed and felt comfortable enough with Vincent's explanation or its own investigation to allow him to advance through the process. 
 The players are apparently wise enough to realize that the union faces a crisis of leadership. Indeed, fissures had developed even before Upshaw's death. He had became involved in an ugly, two-year dispute with retired players while a number of active players had begun to complain of a disconnect with the union.
 The younger retired players are less concerned with how much the new executive director is paid than with how he keeps them connected to the game.
 ''There is a new breed of retired player as well,'' said Roman Oben, a longtime union rep who retired after the 2007 season.
 ''The retired player now isn't the retired player of the '60s and '70s,'' Oben said. ''People got three, four million in the bank. Nobody cared about Gene's salary or how much he makes. People just want to see this thing done right. This is still an organization that services players.''
 The most important question facing the players is whether they are ready to take back their organization after 25 years of Upshaw's iron-fisted rule.
 A vote for Armstrong is generally seen as a vote to maintain the status quo. A vote for Smith and, to a lesser degree, Cornwell, is a seen as a compromise. A vote for Vincent, given his contentious relationship with the union hierarchy, is seen as a clear vote for a new direction.
 On Saturday, four candidates will finally have the opportunity to present their case, then the 32 player reps will decide on Sunday. This is the election of their football lives.

HEADLINE: Paying Entrepreneurs To Find the Right Business

BYLINE: By BRENT BOWERS

 BODY:
JIM ELLIS and Kevin Taweel used a search fund to acquire a $6 million roadside assistance company with 45 employees that they built into the nation's largest provider of insurance products to cellphone companies.
 Jim Southern, a Boston investor, said his search funds had generated 14 times the capital he placed in 20 companies over an average holding period of eight years, while Dave Carver, the co-founder of Search Fund Partners in Menlo Park, Calif., said his company was also achieving strong results with the same investment model.
 While most people have never heard of them, search funds are attracting increasing attention as a way for small businesses to beat the usual odds of success, even in the midst of a deepening recession.
 This is the way a search fund typically works: One or two ambitious graduates of a top-tier business school, who want to run their own business but recognize they lack practical experience, offer themselves as fledgling entrepreneurs who can make some tough-minded investors a lot of money. 
 These investors put up about half a million dollars for the pair to spend up to two years scouring the marketplace for a promising business with $10 million to $30 million in revenue. If satisfied with the choice, the investors help finance the acquisition of the business, join its board and give their young partners a crash course in hands-on management. If all works out, the venture grows and makes everybody richer.
 H. Irving Grousbeck, co-founder of Continental Cablevision (later Media One) and now a consulting professor of business at Stanford University, helped originate the business model a quarter of a century ago and has been studying it ever since.
 Mr. Grousbeck says studies by the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at Stanford, which he co-directs, show average annual returns by search funds to their original investors of well over 30 percent. 
 The results are skewed by the big winners, which constitute about a fourth of the total. Another fourth fold without making a purchase, a fourth lose money for their investors and a fourth provide a middling return, according to Mr. Southern, the Boston investor. Still, taken as a whole, search funds can be a winning proposition.
 The funds do have drawbacks, of course. The same recession that has attracted search fund buyers has scared off sellers, for example, Mr. Grousbeck said.
 Moreover, major successes are rare. 
 One was Road Rescue Inc., a Houston venture that Mr. Ellis and Mr. Taweel acquired in 1995 for $8 million and built into the insurance giant Asurion Inc. In that case, the original investors in Road Rescue received more than a 100-fold return on their stakes.
 Asurion provides a case study of the power of the search fund model in the right circumstances. The founders, who had studied under Mr. Grousbeck at Stanford, said they liked Roadside Rescue because it was not a towing company. Instead, it sold roadside assistance insurance through local wireless carriers to their users. The venture grew by 50 to 100 percent a year in its first four years.
 Then the two men had an epiphany: they were not in the roadside-assistance business; they were in the cellphone services business. In 1999 they expanded into insurance for loss or damage to cellphones. After making three major acquisitions in recent years, Asurion, based in San Mateo, Calif., has grown into a $2.5 billion company with 10,000 employees, more than 70 million wireless customers and a growing presence in Asia.
 Mr. Ellis, who stepped away from an active role in the company several years ago (though he still sits on its board as a nonvoting director), now divides his time between lecturing at Stanford and investing in small and medium-size businesses. 
 He acknowledged that he and Mr. Taweel had the good fortune of choosing an industry on the cusp of an explosion in consumer demand. ''If we had grown more slowly than we did, we would have been losing ground,'' he said. Still, he said, the leap to $2.5 billion in revenue, from $6 million, in 13 years ''is the biggest multiple any search fund company has had.''
 Mr. Southern, the Boston investor, made a small fortune in a niche printing business that he acquired in 1984. Through dividends and the sale of the company 10 years later, his investment returned 35 times the original capital, for an average annual yield of 60 percent.
 ''For years, I was the most successful search fund entrepreneur,'' he said. ''But Asurion knocked the cover off the ball.'' He has put money behind more than 40 search funds, with results that he said have been ''better than those in the Stanford study.''
 ''The reaction I get when I tell a business owner or an investor about search funds is, 'I wish I had thought of that,' '' he said. For aspiring entrepreneurs who embrace the search fund model, he said, the likelihood of a big payoff is much greater than ''the gamble of trying to do a start-up.''
 Mr. Southern says more business school graduates are being drawn to search funds, in part because of Asurion's success and in part because the recession has diminished prospects on Wall Street and in corporate America. Nearly 25 would-be search fund entrepreneurs have approached him since November alone, he said, compared with fewer than 10 in a full year in the past. He plans to back nine funds this year, the same as in 2008 and 2007 but significantly more than the one or two a year he helped finance before that.
 Mr. Carver, co-founder of Search Fund Partners, has noticed a similar trend, with 14 candidates approaching him in the first five weeks of 2009, double the number in previous years. He says he has also seen ''a strong increase in investor interest in them,'' he said.
 He and his business partner, Rich Kelley, a former Utah Jazz basketball player, founded Search Fund Partners five years ago. He describes it as the only private equity firm to invest exclusively in search funds. 
 So far, the firm has raised close to $25 million from individuals and invested in 22 search funds, half of which have acquired companies. ''We've never had any shortage of terrific entrepreneurs to invest in,'' he said. He would not divulge specifics, but said all the capital invested in the firm's initial round of six investments was paid back by just one of them.
 Mr. Grousbeck, the Stanford professor who nurtured the first fund in 1984 when he was teaching at Harvard, says the business model has spread to Europe, Latin America, Asia and even South Africa, if only by a trickle.
 Still, search funds occupy a tiny niche of the investment world. Mr. Southern estimates that only 160 or so have been created, all looking for companies with less than $50 million in revenue. He estimated that about 60 search fund companies were active today.
 Even so, Mr. Grousbeck said, investors who back a portfolio of search funds stand a good chance of beating the returns in other markets. ''I can't tell you how many investors have asked me, 'Why should I pay somebody to hunt for a company when entrepreneurs are knocking on my door all the time to invest in theirs?' '' he said. ''I tell them, 'You'd be taking a very small risk for the chance to ride the coattails of some very bright and talented people.' ''

HEADLINE: Financial Fraud Rises as Target For Prosecutors

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
Spurred by rising public anger, federal and state investigators are preparing for a surge of prosecutions of financial fraud.
 Across the country, attorneys general have already begun indicting dozens of loan processors, mortgage brokers and bank officers. Last week alone, there were guilty pleas in Minnesota, Delaware, North Carolina and Connecticut and sentences in Florida and Vermont -- all stemming from home loan scams.
 With the Obama administration focused on stabilizing the banks and restoring confidence in the stock market, it has said little about federal civil or criminal charges. But its proposed budget contains hints that it will add to this weight of litigation, including money for more F.B.I. agents to investigate mortgage fraud and white-collar crime, and a 13 percent raise for the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Officials at the Justice Department have not said much in public about their plans. But people who have met with Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. say he is weighing a range of strategies. 
 ''It's clear that he and other top-level members of the Obama administration want to seize the opportunity to send a message of zero tolerance for mortgage fraud,'' said Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, who attended a meeting with Mr. Holder and other state attorneys general last week in Washington. ''The only question is when and how they will do it.''
 One person who had discussed the matter with Mr. Holder, but declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak for the Justice Department, said that the attorney general was deciding whether to form a task force to centralize the effort or allow state attorneys general to develop cases on their own.
 A Justice Department spokesman, Matthew A. Miller, would not comment, other than to write by e-mail, ''It will be a top priority of the Justice Department to hold accountable executives who have engaged in fraudulent activities.''
 At the low end of the mortgage transaction ladder, state prosecutors have had a relatively easy time prevailing, but recent history suggests that the government's odds of winning drop when they go after Wall Street executives. Some high-profile convictions have been won in the last decade, but several of the Enron-related prosecutions and some cases brought by Eliot Spitzer when he was New York's attorney general fell apart or were overturned on appeal.
 As federal authorities decide on a course of action, Congress is becoming impatient. Representative Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, announced plans last week for a hearing on March 20, inviting Mr. Holder, bank regulators and leaders of the S.E.C. to answer questions about their enforcement plans. 
 ''Rules don't work if people have no fear of them,'' Mr. Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said. State and local prosecutors, it seems, do not need the nudge. Last week, the district attorney's office in Brooklyn announced the creation of a real estate fraud unit, with 12 employees and a mandate to ''address the recent flood of mortgage fraud cases plaguing New Yorkers.'' In late February, Maryland unveiled a mortgage fraud task force, bringing together 17 agencies to streamline investigations.
 With all the state activity and portents of a new resolve at the federal level, lawyers who defend white-collar clients sense growing momentum to perp walk and prosecute executives involved in the mortgage crisis. 
 ''It's going to be open season,'' says Daniel M. Petrocelli, a lawyer whose clients include Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former chief executive of Enron. ''You'll see a lot of indictments down the road, and you'll see a lot of prosecutions that rely on vague theories of 'deprivation of honest services.' ''
 Many financial executives have hired lawyers in the last few months, either through internal counsels or, more discreetly, on their own, several lawyers who defend white-collar clients said. 
 While assorted Wall Street executives have been prosecuted over the years, any concerted legal attack on the financial sector would have little precedent. After the Depression, Congress formed what became known as the Pecora Commission, which grilled top financiers. But the point was mostly to embarrass them, and the upshot was to set the stage for stricter regulations. The most indelible image of the commission's hearings was a photo of J. P. Morgan Jr. with a midget who had been plopped in his lap by an opportunistic publicist. 
 The question behind any cases brought against Wall Street will boil down to this: Was the worst economic crisis in decades caused by law-breaking or some terrible, but noncriminal, mix of greed, naivete and blunders? The challenge for the Obama administration will be to prove that it was the former, said Michael F. Buchanan, a partner at Jenner & Block and a former United States attorney in New Jersey.
 ''We punish people for intentional misconduct, we don't punish them for stupidity or innocent mistakes,'' he said. ''If you're a prosecutor, you want evidence that shows real dishonesty. You want something that shows that these people were doing something wrong, and they knew it.''
 That nearly all of the banking industry acted the same, possibly reckless, way could actually help any executive who lands in court, lawyers said. The herdlike behavior suggested that bankers were competing for business using widely shared assumptions, rather than trying to get away with a crime. It would be hard to prove that anyone broke the rules, these lawyers said, since regulations in the riskiest parts of the mortgage industry were so lax. 
 One defense lawyer said he expected to argue that either his clients did not understand the financial instruments they were marketing, or were not warned of the dangers by underlings.
 ''We'll all sing the stupidity song,'' said the lawyer, who said he feared that speaking publicly by name would deter potential clients. ''We'll all sing the 'These guys never told me' song.''
 But for government lawyers, the environment for corporate fraud cases could scarcely be more inviting. It is not just that the public's zeal for Wall Street pelts is high. The resources are there, too, because some of the money once used to fight terrorism is being shifted to fighting financial fraud. And in recent years the use of wire fraud statutes has expanded, allowing prosecutors to turn virtually anything said or sent by e-mail in private into a federal crime, if it contradicts what investors were told in public disclosures. 
 Wire fraud charges were among those against two former Bear Stearns managers who were arrested in June, accused of praising their hedge fund to clients as they worried about it to colleagues. Federal sentencing guidelines also link the length of a prison term to the size of the financial loss to the public. Given that so many billions have vaporized recently, convictions could easily lead to life sentences, defense lawyers said, and the mere threat of such sentences gives prosecutors enormous leverage in settlement talks.
 ''There are executives now getting sentences longer than murderers and rapists,'' said Mr. Petrocelli, the lawyer, referring to white-collar prosecutions in recent years, including that of Mr. Skilling of Enron, who is now serving a 24-year sentence for securities fraud and other crimes. 
 Why has there not been a batch of subpoenas at the federal level already? The Department of Justice is missing important staff members, says Reid H. Weingarten, a defense lawyer and former trial lawyer for the Justice Department. Former members of the Justice Department say that prosecutors and regulators are reluctant to act while the markets are in such disarray for fear of further unnerving investors and the public.
 Lawyers for white-collar clients say they expect to be busy, but not all of them predict that means they will be earning huge fees. In the past, the legal bills of Wall Street higher-ups were paid by insurers that indemnified them. But that is not necessarily the case with banks that have gone bankrupt or disappeared.
 ''I know bankers are not now evoking much sympathy from the public at large,'' Mr. Weingarten said. ''But these days many Wall Street types are struggling mightily with mortgage payments, tuition bills and health insurance. It's a very different world out there now.''

HEADLINE: Obama Wants Global Financial Plan

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; Julia Werdigier and Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting from London.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Trying to smooth out disagreements between American and European policy makers about how to address the economic crisis, President Obama called on foreign governments on Wednesday to increase their domestic spending to stimulate their economies and asked for greater coordination of regulatory oversight.
 With finance ministers from the Group of 20 nations preparing to meet this weekend near London, disagreements have begun to emerge between the United States and other nations over whether to emphasize greater stimulus programs or more detailed changes to regulation. 
 Major European countries are divided among themselves over the wisdom of taking on more debt to combat the global downturn or to focus more on new regulations.
 In Germany, for instance, Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken about using the crisis to enact what she has called ''crucial'' reforms. The Germans have adopted a relatively modest stimulus package of about 50 billion euros ($63 billion), less than a tenth of what Congress adopted last month to help the United States economy. The French and the Japanese appear to have similar views, while the British approach seems closer to the United States'.
 Mr. Obama and his Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, told reporters that both fiscal policy and tighter regulation remained high international priorities, although administration officials have been vague about regulatory changes. The ministers, along with central bank governors, are meeting this weekend to prepare for a gathering in April of the leaders of the Group of 20 nations.
 After describing both the recent stimulus bill that he signed into law and the calls for an overhaul of the nation's regulatory system, Mr. Obama said: ''That's not just something that we want to do domestically, but we ought to make sure that we're coordinated with the other G-20 nations.''
 Meeting later in the day with reporters, Mr. Geithner repeated the message, saying leaders faced a ''global crisis which calls for a global response.'' But he appeared to be calling for some foreign governments to be more aggressive in adopting stimulus programs. 
 He said he agreed with a benchmark by the International Monetary Fund for countries to put in place fiscal stimulus of 2 percent of aggregate gross domestic product each year for 2009 and 2010. He also said the G-20 should support increasing the I.M.F.'s emergency resources by expanding a lending facility by as much as $500 billion. 
 In Europe, meanwhile, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, pledged on Wednesday to try to smooth out any disagreements between American and European policy makers about how to deal with the economic crisis.
 ''We will make progress,'' Mr. Darling said at a news conference in London. ''It's time for countries to come together and bury their differences.''
 His comments came after European Union finance ministers signaled a reluctance to spend more on reviving demand and the economy, despite calls by the United States and Britain to do so. 
 Mr. Darling played down any differences and said he believed ''the political will is there'' to agree on a coordinated plan to end the crisis. ''What we're hoping for is a multilateral agreement to be signed at the end,'' he said. 
 The government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain wants to use the meeting of the 20 advanced and emerging economies to devise a template for international cooperation and regulation, a modern-day version of the post-World War II meetings in Bretton Woods that established the I.M.F. as the economic rescuer of last resort. 
 But a feeling is growing that the agenda that Mr. Brown and Mr. Darling have set -- spurring the next leg of a coordinated global stimulus while aiming for a new regulatory architecture and a plan to reduce bonuses -- is too ambitious.
 ''Brown is possibly setting himself up for a big fall. They should have thought about setting some manageable and achievable goals,'' said Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING in London, echoing a view that is beginning to take hold in the markets that the European opposition to a prolonged spree of British-American style deficit financing will be difficult to surmount. 
 The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, cautioned Congress this week not to expect too much from the meeting.

HEADLINE: Elections in El Salvador Invoke Rivalries of Civil War Years

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN; Gene Palumbo contributed reporting.

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR 

 BODY:
El Salvador's presidential election is only days away, and prime time television here is jammed with campaign commercials featuring snappy jingles, earnest endorsements -- and President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela.
 After 20 years in power, the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance, known as Arena, faces the first real challenge to its hold on the government from Mauricio Funes, a former television talk show host who is the candidate for the left-wing F.M.L.N.
 The campaign has been vicious. Mr. Funes is popular after his years as a television journalist, so Arena does not attack him directly. Instead, it has linked the F.M.L.N., the party of El Salvador's former guerrillas, to Latin America's far-left leaders.
 Images of Mr. Chavez appear during almost every commercial break in montages of grainy clips that also feature scenes of street chaos and camouflaged soldiers. The message is less than subtle: Elect Mr. Funes as president and the F.M.L.N. will ''surrender'' the country to the socialist camp. 
 The vitriol, analysts say, stems from El Salvador's 12-year civil war, when the two parties were on opposite ends of the conflict. During the war, which ended in 1992, F.M.L.N. guerrillas fought the American-backed military, while Arena argued for a free hand in defeating them. To this day, the party anthem vows that the nation will be ''the tomb where the Reds meet their end.'' 
 ''Arena and the F.M.L.N. were born in opposition to each other,'' said Alvaro Artiga, a political scientist at the Central American University. ''This is a re-edition of the conflict.''
 The attack advertisements seem to be working. Mr. Funes, the left-wing candidate, began the campaign with a double-digit lead in polls, but he is now in a virtual tie in most of them with the Arena candidate, Rodrigo Avila, the former chief of the country's national police. 
 For his part, Mr. Funes contends that Arena is preparing to commit fraud on election day this Sunday by busing in voters from neighboring countries with fake voting cards. 
 Jose Antonio de Gabriel, the deputy chief of the European Union's election observer mission, said the electoral system had enough safeguards against any large-scale attempt at fraud. But Arena's broad support in the media, its spending advantage and the negative campaign have all contributed to what he called ''the absence of a level playing field.'' 
 There is a fear that a very close election could lead to unrest, even though both parties have abided by national and local election results before. ''If the margin is small, it will be hard for the Frente to admit a loss,'' said Roberto Rubio-Fabian, executive director of Funde, a research organization here, referring to the F.M.L.N. ''There could be a group that says this is proof that the democratic way doesn't work.'' 
 After the civil war ended, the guerrillas demobilized and entered politics. The F.M.L.N. -- officially the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front -- won town halls and seats in the Legislative Assembly, but never the presidency. 
 ''It has to be somebody like Funes,'' said Leonel Gomez, a political analyst. ''For the first time, you have somebody who's electable. He doesn't smell like a comandante.'' 
 Mr. Funes's bid has been helped by a general weariness with Arena's two decades in power. The party was founded in 1981 by Roberto d'Aubuisson, who was accused of organizing death squads during the civil war. 
 El Salvador's business elite has been the force, and the money, behind Arena, but social programs have helped it win four presidential elections. During his campaign, Mr. Avila has given away new houses, inaugurated day care centers and posed for snapshots with applicants at job fairs. 
 Still, for a business-friendly government, Arena has a middling record. Average annual growth since 1999 has been below 3 percent, according to the Inter-American Development Bank, below the rates in most of the country's neighbors. Over half of Salvadorans live in poverty, many of them in neighborhoods like La Chacra, to San Salvador's east, with its small concrete houses, tin shacks, gang violence and drugs. 
 ''In my 22 years, people have always complained about the same thing,'' said Abraham Moises Ticas, an unemployed mechanic. ''They have been governing for such a long time, but there's still no work.'' 
 Still, there is a large minority in the neighborhood that is loyal to Arena, like Ana Dinora Perez, 35. She ticked off the government programs that help her family get by on her husband's salary as a bus driver: free medicine, toys and school supplies for her two children. 
 She fears that the F.M.L.N. could turn the country into Venezuela, where she mistakenly believes a war is taking place. ''I want us to continue as we are, in peace,'' she said. 
 Juan Hector Vidal, a consultant to El Salvador's main business association, said that growth was sacrificed to Arena's emphasis on stability. In 2001, El Salvador adopted the dollar as its currency. ''They dollarized the economy at the cost of employment and production -- and of course social stability,'' he said. 
 Critics argue that Arena is a party of crony capitalism that favors a few large business interests and does not allow competition. ''Businessmen use the state to their economic advantage,'' said Hector Dada, a center-left politician advising Mr. Funes. 
 As the global recession hits, the government has fewer options. An estimated one-quarter of Salvadorans live in the United States, and the remittances they send back to support their families account for 18 percent of the country's gross domestic product. 
 Violent crime is growing, and the country's legal system is unable to stop it. Both candidates promise a raft of programs to help the poor, and for all their angry diatribes, they sound alike when they talk about creating jobs, giving public pensions to the elderly and offering help for young people. 
 But Mr. Funes's critics contend that he is merely a puppet of the former guerrillas who still hold power in the F.M.L.N., noting that his vice-presidential candidate, Salvador Sanchez Ceren, used to be a guerrilla commander. As evidence that Mr. Chavez is funneling money to the F.M.L.N. campaign, they point to a program in which Venezuela sells subsidized fuel to the party's mayors. 
 In the campaign's final days, Mr. Funes has racked up endorsements from centrists and promised to build bridges to the conservative business elite by emulating Brazil's leftist president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. ''I have to make an effort to reduce their fears,'' Mr. Funes said.
 But many minds are already made up. ''Arena has been a lover of liberty, of progress and free religion,'' said Francisco Martinez, a spare parts salesman. 
 On the other side, Manuel Ortiz is just as fervent. He just lost his factory job. ''The businessmen are fearful that change is coming,'' he said. ''They think that it will become like Venezuela and Cuba. But that's a lie.''

HEADLINE: A Tsunami of Excuses

BYLINE: By WILLIAM D. COHAN. 
William D. Cohan is the author of ''House of Cards: A Tale of Hubris and Wretched Excess on Wall Street.''

 BODY:
IT'S been a year since Bear Stearns collapsed, kicking off Wall Street's meltdown, and it's more than time to debunk the myths that many Wall Street executives have perpetrated about what has happened and why. These tall tales -- which tend to take the form of how their firms were the ''victims'' of a ''once-in-a-lifetime tsunami'' that nothing could have prevented -- not only insult our collective intelligence but also do nothing to restore the confidence in the banking system that these executives' actions helped to destroy.
 Take, for example, the myth that Alan Schwartz, the former chief executive of Bear Stearns, unleashed on the Senate Banking Committee last April after he was asked about what he could have done differently. ''I can guarantee you it's a subject I've thought about a lot,'' he replied. ''Looking backwards and with hindsight, saying, 'If I'd have known exactly the forces that were coming, what actions could we have taken beforehand to have avoided this situation?' And I just simply have not been able to come up with anything ... that would have made a difference to the situation that we faced.'' 
 Jimmy Cayne, Mr. Schwartz's predecessor, never had to testify before Congress. But he told me, with some rare humility, that before he resigned, ''there was a period of not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel .... I wasn't good enough to tell you what was going to happen.''
 Yet Dick Fuld, the longtime chief executive of Lehman Brothers, was squarely in the Schwartz camp last October when he told Congress: ''I wake up every single night thinking, 'What could I have done differently?' What could I have said? What should I have done?' And I have searched myself every single night. And I come back to this: at the time I made those decisions, I made those decisions with the information I had.'' 
 Harvey Miller, the bankruptcy lawyer who is representing what remains of Lehman, has been working hard to absolve Mr. Fuld. In a brief responding to a motion made by lawyers for the New York State comptroller, who has joined a class-action suit against the company, he wrote, ''The comptroller fails to recognize that Lehman was a victim of a financial tsunami that was beyond its control.''
 Now, wait just a minute here. Can it possibly be true that veteran Wall Street executives like Messrs. Cayne, Schwartz and Fuld -- who were paid an estimated $128 million, $117 million and at least $350 million, respectively, in the five years before their businesses imploded -- got all that money but were clueless about the risks they had exposed their firms to in the process?
 In fact, although they have not chosen to admit it, many of these top bankers, as well as Stan O'Neal, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch (who was handed $161.5 million when he ''retired'' in late 2007) made decision after decision, year after year, that turned their firms into houses of cards. 
 For instance, even though he had many opportunities to do so, Mr. Cayne never steered Bear Stearns away from an extremely heavy concentration on its hugely profitable fixed-income business. The firm starved its asset management business, its brokerage business and its investment banking business, which were not as profitable as fixed income but would have spread Bear's risk. 
 In 2003 Mr. Cayne passed on chances to diversify his firm by buying Pershing, the back office and clearing unit of Credit Suisse First Boston, and Neuberger Berman, a midsize money manager. ''Acquisitions were not my forte,'' Mr. Cayne told me. As a result, by the end, his top lieutenants stopped even trying to persuade him to diversify. 
 Mr. Cayne never seriously considered raising the firm's equity, which we now know was perilously low, nor did he seriously consider selling or merging it. Rather, he deliberately chose to take Bear deeper into the manufacture and sale of all those risky mortgage-backed securities, as well as into the business of doing trades with hedge funds. Why? Simply put, Bear's board paid him and the other four members of Bear's executive committee -- including Mr. Schwartz and another former chief executive, Alan C. Greenberg -- to maximize the firm's ''return on equity'' calculation, which is Wall Street lingo for figuring out how much money one can make using as little capital as possible. 
 This directive encouraged Mr. Cayne to make the firm as profitable as possible -- a worthy goal, no doubt -- but without raising any more cash or issuing any new stock, as doing either would increase the denominator of the return-on-equity calculation, and thereby lower the bonus pool Mr. Cayne and his executives could split among themselves.
 When viewed through this simple prism, it is not the least bit surprising that when Bear Stearns ran into trouble soon after its two hedge funds blew up in June 2007, Mr. Cayne -- and later Mr. Schwartz -- chose not to raise new equity, even though they could easily have done so back then. So Bear's balance sheet remained larded with extremely risky assets that the firm had leveraged to the hilt by borrowing cheaply in the overnight financing markets. The lenders of such money have the right to decide each day whether to continue to provide the financing or to cut the borrower off. 
 At Lehman, the facts and circumstances were somewhat different than those at Bear Stearns -- for instance, after Mr. Cayne passed on it, Lehman bought Neuberger Berman, and Lehman had built a bigger investment-banking business over the years than Bear. Yet the outcome was similar. 
 Like Mr. Cayne, Mr. Fuld had made huge and risky bets on the manufacture and sale of mortgage-backed securities -- by underwriting tens of billions of mortgage securities in 2006 alone -- and on the acquisition of highly leveraged commercial real estate. Five days before the firm imploded, Mr. Fuld proposed spinning off some $30 billion of these toxic assets still on the firm's balance sheet into a separate company. But the market hated the idea, and the death spiral began.
 Even Goldman Sachs, which appears to have fared better in this crisis than any other large Wall Street firm, was no saint. The firm underwrote some $100 billion of commercial mortgage obligations -- putting it among the top 10 underwriters -- before it got out of the game in 2006 and then cleaned up by selling these securities short. Basically, Goldman got lucky.
 When in the summer of 2007 questions began to be raised about the value of such mortgage-related assets, the overnight lenders began getting increasingly nervous. Eventually, they decided the risks of lending to these firms far outweighed the rewards, and they pulled the plug. 
 The firms then simply ran out of cash, as everyone lost confidence in them at once and wanted their money back at the same time. Bear Stearns, Lehman and Merrill Lynch all made the classic mistake of borrowing short and lending long and, as one Bear executive told me, that was ''game, set, match.''
 Could these Wall Street executives have made other, less risky choices? Of course they could have, if they had been motivated by something other than absolute greed. Many smaller firms -- including Evercore Partners, Greenhill and Lazard -- took one look at those risky securities and decided to steer clear. When I worked at Lazard in the 1990s, people tried to convince the firm's patriarchs -- Andre Meyer, Michel David-Weill and Felix Rohatyn -- that they must expand into riskier lines of business to keep pace with the big boys. The answer was always a firm no. 
 Even the venerable if obscure Brown Brothers Harriman -- the private partnership where Prescott Bush, the father and grandfather of two presidents, made his fortune -- has remained consistently profitable since 1818. None of these smaller firms manufactured a single mortgage-backed security -- and none has taken a penny of taxpayer money during this crisis. 
 So enough already with the charade of Wall Street executives pretending not to know what really happened and why. They know precisely why their banks either crashed or are alive only thanks to taxpayer-provided life support. And at least one of them -- John Mack, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley -- seems willing to admit it. He appears to have undergone a religious conversion of sorts after his firm's near-death experience.
 ''The events of the past months have shaken the foundation of our global financial system,'' Mr. Mack told Congress in February. ''And they've made clear the need for profound change to that system. At Morgan Stanley, we've dramatically brought down our leverage, increased transparency, reduced our level of risk and made changes to how we pay people.'' He continued: ''We didn't do everything right. Far from it. And make no mistake: as the head of this firm, I take responsibility for our performance.''
 Well, it's a start. But there can be no restoration of confidence in the banking system -- and therefore no hope for an economic recovery -- until Wall Street comes clean. If the executives responsible for what happened won't step forward on their own, perhaps a subpoena-wielding panel along the lines of the 9/11 commission can be created to administer a little truth serum.

HEADLINE: Europe Faulted on Too-Tepid Stimulus

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
As the evidence of economic pain mounts in Europe, a growing number of analysts say the Continent's leaders are reacting too slowly. 
 ''They are in denial, and hoping that something from the U.S. will come along to help them out,'' said Thomas Mayer, chief European economist in London for Deutsche Bank. ''The European system isn't designed for taking the unconventional policy measures that are now needed.''
 On Wednesday, President Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner seemed to add their voices to the chorus of private economists, turning up the heat on their European counterparts before this weekend's meeting of finance officials from the 20 most industrialized nations. 
 ''I think it's very important for the American people to understand that as aggressive as the actions we are taking have been so far, it's very important to make sure that other countries are moving in the same direction, because the global economy is all tied together,'' Mr. Obama said.
 Mr. Geithner added, ''Everything we do in the United States will be more effective if we have the world moving with us.''
 So far, those pleas have fallen on deaf ears. European leaders have been unwilling to ante up American-size stimulus packages and the institutions of Europe have proved ill suited to adopt the kind of fiscal policies that the Bank of England has put into place.
 Last fall, there was a burst of action as the European Central Bank cut euro interest rates in coordination with other central bank rate cuts elsewhere to stimulate growth. Since then, many countries have used bailouts to stabilize their banks. But none of that has arrested the downturn.
 On the contrary, jobless rates, traditionally higher than in the United States, have soared and are expected to rise further, especially in Spain. Unemployment in the final quarter of 2008 stood at 13.8 percent but could rise to 17.2 percent by the end of 2009 and to nearly 20 percent next year, according to Santiago Carbo, a top analyst at Funcas, a Spanish economic research foundation in Madrid.
 On Tuesday, government statistics showed that German exports plunged more than 20 percent in January, compared with a year earlier, while French manufacturing output fell nearly 14 percent.
 Now even specialists in European economic matters are pressing for bolder action. ''Collectively, Europe needs to do more,'' said Erik Berglof, chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. ''I'm concerned about whether Western Europe will do enough to revive demand, which could help the economies of Eastern Europe.''
 This week, the president of the E.C.B., Jean-Claude Trichet, spoke optimistically about a coming revival of the Continent's economic fortunes, but his own forecasters are more glum, predicting a contraction of 2 to 3 percent in 2009, and minimal growth at best next year.
 On Wednesday, Britain took the first major step in its so-called quantitative-easing program, with the Bank of England purchasing $:2 billion, or $2.8 billion, worth of government bonds. With short-term rates already at a record low of 0.5 percent, British central bankers hope this new approach will ease credit. In essence, they plan to print $:75 billion of new money over the next three months.
 This program has won praise from economists like Mr. Mayer and Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, who is now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But the rules governing the E.C.B. make it hard to replicate such a move within the 16-nation euro zone.
 That is because the E.C.B. decides monetary policy, setting interest rates while leaving fiscal policy and government spending to the 16 countries that use the euro as a currency. The E.C.B. is prohibited from directly buying government bonds.
 Still, Mr. Trichet insists that ''our hands are not tied at all.'' Mr. Johnson is deeply worried by what he calls a ''tsunami'' from Eastern Europe threatening Western Europe, even as industrial output and trade plunge across the Continent.
 ''Americans are not great, but the Europeans are very bad at contingency planning,'' he said. ''There's a fear that if you articulate it in public, the fear will become a reality.''
 So far, European stimulus efforts are only a fraction of the size of the American package.
 Mr. Mayer estimates Washington's recently approved package of deficit-financed new spending and tax cuts, which is concentrated in the next two years, equals about 6 percent of the annual gross domestic product of the United States. That stands in contrast to 2.6 percent for Germany over a comparable period. Within the euro zone, the average stimulus equals 1 to 1.5 percent of G.D.P.
 Deep historical divisions, as well as the complicated new agencies that serve as the European economy's framework, have inhibited a stronger response.
 German leaders are wary of what they see as the long-term danger of inflation if they borrow and spend too much, while Germany and other countries in the heart of Europe do not want to shoulder the burden for more troubled economies at the periphery, like Ireland or Greece.
 ''If a country were to need help, it's not clear if they should go to the European Union, the I.M.F. or the E.C.B.,'' said Philip Lane, a professor of economics at Trinity College Dublin. ''The answer seems to change day to day.''
 Europe is also spared some of the urgency felt in the United States because of the Continent's stronger social safety net, which provides universal health care and other government-supported services, softening the blow of rising unemployment. 
 That is one reason the public mood does not appear to be as bleak as in the United States and that there is less demand that politicians act quickly to right the economic situation.
 And aside from Britain, Ireland and Spain, Western Europe has not experienced the kind of housing boom and bust seen in the United States, sparing many Europeans the crushing debt burden -- and the anxiety -- of individual American consumers.
 Still, if the economy continues to deteriorate here, none of those relative comforts will matter. 
 ''Some people think they will be 10 minutes late,'' Mr. Johnson said of Europe's leaders. ''I think they're going to be 10 years too late.''

HEADLINE: HUNDREDS JAILED AS PAKISTAN BANS PLANNED PROTEST

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Salman Masood contributed reporting from Islamabad, and Waqar Gillani from Lahore, Pakistan.

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
The civilian government banned a national protest march and arrested hundreds of political workers on Wednesday, evoking for many Pakistanis the sweeping security restrictions of the military dictator, Gen. Pervez Musharraf.
 The unusually tough action deepened the popular discontent with President Asif Ali Zardari, whose six months as leader of Pakistan have been marked by a worsening insurgency by Al Qaeda and the Taliban, a weak economy and what is widely perceived as rule by an accidental leader.
 The ban also heightened the showdown between the titans of Pakistan's politics: Mr. Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto and the head of the secular Pakistan Peoples Party, who is backed by the United States; and Nawaz Sharif, a former prime minister who surveys suggest is more popular among Pakistanis but whom Washington sees as less committed to quelling the insurgency in Pakistan. 
 Mr. Zardari's government has banned gatherings of more than four people for two weeks, but Mr. Sharif vowed Wednesday to press ahead with the national protest he is spearheading in conjunction with the lawyers' movement, which has campaigned for an independent judiciary. 
 That protest now appears aimed at eventually toppling the Zardari government, because the government ban is inciting the fury of many of the same groups that helped to push Mr. Musharraf from the presidency last September. The protests built steadily after General Musharraf, then both the president and the army chief, dismissed the chief justice of the Supreme Court in March 2007. The ban on the national march bore echoes of General Musharraf's imposition of emergency rule in November 2007, several lawyers said.
 The first protesters in the nationwide march are expected to leave the city of Quetta on Thursday and converge with others from around the country on the capital, Islamabad, on Monday. 
 The political turmoil comes as Washington is conducting a major policy review on Pakistan and Afghanistan. The review is expected to extend more aid to the Zardari government to help it counter the insurgency that is increasingly destabilizing the nuclear-armed nation. 
 The minister of information, Sherry Rehman, said late on Wednesday that the government had imposed a section of the criminal code banning rallies and had arrested supporters of Mr. Sharif to preserve law and order. She called it ''unfortunate'' that the measures had to be taken. An estimated 300 political activists from Mr. Sharif's party have been arrested since Tuesday, according to the home secretary of Punjab, Rao Iftikhar Ahmed.
 The prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, met with the chief of the army, Gen. Ashfaz Parvez Kayani, on Wednesday, according to the prime minister's spokesman. General Kayani has indicated that after the nearly decade-long rule of General Musharraf, he would prefer to keep the army out of politics. But Pakistan has a history of military takeovers when civilian governments falter, and it was possible that the army would step in if the turmoil persisted, analysts said.
 Even before the ban on the march, the tensions between the Sharif and Zardari camps had been steadily increasing. 
 The senior official at the Ministry of Interior, Rehman Malik, a confidant of Mr. Zardari's, threatened this week to charge Mr. Sharif with sedition. He cited a speech by Mr. Sharif last Friday in which Mr. Sharif said the march was a good idea because it could result in revolution in Pakistan.
 Last month, Mr. Zardari imposed executive rule on Punjab, where the brother of Nawaz Sharif, Shahbaz Sharif, was the chief minister. His party held more seats in the local assembly there, and he was considered effective. 
 On Feb. 25, Pakistan's Supreme Court disqualified the Sharif brothers from holding elected office, a ruling that was widely interpreted as a political decision made at Mr. Zardari's behest.
 Mr. Zardari's move to consolidate control and the security measures imposed Wednesday served as a catalyst to rally discontent that had been festering for months over his style of governance. Mr. Zardari inherited the mantle of the Pakistan Peoples Party after his wife, Ms. Bhutto, was assassinated in December 2007. He served 11 years in jail on allegations of corruption and murder, which he says were politically motivated but that clouded his reputation.
 The party rode a sympathy vote for Ms. Bhutto to election victory in early 2008, but a coalition led by Mr. Zardari and Mr. Sharif fell apart, largely over Mr. Zardari's refusal to reinstate the former chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry.
 Many lawyers who support Mr. Chaudhry believe that Mr. Zardari's refusal to reisnstate him stemmed from a concern that the judge would revoke an amnesty on corruption charges granted by General Musharraf to Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Zardari. 
 In recent months, Mr. Zardari has isolated himself in the presidential building in Islamabad, apparently too afraid for his personal security to move around as the insurgency moves closer to the capital. Last month, Mr. Zardari's government agreed to a truce with the Taliban in Swat, 100 miles from Islamabad.
 Mr. Zardari has retained the power to dismiss the Parliament that General Musharraf had garnered for himself through a constitutional amendment. Mr. Zardari had promised to rescind that power once he became president but has not done so.
 ''During his campaign, he said he would get rid of the powers to dissolve the Parliament, '' said Farrukh Saleem, a columnist in the national newspaper, The News. ''That was going to be his first gift to the nation. He has an unending desire to control all of Pakistan.''
 Several commentators drew parallels with General Musharraf. ''Zardari is following exactly the same line as Musharraf,'' said Munawar Akhtar, a prominent corporate lawyer in Islamabad. ''By no stretch of the imagination can this regime be seen as democratic.''
 Mr. Zardari was in Tehran on Wednesday attending an economic conference as the political drama unfolded at home.
 Last November, Pakistan received a $7.6 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund to help stop a default on its debt.
 The normally cohesive public face of the Pakistan Peoples Party began to disintegrate Wednesday night. ''I say it with a very heavy heart that the government is following the same policies that were carried out by General Musharraf,'' said Iqbal Haider, the chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, and a party loyalist under Ms. Bhutto.
 Outside the party, the disgruntlement was also evident, with police officers warning supporters of Mr. Sharif's to lie low and stay away from their offices to avoid arrest. The superintendent of police in Gujranwala, in Punjab Province, refused to arrest Pakistan Muslim League workers who attended a large, emotional rally held by Shahbaz Sharif.
 Four police chiefs in local stations in Lahore were dismissed Wednesday for alerting Muslim League workers to hide, said Ashtar Ali, a lawyer for the Sharif brothers. Across Punjab, 22 police chiefs considered loyal to the Sharifs had been replaced by officers loyal to the Pakistan Peoples Party, Mr. Ali said.

HEADLINE: Weiner Steps Back, for Now, From a Race for Mayor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; Raymond Hernandez contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After delivering seemingly ironclad vows that he would run for mayor, Representative Anthony D. Weiner cast serious doubt on his candidacy on Wednesday, telling supporters that he would not decide whether to enter the race until late spring. 
 His sudden -- and very public -- ambivalence could significantly reshape the campaign. Mr. Weiner, 44, a Democratic congressman, tireless political street-fighter and dogged critic of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, has been considered a threat to the mayor's re-election.
 If he leaves the field, what many had expected to be a spirited Democratic primary could dissolve into a placid affair, with William C. Thompson Jr., the city comptroller, easily winning the nomination in the fall. 
 ''More and more, it's looking like this is not a fight that Weiner wants to take on,'' said Scott Levenson, a Democratic political consultant who is not aligned with any campaign this year. 
 In a letter to about 1,300 campaign supporters, Mr. Weiner, who has already raised about $6.6 million for the race, said he would make up his mind at the end of May, three months before the primary. At that time, he wrote, he would ''look at the lay of the land again and try to determine the best political course.'' 
 Mr. Weiner, a six-term congressman whose district covers parts of Brooklyn and Queens, told supporters that with the national economy in tatters and the city's residents looking to lawmakers in Washington for help, his focus was on Congress, not city politics. 
 ''So you won't see me holding campaign rallies. You won't see me knocking on doors asking for votes,'' he wrote. ''Simply put,'' the letter said, ''I'm doing my job.''
 The letter suggested that Mr. Weiner's supporters have become anxious about his disengagement from the campaign. In the New York City political world, the letter intensified rampant speculation that Mr. Weiner would ultimately sit out the contest for mayor. 
 Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Thompson are already hiring campaign staff and stumping around the city. But Mr. Weiner -- a disciple of Senator Charles E. Schumer, who is known for Sunday news conferences replete with color-coded billboards -- has remained on the sidelines.
 Those close to Mr. Weiner said he was crushed by the mayor's successful campaign to re-engineer the city's term limits law and seek a third term. It turned the mayor into the instant favorite and shattered Mr. Weiner's sense that the race was his.
 Yet in an interview on Wednesday night, Mr. Weiner denied that he was worried about the odds of defeating the popular mayor. ''That is not what this is about,'' he said. ''We are in a position to wage a good smart successful campaign.''
 Even some of his own contributors have their doubts, though. Asked about Mr. Weiner's letter, George S. Kaufman, a real estate developer who gave Mr. Weiner's campaign the legal limit of $4,950, attributed it to the mayor's lead in the polls. 
 ''I really don't think he could beat Bloomberg,'' Mr. Kaufman said. 
 Still, it remains possible that Mr. Weiner is trying to lie low over the next few months, only to jump into the campaign at the last minute, a strategy he has employed in the past.
 In 2005, he did not declare his candidacy until August, just a month before the Democratic primary. A similar strategy this year would allow him to avoid relentless television and radio attacks from Mr. Bloomberg, whose campaign has suggested it would spend up to $20 million just to knock Mr. Weiner out of the race. 
 ''It is not in his interest to have this campaign kick into gear early,'' said a Democrat who spoke with Mr. Weiner about the campaign but insisted on anonymity for fear of antagonizing him. ''He has limited resources,'' the person said. ''So he can't get into a shooting war with the mayor because the mayor will destroy him.''
 Sean Patrick Maloney, a former aide to Govs. Eliot Spitzer and David A. Paterson, said Mr. Weiner was wise to ''focus on substance and step back from being seen as a political animal. What people are looking for right now is problem solvers.''
 Mr. Weiner, in the interview, also said he did not intend to challenge Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand next year. 
 Mr. Weiner's letter caught both of his rivals by surprise yesterday, and their campaigns scrambled to capitalize on it, painting him as indecisive and overly concerned with his political standing. 
 Eduardo Castell, Mr. Thompson's campaign manager, said, ''Bill Thompson is running for mayor and that is what he will do,'' he said. 
 Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, said that ''for the mayor, it's not about choosing the best political course -- it's about doing the right things.''

HEADLINE: Gordon to the Rescue

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
If, as a British prime minister, you get a five-minute segment on ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,'' you know you've made it, especially when the much-loved Stewart describes your country as a place that ''gets about two hours of sunshine a year'' and resembles a ''coffee-less Seattle.''
 Stewart, as usual, had his news antennae finely tuned, lauding Gordon Brown, a man of Heathcliffian moodiness, for giving Americans a kick up the backside. He showed a clip of Brown telling a joint session of Congress that, more than the indispensable nation (Madeleine Albright's phrase), America is the ''irrepressible nation.'' 
 Now, Stewart riffed, turning to an American audience still shell-shocked by finding blue chips trading as penny stocks and their pensions disappearing faster than a sense of humor in Barack Obama's Washington: ''Get out of bed you slugger and go out and invade the sub-continent!'' 
 Nothing quite like a good war, after all, to jump-start an economy. Oops, I almost forgot, America already has two of them.
 But I digress. This is supposed to be a galvanizing column, not another of those bleeding-heart jeremiads about some insoluble problem like man's cruelty to man or the ghastly financial consequences of the herd instinct.
 Stewart featuring the unpopular prime minister of a medium-size European country where it rains a lot was a bold journalistic decision, not quite like devoting prime time or the front page to Luxembourg or Austria, but close. 
 Of course, there was the incident of the out-of-sync offerings with Brown giving Obama a pen holder carved from the timber of an anti-slave ship -- ''a gift wrapped inside a present stuffed inside a thoughtful gesture,'' as Stewart put it -- and getting a DVD box set in return (a snub wrapped inside a put-down stuffed inside bad manners).
 ''We don't define our relationship through the exchange of gifts,'' a British diplomat sniffed.
 Fair enough, I guess. But the nub of this -- and the real reason Brown made news with Stewart -- is that he gave perhaps the best political speech of his life.
 Brown's affection for America was well known. He used to holiday at Cape Cod with thick presidential biographies for company. What was not well known until this 36-minute address was how stirring, passionate and deeply felt is his love of, and faith in, the United States.
 I've been hard on Brown in the past. He came to power, without his own mandate, at the tail end of the 10-year phenomenon of New Labor. Brooding and uncertain, he tinkered and then reaped an economic whirlwind, responding at first with some panache, only to be overwhelmed and see his poll numbers plunge once again.
 But listening to his speech, I warmed to Brown and realized something: that Obama has not yet found his presidential voice. In the place of fireside chats needed to comfort and inspire a suffering population, the new president has given fireside lectures. 
 Before I get to that, however, a word more on Brown's brave moment. He evoked the shared sacrifice of the past with eloquence -- ''There is no day of remembrance in Britain that is not also a commemoration of American courage and sacrifice far from home'' -- and underscored the bond thereby forged.
 He got to the crux of the moral crisis behind the financial crisis: ''In our families and workplaces and places of worship, we celebrate men and women of integrity who work hard, treat people fairly, take responsibility and look out for others. If these are the principles we live by in our families and neighborhoods, they should also be the principles that guide and govern our economic life.''
 He tied lessons of recent months to his own family story: ''My father was a minister of the church, and I have learned again what I was taught by him -- that wealth must help more than the wealthy, good fortune must serve more than the fortunate.''
 And he delivered a resounding message of faith in a future beyond protectionism, in a world economy that will double in size over the next two decades as billions of people ''move from being simply producers of their goods to being consumers of our goods,'' not least those produced by new green technologies.
 ''So we must educate our way out of the downturn, invest and invent our way out of the downturn and re-tool and re-skill our way out of the downturn.'' 
 Right on, Gordon!
 I felt stirred and then it hit me: the president up to now has made it his chief business to tell Americans unpleasant truths -- and, yes, they are very unpleasant -- rather than galvanize through the optimism of his message.
 He has been detailing tax and other polices to narrow the gap between the haves and have-nots, but in a cool, brisk top-down language that hardly seems right to overcome division.
 It's time for some unvarnished Obama.
 That, I think, was the real story Stewart had intuited. As he noted, how desperate must things be ''when Britain is trying to cheer us up?''

PERSON: Steve Bernard 

HEADLINE: Steve Bernard, 61, Dies; Founded Cape Cod Chips

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
Steve Bernard, who was a restless adventurer and uncommitted entrepreneur until 1980, when he bought an industrial potato slicer and started Cape Cod Potato Chips, a brand that found its way from a storefront in Hyannis, Mass., to food markets nationwide, died Saturday in Hyannis. He was 61 and lived in Marstons Mills, Mass., and Sanibel, Fla.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his daughter, Nicole Bernard Dawes. 
A natural product, just potatoes, oil and salt, Mr. Bernard's chips are known for their crunch, which is a result of the way they are made. The process, called kettle-cooking, borrowed an old-fashioned method of making chips in which sliced potatoes are soaked in hot oil in a shallow basin and hand-stirred with rakes. Continuous frying, in which the potatoes were moved on a conveyor through a long vat of oil, had been largely in use after World War II.
''He didn't invent the kettle chip, but he was involved in bringing it back to prominence,'' James A. McCarthy, president of the Snack Food Association, an international trade group, said Thursday in an interview.
Mr. Bernard started the company after his wife, Lynn, opened a natural foods store in the 1970s. An avid cook and appreciative eater, he was struck by the idea that healthful, unprocessed foods could taste good. A friend gave him a natural potato chip made in Hawaii, where the manufacturer, Maui Chips, had done a solid local business for many years. Mr. Bernard presumed he could do the same thing in the East, selling healthful snacks to summer tourists.
He knew nothing about making potato chips, and the company, which opened on July 4, 1980, was in dire straits the next winter when what seemed to be a disaster turned out to be its salvation. An out-of-control car drove through the front window, where his daughter, then 8, had been standing minutes before.
Mr. Bernard was distraught, his daughter said, until an oblivious customer walked in through the wreckage and ordered a bag of chips. ''And he thought, 'Well, maybe there's a way,' '' she said.
The publicity from the accident -- and an insurance settlement -- sustained the company until summer. At its end, ''he could not make chips fast enough,'' Ms. Dawes said.
Cape Cod chips were picked up by several supermarket chains, and Anheuser-Busch bought the company in 1985. By the end of 1986, according to news reports, the company was selling 80,000 bags a day.
Stephen Francis Bernard was born in Concord, N.H., on Aug, 25, 1947. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame, where he studied economics, and then spent a decade in many pursuits: hitchhiking cross-country, fighting forest fires in Alaska, sailing to the Caribbean. He raised chickens and worked on a tuna boat. Before making chips, he was installing sun roofs in cars.
In addition to Ms. Dawes, of Chatham, Mass., and his wife, whom he married in 1971, he is survived by three brothers, Sergius, of Wenham, Mass., Jude, of Satellite Beach, Fla., and James, of Vermont; a sister, Virginia Kenny, of Charlottesville, Va.; and two grandchildren.
In 1995, Mr. Bernard bought his company back from Anheuser-Busch, but subsequently sold it again, this time to Lance, a snack food company based in Charlotte, N.C. In the interim, he had opened a sandwich shop, where he sold croutons made from the leftover bread and eventually started a crouton company, Chatham Village Foods, which he sold to the T. Marzetti Company. In 2001, he and Ms. Dawes founded Late July Organic Snacks, which makes cookies and crackers.

Museums
AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE SEDUCTION OF LIGHT,' through March 29. Comparisons may be invidious, but they can also be illuminating. Consider this small, tightly focused exhibition of portraits by the 19th-century American folk artist Ammi Phillips and paintings by the 20th-century Abstract Expressionist Mark Rothko. The presentation reveals parallel ways of dealing with surface, color and light. It also reveals two painters who were, each in his own pragmatic yet metaphysically resonant way, distinctly American artists. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
- BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'ENGLISH EMBROIDERY FROM THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART, 1580-1700,' through April 12. At once revelatory and great fun, this exhibition examines one of the world's most beloved and ancient art forms/crafts/hobbies during one of its golden ages, a time that included mind-boggling turmoil. Given the beheadings, regime changes and warring ethnic and religious factions -- outlined in the show's exemplary catalog -- it is a miracle that anybody had time for anything, much less great needlework. But it was a leading indicator of wealth and status, a means of decoration, a form of moral instruction and a sign of wifely devotion. Glass beads, pearls, raised work, applique and striped ribbons mix with an intimidating array of stitches for effects that are never less than stunning. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu. (Roberta Smith)
FRICK COLLECTION: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE NORTON SIMON MUSEUM,' through May 10. In a rare exchange that inaugurates a reciprocal loan agreement, five paintings from the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, Calif., have been temporarily installed in the Frick's Oval Room. The Simon paintings, which date from the 16th and 17th centuries, bring a whiff of fresh air into the Frick. None of the artists -- two Spaniards, two Italians and one Flemish master -- are currently represented in its collection. Of special note are Francisco de Zurbaran's ''Still Life With Lemons, Oranges and a Rose'' (1633), which has been freshly cleaned for the occasion, and Guercino's commanding portrait of an Italian count's pet mastiff, ''Aldrovandi Dog'' (1625). 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'THE HUGO BOSS PRIZE 2008: EMILY JACIR,' through April 15. The first part of this Palestinian-American conceptualist's show is a kind of walk-in scrapbook of photographs, letters, interviews and diaristic texts telling the story of Wael Zuaiter, a Palestinian intellectual who was killed by Israeli secret service agents, supposedly in retribution for the murder of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches by Palestinian terrorists during the 1972 Munich Olympic games. The second part is a memorial to Mr. Zuaiter consisting of 1,000 slender white books, into each of which Ms. Jacir shot a .22-caliber bullet. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)
- GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'THE THIRD MIND: AMERICAN ARTISTS CONTEMPLATE ASIA: 1860-1989,' through April 19. This strange, often beautiful, long-overdue show gives us, as expected, nature, cosmic consciousness and tons of Zen. But there's also enough revisionist thinking to muss up standard accounts of American modernism. Not everything works; the installation alternates blank stretches with cluttered stretches, and sculpture seems a bit tossed in. But who cares, if you have under-regarded artists like Mark Tobey, Morris Graves, Paul Kos, Natvar Bhavsar, Zarina Hashmi, Tadaaki Kuwayama, Lee Mullican, Gordon Onslow-Ford, Harry Smith, Jordan Belson, James Whitney, Linda Montano, Mark Thompson and Tehching Hsieh to contemplate? There's a lot of bliss to follow here, not the least being that the Guggenheim has, for once, defied the market and gone for a subject still little-known. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Holland Cotter)
INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 2009 YEAR OF FASHION, through May 3. Four synergistic shows inaugurate the museum's yearlong focus on fashion photography. Leading off is the snapping, crackling survey ''Weird Beauty: Fashion Photography Now'': a floor-to-ceiling, push-pull installation that clocks the genre as a fast-moving collective expression that is as esoteric as abstract art, and as startling as a sleek, hissing serpent in the drab garden of everyday reality. Stylists, in particular, shine. ''This Is Not a Fashion Photograph'' reveals faces, bodies, garments, poses and style in a century's worth of nonfashion photographs by everyone from Jacob Riis to Malick Sidibe. ''Edward Steichen: In High Fashion, the Conde Nast Years, 1923-1937'' affirms fashion photography's short but definite history by examining in detail how this pioneer more or less invented both fashion photography and celebrity portraiture while working for Vogue and Vanity Fair. ''Munkacsi's Lost Archive'' is less an exhibition than a prelude to one, but it elucidates post-Steichen developments by highlighting Martin Munkacsi, a photographer who set fashion models in motion, further blurring the line between fashion and nonfashion photography. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, www.icp.org. (Smith)
THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'CHAGALL AND THE ARTISTS OF THE RUSSIAN JEWISH THEATER, 1919-1949,' through March 22. A fascinating tale of two vanguard theater companies that flourished in Moscow for a few years after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 is told by this big, walk-in scrapbook of a show presenting more than 200 pieces of art and ephemera. Exploring the histories of the Hebrew-speaking Habima theater and the Yiddish-speaking Moscow State Yiddish Theater, the exhibition includes drawings, paintings, photographs, posters, sheet music, costumes and clips from vintage films. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Johnson)
METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CAST IN BRONZE: FRENCH SCULPTURE FROM RENAISSANCE TO REVOLUTION,' through May 24. Most of the works in this impeccably scholarly exhibition display a cold impersonality, cramped imagination and slavish obeisance to the official culture of their times. But there are compelling exceptions, including small, action-packed sculptures representing episodes in the life of Hercules by Francois Lespingola, and Jean-Antoine Houdon's ''Winter or La Frileuse,'' a heartbreakingly lovely statue of a young woman nude, except for a shawl wrapped around her bowed head and shoulders. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'PIERRE BONNARD: THE LATE INTERIORS,' through April 19. This sumptuous show presents around 40 of the interiors and still lifes that Bonnard painted between 1923 and his death early in 1947, a time usually identified with the Bather paintings that are considered his masterpieces. Those works are missed here, but not terribly. Compensation comes mainly from some nearly abstract still lifes and several large canvases in which Bonnard combines still life, interior, landscape and painting-within-painting into a fabulous optical puzzle. The images expand time through their pictorial complexity, saturated colors and shifting textures, as well as through the semi-hidden figures whose sudden appearances -- even though they've been there all along -- suggest events unfolding. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CHOIRS OF ANGELS: PAINTING IN ITALIAN CHOIR BOOKS, 1300-1500,' through April 12. The transition from medieval to Early and High Renaissance painting is told in a new way with a series of small, gemlike images that originally decorated illuminated initials in Italian choir books. The vividly colored scenes turned the initials into little stages, while running the gamut of biblical narratives. (Depictions of martyrdom were big.) They are the work of anonymous monks and of well-known painters like Lorenzo Monaco and Sano di Pietro. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE ESSENTIAL ART OF AFRICAN TEXTILES,' through April 5. This show presents 19th-century African textiles, many lent by the British Museum, alongside relevant contemporary artworks from the Met's collection. One of the most spectacular pairings matches El Anatsui's ''Between Earth and Heaven,'' a recent acquisition, with a kente prestige cloth from Ghana. The Met's 2005 exhibition ''Matisse: The Fabric of Dreams'' hinted that textiles had been undervalued in the Western canon; while the current show may not have the same blockbuster appeal, it goes deeper into the techniques and traditions that make the fabrics so striking and seductive. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'EARLY BUDDHIST MANUSCRIPT PAINTING: THE PALM-LEAF TRADITION,' through March 22. Practical features like resilience and portability help explain why books written on dried palm leaves were popular with Buddhists in eastern India between the 10th and 13th centuries. But another factor, surely, was the quality of the illustrations that accompanied the texts: exquisite figures of divinities or scenes from the Buddha's life. And few of these are as finely done and pristinely preserved as the examples in this small selection. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
- METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'RAPHAEL TO RENOIR: DRAWINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF JEAN BONNA,' through April 26. Candy box displays like this show of 120 European drawings are natural crowd pleasers, and for obvious reasons. They're very much about comparison shopping and personal taste. Relax-and-browse is their operative mode. And if they are confections, their flavor has range and intensities, from soft-center sugary to dense bittersweet. History is here if you want to find it; but if you don't, that's O.K. Enjoy. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'WALKER EVANS AND THE PICTURE POSTCARD,' through May 25. This compact exhibition, the first drawn from the museum's extensive Walker Evans archives, unforgettably illuminates Evans's lean, influential documentary style: the picture postcards he collected from age 12 onward, an ultimate collection of 9,000 examples organized by subject. The show includes some 700 arranged in expanses that bring to mind Conceptual Art. There are also examples of other Americana that Evans collected. Most visually rewarding is a smattering of his photographs, seen beside the postcards he made from them, for an unrealized project with the Museum of Modern Art. He was fearless about cropping, and often made outstanding images even better. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ON THE MONEY: CARTOONS FOR THE NEW YORKER,' through May 24. Go to this exhibition and you will see not only how money is like a cartoon, but also how cartoons shed light on money. In more than 80 drawings, the complexities of economic theory dissolve into the far more pungent currency of social relations, of status and snobbery, pretense and pride, distilling finance to its human essence. Money becomes a chit in the social game, a medium of exchange in a world careering between boom and bust. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Edward Rothstein)
- MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'PROTECTING THE WORD: BOOKBINDINGS OF THE MORGAN,' through March 29. J. P. Morgan collected omnivorously in many areas, but he might have loved books and their bindings above all else. Thus -- the recent name change notwithstanding -- he founded a library, not a museum. This sumptuous exhibition presents 55 of that library's finest bookbinding treasures, including several purchased by Morgan himself. In jeweled metalwork, tooled and mosaic leather, and illuminated and printed volumes dating from the 9th to the 20th centuries, the books and their helpful labels trace the entwined histories of a fascinating art form, the spread of human knowledge (and bibliophilia) and one of the handiest and most civilizing of humanity's inventions. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Smith)
MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'THE THAW COLLECTION OF MASTER DRAWINGS: ACQUISITIONS SINCE 2002,' through May 3. The Thaw Collection of Master Drawings, promised to the Morgan Library & Museum, has been introduced to the public in a series of exhibitions since 1975, each reflecting the latest additions by the former art dealer Eugene V. Thaw and his wife, Clare. This installment of 80 recently acquired drawings from the past five centuries is a bit smaller than the last one in 2002-3, though it includes sure-to-please works by Ingres, Gauguin and others. Many selections reflect the Thaws' passion for 19th-century German Romantic art, which may not be for all tastes. The curators make the most of this historically unbalanced group, however, sketching out a pragmatically loose chronology. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'SECOND LIVES: REMIXING THE ORDINARY,' through April 19. The inaugural show in the Museum of Arts and Design's jewel-box-like building continues its haphazard segue from a concentration on craft to a hipper, more wide-ranging program. Unfortunately, the focus is a strategy that is epidemic in the larger art world: the massing of something small (plastic spoons, ladies' pumps, spools of thread, dangling eyeglasses) into something large (a pyramid, a love seat, a view of the ''Mona Lisa,'' a chandelier). It is Surrealism 101, descended from Meret Oppenheim's beloved and far too influential fur-lined teacup. Basically, you see the thing. You see the things it is made of. Something in the way of a punch line follows. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Smith)
- MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: THE PROBLEM PERSPECTIVE,' through May 11. The career of the German artist Martin Kippenberger, who died in 1997 at 44, was a brief, bold, foot-to-the-floor episode of driving under the influence. What was he high on? Alcohol, ambition, disobedience, motion, compulsive sociability, history and art in its many forms. But art in its many forms was exactly what he made -- specifically paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, prints, posters, books -- all in madly prolific quantities. In every sense, he took up a lot of space, and he continues to in this first American retrospective, which spills out of top-floor galleries and down into the atrium. Not everything has equal punch. If messy and bad aren't your thing, and pristine objects are, he's not the artist for you. Yet in each work, the model he set for what an artist can be and do shines through. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PERFORMANCE 1: TEHCHING HSIEH,' through May 18. This small, gripping exhibition -- the first in a series dedicated to performance art -- centers on the documentation of ''Cage Piece'' (1978-79), the first of five ''One Year Performances'' by the deprivation-prone Taiwanese artist Tehching Hsieh. The piece entailed spending one year doing absolutely nothing in nearly solitary confinement in a cell-like cage, built in the artist's studio. The show includes the cell, as well as daily photographs of the artist that measure the year in the growth of his hair. Few performance pieces communicate the demands of this particular genre in such a basic, resonant way, or its ability to expand our understanding of time and space with such simple force. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
NEUE GALERIE: 'BRuCKE: THE BIRTH OF EXPRESSIONISM IN DRESDEN AND BERLIN, 1905-1913,' through June 29. The original bad boys of 20th-century German art are featured in this visually aggressive show, specifically Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Max Pechstein and their driven, putative leader, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. Together they revived a rawness of feeling, form and execution that had been largely absent from European art since the Middle Ages, but they also unleashed a palpable Dada swagger before Dada. As their dreams had not yet been trammeled by World War I, theirs was still a fairly cheerful barbarism, based on the belief that they could retrieve what was good and natural in the world if they just took off their clothes, danced around a bit and made art. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)
THE NEW MUSEUM: 'THE THREE M PROJECT: NEW COMMISSIONS,' through March. Visitors will find the New Museum strangely empty for the next few weeks. On view are just three newly commissioned works: a turgid dance film by Daria Martin (through March 22); a wall of graphics promoting the magazine Urban China (through March 29); and, by Jeremy Deller, a discussion lounge where you can speak with experts about Iraq and enjoy an educational if not artistically transporting experience (through March 29). 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through Oct. 5. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'JONATHAN HOROWITZ: AND/OR,' through Sept. 14. Andy Warhol's grandchildren, numerous beyond count, have cashed in on his rich and radical legacy to see what further possibilities it might yield. Such is the case with the New York artist Jonathan Horowitz in this smart, crisply edited retrospective. The works evoke the media-saturated art of the 1970s, the neo-conceptualist consumer art of the 1980s, and the identity art of the 1990s, landing in a Neverneverland era, in which analog is poised to turn to digital, and Doris Day and Paris Hilton have equal currency. (Cotter)
WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'ALEX BAG,' through April 12. Alex Bag's videos take aim at television in all its forms: the infomercial, the reality show, the nature documentary, even the children's programs hosted in the 1960s and '70s by Ms. Bag's mother, Carol Corbett. In her latest video, commissioned by the Whitney Museum and on view in its lobby gallery, Ms. Bag reimagines her mother's work from her own jaded 21st-century perspective. The mock show is hosted by an ''off my meds'' depressive (Ms. Bag) with narcoleptic tendencies. Its supporting cast includes a wisecracking puppet, a strung-out folk singer in a wheelchair, a creepy animal handler and a witchy doppelganger who resembles a character from Ms. Bag's 2004 video ''Coven Services.'' (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
Galleries: Chelsea
CANDICE BREITZ: 'HIM + HER' The novelty of the Hollywood movie video montage faded a while ago, but Ms. Breitz's pair of installations refresh the genre. Seven flat screens on the ''Her'' side play brief scenes of Meryl Streep acting in many different films. The other side features Jack Nicholson. Ms. Breitz's project exposes subliminal patterns of gender differentiation relentlessly projected by the movie-making industry. If Hollywood is to be believed, men truly are from Mars, and women from Venus. Yvon Lambert, 550 West 21st Street, (212) 242-3611, yvon-lambert.com, through March 21. (Johnson)
JOHAN GRIMONPREZ: 'DOUBLE TAKE' Although it lacks the urgency of ''Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y,'' ''Double Take,'' Johan Grimonprez's riveting meditation on pre-9/11 terrorism, examines the news media's role in politics and cold war fear-mongering with plenty of panache, using snippets from the Nixon-Khrushchev ''kitchen debate,'' the Cuban Missile Crisis and the space race. These alternate with an examination of Alfred Hitchcock's cameo appearances in his films and television show, tying notions of doubleness, mistaken identities and political rivalries into some very interesting cinematic knots. Sean Kelly Gallery, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, skny.com; through March 21. (Smith)
'MANZONI: A RETROSPECTIVE' In 1961 the Italian artist Piero Manzoni (1933-1963), a child of Dada and a father of Conceptualism, canned his feces and made the news. Yet his career has been something of a mystery in the United States: familiar, sort of, from books, but fuzzily grasped and seldom seen or considered. Maybe that's why Gagosian's show, which is basically a full-dress museum exhibition in a gallery, feels like such an amazement, so fresh. It not only gives us the elusive Manzoni himself, but also a sampling of some of his international contemporaries, including de Kooning, Pollock and Lucio Fontana. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com, through March 21. (Cotter)
Galleries: Other
'THE SPACE OF THE WORK AND THE PLACE OF THE OBJECT' This interesting but confusing show addresses, according to a news release, ''the status of the art object within the context of its production.'' Among the obliquely conceptual works by nine artists, the most compelling is an installation by Michael Rakowitz documenting a project in which he opened a storefront in Brooklyn to sell food products from Iraq. Simon Starling, Walead Beshty, Blake Rayne and Melanie Gilligan are among the other participants. SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, through March 22. (Johnson)
'DAMAGED ROMANTICISM' The theme of this group show will be familiar to viewers of the 2006 Whitney Biennial, ''Day for Night,'' and the New Museum's 2008 group show ''After Nature.'' Those exhibitions struck a political and environmental chord, one that echoes faintly here. Many works hint at apocalyptic fantasies, or what the curators call ''an aftermath aesthetic.'' Some choices feel too predictable (Edward Burtynsky and Sophie Calle), others glamorously irrelevant (Wangechi Mutu and Angelo Filomeno). Jesper Just's videos are a bright spot, reminding us that good artists (the original Romantics included) have always been able to accommodate conflicting emotions. The show, which originated at the Blaffer Gallery at the University of Houston, is now split between two museums. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart, through April 4. Also at the Parrish Art Museum, 25 Job's Lane, Southampton, (631) 283-2118, parrishart.org, through April 12. (Rosenberg)
Out of Town
NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'POMPEII AND THE ROMAN VILLA: ART AND CULTURE AROUND THE BAY OF NAPLES,' through March 22. This show about the opulent lifestyle of the Roman elite before the A.D. 79 eruption of Vesuvius includes recent discoveries on view in the United States for the first time, as well as finds from excavations dating to the mid-18th century. The galleries unfold according to the floor plan of a typical villa, and the installation -- which includes decorative columns, wall borders, living plants and reproductions of mosaics -- works hard to maintain the illusion of classical architecture. The exhibition moves from artifacts reflecting ancient Romans' infatuation with Greek culture to the rediscovery of Pompeii by 18th-century Europeans, suggesting that every culture finds affirmation of its taste and sophistication in a previous golden age. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Rosenberg)
- NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'PRIDE OF PLACE: DUTCH CITYSCAPES OF THE GOLDEN AGE,' through May 3. There is nothing like a beautiful city, and there are several, lovingly painted, in this quiet, gorgeous exhibition. The display of 48 paintings, 22 maps and assorted atlases and printed books includes works by Jan van Goyen, Gerrit Berckheyde, Jan van der Heyden, Jacob van Ruisdael and other preternaturally skillful painters of intensely realistic yet idyllic images of cities and towns viewed from far and near. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)
Last Chance
'THE CEDAR BAR' The inspiration and centerpiece of this homage to the Cedar Bar, a favorite Greenwich Village watering hole of the Abstract Expressionists, is its dilapidated neon sign, salvaged by the sculptor Salvatore Scarpitta and converted into a sentinel-like artifact. The exhibition also includes art by some of the bar's denizens -- Willem de Kooning, Nicolas Carone, Joan Mitchell, Jackson Pollock, Herman Cherry and Franz Kline -- and photographs of them taken in their heyday by Fred W. McDarrah and Arthur Swoger. It all seems to glow in the implied light of the sign. Washburn Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-6780, washburngallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
NANCY HAYNES: 'DISSOLUTION' In this crazy, mixed-up world, art can provide a place of stillness and quiet, a pit stop for weary souls. In the tradition of artists like Mark Rothko and Ad Reinhardt, Nancy Haynes creates beautiful, meditative, near-Minimalist paintings in which lovingly brushed surfaces give way to cosmic spaces of light-infused darkness. Elizabeth Harris Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-9666, elizabethharrisgallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
ALEX MELAMID: 'HOLY HIP-HOP!' Mr. Melamid was once a Russian dissident artist and half the team of the visual satirists Komar and Melamid. His subjects, painted life-size in a kitschy, Rembrandtesque manner, are famous hip-hop musicians: Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent and Kanye West, among others. The expert imitation of a hackneyed, old masterish style makes you wonder if the artist is mocking something or someone. His intentions appear fuzzy, and so the paintings have less bite than they should. Forum Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 355-4545, forumgallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
- METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'BEYOND BABYLON: ART, TRADE, AND DIPLOMACY IN THE SECOND MILLENNIUM B.C.' This big, prescient, concentration-taxing exhibition is the latest in the Met's line of investigative archaeological shows, and it is not geared to quick-take viewing. Many of the objects are small and intimate, made to be worn, handled and easily transported. A proliferation of wall texts gives the show the pace of a lavishly illustrated book. Patient viewing is rewarded by a fascinating story of a proto-global world in formation nearly 4,000 years ago. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)
MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'A SHIMMER OF POSSIBILITY: PHOTOGRAPHS BY PAUL GRAHAM' The latest project from the British photographer Paul Graham is a quietly radical update of the Great American Road Trip. Mr. Graham, born in 1956, grew up looking at Robert Frank, William Eggleston and the photographers of the New Topographics movement. Yet ''a shimmer of possibility'' rejects the linear, automobile-centric narrative of the 1960s and '70s in favor of a looser, more open-ended structure, one that Mr. Graham has aptly called ''filmic haiku.'' Notably, it also focuses on Americans who are of modest means or visibly struggling, in cities like Pittsburgh, New Orleans and Las Vegas. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Wednesday. (Rosenberg)
'POPULATE THIS FORM' The phrase used to be ''complete this form,'' but never mind. This makes a great title for this vivacious exhibition of rectangular surfaces or rectilinear, wall-mounted objects, all populated (usually painted) with repeating, mostly abstract elements. The 16 artists include John Torreano, Cary Smith, David Moreno, Nancy Shaver, Mamie Holst, Bill Komoski and Josh Podoll. The coherence and the diversity within it are impressive. Feature Inc., 276 Bowery, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 675-7772, featureinc.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
JOSH SMITH: 'CURRENTS' In two standard sizes, 38 paintings hang cheek by jowl, creating a wrap-around, decorative effect. Some depict fish, leaves and other natural objects in a clumsily exuberant, expressionist manner. Others involve blurry, digital prints glued onto panels in grids. You may discover passages of beauty and insouciant verve, but the overall impression is tiresomely kitschy, as if Mr. Smith meant not to make good paintings but to mock cliches of Modernist aesthetics. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9100, luhringaugustine.com; closes on Saturday.
(Johnson)
STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: BARKLEY L. HENDRICKS: 'BIRTH OF THE COOL' He did not birth the cool -- that was Miles Davis -- but Mr. Hendricks's suave portraits from the 1960s, '70s and early '80s give him the right to use this title for his five-decade retrospective. Mixing realism, abstraction and Pop, Mr. Hendricks's life-size paintings of beautiful black people in extravagantly fashionable outfits captured a period sensibility with uncanny acuity. Today, with portrait painters like Kehinde Wiley, Elizabeth Peyton and Chuck Close enjoying great popularity, Mr. Hendricks's work is back in style. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Johnson)
- 'THEY TAUGHT THEMSELVES: AMERICAN SELF-TAUGHT PAINTERS BETWEEN THE WORLD WARS' Many of the artists introduced by Sidney Janis's groundbreaking book ''They Taught Themselves: American Primitive Painters of the 20th Century'' are in this excellent show, including painters who are now well known, like John Kane and Grandma Moses, and less famous ones like Joseph Pickett and Patsy Santo. Patrick J. Sullivan's painting of two men burying a murder victim while a maniacal dwarf with monstrously elongated fingers and toes watches exudes a hair-raising, darkly comical mystery. Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 245-6734, gseart.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)

''Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese: Rivals in Renaissance Venice'' opens on Sunday and remains on view through Aug. 16 at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 465 Huntington Ave.; ticket information, (800) 440-6975, mfa.org.

 BODY:
BOSTON -- You can pretty much kiss goodbye, at least for now, the prospect of more exhibitions like ''Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese: Rivals in Renaissance Venice,'' which opens Sunday at the Museum of Fine Arts here. Transatlantic loans of the kind that make this show the breathtaker it is are a big drain on strapped museum budgets. Boston was lucky to partner with the Louvre on this project, but such masterpiece gatherings are likely to be rare in years to come. Catch them while they're hot.
Hot is the word for this show. Devotional ardor radiates from monumental church paintings. In a gallery of female nudes with skin so incandescent as to barely need lighting, eroticism floats like a scent. For the first time in European art we see paint itself used as an impassioned material, the instrument of fervid hands and inflamed personalities.
The show is about three such personalities: Tiziano Vecellio, or Titian; Jacopo Robusti, known as Tintoretto; and Paolo Caliari, called Veronese. All three shot off sparks as they reforged painting as a medium. And all three had feverishly competitive overlapping careers. 
These masters of 16th-century Venetian painting were no Holy Trinity. They were a discordant menage-a-trois bound together by envy, talent, circumstances and some strange version of love.
This is the story the exhibition tells through 56 grand to celestial paintings -- no filler here, not an ounce of fat -- sorted into broad categories (religious images, portraits, belle donne) and arranged in compare-and-contrast couplings and triplings to indicate who was looking at whom, and why, and when. And that story is set against a larger historical narrative that goes something like this.
Before the 16th century Italian art was dominated by two cities, Florence and Rome, and by two kinds of painting: fresco and egg tempera -- water-based, fast-drying, smooth-surfaced -- on wood. Venice lay outside this mainstream. Fresco wasn't viable in the city's humid atmosphere; tempera had problems too. Then, at the end of the 15th century, oil painting, still little known in the rest of Italy, was introduced, and Venetian art caught fire.
Giovanni Bellini (1431-1516) was the cusp figure. A single painting by him of the Virgin and Child with four saints, dated around 1505, opens the Boston show. It is done in both tempera and in oil on wood. Another painting on the same theme and of a slightly later date hangs beside it. This one is by Titian (1480-1576), a Bellini pupil. It is in oil on canvas, which demonstrates a revolution in progress.
Bellini's figures, probably painted in part by assistants, are still quattrocento cutouts with colors filled in. Their connections to one another are vague; no one seems to quite know how he or she ended up in the same picture. Titian's grouping is an organic merging of shadow and light; figures gaze at one another, rapt. Bellini's palette hovers, soft and pale, in the ether; Titian's is loam-dark, with the red of the Virgin's robe as startling as a spill of roses or rubies turned up in the earth.
The oil-on-canvas format had other far-reaching practical consequences. With it artists could produce fresco-size pictures, much in demand for courts and churches, that were portable. Painters no longer had to relocate to Rome or Madrid for big-dollar gigs. They could work at home and mail the art in.
Also, oil paint was physically different from other paint. Because it was slow drying, artists could rethink and revise as they went. (The show has a fascinating section on pictures buried under other pictures.) And its controllable density and weight allowed each stroke to leave a distinctive and volatile trace, like the ink line in handwriting.
As a result people began to pay attention to brush styles, not just as indicators of skill but as evidence of an artist's emotional presence. At a certain point Titian stopped signing his pictures. The way he used paint was identification enough, even as it changed over his long career, from Bellinian polish to an expressive rawness -- see his scraped and scratched late ''Entombment'' -- that Goya and countless later artists would emulate.
At the same time, such a personalized, implicitly egocentric mode went against a Venetian social ethic. Officially, La Serenissima placed supreme value on harmony and equanimity. Public art commissions were scrupulously distributed among many artists; assignments were by committee, not charisma.
Titian, and the oil medium he mastered, turned the page on that. When it came to adorning the city's churches and all-powerful confraternities, as well as for painting state portraits or soft-porn fantasies for private delectation, he was the artist of choice.
And his reputation spread. Kings and pontiffs lined up for his services -- his famed portrait of Pope Paul III, coiled like an aged cobra in his velvet cape, is in the show -- and patiently awaited his reply. It could be slow in coming. Titian worked on Titian time. Like any grand divo he set the tempo. He had the stage to himself.
Then in the mid-1540s he didn't. Tintoretto charged onto the scene, with a new style, aesthetic and personal. Whereas Titian was known for gentlemanly comportment, the newcomer -- his father was a dyer, hence the nickname -- purveyed an abrupt, aggressive glamour. You can see it in his early self-portrait. All dark curls and glowering eyes, he looks like a greaser prince.
The portrait is dated 1546. Tintoretto was around 30 and on his way to becoming a star. By the time he painted ''St. George, St. Louis and the Princess'' for a government building on the Rialto, he was one. Formally the picture is a sparkler, as rich with reflected light as Venice itself. It was also a scandal. Saints preening like boys in the piazza. A princess riding a dragon, for heaven's sake. Loved and loathed, the picture had everyone buzzing, and had Titian losing some sleep.
The two artists became almost instant enemies. Titian used his influence to steer commissions away from his young rival. Tintoretto made it his business to be the un-Titian of Venetian painting, often adopting the older artist's style only to exaggerate, even mock it.
Such attacks can be uncomfortable to encounter first hand, as we do in the side-by-side hanging of Titian's tranquil, tender ''Supper at Emmaus,'' with its forget-me-nots strewn on the table, and Tintoretto's pointedly squirmy, sloppy version of same scene from a few years later. Some say that Tintoretto's art often looks best from a distance and disappoints up close. Here, as if with Titian as a target, he seems to be making an extra effort to look not-good. (The contribution of assistants helped with this.) And surely there is testimony to deep attachment in so negative an homage.
Finally into the arena strode a third giant, and a somewhat gentler one, Veronese (1528-88). Named for his native city and still in his teens when he hit Venice, he was quickly acknowledged to be a prodigy, fully formed. Titian became the artist he was through long growth, Tintoretto by sifting and synthesizing influences. Veronese was Veronese from Day 1.
Ingratiating in manner, he was a painter of fine texture, sweet color and courtly reserve. Patrons who found Tintoretto too outlandish gave Veronese their business; the elderly Titian took him under his wing. And from the 1540s to the 1580s Venetian painting became a three-way dance among these three men, a tricky choreography of emulation and rejection, dependence and separation.
You can follow the moves in a cluster of steamy paintings of nudes at the center of the show, installed in a gallery with crimson walls and tasseled curtains. The Titians -- the ''Danae'' from the Capodimonte Museum in Naples, ''Venus with an Organist and Dog'' from the Prado, ''Venus With a Mirror'' from the National Gallery of Art in Washington -- are stop-and-stare fantastic.
Scarcely of less interest, though, are the Titian riffs around them. Tintoretto turns the ''Danae'' into a clever joke, then, as if realizing he's wasting his talent, paints an image of ''Susannah and the Elders'' so surrealistically sensual it all but clears the room. Veronese bends over backward to work out his own Titianesque Venus. He gets the anatomy wrong, but the details are so brilliantly right -- the jewels, the embroidery, that gorgeous block of bare flesh -- you don't care.
But the most moving display of influence comes at the end of the show and in the reverse generational direction, when the revered master is seen taking lessons from one of his juniors.
Tintoretto, for all his showmanship, had a capacity for egoless empathy when it came to depicting religious subjects of tragic import. A little-seen ''Deposition of Christ,'' hauled out of storage in Venice and restored for this exhibition, is a fine example, with its swooning diagonals, sudden colors and pale faces picked out in light.
The picture is thought to date from the mid-1550s. At the end of the decade, in 1559, comes a painting on a related theme, the ''Entombment of Christ,'' composed of similar diagonals, with the same sudden colors and with a comparable, if slightly brightened, play of light and shade. But this one is by Titian, by then moving into the final stretch of his career.
Could he have seen the painting of his rival and absorbed its power? If not, he had certainly seen other Tintorettos. The first thing you notice about Titian's ''Entombment'' is how loose and impulsive the brush style is, how broadly conceived the forms; how close the picture is, in its sweep and almost heedless verve, to Tintoretto. Could it be that a style once used by the younger to ape the older has not only hit its mark but stuck there, that Titian has made it his own?
That is one of many speculative fires ignited by the show, organized by Frederick Ilchman, assistant curator of European painting at the Museum of Fine Arts, and by Jean Habert and Vincent Delieuvin, curators at the Louvre. There are many more fires.
Some will be fanned into life by Renaissance scholars in the future. Others, like the account of the origins of oil painting as a subjectively loaded and commercially privileged medium, cast a searching light on a market-addled present.
Such perspectives are among the rewards that exhibitions bring, at least if they are astutely thought out and lovingly realized. The economy may no longer favor international loan shows like this one, but our own museums, with their rich collections, can, working cooperatively, produce spectacular things. Whenever such gifts arrive, wherever they come from, treasure them.

-'THE CLASS' (No rating, 2:08, in French, with English subtitles) An artful, intelligent, heartfelt fiction film from the director Laurent Cantet about modern French identity and the attempt to transform young students of all sizes, shapes and colors into citizens through talk, talk, talk. (Manohla Dargis)
'CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC' (PG, 1:40) Like the flailing American economy, this comedy with Isla Fisher wants to eat its conspicuous-consumption cake and have its spiritual redemption too. (Dargis)
- 'CORALINE' (PG, 1:40) Henry Selick's adaptation of Neil Gaiman's novel is exquisitely beautiful and creepy in the best ways. (A. O. Scott) 
'CROSSING OVER' (R, 1:53) Wayne Kramer takes on immigration in a politically tinged drama with Harrison Ford and Cliff Curtis, which delivers its sanctimony with fist shaking, lurid violence and periodically bared female flesh. (Dargis)
'THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON' (PG-13, 2:47) A hothouse blossom of romance, intrigue and breathtaking digital effects from David Fincher (''Zodiac,'' ''Fight Club''). Brad Pitt stars as a man who ages backward, but it is Cate Blanchett who provides the film's delicate, graceful emotional center of gravity. (Scott)
'DELHI-6' (No rating, 2:20, in Hindi and English) Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's ambitious film means to be nothing less than a referendum on the modern Indian soul. Sadly, the movie is bogged down by its own good intentions, though Abhishek Bachchan does his best to keep things light. (Rachel Saltz)
'DOUBT' (PG-13, 1:44) Adapted by John Patrick Shanley from his stage play, this drama about a Roman Catholic priest suspected of child molestation stars a tamped-down Philip Seymour Hoffman as the accused and an energetic, often wackily comic Meryl Streep as his accuser. (Dargis)
'EVERLASTING MOMENTS' (No rating, 2:11, in Swedish) The story, about a working-class wife and mother in early-20th-century Sweden who finds a measure of fulfillment by mastering the art of photography, is a bit familiar and sentimental, but strong acting and an understated visual elegance from the director Jan Troell make this a better-than-average literary costume drama. (Scott)
'EXAMINED LIFE' (No rating, 1:28) In this alternately interesting and vexing documentary, a handful of famous philosophers walk and talk, explaining their thinking on camera. (Scott)
'EXPLICIT ILLS' (R, 1:27) In this earnest, episodic tale, the first-time director Mark Webber unites various Philadelphians living, working and often struggling in the same neighborhood. (Dargis)
'FADOS' (No rating, 1:28, in Portuguese) The veteran director Carlos Saura creates a rousing, often stirring celebration of fados, the soul music of Portugal, that's both a tribute and a performance archive. (Dargis)
'FIRED UP!' (PG-13, 1:29) Two teenage boys attend cheerleading camp. Puppy love, nubile flesh and unexpectedly funny jokes follow. (Dargis)
'FRIDAY THE 13TH' (R, 1:30) An undying slasher-flick franchise gets a surprisingly decent reboot in this stylish, playful example of the decapitated-hottie genre. (Nathan Lee)
- 'FRONTIER OF DAWN' (No rating, 1:46, in French) Love is a universe of two in Philippe Garrel's fatalistic romance, which centers on a young photographer (Louis Garrel, the filmmaker's son), and the two women with whom he finds and loses love. (Dargis)
'FROST/NIXON' (R, 2:02) It's twinkle (Michael Sheen) versus glower (Frank Langella) in Ron Howard's amusing, facile edition of the Peter Morgan theatrical smackdown. (Dargis)
'FROZEN RIVER' (R, 1:37) Venturing deep into the trenches where hard-working Americans struggle to put food on the table, Courtney Hunt's powerful, somber film evokes a perfect storm of present-day economic and social woes. Playing an impoverished mother of two who smuggles illegal aliens across the Canadian border, Melissa Leo gives an awards-worthy performance. (Holden)
- 'GOMORRAH' (No rating, 2:15, in Italian) Based on the 2006 expose of the same title by the Italian journalist Roberto Saviano, this corrosive, ferociously unsentimental fictionalized look at organized crime from the director Matteo Garrone is also a bracing corrective to the sentimentalized Mafia thug popularized on both the big and small screens. (Dargis)
- 'GRAN TORINO' (R, 1:56) Once again Clint Eastwood shows everyone how it's done, with a sleek muscle car of a movie set in that industrial graveyard called Detroit about a racist who befriends a besieged Hmong family next door. (Dargis)
'HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU' (PG-13, 2:12) And neither am I. (Dargis)
'HOTEL FOR DOGS' (PG, 1:40) Children and dogs: those two magic words distill the appeal of this cuter-than-cute, sweeter-than-sweet family film about animal-loving kids who embark on a crusade to rescue all the stray pooches in a fictional city. (Holden)
'THE INTERNATIONAL' (R, 1:58) A murderous bank, pursued by Clive Owen and Naomi Watts. Much less interesting, and also less frightening, than a daily perusal of the business pages. (Scott)
'JONAS BROTHERS: THE 3-D CONCERT EXPERIENCE' (G, 1:16) Strictly for the cult. (Lee)
'KATYN' (No rating, 2:01, in Polish) The great Polish filmmaker Andrjez Wajda's film is a dignified, somber reckoning with one of the central traumas of his nation's history: the massacre by the Soviet Army of nearly 15,000 Polish officers during the first months of World War II. (Scott)
'LA BELLE PERSONNE' (No rating, 1:37, in French) Madame de Lafayette's 1676 novel ''La Princesse de Cleves,'' a staple of high school French classes, has been updated by Christophe Honore (''Les Chansons d'Amour'') and set in a modern French high school. Not much is gained in the translation, and the film is tonally confused, though the attractiveness of the cast makes it pleasant enough to watch. (Scott)
'LAST CHANCE HARVEY' (PG, 1:38) Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson don't make a lot of sense as a screen couple, but there's something irresistible about watching two people fall in love, even in contrived, sniffle- and sometimes gag-inducing films like this one. (Dargis)
- 'LET THE RIGHT ONE IN' (No rating, 1:54, in Swedish) A charming and chilling Swedish love story directed by Tomas Alfredson about a lonely boy and the girl next door who may just happen to be a vampire. (Dargis)
- 'MILK' (R, 2:08) Gus Van Sant's film about Harvey Milk (1930-78), the San Francisco City supervisor who was one of the first openly gay elected officials in the country, is less a standard biopic than a sharp, lyrical history lesson, touching not only on a crucial decade in the gay-rights movement but also on the rough and tumble of big-city politics and the tricky ways of love. Sean Penn outdoes himself as Milk, balancing his intense conviction with an unusual and welcome playfulness. The large supporting cast is also excellent, and includes James Franco as Milk's lover and campaign manager, and Josh Brolin as Dan White, Milk's colleague on the Board of Supervisors and also his murderer. (Scott)
'PAUL BLART: MALL COP' (PG, 1:30) Fat people are funny. Fat people who run into things are funnier. Fat people who run into things and have humiliating working-class jobs? Stop, you're killing me! (Lee)
'PHOEBE IN WONDERLAND' (PG-13, 1:36) This tremblingly sensitive family drama, which decomposes in its last half-hour, examines the difference between the growing pains of a gifted child (Elle Fanning) and the possibility of more serious mental illness. (Holden)
'THE PINK PANTHER 2' (PG, 1:32) Hoary slapstick routines, invariably rushed and only marginally funny, are all there is in this disorganized hodgepodge of juvenile pranks starring an overstressed Steve Martin. (Holden)
'PUSH' (PG-13, 2:01) Navigating a Hong Kong bristling with partly constructed skyscrapers, a telekinetic (Chris Evans) and a clairvoyant (Dakota Fanning) hunt for a mysterious suitcase while dodging a pair of Chinese brothers whose screams can pop blood vessels. Paul McGuigan directs with maximum efficiency and minimum reliance on computers, creating a landscape crawling with mind controllers and human bloodhounds. The only ability in short supply is acting. (Jeanette Catsoulis)
- 'RACHEL GETTING MARRIED' (R, 1:54) Anne Hathaway plays Kym, furloughed from rehab to attend her sister Rachel's wedding. The director, Jonathan Demme, working from a script by Jenny Lumet, takes a fairly conventional family-therapy drama and packs it with exuberant vitality. There is ample sorrow and recrimination at this party, but nonetheless you'll be sorry when it ends. (Scott)
'THE READER' (R, 2:03) You have to wonder who, exactly, wants or perhaps needs to see another movie about the Holocaust that embalms its horrors with artfully spilled tears and also asks us to pity a death camp guard. Kate Winslet plays the guard; Stephen Daldry directs. (Dargis)
'REUNION' (No rating, 1:30) A group of successful, self-absorbed Yale alumni reunite for a follow-up session of their ''program'': frank biological confession followed by blunt group analysis. Hermetic, stagy and less cathartic for the audience than for the actors, who relish their chance to showboat without the usual distractions of a narrative feature. (Lee)'REVOLUTIONARY ROAD' (R, 1:59) Sam Mendes directs Kate Winslet and a fine Leonardo DiCaprio in a waxworks edition of the corrosive, furiously unsentimental novel by Richard Yates about an unhappy marriage in the mid-1950s. (Dargis)
'SHERMAN'S WAY' (No rating, 1:37) Placing an elitist Yalie (Michael Shulman) and a washed-up Olympian (James Le Gros) in a stolen MGB roadster, Craig Saavedra's odd-couple road movie generates surprising warmth from familiar tropes. Shot mostly in the verdant sweep of California's wine country, this gentle exploration of dashed hopes is buoyed mainly by a superb supporting cast and the shaggy charm of Mr. Le Gros. (Catsoulis)
'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE' (R, 2:00) A modern fairy tale from Danny Boyle (''Trainspotting'') about a pauper angling to become a prince, this sensory blowout largely takes place amid the squalor of Mumbai, India, where lost children and dogs sift through trash so fetid that you swear you can smell the discarded mango as well as its peel. (Dargis)
'13B' (No rating, 2:10, in Hindi and Tamil) An overstuffed Bollywood fright flick in which, upon moving into their new apartment, the titular 13B, a new TV show reveals, in typical cliffhanger format, that a family's lives may be in danger. (Laura Kern)
'TOKYO!' (No rating, 1:52, in Japanese) A cramped metropolis of xenophobes and eccentrics living in a futuristic present: that is the image of the Japanese capital city evoked in ''Tokyo!,'' a compendium of three surreal shorts whose relationship with one another might best be defined by the exclamation point in the title. (Holden)- '12' (PG-13, 2:39, in Russian and Chechen) In Nikita Mikhalkov's grandiloquent remake of ''12 Angry Men,'' the elements of that modest courtroom classic have been enlarged to operatic dimensions. The jurors charged to determine the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murder form a composite portrait of post-Soviet Russia. (Holden)
- 'TWO LOVERS' (R, 1:48) A ripe, old-school romantic melodrama, with Joaquin Phoenix as a young Brooklyn man torn between the pull of duty and the dream of escape, and also between the title figures, played by Vinessa Shaw and Gwyneth Paltrow. With Isabella Rossellini as a Jewish mother beyond Alexander Portnoy's wildest dreams. (Scott)
'TYLER PERRY'S MADEA GOES TO JAIL' (PG-13, 1:43) Not that jail can contain her, though neither can Mr. Perry's somewhat threadbare melodrama-meets-comedy formula. (Scott)
- 'VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA' (PG-13, 1:36) A rueful comedy from Woody Allen about two young American women (Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall) who, during a summertime European idyll, savor numerous Continental delicacies, some provided by the equally alluring Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. (Dargis)
- 'WALTZ WITH BASHIR' (R, 1:27) Ari Folman's animated documentary about Israeli soldiers haunted by memories of the 1982 Lebanon war is part memoir, part dream, part combat picture and altogether amazing. (Scott)
'WATCHMEN' (R, 2:40) Who watches them? Lots of people, I guess. The real question is why. (Scott)- 'THE WRESTLER' (R, 1:45) Mickey Rourke, with sly, hulking grace, stars as a washed-up wrestler hoping for a comeback. But like its hero, the movie has a blunt, exuberant honesty, pulling off even its false moves with conviction and flair. (Scott)

AROUND TOWN
BEARD AND MUSTACHE CHAMPIONSHIP
Facial hair may be de rigueur in certain irony-loving neighborhoods in the city, but around the country it can still be a badge of ne'er-do-wells. ''We call it beardism,'' said Matthew Saccoman, a high school teacher from Meriden, Conn., known to his friends as Beardzzz. So when Mr. Saccoman, 31, came to watch the inaugural New York City Beard and Mustache Championship in 2006, he felt a sudden sense of kinship. ''The camaraderie, just being in a place where I was finally welcomed and appreciated for the way I look,'' was inspiring, he said. 
So much so that, after the founders, Jon Friedman and Jon Bulette, did not continue the contest, Mr. Saccoman decided to organize his own event. The second Beard and Mustache Championship will take place on Saturday at Public Assembly in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Mr. Saccoman said he spent thousands of dollars on the event; his wife, Cynthia, contributed graphic design. ''I wouldn't call her pro-beard,'' Mr. Saccoman said, laughing. His current growth is about five inches long. ''It's fabulous,'' he said. ''It's hard to describe your own beard, but if I had to, I'd say it's sort of bird's nest.''
About 70 contestants (including Jack Passion, above) from around the country will compete for the $500 grand prize, testing their follicles in categories like full beard freestyle, patchy beard, recession beard and ladies' artificial. Goatees, sideburns and mustaches will also be represented. ''We're all about respect,'' Mr. Saccoman said; he also hopes to recoup his investment. Entertainment includes a ZZ Top cover band, the Beards of Comedy troupe and a female burlesque act. How will nonbearded spectators feel?
''Naked,'' he said. ''When they walk out, they might consider attempting a beard or a mustache. That's one of our goals.''

BYLINE: By ALAN LIGHT

DATELINE: NASHVILLE 

 BODY:
Jack White, the meticulous frontman of the color-coordinated White Stripes, has always been known for his attention to detail. So it was no surprise to see that at the new headquarters here for his company Third Man Records everything from the vintage appliances in the kitchen area to his office door (labeled ''John A. White III, D.D.S. -- Family Dentistry'') clearly bore his touch.
 The party at the offices on Wednesday night was equally well designed. Though the invitation indicated only that the event was the ''Grand Opening'' of the company, the 150 fans, friends and media people who showed up had come for the debut of Mr. White's newest band, the Dead Weather, with Alison Mosshart of the London duo the Kills as its lead singer. The project adds to the juggling Mr. White already performs between the White Stripes and his work with a second band, the Raconteurs. 
 The Third Man operations are housed in a small warehouse, painted in primary colors, in an industrial neighborhood several blocks south of the city's Lower Broadway honky-tonk district. It's next door to an auto repair shop and across the street from a homeless shelter. Before playing the Dead Weather's album, ''Horehound,'' Mr. White welcomed guests to his ''new bear cave away from home,'' and said the building would include a rehearsal space, a small record store concentrating on vinyl albums and 45s and even a darkroom: a full-service facility for bands to practice, record and release music as fast as possible.
 ''It's certainly not lucrative to open a record company now, between the recession and where the music business is,'' he said in an interview at the evening's end. ''But this is what I love to do, put music in people's hands.''
 In addition to label executive and shopkeeper Mr. White has assumed another new role. In his other bands he is known as one of rock's finest guitarists. But for the Dead Weather he will serve as the drummer (while sharing some vocal duties with Ms. Mosshart). Dean Fertita, from Queens of the Stone Age, is the guitarist, and Jack Lawrence, also of the Raconteurs, plays the bass.
 The 11 songs on the album -- 10 originals and a yowling cover of Bob Dylan's ''New Pony,'' mostly recorded over a few weeks in January -- are spare and sexy, with the vocals often distorted or submerged beneath grinding, snaky rhythms. (The first single, ''Hang You From the Heavens,'' is already available on iTunes; the full album is to be released in June, with a tour to follow.)
 Mr. White seemed energized by returning to an instrument he played in his youth. ''For years I've been playing guitar like a drummer,'' he said. ''Now I want to play drums like a producer and see what happens. Looking at a song from that seat is a whole different ballgame, and it makes me reinvest in writing and producing music again.''
 When the band took to the small space at the rear of the offices to play a five-song set, the garage-blues base of the songs became more prominent, the sound more physical. Before and after performing Mr. White and his band mates mingled with a crowd that ranged from fans who had been invited through White Stripes chat rooms to Nashville royalty like Martina McBride to the pop star (and local resident) Sheryl Crow. Other Raconteurs attended, as did Meg White, Mr. White's partner in the White Stripes. While the members of the Dead Weather carried themselves like true band mates -- whispering and giggling on a couch while the album played, getting boisterous and well lubricated after the show -- they insisted that all of their various other groups would remain intact.
 For Mr. White, starting a new band, label and base of operations are all connected. ''I want to show people that you can be part of this experience,'' he said. ''And that with a place like this, it can happen, and it will happen, all the time.''

HEADLINE: Another Increase in Initial Jobless Claims

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing initial claims for jobless benefits rose last week, while the total number of people continuing to receive benefits set a record high, the government said Thursday. 
 The Labor Department reported that first-time requests for unemployment insurance increased to 654,000 from the previous week's upwardly revised figure of 645,000, above analysts' expectations.
 The number of people receiving benefits for more than a week increased by 193,000, to 5.3 million, the most on record dating back to 1967. That is the sixth time in the last seven weeks that the jobless claims rolls have set a new record.
 As a proportion of the work force, the department said, the tally of Americans receiving unemployment benefits is the highest since June 1983, when the economy was recovering from a steep recession.
 Unemployment insurance rolls have risen sharply from a year ago, when only 2.8 million people were receiving benefits.
 Another 1.4 million people were receiving benefits under an extended unemployment compensation program approved by Congress last year. That tally was as of Feb. 21, the latest data available.
 The rise in continuing claims is an indication that many newly laid-off workers are having difficulty finding jobs.
 The labor market has been hammered as employers, squeezed by cutbacks in consumer and business spending, lay off workers at a rapid pace. Some economists say the unemployment rate could reach 10 percent by the end of this year.
 More job losses were announced this week. The computer maker Dell said Wednesday that it was laying off workers around the world but would not say where or how many. AMR's American Airlines unit said Wednesday it would lay off 323 flight attendants on April 1.
 The National Semiconductor Corporation, meanwhile, said it would lay off 1,725 employees, more than a quarter of its work force, after third-quarter profit fell 71 percent.
 The industrial conglomerate United Technologies, which makes Otis elevators and Sikorsky helicopters, said Tuesday that it would lay off 11,600 workers, or 5 percent of its work force.

An article on Tuesday about the role of physicists in finance misstated the affiliations of three economists at the time they figured out a way to price stock options. In 1973 when their groundbreaking papers were published, Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton were at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Fischer Black was at the University of Chicago. They were not, respectively, at Stanford, Harvard and Goldman Sachs. (Those were later affiliations.)

HEADLINE: Grading the Schools Chancellor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Debate on New York Schools Pivots on One Man at the Top'' (''Controlling Interests'' series, front page, March 6): 
 I worked in the schools of New York City for 30 years as a teacher and principal. As a consultant, I visited schools all over the country and met with teachers, principals and parents. I raised two children who attended New York City public schools. 
 From those experiences, perhaps the most important thing I've learned is this: In order to create positive change in schools, the major focus must be on teaching and learning -- what goes on in classrooms between teachers and students, every day and every minute of those days. 
 Good schools pay attention to what teachers are teaching and how they're teaching it, how they can refine and add to what they already know, how the curriculums are created and how they make for fruitful learning. 
 If Chancellor Joel I. Klein is really interested in ''changing longstanding practices,'' as the article notes, he might consider valuing the actual work that school people do every day, directly with children, work that does not appear in headlines. 
 Blossom Gelernter San Diego, March 7, 2009
 The writer is the founding principal of Public School 234 in New York City.
 To the Editor: 
 While it may be true that Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein is not a career educator, it is just as important to note who he is. 
 He is a visionary leader who has high expectations for all of our students. The policies and innovative programs that he has put into effect demonstrate his tireless efforts to continue to improve our schools. 
 He has done more than many career educators who served before him.
 David C. Banks New York, March 6, 2009
 The writer is founding principal of the Eagle Academy for Young Men and president of the Eagle Academy Foundation.
 To the Editor:
 Mayoral control was passed by the State Legislature in 2002 as an experiment in school system governance, with a sunset provision set to take effect in June. Framing the question as one of how Chancellor Joel I. Klein has ''wielded the unprecedented power'' bestowed upon him by the law doesn't take into account the very question implicit in the phrase. 
 ''Unprecedented power'' is hardly a technical matter. As a lawyer who has served several previous schools chancellors, I can assure you that before the new law, chancellors had extensive authority to set citywide policy and educational standards, enforce regulations and operate the school system. They did not hesitate to use that authority. 
 What the 2002 law did was eliminate checks and balances to the exercise of that power. For seven years, the school system has been run as a centralized top-down system without those safeguards. 
 Mr. Klein did not have to answer to the city board, which was rendered toothless by the law, nor did he have to respond to parents, who lost the machinery that allowed their concerns to be heard at the local level and appealed to central officials.
 The seven-year experiment is at an end. The State Legislature should act to bring those voices back into the system.
 Nancy M. Lederman New York, March 6, 2009
 To the Editor:
 In his quest for equity, Chancellor Joel I. Klein has ignored the pleas of parents like me and reduced our children's schools to drab environments dominated by test preparation. 
 I guess he's achieved his goal, though: all New York City students are now entitled to the same dull, substandard education.
 Martha Foote Brooklyn, March 7, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I am the founder and principal of the Bronx Lab School, a small new high school on the Evander Childs campus. 
 When I arrived here in 2004, I saw firsthand just how bad things were before Joel I. Klein became chancellor. The campus was not safe for students or staff. Only a quarter of the high school class of 2004 graduated.
 Mr. Klein invited me to do something about this, just as he asked other educators to start schools across the city. He believed in my ability, despite my age (30 at the time). He empowered me by entrusting me with key decision-making on budgeting and hiring. 
 Thanks to Mr. Klein, to a band of tireless, talented teachers and to students who are as hard-working as they are deserving, last June at Bronx Lab 95 percent of the class of 2008 graduated, with more than 350 college acceptances and $2.5 million in financial aid.
 The Bronx Lab classes of 2008 and 2009 -- a majority of whom will be the first in their families to attend college -- thank Mr. Klein for giving them a chance to succeed.
 Marc Sternberg Bronx, March 6, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I am struck by how much the issue of personality diverts attention from the urgency of developing and sustaining effective school reform. 
 For our children to succeed and for our city to prosper, students must graduate with the knowledge, skills and personal attributes needed for college, participation in the 21st-century economy and active citizenship. 
 Improving student achievement and raising the graduation rate are the foundations of meeting this challenge. Under Chancellor Joel I. Klein's leadership, these measures have risen. Graduation rates have stagnated in most other urban districts. 
 As the senior counselor to the chancellor for education policy from 2002 through early 2007, I spent hundreds of hours with Mr. Klein meeting with community and parent groups as he worked to create a system of good schools. I can attest to his commitment in fact as well as words.
 Michele Cahill New York, March 6, 2009
 The writer is vice president for national programs and program director, urban education, of the Carnegie Corporation of New York.
 To the Editor:
 Whatever your views on Chancellor Joel I. Klein and the changes taking root in the New York City school system, there seems to be a significant number of parents who feel disenfranchised from the schools.
 A full-functioning citywide board of education -- as envisioned by state law -- would go a long way toward increasing trust by giving parents and the public more opportunity for involvement in education decisions. 
 Honest, sincere community involvement is one of the foundations on which public education is built. When open communication and trust are reciprocal, problems can be explored and solved together.
 Timothy G. Kremer Latham, N.Y., March 11, 2009

HEADLINE: Europe's Way of Encouraging Solar Power Arrives in the U.S.

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH; James Kanter contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Solar cells adorn the roofs of many homes and warehouses across Germany, while the bright white blades of wind turbines are a frequent sight against the sky in Spain.
 If one day these machines become as common on the plains and rooftops of the United States as they are abroad, it may be because the financing technique that gave Europe an early lead in renewable energy is starting to cross the Atlantic.
 Put simply, the idea is to pay homeowners and businesses top dollar for producing green energy. In Germany, for example, a homeowner with a rooftop solar system may be paid four times more to produce electricity than the rate paid to a coal-fired power plant. 
 This month Gainesville, Fla., became the first city in the United States to introduce higher payments for solar power, which is otherwise too expensive for many families or businesses to install. City leaders, who control their electric utility, unanimously approved the policy after studying Germany's solar-power expansion.
 Hawaii, where sky-high prices for electricity have stirred interest in alternative forms of power like solar, hopes to have a similar policy in place before the end of the year. The mayor of Los Angeles wants to introduce higher payouts for solar power. California is considering a stronger policy as well, and bills have also been introduced in other states, including Washington and Oregon.
 ''I'm seeing it with my own eyes -- it's really having a good effect on our local economy, particularly in these hard times,'' said Edward J. Regan, the assistant general manager for strategic planning at Gainesville Regional Utilities in Florida. He said he had gotten calls from other cities and states since announcing the policy.
 The new payment method is referred to as a ''feed-in tariff'' in Europe. It is, in essence, a mandate by the government telling a utility to pay above-market rates for green electricity. 
 It shifts the burden of subsidizing green energy from taxpayers, as is common in the United States, to electricity ratepayers. And the technique includes assurances that a utility will pay the high rates for a long period, often 15 to 25 years.
 The surge of interest in the payment system is a recognition that despite generous state and federal incentives, the United States still lags far behind Europe in solar power. Germany, where feed-in tariffs have been in place since 1991, has about five times as many photovoltaic panels installed as the United States, though they still account for only 0.5 percent of electricity in that country.
 In the United States, said Wilson Rickerson, a Boston energy consultant, ''a lot of people simultaneously reached the conclusion -- who's moving fastest internationally? And that's definitely been Germany and Spain.''
 In Gainesville, the new policy has already sparked a rush to put up panels. John Stanton, a retired civil servant living there with his wife, put 24 solar panels on his roof in late January, as city leaders sped the policy toward approval. Gainesville's municipal utility will pay Mr. Stanton and other homeowners and businesses who generate solar power more than twice the standard electricity rate, guaranteeing that rate for 20 years.
 ''It was the thing that sort of put us over the top,'' said Mr. Stanton, who gained an appreciation of European energy policies after living in Italy for more than a decade.
 Mr. Regan said that homeowners with panels received a payment under the new policy that works out to more than a 25 percent premium over the city's other incentives, which include rebates and a more modest rate payment.
 Wind power and other sources of renewable energy are generally included in the European payment systems, but solar -- as one of the costliest renewables -- has benefited the most. Payment rates in Europe for wind are substantially lower than for solar, according to Christian Kjaer, chief executive of the European Wind Energy Association.
 In the United States, solar panels remain prohibitively expensive -- a big reason that the panels account for far less than 1 percent of electricity generation. Generating power from the sun using rooftop panels can cost four times as much as coal, the largest and cheapest source of electricity in this country.
 If a utility commits to paying a higher rate for renewable power over a period of years, it can offer those with solar panels or wind turbines a steady return that helps defray the initial cost of the equipment. ''If you put your money in, you know you're going to get it back,'' Mr. Rickerson said, referring to Germany.
 But requiring utilities to pay extra for green power has a direct impact on ratepayers. Homeowners' electricity bills will rise 74 cents a month in Gainesville, or about half a percentage point of the average homeowner's monthly bill.
 ''Seventy cents -- what's that? A Coke?'' said Mr. Regan, of the Gainesville utility.
 Opponents of feed-in tariffs like Marcel Hawiger, a staff attorney for the Utility Reform Network in California, say that the policy would hit poor people the hardest by raising their electricity rates because a relatively high percentage of their income goes to pay utility bills.
 ''Why should we use regressive taxation to support the most expensive form of renewable energy?'' Mr. Hawiger asked.
 The solar programs have sometimes proved so popular that costs can spiral out of control. Last fall, blockbuster growth forced Spain to cap the number of solar installations it would subsidize. Ontario, which has had a feed-in tariff since 2006, also suspended its program last year after being oversubscribed, but wants to restart the policy. 
 Even in Gainesville, homeowners wanting to put solar panels on their roof are now out of luck: a few days after introducing the policy, the city reached its cap on solar payments for this year and next. Meanwhile, a handful of utilities around the country are already doing similar things voluntarily, albeit on a tiny scale.
 For now, at least, solar-power advocates do not believe they have the votes in Congress to adopt a national feed-in tariff system like the ones in Germany and Spain. They are putting their hopes, instead, on proposals in Congress to mandate that a certain percentage of electricity comes from renewables.

HEADLINE: Competitive Student Loans

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Helping Students, Not Lenders'' (editorial, March 4):
 While you praise the proposal to eliminate the Federal Family Education Loan Program, you do not factor in the choice and valuable services offered to student borrowers that are a product of the competition between the Federal Family Education Loan Program and the government's direct loan program. The nationalization of student lending would eliminate those benefits and hurt the very students the proposal intends to help. 
 The claim that the direct loan program is ''less expensive'' is tenuous at best, as originating all loans through the direct loan program during the next five years would require roughly $500 billion in new Treasury borrowing. 
 In the end, we're confident that federal policy makers will closely scrutinize this proposal, as well as potential alternatives, before terminating a successful 40-year-old program with proven results in providing college access and opportunity for millions of students.
 Peter Warren President, Education Finance Council Washington, March 5, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Why do you not support free-market principles in student loans with the same tenacity that you support them in other areas? You endorse a proposal by the Obama administration to abolish guaranteed loans, thereby eliminating all consumer choice and competition in federal student loans. 
 In an editorial about the airline industry in 2007, you wrote that the government ''could have gone further and opened up the American market to more competition, and the superior service and lower prices that come with it.'' You also said, ''We hope that politicians will embrace the free-market principles they so frequently tout.'' 
 Your support of a government monopoly in student loans -- which could eventually have the Department of Education managing $1 trillion in loans -- is irreconcilable with your embrace of competition elsewhere. 
 Competition in student loans has created significant consumer benefits: free delinquency and default prevention services, increasingly important in this economy, as well as better terms, college access programs and consumer-friendly processes.

HEADLINE: Giants Hold Line on Ticket Prices

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
The Giants announced Thursday that they would not raise prices on season tickets this year. They are among 23 N.F.L. teams -- including the Jets -- to hold prices steady in the face of a deepening recession. 
 This is the first time since the 2000 season that the Giants have not increased the prices, which range from $80 a ticket for several sections in the upper deck to $105 for seats in the mezzanine. The gross average price for Giants tickets is $91.10, ranking 12th in the N.F.L. last season. 
 This is the last season that the Giants and the Jets will play in Giants Stadium. Season-ticket holders will have to pay for personal seat licenses to retain their tickets at the new stadium. 
 The Giants will host five 2008 playoff teams next season: the conference finalists Arizona and Philadelphia, and Atlanta, Carolina and San Diego. JUDY BATTISTA

HEADLINE: After Rampage, a Hush Returns, Filled With Pain

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER; Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Atlanta.

DATELINE: SAMSON, Ala. 

 BODY:
This town of 2,100 is a place long down on its luck, where the downtown is crumbling and half-empty, the textile jobs were shipped overseas years ago and a sign at a hardware store asks passers-by to ''make offer.'' Samson is so poor, several residents said, that the national recession is not even noticed. 
 This week, however, has been even worse. Nine of its own were gunned down in an incomprehensible massacre by a young man as quiet as the town. The hail of bullets broke the silence -- the gunman, Michael McLendon, raced through town with a rifle sticking out of the window of his car -- but on Thursday all was still again. 
 Grocery store clerks went to work biting their lips. Mothers watched anxiously over small children -- one of those killed Tuesday was a baby girl. Pedestrians, in the twilight, got wary stares from people on their porches. 
 Outwardly, not much was different in this southern Alabama town. A few black ribbons were on the door of the Brooks Peanut Company, which lost an employee, Bruce W. Malloy, in the shooting. The flag outside the Methodist church was at half-staff, bouquets were scattered downtown, the lunchtime crowd at Crews BBQ was subdued. 
 Inside, though, people were hurting. ''A lot of them are still grieving,'' said Bill Warren, the owner of an IGA grocery store. ''The demeanor, the countenance and everything, you can tell it's just real different today.'' 
 Mr. Warren's son Wayne, who works at the store, said the town remained in shock. ''Everybody looks empty,'' he said. ''They're just distraught. Most of them are just quiet. They can't believe what's going on.''
 Amanda Smith, who works at a downtown pet-care store near the site of one of the shootings, said she had not slept in two nights. ''He had just shot the lady at the store,'' Ms. Smith said, looking down. ''I saw the lady lying there.'' 
 Her mother, Barbara Mock, who also works at the store, said: ''It's just something I can't get out of my mind. We heard all them shots. I don't know if we'll ever get over it.'' 
 A few pieces of information were released Thursday that shed some light on the gunman's state of mind. Investigators said they found a letter that Mr. McLendon had dropped in a mailbox in which he described harsh feelings toward family members. Among the 10 people Mr. McLendon killed in all were his mother, an uncle and an aunt.
 Barry Tucker of the Alabama Bureau of Investigation said a confidant of Mr. McLendon told officials that the gunman was disappointed he had failed in his efforts to fulfill his dream of being either a Marine or a police officer.
 But the larger questions went unanswered for the victims' relatives, several of whom spent part of a radiant spring day sitting outside on the town's plain streets, dotted with low-slung brick houses.
 ''It's just unbelievable. I haven't processed it yet,'' said Chelsea Lee, 19, the daughter of Sonya Smith, who was gunned down at the Big Little convenience store on Main Street. 
 Ms. Lee spoke quietly but without tears. ''We're coping the best way we can,'' she said while sitting next to her aunt Kathy Lolley.
 Ms. Smith and Ms. Lolley worked together at the metals processing plant in nearby Geneva where Mr. McLendon had once worked and where he fatally shot himself. They had both called in sick Tuesday. 
 Many here must leave town to work. But not to worship: there are a dozen or so churches, and the town's devotion is helping see it through. ''We're just putting our faith in the Lord,'' Ms. Lolley said. A prayer service was held Wednesday night at First Baptist Church, and more are planned. 
 ''It's our faith in God that keeps us stable,'' said Judy Merritt, a beauty salon owner who is a minister at the Methodist church. 
 Ms. Merritt took care of the 3-year-old son of Josh Myers, a sheriff's deputy, after his wife, Andrea, was fatally shot. ''When's Mommy coming home?'' Ms. Merritt said the little boy asked. 
 ''There is no explanation; there is no reason,'' Ms. Merritt said. 
 The gun culture here was not an explanation offered Thursday. Mr. McLendon had armed himself with four guns for his rampage and was a weapons aficionado. But most of the men interviewed here said they too possessed multiple firearms, and several said they recognized the caliber of those fired in the massacre. 
 ''Since the economy's gotten bad, people are afraid to get rid of their guns,'' Wayne Warren said. ''People are storing ammo.''

HEADLINE: Sweden Aids Bailout of Baltic Nations

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: STOCKHOLM 

 BODY:
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are too big to fail, at least for Sweden.
 In the last decade, Sweden's banks plowed billions of kronor into their tiny but booming neighbors across the Baltic Sea. Now severe recessions are turning the Baltic states into the Swedish equivalent of what subprime mortgages were to American banks.
 The crisis also echoes the one banks in Sweden faced in the early 1990s, when bold choices early in mounting a bailout paid off handsomely. That history gives bankers here confidence they can pull off the feat again, this time with the failing finances of entire countries. 
 ''There is a strong feeling from our side that we have a political responsibility to do whatever we can to help them,'' Anders Borg, the Swedish finance minister, said in an interview. ''They are new democracies; they are part of our economic region.''
 In its deep sense of ownership of the Baltics, Sweden's own financial self-interest and a broader desire in Europe to avoid a new East-West divide are driving Sweden to spend more money.
 Whether it will work to save the Baltics -- and whether Swedish citizens will approve -- remains to be seen. 
 ''I don't think we've seen the real test yet, which is when you put a large amount of Swedish taxpayer money into the Baltics,'' said Torbjoern Becker, the director of the Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics.
 Sweden's Baltic commitments, he said, risk a heated debate similar to the one that took place in the United States when it granted Mexico a $20 billion loan in 1995 during that country's currency crisis. 
 Swedish banks have issued loans equivalent to roughly 20 percent of Sweden's gross domestic product to the Baltic countries, an amount that only a few years ago looked like a wise bet.
 Now, according to Danske Bank, the loans could cost Sweden a total of 2 percent to 6 percent of its G.D.P. over several years, depending on how many Baltic borrowers default during the recessions ravaging the region. 
 This year, economies in all three Baltic states could contract 6 percent to 10 percent, exacerbating pain for Swedish banks and driving them further into the arms of their own government.
 Bo Lundgren, head of the Swedish national debt office, said the course of the Baltics would be crucial to the stability of the Swedish financial system. But as a grizzled veteran of Sweden's own crisis in the early 1990s, he said the country could handle the shock. ''You cannot rule out need for further capital injections,'' Mr. Lundgren said. ''If state support is needed we are well prepared.''
 The strong Scandinavian presence is fairly uncontroversial in the Baltics. The Russian occupation of the three countries for much of the 20th century makes Swedes seem rather benign.
 ''You can find differences if you want -- Swedes are Swedes and Estonians are Estonians,'' said Juhan Parts, Estonia's economy minister. ''But there are no worries here about losing independence or economic power.''
 Still, Swedish banks contributed to the Baltic crisis by feeding a debt-fueled boom in real estate and construction. The free-spending led to big current account deficits in all three countries, and hence an addiction to foreign capital.
 With the real estate bubble now deflating, Swedish banks are left with unpaid mortgages and sour consumer loans. Swedbank, the Swedish bank most exposed in the Baltics, has seen its loan-loss rate quadruple in the last year.
 Sweden's first line of defense has been to embrace the Baltics through its own banks. The government passed its own rescue package, which included 1.5 trillion kronor ($173 billion), in the autumn to guarantee new issues of Swedish bank debt, a portion of which was to be used to recapitalize banks that had heavy losses.
 ''We have declared to our banks that they are supposed to behave responsibly -- to perceive these Baltic countries as their home market,'' Mr. Borg said.
 But recapitalizing Swedish banks to keep credit flowing in other countries is no easy feat.
 Mikael Inglander, Swedbank's chief financial officer of Swedbank, which gets 17 percent of its revenue from the Baltics, said ''shareholders would probably not appreciate it if we use their money to rescue countries.'' And he noted that lending, in any recession, generally declines. ''We try to act responsibly,'' Mr. Inglander said. ''But it is not possible for any player to make the market perform in a certain way.''
 Swedbank has already tapped the Swedish government program for guarantees, and has raised new capital through private offerings. 
 The government is also helping to recapitalize Nordea Bank; it has been a shareholder since the bank was nationalized in Sweden's crisis a decade ago.
 Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, better known as S.E.B., the big Swedish bank that is controlled by the Wallenbergs, the first family of Swedish business, has avoided going to the government.
 Sweden also has been kicking in ever-larger sums to international efforts to help the Baltic countries meet their obligations, not the least to Swedish banks.
 It is contributing more than 1 billion euros, or $1.28 billion, of the 7.5-billion-euro rescue package for Latvia that was put together in December with the International Monetary Fund and others. 
 And two weeks ago, it agreed to trade the equivalent of $1.1 billion in Estonian kroons for Swedish kronor, swapping its own currency for one under immense pressure.
 But one way or another, Lars Christensen, a senior analyst at Danske Bank said, Sweden and its banks would pay for the Baltic binge of the past.
 ''It's like drinking a bottle of vodka and saying, 'Gee, how do I avoid a hangover?''' Mr. Christensen said. ''You can't.''

HEADLINE: Snow and Tight Economy Aid Eastern Ski Resorts

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: LINCOLN, N.H. 

 BODY:
The economy may be in the doldrums, but New England ski resorts are having a great year, buoyed by plenty of snow and proximity to major metropolitan areas.
 ''With the financial crunch, I think we're actually benefiting in that people aren't going on longer vacations or getting on an airplane,'' said Karl Stone, a spokesman for Ski New Hampshire, which represents the state's ski areas. ''Because the snow has been so good, people are saying, 'Why should I fly out West when we just got 17 inches of snow in New Hampshire.' '' 
 Most ski areas in the East are reporting near-record skier visits and hotel bookings well above average. But in the West, many resorts are reporting a drop in visitors. 
 Snowfall in the Northeast was above average this year, including a large storm in early March, conditions that historically drive up skier traffic. 
 Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas Association, and Eastern ski-area operators say that New England ski country's proximity to major metropolitan areas -- two hours by car from Boston, four hours from New York and six hours from Philadelphia -- coupled with ski and stay deals, have also made skiing an attractive, less expensive winter getaway. 
 ''What's been most surprising is how strong the season has been,'' said Patrick Corso, president of the Mount Washington resort in Bretton Woods, N.H.
 During the third week in February the resort was up 14 percent in skier visits and 9 percent in revenue over last year, which set records thanks to ample snow. 
 At Cannon Mountain in Franconia, N.H., sales of season passes were up 100 percent before the ski season started -- and while gas prices were still high. The resort is enticing budget-conscious skiers with a deal offering two lift tickets for the price of one that is valid Tuesdays and Thursdays. 
 At Sugarbush in Warren, Vt., revenue is up 15 percent this year, a ''shocking'' figure, said J. J. Toland, a resort spokesman. Sales of season passes are up 11 percent, and traffic to the resort's Web site jumped 28 percent during a week in which the mountain received two feet of snow. 
 ''For some,'' Mr. Toland said, skiing and snowboarding ''are a passion, versus an amenity or an indulgency.'' 
 ''People will go out one night less, or they won't go out to dinner or they won't go to the movies so they can go skiing for a day,'' he said. ''I think people are tightening their belt in that regard.'' 
 Skiers staying closer to home is having an adverse affect on some resorts in the West.
 In Colorado, Vail Resorts reported this week that skier visits were down 5.1 percent for the year, and lodging occupancy dropped by 13.9 percent. 
 Rob Katz, the chief executive of Vail Resorts, is forgoing a salary next year and will take a 15 percent pay cut the following year. 
 Skier visits are down about 7.5 percent at Colorado resorts, said Ari Stiller-Shulman, a spokesman for Colorado Ski Country USA, which represents 22 of the state's resorts. 
 Not all Eastern resorts are without a few trouble spots. Here at Loon Mountain, even though the lift lines were jammed on a recent Saturday, overall skier visits are down, but a strong February vacation week helped save the season. 
 Mr. Corso said he expected to end the season on a positive note, as the resort received new snow in the first week in March. 
 ''I don't think any of us predicted this,'' he said. ''The season isn't over, but, boy, has it been a surprise.''

HEADLINE: A Hybrid's Niche? The Masses, It Hopes

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE souring economy has shifted the advertising spotlight from higher-end, premium-priced products to less flashy, mass-market offerings that do not require buyers to cash in their 201(k)'s, as in the retirement accounts formerly known as 401(k)'s.
 That is particularly true in the automotive category, in which brands known for sensible pricing -- Hyundai, Kia, Subaru -- have recently been outperforming more expensive competitors. So the timing may be right for a hybrid car with a suggested retail price starting under $20,000 -- the first in the American market in that price range.
 That new model also comes as car sales decline along with gasoline prices, which may diminish consumer interest in greener transportation. 
 The American Honda Motor Company is taking a big risk on the potential appeal of a more mainstream hybrid. The automaker plans to introduce the 2010 Honda Insight on March 24, with sticker prices of $19,800 to $23,100 (plus destination charges).
 By comparison, the 2010 Ford Fusion hybrid, from the Ford Motor Company, is priced from $27,270, and the 2009 Toyota Prius, from Toyota Motor Sales USA, starts at $22,000. The largest hybrids, like the 2009 GMC Yukon from General Motors, can cost $50,000 or more.
 A campaign for the Insight, with a budget estimated at $50 million to $75 million, is scheduled to start on Monday. The campaign is by RPA in Santa Monica, Calif. The ads present the Insight as a democratic car -- small ''d,'' that is, as opposed to, say, President Obama's souped-up Cadillac limousine -- because it is priced to be affordable.
 ''You know who could use a car like this?'' asks the headline of a print advertisement. ''Everyone.''
 The headline of another print ad expresses that idea more succinctly. ''For the many,'' it says.
 An announcer in a commercial declares, ''The hybrid for everyone is here,'' and concludes: ''The Insight. Designed and priced for us all. From Honda.''
 Most ads end with these words: ''From Honda. For everyone.''
 The Insight is, as the campaign styles it, the people's hybrid. Too bad there is already an automotive brand known as the people's car (or Volkswagen, in German).
 The campaign is, appropriately, broad-based, running on television and radio; in magazines and newspapers; on the Internet; and in movie theaters.
 In a truly populist touch, there will be Insight ads on banners towed by planes over beaches on the Memorial Day and the Fourth of July weekends.
 ''It's more of a car for the masses,'' said Tom Peyton, senior manager for national advertising at American Honda Motor in Torrance, Calif., part of the Honda Motor Company of Japan.
 ''You don't have to be special'' to buy it, he added, or ''particularly well-off.'' And one Internet banner ad describes the car as ''mass appeal transportation,'' and another calls it ''anti-niche.''
 ''In some research we've done, people said, 'Conspicuous consumption for my automobile is not where I'm at right now,' '' Mr. Peyton said, ''and they're starting to look at cars that are sensible, that are values.''
 This is not the first time at the hybrid rodeo for American Honda Motor. A decade ago, the company introduced a two-door hatchback Insight, which became an also-ran to the bigger, more popular Prius from Toyota.
 The first Insight was ''more of a science project,'' said Steven Center, vice president for advertising and public relations at American Honda Motor. ''This one's a real car.''
 ''We're positioning it to be either your first hybrid or your first new car, or both,'' he added.
 The new Insight, with four doors rather than two, arrives as demand for cars -- hybrid or otherwise -- is falling to the levels of the early 1980s. American Honda Motor is not immune; its sales last month dropped 38 percent compared to February 2008.
 ''It's not enough to say 'It gets good gas mileage' or 'It's a hybrid,' '' Mr. Peyton said. ''Value and lower monthly payments are what's working in this market.''
 ''Even in a down economy,'' he added, ''there are people who want to buy green, if it's affordable.''
 That consideration is played up in the campaign. For instance, when the prices for the Insight were announced on Tuesday, the headline of a new post on the Insight Web site's blog (insight.honda.com) read, ''The Insight is the Most Affordable U.S. Hybrid.''
 In a print ad, a list of features on the Insight ends this way: ''and, most importantly, an affordable price tag.''
 The subtext is that hybrids are no longer the purview of the affluent and the environmental benefits would increase if more hybrids were on the road.
 ''It's affordable so more people can drive it, so the impact of hybrids can truly be felt,'' said Joe Baratelli, senior vice president and creative director at RPA.
 At the same time, there is no intent to apply ''any guilt or pressure'' to potential buyers, he added, or to seem ''preachy,'' because that would only be counterproductive.
 During the initial planning for the campaign last year, the focus was more on how a hybrid would combat the high price of gasoline, Mr. Baratelli said.
 ''But we had the discussions about what if the price went back down,'' he added, ''so we realized we needed a bigger, broader message, a more philosophical message, that this technology is now available for everybody.''
 Commercials will appear on television shows like ''Grey's Anatomy'' and ''House''; on TV-centric Web sites like abc.com, cbs.com, hulu.com and nbc.com; and in movie theaters. There will also be video ads on aol.com, msn.com and yahoo.com as well as a presence for Insight on Facebook, MySpace and YouTube.
 The radio element of the campaign will include local promotions tied to Earth Day, April 22, involving disc jockeys and Web sites of CBS stations.
 There will also be promotions for Earth Day with NBC, which will run vignettes featuring actors from its shows driving Insights. The promotion is part of the ''Green Is Universal'' campaign on NBC, part of the NBC Universal unit of General Electric.

HEADLINE: Household Wealth Falls By Trillions

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
In the last few months, most Americans have felt poorer. Now they have the numbers to prove it.
 The Federal Reserve reported Thursday that households lost $5.1 trillion, or 9 percent, of their wealth in the last three months of 2008, the most ever in a single quarter in the 57-year history of recordkeeping by the central bank. 
 For the full year, household wealth dropped $11.1 trillion, or about 18 percent. Though the numbers do not yet reflect it, the decline in the stock market so far this year has probably erased trillions more in the country's collective net worth. 
 The next biggest annual decline in wealth came in 2002, when household net worth fell 3 percent after the collapse of the technology bubble. The most recent loss of wealth is staggering and will probably put further pressure on the economy because many people will have to spend less and save more. 
 Most of the wealth was lost in financial assets like stocks, which tumbled at the end of last year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, for instance, fell 23 percent in the fourth quarter. The value of residential real estate, the biggest asset for most families, fell much less -- $870 billion, or about 4 percent. 
 Even the richest among us have become a lot poorer. This week, Forbes magazine published its list of the richest people in the world. At No. 1, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, still had $40 billion to his name, but that was down $18 billion. The wealth of Warren E. Buffett, the investor whose company Berkshire Hathaway had a rare bad year, tumbled $25 billion, to $37 billion.
 The loss of wealth is concentrated among the most affluent Americans, in large part because they own more stocks and bonds than the rest of the country. Only about 50 percent of households own stock, and many of them own relatively small sums in retirement accounts.
 As a result of their greater wealth and higher incomes, the affluent tend to spend a lot more than their share of the population would imply. The top 20 percent of income earners spend more than the bottom 60 percent of income earners, according to calculations by Tobias Levkovich, the chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup.
 ''When their wealth is mauled, they are not particularly interested in spending,'' Mr. Levkovich said.
 The Fed report released on Thursday also showed that total borrowing and lending increased at an annual rate of 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter, mostly as a result of increased borrowing by the federal government to finance its operations and various bailouts of the financial system. The government's borrowing increased at an annual rate of 37 percent.
 But borrowing by households dropped 2 percent. Lending to businesses was up 1.7 percent. Recent surveys of loan officers by the Fed have shown that companies have been drawing down lines of credit that were established in the past, and that only a small fraction of the lending to the private sector is through new loans, which are much harder to obtain than in recent years.

HEADLINE: A Portrait of Rhode Island, as the Governor Paints It

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Smallest State Grapples With Oversize Problems'' (news article, March 1): 
 New Yorkers who vacation in Rhode Island or who have second homes in our state may have found themselves, as I did, wanting a more complete picture of Rhode Island than was presented in the article. 
 Since I took office, we've reformed welfare, streamlined state government, invested in our infrastructure, created 20,000 new jobs, protected thousands of acres of open space, and are the first state in the nation to begin development of a huge offshore renewable energy project. 
 Our overall tax burden has been reduced. We've reined in property taxes, and I've proposed changes in corporate and personal income taxes that will encourage wealth producers and businesses to make Rhode Island their home. 
 We're moving faster than most states to put federal stimulus dollars to work. We were one of the first states in the nation to apply the $25 increase in the unemployment insurance benefits and among the first states to certify infrastructure projects that will get Rhode Islanders back to work. We are well poised for the recovery.
 Perhaps as we step into better days, the positive results made possible by the hard decisions and sacrifices made today will be news in the pages of this newspaper tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Decline in Retail Sales Is Gentler Than Expected, but No Cause for Optimism

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Sales at the nation's retailers fell slightly less than expected in February, suggesting that the economic deceleration may at least be slowing, according to a government report on Thursday.
 The Commerce Department said retail sales declined 0.1 percent from January, better than the 0.5 percent drop that economists had expected, but nonetheless returning to negative territory after a surprise 1.8 percent gain in January. 
 Not including automobiles, which dragged down the overall number, sales ticked up 0.7 percent after a 1.6 percent gain in January. 
 Retailing analysts and economists said that sales in February were helped by a decline in gasoline prices that provided consumers with more disposable income. Sales at discount chains were up, but so were sales at furniture stores, which is surprising given the miserable state of the housing market. 
 ''What this tells us is the consumer is not dead,'' said Paul Laudicina, chairman of A. T. Kearney, the management consulting company. ''They are able to pick through and make purchases when necessary. And they are prepared to come out of the foxhole when the conditions permit them to.'' 
 Still, economists cautioned against breathing any sighs of relief. 
 ''Certainly the numbers are better than we expected, but I don't want to extrapolate this out just yet,'' said Rosalind Wells, chief economist for the National Retail Federation. ''We're a little cautious that this won't last. And we still have a rough economy facing us.''
 Mr. Laudicina said consumers needed income growth, access to financing and stronger stock and housing values to truly begin spending again.
 ''Until we see those three indicators fundamentally going positive, I don't think you're going to see anything but incremental change in these numbers.''
 Retailers have suffered sales declines in seven of the last eight months.
 Rising unemployment, slumping stock portfolios and a depressed housing market are obviously not inspiring the American consumer to spend. Last month, every category of retailer suffered sales declines except for discount stores, and household retailing names like Circuit City and Mervyn's have gone bankrupt. 
 Indeed, looking at the government figures year over year, retail and food services sales for February, seasonally adjusted, were down 8.6 percent.
 Gasoline station sales were down 32.3 percent, and motor vehicle and parts sales were down 23.5 percent from last year. 
 In a report about consumer behavior published Thursday, C. Britt Beemer, chief executive of America's Research Group, said ''the dramatic drops in shopping levels have no match in our database in the last 30 years.''
 In another economic report, the Commerce Department said that business reduced their inventories for a fifth consecutive month in January. Businesses cut inventories by 1.1 percent in January.
 Separately, the government said that the number of Americans filing initial claims for jobless benefits rose last week, while the total number of people continuing to receive benefits set a record.
 The Labor Department reported that first-time requests for unemployment insurance increased to 654,000 from the previous week's upwardly revised figure of 645,000, above analysts' expectations.
 The number of people receiving benefits for more than a week increased by 193,000, to 5.3 million, the most on record dating back to 1967 and the sixth time in seven weeks that the jobless claims rolls have set a record.
 Stocks surged on Thursday and interest rates declined.
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 14/32, to 99 3/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.85 percent, down from 2.90 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Net Worth of Families Declines Sharply

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The net worth of American households fell by the most in more than a half-century of record keeping during the fourth quarter of last year. 
 The Federal Reserve said Thursday that household net worth dropped by a record 9 percent from the level in the third quarter.
 The decline was the sixth consecutive quarterly drop in net worth and underscored the battering that families are undergoing in the midst of a steep recession, with unemployment surging and the value of their homes and investments plunging.
 Net worth represents total assets, like homes and checking accounts, minus liabilities like mortgages and credit card debt.
 Family net worth had hit a record high of $64.36 trillion in the April-June quarter of 2007 but has fallen in every quarter since then.
 The record 9 percent drop in the fourth quarter pushed total net worth down to $51.48 trillion.
 After five years of sharp increases in home prices, the housing bubble burst in 2007, sending shock waves through the financial system as banks were hit with billions of dollars of losses on mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.
 The federal government created a $700 billion rescue fund for the financial system last October but so far that effort has shown only modest results in terms of persuading banks to resume more normal lending patterns.
 Households have also been battered by the recession that began in December 2007 and is already the longest in a quarter-century. That downturn has sent unemployment soaring to a 25-year high of 8.1 percent in February, with 4.4 million jobs lost since the downturn began.
 The Federal Reserve began keeping quarterly records on net worth in 1951.

HEADLINE: Upended by Downsizing

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
A genius of dread, known for his unnerving horror films and eerie thrillers, the wildly prolific Japanese director Kiyoshi Kurosawa tends to ply his trade with spooky silences, a lived-in feel for everyday, droning life and a sense of social unease. Though his latest to hit the American big screen, ''Tokyo Sonata,'' looks like a family melodrama -- if a distinctly eccentric variant on the typical domestic affair -- there is more than a touch of horror to its story of a salaryman whose downsizing sets off a series of cataclysmic events. 
 In many respects, the family members here don't look much different from the characters who populate Mr. Kurosawa's other movies, some of whom are inexplicably driven to kill. Inexplicably or perhaps just unexplained: Unlike most genre directors in Hollywood and other commercial provenances, Mr. Kurosawa spends little time illuminating the mysteries of life, death and murder, the great whys that preoccupy filmmakers and invariably reduce being to behaviorism or DNA. It isn't that interpretation has no place in his work. It's entirely possible, for instance, to see the multitudes of drifting jellyfish in his 2003 movie ''Bright Future'' as a symbol for Japanese youth gripped by anomie. Yet while that interpretation has its satisfactions, it doesn't really explain why one character massacres an entire family. 
 The bloodletting is more metaphoric in his new movie, which, soon after the opening credits, cuts to a Tokyo office where corporate drones are briskly marching through the corridors. Minutes later, Ryuhei (Teruyuki Kagawa), an administrative middle manager, has packed his belongings in a paper shopping bag and headed out, having been rendered redundant. (One Chinese employee, a drone says, can do the work of two Japanese staffers.) Instead of telling his wife, Megumi (Kyoko Koizumi), however, Ryuhei continues to leave the house every morning, wearing a suit and tie and carrying his briefcase, props in an elaborate, increasingly desperate pantomime that takes him from standing in the unemployment lines to scrubbing public toilets on his hands and knees. 
 As Ryuhei tries to keep up appearances, his family's facade crumbles. The oldest son, Takashi (Yu Koyanagi), seeks to enlist in the American military, which, to support its expanding war in the Middle East, has begun to accept foreign recruits. (However satiric Mr. Kurosawa's intent, this idea didn't sound all that far-fetched when I first saw the movie last September.) The youngest son, Kenji (Kai Inowaki), meanwhile, begins using his lunch money to pay for piano lessons given by a melancholic beauty, Kaneko (Haruka Igawa). Lying on the sofa one night, Megumi poignantly asks Ryuhei to pull her up, but he's already left the room. Raising her arms, she entreats ''Somebody, please lift me up,'' but we're the only ones listening.
 Though no one does help her, Megumi ends up on a wild ride with a near-crazed would-be thief played by the great Koji Yakusho, the star of a handful of Mr. Kurosawa's best films, including ''Cure.'' (Non-Japanese audiences might best remember him from the wistful romance ''Shall We Dance?'') By the time she heads off, the family has scattered like leaves, blown down such divergent paths that there are moments when it feels as if each were inhabiting an entirely different movie. Yet as the family disperses, Mr. Kurosawa ceaselessly brings them together through the editing. Long before the movie's unexpectedly moving finale, which pivots on an ethereal rendition of Debussy's ''Clair de Lune,'' he keeps the discordant layers of his composition in harmonious play. 
 As it ticks through the familiar ills brought about by a country outsourcing and downsizing itself into crisis, ''Tokyo Sonata'' takes on increasingly uncanny and timely resonance for an American audience. Mr. Kurosawa's social critiques rarely reverberate as loudly as this one: Ryuhei and Megumi even argue about his patriarchal authority, a fight that begins on a note of pathos but soon turns scarily violent: Having been victimized by his employer and, by extension, the country that creates the conditions for these harsh economic realities, the paterfamilias becomes a victimizer. But this being a Kiyoshi Kurosawa movie, nothing else happens the way you expect, particularly given the lessons you glean from other movies, including the similarly themed, more despairing 2001 French film ''Time Out.''
 Despite the catastrophes visited on the family and a few other characters, and in spite of its deep well of melancholia, ''Tokyo Sonata'' ends on a strangely, almost insistently optimistic note. Much of that optimism emanates from the youngest son, whose desire to play the piano becomes a form of generational resistance against his father, who, without explanation, insists he do no such thing. Domination, like family life, has become a hollow ritual here. (''I'm home,'' everyone says on returning to the house, as the mother answers, ''Welcome home.'') An economic crisis shakes the family up -- it brings the father to his knees, lifts the mother, almost destroys one son and liberates the other -- but it's art, useless art, that unites them.
 ''Tokyo Sonata'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Family dysfunction, two off-screen deaths and one bloody hit-and-run.

HEADLINE: American Apparel Said to Sell Stake to Private Equity Firm

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
American Apparel, the clothing retailer, is near a deal to sell a 20 percent stake in the company to Lion Capital, a private equity firm that once owned Jimmy Choo, for about $80 million, people involved in the deal said on Thursday. 
 The deal is expected to be announced Friday. American Apparel is on the verge of defaulting on $16 million of debt owed to the technology mogul Michael S. Dell that comes due a week from Friday.
 The deal should breathe new life into American Apparel and help stabilize its business in the economic downturn. The company announced last month that sales at its stores fell 9 percent, the first monthly drop in the company's history. Shares of American Apparel have fallen from a high of $10.86 a share this year to $1.49 a share on Thursday because of anxiety about its ability to pay its debts.
 American Apparel will use the proceeds of the sale to meet the payment due to Mr. Dell on Friday as well as $35 million of additional debt owed to him, these people said. Under the terms of the deal, Lions Capital, based in London, will receive warrants for 16 million new shares with a strike price of $2 a share, these people said. Lion Capital, which focuses on consumer investments, owns Orangina Schweppes, the soft drink maker; Kettle Foods, the potato chip maker; and Wagamama, a chain of trendy noodle restaurants in London.
 The deal for American Apparel is the latest twist in the short history of a company whose socially conscious manufacturing, sexually charged advertising and snug-fitting T-shirts have generated a devoted following.
 Founded in 1997 in Los Angeles by Dov Charney, an eccentric manager who personally photographed many of the semi-nude women in American Apparel advertising, the company quickly became a retail sensation. It now operates more than 260 retail stores in 19 countries and has more than 10,000 employees.
 As the company grew, it took a controversial step in late 2006 to become a public company by agreeing to sell itself to a public shell company called the Endeavor Acquisition Corporation, known as a ''black check'' firm. 
 The sale, for $382.5 million, raised the profile of the company and enriched Mr. Charney. 
 But it also exposed the company to critics who said its management and accounting processes were still those of a smaller company. 
 American Apparel has since added a series of seasoned executives to its management including Glenn A. Weinman, a veteran lawyer, as its general counsel just over a month ago.

HEADLINE: Nudging a Sleeping Giant Awake

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
GORE Mountain in New York State is one of the biggest ski areas in the Northeast, but it is also one of the least known.
 You won't find Gore in magazine rankings of top Eastern resorts, even when that list goes 20 deep. It isn't tinged with romantic New England imagery like the mountains of Vermont or respected for snowfall and terrain like the best in New Hampshire or Maine.
 It isn't seen as one of the weekend commuter stops, like Hunter, Windham or Belleayre in the Catskills, or Jiminy Peak in western Massachusetts. And it isn't draped in Olympic glory like Whiteface near Lake Placid, N.Y.
 Gore, operated by the state-owned Olympic Regional Development Authority, literally sits somewhere in between. It's west of Lake George, and often overlooked by the thousands of cars heavy with skis and snowboards that zoom past on Interstate 87. 
 What the passengers in those vehicles on their way to somewhere else don't see is Gore's 2,300 feet of vertical drop, a number that might soon grow to 2,500 feet. That would give Gore the sixth-highest vertical drop in the East. 
 Gore has 90 trails, about twice as many as some of its nearest competitors. And it is about a four-hour drive from Manhattan, roughly 30 minutes less than the drive to the popular south-central Vermont resorts.
 Gore has great terrain, especially glades, with 12 lifts that spread the crowds out. Situated in the state-owned Adirondack Park Preserve, Gore is peaceful and historic; it is celebrating its 45th anniversary this year.
 So what has kept Gore from a place of more prominence? The answer is simple: lodging, or at least the perception that there isn't any nearby. But that may be about to change, which means that Gore could be the sleeping giant of the Eastern ski industry.
 From the time Gore opened in 1964, the dream has been to connect its large network of trails with the adjacent and smaller North Creek Ski Bowl. North Creek opened in 1934, and used to be a destination of packed ski trains steaming up from Manhattan.
 But the ski bowl, about a quarter-mile from the village of North Creek, closed for a period and its trails began to fill with undergrowth. Gore reclaimed the ski bowl and reopened its handful of trails and a tubing park in 2003.
 That was the first step in the long-anticipated Gore-North Creek interconnection. This summer, state officials plan to install a new lift at North Creek that will give skiers and riders there access to Gore's 90 trails -- with the ability to ski or ride back to North Creek, too.
 Why is that important? Can you say the magic words of modern resort prosperity: ''ski in/ski out lodging''? People have been asking about ski in/ski out lodging at Gore for decades, and the answer has always been that there isn't any.
 ''The fact is there have always been a lot of lodges, hotels and B & Bs located near the mountain,'' said Gore's general manager, Mike Pratt. ''But the interconnect bridges the gap between the mountain and village. It brings us back to our roots and all the North Creek heritage.''
 North Creek is a tiny village but it has accommodations, restaurants, stores and a few other services. In addition, a group of local business executives, anticipating the interconnection with Gore, have moved to expand and renovate several properties. 
 A condominium and real estate development next to the North Creek trails is planned, which would be direct ski in/ski out lodging. Four other major North Creek projects are in the works that would bring more apartments, condos and detached houses. 
 A 31-room Main Street hotel that was closed for more than a year, the Copperfield Inn, reopened last month with glittering and upscale furnishings. Another Main Street motel, the Alpine Lodge, has been rebuilt and includes modern amenities like televisions with DVD players and Wi-Fi, and some rooms with gas fireplaces and/or Jacuzzis.
 ''We will know we've arrived when I see someone walking with skis over their shoulder, heading back to the hotel from the interconnect,'' said Dick Carlson, the Copperfield Inn's marketing director. ''We will still shuttle people the short distance to Gore. But I think people like the idea of access and alternatives.''
 Jill Broderick, who owns Broderick Real Estate in North Creek, said, ''The prospects of having a ski area next to a village where you can shop and eat without taking your ski boots off is enticing to a wider market.'' 
 She said that second homes in the area ranged from $150,000 for a ski cabin to $1.5 million for a large home.
 And recreation in the underpopulated Adirondacks includes more than downhill skiing. There are vast cross-country and backcountry skiing networks to explore, and in the spring and summer the region is a haven for hikers and those who like to fish or go white-water rafting.
 Not everyone believes in North Creek's promise as a bustling tourist or second-home attraction, though. A large outdoor sports retail outlet, Mountain and Boardertown, that had been something of a North Creek anchor recently closed. 
 Then again, there are values on the less-traveled paths. Rooms at the Copperfield Inn start at $169 a night in winter. At the Alpine Lodge, double rooms that can sleep four were offered for $129 earlier this winter.
 Across the street from the closed sporting-goods store, a new restaurant, barVino, has opened. BarVino occupies a former grocery store, and its owner, Michael Bowers, became the third person on the building's deed since it was built in 1920. The restaurant serves 32 wines by the glass (100 wines altogether), as well as 61 different beers.
 The clientele at barVino during a visit earlier this winter was a mix of Gore Mountain employees and second-home owners. 
 ''We're one of 15 new businesses to open in the area,'' said Mr. Bowers, a builder from Delaware who came to the region to build a house for a client and decided to stay. ''The mountain is expanding, and a small, charming village is being tweaked just a bit. We might be crazy dreamers, but I think we're living on an island of economic growth.''
 Ted Blazer, president of the Olympic Regional Development Authority, said Gore has had a ''phenomenally strong'' season, with a significant increase in skier visits. Gore is closing in on 250,000 skier and snowboarder visits, or 150,000 more than visited a dozen years ago. That's a lot of people. Then again, many New England resorts routinely have twice as many visitors.
 ''The new lift, though, will revive the old North Creek legacy and tie it to the lift, trail and lodge improvements that have revitalized Gore,'' Mr. Blazer said. ''Gore is getting ready to blossom.''

HEADLINE: 74 Are Laid Off At Met Museum; More May Follow

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Museum of Art said Thursday that it would lay off more than a quarter of its merchandising staff, eliminating 74 jobs in addition to 53 already cut over the last year.
 It also warned that the worsening economy would most likely force it to shrink its overall work force by 10 percent -- as many as 250 full- and part-time jobs in all -- before the summer, including some in curatorial and other pivotal departments.
 These steps are partly a reflection of the problems that the museum's merchandising arm, which a year ago operated 23 stores in New York and around the country, had been facing even before the downturn. But the new round of layoffs also signals how deeply the downturn is hitting even the most prestigious and popular art institutions like the Metropolitan. 
 The museum has imposed a hiring freeze, halted merit raises and curtailed staff travel and entertainment as well as the use of temporary employees. But it said that ''prospective, significant, and long-term reductions'' in annual operating income from its endowment had made layoffs imperative. 
 The endowment is estimated to have lost about $800 million, or 28 percent of its value, since last summer, when it was worth $2.9 billion. And that estimate does not include declines since Jan. 1.
 In a letter to members last month, the museum's chairman, James R. Houghton, said, ''The Metropolitan Museum is a robust institution, but despite its manifest strengths has not been immune to the consequences of this turbulent economy.''
 In a meeting on Thursday the museum's director, Thomas P. Campbell, told staff members that no departments would be excluded from the expected reductions, which will affect a work force of about 2,500 people, from curators and administrators to guards and maintenance workers. But the officials added that the cuts would not affect the hours that the museum is open and that the museum would work to make the reductions have the smallest effect on exhibitions, conservation and other core functions.
 ''Because the Metropolitan is so large and complex an organization, whose staff possess skill sets crucial to maintaining its buildings and collections successfully, such a contraction requires a deliberate and delicate process, which museum management, while acknowledging the urgent need for reductions, is committed to undertaking with the greatest care,'' the museum said in a statement.
 Harold Holzer, a spokesman, added in an interview on Thursday, ''The goal here is that the public will see no difference in the operations of the museum.'' 
 Many other museums across the country are also retrenching in similar or more extreme ways, cutting budgets, staff and the kinds of expansion plans that seemed ubiquitous only a couple of years ago. Among the museums that have imposed layoffs are the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, which has also reduced its director's salary.
 At the Metropolitan the endowment, one of the largest in the country for a museum, pays for slightly less than a third of the $220 million operating budget. The loss to that budget is expected to be $2.2 million in the next fiscal year, and that decrease could continue or grow larger for several years because of the way the museum, like many others, parcels out money from its endowment on the basis of a rolling average. 
 Aside from the endowment's losses, the museum will receive $1.7 million less in operating help from the city this year and has been told to expect another cutback that could be as high as $2.4 million in the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. 
 Mr. Holzer said those problems had been compounded by a decline in foreign visitors, who account for 35 percent of the museum's attendance, spend more on souvenirs and tend to pay the full amount of the museum's suggested $20 entrance fee. He said after the first two quarters of this fiscal year, in which attendance was robust, the museum hoped it might meet its goal of 4.3 million visitors for the year. But it is no longer sure that it will do so, he said, even with highly anticipated exhibitions, like the Francis Bacon show opening in May and a show of treasures from ancient Afghanistan opening in June.
 The drop in attendance has hurt other sources of income like parking fees and money spent in the museum's restaurants, Mr. Holzer said, adding that officials had also noticed a ''softening'' in membership renewals.
 In his letter Mr. Houghton appealed to the public for support as the museum contends with a crisis that could last many months longer: ''It is stating the obvious -- yet urgently necessary to do so -- to acknowledge that now, more than ever, your attendance, your generosity, your understanding, and your enthusiasm for the Met are critically important to the future of this wonderful institution.''

HEADLINE: $125 Million Is Pledged To Big Medical Center

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Despite a worldwide economic decline, the nine-figure gift is not dead.
 Charles F. Feeney, the iconoclastic philanthropist known as ''the billionaire who wasn't,'' is giving $125 million to the University of California San Francisco Medical Center to support development of a complex to provide medical services to children, women and cancer patients on its new downtown campus. 
 The gift is the first of $100 million or more since last fall, according to the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. Gifts of $1 million or more fell by 33 percent in the last half of 2008, a notable exception being the $300 million donation that David G. Booth, founder and chief executive of Dimensional Fund Advisors, gave to the University of Chicago business school in November. 
 Mr. Feeney, who earned his fortune with a chain of duty-free shops, is known for his extraordinarily modest lifestyle and his many years of anonymously giving away hundreds of millions of dollars before he went public as a philanthropist in 1997.
 The new donation is the largest ever by his foundation, the Atlantic Philanthropies, though in an interview Thursday at Atlantic's offices in New York, he questioned whether it was appropriate to call the money a gift, since it is contingent on the university's ability to raise a matching amount from other donors. 
 ''If they don't raise the money, they don't get the gift, so I'm not sure you can really call it that,'' he said.
 Mr. Feeney also fretted about the timing of the fund-raising effort, noting that many prospective donors had seen their wealth cut by 40 percent or more.
 ''There is no such thing as a small gift, of course, but we'll need major gifts to achieve this goal I've set,'' he said.
 Mark R. Laret, chief executive of the medical center, said he thought the gift from Atlantic would inspire other donors. 
 Atlantic, which has plans to spend all its remaining billions in assets by 2020, works around the world on issues of aging, improving health-care delivery for the poor, providing education and health care to children, and promoting human rights.
 It is the largest supporter of the university's $1.68 billion health sciences complex on the new campus, having previously given gifts totaling $145 million for a cancer-related program and a cardiac program. 
 The new gift is to help finance hospitals with a total of 289 beds. It would put more than 1,000 people to work in construction and create several hundred long-term jobs in health care.
 Mr. Feeney is a leading proponent of giving away one's wealth while living, and his daughter Diane has also emerged as an advocate for foundations that donate more of their assets than is required by law.
 ''Just think,'' Mr. Feeney said Thursday, reflecting on the global economic downturn, ''if wealthy people had given away more of the money they had over the last decade, they wouldn't have lost it.''

HEADLINE: In City of Lawyers, Many Immigrants Fighting Deportation Go It Alone

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
In the heart of Manhattan, amid one of the greatest concentrations of legal muscle in the world, hundreds of New York's immigrant poor are locked up with no access to a lawyer as they fight deportation. 
 Robert A. Katzmann, a federal judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, believes that fact alone should summon the city's legal profession to do more volunteer work in the immigration court system, where no defendant has the right to a court-appointed lawyer, and some of the most vulnerable end up in the hands of fly-by-night operators who bungle cases wholesale. 
 But Judge Katzmann, son of a refugee from Nazi Germany and grandson of immigrants from Russia, found that in the nation's historic gateway to immigrants, few big corporate law firms seemed to hear that summons -- even as the consequences of no lawyers or bad lawyers flooded the federal appeals courts, including his own. 
 So the judge took a rare step: Almost alone among the nation's federal judges, he has used the prestige of his office to push for more and better legal representation of immigrants. 
 What started as a lecture to the city's bar association two years ago and quietly evolved into a 7:45 a.m. ''study group,'' has turned into a movement that filled an amphitheater at Fordham Law School on Wednesday afternoon, drawing high-powered lawyers, judges, academics and city officials who talked bluntly about a dysfunctional system and brainstormed into the night. 
 ''Justice should not depend on the income level of immigrants,'' Judge Katzmann told the group at the outset of this ''working colloquium,'' seen by some as a model for circuits around the country. Studies show immigrants with legal representation are three to four times more likely to win their case, yet nationwide, only about 35 percent have any kind of lawyer. With 39 percent of the Second Circuit's caseload now made up of immigration appeals, he said in an interview, he considers his effort part of any judge's responsibility to improve the administration of justice. 
 But the economic tailspin threatens cutbacks at big firms that do pro bono work, and immigration has always been a stepchild of their charitable efforts, many at the Fordham symposium agreed. And though his challenge to the bar has spurred some new partnerships between nonprofits and private law firms, including a fledgling ''Know Your Rights'' program at the detention center at Varick and Houston Streets, ''the legal needs of the immigrant poor are largely unfulfilled,'' he said. 
 The Varick Street detention center, operated for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of Homeland Security, illustrates one part of the problem. Closed after 9/11 and reopened a year ago, it now mixes noncriminals swept up in immigration raids with legal immigrants who have criminal convictions that may make them deportable, said Sarah M. Burr, assistant chief immigration judge, one of the panelists.
 Leaders of the fledgling legal triage program said it has only enough volunteers to talk privately with a dozen of the 250 men held there, a few subway stops from federal and state courthouses and the skyscraping headquarters of international legal firms. Hundreds more immigrant New Yorkers are detained in New Jersey jails where few or no free lawyers visit regularly. 
 Even paid lawyers are more reluctant to take on detention cases, because many are quickly transferred, as far away as detention centers in Texas. And once lawyers have told the immigration court they are taking a case, judges will not let them withdraw, even when the client is a thousand miles away. 
 Two judges at Varick Street now handle 500 to 800 cases apiece, with 950 cases pending. At 26 Federal Plaza, where 22 judges with 26,400 pending cases preside over a wide range of hearings on immigrants who are not detained, Judge Burr said an already crushing caseload is now swamped with many who should not have been placed in deportation proceedings by the government in the first place.
 She cited the case of a student ordered to defend himself against deportation because the government suspected his visa had lapsed. In fact, it had not, ''but it took three or four court appearances to determine that.''
 While money for judges, clerks and free legal services is short, the Department of Homeland Security has been very well financed, she noted.
 ''They have tons of new lawyers who are raring to go, and now they're just arresting lots of people and shoveling them into immigration court,'' she said.
 Meanwhile, with hard times making the politics of immigration ever more contentious and the layoffs of thousands of lawyers at New York firms, many are reluctant to give money and staff to any but the most popular causes, said Robert E. Juceam, director of the Pro Bono Institute, and of counsel to Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. 
 He urged participants to redouble their efforts to enlist alumni groups, retired colleagues and the myriad lawyers in civil service into the corps of volunteers.
 In New York, bad or overwhelmed lawyers are the bane of courts in which a high percentage of immigrants who are fighting deportation but who have not been detained have some kind of representation. 
 The regulatory framework for rooting out the bad guys -- including nonlawyers like travel agents and so-called notarios -- is still a work in progress, acknowledged another participant, Carol A. Robles-Roman, deputy mayor for legal affairs and counsel to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg who said immigrant communities must learn to stop hiring bad lawyers. 
 ''The risks are huge,'' said Claudia Slovinsky, a widely respected immigration lawyer who sometimes represents people whose cases were mishandled by others, including lawyers who mistakenly instructed clients to apply for residency when they were not yet eligible. ''Before they used to just deny the application and stick it away in a warehouse. Now they have the power to put the person into removal proceedings.''
 Denny Chin, a United States district judge who was to hear the guilty plea of the swindler Bernard L. Madoff the next day, took time on Wednesday to remind the group of how much is at stake in immigration cases. He told of his grandfather, born in China, who somehow came to the United States in 1916, when the Chinese Exclusion Act was in effect. He told of his own father, born in China in the 1930s, who toiled as a waiter in New York until he could become a citizen in 1947, and bring over his wife and children as refugees from Hong Kong in 1953.
 Now Judge Chin said he gives the oath of citizenship to hundreds of immigrants in the same court room where his father became a citizen. He shows them his father's naturalization certificate, and tells them about his grandfather, ''how hard he worked, so that I, the son of a seamstress and a cook, became a federal judge.''

HEADLINE: Lifesaving Kidney Treatment, but Only to a Point

BYLINE: By DAVID TULLER

 BODY:
Margaret Oliver, a 47-year-old hairdresser in Venice, Calif., received a lifesaving kidney transplant in 2002. The government covered the costs under a special Medicare program for the hundreds of thousands of Americans with kidney failure who need either dialysis or a transplant. 
 Three years later, Medicare stopped paying for the expensive immunosuppressive drugs that Ms. Oliver needed to minimize the risk that her body would reject the organ. Because her kidney was functioning successfully at that point, she was no longer considered to be suffering from end-stage disease and so no longer qualified for the special coverage. 
 With the drugs costing about $800 a month, Ms. Oliver, who was self-employed, was able to buy them only sporadically, which endangered her transplanted organ. ''It was horrifying,'' Ms. Oliver said. ''I just didn't know what to do.''
 Chronic kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease, is the only condition for which Medicare extends coverage to everyone, and not just to those who already qualify because of age or disability. The kidney program, mandated by Congress in 1973 after legislative hearings about the social and economic costs of dialysis and kidney failure, has been credited with greatly expanding access to treatment in subsequent decades. 
 The program also covers 80 percent of the cost of immunosuppressive drugs, but only for 36 months after a transplant for patients who do not otherwise qualify for Medicare. 
 This week Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, introduced legislation that would require Medicare to cover the drugs for the life of the transplanted kidney. A similar bill introduced in the last Congress languished in committee.
 ''This is one of the principal things we can do to help people keep the first transplant they get,'' said John Davis, chief executive of the National Kidney Foundation.
 For years, advocates for people with kidney failure have criticized the three-year limit as costly from a medical and economic perspective and as an unfair burden on patients with few resources. Although there are no exact numbers on how many patients have lost transplanted kidneys after Medicare coverage for their drugs lapsed, nephrologists and transplant surgeons routinely cite examples of such cases from their practices. 
 Ms. Oliver, the hairdresser, was unable to get prescription drug coverage under the recently established Medicare Part D program, since Part D does not cover those who are only in Medicare because of end-stage renal disease. She finally managed to obtain coverage through a state-sponsored program for high-risk individuals. But the many months of interrupted treatment significantly weakened her new kidney and increased the chances that she will lose it in the near future, said Dr. Stanley C. Jordan, Ms. Oliver's surgeon and the medical director of the kidney transplant program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
 ''So far she is doing okay, but she will likely return to dialysis at some point in the next one to two years,'' Dr. Jordan wrote in an e-mail message.
 Transplantation is recommended people with advanced kidney failure who are healthy enough to undergo the surgery. It generally provides better long-term outcomes and a higher quality-of-life than dialysis, which can be a grueling regimen and take a serious toll on other organ systems in the body. Many patients must remain on dialysis for years while they await a suitable organ for donation. 
 And experts say some patients choose not to get transplants because they are worried about not being able to afford the immunosuppressive medications in the future. Because of the drug coverage limit, transplant centers also must consider patients' ability to sustain a long-term medication regimen when deciding whether to accept them.
 Patients need to take the drugs for as long as they have the transplanted kidney. While many organ recipients are able to obtain health insurance through employers or spouses, others, like Ms. Oliver, find themselves with few options in the private insurance marketplace. If they lose the kidney, they have to return to dialysis -- which Medicare will cover -- and return to the organ waiting list. 
 Moreover, there is no guarantee that a second matching kidney will be found for them or, if one is, that they will still be healthy enough to receive another transplant.
 Medicare spends on average $17,000 a year for the immunosuppressive drugs for a kidney transplant recipient, compared to about $70,000 for a year of dialysis, according to the National Kidney Foundation. A transplant costs more than $100,000. 
 ''Kidney transplantation is cost-effective versus dialysis, and the government has to pay for one or the other,'' said Dr. Mark D. Stegall, surgical director of the Mayo Clinic's kidney transplant program. ''Most transplant programs try their best to help the patients, but I think there are centers that turn people down or strongly discourage people from getting transplanted if they don't have coverage.''

276TH BIRTHDAY
 At Bowling Green
 As the city's oldest public park, Bowling Green, the uneven gated ellipse at the foot of Broadway, evokes history more than most spots in New York City. Legend has it that Indian tribal leaders used the land for meetings and to negotiate the sale of Manhattan to Peter Minuit in 1626. 
 Here are more notable dates from Bowling Green's history, in light of the 276th anniversary of its designation, which city officials celebrated on Thursday:
 1686 The British declared the land public property. 
 MARCH 12, 1733 The land was leased for one peppercorn a year to John Chambers, Peter Bayard and Peter Jay, who improved the site with a bowling green, trees and a wood fence. 
 JULY 9, 1776 After the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence, angry residents pulled down a gilded statue of King George III that had been erected in 1770. 
 1819 The Common Council allowed neighbors to tend the land in return for the exclusive use of the park by their families. Not until about 1850, according to the Encyclopedia of New York City, did the public gain full access to the park.
 1939 The park, disrupted by the construction of the I.R.T. subway, was repaired for the World's Fair. 
 1977 Neglected for decades, Bowling Green was renovated, with a central fountain donated by George T. Delacorte.
 1989 ''Charging Bull,'' the bronze sculpture by Arturo DiModica, was installed. Meant to represent the strength and virility of Wall Street, the bull has since been reinterpreted in light of the economic collapse.

 TAKING
 QUESTIONS
 This week on the blog, Joel Kotkin, below, a co-author of ''Reviving the City of Aspiration,'' a study of the challenges facing the city's middle class, is answering selected readers' questions. Here's an excerpt:
 Q. Sometimes I wonder if it is inevitable that cities like New York, San Francisco and London will lose their middle class as the city evolves and gentrifies. I also wonder if there is a link between the role finance plays in a city's economy and the presence or lack of a strong middle class. Ellie
 A. There is little question that as an economy focuses on finance, it tends to lose its middle-class focus. This is particularly true today, as many of the midlevel finance positions have been shipped to lower-cost areas , or automated.
 Finance has some negative social effects, particularly as it becomes globalized. The entire culture of ''high'' finance revolves around hierarchy. 
 New York, however, is not totally like San Francisco. It is much bigger, is less narcissistic and has more of an aspirational culture. But San Francisco is one possible future, particularly for Manhattan. But it is not just finance, it is trustafarians -- those beneficiaries of the upper classes -- the students and the servants who make San Francisco oddly neo-Victorian.
 This is not what I would like to see for Manhattan, and it would not work for the other boroughs. There are just not enough rich people willing to pay a fortune to live in Bayside or Laurelton.

HEADLINE: Problem For Bankers? The Rules

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
If mark-to-market accounting is to blame for the current financial crisis, then the National Weather Service is to blame for Hurricane Katrina; if it hadn't told us the hurricane hit New Orleans, the city would never have flooded.
 This is the logic the bankers are using, and they are getting sympathetic ears in Congress. The bankers have gotten two members of Congress to introduce a bill to establish a new body that could suspend accounting rules for financial institutions. 
 Edward L. Yingling, the president of the American Bankers Association, says the proposal addresses ''systemic risks that accounting standards can have on the economy.'' 
 Steve Forbes, the publisher and erstwhile presidential candidate, goes even further. ''Mark-to-market accounting is the principal reason why our financial system is in a meltdown,'' he wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece. 
 They say the problem, in short, is not that the banks acted irresponsibly in creating financial instruments that blew up, or in making loans that could never be repaid. It is that someone is forcing them to fess up. If only the banks could pretend the assets were valuable, then the system would be safe.
 On Thursday, members of a House subcommittee joined in demanding that the rules be suspended. It was a bipartisan lynching of the accounting rule writers.
 The panel's chairman, Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, Democrat of Pennsylvania, said the accounting rule ''does provide transparency for investors,'' but that ''strict application'' of the rule had ''exacerbated the ongoing economic crisis.''
 Then he issued the threat. ''If the regulators and standard setters do not act now to improve the standards, then the Congress will have no other option than to act itself.''
 Sadly, a victory for the bankers would not help them much. Even if it were true that banks would be held in higher regard now if they had not been forced to write down the value of their bad assets -- and that is, at best, debatable -- changing the rules now would be counterproductive. Would you trust banks more? Would other banks be more inclined to trust banks? 
 It is true, as the bankers argue, that valuing illiquid instruments is tricky. And it is true that markets can overshoot. Some of these securities may well be undervalued now. But the solution is not to go to what Robert H. Herz, the chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, calls ''mark-to-management'' accounting.
 I call it ''Alice in Wonderland'' accounting, after Humpty Dumpty's claim in that book that ''When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less.'' After Alice protests, he replies, ''The question is, which is to be master -- that's all.''
 Although you would not know it from the angry complaints, the accounting board's Statement 157 did not require mark-to-market accounting. That was already required under earlier rules. What it did do was clarify how such values should be determined. That stopped banks from defining ''market value'' as meaning whatever they chose it to mean. 
 Conrad Hewitt, who was chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission when it conducted a Congressionally mandated review of the issue late last year, said at a recent Pace University accounting forum that he asked all the complainers if they had a better way to determine market value than the one prescribed by Statement 157. None did.
 That statement set out procedures for dealing with illiquid markets and distress sales, and the board is now at work on setting out more guidelines on how to do that. You can bet that its efforts will not satisfy the banks.
 But there are three steps that could improve the situation.
 First, the regulators could make it clear they are committed to what is now called countercyclical regulating. They could ease capital rules when things are bad, and require more capital as the economy improves. As Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said this week, regulations should allow capital ''to serve its intended role as a buffer -- one built up during good times and drawn down during bad times in a manner consistent with safety and soundness.''
 In other words, accept that market values are low and report the facts to investors. But give the banks a break by not acting as if that will last forever. 
 Of course, many will doubt that the regulators will really get tough when things improve. They stood by mutely while the banks went on the binge that created this crisis. But we can hope. 
 The second step would be to force banks to disclose -- to the public and to the other banks that trade with them -- just which toxic assets they own.
 The bankers assert that those assets are now trading for less than they will be worth at maturity. In fact that is unknowable, which is one reason we have markets. If the current deep recession turns into Great Depression II, then even today's market values may prove to be too high.
 But if we knew which securities each bank owned, and where it was valuing them, we could go over each security and reach our own conclusions as to values. We could also see which banks seemed to be more or less optimistic in their estimates of market value.
 When I suggested that to a top official of one big bank, he dismissed the idea, saying it would damage his bank's trading position to advertise what it had. Of course, he also complained that there was virtually no trading going on, so I'm not sure what the damage would be. But if the banks want to disclose the information with a three-month delay, so that there is no way to know if they still own the securities, that would be fine with me.
 The final step would be to get the market for such securities functioning. Right now, it is largely blocked by the Obama administration's slow efforts to design a program to stimulate such sales by offering generous financing and partial guarantees to buyers. No one wants to buy now if a much better deal might be available next week. The Treasury Department needs to get the details out, and then see who is willing to buy, and at what price.
 Of course, any such government-subsidized market would need to make widely available what was on offer, to assure that the price received was the best one possible. It's not a market price if market participants cannot bid.
 It is possible that there will be few trades even then. Edward J. Kane, a finance professor at Boston College, suggests that banks, particularly those that know they need a miracle to regain solvency, will be unwilling to sell. ''Cheap volatile assets with a huge upside are precisely the kinds of optionlike investments that clever zombie managers are energetically looking for,'' he said. If they soar, the banks' stock may be worth something. If not, the taxpayers will take the loss.
 Next time you hear a banker denounce mark-to-market rules, ask if he runs his business that way. Will he offer you a mortgage loan based on what you think your home should be worth, which you can repay only if you make a lot more money than anyone will pay you? If so, then perhaps the bank should be able to use ''Alice in Wonderland'' accounting on its own books.
 Or maybe that is not such a good idea. The banks already tried that, with liars' loans. Those loans did not work out so well.

HEADLINE: Forget Britney; Media Outrage Hits Big Spenders

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
It could be called ''To Catch a Rich Guy.'' 
 The celebrity Web site TMZ and TV shows like ''Extra'' and ''Inside Edition'' are expanding their coverage of starlets and Hollywood break-ups to include billion-dollar business scandals and the economic collapse. 
 A camera crew for ''Extra,'' the syndicated entertainment show, huddled alongside the BBC and The Associated Press outside the courtroom as Bernard L. Madoff pleaded guilty on Thursday. That night, the show started by calling him ''the most hated man in America.'' The previous evening, ''Inside Edition'' profiled one of Mr. Madoff's victims who testified in court, a 60-year-old woman who lost millions and had to go to work as a maid. 
 The tabloid media, of course, have always peered into the excesses of the rich and famous with a mix of puritan disapproval and voyeurism. But these outlets and other news organizations are now recording troubling uses of taxpayer money at country clubs, private airports and glamorous retreats and, in so doing, explicitly tapping into a fierce populist anger at corporate America, and even pressuring Congress to hold companies accountable.
 TMZ, a Web site better known for unflattering paparazzi shots of Britney Spears and Rihanna, drove mainstream coverage and Congressional outrage with a blog post late last month that exclaimed, ''Bailout Bank Blows Millions Partying in L.A.'' The site reported that Northern Trust, a bank that received $1.6 billion in taxpayer money, had hosted hundreds of clients and employees at a golf tournament and a series of parties in Southern California. ''Your tax dollars, hard at work,'' the site wrote. 
 Northern Trust never sought the bailout funds, but agreed to take them last fall at the behest of the government. Regardless, the photos of Tiffany gift bags and the grainy video clips of Chicago and Sheryl Crow performing for the group angered readers --as well as Congressional Democrats, who demanded in a letter that Northern Trust repay what the company ''frittered away on these lavish events.'' The bank said it would do so ''as quickly as prudently possible,'' news that earned four exclamation points from TMZ. 
 Harvey Levin, the editor of TMZ, who called the story ''the most important thing we've ever done,'' knows his readers don't come to the site for a dissertation on mortgage-backed securities. ''It's hard for people to wrap their heads around $800 billion in bailout money. It's too big a thing,'' he said. ''It's much easier to understand paying for a Sheryl Crow concert.'' 
 ''Britney is fluff,'' said Rory Waltzer, a photographer for TMZ, ''but the stories about Northern Trust and Madoff and politicians in D.C. really have an impact on the country.'' 
 Tabloids aren't the only ones wagging their fingers. In recent months, network news divisions have relied more heavily on watchdog segments that, producers believe, resonate with viewers who are angry about their own economic status. 
 Sharyl Attkisson, an investigative correspondent who contributes weekly ''Follow the Money'' segments for the ''CBS Evening News,'' said visual proof of what could be excessive spending ''taps into a lot of outrage'' that Americans feel about the economy.
 Tracking the private jets, lavish junkets and other trappings of what the ABC correspondent Brian Ross calls ''corporate royalty'' are now full-time jobs for reporters at the network news divisions. Next week NBC News will show a three-part investigative series in prime time titled ''Inside the Financial Fiasco'' and reported by Chris Hansen, the ''Dateline NBC'' correspondent who hosted the network's ''To Catch a Predator'' franchise for years.
 For the reporters, the heightened interest in corporate spending means long hours staking out places like Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, an airport that is frequently used for private travel into New York. On the last Friday in February, the ABC producer Asa Eslocker was on assignment outside the airport, armed with a miniature camera and searching for a corporate jet belonging to a troubled insurance company. 
 While there, Mr. Eslocker discovered that a jet belonging to Bank of America was on the move. A $50 million Gulfstream G5 was about to shuttle Kenneth D. Lewis, the embattled chief executive of Bank of America, from Charlotte, N.C., to Teterboro. 
 ABC scrambled camera crews at both airports, and by the time Mr. Lewis touched down, the network had a helicopter hovering above to film his expensive arrival. 
 ''The corporate jets never cease to disappoint,'' said Rhonda Schwartz, the chief of investigative projects for ABC News. ''It's like they never get the message.''
 The video clips of Mr. Lewis exiting his private plane were featured on ''Good Morning America'' the next day, along with the amount of government support the bank has received ($45 billion), the number of jets in the bank's fleet (nine), an estimated cost per hour to operate the G5 (at least $5,000), and a listing for a comparable commercial flight at the same time ($440). 
 Perhaps the most memorable tale of corporate excess came in November when ABC reported that the chief executives of the three biggest American automakers had flown to Washington on private jets to plead for infusions of taxpayer money. That revelation prompted tongue-lashings by members of Congress and long rides back to Washington by the executives in hybrid cars in December. 
 ''Some people said, 'What does that have to do with the larger, overriding issue of the economy?' I think it reflected their attitude of entitlement and failure to adapt to the times, a kind of a tin ear to what's going on,'' Mr. Ross said in an interview.
 Incriminating pictures stop the companies from denying the stories, essentially catching them in the act, Mr. Ross added. Rather than trying to induce shame, he said, ''what we reveal is that there's no shame.''

HEADLINE: While Everyone Fiddles

 BODY:
The world economy has plunged into what is likely to be the most brutal recession since the 1930s, yet policy makers in Europe and Japan seem to believe there are more important things for them to do than to try to dig the world, including themselves, out. 
 When Lawrence Summers, President Obama's top economic adviser, urged countries to increase public spending to boost global demand, Luxembourg's finance minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, representing the European Union, responded that the prescription was ''not to our liking.'' 
 At a meeting this week ahead of an April summit of the world's largest economies, finance ministers from the European Union declared that they have already done enough to add to domestic demand. In Frankfurt, Axel Weber, the chief of the German central bank added, ''We have reached our limits.'' Japan's government is quieter but nearly as resistant. 
 The United States, which has approved two stimulus packages, plans to spend about 4.8 percent of its gross domestic product by 2010. China is planning to spend nearly 6 percent of its G.D.P. on stimulus programs over the next two years, according to the International Monetary Fund. These numbers are still too small. Yet Europe and Japan are lagging further behind. Germany 's fiscal boost will amount to just 3.5 percent of its G.D.P. France plans to spend 1.4 percent spread over the next two years, and Britain 1.3 percent. Japan expects to spend 2.2 percent of its G.D.P.
 Japan, which struggled with a recession throughout the 1990s, is constrained by a weak government and an enormous pile of debt. Europe, by contrast, has room to spend. But the bigger European countries that share the euro as their currency worry that running big budget deficits will undermine investors' faith in their economies over the long term and weaken the currency. 
 Given the current calamity, these concerns seem woefully misguided.
 With consumer spending and business investment collapsing around the world, wealthy countries are pretty much the only ones left with the capacity to increase demand to mitigate the economic slump. The price of inaction is getting higher by the day. The World Bank is now forecasting that the global economy will contract this year for the first time since World War II. 
 What makes this especially puzzling is that the economic data out of Europe and Japan are horrendous. Industrial production in France collapsed 14 percent in January, compared with the year-earlier month. German exports -- the pillar of that nation's economy -- plummeted 21 percent. Consumer and business confidence also are sinking. The European Central Bank expects the euro-zone economy to shrink by 2.2 percent to 3.3 percent this year. The I.M.F. expects Japan's to slip by 2.6 percent. 
 In 1933, a global conference in London to plot a path out of a worldwide depression collapsed in acrimony. Next month, the leaders of the world's 20 biggest economies are scheduled to gather in London and give the format another try, meeting to discuss how to fix the global financial system and restore growth. 
 The world will be much better off if they can agree on three things: to substantially increase fiscal spending at home, to provide financing for poorer countries that cannot do so on their own, and to avoid, by all means necessary, protectionist beggar-thy-neighbor policies that could set the recovery back for years. 
 In a recent speech, Christina Romer, another of President Obama's economic advisers, pointed out some lessons from the Great Depression: fiscal stimulus works. And the more countries around the world that do it, ''the better off we will all be.'' Europe and Japan should listen. So should Washington.

HEADLINE: How To Surge The Taliban

BYLINE: By MAX BOOT, FREDERICK KAGAN and KIMBERLY KAGAN. 
Max Boot is a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Frederick Kagan is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Kimberly Kagan is the president of the Institute for the Study of War.

DATELINE: Kandahar, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
 ''DONT worry, we are not going to lose this war.'' 
 These were the parting words to us from Brig. Gen. Sher Muhammad Zazai, commander of the 205th Corps of the Afghan National Army in Kandahar. He was echoing the sentiments of a group of village elders we had met days before in Khost Province, who assured us that they would never allow the Taliban to come back. 
 It is odd that the Afghans felt it necessary to reassure American visitors that all was far from lost. It reflected the fact that even in a country where electricity and running water are scarce, word of the defeatist hysteria now gripping some in the American political elite has spread.
 No one in Afghanistan -- from the American commander, Gen. David McKiernan, to those village elders -- underestimates the difficulties that lie ahead. But no one we spoke to on an eight-day journey (arranged for us by Gen. David Petraeus, the head of the military's Central Command) that took us from Kunar Province on the Pakistan border to Farah Province near the Iranian frontier doubted that we can succeed, or that we must do so. 
 The main challenge is to overcome years of chronic neglect in terms of economic development, government services and above all security, which has allowed the insurgency free access to large swaths of the country. The good news is that the Taliban holds little appeal for most Afghans -- a BBC-ABC News poll last month showed only 4 percent desired Taliban rule. The Sunni and Shiite insurgencies in Iraq, by contrast, maintained much greater support in their respective communities until they were defeated.
 Even without much popular backing, Afghan insurgents are staging an increasing number of attacks, but major cities like Kabul and Jalalabad, which we visited, are relatively safe and flourishing. The civilian death toll in Afghanistan last year was 16 times lower than that in Iraq in the pre-surge year of 2006, even though Afghanistan is more populous. 
 There is no question that we can succeed against these much weaker foes, notwithstanding the support they receive from Pakistan and to a lesser extent Iran. President Obama's recent decision to send 17,000 additional troops is a good start. While increased security operations will result in a temporary increase in casualties, that spike should be followed by broad reductions in violence, just as with the Iraq surge. 
 Efforts to develop a countrywide strategy will no doubt be hampered by the confused and often counterproductive NATO command structure. A big part of the problem is that, unlike American headquarters staff members who train together for a year before deploying into a combat zone, NATO staff members from many nations come together for the first time just a few weeks before heading out to Afghanistan. And most of them rotate out after six months; a lack of continuity means a lack of cohesion. A NATO officer even admitted to us that his headquarters is ''partially dysfunctional.'' 
 To see the impact of the splintered command structure, look at the drug interdiction. NATO's forces can't do antidrug missions, but they can provide assistance like air support and medevac units to American military advisers embedded with Afghan Army units involved with poppy eradication. Thus NATO plays a key role in individual antidrug operations, but there is no way to integrate its forces into broader counternarcotics efforts.
 American and allied officers are trying to work around such obstacles, and should be aided by the recent creation of a United States Forces-Afghanistan headquarters in Kabul to coordinate with NATO. Still, more needs to be done to develop a comprehensive counterinsurgency plan, even if that risks alienating some of the 41 coalition countries. 
 Such a plan will probably require American forces beyond those already on their way, but the overall requirement will remain well below that of Iraq. Seven American ground brigades are likely to be in Afghanistan by the end of the year -- two of them focused on training and the rest on combat. Two or three more might be needed next year to provide security in western Afghanistan, which has almost no United States forces. That would result in 45,000 to 55,000 ground troops, plus support units, as compared to more than 160,000 (22 brigades) in Iraq at the height of the surge. 
 In addition to sending more soldiers, we must also increase our efforts to expand the Afghan security forces. It may be impossible to speed up the pace of building the Afghan National Army, but the current proposed end-strength of 134,000 troops is far too low. We should immediately commit to a goal of 250,000 troops for the army, and a substantial increase in the national police as well. Afghan troops also need lots of better equipment -- everything from armored vehicles to night-vision goggles.
 One glaring lacuna in the international effort is the lack of focus on developing a justice system. NATO forces are not authorized to detain enemy combatants for more than 96 hours, after which they must be turned over to Afghan authorities. Some American forces have more latitude, but they are holding only 621 detainees, compared to the 24,000 detained in Iraq at the height of the surge. Insurgents taken prisoner by Afghan forces are generally released by the ineffective judicial system. 
 The lack of a functioning legal system not only makes it harder to quell the violence but provides an opening to insurgents who run their own Shariah courts. So, while the long-term solution is to help Afghanistan build a court system (something that isn't getting the attention it deserves), the American military should also expand its detention facilities and press for expanded detention authority.
 There are many who claim that a large-scale commitment isn't necessary. Some say we have no interest in making Afghanistan a functioning state -- all that matters is preventing Al Qaeda from re-establishing safe havens, and we can do that by killing terrorist leaders with precision air strikes or covert raids. 
 The key question for those who advocate pulling back is this: Where will we get the intelligence to direct the raids? If we have few troops on the ground, we will have to rely on intercepted communications. But seven years into the fight, the terrorists have learned a thing or two about keeping their communications secret. The only way to get the intelligence we need is from the residents, and they won't provide it unless our troops stay in their villages to provide protection from Taliban retribution.
 This struggle is not just about Afghanistan. It is also about tracking and effecting what is going on in Pakistan's tribal areas. That is where the global Qaeda leadership is. It is the nexus of terrorist groups including the Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is implicated in the Mumbai, India, attacks last November; the Tehreek Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi, which now has control of the Swat region in Pakistan; and Baitullah Mehsud's Pakistani Taliban, which are said to have plotted the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the former Pakistani prime minister. 
 From their positions across the border in Afghanistan, American forces can literally see these areas. They can also gather invaluable intelligence from, and spread our influence to, the tribes that straddle the frontier. But we get that vantage point only as long as we have something to offer the Afghans -- security,improved quality of life, hope for a better government. If we abandon them, we will become blind to one of the most dangerous threats to our security, and also hand our most determined enemies an enormous propaganda victory -- their biggest since 9/11. 
 Make no mistake: there is hard, costly fighting ahead in Afghanistan. But the fight is worth pursuing, and the odds of success are much better than they were in Iraq when we launched the forlorn hope known as the surge.

HEADLINE: The Rich: Can't Live With Them, Can't Live Without Them

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Let's give a shout-out to Tevye the Dairyman, whose creator, the pseudonymous Sholom Aleichem, was born in czarist Russia 150 years ago this month. This great Yiddish writer made his way to America, and died in New York in 1916 at age 57. On May 16 of that year, The New York Times described how 100,000 people, ''with sadness in their faces,'' lined the streets watching his funeral procession pass through the Lower East Side.
 The 150th anniversary has been celebrated by some Jewish groups, with inevitable references to Tevye. He is the most enduring Sholom Aleichem character, probably best known to Americans in his ''Fiddler on the Roof'' incarnation, singing about tradition and how good his life would be if he were a rich man -- daidle deedle daidle deedle daidle daidle deedle dum. 
 So, Tevye, we have a tip for you. Here's how life would be if you lived not in some shtetl but in modern New York. The mayor would hug you. He really would. He pretty much said so himself.
 ''You know, the yelling and screaming about the rich -- we want rich from around this country to move here,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said a few days ago. ''We love the rich people.''
 His words sounded to some like amour-propre: Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the richest of them all? You are, the mirror answers him.
 Mr. Bloomberg is the richest in New York, anyway. So says Forbes magazine, which on Wednesday issued its latest roster of the world's billionaires. It put his net worth at $16 billion. Among the top 25 people on the list, he alone is described as worth more now than a year ago. If you had that kind of dough, you'd love rich people, too.
 Naturally, the mayor's remarks did not sit well with everyone. Opponents offered it as one more example of how he ''doesn't get it'' -- whatever ''it'' is supposed to be. This has been a recurring refrain among his critics, who seem to suggest that to be genuinely smart in this town, you have to be poor. So with $16 billion in his kick, this guy must be really, really dumb.
 Flawed as that logic is, Mr. Bloomberg may find his ''love the rich'' line coming back to bite him as he diverts a thick slice of his bankroll to run for a third term. His words were, at a minimum, infelicitous. While he has worked hard to learn Spanish, he can get so tangled up in English that you sometimes have to wonder if it is not his true second language.
 What he tried to say was that rich people disproportionately finance municipal services for the less fortunate. Figures from his budget office show that people earning $500,000 or more a year make up 1 percent of New York taxpayers but account for nearly 50 percent of the income taxes that the city collects.
 Mr. Bloomberg opposes proposals in these tough times to increase the tax rate for the highfliers. These people have the means to move elsewhere, he says, and some of them will do so, taking their taxable stash with them and leaving the municipal treasury the poorer. Not everyone, of course, buys into that argument.
 But then, that's the problem most of us have with the very rich. You can't live with 'em, but you can't live without 'em. The same may be said of the Forbes billionaires.
 The past year has been awful for them. Worldwide, their numbers fell to 793 from 1,125. Their total net worth shriveled to $2.4 trillion from $4.4 trillion. The 359 American billionaires were 110 fewer than a year ago. Among cities, New York had the most, but there were 71 of them in 2008 and 55 today.
 Is that your lower lip quivering in sympathy for the dears?
 ''Obviously, no tears will be shed for the fact that billionaires have gone down in their net worth,'' Steve Forbes, the magazine's editor in chief, told a gathering of thousandaires, more commonly known as journalists. He got that right.
 But bear in mind, Mr. Forbes said, that most billionaires are innovators. They create jobs. 
 ''They make it possible for people to get ahead and realize their dreams and ambitions,'' he said.
 The good news from his perspective is that billionaires will always be with us. The names may change, Mr. Forbes said, but new fortunes will emerge, even from the ashes of the present economic flameout. ''Anytime you have this kind of financial earthquake, new players emerge,'' he said.
 If he is correct, Tevye, it's good news for you and other dreamers just like you. You may yet be a rich man, daidle deedle and all.

HEADLINE: Obama Defends Agenda As More Than Recession

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama rejected on Thursday criticism that he is trying to do too much at once by advancing ambitious plans on health care, energy and education at the same time that he is struggling with perhaps the worst economic crisis in generations.
 As many in both parties question his approach, Mr. Obama insisted that the only way to build a strong economy that will truly last was to address underlying problems in American society like unaffordable health care, dependence on foreign oil and underperforming schools. 
 ''I'm not choosing to address these additional challenges just because I feel like it or because I'm a glutton for punishment,'' he told a gathering of corporate leaders. ''I'm doing so because they're fundamental to our economic growth and ensuring that we don't have more crises like this in the future. You see, we cannot go back to endless cycles of bubble and bust.''
 The speech to the Business Roundtable was aimed at countering unease in Washington over the scale of the president's agenda, given the country's deep and unrelenting economic travails. The investor Warren E. Buffett, a strong Obama supporter, captured the sentiment this week when he said ''job 1 is to win the war, the economic war; job 2 is to win the economic war, and job 3.''
 Concern is growing in some quarters that the president's initiatives have not been enough to turn the economy around. Some economists previously cited by the White House now predict that Mr. Obama's $787 billion stimulus package will create or save only 2.5 million jobs, instead of the 3.5 million he promised. Even that would fall short of the 4.4 million jobs lost since the recession began. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, left the door open to a second stimulus package.
 But Mr. Obama has not been content to deal just with the immediate crisis as he works to get stimulus money out the door, stabilize fragile banks and ease the housing crisis. He has also begun efforts to rewrite the tax code to shift the burden to the rich; to bring down health costs and expand access to insurance; and to increase alternative energy supplies while imposing a market-based cap on pollution blamed for climate change.
 Aides said that represents a more sustained approach than patching the economy until the next bubble, like the technology bubble of the 1990s and the housing bubble of the 2000s. 
 In his speech and in answer to questions from preselected corporate executives, Mr. Obama said critics were overreacting, because many of these plans would take years to put in place.
 ''When we issued the budget,'' the president said, ''they said, 'Boy, these Obama people, they're really ambitious. They're taking on health care. They're taking on energy. They're taking on education. Don't they know that there's this bank crisis right now? We've got to do one thing at a time.' ''
 But the budget, he noted, is a 10-year plan. ''We don't anticipate that every piece of health care is done this year,'' he said. ''We think that we've got to get the process and get in place a structure and a framework and a funding approach, and work out a lot of these details, but it's going to be implemented over time.''
 He also defended his decision not to send a detailed blueprint to Congress, letting lawmakers figure out the specifics themselves.
 ''Part of the reason that we did not simply design our own plan and try to jam it down the throats of Congress is we want them to see some of the contradictions in their own positions and, over time, you know, sort through some of those tensions, make some tough choices, working with us,'' he said.
 Still, even as he said he was not doing too much, Mr. Obama allowed that he was looking down the road. In response to a question, he said he would like to eventually lower corporate tax rates while closing loopholes that make it so complex.
 ''This isn't reflected in our current budget because we've already got a lot on our plate,'' he said. But ''that's a very appealing conversation to me and I'd like to pursue it.''

HEADLINE: Obama on Spot Over a Benefit To Gay Couples

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Just seven weeks into office, President Obama is being forced to confront one of the most sensitive social and political issues of the day: whether the government must provide health insurance benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees. 
 In separate, strongly worded orders, two judges of the federal appeals court in California said that employees of their court were entitled to health benefits for their same-sex partners under the program that insures millions of federal workers. 
 But the federal Office of Personnel Management has instructed insurers not to provide the benefits ordered by the judges, citing a 1996 law, the Defense of Marriage Act. 
 As a presidential candidate, Mr. Obama said he would ''fight hard'' for the rights of gay couples. As a senator, he sponsored legislation that would have provided health benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees. 
 Now, Mr. Obama is in a tough spot. If he supports the personnel office on denying benefits to the San Francisco court employees, he risks agitating liberal groups that helped him win election. If he supports the judges and challenges the marriage act, he risks alienating Republicans with whom he is seeking to work on economic, health care and numerous other matters. 
 Already, some gay rights groups remain upset over Mr. Obama's choice of the Rev. Rick Warren, an opponent of same-sex marriage, to give the invocation at his inauguration. Liberal groups also believe that Mr. Obama has not moved fast enough to reverse the policies of his predecessor on issues like detention and interrogation of terrorism suspects. 
 In a letter on Feb. 20 to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, an arm of the federal judiciary, Lorraine E. Dettman, assistant director of the personnel office, said, ''Plans in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program may not provide coverage for domestic partners, or legally married partners of the same sex, even though recognized by state law.'' 
 Benefits are available to the spouse of a federal employee, Ms. Dettman said, but the 1996 law stipulates that ''the word 'spouse' refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.''
 Federal officials said they had to follow the laws on the books. But Richard Socarides, a New York lawyer who was an adviser to President Bill Clinton on gay issues, said he believed that Mr. Obama ''has broad discretionary authority to find ways to ameliorate some of the more blatant examples of discrimination.''
 The orders were issued by the chief judge of the appeals court, Alex Kozinski, and another member of the court, Judge Stephen Reinhardt. 
 Judge Kozinski, often described as a libertarian or an independent conservative, and Judge Reinhardt, a liberal, ruled not as part of a lawsuit, but in their role as employers resolving employee grievances. 
 Similar issues were raised in a lawsuit filed against the federal government last week in Boston by eight same-sex couples. The administration is weighing how to respond. 
 Gay federal employees said they were denied equal compensation when their partners were denied health benefits. 
 Administration officials declined to say what they planned to do in the California cases if the judges tried to enforce their orders.
 Ben LaBolt, a White House spokesman, said: ''While the president opposes gay marriage, he supports legislative repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act. He believes this country must realize its founding promise of equality by treating all its citizens with dignity and respect.''
 Mr. Obama and his choice for director of the personnel office, M. John Berry, have endorsed the idea of providing health benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees. 
 The Office of Personnel Management estimates the cost at $670 million over 10 years. 
 Mr. Berry, who is gay, has been director of the National Zoological Park since 2005. As an Interior Department official in the Clinton administration, he developed procedures to deal with complaints of discrimination based on sexual orientation. They became a model for other agencies.
 The pending cases involve Karen Golinski, 46, a lawyer who works for the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and Brad D. Levenson, 49, a lawyer who works for the federal public defender in Los Angeles. 
 Ms. Golinski's insurance plan, offered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield, rejected her effort to obtain health benefits for her spouse, Amy Cunninghis. Mr. Levenson's insurer, a Kaiser Foundation health plan, turned down his application for his spouse, Tony Sears, based on instructions from the Office of Personnel Management.
 In Ms. Golinski's case, Judge Kozinski said that federal law authorized the Office of Personnel Management to arrange health benefits for federal employees and their family members. The law, he said, defines the ''minimum requirements'' for health insurance, but the government can provide more. 
 Judge Reinhardt confronted the question differently, and concluded that the Defense of Marriage Act, as applied to Mr. Levenson's request, was unconstitutional because it violated the Fifth Amendment guarantee of ''due process of law.''
 ''A bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot provide a rational basis for governmental discrimination,'' Judge Reinhardt wrote.
 In adopting the Defense of Marriage Act, Congress said the government had a legitimate interest in ''defending and nurturing the institution of traditional heterosexual marriage.''
 But Judge Reinhardt said the denial of benefits to same-sex spouses would not encourage gay men and lesbians to marry members of the opposite sex or discourage same-sex marriages. 
 ''So the denial cannot be said to nurture or defend the institution of heterosexual marriage,'' the judge wrote.
 Gary L. Bauer, president of American Values, a conservative advocacy group, said that if Mr. Obama extended benefits to same-sex partners of federal workers, he would ''provoke a furious grass-roots reaction, reinvigorate the conservative coalition and undermine his efforts to portray himself as a moderate on social issues.'' 
 Ms. Golinski has asked for a new hearing, where she will urge Judge Kozinski to enforce his order granting benefits to her partner. Mr. Levenson said he would soon ask Judge Reinhardt for a similar hearing.
 In addition, Congress may soon weigh in.
 Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and Representative Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, plan to introduce bills that would provide benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees.
 Similar bills died in the past. But ''the new administration will have a new view,'' Ms. Baldwin said.

HEADLINE: A Warning on Governors Island Funds

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Warning that Governors Island may be forced to shut down for lack of money, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has proposed that the city take control of the former military base so that the state can focus on other projects.
 The city and the state have jointly run the 172-acre island in the middle of New York Harbor since 2003, seeking to develop it as a unique recreational, historic and artistic destination 800 yards south of Lower Manhattan. But Gov. David A. Paterson did not put any money for the coming fiscal year into the island's operating budget, which is rapidly running out of cash.
 At a meeting of the board of directors of the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation on Thursday, Ronay Menschel, a board member, said Mayor Bloomberg had decided that the most efficient way to deal with the problem was for ''the city to take over operating responsibility for the island.'' 
 Clearly, she said, the state has struggled in dealing with Governors Island amid the state's fiscal crisis. If the island is forced to close, she said, it would be a setback just when increasing numbers of New Yorkers are visiting the island.
 ''We are just about to run out of money,'' said Ms. Menschel, who was appointed by Mayor Bloomberg.
 Although Avi Schick, the chairman of the corporation, played down the notion of a financial crisis at the meeting, the board voted to approve an austerity budget of $11.8 million, down from $18.8 million, in the hope that the governor would come up with roughly $6 million by April, the start of the next state fiscal year. The corporation says the remaining $550,000 in its operating budget will be spent before the end of this month on security and maintenance.
 Governors Island is only one of several joint city-state projects on which the Bloomberg administration has quietly sought an amicable divorce. City officials have grown increasingly frustrated with the partnerships and what they say is the state's inability to make decisions and commit money.
 In a series of meetings with the Paterson administration that began in January, the city has proposed taking sole responsibility for Brooklyn Bridge Park, a planned 85-acre park stretching 1.3 miles from the north side of the Manhattan Bridge to Atlantic Avenue, as well as Governors Island, while leaving the troubled Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to the state.
 According to both city and state officials, the city has said it would take the $300 million it had committed to expanding the convention center, on the West Side of Manhattan, and put it into the two park projects. 
 ''We would use that money to continue to develop these two things which are great parts of the city,'' Mr. Bloomberg said Thursday in response to questions from reporters. ''The city has more of an interest. I think the state government has their own problems. It's a good deal for the state. If not, they can take them over or close them down.''
 Erin Duggan, a spokeswoman for the governor, said, ''The state is working with the city to resolve the funding issue.'' As for the broader proposal to sever ties with the city on at least three projects, she declined comment, saying, ''The talks haven't reached a resolution.'' 
 In 2007, Mr. Paterson's predecessor, Eliot Spitzer, proposed using the proceeds from the sale of state-owned land next to the convention center to pay for its obligations at Brooklyn Bridge Park, Hudson River Park and Governors Island. But nothing came of it.
 Last week, state and city officials approved a $463 million renovation and expansion of the convention center, far smaller than had originally been planned, and to be financed chiefly from a hotel room tax imposed in 2005. That tax was adopted when city and state officials planned to nearly double the size of the convention center, but the new plan will add only 60,000 square feet of exhibit space. 
 At Governors Island, the city and state have committed tens of millions of dollars to capital projects, some of which are under way while others are in the planning stage. The city has also allocated millions of dollars annually for the island's operating budget but will release the money only after the state provides a comparable sum. In the current year, the state failed to put money into the budget but the corporation was able to continue operating, using excess revenue. Now that is running out. 
 The corporation expects more than 200,000 visitors to Governors Island this season, up from 128,000 last season. The season when the public has access extends from late May to mid-October. The corporation recently struck a deal with the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council to create a year-round artists' colony and to hold weekend events during the season, and work is continuing on building the New York Harbor School, a public high school. 
 New York Water Taxi has agreed to provide ferry service and plans to build a beach and a Ferris wheel on the island. And in June, the corporation will unveil designs for a 40-acre park at the southern end. 
 ''The island will be open this summer,'' Mr. Schick said in an interview after the meeting. ''We hope to exceed 200,000 visitors this year. What will attract them are the programs we've developed cooperatively over the last several years.''

HEADLINE: How to Leave Afghanistan

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB. 
Leslie H. Gelb, a former editor and columnist for The Times, is the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of the forthcoming ''Power Rules: How Common Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy.''

 BODY:
ONLY if our troop levels hit 100,000 and fighting floods over into Taliban havens in Pakistan will Washington be likely to look hard at the alternative policy for Afghanistan -- withdrawing most American forces and refocusing our power on containing, deterring and diplomatically encircling the terrorist threat. But by then it will be too late.
 President Obama is now confronting the classic problem from hell: either do more to stave off defeat and hope to get lucky, or withdraw and face charges of defeatism and perhaps new terrorist attacks. Mr. Obama's goal is to ''ensure'' that Afghanistan is not a sanctuary for terrorists, which effectively restates his campaign call for victory there. Thus, he recently decided to add 17,000 American troops to the more than 35,000 already in Afghanistan. But his goal of eliminating the Taliban threat is not achievable. 
 Mr. Obama needs to consider another path. Our strategy in Afghanistan should emphasize what we do best (containing and deterring, and forging coalitions) and downgrade what we do worst (nation-building in open-ended wars). It should cut our growing costs and secure our interests by employing our power more creatively and practically. It must also permit us -- and this is critical -- to focus more American resources and influence on the far more dire situation in Pakistan. 
 We can't defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan, as the last seven years have shown. Numbers are part of the problem: most Taliban are members of Afghanistan's majority tribe, the Pashtuns. More confounding, the Taliban and their Qaeda allies have found in northwestern Pakistan a refuge that has proved almost impregnable. These factors make overcoming the enemy in Afghanistan infinitely harder than it was in Iraq. 
 What we can do is effectively reduce the risk of terrorist attacks from Afghanistan against its neighbors, the United States and its allies. We can do this in a way that would allow for the withdrawal of American forces, though economic and military aid would continue. 
 The first step is to provide significantly increased economic support, arms and training to friendly Afghans as United States combat forces gradually depart over, say, three years. We could use the intervening time to increase present counterinsurgency operations to better protect Afghans and give them a boost to fight on their own, if they have the will. 
 The second step is to try to separate less extremist elements of the Taliban from their leadership and from Al Qaeda. Mr. Obama is already considering reaching out to Taliban moderates, and he could do this through the Afghan government and covert contacts. No group is monolithic once tested with carrots and sticks, as we saw in Northern Ireland and Iraq. 
 The Taliban are no exception. While most of them want to drive America out, they have no inherent interest in exporting terrorism. As nasty as the Taliban are, America's vital interests do not require their exclusion from power in Afghanistan, so long as they don't support international terrorists. 
 Third, while we should talk to the Taliban, Washington can't rely on their word and so must fashion a credible deterrent. The more the Taliban set up shop inside Afghanistan, the more vulnerable they will be to American punishment. Taliban leaders must have good reason to fear America's military reach. Their leaders could be hit by drones or air strikes. The same goes for their poppy fields, from which they derive considerable income. Most important, Mr. Obama must do what the Bush team inexplicably never seemed to succeed in doing -- stop the flow of funds to the Taliban that comes mainly through the Arab Gulf states. At the same time, he could let some money trickle in to reward good behavior. 
 Fourth, President Obama has to ring Afghanistan with a coalition of neighbors to show the Taliban they have no place to seek succor, even after an American departure. The group would include China, India, Russia, NATO allies, and yes, Iran. They all share a considerable interest in stemming the spread of Afghan drugs and Islamic extremism. China and Russia should be more willing to help in this anti-Taliban effort as the American military presence recedes from their sensitive borders.
 Then there's Pakistan, both the heart of the problem and the key to its solution. The peaceful future of the region depends on the resolve and ability of Pakistan's secular and moderate religious leaders to provide decent government to their people. China, India, Iran and Russia might cooperate with Washington simply because there's no motivation greater than the nightmare of extremists controlling Pakistan's nuclear weapons. 
 India in particular wants to combat extremism in Pakistan. It could do that by reducing its forces on the border with Pakistan, for example, thereby allowing Pakistani moderates to focus their attention more on the growing and already formidable extremist threat within. 
 Withdrawal need not mean defeat for America and victory for terrorists, if the full range of American power is used effectively. Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger proved that by countering the nasty aftereffects of Vietnam's fall to communism in a virtuoso display of American power. They did this by engaging in triangular diplomacy with China and the Soviet Union; brokering a de facto peace between Israel and Egypt; and re-establishing American prowess in Asia as a counterweight to emerging Chinese power. By 1978, three years after Saigon's fall, America's position in the area was stronger than at any time since the end of World War II. 
 I don't know whether the power extrication strategy sketched out here would be less or more risky than our present course. But trying to eliminate the Taliban and Qaeda threat in Afghanistan is unattainable, while finding a way to live with, contain and deter the Taliban is an achievable goal. After all, we don't insist on eliminating terrorist threats from Somalia, Yemen and Pakistan. Furthermore, this strategy of containing and deterring is far better suited to American power than the current approach of counterinsurgency and nation-building. 
 President Obama and Congress owe it to both Afghans and Americans to explore a strategy of power extrication before they make another major decision to expand the war.

HEADLINE: A Town's Wounded Pride

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C. 

 BODY:
Each workday, when the closing bell sounds on Wall Street, the mayor here in the Wall Street of the South takes stock of this city's fortunes. 
 It is not hard. If it was a good day for Bank of America, whose headquarters towers over this city and its collective psyche, then it was a good day for the people in Charlotte. But if it was a bad one -- and there have been too many of those lately -- a bit more local pride and prosperity slip away. 
 Like many people here, the mayor, Patrick McCrory, is flabbergasted by the startling fall of Bank of America and the city's other banking giant, the Wachovia Corporation. One out of every 10 people here works for one of the banks. Many more have staked retirements and savings on them in the stock market. 
 But Wachovia, a Carolina fixture since 1879, fell into the clutches of a big California bank last year. Now Bank of America too faces an uncertain future, despite two multibillion-dollar rescues from Washington. Bank of America's share price -- in a sense, a proxy for Charlotte's -- has plunged nearly 86 percent in 12 months. 
 Mr. McCrory has one word for it: ''Unbelievable.''
 Few understand the myriad challenges facing Bank of America better than Kenneth D. Lewis, the bank's battle-weary chief executive. Mr. Lewis, who turns 62 in April, must contend with restive shareholders, the fallout from a troublesome merger, and an investigation by a politically ambitious attorney general in New York -- all during the worst banking crisis since the Depression. Calls for his ouster are growing louder.
 On Thursday, Mr. Lewis offered his hometown a bit of good news. Speaking in Boston, he said Bank of America was profitable in January and February, and he predicted the bank would turn a profit for the entire year. Bank of America's stock price rose 92 cents, or more than 18 percent, to $5.85 a share -- making it a good day for Charlotte. 
 But many people, both here and on Wall Street, wonder if Mr. Lewis can deliver. While bank insiders insist the board is behind him, the grind is taking its toll. Colleagues say Mr. Lewis looks tired, and in a recent interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times, he chuckled when asked if he would step aside if his board urged him to do so. 
 ''They wouldn't have to ask me twice,'' he said. 
 It is a remarkable comedown for Mr. Lewis, once celebrated for a run of bold acquisitions that transformed Bank of America from a somewhat sleepy regional player into one of the nation's largest banks. His predecessor, Hugh L. McColl Jr., is revered as ''Mr. Charlotte,'' the man who put Bank of America and this city on the financial map.
 But Mr. Lewis's legacy is far from assured. Some analysts contend he may be remembered as the man who brought this once-mighty bank to its knees with its acquisition of Merrill Lynch, the giant brokerage firm whose gaping losses forced the bank to seek billions more taxpayer dollars. 
 All of this weighs heavily on Charlotte, where Bank of America's presence is ubiquitous. The bank's 871-foot-high headquarters, one of the tallest buildings in the Southeast, is sometimes called the Taj McColl, in reference to the bank's former chief. Nearby, the Carolina Panthers play in Bank of America Stadium. 
 Together, Bank of America and Wachovia employ about 34,000 people here, and most people know someone who works for one of the banks. Indeed, a greater percentage of people in Charlotte work in banking than do people in New York, Los Angeles or Chicago, according to data from Moody'sEconomy.com.
 ''There is a strong sweat equity -- it's almost like a family -- that comes from building these banks,'' Mr. McCrory says. ''And then there is the financial equity. Many people have stayed with their bank stock because it's one of our own.''
 Little wonder, then, that Charlotte seems to have a pit in its stomach these days. In the pubs and coffee shops along Tryon and Trade Streets, people insist Bank of America will pull through, but talk of layoffs is rife. 
 Some wonder if Bank of America will end up like Citigroup, widely regarded as the sickest of the nation's sick banks and, perhaps, a candidate for nationalization. Mr. Lewis and his lieutenants insist their bank is no Citigroup, but that is small comfort to employees who are losing their jobs. 
 At an outplacement firm in a Charlotte suburb, six of the seven people at one recent orientation had lost their jobs at Bank of America. Most of them were middle-aged, and some had worked for the bank for more than a decade. They openly expressed doubts about the future of Bank of America, according to one former bank employee who attended the meeting. 
 ''Morale is awful,'' this person said, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified because he was not authorized by the bank to speak publicly. ''All of us have seen our personal wealth collapse. Do we feel any better than people at Citi? Not really.''
 Back in Charlotte, another worker who had just lost his job gazed wistfully at the store inside the bank's headquarters that sells all sorts of items bearing the Bank of America name and logo, from picnic baskets to children's golf sets to a Bank of America edition of the classic Battleship board game. 
 This person, still stunned by the loss of his job, said that in the past Bank of America seemed to emerge stronger with each successive acquisition. Mr. Lewis's conquests included MBNA, US Trust and FleetBoston. 
 But now, with Merrill Lynch, Bank of America seems like the loser. 
 ''In the other mergers, we always felt comfortable that we're buying them, so we're going to have the jobs,'' this person said. ''This one was different. Everyone's tense. You try to read your boss's mind, you look into his eyes to see if he made eye contact with you. You wonder how the bank can come back with all this fear.''
 Fifty-eight flights up, artwork that Bank of America collected through its long series of mergers adorns the walls. A spokesman points to the paintings as tokens of success. 
 A bank executive, Liam McGee, bounds into a small meeting room. Mr. McGee, the head of consumer banking and considered a possible successor to Mr. Lewis, fires off numbers that he says underscore Bank of America's strength: 6,100 retail branches in 33 states accessible to 82 percent of the nation's population and serving nearly two of three families. 
 ''In today's news environment, where so much talk is about Merrill Lynch, people are forgetting about the strength of our business,'' Mr. McGee says. 
 Even now, Bank of America is pushing ahead with plans to build another glass office tower connected to its headquarters, as well as a Ritz Carlton hotel next door, where it can host board members and visitors. 
 Mr. McColl, arguably Bank of America's most influential individual shareholder, dismisses Wall Street's anxiety over the Merrill deal, which has drawn scrutiny from New York's attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo is investigating whether Mr. Lewis adequately disclosed the risks of the merger to shareholders. Bank of America says he did. 
 ''It's hard to stay calm when people are saying things that are offensive to you,'' Mr. McColl says. 
 Still, Mr. McColl, 73, softens his voice when asked about the pain befalling Charlotte. He says he feels terrible about the wealth that has been lost, and acknowledges that, for good or ill, the future of this city is inextricably linked to that of Bank of America.
 Asked if he continues to support Mr. Lewis, Mr. McColl says he does, and compares pushing out Mr. Lewis to ''changing the quarterback in the middle of the key game.'' He spends a lot of time these days talking with lawmakers and friends like Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who once traveled with him to Russia to go fly-fishing. His message to them, he says, is that Bank of America simply ''needs time.'' 
 But did Mr. Lewis stretch too far? Has he lost credibility with investors? 
 Mr. McColl shakes his head. Like many in Charlotte, he says Bank of America has had many doubters over the years. 
 ''But it never stops us,'' he said, ''and we keep right on going.''

 U.S. ENVOYS REACH OVER A DIVIDE
 To Urge Reconciliation in Pakistan
 The American ambassador to Pakistan and the Obama administration's special envoy reached out to rival leaders there to urge them to reconcile. The move prompted speculation that the American government was trying to ease tension in the area.

 Pope Benedict XVI acknowledged in a letter that the Vatican had made mistakes in its handling of a bishop who denies the Holocaust. The pope said that he had recently been told that information available on the Internet could have helped bring the issue to the Vatican's attention earlier. The Holy See, Benedict wrote, would be paying closer attention to that particular source of news from now on. Page A5

 As wallets get thinner, so does the advertising for big ticket items, particularly when it comes to cars. So American Honda Motor thinks the timing might be right for a more mainstream hybrid. With a ticket price of under $20,000, the Insight might just be what the ad slogans style it as: the people's hybrid. Page B3

 Editorial
 WHILE EVERYONE FIDDLES

 Spraying bullets from military-style, semiautomatic assault rifles, a deranged 28-year-old gunman killed 10 people and wounded 6 others before fatally shooting himself.

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
There is nothing more tantalizing than a chance to peek into a private art collection, especially when it has been secreted in a fortresslike compound in Greenwich, Conn., and when the owner happens to be the hedge-fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen. 
 For the past decade he and his wife, Alexandra, have been among the highest profile consumers in the art world, buying works like Damien Hirst's ''Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living,'' the 14-foot tiger shark submerged in a tank of formaldehyde, for $8 million, and de Kooning's seminal painting ''Woman III,'' which Mr. Cohen bought privately in 2006 from the entertainment magnate David Geffen for a reported $137.5 million. 
 Although Mr. Cohen has lent works to museums occasionally (the shark is on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art), most of his collection has never been publicly exhibited. 
 But next month Sotheby's will show a group of 20 works that the couple have collected over the past decade. The exhibition, from April 2 to 14 in the 10th-floor galleries at the firm's York Avenue headquarters in Manhattan, is a carefully selected group of paintings, sculptures, works on paper and photographs that all depict women. 
 The idea for the theme show arose one recent evening during a dinner at the Cohens' home with William F. Ruprecht, Sotheby's president and chief executive; Tobias Meyer, the auction house's worldwide director of contemporary art; and Lisa Dennison, its chairman in North and South America. Mr. Meyer recalls sitting in the dining room staring at ''Le Repos,'' Picasso's 1932 depiction of his wife Olga (a canvas Mr. Cohen bought at Christie's in 2006 for $34.7 million) while in the background he could see Warhol's 1964 ''Turquoise Marilyn'' hanging over the living-room fireplace. 
 ''It just came to me,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''I suddenly said, 'Why don't we do an exhibition of all the works in your collection that show women?' '' 
 The answer was an instant yes. ''I hadn't really thought about it, and nobody had ever offered,'' Mr. Cohen said in a telephone interview. ''So I was game. It's unlikely a museum would do something like this, and I figured: Why not let the public see the pictures? It's a free exhibition.'' 
 He was quick to add that nothing was for sale. ''This is not a way of selling my pictures,'' Mr. Cohen emphasized. 
 For Sotheby's it makes business sense. ''It helps grow our relationship,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''And it's good for building the brand.'' 
 The exhibition also offers other business advantages: It brings people into the auction house during tough economic times, and it allows Sotheby's to regain the spotlight after Christie's coup in Paris last month, when it sold $483.8 million worth of art and objects belonging to Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Berge. 
 The earliest work in the show will be van Gogh's ''Peasant Girl With Yellow Straw Hat'' (1890), which Mr. Cohen bought from the Las Vegas casino owner Stephen A. Wynn in 2005. It also includes two Matisse sculptures, three Picassos paintings, a Modigliani canvas, an early Rauschenberg blueprint and a Lucian Freud painting, along with examples by some of the trendiest contemporary artists, like Richard Prince and Cindy Sherman. 
 Sotheby's plans to publish a catalog with an introduction by Joachim Pissarro, a great-grandson of the artist Camille Pissarro as well as a professor of art history at Hunter College and an adviser to Mr. Cohen. Although the catalog was initially going to be given to top Sotheby's clients only, the house is now considering selling some copies. 
 GOUDSTIKKER REVISITED
 The Jewish Museum's version of the exhibition ''Reclaimed'' will feature 12 works not included when the show was at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Conn., last year. The show consists of paintings from the collection of Jacques Goudstikker, a Dutch dealer who fled Amsterdam during World War II and died in an accident shortly after. It opens at the Jewish Museum on Sunday and runs through Aug. 2. 
 Goudstikker, his wife and their son escaped from the Netherlands on May 14, 1940, leaving behind about 1,400 works, which were looted by the Nazis. About 200 were returned to Goudstikker's heirs by the Dutch government in 2006 in one of the largest restitutions of art seized by the Nazis. 
 ''While the core of the show is the same, the biographical information was at the end of the Bruce Museum's show, and here it will be interspersed throughout the galleries,'' said Karen Levitov, associate curator at the Jewish Museum. ''In this way viewers will see the narrative of Goudstikker's life unfolding.'' 
 In addition to paintings by Jan Steen, Salomon van Ruysdael and Ferdinand Bol, the show will feature works by Hans Memling, Filipino Lippi and Jan van Goyen that have never been shown in the United States. 
 There will also be a text panel explaining how experts identified the works. The back of one painting, with a red seal from the original gallery, will also be on display. ''It was originally thought to be by Berthe Morisot,'' Ms. Levitov said. ''But it has since been reattributed to an anonymous artist. This painting was not restituted but rather hidden by Goudstikker's assistants during the war and presented to his widow when she returned to Amsterdam.'' 
 The show will include 20 original documents and photographs relating to Goudstikker's life, including a notebook inventorying more than 1,000 of his holdings, a document Goudstikker is thought to have typed in anticipation of his escape from the Nazis. The museum has digitized the notebook, allowing viewers to turn pages with a touch of the screen. ''The images from the show will be embedded in the digital notebook,'' Ms. Levitov said. ''So when visitors click on the entry, the image will instantly appear on the screen.'' 
 The show will travel to the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Fla., and the Contemporary Jewish Museum of San Francisco. 
 INDO-PACIFIC ART AT YALE
 The Yale University Art Gallery announced this week that it would add a curatorial department devoted to Indo-Pacific art. The initiative is the brainchild of Thomas Jaffe, a Yale alumnus and collector who is giving the university about 500 examples of Southeast Asian tribal sculpture from his collection. He also recently bought for Yale a collection of Indonesian textiles put together by two experts in the field, Jeff Holmgren and Anita Spertus. In addition Hunter and Valerie Thompson, collectors from Toronto, have donated their collection of Javanese gold jewelry and sculpture to the university. 
 Word of Mr. Jaffe's plan to donate the sculptures first surfaced last fall. That was around the same time that an inheritance battle over his mother's estate made headlines, leaving in limbo a separate collection of New Guinea tribal art assembled by his half brother John Friede. 
 The new Indo-Pacific department will mean the creation of a curatorial position. Ruth Barnes, textile curator in the department of Eastern Art at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, England, will join the faculty, first as a consultant in April and full time in 2010. And a new gallery devoted to Indo-Pacific art is scheduled to open around 2012, once the three buildings that house all of the Yale University Art Gallery are renovated. 
 ''This is a significant gift,'' said Jock Reynolds, director of the Yale University Art Gallery. ''It will be unlike any department of its kind and will make us one of the country's leaders in the field.'' Although the new gallery won't openfor years, Mr. Reynolds said the collections will be used right away for teaching purposes.

HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students consider how the current recession might affect their generation, and conduct interviews and research to discover how historical, cultural and economic events shape generations. 

 BODY:
Overview: In this lesson, students consider how the current recession might affect their generation, and conduct interviews and research to discover how historical, cultural and economic events shape generations. (Click here for a companion lesson for Grades 3-5.)
Author(s):
Amanda Christy Brown, The New York Times Learning Network

Suggested Time Allowance: 3-5 class periods.
Resources / Materials:
-chart paper
-computers with Internet access or copies of selected articles in Additional Resources, below
Activities / Procedures:
Click here for a companion lesson for Grades 3-5.
1. Warm-Up/Do-Now:
Hand out the quiz "Talkin' 'Bout My Generation" and ask students to complete it.
Once students have finished, share responses. Tell the students that what this quiz is attempting to do is define their generation. Ask: What is a generation? Which generation are you a part of? If students do not know, you might send them out to find out or, if you have the technological resources at hand, do a quick Internet search together. You may find this generation referred to as "the millennial generation," "Generation Y" (an allusion to the generation following "Generation X") "the Net Generation" etc.
Next, ask the following questions: Which name does the class prefer for this generation, and why? To what do the various names refer? What have you heard in the media about your generation? What defines your generation? How is your generation significantly different from that of your parents or grandparents? (Here, make sure that students try to distinguish between what impressions they have of their parents and grandparents as adults per se and the impressions they have of their generations. If they are stumped, let them know that they will now investigate this further by reading a New York Times article and doing a project.)
Before proceeding, you may wish to share a timeline of generations through time, such as TimePage's Generations of American History, focusing on the last two "cycles." This will provide background for thinking about the "Silent Generation," "Baby Boomers" and "Generation X" as well as about their own generation. (This timeline draws on the work of Strauss and Howe, who are cited in the article.)
2. ARTICLE QUESTIONS:
As a class, read and discuss the article "Generation OMG", focusing on the following questions:
a. How did Time magazine describe the Silent Generation in its 1951 exploration?
b. How, did they argue, did the Great Depression shape this generation into being?
c. For what purpose does the author introduce the Silent Generation?
d. How do tough economic times challenge "the whole idea of the American Dream'?
e. Describe how the Great Depression affected people differently, depending on where on the continuum of the Silent Generation they fell.
f. Why might those most immediately affected today be students in high school and college (in other words, you)?
g. According to the article, how might the recession shape your generation -- both positively and negatively?
h. What does it say that the generation coming of age during the Depression "produced more than a dozen White House chiefs of staff, but not a single president"?
i. In what way are children being raised similarly now to how they were raised during the Great Depression?
j. How is this ironic, given that many of these children are children of Generation Xers?
k. Why do you think the writer capitalizes the phrase "Things That Matter"? What things matter?
l. What hope does looking at the past offer this generation?
3. ACTIVITY:
Tell students that they will be working in groups over the next few days to examine their parents', grandparents' and great-grandparents' generations through the eyes of those who lived them and through the lens of the media. Beginning as a whole class, ask students to brainstorm what they know about their parents', grandparents' and great-grandparents' generations. (Generally speaking, these folks will run the gamut from the "Silent Generation" to the "Baby Boomers" to "Generation Jones" and "Generation X".) Ask them to consider the following:
-National events and leaders
-Social, political and economic changes (including race relations)
-Global events and leaders
-Inventions, innovations, medical and scientific milestones
-Entertainment (music, film, literature, fashion)
-Communication and transportation
-Counterculture (those who defy the mainstream culture of the time)
Once you have lists on the board, divide students into small groups of three or four and ask them to use what they've come up with to craft interview questions to help them better understand each generation. Remind them that good interview questions are open-ended and encourage reflection and story-telling. Their questions should apply to any generation like "What clothes do you remember being fashionable when you were in high school?" Remind them that the quiz they took at the beginning of class offers several models for good questions. Ask each group to record their five best interview questions on a piece of chart paper and post it on the wall.
Once each group has posted its questions, reconvene as a group and select the best questions overall, making sure to represent each category, rewriting as needed. Have students record the class-selected interview questions in their journals. Ask individual students to come up with three people to interview -- ideally, from three different generations. Do require them to interview members of at least two different generations. These need not necessarily be family members; kids could reach out to their larger communities for interview subjects. If students do not have access to the "Silent Generation," suggest that they ask their parents or grandparents what they know about what it was like to grow up during the Great Depression. They should ask each of their interview subjects the same questions they recorded in class. For homework, ask students to conduct interviews, audio or video recording them if at all possible.
Once students return to class with their interviews completed, have them share highlights from their interviews. Next, tell them that they are going to look at what the media has to say about these generations. Regroup students or assign existing groups each to one of the following generations: "Silent," "Boom," "Jones" and "X". Print out or direct students to the Additional Times Resources below. Within each group, ask students to read one article each about their assigned generation. Then, together, the group should fill out the handout "Talkin' 'Bout Their Generation" based on their individual reading. Once groups have finished their research and reading, each group will share how the media portrays their assigned generation.
Following the sharing, ask students, How does what the media have to say about these generations compare with what those people you interviewed who lived them said about them? How do you account for any differences?
Tell students that they will now use what they've learned to create a classroom exhibition called "Portraits of a Generation". Each student will contribute one piece to the exhibition. The goal of the piece is to represent one of the generations studied and complicate what defines it. Give students freedom to present information in whichever way they feel will be most effective. Offer them the following project ideas to help them get started:
-a podcast, including audio clips from one or several of their interviews and commentary
-a video clip / mini-documentary
-an oral history of one of their interview subjects
-a collage of images and/or quotations that represent and complicate the generation
-a curated collection of artifacts from the generation
-a piece of historical fiction, based on facts from interviews and research
-a computer slideshow of images and captions or a photo essay
-graphs or graphics representing demographic information for a particular generation
-a "soundtrack" for the generation
Students will work on their pieces for homework.
Close class with a discussion of the following questions: How do you think you and your peers are being shaped by the times you live in? How are our times similar to and different from the the Great Depression era? How is your generation like the so-called "Silent Generation"? How is it different? What images does the media present of your generation? How accurately do these images reflect who you really are? What will people in the future say about your generation? What do you want them to say? How much power do individuals have to shape a generation? If you could name your generation, what would you call it? Why?
4. FOR HOMEWORK OR FUTURE CLASSES:
Students work on their individual contributions to the class exhibition. In addition to creating the piece, they also write a brief "artist's statement" to accompany it. Their statement should provide a rationale for their artistic decisions.
In a future class, have students install their exhibition and invite people from the larger school community to come and view it. Students might also invite their interview subjects to view the exhibition as part of a celebration of generations and engage them in a discussion of how their generations differ from those of their student interviewers.

1. Create collages of images to represent your generation. Show these collages to your peers and ask them whether or not they feel these truly reflect who they are. Collect quotes and add them to your collage to complicate this portrait of your generation.
2. Look more closely at the role the economy played in defining the generations that followed the "Silent Generation." Did it have as great an impact as it did then? How did it shape lifestyle, attitudes and behavior of members of Generations "Boom," "Jones" and "X"?
3. While the "Silent Generation" was shaped by economic developments in the United States, the Time magazine article also emphasizes the role that wars played in shaping them. How do you think the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will affect your generation?Interdisciplinary Connections:
Civics - Investigate President Obama's Economic Stimulus plan to see what opportunities for service it offers the youth of today. How are these programs similar or different from those offered as part of F.D.R.'s New Deal?
Economics - Read the Times article "Six Decades at the Center of Attention, and Counting". What marketing techniques seem to work for Baby Boomers? How have advertisers changed their techniques as Boomers have aged? Then, choose a product and consider how you might market it differently to the Silent Generation, Boomers, Generation Jones, Generation X, Generation Y and your generation.Academic Content Standards:

Ken Hill's last business trip took him through eight states in January and netted him 12 planes. His current one is a 30- to 45-day trip for 27 more planes, his biggest ever.
Mr. Hill is an airplane repo man, one of the best and busiest in the business. With the economy sinking and the general aviation industry suffering, Mr. Hill is working flat out as he makes his way from one airport to another, carrying just a few basic tools -- a propeller lock, a portable radio, hand-held GPS device and a fanny pack stuffed with hundreds of keys. ''I'm busy, always on the move, up early in the morning, late to bed at night,'' Mr. Hill said in a telephone interview from his hotel in Knoxville, Tenn., between repossessions in January. ''My wife never asks me where I'm going. She just says, 'Call me when you're there, and tell me where you are.' ''
A career plane dealer and licensed pilot, Mr. Hill, 66, estimates that he has repossessed hundreds of aircraft since his first propeller-powered Piper Cherokee 180 in 1969. Friends call him the Grim Reaper, an image he seems to alternately relish and detest.
Whether times are good or bad, the costs of owning a plane are considerable. 
Besides the purchase price, there are maintenance, hangar, fuel, catering and insurance costs. Many owners help pay the bills by chartering their airplanes, but demand is shrinking in this economy.
''You cannot own an airplane without it costing money, whether you're using it or not,'' said Terence Haglund, an aviation lawyer based in Williamsburg, Va., who uses Mr. Hill's services.
Mr. Hill, who lives in Santa Barbara, Calif., said he typically repossessed about 30 planes a year, ranging from propeller-powered Piper trainers to twin-engine Gulfstream business jets. Last year, he brought in 50 aircraft. This year, ''it could be 100,'' he said.
Among his clients, primarily banks that specialize in aircraft loans, Mr. Hill has a reputation for always finding his plane.
''We use Ken because he's full of integrity and he's a cooperative kind of guy,'' said Joseph J. Dini, senior vice president of the aircraft loans group with Sovereign Bank, one of Mr. Hill's top clients. ''He's performing a service for financial institutions that requires a certain amount of delicateness.''
Although Mr. Hill has a small staff, he says he does all the research, tracking, tracing, repossessing and flying himself, and hires others to perform on-site tasks like repairs.
Given the burdensome costs of storing and maintaining seized airplanes, banks are loath to call on the repo man. By the time Mr. Hill gets involved, a borrower is typically 60 days behind on payments.
Jeff Buhr, senior vice president, credit and loan administration manager with the specialty finance group of 1st Source Bank, which is based in South Bend, Ind., and occasionally uses Mr. Hill's services, said that most of the time, borrowers realized that they were in trouble and that their best option was to surrender the aircraft.
But Mr. Dini said many borrowers with debt troubles ''will default on other loans first.'' He added, ''They think, 'Things will turn around, things will get better, why give up the airplane?' ''
For Mr. Hill, the job can be as simple as showing up, talking to the owner and flying the plane away. One borrower even cleaned the windshield and offered Mr. Hill a home-cooked meal before he took the repossessed plane.
But in many other cases, owners do not return calls, do not acknowledge letters and, sometimes, disconnect their phone lines, Mr. Hill said. ''I have to find out where the plane is,'' he said. ''Sometimes that's not easy.''
He starts by tracking the movements of the planes he seeks to repossess. The public site FlightAware.com tracks flights and locations of planes that have filed flight plans with the Federal Aviation Administration. Mr. Hill also uses other, costly databases that he would not identify but, he said, ''give you more capability'' to track planes that have not filed their whereabouts with the F.A.A.
He will also call airport service centers. ''If somebody has plane problems, they have fuel problems, and I can track planes by where they're buying fuel,'' Mr. Hill said. ''You start piecing it together. Sometimes it takes a couple of months.''
After zeroing in on his target, Mr. Hill said, he arrives at the airport and tries to reach the owner. About one in four defaulters agree to make payments current, he said. In such instances, Mr. Hill leaves empty-handed and charges his clients only out-of-pocket expenses for his efforts.
Mr. Hill said he must have free and clear access before he can start the repossession. That can take days and may even require a court order if the owner or the service center does not cooperate.
If he is granted access or if the plane is parked outdoors, Mr. Hill first secures his cable lock around the propeller or the landing gear on a jet. (He usually carries one lock at a time, buying replacements along the way.) Then he tapes a notice of repossession from the lender to the door of the plane. In his fanny pack, he can usually find a master key that opens the plane door. If not, he calls a local locksmith.
Once inside, he will take photographs and do an inventory of the plane's equipment for the bank. If any communications devices are missing, that is where his portable radio and GPS device come in handy -- so that he can safely fly the plane. No hot-wiring is involved, he said, and usually the only key required is the one to open the door.
Mr. Hill's goal is to move the plane out of state, often to a service center in Greenwood, Miss., that he has used for years, to avert any problems with local authorities and associated costs. ''You try to avoid getting it into the legal system,'' he said.
But he will not fly off, he said, until the plane has a clean bill of health from a mechanic, a process that is more complicated if the logbooks cannot be found. Mr. Hill emphasized that he did not jump into planes after dark and fly away. ''I'll do a thorough preflight inspection and make sure there are blue skies all the way,'' he said. ''I won't expose the bank to more problems than it has.''
Once the plane is airworthy and secure, Mr. Hill will have it appraised, check with the F.A.A. for outstanding liens and sell it for the bank. On any given day in recent weeks, he has had at least a dozen planes advertised on his Web site.
Mr. Hill would not disclose any financial details, but he said repossession is not a lucrative career. (He did, however, say it is more interesting than his a somewhat similar sideline career as a registered bounty hunter in California.) Nor does his day always run smoothly.
''I once had a lady chase me through a hangar with a yard rake,'' he said. ''I just tell them, 'I have a job to do.' If they did what they were supposed to do, I wouldn't be here.''

HEADLINE: In This Recession, More Men Are Losing Jobs

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
WHEN the American economy began to slow two years ago, it was women who were in more danger of losing jobs. Men, particularly those who were well educated and in the prime of their career, were more likely to remain employed.
That has now changed, with a vengeance. In the 12 months through February, the latest data available, unemployment rates for men rose at a faster pace than those for women, no matter what their education or age. 
It has simply been harder for men to hold onto their jobs.
A year ago, in February 2008, men who had gone to college but did not earn a bachelor's degree had an unemployment rate of 4.1 percent, below the national rate of 4.5 percent.
But by this February, the rate for that group had more than doubled to 8.9 percent and was well above the national rate of 8.1 percent.
For women with the same education, the rate a year ago was an identical 4.1 percent. That figure has also risen, but only to 6.3 percent.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates the figures based on a household survey, does not provide seasonal adjustments for the unemployment rates for those groups. As a result, comparing changes over periods of less than a year is subject to seasonal distortions.
The unemployment rates for college-educated men and women are still relatively low, but both are rising. Over the 12 months, the unemployment rate of men with college degrees rose to 4.1 percent, from 2 percent; the figure for educated women went from 2.1 percent to 3.9 percent.
Looking at worker ages also shows a disturbing picture for men in what has been the prime of their careers. Men aged 35 to 44, and those aged 45 to 54, had unemployment rates below the national average a year ago. Now their rates, of 8.5 percent and 8.7 percent, are above the national average. The comparable rates for women are 6.4 percent and 5.7 percent.
In February 2007, the national unemployment rate was 4.5 percent, just a tick above the low for the cycle of 4.4 percent, which was last reached in March 2007. The gain over the next year was a slow one, to 4.8 percent, with women tending to do a little worse than men in terms of rising unemployment rates.
Over all, the unemployment rate for women of 25 and older was 6.2 percent in February 2009, while that for men was 9 percent. That difference, of 2.8 percentage points, was the largest since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began compiling the numbers in 1948.
Before this year, the largest difference for any month had been 1.9 percentage points, recorded in February 1983, during another severe recession. In January of this year, the difference was 2.3 percentage points.
Before the 1980s, recessions did not appear to hurt male workers more than female workers. But since then, employment downturns have generally been worse for men, at least in the later months.
The unemployment rate for men, who are more likely to have outside jobs, tends to rise during the cold weather months. So the fact that the February figures are particularly bad for men is partly due to seasonal factors.
But the recent trend is nonetheless clear. On a year-over-year basis, the relative performance of men became significantly worse in September, when the economy began to weaken drastically, and has stayed that way in every successive month.

PERSON: David G. Taylor 

HEADLINE: David G. Taylor, 79, Banker; Helped Engineer a Bailout

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
David G. Taylor, who for six months in 1984 led one of the nation's largest banks with a steady hand as it faced collapse and who helped negotiate what was then the biggest federal bailout of a financial institution, died Feb. 23 at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He was 79.
The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, his brother-in-law, Phillip McCarthy, said. 
Mr. Taylor was chairman and chief executive of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company, in Chicago, from February to July 1984. As a stipulation of the $7.5 billion rescue arranged by the Treasury Department, Mr. Taylor had to step down.
But as Time magazine said a month later, ''Analysts have credited Mr. Taylor, who was not responsible for Continental's problems, with playing an important role in keeping the bank afloat.''
At the time, Continental was the nation's eighth-largest bank. Founded in 1847, it had long been considered a conservative, well-managed bank. But Continental undermined itself with aggressive lending policies.
Its difficulties first emerged in 1982 with losses from loans to the oil and gas industry, and particularly from the collapse of Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City. Penn Square had originated and sold more than $1 billion in energy-related loans to Continental. Most of those loans had to be written off.
Because Illinois law at the time allowed practically no branch banking, Continental was also forced to rely on large, volatile deposits from major investors. That dependence began to backfire as the economy slumped in the early '80s. When the Penn Square losses became public, money managers suddenly withdrew billions of dollars from Continental Illinois.
Fearing a domino effect throughout the industry, the federal government injected Continental with $2 billion and arranged for 28 leading banks to open a $5.5 billion line of credit for it.
''We will make sure that there are no calamities in the banking system,'' Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan said.
Mr. Taylor, who was at the center of the negotiations with the government, had been Continental's executive vice president in charge of raising funds through bond and money markets when he was named chairman. He had not played a role in the loan debacle. Before the government stepped in, Mr. Taylor hired Goldman Sachs to search for a major bank to buy Continental, but no buyers emerged. Still, in his public appearances in those tumultuous days, Mr. Taylor presented a calm demeanor. Continental survived and, in 1994, was acquired by BankAmerica.
David George Taylor was born in Charlevoix, Mich., July 29, 1929, one of four children of Frank and Bessie Taylor. His father was also once head of the bond department at Continental.
After graduating from Denison University with a degree in economics, Mr. Taylor served in the Navy from 1953-56. In 1957, Mr. Taylor was hired as a trainee by Continental. He earned a master's degree in business administration from Northwestern University in 1963 and, by 1974, was executive vice president and head of bond and money market services.
Mr. Taylor's first two marriages, to Carol Rogers and Kit Alexander, ended in divorce. In 1990, he married Robyne McCarthy. Besides his wife, he is survived by two children from his first marriage, a son, David, and a daughter, Amy Brown.
When Mr. Taylor had to step down in 1984, along with other Continental executives, he was replaced by John E. Swearingen, former chairman of the Standard Oil Company (Indiana). Mr. Taylor became vice chairman.
Two years later, when Mr. Taylor left Continental to become vice chairman of the Irving Trust Company in New York, a bank analyst told The New York Times, ''He kept the wolf away from the door for a number of months.''

HEADLINE: The Bigger Apple

BYLINE: By CHARLES J. URSTADT

 BODY:
''THEY'RE not making any new land'' goes the adage, but that's exactly what New Yorkers have been doing for 400 years. After all, Manhattan has grown by at least a few thousand acres since the early Dutch explorers first set foot on the island.
Continuing that great tradition of land expansion is now the key to our economic recovery. By reclaiming thousands of new acres for Manhattan from the waters and smaller islands around us, we could provide unmatched opportunities for commercial, residential and recreational development. And we could do it all without using any government subsidies or bailout money. 
Here are five ways to make Manhattan grow:
1. Develop Governors Island, the 172-acre gem of land lying right at Manhattan's doorstep, for commercial use. The city and state have spent millions turning it into a tourist attraction, but because of budget cuts, the island may not have enough money to reopen this summer.
It was always a mistake to make Governors Island just a day-trip destination when it should be built into a real neighborhood for New Yorkers, with apartments, retail spaces and schools. The success of Battery Park City shows that this can be done without government money: building owners would pay ground rent and payments in lieu of taxes (known as Pilot payments) to an organization not unlike the Battery Park City Authority, which would then deduct operating costs and pay the ''profits'' to the city.
One longstanding argument against private and commercial development of Governors Island has been its inaccessibility. It was selected as a gun emplacement to guard New York Harbor for this very reason. But access to the island could be achieved by building an aerial tram like the one to Roosevelt Island, by running a ramp off the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel or by simply increasing ferry service.
After all, it was ferry service that brought New Yorkers to Staten Island, an area that by all rights should be associated with nearby New Jersey.
2. Tear down Pier A, the crumbling wooden relic in Battery Park City at the very entrance to New York Harbor. There is some talk of wasting $30 million to upgrade this eyesore, but it serves no purpose and -- except for the clock tower erected after World War I as a memorial to fallen soldiers -- it has no historical significance. Better to replace the pier with a five-acre quay similar to the Circular Quay in Sydney. A quay could serve as a central ferry terminal, which would pay for itself with fees paid by the ferry boat operators. And the historical clock tower could be properly preserved and incorporated into the new quay.
3. The South Cove of Battery Park City, a few blocks north of Pier A, offers an opportunity to add two acres to Manhattan. In 1969, when I was the chief executive of the Battery Park City Authority, I reluctantly consented to creating this cove. City planners thought it would be a good thing to interrupt our continuous bulkhead and waterside promenade.
But thanks to tidal currents and prevailing winds from the west, however, the cove has never been more than a garbage accumulator. Just take a walk down there, and you'll see all the waste floating in.
By simply extending the existing bulkhead, eliminating the cove and filling it with sand -- as we did to create the rest of Battery Park City -- we would have the base for an iconic building that, teamed with the Statue of Liberty to the west, could serve as a welcoming beacon for the best-known city and natural harbor in the world. Perhaps it could be the product of an international design competition.
Again, ground rents and Pilot payments would more than pay for the bulkhead and landfill with no expenditure of taxpayer money -- and a monumental building on that new land could also produce a substantial profit for the city. Keeping in mind the value of similar waterfront land and office use, I estimate that one million square feet on those two new acres could yield at least $25 million a year.
4. Develop 50 more acres of landfill in the Hudson River on the West Side, north of Battery Park City. The cost of the landfill, as well as of the public park and recreational spaces that would be part of the new area, could be reimbursed from ground rents and Pilot payments collected from private developers. I have been advocating this additional landfill project for some time and have been faced with the bogus argument that it would kill the fish.
But fish actually prefer the nooks and crannies of the rock formations surrounding Battery Park City's north marina to the murky silt that was under the rotting piers that we removed to develop the area. The building of a new bulkhead would use large rocks to shore up the concrete wall and between these rocks fish could lay eggs. (And to my knowledge, not a single fish was killed as we filled the original 92 acres of Battery Park City.)
5. Fill in the Harlem River, which separates Manhattan and the Bronx. The Harlem River did not become a navigable waterway until 1895, when the Army Corps of Engineers dredged a shipping canal that provided direct passage for vessels from the East River to the Hudson. Nineteen years later, the creek that had served as the northern boundary of Manhattan was filled in, leaving the neighborhood of Marble Hill, still technically part of Manhattan, physically attached to the Bronx.
So if we were to drain the Harlem River, we would actually restore the land to its original state. We could start by damming it at each end, using fill from local excavations and from dredging operations to clear silt from the Hudson and East Rivers. (Contractors would provide the fill and they'd pay to dump so close to home, which would help finance the project. It's a double win.) Once the dams were in place, the channel would slowly dry up and eventually the entire area would have some 3,000 acres that could be used for parks, schools, businesses and homes.
Yes, it could take decades to turn the little-used Harlem River into thriving neighborhoods -- but time did not deter the Dutch from their initial landfill efforts, nor did it deter those of us who built Battery Park City. To ignore today's opportunities would leave Manhattan lagging behind other forward-looking places like Dubai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and the Netherlands, all of which have reclaimed land from the waters around them.
As we've done for centuries, let's continue to grow this city -- literally -- and keep Manhattan ''the island in the center of the world.''

HEADLINE: For Him, the Political Has Always Been Comical

BYLINE: By BRUCE HEADLAM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In 1968 Dick Gregory tried out a new line: Say there's this skinny black guy from Chicago who runs for president of the United States.
Wait for it.
Forty-one years later Mr. Gregory, comedian, civil rights activist, health-food advocate and an early black candidate for president, spent Inauguration Day with the crowds in Washington, where he keeps an apartment.
''A beautiful day,'' he said. ''The crowds just pouring in, and no signs to tell them where to go. They just knew.''
About a month later Mr. Gregory was sipping tea in the lobby bar of the Capital Hilton hotel in Washington, where he likes to greet out-of-towners. As is the case with much of the country, however, his inaugural bliss had faded, along with his hopes for the Obama honeymoon. 
''This economy can't be fixed in two years,'' he said with a sigh. ''And the last guy with the gun gets blamed for the crime.''
At 76, Mr. Gregory has regained the half-miler's build that got him a scholarship at Southern Illinois University, although the dark hair and Clark Gable mustache from his performing days have settled into a white halo around his face. When not here or at his home in Plymouth, Mass., where he lives with Lily, his wife of 50 years, he is on the road doing around 200 shows a year, including four this week at Carolines in New York. (The run concludes on Sunday night.)
The pace might surprise white audiences, who remember Mr. Gregory better as an influence -- Bill Cosby inherited his stage presence, Richard Pryor his racial candor -- than as a player in his own right. But during the golden era of skinny-tie comedians, he was one of the biggest: a $12,000-a-week headliner on a par with Mort Sahl, Lenny Bruce and Woody Allen.
''The respect for Dick is not as huge as it ought to be,'' said Mr. Cosby, who was coming up as a comedian at around the same time. ''You just couldn't argue with his incredible sense of the future, and his drive.''
Mr. Gregory was a headliner in Las Vegas when the casinos were still largely segregated, played all the hot clubs in New York and San Francisco, published a best-selling autobiography and became the first black guest invited to the sofa on Jack Paar's show, where he startled audiences by mixing obligatory family jokes with sharp political humor.
The initial shock was as much about manner as about subject. Previously, blacks playing white rooms would sprinkle jokes between dancing or singing routines. Mr. Gregory was, in his words, ''the first flatfooter'' -- no dancing, no shuffling -- to play white clubs. Wearing a white shirt and three-button Brooks Brothers suit, he balanced himself on a stool and talked in rolling sentences, punctuating his routine with long pauses as he slowly dragged on his cigarette.
''He would find a white waiter and say, 'Bring me a Scotch and water,' and there would be this palpable gasp from the crowd,'' said Robert Lipsyte, a former New York Times reporter who helped write Mr. Gregory's 1964 autobiography, ''Nigger.''
''They'd watch as the waiter brought him the drink. He'd take a sip and then say, 'Governor Faubus should see me now' '' -- a reference to the Arkansas governor who in 1957 opposed the integration of the Little Rock schools. ''He won over the whole audience. They were suddenly liberal again.''
But while Mr. Gregory talked politics, he wasn't a political comic. If anything, he had an antipolitical genius for personalizing -- and then disarming -- relations between races:
''I sat in six months once at a Southern lunch counter. When they finally served me, they didn't have what I wanted.''
''Down South they don't care how close I am as long as I don't get too big, and up North they don't care how big I am as long as I don't get too close.''
''Don't just sit there and heckle me. Pay your check, burn your cross, and leave.''
Mr. Gregory had an almost inexhaustible amount of material, training from his early days as an M.C. for black audiences at blues clubs in St. Louis and Chicago for three hours a night. To feed his act he spent hours before shows stripping articles out of newspapers and magazines, a habit he has never broken. During the interview in Washington he produced a canvas shopping bag full of carefully highlighted clips from London papers, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.
''I buy about $1,500 worth of papers every month,'' he said. ''Not that I trust them. I'm looking for the crack in the fabric.''
He's still finding cracks. In the hotel bar he spoke in long riffs about civil rights, the stimulus package, car ownership during the Depression, the Kerner Commission report on the race riots of the 1960s, Mark Twain, the shortage of shoe repairmen, his old college mate Roland Burris, his anger at black leaders (including former friends) who failed to support Barack Obama (''What did people see in you that you can't see in him?'') and his offense at the N-word -- not the word itself, the one a self-conscious white visitor could not bring himself to say, but the very phrase ''the N-word.''
But mainly he wanted to talk about the economy, which he describes in almost apocalyptic, if comic, terms. ''After three hundred years of white privilege, there's an anger there that black folk don't see,'' he said. ''Being white is a job in America. You take that away, you better get the soldiers out.''
Mr. Sahl once said that Mr. Gregory ''has one joke: the back of the bus.'' Even granting him the hostility that typically exists between comedians, Mr. Sahl's comment is especially cruel -- not just because of how long the trip from the back of the bus was, but also because Mr. Gregory, unlike many comics of the day, really did sit in at lunch counters.
He was friends with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Medgar Evers and Malcolm X, delivered food to N.A.A.C.P. offices in the South, marched in Selma, Ala., and was threatened many times and arrested more than once.
Ed Weinberger, who was later a producer of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ''The Cosby Show,'' worked as a writer for Mr. Gregory for three years, often accompanying him on his trips to the South. He remembers him spending ''hours on the phone, gathering information, finding out what was happening.''
Once, Mr. Weinberger recalled, when they were both fleeing an angry crowd, Mr. Gregory heard someone yell, ''Get the nigger lover.'' He turned to Mr. Weinberger and said: ''Let's separate. I think they're after you.''
But he wouldn't preach politics during his act. ''If I was marchin', and they were laughin' at me, I'd be defeated,'' he told Gerald Nachman, the author of ''Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s.'' But his civil rights work kept him from the stage. ''You could see the bookings drying up,'' Mr. Lipsyte said.
Mr. Gregory ran for president in 1968, after an unsuccessful bid to be mayor of Chicago. His candidacy was a stunt, but it was not a joke: Mr. Cosby remembered that there were many people, particularly in Chicago, who worked hard for the campaign. On Election Day he received about 47,000 votes -- not bad until you consider the competition.
In the years after, his career took on the peripatetic restlessness of an ex-president's. He hit the health-food speaking circuit, pushing a raw food diet and something he called the Bahamian Diet Nutritional Drink; wrote alternative-history books; tried to intervene in the Iranian hostage crisis; and enjoyed an odd revival with his public campaign to help Walter Hudson, a 1,200-pound man, lose weight. Not Habitat for Humanity, perhaps, but not the Carlyle Group, either.
And he kept performing. Like Lenny Bruce, Mr. Gregory is a paranoid; like Mort Sahl, he is a conspiracy theorist. But while his tendencies fed his comedy, they didn't overwhelm it. And as Mr. Lipsyte pointed out, he had good reason to be paranoid: he really could hear clicks on his phone during the civil rights era.
Mr. Weinberger said that Mr. Gregory ''always felt there was another side to government that wasn't being revealed, a darker side.'' And, he added, ''That didn't start with the Kennedy assassination.''
That side of Mr. Gregory hasn't gone away either. But while the economic meltdown may be grist for more dark theories, for Mr. Gregory there's always a bright side: the chance for some new material.
In Washington he talked about a seminar he had held recently with students at a black college. ''They said they can't get ahead because the playing field ain't level,'' he said with the smile of a prophet who has finally seen his predictions come to pass. ''Well, it's about to get level now.''

HEADLINE: For 'Dreamgirls,' Pacific Overtures

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN. 
Patrick Healy contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- Several months ago, when John F. Breglio told fellow New York producers that he was not only remaking ''Dreamgirls,'' the 1981 Broadway hit musical based loosely on the career of the Supremes, but that he was also going to South Korea to do it, they were puzzled, to say the least.
''Then they really laugh,'' he said, when he told them ''that it's in Korean with Korean actors.''
Mr. Breglio, the executor of the estate of Michael Bennett (who directed and choreographed ''Dreamgirls'' and ''A Chorus Line,'' among others), calls his venture an experiment. His $6.7 million ''Dreamgirls'' opened to a packed theater here on Feb. 27 and has drawn good reviews. 
What Mr. Breglio's company, Vienna Waits Productions, is doing with its South Korean partner, Shin Chun Soo, the president of the OD Musical Company in Seoul, is unusual for American theater producers, some of whom said they were skeptical that elements of a Korean production would transfer smoothly to an American stage. Nevertheless, Mr. Breglio plans to open the show, with a new American cast, at the Apollo Theater in Harlem in November.
Mr. Shin, representative of South Korea's new, voracious appetite for musical theater, bankrolled the production: royalties for American artists, a local cast, costumes and a $1.5 million set.
The financial incentives for Mr. Breglio to go to South Korea were significant, coming as many Broadway producers are struggling to cover production costs. The fact that the set was made and financed here, and will be transferred to the United States for the run there, is a big savings for the American producers.
The South Korean side is also covering the lion's share of the entire tryout costs: wages and expenses for the 20-member American creative staff during its stay here (which ran from a month to 10 weeks), the Americans' lodgings and meals, the costs of choreography and stage and costume designs (though the costumes will be remade for American actresses). By the time ''Dreamgirls'' reaches the Apollo, Mr. Breglio said, he will need to have raised only around $5 million, half of what it usually costs to put on a show in the United States. ''This model is more important than ever because there is a real threat right now in the United States to getting these shows done,'' he said in an interview here. ''Even without the crisis, Broadway has gone very expensive.''
Economics are not the only reason for the strategy. In an era when ''the Internet and YouTube does not allow you a great deal of time to develop and make mistakes,'' Robert Longbottom, the director of the production, said, ''coming to Korea was about as far out of town as you could get.''
If this works, other Broadway producers will follow suit, said Jack M. Dalgleish, a New York producer who was not part of the ''Dreamgirls'' crew but helped to facilitate the partnership of Mr. Breglio and Mr. Shin.
''We are looking for new ways to develop musicals,'' he said.
Some longtime Broadway producers remain skeptical of the artistic value of transferring ''Dreamgirls'' -- or any other production, for that matter -- from South Korea to the United States, when the cast and language in Seoul will be different.
The main purpose of out-of-town tryouts is to have time to work with a cast and a creative team to perfect a show, and to fix weak parts of a production, based on audience response. Given that ''Dreamgirls'' will have an American makeover in the United States, the South Korean production seems less about rethinking the out-of-town tryout than about tapping a new market of investors.
''I don't think South Korea represents a trend for Broadway,'' said Emanuel Azenberg, a Broadway producer. ''I think it represents a country where 'Dreamgirls' is happening. We went through this with Japan before -- American shows had to go to Japan at some point. But I don't know what you really gain aesthetically by trying out one version of a show in a foreign country first.''
For South Koreans, though, the arrangement is a matter of pleasure and cultural explorations. Many here are not especially familiar with African-American heritage. But the universal themes of the story -- three young women struggling to escape men's exploitation and make it on their own in show business, the power of sisterhood and redemption -- made the 2006 Hollywood movie adaptation hugely successful in South Korea, a country with a new generation of assertive women moving from the margins of society to the center.
South Korea is a natural place for American producers to look: the country has 180 musicals already running or scheduled to go onstage in the coming weeks. Ticket sales for musicals grew 25 percent last year, according to Interpark, the country's largest online ticket seller. ''Dreamgirls'' was leading the musical rankings this week.
Among the cultural differences the producers had to overcome were the hesitancy and even embarrassment that Korean actresses feel about expressing strong emotions.
''The women are not as confrontational as they are in the United States,'' Mr. Longbottom said. ''Pointing your finger at someone's face and chasing them around the stage and yelling at them was something that didn't come naturally to this group of people.''
Kim So Hyang, who played Lorrell Robinson, one of the three young singers, said she initially felt ''resistant'' to the American director's demand for ''what we Koreans considered overdoing it and exaggerated acting.''
Many Korean actresses hope to perform on Broadway one day. Like the African-American women of ''Dreamgirls,'' who rose from the fringe of show business to stardom, Korean musical performers have only recently begun enjoying a national following after years of being dismissed as crude imitators of a foreign art form.
Hong Ji Min, who plays Effie White, the show's full-figured, gospel-voiced lead singer, said she struggled to render the deep vocal flavor of the character.
But working with the composer, Henry Krieger, whom the actresses called Grandpa, was their own dream come true.
''We cry after each show,'' Ms. Hong said. ''This has a story that feels so close to our heart. It's about the show business. It's about having a dream.''

HEADLINE: High Noon On the Set: Cramer Vs. Stewart

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
It wasn't ''Brawl Street'' or a thrilla in vanilla. It wasn't a ''Daily Show'' friendly feud or even much of a discussion. Mostly, the much-hyped Thursday night showdown between the comedian Jon Stewart and Jim Cramer, the mercurial host of ''Mad Money'' on CNBC, felt like a Senate subcommittee hearing.
Mr. Stewart treated his guest like a C.E.O. subpoenaed to testify before Congress: his point was not to hear Mr. Cramer out, but to act out a cathartic ritual of indignation and castigation. 
''Listen, you knew what the banks were doing, yet were touting it for months and months,'' the Democratic senator from Comedy Central said. ''The entire network was. For now to pretend that this was some sort of crazy, once-in-a-lifetime tsunami that nobody could have seen coming is disingenuous at best and criminal at worst.''
Congress has -- belatedly and showily -- gone after the leaders of banks, auto companies and insurance companies for their complicity in the financial crisis. Mr. Stewart has always had a messianic streak to his political satire, as when he ripped into Tucker Carlson and Paul Begala on ''Crossfire'' for ''hurting America.'' He is now focusing on business news cable networks like CNBC, which not only failed to foresee the credit crisis, but also, in his view, sided with the bankers and helped inflate the bubble.
And while it's never much fun to watch a comedian lose his sense of humor, in an economic crisis it's even sadder to see supposed financial clairvoyants acting like clowns.
Mr. Stewart made his feelings clear. ''I understand you want to make finance entertaining,'' he told Mr. Cramer. ''But it's not a game,'' he said, using an additional adjective that was bleeped out. ''When I watch that, I can't tell you how angry that makes me.''
Part of Mr. Stewart's frustration may stem from the fact that while he clearly won the debate, Mr. Cramer and CNBC stood to profit from the encounter. In today's television news market, that cable network and its stars are like the financiers they cover: media short-sellers trading shamelessly on publicity, good or bad, so long as it drives up ratings. There isn't enough regulation on Wall Street, and there's hardly any accountability on cable news: it's a 24-hour star system in which opinions -- and showmanship -- matter more than facts.
Like a Congressional witness who knows better than to contradict senators in public, Mr. Cramer spent much of the interview (and it went long) ruefully conceding that he could have done better, and that he sure will try from now on, but really his heart was in the right place. ''There are shenanigans, and we should call them out, I should do a better job at that,'' Mr. Cramer said, adding that he was lobbying Washington (''I have people in Congress,'' is how he put it ) to tighten regulation and enforcement. ''I'm trying,'' he said.
Mr. Cramer tried to be friendly and looked a little taken aback by Mr. Stewart's prosecutorial tone -- he might have been expecting a more jocular give-and-take. But mostly, he sat back and milked every last drop from a tempest-in-a-cable-box that NBC and its sister channels have been fanning ever since the ''Daily Show'' host began hammering CNBC for its complacent Wall Street coverage, singling out embarrassing market calls by Mr. Cramer in particular.
''The Daily Show'' has shown clip after clip from last year that shows Mr. Cramer assuring his ''Mad Money'' viewers that Bear Stearns was not in trouble -- shortly before that heavily leveraged investment firm imploded. He has apologized to his viewers several times since then. (''I have always thought they were honest,'' he said on Thursday. ''That was my mistake.'')
On Tuesday the ''Today'' show invited Mr. Cramer to reply to Mr. Stewart's charges -- and watch the ''Daily Show'' clips of his show all over again. He also appeared on ''Morning Joe,'' on MSNBC, and on Thursday morning, he made pie crusts with Martha Stewart, whose syndicated show is distributed by NBC, and jokingly thwacked the table with her rolling pin at the mention of Mr. Stewart's name. Mr. Stewart used that clip in his introduction, saying with a smirk, ''Mr. Cramer, don't you destroy enough dough on your own show?''
Once he had Mr. Cramer at his desk, Mr. Stewart showed fresh and even more embarrassing clips from a 2006 interview with the Web site Mr. Cramer founded, TheStreet.com, in which he too candidly explained how hedge fund market manipulation really works.
And Mr. Stewart pointedly questioned the hyped-up theatricality and dubious claims of CNBC shows like ''Mad Money'' and ''Fast Money.'' When Mr. Cramer explained, ''There is a market for it, and you give it to them,'' Mr. Stewart stared at him in disbelief, exclaiming, ''There's a market for cocaine and hookers!''
Mr. Stewart kept getting the last word, but Mr. Cramer may yet have the last laugh.
Correction: April 1, 2009, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture on March 14 with the TV Watch column, about the stock market analyst Jim Cramer's appearance on ''The Daily Show,'' carried an erroneous credit. The picture, of Mr. Cramer and Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' was taken by Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times, not Jason DeCrow/Associated Press.

HEADLINE: CHINA'S PREMIER SEEKS GUARANTEE FROM U.S. ON DEBT

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, KEITH BRADSHER and MARK LANDLER; Michael Wines reported from Beijing, Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong, and Mark Landler from Washington.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, spoke in unusually blunt terms on Friday about the ''safety'' of China's $1 trillion investment in American government debt, the world's largest such holding, and urged the Obama administration to offer assurances that the securities would maintain their value.
Speaking ahead of a meeting of finance ministers and bankers this weekend near London to lay the groundwork for next month's Group of 20 summit meeting of the nations with the 20 largest economies, Mr. Wen said that he was ''worried'' about China's holdings of United States Treasury bonds and other debt, and that China was watching economic developments in the United States closely.
As the financial crisis has unfolded, China has become increasingly vocal about what it perceives as Washington's mismanagement of the global economy and financial system, joining a chorus of foreign critics of unbridled American capitalism. On Thursday, for example, France and Germany rebuffed American calls to coordinate a global stimulus package at the G-20 meeting, saying financial regulation should come first. 
In January, Mr. Wen gave a speech criticizing what he called an ''unsustainable model of development characterized by prolonged low savings and high consumption.'' There was little doubt that he was referring to the United States.
Mr. Wen sounded similar themes in his remarks on Friday, which came in response to questions at a news conference at the end of the Chinese Parliament's annual session. While refraining from direct criticism of the Obama administration's economic policies, he reminded Washington of China's status as its largest creditor. With budget deficits mounting rapidly, the United States needs China if it is to finance all that new debt at low interest rates.
''President Obama and his new government have adopted a series of measures to deal with the financial crisis. We have expectations as to the effects of these measures,'' Mr. Wen said. ''We have lent a huge amount of money to the U.S. Of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets. To be honest, I am definitely a little worried.''
He called on the United States to ''maintain its good credit, to honor its promises and to guarantee the safety of China's assets.'' What he did not mention was that Chinese investments in the United States helped drive the debt-fueled boom of the last decade, during which China grew increasingly dependent on the American market -- a point that was driven home earlier this week when China reported a record 26 percent drop in exports in February.
He stopped short of any threat to reduce purchases of American bonds, much less sell any of them, underscoring the two countries' mutual dependency.
Some specialists say that China's investment in American debt is now so vast that it would be impossible for Beijing to unload its Treasury securities without flooding the market and driving down their price.
Still, it is rare for any world leader to raise questions about the safety of United States Treasuries. Both the White House and Treasury Department issued reassuring statements. Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said, ''There's no safer investment in the world than in the United States.'' Foreign investors would be reassured if Congress adopted the president's budget plan, he said, because it would put ''us on that path to fiscal responsibility.''
While economists dismiss the possibility of the United States defaulting on its obligations, they say China could face steep losses in the event of a sharp rise in United States interest rates or a plunge in the value of the dollar.
Mr. Wen praised China's comparatively healthy economy and said his government would take whatever steps were needed to end the country's slump. He also predicted that the world economy would improve in 2010.
His remarks appeared to have little immediate effect on financial markets. Many China experts said Mr. Wen appeared to be speaking as much to a domestic audience as to the United States. Other analysts interpreted Mr. Wen's comments simply as a sign of irritation that the Obama administration had paid little attention to China in the planning for the G-20 conference. At the last such meeting in November, China's president, Hu Jintao, spoke about the importance of listening to the voices of major developing economies in reforming the international financial system.
''The Chinese are peeved, legitimately, that the Americans have ignored them in the run-up to the G-20,'' said Adam S. Posen, the deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. There may also be a bit of tit-for-tat for Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner's claim, in written Senate testimony, that China manipulated its currency, keeping it artificially low against the dollar.
Mr. Wen's confident performance also underscored the growing financial and geopolitical importance of China, one of the few countries to retain enormous spending power despite slowing growth. It has the world's largest reserves of foreign exchange, estimated at $2 trillion, the product of years of double-digit growth.
Economists say at least half of that money has been invested in United States Treasury notes and other government-backed debt, mostly bonds issued by the Treasury and government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Much of the Treasury debt China purchased in recent years carries a low interest rate and would plunge in value if interest rates were to rise sharply in the United States. Some financial experts have warned that measures taken to combat the financial crisis -- running large budget deficits and expanding the money supply -- may eventually lead to higher interest rates.
''The United States government is going to have to sell a huge amount of paper, and the market may react by demanding a higher interest rate,'' said Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert in the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''This will force down the price of outstanding treasuries, imposing large paper losses on the Chinese.''
The conflicting financial currents pose a dilemma for Beijing. The smaller the United States stimulus, the less its borrowing, which could help prevent interest rates from rising. But less government spending in the United States could also mean a slower recovery for the American economy and reduced American demand for Chinese goods.
The sharp narrowing of China's trade surplus with the United States may result in reduced Chinese purchases of American bonds in any case. By some accounts, China's trade surplus could fall by as much as half this year, to around $155 billion. That would leave China with fewer dollars to buy foreign bonds, particularly as the pace of investment flows into China has also slowed sharply.
During her visit here last month, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton publicly assured China that its American holdings remained a reliable investment. But the sheer size of China's holdings of American debt ensure that the countries' partnership will endure, some analysts say. ''The only possibility, really, is that China will have to hold these bonds until maturity,'' said Shen Minggao, the chief economist at Caijing, a Beijing-based business magazine. ''If you start to sell those bonds, the market may collapse.''

HEADLINE: Black & Decker To Cut Salaried Workers' Wages

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The power-tool maker Black & Decker said it was cutting the base salaries of top executives and ending contributions to retirement programs because ''unprecedented challenges of the global economy'' had cut into its revenue. The company also said in a regulatory filing that it was cutting base salaries for other salaried workers by 2.5 to 5 percent. 
 A spokesman for the company said hourly workers would not have their wages reduced. The changes are to take effect in April, according to the regulatory filing. It was not immediately clear how much money the company, based in Towson, Md., hoped to save.

HEADLINE: $100 Billion the Country Could Use

 BODY:
Senate investigators estimate that Americans who hide assets in offshore bank accounts are failing to pay about $100 billion a year in taxes. In good times, that's grossly unfair and bad for the country. In times like these, it should be intolerable. The government not only needs the money, but closing down such tax scams is essential for President Obama's rescue effort to retain public support and credibility.
 Some of the banks at the center of the global financial meltdown are prominent purveyors of evasion services. UBS of Switzerland has acknowledged that as of Sept. 30, it held about 47,000 secret accounts for Americans. It has refused to disclose the names of all but a tiny number of the account holders, arguing that it would be a breach of Swiss law. But last month -- after UBS got caught soliciting business in the United States -- it admitted to breaking federal law by helping Americans hide assets, and the bank agreed to pay $780 million in fines and restitution. 
 The United States Treasury isn't the only one being shorted. The Tax Justice Network, a research and advocacy organization, estimates $11.5 trillion in assets from around the world are hidden in offshore havens. 
 The United States also isn't the only country running out of patience. In February, European leaders forged an unusually tough and united call to put the problem of ''uncooperative jurisdictions'' near the top of the agenda for the April summit of leading economies in London. (Finance ministers will discuss the issue at a preparatory meeting in London this weekend.)
 Bankers and their host countries are feeling the heat. In recent days, a rash of governments, including Andorra, Liechtenstein, Singapore and Hong Kong have said they would increase the transparency of their offshore banking business and share more information with tax authorities in depositors' home countries. 
 Even the Swiss government has caved -- somewhat. On Friday, it announced that it would exchange information with tax authorities in other countries on the basis of ''specific and justified'' requests, though it resolutely rejected ''any form of automatic exchange of information.'' Meanwhile, UBS promised to close its secret American accounts and not open any more. The United States is taking UBS to court to try to get the bank to reveal the identities of thousands of accounts. 
 The government needs more tools to crack down on such international tax evasion. The Internal Revenue Service relies on taxpayers to disclose any foreign bank accounts, and it has no means to routinely get that information from banks in jurisdictions that protect secrecy.
 Senator Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is considering legislation that would require banks to inform the I.R.S. when their clients wire money abroad. Senator Carl Levin has introduced a bill that, among other provisions, would allow the United States to bar banks in this country from doing business with foreign banks that refused to cooperate with American tax authorities. 
 This problem can't be fixed solely by American law. At the London summit, American officials should work with other governments to come up with a common set of rules to pry information from tax havens. 
 There are a variety of ideas worth serious consideration. Governments could revoke tax treaties with countries that refuse to cooperate with tax queries -- making it much more cumbersome for their companies to do international business. They could restrict their own banks from doing business with banks in uncooperative countries or subject any business with these countries to higher standards of disclosure. 
 They could start now by publishing blacklists of countries and banks that refuse to cooperate with requests for information from fiscal authorities. A few years ago, most banks and tax havens would have shrugged off such an effort. But in the current environment, they seem to be more sensitive to public shaming.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows as Imports Ease

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Trade between the United States and the rest of the world slid lower in January as weakness at home slashed import levels and a spreading global downturn cut the overseas demand for American exports, the government reported on Friday. 
 The Commerce Department said that American imports and exports totaled $285.8 billion in January, down some 20 percent from the same time a year ago. The falling trade levels underscored the broad economic contraction occurring in what the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, described as the worst financial crisis since the Depression. 
 Although the United States is sending less in goods and services abroad, import levels have fallen far more steeply, reflecting the slide in oil prices as well as lower consumer spending. The trade deficit, a measure of the gap between imports and exports, shrank for a record sixth consecutive month in January, narrowing 9.8 percent to $36 billion. 
 Imports fell 6.7 percent, to $160.9 billion, in January from a month earlier, while exports fell 5.7 percent, to $124.9 billion.
 ''It's a reflection of a worse situation domestically and globally,'' said John E. Silvia, chief economist at Wachovia in Charlotte, N.C. ''When we have weakness here, we cut out importing all those wines from Chile, and food from abroad and imported clothes, and a lot of those discretionary items.''
 The trade numbers came as some of the country's largest trading partners were reporting even starker rates of economic contraction and drops in trade levels.
 In China, exports plummeted 25.7 percent in February as the country's output of everything from toys to fashion products to metals and grain slowed. The Japanese government reported this week that its gross domestic product shrank at a revised pace of 12.1 percent a year in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 13.8 percent plunge in exports.
 Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, said that the gap between imports and exports was likely to narrow even further as the country weathers a prolonged economic decline, and Americans increase their rate of personal savings and pare their spending. 
 ''It will not represent good news to trading partners who have much spare capacity that had been used to produce mountains of products for the U.S. consumer,'' Mr. Shapiro said in a note.
 In another report, the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its preliminary index reading of confidence for March edged up to 56.6 from 56.3 in February.

And the Impact of Oil: The sharp decline in the trade deficit beginning in November largely reflects the drop in the price of crude oil, which the United States imports in large amounts.

HEADLINE: Farmers Lead a Bid To Create 2 Californias

BYLINE: By MALIA WOLLAN

DATELINE: VISALIA, Calif. 

 BODY:
After nearly 90 years on the farm, Virgil Rogers has suffered through all manner of agricultural agita, from colicky cows to oscillating milk prices to drought, both past and present. 
 But Mr. Rogers's newest source of consternation, he says, is some fellow Californians. 
 ''Those Hollywood types don't have any idea what's going on out here on the farms,'' said Mr. Rogers, a retired dairyman from Visalia, the county seat in a Central Valley region where cows far outnumber people. 
 So it is that in recent weeks Mr. Rogers, whose previous political involvement amounted to little more than writing a check to a favored candidate -- has suddenly become a leader in a secessionist movement bent on cleaving California in two. 
 But while the plan is not new -- the idea of two Californias has been floated dozens of times -- the motivations and geographical scissor-work are. Frustrated by what they call uninformed urban voters dictating faulty farm policy, Mr. Rogers and the other members of the movement have proposed splitting off 13 counties on the state's coast, leaving the remaining 45, mostly inland, counties as the ''real'' California. 
 The reason, they say, is that people in those coastal counties, which include San Francisco and Los Angeles, simply do not understand what life is like in areas where the sea breezes do not reach. 
 ''They think fish are more important than people, that pigs are treated mean and chickens should run loose,'' said Mr. Rogers, who said he hitched a ride in 1940 to Visalia from Oklahoma to escape the Dust Bowl, with his wife and baby son in tow. ''City people just don't know what it takes to get food on their table.''
 The final straw for folks like Mr. Rogers was Proposition 2, a ballot measure in November that banned the tight confinement of egg-laying hens, veal calves and sows. While many food activists and politicians in the state hailed the vote as proof of consumers' increasing interest in where their food comes from, the proposition's passage has angry farmers and their allies wanting to put the issue of secession to a vote, perhaps as soon as 2012. 
 ''We have to ask ourselves, Is there a better way to govern this state?'' asked a former Republican member of the California Assembly, Bill Maze, president and a founder of the nonprofit group, Citizens for Saving California Farming Industries, which is spearheading the secessionists' efforts. Mr. Rogers, another co-founder, is chairman of the board.
 When he sat down to divvy up the counties, Mr. Maze said, he made sure to keep the large suburban and conservatively leaning counties east of Los Angeles on his side of the border, assuring a majority of the population. He plans to spend the next several years selling their residents on the benefits of secession.
 Since statehood was granted in 1850, ''there have been more than 200 serious-minded calls for the division of the state,'' said Kevin Starr, a professor of history at the University of Southern California and a former state librarian. 
 Agitators in northern California and southern Oregon have been angling to establish a state, which they would call Jefferson, since 1941. In 1993, the California Assembly passed a proposal to split the state in three, though it later died in the Senate. Under the United States Constitution, any such plan would require Congressional approval. 
 These efforts at division point to California's ''cultural disjunctions,'' ''red-blue divide'' and ''sectional anxiety,'' Mr. Starr said. 
 The mood for secession has also been amplified by a string of hard luck years in Central Valley cities like Visalia, 40 miles southeast of Fresno. California's agricultural heartland is at the epicenter of the foreclosure crisis, and counties there have some of the highest unemployment rates in the country. A drought has farmers scrambling for water.
 Some farmers are also suspicious of the political direction in Sacramento, the state capital. In January the Senate Agriculture Committee was renamed the Food and Agriculture Committee, signaling a broader, more consumer-oriented approach to agricultural policy. The committee's chairman, State Senator Dean Florez, Democrat of Fresno, finds the secession effort emblematic of larger tensions between food consumers and producers.
 ''Rather than split California, come sit at the table with consumers,'' Mr. Florez said. ''The agricultural industry is in this mode that says, 'You will eat what's put in front of you,' and that's a very condescending view of consumers and eaters. If customers are changing their preferences, the industry needs to change its ways.''
 Food and animal rights activists here agree with Mr. Florez. ''It's unfair to say consumers don't care about farmers,'' said Rebecca Spector of the Center for Food Safety. ''With the increase in food-borne illnesses, all eaters, both urban and rural, have the right to demand food that is grown in a safe and healthy way.''
 The secessionists have a long way to go. The group has raised only about $12,000, a meager sum in a state where ballot campaigns come with multimillion-dollar price tags. Still, since the group unveiled its Web site, www.downsizeca.org, in mid-February, at least 150 people a day have signed up to receive information and offer their services to the cause, Mr. Maze said.
 Mr. Rogers contributed $3,000 of his savings. Most of that went to rent a booth at the World Ag Expo, an agricultural fair near Visalia, in January. Several thousand people stopped by the booth, and many left carrying fliers and wearing ''Downsize California'' T-shirts, all of which Mr. Rogers took as evidence of money well spent. 
 ''I'm an old hound dog,'' he said. ''If I'm barking up a tree, I want to know how many squirrels are up there.''

HEADLINE: Bad Economy Leads Patients To Put Off Surgery, or Rush It

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
As the recession deepens, doctors and hospitals are reporting that hard-pressed patients are deferring elective surgery, like knee replacements and nose jobs, even as others are speeding up non-urgent procedures out of fear that they may soon lose their jobs and health insurance.
 With unemployment still rising, there are wide variations by region and type of surgery. That means that highly regarded orthopedic surgeons in Chicago may be as busy as ever, while gastroenterologists in Atlanta are scrambling to fill cancellations.
 But even those whose operating rooms are booked months in advance say they anticipate a slowdown later this year.
 Delaying elective procedures can have serious medical consequences, as when a detectable polyp develops into a tumor because a patient skips a colonoscopy. Some hospitals said their emergency rooms were already seeing patients with dire conditions that could have been avoided had they not deferred surgery for economic reasons. 
 ''We're probably seeing five or six of those a day at each of our hospitals,'' said Zeff Ross, a senior vice president at Memorial Healthcare System, which operates six hospitals in South Florida. ''Someone gets an attack of diverticulitis, but they wait. They get it a second time and the doctor tells them to get the surgery done now, but they still wait. The third time, it perforates and that's a much tougher surgery, much more dangerous for the patient and with a longer length of stay.'' 
 The slowdown is likely to have significant financial repercussions. Elective operations are typically covered by private insurance plans that tend to reimburse hospitals and doctors at higher rates than government insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid. As those payments dwindle, so do hospital profit margins and the resources to provide charity care to a growing number of uninsured.
 ''Elective admissions could represent only 9 or 10 percent of a hospital's admissions and yet represent 25 percent of its bottom line,'' said Michael A. Sachs, chief executive of Sg2, a health care consulting firm. ''They're the patients that subsidize the underfunding associated with Medicaid and Medicare patients and uncompensated care.''
 The loss of revenue and growth in uncompensated care is conspiring with other byproducts of the recession -- declining philanthropy, battered investments and tight credit -- to force many hospitals to lay off workers, postpone expansions and cancel equipment purchases.
 A study released in November by the American Hospital Association found that about one-third of hospitals had seen either a moderate or significant decrease in elective procedures in the previous three months. More recent studies in states like New Jersey and Georgia have put the figure closer to 50 percent. Ambulatory surgical centers, which had experienced exponential growth over the last decade, are also reporting a slowdown in some markets. 
 Dr. David S. George, an Ohio ophthalmologist who with two other physicians owns an outpatient eye center, said they performed 5 percent fewer cataract operations in 2008 than in 2007, following nearly a decade of consistent 10 percent annual growth.
 ''That was the first down year we've had,'' Dr. George said. ''When we tell patients about the benefits of cataract surgery, we're getting more answers like, 'Well, it's not that bad yet. Let's check it out in six months or a year.' Even those with good insurance are very concerned about the co-pay and the out-of-pocket costs.''
 That is the case for Jane Bagwell, a 60-year-old legal secretary in Atlanta, who has chosen to delay surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff in her left shoulder, even though she rates her pain as an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. 
 In a less terrifying economy, Ms. Bagwell said, she would not hesitate to schedule the operation. These days, however, she finds herself pinching every penny, including the ones that would help her pay the 20 percent share of surgical costs not covered by insurance. And given that her law firm is laying off staff members, she worries that if she took three weeks off to recuperate, her job might be eliminated before she could return. 
 Instead, she pops ibuprofen. ''I feel like I live off them,'' she said.
 The trends are far from universal, with some physicians and hospitals saying they have seen little change. Several doctors interviewed reported that some of their patients were deferring procedures while others were accelerating them. 
 ''They're trying to get things done next week because they know they're going to be losing their insurance or going to Cobra,'' said Dr. Jeffrie L. Kamean, an Atlanta gastroenterologist.
 Dr. Kamean was referring to the federal law that allows laid-off workers to continue their employer-sponsored insurance, though at costs that are often prohibitive (the federal stimulus package provides money to subsidize Cobra expenses). 
 Val Arnold, 37, a skin cancer survivor who lives in Holly, Mich., said she chose to have reconstructive surgery on her nose on Feb. 13 because she had been laid off from her job with General Motors and would lose her employer-sponsored insurance on March 1. She would have preferred to wait, so that she would be immediately available if the automaker reactivated her job.
 ''It was like all of a sudden I have to get it done now,'' Ms. Arnold said during her two-week recuperation. ''What if they call me this week?''
 Health experts predict that as the economy worsens, more insured people will begin deferring care because they cannot afford the high deductibles common in the insurance market.
 ''During good economic times, the trade-offs aren't as severe,'' said David Dranove, a professor of health-industry management at Northwestern University. ''It's that $2,000 for elective surgery versus that vacation in Cancun. Now it's $2,000 for the surgery versus making the mortgage payments, and suddenly the surgery can wait.''
 At Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., outpatient surgical volumes are down 10 percent so far this year compared with 2008. At Elkhart General Hospital in Elkhart, Ind., site of a Caterpillar plant that has seen huge layoffs, the 498 operations in January were 28 fewer than in January 2008 and 63 fewer than projected in this year's budget, said Gregory W. Lintjer, the president.
 ''We're seeing a slowdown in hip and knee replacements, the kind of things that people can live with a little longer if they so choose,'' Mr. Lintjer said.
 Not surprisingly, the steepest drop has been in plastic surgery, which is typically not covered by insurance. Dr. John W. Canady, the president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, said business seemed to be off by an average of 30 percent among his members, particularly for surgical procedures.
 On the other hand, Dr. Canady said, plastic surgeons are starting to field requests for Botox and other minor aesthetic improvements from middle-aged patients who find themselves competing for jobs against younger applicants.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 18, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the recession's effect on patients' decisions to defer or speed up elective surgery misidentified the site of a Caterpillar plant that has had huge layoffs. It is in Peoria, Ill., not Elkhart, Ind.

HEADLINE: Japan Backs U.S. Calls for More Stimulus Spending

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER and HIROKO TABUCHI; Hiroko Tabuchi contributed reporting from Tokyo.

 BODY:
The Japanese government promised on Friday another round of spending to help the world's second-largest economy emerge from a recession.
 The pledge came on the eve of a weekend meeting of finance officials from the Group of 20 nations, which are split over the need for additional spending. 
 The United States and Britain have been pressing other nations to step up stimulus measures, while continental Europe has instead favored an overhaul of financial market regulation.
 The position of deeply indebted Japan has been unclear, but Friday's renewed pledges by Prime Minister Taro Aso and his finance minister for a third round of spending since last year put Japan squarely in the camp of the United States, sharpening a possible face-off with Europe when finance officials meet outside London this weekend.
 Kaoru Yosano, the finance minister, said in Tokyo before leaving for G-20 meeting that he hoped Japan would have its spending plan in place in time for the summit in April.
 Mr. Yosano said he ''intended to voice his strong approval'' for a call by the Treasury secretary Timothy F. Geithner for nations to start stimulus measures equivalent to 2 percent of gross domestic product.
 Mr. Aso's popularity has hit a low ahead of national elections later this year. His ruling Liberal Democratic Party risks losing power, and Japan's flailing economy is partly to blame.
 Japan's economy, second only to the United States', slid into a recession last year -- contracting 12.1 percent on an annualized basis during the last quarter of 2008, according to revised government statistics out earlier this week -- as global demand for its export goods slumped last year.
 The government has already announced spending programs worth about $100 billion, and other steps to ease the financial squeeze that many companies there face.
 Other measures include purchases of commercial paper, a type of short-term corporate debt, by the central bank, as well as a decision, announced Friday, to inject 121 billion yen, or $1.2 billion, into three regional banks.
 Still, many economists have criticized the government's policy action to date as inadequate and as dominated by political posturing ahead of the elections.
 Mounting evidence in the last few weeks that the global slowdown is deeper and is likely to be more protracted than initially feared has heightened the debate about whether governments should focus first on better regulation or on emergency spending.
 Several European governments, notably Germany, are wary of the swelling debt they are accumulating and favor a more cautious approach.
 They argue that the time is not yet right for more spending or tax cuts, and that the focus for the time being should be on regulatory improvement.
 Mr. Aso and Mr. Yosano cited the worsening global environment as a reason for pledging yet another stimulus package.
 ''We are facing an unprecedented economic crisis. The ruling parties should make their utmost efforts to help ride out this difficulty,'' Mr. Aso told top officials of the Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner, the New Komeito Party, The Associated Press reported.
 He gave no details as to the size of any planned spending or tax incentives.

HEADLINE: Labor Secretary Proposes Suspending Farm Rules

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis announced Friday that she would suspend regulations that the Bush administration introduced in December to make it easier and cheaper for agricultural employers to use foreign workers in temporary jobs. 
 Just hours after being officially sworn on Friday morning, Ms. Solis said she would suspend the regulations for nine months. The move could create turmoil for growers who had already applied to bring in temporary farm workers under the new rules. 
 Last year, tens of thousands of foreign workers were brought in under the temporary agricultural program, known as H-2A, harvesting lettuce, sweet potatoes, tobacco, cucumbers, sugar cane and other crops. The new rules cut the wages that many of these workers will receive and reduced the amount that growers had to reimburse these workers for their travel. They also eased administrative burdens by letting employers simply attest that they had met various program requirements. Ms. Solis, who criticized the rules when she was in Congress, said suspending them was ''the prudent and responsible action'' to take ''because many stakeholders have raised concerns about the H-2A regulations.''
 Many farm worker and labor groups had attacked the Bush regulations, saying they would push down wages for H-2A workers and take away jobs from workers in the United States. Growers generally applauded the rules, saying they would reduce red tape in employing foreign seasonal workers who they said did arduous farm jobs that few Americans wanted to do.
 Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao announced the rules on Dec. 18, and they took effect on Jan. 17. Ms. Solis said the proposed suspension would be open for public comment for 10 days.
 ''It will throw a lot of people into limbo,'' said Sharon Hughes, a consultant to many growers who use H-2A workers. ''A lot of people have placed orders for these workers, and this will cause some panic in the industry.''
 Erik Nicholson, a national vice president of the United Farm Workers, applauded Ms. Solis's decision, calling the Bush rules ''some of the worst setbacks for farm workers in decades.'' He added, ''They meant worse wages and worse housing conditions for these workers and worse discrimination against American workers.''
 Labor Department officials said one reason for the suspension was a fear that there would be major administrative delays in granting temporary work visas.
 In December, Ms. Solis, then a California representative, condemned the regulations. 
 ''With many families already burdened by this bad economy,'' she said, ''our nation cannot afford these guest worker program changes. There is no question that the guest-worker program needs significant overhaul, but slashing wages and reducing basic rights for the most vulnerable workers in our country, especially hardworking Latino farm workers, is not the answer.'' 
 Jasper Hempel, executive vice president of the Western Growers Association, praised the Bush rules as reducing red tape. But he said the nation needed legislation, known as the AgJOBS bill, that would stabilize the farm labor situation by giving the more than one million illegal farm workers a path to legalization.

HEADLINE: The Ph.D. Struggle: Sisyphus in the Academy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Doctoral Candidates Anticipate Hard Times'' (Arts pages, March 7): 
 It has long required almost Sisyphean effort to get a decent tenure-track or tenured job in the humanities, a situation that has indeed become more dire of late. 
 One of the reasons that academics are so vulnerable to economic downturns is that it's easy for a university to do without classes in certain topics for a period of time. It is very rarely a crisis when a history department is short one Americanist. 
 This is not to justify the fact that universities make speedy recourse to the ''hiring freeze'' option. Just the opposite. I'm certainly not the only professor I know who discourages the best and brightest from pursuing a Ph.D. in the humanities, and although I believe such advice to be in the best interest of most students, it is certainly not in the best interest of our education system. 
 I would hope that universities would be less quick to cancel all job searches for professors in times of economic trial; doing so makes the academic job market all the more insecure, and makes it all the less compelling a career option for our most gifted students.
 Michelle Karnes Palo Alto, Calif., March 8, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Because every few years you publish an article discussing the difficulties that Ph.D.'s in the humanities have in finding work as tenure-track professors, there was little new in your most recent article. The truth is that the academic job market has been in a free fall for more than 20 years. 
 What is new -- and what was not discussed in your article -- is the creation of a community of like-minded Ph.D.'s who have left the academy and who have worked since the late 1990s to educate graduate students and academics about careers outside the academy. 
 List-serves and Web sites addressing this issue can now be found all over the Web, and Ph.D.'s in different disciplines have used these sites to find employment in a variety of fields.
 In the last 15 years, these Ph.D.'s have brought their very real skills to bear on an extraordinary range of jobs outside the academy. 
 Change may be slow, but it does occur.
 Alexandra M. Lord Washington, March 9, 2009
 The writer is the co-creator of Beyond Academe, a Web site that educates historians about careers outside the academy.

HEADLINE: MGM Mirage Hires Adviser In Effort To Avoid Default

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
MGM Mirage, the casino giant whose investors include the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, has hired a bankruptcy and restructuring adviser as it considers options to stave off default, people briefed on the matter said. MGM Mirage is working with Evercore Partners as it seeks to negotiate with lenders on potentially revising the terms of its debt load. Analysts have said that the company may agree to give its banks liens on its properties, including casinos like the Bellagio. The company has already agreed to sell its Treasure Island casino for $775 million. 
 With the recession sapping away customers, Las Vegas casinos have struggled to meet their debt obligations, much of which was racked up during large expansions when times were flush. Beyond meeting its debt payments, MGM Mirage needs about $1 billion to complete its City Center project, a giant residential and casino complex in the middle of Las Vegas.

HEADLINE: Six Flags in Negotiations To Stave Off Chapter 11

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
Will parents let their children ride a roller coaster owned by a bankrupt company?
 Six Flags hopes it does not have to learn the answer.
 Six Flags, the big theme park chain that is closely associated with the owner of the Washington Redskins, Dan Snyder, has a payment of nearly $300 million to holders of preferred stock due this year that it has no way of paying. So for several months now, the company, which is run by Mark S. Shapiro, and its advisers have been discussing a restructuring agreement with its bondholders that would keep the company out of bankruptcy court.
 ''We're in active dialogue with our lenders to restructure our enormous debt load,'' said Mr. Shapiro, the former head of programming and production at ESPN. ''The debt load we inherited is stifling our growth.'' 
 Outside the glare of government bailouts for big banks and federal support for automakers are companies like Six Flags, whose day-to-day businesses may be solid but whose balance sheet is loaded with debt that was piled on during the credit boom but cannot be supported by cash flow from operations.
 As such, restructuring negotiations like Six Flags' are taking place behind the scenes throughout the economy.
 ''This is a very complicated situation,'' said Joseph Stauff, a debt analyst at CRT Capital in Stamford, Conn., who closely follows Six Flags' balance sheet.
 Six Flags has hired the boutique investment bank Houlihan Lokey to advise it on restructuring and the law firm Paul Hastings to prepare for a potential bankruptcy filing. 
 But as part of its pursuit of a parallel track of an out-of-court settlement, it has presented to lenders a proposal that would give holders of several batches of bonds about 85 percent of the equity in the company in exchange for wiping out debt worth about $900 million. That plan has hit a significant snag, a common development in the high-stakes poker game that restructurings often resemble.
 A fund manager at Fidelity in Boston, who runs the Fidelity Capital and Income Fund and owns some of the Six Flags bonds that mature in 2010, has been reluctant to agree to the out-of-court plan that has recently been offered, while other debt holders have suggested they would sign on. This makes the prospect of bankruptcy more likely. 
 But it could also be a bluff on the part of the fund manager, or a maneuver to buy time -- the first payment comes due in August -- to extract more value out of Six Flags. Interestingly, other fund mangers at Fidelity that own other Six Flags bonds across the company's capital structure are in agreement with the out-of-court proposal, say executives briefed on the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were meant to be private.
 A spokesman for Fidelity said the fund management firm had a policy against commenting on ''individual credits or companies.''
 Under the out-of-court proposal, existing common stockholders would receive 5 percent of the equity in the company, and preferred stockholders would receive 10 percent. With a bankruptcy filing, they would be wiped out. As a result, shares of Six Flags matched their record low of 16 cents in trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.
 David Preiser, senior managing director at Houlihan Lokey, noted the ''inevitable difficulties and disagreements which are a normal part of the restructuring process.''
 Mr. Preiser said: ''We have been in continuing discussions with many of the company's larger bondholders to discuss various restructuring alternatives and elicit their views and support. All of the large bondholders we have spoken with have been supportive of the concept of an out-of-court solution.''
 Like the automobile executives who worry about the taint of bankruptcy could have on car sales, management at Six Flags is wondering how attendance at its many theme parks would be affected if the company were forced into Chapter 11.
 Mr. Stauff at CRT Capital estimates that if the company files for bankruptcy, its attendance would fall by about 6 percent -- compared with a current estimate of a 3.5 percent decline in 2009 from 2008 attendance as the economy continues to soften. 
 He estimated bankruptcy would cost the company about $25 million. In a recent research report, Mr. Stauff wrote that a bankruptcy filing ''would deter some customers from pursuing a high-speed roller coaster ride'' even if the company insisted there would be no cutbacks.
 A bankruptcy filing would not affect the operations of the park, including the safety of rides and the cleanliness of the premises, executives said. The company has plenty of cash on hand, about $210 million, to finance its operations.
 In 2005, Mr. Snyder gained effective control of Six Flags after buying up shares and waging a successful proxy contest to replace management. Mr. Snyder still owns almost 6 percent of the company, and another big investor is Cascade Investments, owned by Bill Gates, which owns about 11 percent.
 Mr. Shapiro, 35 at the time and something of a wunderkind at ESPN, was appointed chief executive, and over the last several years has engineered a makeover of the company, selling several underperforming parks and cleaning up others to make them more family friendly. 
 He ordered more costumed characters like Tweety and Sylvester the Cat to roam parks and installed bathroom attendants. And to attract families, and ward off troublemaking teenagers that roamed the parks, the company banned smoking, tripled security and instituted a code-of-conduct policy. In 2006 and 2007, years in which the company lost money, Mr. Shapiro spent more than $100 million to clean up the parks.
 The efforts paid off in 2008, when revenue rose 5 percent, to $1 billion, and its operating income jumped threefold, to $144 million.
 Six Flags also acquired Dick Clark Productions, which produces the Golden Globes and American Music Awards, and Mr. Shapiro positioned the company as a mini-Walt Disney that offered families a similar experience, but at lower cost. 
 The company has been weighed down by more than $2 billion in debt, which even in vibrant economic times would be untenable. But absent the credit squeeze, the company would probably be able to shed debt by selling unused real estate -- Six Flags has unused real estate near parks in Largo, Md., and Jackson, N.J. -- or refinance so it could more easily make payments with its cash flow.
 ''No matter the outcome of our restructuring conversations, this is a back-of-house issue and the guest will not see a lick of difference in our award-winning product this summer,'' Mr. Shapiro said.

HEADLINE: Chinese Dissident, Newly Freed, Calls His Imprisonment 'an Honor'

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
The day after he was released from Beijing No. 2 Prison, Yang Zili sat down at a McDonald's and, over a cup of Sprite, tried to make sense of his life.
 After eight years in prison on charges that an informal political discussion group he organized in 2000 was seeking to overthrow the Communist Party, the intellectual seemed dazed by his new freedom, his youthful exuberance sapped by years of detention, the occasional smile quickly subsumed by melancholy.
 ''I still don't understand why we were punished so severely,'' he said. ''We never broke any laws. I have no regrets.'' As China grapples with its still-developing mesh of economic openness and strict political control, those like Mr. Yang deemed to have crossed the blurry line between free speech and subversion can end up in prison, their harsh sentences meted out as warnings to others. When they finally are released, the next step is not always apparent. 
 An Internet entrepreneur with a master's in mechanics, Mr. Yang, 37, said he was not sure how he would earn a living. For now, he is staying with a friend. 
 His wife, who once made regular visits to see him in prison, stopped coming in recent years and has since moved to the United States. ''I'm not even sure where she is,'' he said quietly. 
 Simpler needs were addressed. On Friday, he made his first purchases: a pair of shiny black loafers and a tan windbreaker.
 Mr. Yang gained his freedom the same day as his friend, Zhang Honghai, 36, a freelance writer who was also a member of the New Youth Society, a study group that sought to tackle topics like government corruption, democracy and the unrelenting poverty of rural China. The group rarely drew more than four or five participants and met sporadically during the course of a few months before its members were detained. 
 Two other defendants, Xu Wei and Jin Haike, are scheduled to be released next year.
 The defendants, who came to be known as the Four Gentlemen of Beijing, were convicted during a trial that relied on their Internet postings advocating political liberalization and the written testimony of three friends who later recanted those accounts. 
 One of those friends, Li Yizhou, fled to Thailand and tried to help the defendants by submitting letters to the court saying his reports to security officials were exaggerated or fabricated. 
 The letters were rejected. 
 Human rights organizations have long sought the release of the men, citing the severity of their sentences and pointing out that none of those convicted were veteran dissidents. They say the defendants, all in their 20s and graduates of the country's most prestigious universities, were simply earnest young men eager to debate the problems that face a rapidly modernizing China. 
 ''The authorities destroyed the lives of young people who were simply exercising freedoms that are supposedly protected by Chinese law,'' said Sharon Hom, executive director of Human Rights in China, a group based in New York. For Mr. Yang and Mr. Zhang, those freedoms are now proscribed by the terms of their release. For two years, they have no right to free speech, assembly or association, and are forbidden to discuss politics.
 Even Mr. Yang's carefully chosen words with a reporter at McDonald's could put him at risk. 
 Although prison dulled what friends describe as an infectious optimism and an ardor for verbal polemics, it has not dimmed his admiration for democracy, Mr. Yang said.
 He brightened slightly when recalling his final words before the sentence was read. ''Imprisonment is not my shame,'' he announced to the court. ''It's my honor.''
 He acknowledges that his defiance probably contributed to the relatively harsh treatment he endured in prison. He said he had been kept in a cell with rapists, murderers and drug dealers, and could receive visitors only once a month. 
 Every phone call -- and what he planned to talk about -- had to be approved in advance. 
 The son of poor farmers who started his own software company, Mr. Yang said that books and magazines had sustained him -- the French philosopher Montesquieu and Vaclav Havel, the Czech the playwright and dissident who was elected president, were favorites -- along with the reams of poetry and essays he wrote. He also taught other inmates how to use computers, although he was not allowed to use the Internet. 
 Overall, Mr. Yang said that his treatment was far better than that of his friends, who have reportedly been ailing. According to Human Rights in China, Mr. Xu became mentally ill after being subjected to torture and hard labor, and Mr. Jin has been suffering from an untreated intestinal ailment. 
 Before heading back out to the street on Friday, Mr. Yang said he was not bitter about what happened to him, just sad that the group he helped start had indirectly destroyed the lives of so many friends. ''I couldn't have imagined,'' he said, ''that spreading ideas such as freedom and democracy would lead to something so horrible.''

HEADLINE: In Italy, the Vending Machine Bakes

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: ROVERETO, Italy 

 BODY:
Is Europe bringing back the automat? Claudio Torghele hopes so.
 Over the last decade, Mr. Torghele, 56, an entrepreneur in this northern Italian city who first made money selling pasta in California, has developed a vending machine that cooks pizza. The machine does not just slip a frozen pizza into a microwave. It actually whips up flour, water, tomato sauce and fresh ingredients to produce a piping hot pizza in about three minutes.
 The machine, which Mr. Torghele calls Let's Pizza, is only the spearhead of a trend. Restaurants reminiscent of the old Horn & Hardart chain in the United States, which are fully automatic, are also showing up around the Continent. 
 Unlike the old automats (the last Horn & Hardart closed in 1991), which were staffed with workers who refilled the machines with creamed spinach and baked beans as fast as customers pulled them out, these restaurants consist entirely of vending machines. 
 In Milan, a two-hour drive west of Rovereto, a franchise chain called Brekky has opened the first three of what is planned to be a large chain of restaurants in which customers can buy cold dishes like salads and sandwiches, and warm dishes like pasta, from vending machines.
 North of the Alps, the automat never really died out. In the Netherlands, Febo, a chain started in 1941 by a Dutch baker, now has about 60 restaurants. In France, bright green and yellow Yatoo Partoo machines -- the name loosely translates as ''You can get everything, everywhere'' -- sell milk, juice, snacks and sandwiches 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
 The European vending machine industry, which has grown significantly and now has annual sales of about 26 billion euros, or $33 billion, hopes the trend will catch on. 
 Much recent growth came with the placing of vending machines in factories and offices, where employees took coffee breaks or lunch from machines. But as recession bit into Europe and factories and offices closed, that market has contracted. 
 At the same time, Europeans are looking for less expensive ways to eat out, and the automat is far less expensive than a white-tablecloth restaurant.
 ''These are developments that we are watching,'' said Luciano Iannuzzi, chief executive of Argenta in Carpi, Italy, a large vending operator with about 120,000 machines. 
 The idea for a pizza robot came to Mr. Torghele after he worked in California in the mid-1990s creating a fresh pasta manufacturer. ''At food courts I saw a trend toward vending machines,'' he said at his office in this mountain town. ''In fast food, I saw pizza everywhere.'' 
 With backing from a Dutch investment fund, his own capital and money from friends, he set to work. A plan to simply miniaturize industrial technology for producing frozen pizza failed, but by 2003 Mr. Torghele had produced a machine ready to be tested in Chicago and shown at a trade fair in Orlando, Fla.
 That same year, with the help of Unilever, the British-Dutch food giant, he test-marketed 20 machines in Germany. ''We had a bicycle,'' he said. ''Now we had to pedal.'' 
 The machine Mr. Torghele and his engineers produced is outfitted with little windows so the customer can watch the pizza being made. As in the Charlie Chaplin film ''Modern Times'' (in miniature and without Chaplin) wheels turn and gears grind. The customer presses a button to choose one of four varieties -- margherita (plain cheese and tomato sauce), bacon, ham or fresh greens. A plastic container dumps flour into a drum resembling a tiny washing machine; a squirt of water follows, and the drum goes into a spin cycle, forming a blob of dough that is then pressed flat to form a 12-inch disk.
 Tomato paste is squirted onto the dough and cheese is added before it is lifted into a small infrared oven. The baked pizza then slips onto a cardboard tray and out into the customer's waiting hands. Mr. Torghele says the pizza will cost as little $4.50, depending on the variety.
 It is not surprising that the new drive to offer fresh-made food is coming from Italy. Italians may be legendary for long lunches of pasta and wine, but they also lead Europe in vending machines, with more than 614,000 installed, compared with 593,000 in France and 562,000 in Britain, according to the European Vending Association in Brussels.
 Much of Italy's strength in vending comes from coffee. An Italian coffee vending machine may offer up to 18 different varieties, including espresso, cappuccino, ristretto, lungo and macchiato. 
 But with coffee markets increasingly saturated, machine manufacturers are casting about for new products to push, like books, DVDs, scarves and handkerchiefs, even model cars and trains. 
 Operators are also increasingly offering fresh produce, like apples, and other healthy food at schools and fitness centers.
 ''Vending hasn't arrived at the end of the road,'' said Mr. Iannuzzi, 52, of Argenta. ''It's mature, but it's growing.''
 Argenta reflects the opportunities that vending offered to investors. In 2005, Argenta was snapped up by Advent International, a British equity fund, which turned around and sold it in late 2007 to an Italian fund, Cognetas. In that time, Argenta had doubled its annual revenue, to $260 million, partly through acquisitions and partly through growth.
 Now, with the economic crisis spreading across Europe, the industry faces a different landscape. On the one hand, as factories close, potential vending machine sites disappear. On the other hand, as consumers find themselves with less cash, the lower-priced items in vending machines become attractive.
 Where does this leave Mr. Torghele and his pizza machine? Initially, he thought the United States would be his primary market, but he learned that market would be hard to penetrate. Instead, when his machine goes into regular production this summer, he will be focusing on Italy and its neighbors. But vending machine prices there average about $2,600, and his machine will sell for $32,000.
 Still, experts in the business are not discouraging. ''You have to have a location; you have to understand where to go with that machine,'' Mr. Iannuzzi said. ''But there is a future for that.''

HEADLINE: Weary of Looking for Work, Some Create Their Own Businesses

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL and JENNA WORTHAM; Matt Richtel reported from San Francisco, and Jenna Wortham from New York.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Alex Andon, 24, a graduate of Duke University in biology, was laid off from a biotech company last May. For months he sought new work. Then, frustrated with the hunt, he turned to jellyfish.
 In an apartment he shares here with six roommates, Mr. Andon started a business in September building jellyfish aquariums, capitalizing on new technology that helps the fragile creatures survive in captivity. He has sold three tanks, one for $25,000 to a restaurant, and is starting a Web site to sell desktop versions for $350.
 ''I keep getting stung,'' he said. And his crowded home office is filled with beakers and test tubes of jellyfish food. ''But it beats looking for work. I hate looking for work.''
 Plenty of other laid-off workers across the country, burned out by a merciless job market, are building business plans instead of sending out resumes. For these people, recession has become the mother of invention. 
 Economists say that when the economy takes a dive, it is common for people to turn to their inner entrepreneur to try to make their own work. But they say that it takes months for that mentality to sink in, and that this is about the time in the economic cycle when it really starts to happen -- when the formerly employed realize that traditional job searches are not working, and that they are running out of time and money.
 Mark V. Cannice, executive director of the entrepreneurship program at the University of San Francisco, calls the phenomenon ''forced entrepreneurship.'' 
 ''If there is a silver lining, the large-scale downsizing from major companies will release a lot of new entrepreneurial talent and ideas -- scientists, engineers, business folks now looking to do other things,'' Mr. Cannice said. ''It's a Darwinian unleashing of talent into the entrepreneurial ecosystem.'' 
 Even in prosperous times, entrepreneurs have a daunting failure rate. But those who succeed could play a big role in turning the economy around because tiny companies are actually big employers. In 2008, 3.8 million companies had fewer than 10 workers, and they employed 12.4 million people, or roughly 11 percent of the private sector work force, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 Economists say there are some peculiarities to this wave of downturn start-ups. Chiefly, the Internet has given people an extraordinary tool not just to market their ideas but also to find business partners and suppliers, and to do all kinds of functions on the cheap: keeping the books, interacting with customers, even turning a small idea into a big idea.
 The goal for many entrepreneurs nowadays is not to create a company that will someday make billions but to come up with an idea that will produce revenue quickly, said Jerome S. Engel, director for the center for entrepreneurship at the Berkeley Haas School of Business. Mr. Engel said many people will focus on serving immediate needs for individuals and businesses.
 ''It's a very painful thing,'' he said of the pressure people feel to find new ways to make money. ''But it's a healthy thing.'' 
 Mr. Engel noted that the dot-com bust helped propel a pack of hardy companies. One of those, in fact, was Google. While it was started in the late 1990s, the company succeeded during the bust in part because it was highly focused and did not need much capital, Mr. Engel said.
 Ryan Kuder, 35, understands the notion of scaled-down start-up fervor -- and the worry and exhilaration that goes along with it. He was laid off in February 2008 from Yahoo, where he was a senior marketing manager. He job-hunted for a bit, then decided to start an Internet company that would let people do social networking at the neighborhood level. 
 Mr. Kuder and his business partner toiled until November, when he realized his big dreams had run headlong into reality. He needed money to pay the mortgage and buy health insurance for his family.
 They transformed the company into a new one called Koombea that designs and builds Web sites for businesses. Koombea has grown to nine people, most of them in Colombia, where the cost of living allows them to do Web design relatively inexpensively.
 Mr. Kuder and his wife agreed that he would give up working for Koombea at the end of January if he did not hit certain revenue goals. They narrowly missed the target. For a few days, Mr. Kuder sent out resumes. He found no work, so he is back investing himself full time in Koombea -- and says he is feeling transformed.
 ''My sleeves are rolled up, and I'm dirtier than I've ever been before,'' he said. ''It's incredibly nerve-wracking. I wake up nauseous everyday. But it's probably easier right now to find a problem, solve it and charge people than it is to find a job.''
 Monica Zamiska, 25, said it was ''traumatizing'' when she was laid off in January from her first postcollege job as a junior account executive with the public relations firm Ogilvy & Mather. After meeting with five recruiters, she began to realize how barren the job market was. ''You can only send out so many resumes,'' Ms. Zamiska said. 
 So she turned her full attention to a pet project called the Confoodant, a Web site with restaurant reviews written by a by-invitation-only network of food enthusiasts. Her main financial obligation is her rent, but with her savings and four weeks of severance pay, she is confident that she can devote at least six months to getting the project off the ground. 
 ''I love working,'' Ms. Zamiska said. ''So I made work for myself.'' 
 The surge of interest in entrepreneurship can be seen in the demand for related workshops and networking events. Monica Doss, director of FastTrac, an organization that offers training to aspiring entrepreneurs, said she expected participation to double this year from the 10,000 people it had last year. 
 ''People are thinking, 'These jobs aren't going to come back in three years. I've got to find something else to do,' '' Ms. Doss said.
 Mr. Andon, for one, seems to have found his niche. He said he recently received an order for a large jellyfish tank that should sell for tens of thousands of dollars. 
 His entrepreneurial fever seems to be catching: at least four of his roommates are starting companies. Two of those -- Erin Kitchell, 28, and her brother Andrew, 25 -- are making laminated, fold-out language guides for travelers. In the next few days they plan to print their first 8,000 copies and start trying to sell them.
 Ms. Kitchell took a voluntary buyout in June from Wachovia, sensing a layoff would come anyway, and is not sanguine about finding good work.
 ''This is as good a time as any to try something entrepreneurial,'' she said. ''There is not a lot of opportunity right now in finance.''

HEADLINE: Bargaining Down the Medical Bills

BYLINE: By LESLEY ALDERMAN

 BODY:
WHEN money is tight, everything is negotiable -- including your health care bills. 
 As the economy sheds jobs and more people lose their health insurance or are forced to switch to less generous plans, doctors and hospitals are becoming accustomed to patients who are struggling financially. According to the American Hospital Association, half of their members reported an increase in the number of patients needing help with their bills. And that was in November, before the national unemployment rate hit 8.1 percent. 
 ''It's rough out there,'' said Dr. Jacques Moritz, the director of gynecology at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York, who also has a private practice in Manhattan. (Full disclosure: He delivered my son five years ago, but my insurance at the time covered me in full.) 
 Lately, Dr. Moritz said, ''The first thing I say to my long-term patients is, 'Do you still have a job?' '' If patients say no, or otherwise indicate that paying will not be easy, Dr. Moritz says he assures them that bills are negotiable. 
 And keep in mind that doctors, hospitals and medical labs are accustomed to negotiating. After all, they do it all the time with insurers. A hospital may have a dozen or more rates for one procedure, depending on whether Medicare, Medicaid or a private insurer is paying the bill, said Ruth Levin, corporate senior vice president for managed care of Continuum Health Partners, a nonprofit hospital system in New York. Your request for a special arrangement will hardly confound their accounting department. 
 And it is usually in everyone's interest to avoid dealing with a bill collector.
 If you recently lost your insurance or have a plan with minimal benefits, here is what you need to know if you want to seek a price break from the doctor, hospital or lab. 
 Dealing With Doctors
 DON'T BE SHY ''Patients are often intimidated by their doctors -- it's the white coat,'' said Dr. Davis Liu, a family doctor in California and author of ''Stay Healthy, Live Longer, Spend Wisely'' (Stetho Publishing, 2008). ''But if you need help, speak up. Most are likely to help out.'' 
 Talk directly to your doctor about your financial situation. If that makes you uncomfortable, then go to the billing manager. The office may be able to offer you a discount of 10 to 30 percent depending on the practice (specialists may offer a bigger break), or propose a plan in which you pay your balance in a few installments or on a monthly basis -- typically at no interest. 
 OFFER TO PAY CASH UPFRONT Doctors can lose thousands of dollars every year on unpaid bills and spend countless hours haggling with insurers over reimbursements. If you can make their life simpler by offering to pay right away, you're likely to get a small discount -- even if you don't have financial hardship. 
 BE RESPECTFUL You're negotiating for your health, not haggling over a used car. So Dr. Moritz cautions you not to call your physician and say: ''Dr. So-and-So will do the procedure for $300 less. Can you match that?''
 ''When someone does that,'' Dr. Moritz says, ''that's the end of the relationship.'' 
 Talking to Hospitals
 STRIKE A DEAL, THEN CHECK IN If you need shoulder surgery, for instance, but don't have insurance -- or are facing a high hospital co-payment -- call the hospital's billing department and explain that you would like to discuss getting a discount and why. Dr. Moritz suggests saying, ''I'd like to pay the lowest rate you give an insurance company.'' 
 MAKE A COUNTEROFFER Like doctors, hospitals would rather be paid something than nothing. They lost $34 billion in 2007 on uncompensated care, up 55 percent from 2002. 
 ''Hospitals would rather set up a payment plan than turn it over to a collections agency and then expect to write it off,'' Dr. Liu said. 
 If you end up with a bill you can't pay -- or at least can't pay right away -- don't panic. Find out what Medicare would pay for your condition or surgery, since that program tends to pay less than private insurers. You can learn that at the federal Department of Health and Human Services database, www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov, by clicking on the gray button ''find and compare hospitals.'' 
 I learned on the Web site, for example, that if I were admitted to my local hospital for chest pain, the average Medicare payment would be $5,732. Use the Medicare numbers as the starting point for your negotiation. 
 The truth is, said Ms. Levin of Continuum Health Partners, ''only a very small portion of consumers or insurers pay 100 percent of our hospital charges.'' 
 If your situation is truly dire or your bill very large, you may qualify for charity care. But you'll have to show the hospital proof of your income and your hardship. 
 Bargaining With Labs
 Charges for lab work can be exorbitant. But, as with hospital bills, the numbers you see on your statement may not reflect what most insurers actually pay, according to Dr. Woodson C. Merrell, chairman of the department of integrative medicine at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. 
 Negotiate just as you would with your doctor or hospital. Quest Diagnostics, the largest clinical laboratory in the country, for instance, offers a six-month interest-free payment plan, as well as financial assistance for those with real hardship. 
 ''But we evaluate each case individually,'' says Jerry Diffley, corporate director of patient advocacy and billing compliance.

HEADLINE: A Top Editor Will Leave Time Inc. After 31 Years

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Jim Kelly, the second-ranking editor at the Time Inc. magazine chain, and formerly the top editor of Time magazine, said on Friday that he would leave the company after 31 years. 
 Mr. Kelly started at Time magazine in 1978, and worked his way up as a writer and editor, becoming the deputy managing editor and then, in 2001, the managing editor, the top editorial position. In 2006, he was promoted to managing editor of Time Inc., the division of Time Warner that is the largest American magazine publisher. He will step down on April 1.
 In his years as editor of Time, he directed coverage of war, recession, elections and natural disasters and became embroiled in a federal prosecutor's attempts to force journalists to cooperate in the C.I.A. leak case that ultimately led to the conviction of a White House official, Lewis I. Libby. Facing the threat of jail time, a Time reporter, Matthew Cooper, cooperated in that case, and Time Inc. agreed to turn over files related to his reporting.
 ''My proudest moment at Time was probably the Katrina issue,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''A lot of our people were away that week, and it looked like a weather story before turning into a tragedy, but by the time I figured it out, the staff was off and running. It really showed what they could do.''
 That issue won a National Magazine Award, one of four won by Time when Mr. Kelly was managing editor.
 He said that in his current position, he felt too far removed from the news and the work of journalism. ''I learned a lot, especially about the digital side of the business,'' he said, but his biggest achievements of the last three years ''are things I can't talk about, fires that were put out, crises averted.''
 At 55, Mr. Kelly said, ''I'm definitely too young to retire,'' but he has no immediate plans, other than to spend time at home with his wife, Lisa Henricksson, also a former magazine editor, and their 9-year-old son, and to read more books and see more films.
 ''After about two months, the family will decide we need a plan B,'' he said. ''I've been telling my son that we're going to spend more time together, do more homework together, and he would rather I continue working, believe me.''

HEADLINE: Flying Blind In Chicago

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT. 
Gail Collins is off today.

 BODY:
You can get a glimpse of what's wrong with this country by taking a ride through a huge tract of open land south of Chicago. Some of the land is used for growing corn or soybeans. Some is pasture land. 
 The area is just south of several struggling suburban municipalities, which in turn are just south of the city's economically hard hit South Side. If ever there was a region desperate for jobs and economic development, this is it. 
 So you would think that a project that would bring thousands of new jobs and long-term economic revitalization to the region would be a no-brainer.
 It has long been known that a third airport is needed in the Chicago metropolitan area. Among major airports, Chicago's O'Hare had the worst on-time departure rate in the nation last year. Midway Airport, already operating at capacity, has short runways and cannot significantly expand because of a lack of additional space.
 Flying in and out of Chicago is often a nightmare. Since the mid-1980s, numerous studies by the Federal Aviation Administration have pointed to the need for a third airport.
 Incredibly, the plans and the funding for a proposed new airport in the open spaces just below the southern Chicago suburbs, to be called the Abraham Lincoln National Airport, are ready and waiting to be implemented. The plan is innovative, a public-private partnership that would generate more than 1,000 construction jobs and 15,000 permanent jobs when the airport opened.
 The airport's sponsors estimate that it would generate billions of dollars of economic activity -- economic growth that is desperately needed in the adjacent suburban towns and the city's South Side. The state has already purchased half of the acreage needed for the project.
 So what's the hang-up? Why hasn't the project, which has been in the works since the mid-90s, gone forward?
 Simply stated, the politicians can't get their act together.
 The airport proposal has long been the primary focus of Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., a Chicago Democrat. He has spent years mastering its complexities, lining up financing that would keep taxpayer contributions to a minimum and fending off interests that do not want the competition that a third airport would bring, or who would like to carve out a corrupt stake in the project.
 The airport would be financed and built by two firms with vast airport experience: LCOR, which owns and operates International Terminal 4 at Kennedy Airport in New York, and SNC-Lavalin, which has financed and operates airports in Europe, Canada, South America and elsewhere. 
 The Chicago Tribune, one of a number of papers that has thrown editorial support behind Mr. Jackson's efforts, has written: ''It's a creative and detailed proposal that holds the best hope for the creation and expansion of a south suburban airport.''
 Barack Obama came out publicly in favor of the proposal back in 2004 when he was an Illinois state senator. In a guest editorial in The Chicago Sun-Times, he noted that there was still a need to expand O'Hare and that the airlines and the federal government would pay most of the cost of that expansion.
 But even with an expansion of O'Hare, he wrote, the volume of traffic in the region was so heavy that a third airport was needed. Mr. Jackson, he said, had assembled private investors who were willing to ''put up their capital'' for it.
 ''State government's role in the project,'' said Mr. Obama, ''would be limited to providing infrastructure improvements, such as roads, transit and sewers, which it routinely provides to other development projects around the state.''
 There are many advantages to this project, in addition to the private funding. The airport would be specifically designed to serve low-cost carriers that cannot afford to build and operate their own terminals. They would arrive and depart at ''common-use'' gates that are far more economical.
 Another feature of the airport design is that it is ''market driven,'' meaning that it would be relatively small when it opened and could easily be expanded as demand increased.
 The major airlines serving Chicago are not interested in seeing low-cost competition flying in and out of a spanking new airport, especially one with enormous growth potential. And many of the big-time politicians in and around Chicago are upset at the very thought of an airport being built in which they would be unable to control the jobs and the contracts. Airports tend to be monstrous patronage mills. This one would not be.
 The U.S. is in a world-class recession, hemorrhaging jobs and spending trillions of dollars trying to extricate itself from the mess. That this ready-to-go project is still sitting on the table, still waiting for state government approval after several long years have already been wasted, is plain nuts.

HEADLINE: In Amsterdam, Both New and Old

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
IN AMSTERDAM,
 Both New and Old
 Before this city was New York, it was New Amsterdam. So to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Dutch exploration of the New World, New York is sending a contingent to Old Amsterdam as part of a series of cultural exchanges between the two cities during the next two years. 
 The group, which leaves on Monday, will include Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president; Representative Maurice Hinchey from the Hudson Valley; and Joan K. Davidson, chairwoman of the Hudson-Fulton-Champlain Quadricentennial Commission (''It's a mouthful,'' she admitted). 
 They will, among other things, travel on Tuesday to Keukenhof Gardens, southwest of Amsterdam, where a likeness of the Statue of Liberty made of 51,000 tulips will be unveiled by Queen Beatrix.
 One of main goals of the Quadricentennial Commission is to commemorate Henry Hudson's 1609 journey from Amsterdam Harbor in a quest for a shorter trading route to Asia. Instead, he ended up in what is now New York, back when it was full of lush forests, extensive wetlands and a rich wildlife.
 The Dutch government is also playing an active role in the celebration. And in September, the South Street Seaport will display Peter Schaghen's 1626 letter that mentions the ''purchase'' of what is now Manhattan by the Dutch for 60 guilders' worth of goods -- the legendary $24. ''It's in a way the birth certificate of New York,'' said Gajus Scheltema, the consul general of the Netherlands. 
 In fact, Mr. Scheltema said, the purchase is mentioned only in passing ''It's basically about something else,'' he said. ''The focus on the letter is about the beaver skins and furs.''
 Early settlers of the land included people seeking both freedom and opportunity: Jewish refugees from Brazil, Quakers, freed African slaves, and entrepreneurs from Morocco. At its height, half of New Amsterdam's population was not Dutch. One visitor in 1643 observed that 18 languages were spoken and a wide variety of religions coexisted side by side.
 ''We believed that back in the Netherlands in the 17th century -- that an economy, an entrepreneurial society, was better served as an inclusive society, a tolerant one than an exclusive one,'' Mr. Scheltema said.
 It is an argument made by the city's leaders now as then.

HEADLINE: Even Pro Bono Work Requires Doing Your Homework First

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND. 
E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ONE common piece of advice given to the newly laid off is to seek volunteer work until a paid job comes along.
 At a minimum, volunteer work will get you out of bed in the morning. And in the best case, it can both do some good and lead to future employment.
 The trouble is that finding the right volunteer job can sometimes seem as difficult as obtaining a salaried position -- and with only psychic, rather than financial, rewards.
 Now, before I'm bombarded with e-mail from dedicated volunteers, I have heard plenty of stories about people who have done enormous good and have been greatly fulfilled through volunteer work. But it is also true that looking for and taking on volunteer jobs can be a disheartening experience, especially when you find it difficult to give as a gift the very skills you used to get paid for. 
 Problems may arise for a number of reasons. Nonprofit groups, already stretched thin, may not have the staff to adequately train and manage volunteers, or even to respond to volunteer requests. Sometimes people who come from high-powered jobs have a ''you're lucky to get me free,'' attitude that doesn't sit well. And sometimes, the organization or the position just doesn't turn out to be what you expected.
 So the first thing is to determine why you want to volunteer.
 Besides making the world a better place, ''there are two different reasons people might volunteer,'' said Kim Williams, a consultant to nonprofit groups and a teacher at the University of California, Los Angeles, extension on nonprofit governance and volunteering. ''One is to pursue an avocation or passion -- to follow your bliss. The other is to keep your skills honed.'' 
 Both reasons are valid. And in both cases, if done right, everyone can win, Ms. Williams said. 
 Looking for a volunteer job is best if undertaken as a job search, she said, with all the effort that entails. 
 All right, I can hear the groans from here. I have to do work to work free? But, Ms. Williams said, ''the more due diligence people perform, the fewer problems they will face.''
 She suggests as a first step looking at the Web site for the Urban Institute's National Center for Charitable Statistics (nccs.urban.org) for a wealth of statistical and general information about the sector, broken down by state. For more on foundations, look at foundationcenter.org.
 If you want to know about the legitimacy and financial health of an organization, look at guidestar.org. 
 Why do all this? Because volunteering nowadays can mean helping at a small animal shelter or assisting giant charities like the Red Cross or the United Way -- and plenty in between. The world of nonprofit groups has become complicated.
 The good news is that once you decide what you may be interested in, the Web has numerous resources. 
 Many states have sites like nycares.org in New York to help people get involved. Then there are national and global sites. Since 1995, Idealist.org has worked on matching both volunteers and those seeking paid jobs with nonprofit groups.
 I visited the site, and the first thing I saw was that there were 86,060 volunteers and 14,817 volunteer positions available. I was already discouraged.
 But Erin Barnhart, director of volunteerism initiatives for the Web site, said that number was a little misleading. 
 ''People can create volunteer profiles that stay up indefinitely, while volunteer opportunities are taken down once they are filled,'' she said.
 Jeremy Dyme says he has been using Idealist.org to look for a volunteer position in economic development and microfinance. A fourth-year law associate, he was laid off at the end of the year when his law firm in New York closed.
 He left Manhattan for San Francisco, where he has applied for volunteer positions. He says he hopes to parlay his volunteer experience into a new career.
 He acknowledges that his lack of expertise in microfinance may be a stumbling block in finding volunteer work in that field.
 ''After at least half a dozen offers to volunteer, both solicited and unsolicited, I have had one phone interview,'' Mr. Dyme said. ''It's funny to go from being grossly overpaid as a law firm associate to trying to market myself for a position to work for free.''
 Another possible source for skilled professionals like Mr. Dyme who are looking to volunteer is the Taproot Foundation, which operates in seven cities -- Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington. Through a grant application, it selects nonprofit clients, then screens, chooses and helps manage teams of volunteers to meet specific needs. Most participants are expected to work about five hours weekly for six months. 
 Aaron Hurst, president of the foundation, says he has no problem finding nonprofit groups that need volunteers or volunteers who want to work. The challenge now is persuading foundations and corporations to finance Taproot so he can hire enough staff.
 ''I say it's like a food pantry, with all the food inside and a long line outside, but we can't open the door,'' he said.
 And even with the best research, you can end up at a volunteer job you're not too thrilled with.
 Rebeca Holloway lost her job as a public relations manager for a credit union in Tennessee in late 2005, got married and moved to Indianapolis.
 She had to make contacts from scratch. ''So I set out immediately to network and volunteer,'' getting in touch with her state's professional organization for fund-raisers.
 She contacted everyone on the board for informational interviews and through a board member landed a volunteer job at a hospital.
 ''When we talked, it sounded really promising,'' Ms. Holloway said.
 But ''I absolutely hated it,'' she said. ''I dreaded going into the office every week. I was an educated person with a few professional years under my belt and I felt right back where I was five years prior.'' Somewhat tongue-in-cheek, she added, ''Didn't they know what an asset I could have been?''
 The trouble, as many who have volunteered know, is that ''it takes energy to delegate and sometimes it's easier for people to do it themselves,'' Ms. Holloway said. ''They had big plans for me, but it didn't work out.'' 
 So she ended up doing ''excruciatingly boring'' grunt work two days a week. 
 After about four months she got a job, not through the hospital, but she is sure her volunteering helped.
 ''Everyone knows everyone here,'' she said. So sticking it out at the hospital gave her a good reputation and a good reference.
 To avoid hating your volunteer job -- after all, that's what paid jobs are for -- ask potential workplaces about their volunteer service structure, Ms. Williams said. 
 ''And make sure they have an application process,'' she added. ''Not just, 'Yeah, we're building a house on Sunday, c'mon over.' ''
 The moral of the story is, do your research before jumping in. And, oh yes, brush that chip off your shoulder. Even if you're working free, your co-workers may find a haughty attitude too high a price to pay.

HEADLINE: Sports Museum Files Petition in Court

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
The Sports Museum of America, which opened in lower Manhattan last May and closed last month, filed a Chapter 7 liquidation petition Friday in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. It cited $55.5 million in assets and $177.1 million in liabilities. 
 Among those listed as unsecured creditors were the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which is owed $750,000; the Women's Sports Foundation, $500,000; Bob Cousy, $487,500; and the United States Olympic Committee, $300,000.
 Philip Schwalb, the museum's founder, said he was still hopeful of a sale.
 ''I'm extremely convinced, based on all the telephone calls I've had, that a good, able, credible buyer will buy it,'' he said, adding that the assets could be bought for $5 million or less. 
 The museum, which opened as the weakened economy continued to sink, did not draw anywhere near the attendance that Schwalb had predicted. It also suffered from poor marketing.
 Its assets, including display cases, films, computers and plasma screens, will be sold to pay creditors, with priority given to holders of $57 million in tax-exempt Liberty Bonds.

HEADLINE: Japan Sends Destroyers on Anti-Piracy Patrol

BYLINE: By MARK McDONALD

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
In a move to safeguard vital oil shipments, Japan said Friday it will deploy two warships to join anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden.
 ''Piracy is a threat to the international community, including Japan, and it is an issue that should be dealt with immediately,'' the defense minister, Yasukazu Hamada, said Friday in Tokyo.
 Two destroyers from Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force are due to leave southern Japan on Saturday. They will join a flotilla from the European Union, a task force led by the United States and other navies operating independently in the gulf. China has two destroyers and a supply ship there, and Iran and Russia have mounted anti-piracy patrols as well. 
 Japan's pacifist Constitution restricts the activities of its military, although the navy is allowed to conduct policing patrols and protect Japanese vessels. The deployment to the gulf would almost certainly put the destroyers in the position of having to aid ships from other nations, and Mr. Hamada said new legislation would be submitted to parliament to extend the navy's mandate.
 The deployment was not expected to be as politically sensitive as other missions in recent years. Japan sent ground troops to Iraq as part of a humanitarian mission and its naval forces to the Indian Ocean on refueling duties as part of the war in Afghanistan. 
 About 90 percent of Japan's crude oil imports come from the Middle East, according to the International Energy Agency. Japan is the world's second largest net importer of oil, after the United States. 
 The Piracy Reporting Center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, said 111 ships were attacked last year by pirates in the gulf and along the coast of Somalia. And while international shippers say the presence of the naval vessels has helped deter attacks, the reporting center said Friday that 33 ships have been hit in the gulf this year. Four have been hijacked and are being held for ransom.
 ''In the short run the situation in the gulf has improved a lot,'' Finn Brobersen, senior director in charge of security for the Maersk shipping line, said in an interview from Copenhagen. 
 ''But I don't think there's any silver bullet. Warships are not going to solve the root cause of the problem, which is the government in Somalia. In the long run, the international community has to deal with Somalia.''
 There is growing evidence that boats most easily captured by pirates -- slow vessels that sit low in the water, with what is known as a low freeboard -- are now avoiding the Gulf of Aden and going around the Cape of Good Hope. 
 ''If it's a type of boat that's vulnerable, then our policy is to go around Africa,'' said Mr. Brobersen, noting that Maersk has a wide range of merchant vessels, including container ships and supertankers. 
 The re-rerouting adds about seven days of travel time, plus extra fuel and crew costs. But fuel prices are down, and many ship owners are eager to avoid what they consider extortionate Suez Canal fees. A single Maersk merchant ship, for example, can be charged $850,000 for one passage through the canal.
 ''With canal fees so high, it's now a viable option to go the long way,'' said Tillman Kratz, a senior consultant with the reinsurer Munich Re. ''In the current economic climate, the bottom line would even out.''

HEADLINE: After Change in Federal Policy, Some States Take Steps to Limit Stem Cell Research

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN; Robbie Brown contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
Three days after President Obama announced that he would lift restrictions on federal financing for embryonic stem cell research, the Georgia legislature began a push to limit such research within the state.
 The bill, passed by the Republican-controlled Senate on Thursday, bans therapeutic cloning and the creation of embryos for any purpose other than procreation.
 Anti-abortion groups that oppose the use of human embryos for stem cell research said similar efforts would be made in other states. This week, the Mississippi House passed a bill prohibiting the University of Mississippi from using state money ''for research that kills or destroys an existing human embryo,'' and some states are considering legislation that would define an embryo as a person. 
 ''It's nothing new, and it's going to continue,'' David Prentice, the senior fellow for life sciences at the Family Research Council, a conservative anti-abortion group, said of the push for restrictions.
 ''I don't know that we'll have a very big voice'' on the federal level, as new guidelines are developed, Mr. Prentice said. ''The states tend to be a little more fluid.''
 Many other states have welcomed the reversal in federal policy, hoping for an infusion of research dollars.
 Stem cells may hold the key to treating conditions including spinal cord injuries and Alzheimer's disease. But harvesting the cells from human embryos destroys them. 
 The Georgia bill comes as new federal guidelines for stem cell research are under development. But state legislators said the timing was coincidental. Bills had to be approved by at least one house this week to have a chance of becoming law. 
 Critics said the bill, which is opposed by the state university system, patient groups and fertility clinics, would hamper the bioscience sector, one of the brighter spots in Georgia's faltering economy. Georgia has put an emphasis on attracting biotechnology companies to the state, and Atlanta is to host 20,000 scientists at an international biotech convention in May. 
 The bill has not yet been taken up in the Georgia House, which is also controlled by Republicans. But even if it does not become law, its passage by the Senate makes recruitment more difficult, said Charles Craig, the president of Georgia Bio, an industry group. ''It's sending a signal that Georgia is anti-science,'' he said.
 The Roman Catholic Church, Southern Baptists and anti-abortion groups oppose the use of human embryos for research. 
 ''We allege that the emerging technologies are outstripping our political will for ethical restraint,'' said Daniel Becker, the president of Georgia Right to Life, a major proponent of the bill. ''They're proliferating at an exponential rate. It's very important that we establish ethical guidelines to prevent what we call 'Frankenscience.' ''
 Gov. Sonny Perdue, a Republican who has pushed the state's efforts to attract science and technology businesses, indicated he would support the bill.
 ''I can't in my conscience fathom that we would create human embryos to be used in scientific research,'' Mr. Perdue told reporters on Friday. ''That's where Georgia draws the line.''
 After President Bush banned federal financing of research on new stem cell lines in 2001, states developed their own policies that varied widely. About a dozen enacted laws affirming that embryonic stem cell research was legal, and a handful even allocated state money for research. Several states, including Louisiana and Oklahoma, banned embryonic stem cell research outright, while others limited it. 
 The bill that passed the Georgia Senate was not nearly as restrictive as Georgia Right to Life wished. It was filed as a sprawling bill that took on both the fertility industry and stem cell research. It defined an embryo as a ''biological human being who is not the property of any person or entity,'' limited the number of embryos that a woman could have implanted and forbade the destruction of unused embryos or their donation to science. It included criminal penalties.
 But people undergoing fertility treatments raised a loud protest, said Sean Tipton, a spokesman for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, and Senate leaders removed several of those provisions from the bill.
 The much shorter version that passed does not specify penalties or address the fate of unused embryos, as long as they were created for the purpose of procreation.

HEADLINE: Japan Vows More Spending, Backing American Stance

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER and HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
The Japanese government promised on Friday to provide another round of spending to help its economy, the second largest in the world, emerge from a recession.
 The pledge came on the eve of a weekend meeting of finance officials from the Group of 20 nations, which are split over the need for additional spending. 
 The United States and Britain have been pressing other nations to step up stimulus measures, while continental Europe has instead favored an overhaul of financial market regulation.
 The position of deeply indebted Japan has been unclear, but Friday's renewed pledges put Japan in the camp of the United States, sharpening a possible face-off with Europe when finance officials meet outside London this weekend.
 Kaoru Yosano, the finance minister, said in Tokyo before leaving for the G-20 meeting that he hoped Japan would have its spending plan in place in time for the summit meeting in April.
 Mr. Yosano said he ''intended to voice his strong approval'' for a call by the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, for nations to start stimulus measures equivalent to 2 percent of their gross domestic products.
 Prime Minister Taro Aso's popularity has hit a low ahead of national elections later this year. His ruling Liberal Democratic Party risks losing power, and Japan's flailing economy is partly to blame.
 Japan's economy slid into a recession last year as global demand for its export goods slumped. The economy contracted 12.1 percent on an annualized basis during the last quarter of 2008, according to revised government statistics released this week. 
 The government has already announced spending programs worth about $100 billion and other steps to ease the financial squeeze that many companies there face.
 Other measures include purchases of commercial paper, a type of short-term corporate debt, by the central bank, as well as a decision, announced Friday, to inject 121 billion yen, or $1.2 billion, into three regional banks.
 Still, many economists have criticized the government's policy action to date as inadequate and as dominated by political posturing ahead of the elections.
 Mounting evidence in the last few weeks that the global slowdown is deeper and is likely to be more protracted than initially feared has heightened the debate about whether governments should focus first on better regulation or on emergency spending.
 Several European governments, notably Germany, are wary of the swelling debt they are accumulating and favor a more cautious approach.
 They argue that the time is not yet right for more spending or tax cuts, and that the focus for the time should be on regulatory improvement.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Governor Challenges Utah's Conservative Verities

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY 

 BODY:
Among Utah Republicans, who hold every statewide elected office and more than two-thirds of the State Legislature, Hamlet-like quests for purpose and direction are hardly the norm.
 But the norms are dead for Republicans here, something that was in plain view this week as lawmakers overhauled the state's formerly untouchable liquor law at the urging of Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr.
 The debate was about scrapping the state's one-of-a-kind system of regulating bars and restaurants in a bid to boost the economy. But bound up in it was a profound, ongoing dialog, led by Mr. Huntsman, about what the Republican Party should be about and who should lead it. 
 Similar discussions are flickering in other parts of the country, especially in Republican-controlled state capitals, as party members sort through their losses from November and the rippling repercussions the recession has had on many of the premises they have stood for.
 The soul-searching has also meant a star search for national party leaders. Some Republicans say that conservative politicians like Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, the party's vice-presidential nominee in November, will show the way forward, while others say the electoral map -- and the formula for future Republican victories -- was rewritten by President Obama's election, and that a kind of casting call is now under way for new voices. Mr. Huntsman is firmly in the camp that says Republicans must turn the page.
 ''It's like the world began in November,'' Mr. Huntsman, 48, a moderate second-term Republican with billionaire roots, intense personal popularity and obvious national ambitions, said in an interview in his office here. ''The old ethos world view -- all that's been decimated.''
 Mr. Huntsman's moderate views often put him out of step in his first term -- and sometimes made him ineffective as well -- with the deeply conservative Republican majorities in the State House and Senate. 
 But in the last six months, Mr. Huntsman has honed those differences to rapier sharpness as conservatives linked to the policies of former President George W. Bush have gone on the defensive.
 In addition to leading the fight to change the liquor law, he has embraced President Obama's stimulus plan, restated his support for a cap-and-trade system of carbon emissions and announced support for legislation that would provide civil unions for gay couples.
 State legislative leaders have gone along with Mr. Huntsman part of the way -- notably on overhauling the liquor law, which both houses approved on Thursday -- and dug in their heels on much of the rest. But Mr. Huntsman's message to his party has been unwavering: that practicality and real-world action, driven by changed circumstance, should be the measure of where the next generation of Republican leaders comes from. 
 The new Republican direction is not going to come out of Congress, he said, or ''empty rhetoric,'' but from a handful of Republican governors who must compete in a ''meritocracy of ideas'' that voters will sort out for themselves.
 ''The party will be well served by looking at some of these examples of success,'' Mr. Huntsman said, ''whether it's Louisiana or Minnesota or Vermont or California, where things are being done.''
 But as a mile-post marker on the Republican road less traveled in Utah, nothing comes close to Mr. Huntsman's challenge to the culture-drenched restrictions on alcohol, which he attacked as anachronistic. Mr. Huntsman is a practicing Mormon, as are most state legislators, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the state's dominant religion, advocates abstention from alcohol.
 The old law, reflecting that view, required anyone who walked into a bar to first buy a membership card to the bar's ''private club,'' which typically cost $10 to $15. Tourism and restaurant lobby groups complained for years, saying the law made the state seem unwelcoming to outsiders. 
 ''One of our economic pillars is travel and tourism,'' said Mr. Huntsman, whose family roots in Utah -- and family fortune in the Huntman Corporation, a chemical manufacturer -- made him prominent here long before he first ran for governor in 2004. ''And if that's going to be hampered by these jaded and old-fashioned views, then that's going to impact the cash register and therefore our ability to fund the things that most citizens care deeply about, like our schools.''
 Talk like that, at a time of economic pain and budget turmoil, gave the liquor proposal legs, and led to a compromise that would abolish the private club system while tightening rules intended to keep under-age drinkers out of the bars. It is the most sweeping overhaul of state alcohol law since the 1960s.
 In the end, politicians in both parties say the economy probably played as big a role as the governor's leadership.
 ''It's been a kindler, gentler session,'' said State Representative David Litvack, a Democrat from Salt Lake City and the minority leader in the House. ''Where we are economically has made a big difference.''
 But there are hints that Mr. Huntsman's message of moderation, especially given his popularity in the state, is resonating beyond the Legislature and drawing support among the broader population. 
 In February, for example, when the governor announced that he would support civil unions for gay couples, many politicians here braced for a backlash.
 Utah voters had approved an amendment to the State Constitution in 2004 banning same-sex marriage or anything that might approximate it, and one opinion poll by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research in January said 70 percent of Utahans still opposed civil unions. 
 But the backlash never developed. Indeed, after his announcement, a poll by Deseret News/KSL-TV found that two-thirds of respondents said their opinion of the governor had not changed or had become more positive because of his position on civil unions. Over all, the governor's approval rating had barely budged, with 80 percent of residents saying they thought he was doing a good job. 
 Numbers like that could bolster Mr. Huntsman's position in the next legislative fight with his party's most conservative elements.
 ''I do not think the base of the Republican Party of Utah has traveled with the governor -- at least not yet,'' said State Representative David Clark, a Republican from Santa Clara and the speaker of the House. ''He's clearly on a new frontier.''

HEADLINE: Minutiae? In This White House, Call It News

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It's been another busy few days for the Obama administration, which the news media has faithfully cataloged.
 The Politico broke the story that the president's aides sang ''Happy Birthday'' to the assistant press secretary, Nick Shapiro, and surprised him with a chocolate cake!
 The Wall Street Journal scooped the nugget that the White House Office of Management and Budget chief, Peter R. Orszag, likes Diet Coke! 
 The Washington Examiner reported that the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, was spotted ''getting money at the SunTrust Bank in the Safeway on the corner 17th St. and Corcoran St. NW.''
 Are any of these items newsworthy? (It's not as if the country is facing two wars and an economic crisis or anything.). Well, yes, they are -- a lot of Web sites, bloggers and Twitterers have deemed these developments so. While there has always been a hearty appetite for stories -- and trivia -- about the people in a new administration, today's White House press corps (competing for up-to-the-second news) has elevated the most banal doings to a coveted ''get.'' 
 ''It started as sort of a joke to treat official Washington as a celebrity culture,'' said Ana Marie Cox, who helped create the genre in starting the Web site Wonkette five years ago.
 ''Now it seems that a lot of the irony has been lost and the joke has turned real,'' adds Ms. Cox, who now blogs and Twitters about the White House for Air America.
 In the Obama era, even junior and largely anonymous White House aides have become minor sensations. To wit, Washington awoke Thursday morning to the news -- courtesy of Mike Allen's ''Playbook'' column in the Politico -- that the deputy White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, ''was in her pajamas'' the night before when her fiance made dinner for her and proposed marriage.
 On Wednesday, Reggie Love, Mr. Obama's personal aide, was declared the winner of The Huffington Post's ''Who's the White House's hottest employee?'' contest (not to be confused with the ''Hottest Obama'' contest that ran on Gawker.com in January in which Mr. Emanuel triumphed). Mr. Love barely prevailed over the speechwriting phenom Jon Favreau -- the buzz-cut, written-about-to-death Red Sox fan known around the White House as Favs.
 Early in the Bush administration, reporters churned out stories about how, for instance, the top aide Karen Hughes was having difficulty adjusting to Washington; eight years earlier, top Clinton aides like George Stephanopoulos and James Carville also drew a great deal of attention. 
 But it was generally not remarked upon in real time if Mr. Stephanopoulos was, say, sporting a new tie or if Mr. Carville was seen dining at the Monocle on Capitol Hill (as Mr. Axelrod was on Thursday night, The New York Times has learned).
 ''There is certainly a volume to this now that we've never seen before,'' said Anita Dunn, a top campaign aide to Mr. Obama, whose marriage to Mr. Obama's personal counsel, Bob Bauer, was fodder for a story in The Washington Post on Tuesday about how the Obama era has produced a new generation of ''power couples.'' The couple was photographed for the article in their home, with Mr. Bauer holding one of the family cats (Kinsey) on his lap. 
 With so much pressure to break the next big story about Malia Obama's dog allergies or Favs's dating life, reporters who cover the Obama White House say the environment can be especially stressful.
 ''I feel physically pelted by minutiae,'' said Julie Mason, a White House correspondent and blogger for The Washington Examiner. 
 But, yes, news consumers care about the minutiae, said Ms. Mason, a former White House reporter for The Houston Chronicle. ''When I talk to normal people, they want to know what these people are really like away from the camera,'' she said.
 White House officials have an admittedly ambivalent relationship with their quasi-celebrity. Some acknowledge a tension between living up to the administration's stated goal of being ''transparent'' and ''open'' while also following the Obama staff ethic of being understated, cool and modest.
 ''We have a culture here that abhors all of that,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, the administration's deputy communications director. 
 When told that The Times was working on an article about ''all of that,'' Mr. Pfeiffer suggested that it might ''get bumped off the front page by a story about the first lady's hair.'' This could be construed as a knock against The Times for running a front-page article last week about how Mr. Obama's hair is going gray.

HEADLINE: Republicans Split on Need To Offer Rival For Budget

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans are engaged in a highly coordinated political assault on President Obama's budget, but they are not so united when it comes to offering an alternative to the spending plan they have been shredding as irresponsible.
 Breaking with the House, Senate Republicans say they do not intend to offer a full counterproposal to Mr. Obama's sweeping $3.6 trillion spending blueprint, a decision that will spare them from outlining potentially painful decisions required to bring federal books more in line with their call to hold down spending, cut taxes and reduce the deficit. 
 ''The responsibility of the majority is to produce the budget,'' said Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, senior Republican on the Budget Committee, ''and we think it is more constructive to point out how we would improve their budget.'' 
 With a month to go before Congress is supposed to pass a budget resolution, Democrats say the absence of a competing Senate Republican plan makes Republican complaints about the Obama approach ring hollow. Would Republicans, they ask, continue to keep the costs of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan off the books? Account for the costly annual change to protect middle-class taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax? Set up a disaster fund to prepare for emergencies?
 ''They are long on criticism and short on a plan,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff. ''They have a communications strategy instead of an economic one.''
 House Republicans said they intended to deliver a comprehensive alternative to the Obama plan to show how they would respond to the federal government's deepening fiscal difficulties but were not ready to provide details.
 As they try to reassert themselves as guardians of fiscal discipline after their own years of deficit spending, Republicans have been providing a steady stream of complaints depicting Mr. Obama's plan as spending too much, taxing too much and borrowing too much. 
 The effort is being made with more than the usual level of cooperation between House and Senate Republicans, with Republican leaders of the two chambers appearing in tandem and lawmakers repeating their antibudget criticism almost as a mantra. 
 In contrast to the first weeks of the Obama presidency, the attacks are aimed squarely at Mr. Obama, whose popularity initially shielded him from Republican criticism.
 ''Republicans in the House and Senate, with some degree of cooperation and collaboration, are going to attempt to both challenge the assumptions and the content of the president's budget,'' said Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House.
 Democrats are trying to exploit the absence of a Republican alternative, creating a Web page with a clock counting the hours since the Obama budget was introduced on Feb. 26 with no Republican alternative put forth. It lampoons Republicans as the ''Party of No.'' 
 Some Republicans acknowledge that the constant repetition of their budget message could turn it stale in Washington, but they say such persistence is required to break through with the general public.
 With their majorities in the House and Senate lost, Republican leaders say that an effective communications strategy is their best hope. They say they have little ability to influence the legislative debate, particularly in the House, if Democrats are determined to press ahead with Mr. Obama's plan to take on health care, climate change, education, transportation and other major issues.
 ''As I told my colleagues, we don't have enough votes to legislate,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader. ''We are not in the majority. We are not kind-of in the minority; we are in a hole. They ought to get the idea out of their minds that they are legislators. But what they can be is communicators.'' 
 The House has a history in which the minority party and other coalitions have often proposed their own budgets to draw distinctions with the party in power. Senate Democrats have offered alternative budgets in the past, including one in 2001, the first year of the George W. Bush's presidency.
 Compared to Republicans in the Senate, it will be easier for those in the House to push forward a competing spending plan because so many of them represent conservative areas where cuts in federal spending are less of a political liability. 
 Senators have broader constituencies and a budget that meets Republican fiscal goals could be a difficult vote for some Republicans.
 House Republicans offered an alternative to Mr. Obama's economic stimulus that they said was less costly and created more jobs, though economists and others challenged the Republican economic assumptions and claims. Mr. Pence and Mr. Boehner said House Republicans believed they needed to propose their own budget to bolster the credibility of their criticisms of the Obama plan.
 ''It is incumbent for us to get out there and make sure people understand we have a better solution,'' Mr. Boehner said. 
 Republicans are taking a political risk in offering such relentless resistance to Mr. Obama's agenda, given his popularity and the gains Democrats made in Congress last year. 
 But they say they believe the public is becoming alarmed at the level of spending being pursued by Democrats. They intend to use the next month of budget debate to reinforce that impression.
 ''The question before the American people is whether the American family can afford the Democrats' spending, the Democrats' taxing and the Democrats' borrowing,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate. ''We have four weeks to make that case.''

HEADLINE: Obama Voices Optimism on the Economy

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama and his team sounded cautiously optimistic notes about the economy Friday as part of an accelerating campaign to project confidence that the nation can pull out of the downturn that has caused millions of jobs and trillions of dollars of wealth to vanish.
 Declaring himself ''confident about America,'' Mr. Obama hailed the ''the most productive workers on earth'' and ''some of the most innovative businesses on earth.'' His chief economic adviser cited ''modestly encouraging'' signs that consumer spending had stabilized. And on the fourth consecutive day in which the stock market posted a gain, the White House press secretary pointed to ''glimmers of hope'' that the economy could turn around. 
 After meeting with Paul A. Volcker, one of his top economic advisers, Mr. Obama said, ''There are a lot of individual families who are experiencing incredible pain and hardship right now.''
 ''But if we are keeping focused on all the fundamentally sound aspects of our economy,'' he added, ''all the outstanding companies, workers, all the innovation and dynamism in this economy, then we're going to get through this. And I'm very confident about that.''
 Mr. Obama actually came close to using the same language that helped doom the campaign of his Republican opponent, Senator John McCain, who was hammered by Democrats last year for declaring that ''the fundamentals of our economy are strong.'' Recognizing the danger in appearing too upbeat, however, the president and his advisers were careful to warn that recovery could take a long time.
 Still, after weeks of emphasizing the dire nature of the economic crisis in order to pressure Congress to act on his proposals, Mr. Obama has lately tried to calibrate the tone to inspire Americans rather than stoke their fears. In fact, Lawrence H. Summers, director of the president's National Economic Council, said in a speech Friday that there was an ''excess of fear.''
 The brighter mood matched the performance on Wall Street, where the market had its best week in four months. Mr. Summers even suggested that it was time for bargain hunters to buy, arguing that stocks were undervalued in a historic sense: adjusted for inflation, he noted, the Dow Jones industrial average earlier this week was at the same level as 43 years ago.
 ''While there could be many ways to question this calculation,'' he said, ''that the market would be at essentially the same level as it was in 1966 -- when there were no PCs, no Internet, no flexible manufacturing, no software industry, and when our work force was half and our net capital stock was a third of what it is today -- may be regarded by some as the sale of the century.''
 During a question-and-answer session after the speech, which he delivered at the Brookings Institution, Mr. Summers was asked what business leaders should do to stimulate recovery.
 ''While the problem was caused by excessive complacency and excessive optimism,'' he replied, ''what we need today is more optimism and more confidence.''
 Republicans jumped on the shifting tenor. The Republican National Committee sent out an e-mail message comparing the condition of the economy today against where it was when Mr. McCain spoke of fundamental soundness last September. 
 When the Democrats ridiculed Mr. McCain for that remark, the Dow was at 10,917, compared with 7,170 at the market's opening on Friday, the Republicans pointed out. Unemployment is at 8.1 percent, compared with 6.2 percent in September, and the national debt is $1.35 trillion higher.
 The office of Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, mocked administration officials for ''changing their economic message.'' In a statement, Mr. Boehner's office pointed to comments he made Thursday complaining about Mr. Obama's expansive economic plans. ''This mountain of debt that's being built this year,'' the congressman said then, ''will crush our ability to get out of this crisis and to get our economy moving again.''
 Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Obama was not unrealistically sanguine about the depth of the crisis.
 ''I don't think the president would stand up in front of you or a group of Americans and say things are great,'' Mr. Gibbs said. ''But the president is also confident and hopeful that the steps that we're taking will move us down that path.''
 Asked to assess economic conditions now, Mr. Gibbs said, ''Somewhere between 'not as bad as they could be' and 'not as good as they need to be.' ''

HEADLINE: Citing Economy Worries, Argentine Leader Seeks Early Vote

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO and VINOD SREEHARSHA; Alexei Barrionuevo reported from Sao Paulo, and Vinod Sreeharsha from Buenos Aires.

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil 

 BODY:
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina said on Friday that she would ask her country's Congress to move up elections by four months, saying she wanted to give Argentines less to worry about in the face of the worsening global financial crisis. 
 The move, if approved before March 28, would mean congressional elections would be held on June 28 instead of the scheduled date, Oct. 25. 
 The proposal, Mrs. Kirchner said in a speech in the Patagonian province of Chubut, would allow Argentines to ''surmount the pitfalls in elections and everything that elections normally demand.'' Argentines, she said, ''need tranquillity.''
 Analysts assailed the move as a show of weakness and an attempt by Mrs. Kirchner and her husband, former President Nestor Kirchner, who has headed the Peronist party since early last year, to have a vote before economic and political conditions deteriorate further. A recent exodus of Peronist leaders, most notably Carlos Reutemann, a once-loyal senator from Santa Fe Province, has threatened the Kirchners' already tenuous grip on power.
 Mrs. Kirchner has seen her popular support fall to under 40 percent in various job-approval surveys since a protracted battle with farmers over export taxes last year hurt the government's support in rural areas. And her decisions to nationalize the country's main airline and take over billions of dollars in private pension funds to offset falling commodity prices have driven away foreign investors. 
 Those extra funds have given the government enough to pay more than $18 billion in foreign debts this year, economists said. But declining industrial production and falling exports because of the global economic crisis could make it tougher for the Kirchners later in the year, economists said.
 The proposal could help secure a crucial victory for Mr. Kirchner, who is considering running for Congress himself in the important battleground province of Buenos Aires.
 A loss by the Kirchners' Peronist bloc in the congressional elections could force Mrs. Kirchner to resign, said Daniel Kerner, a Latin American analyst at Eurasia Group, a risk management consultancy in New York. ''The government is obviously turning the election into a plebiscite on the Kirchners, as a means to force a resolution of existing political conflicts,'' he said.
 The analysts also said the Kirchners might have been trying to undercut Mauricio Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires, who has called for early citywide elections. Mr. Macri is widely viewed as a potential rival to Mrs. Kirchner in 2011.
 Graciela Romer, a political analyst in Buenos Aires, said the Kirchners were gambling that with the opposition fragmented and in disarray, their popular support would be sufficient to win the elections. Ms. Romer added that the effects of the economic crisis ''can only hurt them if they wait until October.''

HEADLINE: In Stem Cell Debate, Moral Suasion Comes Up Short

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
Almost no one was surprised this week when President Obama lifted restrictions on stem cell research that involved the destruction of human embryos. Even jaded Washington watchers are adjusting to the idea that this is a president with an eerie determination to do exactly what he said he would do during his campaign.
 Those who approve such research applauded Mr. Obama's action. (''Fantastic,'' said one stem cell scientist on PBS.) Those who disapprove condemned it. (''Deadly,'' said an anti-abortion leader in The New York Times.) But some commentary focused at least as much on the nature of the president's moral argument as on the specific conclusions he reached.
 When it comes to the controversy over human embryonic stem cell research, moral argument has not been much in evidence. The president spoke of a popular consensus in favor of it reached ''after much discussion, debate and reflection.'' That is a kindly description of the hype, exaggeration and denunciation that have dominated the controversy. 
 Politicians, scientists and Hollywood stars conjured up visions of cures of biblical proportions. One member of the House of Representatives equated opposition to embryonic stem cell research with refusing ''a cure for your child's cancer.'' Another called such opposition ''a sentence of death of millions of Americans.'' 
 Not long after the death of former President Ronald Reagan, his younger son, Ron, told delegates at the 2004 Democratic convention to imagine ''your own personal biological repair kit standing by at the hospital.'' 
 ''Sound like magic?'' Mr. Reagan said. ''Welcome to the future of medicine.'' 
 Scientists who knew better kept quiet. 
 ''People need a fairy tale,'' Ronald D. G. McKay, a stem cell researcher at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, explained to The Washington Post in 2004. 
 Recently, Nicholas Wade in the Science section of The New York Times summed this all up: ''Members of Congress and advocates for fighting diseases have long spoken of human embryonic stem cell research as if it were a sure avenue to quick cures for intractable afflictions. Scientists have not publicly objected to such high-flown hopes, which have helped fuel new sources of grant money like the $3 billion initiative in California for stem cell research.''
 ''In private, however,'' the article continued, ''many researchers have projected much more modest goals for embryonic stem cells.'' 
 On Monday, Mr. Obama certainly avoided the worst of this recent history. He warned twice against overstating the promise of stem cell research, even if he did envision ''a day when words like 'terminal' and 'incurable' are finally retired from our vocabulary.'' 
 More important, he acknowledged that ''thoughtful and decent people'' opposed this research, and he claimed to ''understand their concerns.'' His own view was that ''with proper guidelines and strict oversight, the perils can be avoided.'' 
 What were those ''concerns'' that Mr. Obama understood or those ''perils'' that he would avoid? The president did not say. So one could object that his moral argument stopped in mid-air. How can one evaluate what he called ''a difficult and delicate balance'' when it is not clear exactly what is being balanced? 
 The more challenging objection -- again, not to the president's specific stance on embryonic stem cell research, but to the general form of his argument -- went directly to a theme running through his announcement and echoed in enthusiastic comments from research proponents: 
 Science, it was said, should be isolated from politics, from ideology, from dogma, from religion. 
 Sounds good if all one means is that the current administration will treat science with more respect than many people believe its predecessor did. Sounds good if all one means by politics is partisan maneuvering or by ideology, dogma and religion, some form of blind belief unwilling to engage alternative viewpoints. 
 But these words frequently function as weapons. One person's ideology can be someone else's political philosophy or even morality. One person's dogma can be someone else's self-evident truths. And politics is the way that people decide how they will live together, by what moral standards and to what ends. 
 Historians, sociologists and scientists themselves have generated a small library of books demonstrating how much of science has been driven and shaped by politics and ideology -- and economics, too -- all the while imagining that it was value-free, ''just the facts,'' as Sergeant Friday and perhaps Mr. Obama would say. 
 Science has certainly developed safeguards to isolate its work from distorting influences. The danger is that those safeguards, like antibodies run amok, can also isolate it from morality. 
 In a provocative article in online magazine Slate, William Saletan, a supporter of embryonic stem cell research, noted the ''mirror image'' of some research advocacy by pointing to Karl Rove's accusation that Mr. Obama was endangering the country by drawing a sharp moral line against certain methods of interrogation. 
 ''Proponents of embryo research are insisting that because we're in a life-and-death struggle -- in this case, a scientific struggle -- anyone who impedes that struggle by renouncing effective tools is irrational and irresponsible,'' Mr. Saletan wrote. ''The war on disease is like the war on terror. Either you're with science or you're against it.'' 
 To label the opposition to embryonic stem cell research as ''ideology,'' Mr. Saletan suggests, is to ''forget the moral problem.'' To pursue this research is a moral choice. Not to pursue it is a moral choice. And moral choices of this nature properly wind up in the political arena. 
 Two days after Mr. Obama's announcement, The Times ran three science-related articles. One was about stem cell researchers worried that any new federal financing might prove insufficient. It also ran an article about a prolific medical researcher who admitted fabricating research that just happened to support the products of the pharmaceutical company underwriting the research. Both were reminders of how much science is affected by big money. 
 And the paper ran a Page 1 article about European nations' debating whether surgical or chemical castration is an effective, humane and legitimate treatment to rehabilitate violent sex offenders. No one can read that article and imagine that this is simply a scientific question, to be resolved by medical scientists on their own terms, rather than one that is profoundly moral and political. 
 Is that any less true when it comes to not only human embryonic stem cell research but also a host of other ethically fraught, knotty scientific questions now challenging Americans?

HEADLINE: U.S. Has the Capacity to Prosper, Obama and Volcker Say

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As the markets clung to the gains of the past few days, President Obama reiterated his optimism for the long haul on Friday, while warning that a lot of work lies ahead to unclog credit streams and rebuild the economy. 
 ''We are spending every day working through how to get credit flowing again, so that businesses large and small, as well as consumers, are able to obtain credit and we can get this economy moving again,'' the president said after meeting at the White House with his economic recovery advisory board, headed by Paul A. Volcker.
 But the president said that free-flowing credit is only one treatment for economic ailments a long time in the making. Others, he said, are the just-enacted stimulus package and, more broadly, ''some long-term financial regulatory work,'' adding that Mr. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman, has a range of ideas about the regulatory issue.
 Moreover, the president said, the United States cannot act in isolation, but must ''do some coordination with other countries.''
 ''How do we eliminate systemic risks, so that this kind of problem never happens again?'' Mr. Obama asked rhetorically.
 One way, he said, is to lay the foundation for a post-bubble economy, through lower health care costs, a better education system, cleaner energy and other oft-mentioned but elusive goals. ''The days when we are going to be able to grow this economy just on an overheated housing market or people spending, maxing out on their credit cards -- those days are over,'' Mr. Obama said.
 Mr. Volcker, appearing with the president, said there were ''big economic problems behind the financial system'' that could not be deferred, even while more immediate crises were being tackled, a point the president has made repeatedly. 
 The president said that America's capacity is undiminished, and that it has ''the most dynamic free-market economy on earth.'' But for the moment, he said, ''we've got some significant problems that have been building, built up over a long period of time.''
 The president's chief economic adviser, Lawrence Summers, made some of the same points earlier Friday in a speech at the Brookings Institution here. Asserting that the United States had gone ''from an excess of greed to an excess of fear,'' Mr. Summers said the transition was the same kind that President Franklin D. Roosevelt had in mind in 1933 when he declared that ''the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'' 
 ''Our problems were not made in a day or a month or a year, and they will not be solved quickly,'' Mr. Summers said. ''But there is one enduring lesson of the history of financial crises: they all end.''

HEADLINE: A Return to the Classics in Sydney

BYLINE: By DEBRA A. KLEIN

 BODY:
THE directions were straightforward, but my taxi was lost anyway, backtracking a rain-slicked street of converted warehouses in the shadow of Sydney's Harbour Bridge. Darkened doorways and empty sidewalks added to the period-film-set feeling. I expected to see Russell Crowe in rolled-up shirtsleeves outside the brick-fronted buildings, but Walsh Bay is more Kidman chic than rough-and-tumble Cinderella Man. Tucked in a lightly trafficked district a stone's throw from the Rocks tourist enclave, Hickson Road takes a hairpin turn past the Park Hyatt Sydney through a lifeless streetscape with more stark art installations than shops selling kangaroo-themed souvenirs.
Walsh Bay's docks teemed with desperate longshoremen looking for work during the Great Depression, then fell into disrepair. About a decade ago, developers converted the wharves into million-dollar apartments that Sydney's business elite snapped up within days. (Yes, Nicole really did sleep here.) The district was renamed the Hungry Mile as an homage to the unemployed stevedores, and the architecture retains vestiges of its working dockside past.
Yet with theaters, an art gallery and a rash of new and inviting restaurants, visitors needn't go hungry -- for food or culture -- today. 
Restaurant Arras (24 Hickson Road; 61-2-9252-6285; www.restaurant-arras.com.au) embodies the neighborhood's rustic-industrial, understated feel. Tasteful black plaques flank plain glass doors and there are bars on the windows, a far cry from the dramatic fiery sconces or foot-high lettering beckoning diners in nearby Circular Quay.
Inside the former wool store, muted beige fabrics, exposed brick and gossamer curtains whisper fine dining. A rough-hewn wood staircase to nowhere is bolted to the ceiling as a reminder of the building's historic pedigree. The chef, Adam Humphrey, says he wanted to bring the flavors of his youth in Yorkshire to Sydney.
Mr. Humphrey and Lovaine Allen, his partner in the kitchen (and in real life), searched for years for a space with history, and picked Walsh Bay because the neighborhood, like their menu, mixes the old and the new. They take British standbys and, as they put it, drag them into the 21st century.
English pea pods and shoots are served in a frothy ''milkshake'' alongside snapper on a black slate scattered with blue blossoms (42.50 Australian dollars, or about $26.50 at 1.60 to the U.S. dollar); iconic English Licorice Allsorts become jellies, parfaits and custards in their hands. Crisp mulled wine sorbet with chunks of litchi and peaches not only links an entree of hearty marinated portobello mushrooms pressed into a cube (32 dollars) to the cheese trolley (29 dollars), but is also a nod to the traditional English Christmas beverage (usually served hot).
English clues are even woven into the food surreptitiously. Mr. Humphrey makes a powdery dip for the spiced quail and deep fried sauce appetizer (27 dollars) from sugar mixed with a crumbled English tea cake called parkin, a Yorkshire staple, and smokes the birds in Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea. ''We aim to make people realize that British food is not dull and insipid,'' Mr. Humphrey said.
Arras's guests are local foodies, not camera-toting tourists. On a recent visit, laughter at the next table -- young chefs on a night off -- stopped only for bites of a shared tomato terrine (25.50). Another group was so busy chattering they barely seemed to notice the petit four platter: rows of tartlets, chocolate pyramids and rum raisin fudge, a collection that also riffed on Mr. Humphrey's favorite childhood sweets.
Restaurant Arras reflects a micro trend in Sydney dining, a retreat from Mod Oz and return to the flavors of the past. Instead of amping up Australian foods with cross-cultural cues from world travels, chefs are redrawing culinary borders and cooking Old World mainstays in new ways.
Three miles away, in the Crows Nest neighborhood, the British chef Matthew Kemp, who gained a reputation for European fare at Restaurant Balzac, opened his year-old Burlington Bar and Dining (6 Burlington Street; 61-2-9439-7888; www.burlingtonbardining.com.au) as a neighborhood bistro where he demonstrates the versatility of old recipes. ''Traditional dishes, when executed with precision and care, are timeless classics and can be used for centuries,'' Mr. Kemp said in a recent e-mail interview. The only overtly Australian element in the bistro may be the native waratah flower silhouettes on the cocoa-colored walls. On the plate, Mr. Kemp serves British comfort food like pork cheek, ear and ham hock, but in a modern terrine (12 or 18 dollars).
Set back from the street in a leafy oasis between downtown Sydney and Bondi, the popular Bronte Road Bistro (282 Bronte Road; 61-2-9389-3028; www.bronteroadbistro.com) makes French staples accessible for a new age. Instead of captains and cloches, there are casual spaces: wicker chairs on a patio and a sun-dappled greenhouse, where diners enjoy duck rillette appetizers (15 dollars) and steak frites or grilled fish Provencal entrees (26 dollars) prepared by the chef Dave Pegrum, who was formerly head chef at Tetsuya's.
A 10-minute ferry ride from Circular Quay in Mosman, Derek Baker's unassuming bistro, Alchemy 731 (731 Military Road; 61-2-9968-3731; www.alchemy731.com.au), showcases old English recipes served in new ways. ''People look at Britain and don't know what British food is and don't understand how deep the tradition of food goes, how we rear the cattle, farm the fields,'' Mr. Baker told me via e-mail message. Bread, butter, jams and ice cream are all made in-house. His classic British rack of lamb and shepherd's pie (34 dollars) has a twist. The lamb shoulder is braised, shaved and formed into a crepinette; the shepherd's pie is in a beaker. For dessert, the English trifle is made with tropical fruit (17 dollars).
The spare metropolitan decor and crowds of drinkers at the at-long-last reopened Beresford Hotel (354 Bourke Street; 61-2-9357-1111; www.theberesford.com.au) belie the adjacent trattoria's traditional culinary roots. The chef, Danny Russo, helped found the Council of Italian Restaurants in Australia, dedicated to re-establishing the boundaries of authentic Italian cooking. He updates rustic classics from his family's home region, Basilicata, with fresh produce, as in a rabbit leg with radicchio (32 dollars) and pan-fried veal sweetbreads with apple puree (19 dollars). Diners looking for an authentic Sunday meal can share homemade pasta and a roast at the afternoon Family Feast (45 dollars per person).
The room is in Australia, but close your eyes and you can taste Europe on the plate.

HEADLINE: Discussing Lehman, Pashto, Bush and, Oh, Yes, a Murder Trial

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD

 BODY:
There were many eyebrow-raising revelations at the trial of Mazoltuv Borukhova, a Queens internist, and her relative Mikhail Mallayev, who were found guilty on Tuesday of conspiring to kill her husband in front of her 4-year-old daughter. But some had less to do with the murder than with the financial crisis and other national anxieties.
The trial played out amid global financial turmoil, and the verdicts came down the day after Bernard L. Madoff agreed to plead guilty to running the largest Ponzi scheme in Wall Street history. But it was two weeks earlier that courtroom wags noticed how the curious story of Mr. Mallayev might provide clues to the roots of the financial meltdown, and the epidemic of bad loans that started it.
Mr. Mallayev, 51, is an Atlanta real estate developer who prosecutors say freelanced as a hit man. His lawyer protested that he was a wealthy man with no reason to kill for $20,000, the amount prosecutors said Dr. Borukhova paid. Prosecutors then introduced bank records showing that he was more than $2.5 million in debt. 
A few years ago, spectators might have tuned out the details. But given the nation's financial predicament, they were the talk of the courtroom.
Bank officials testified that Mr. Mallayev -- a Bukharian Jewish immigrant from Uzbekistan, like Dr. Borukhova and her estranged husband, Daniel Malakov -- owed more than $200,000 in 2007, for taxes, credit card debt and a loan on a Mazda. Still, Washington Mutual gave him a $1.5 million home equity loan. After missing five monthly payments of nearly $9,000 each, he asked the bank for $500,000 more. Absolutely not, the bank said.
Instead, it lent him $375,000. Meanwhile, Bank of America separately lent him $250,000.
''It's no wonder we're in the mess we're in,'' said Alla Lupyan, a court interpreter.
Mr. Mallayev's lawyer said that he owned land as collateral, and protested that $20,000 would have covered just two payments.
At that rate, other observers noted, he would have had to kill 100 people to get out of debt.
Parsing Words
The following week, the national challenge that came to mind was the difficulty in translating the languages of global hot spots.
Dr. Borukhova had secretly recorded a conversation with Mr. Mallayev in a car. She testified that it was about a real estate deal, but prosecutors suspected otherwise. The two had spoken in Russian and Bukhori, the dialect of Bukharian Jews from Uzbekistan.
Bukhori is similar to Farsi, with Hebrew and Russian mixed in. In the small Bukharian community, it was hard to find a translator who had not taken sides in the case.
So the task fell to Mansur Alyadinov, an F.B.I. translator who testified that he worked on criminal cases and matters of national security. He is fluent in Russian but not Bukhori. He translated the recording, he said, using his knowledge of Dari, a Farsi-based language spoken in Afghanistan, and various dictionaries.
(In a tantalizing tangent out of ''Charlie Wilson's War,'' Mr. Alyadinov explained that he learned Dari during five years as a prisoner of war in Afghanistan, where he was captured while fighting in the Soviet Army. In 1988, the United States government -- he did not say which agency -- flew him to the United States, where he defected.)
It was not surprising, the peanut gallery noted, that the F.B.I. could not immediately produce a fluent Bukhori speaker. After all, the lack of translators of Arabic and Pashto -- more common and more vital to national security -- is a much-cited obstacle in the fight against Islamic extremists.
Mr. Alyadinov struggled with the dialect, and there were even debates over his interpretation of Russian.
Dressed in just the kind of gray suit and large glasses that moviegoers would expect from an unsung member of his agency, he was able to pick out some interesting tidbits: ''account,'' ''bank,'' ''efficient work.'' But the juiciest -- ''remembrance for the deceased'' -- turned out, it seemed, to be a mistaken interpretation of Bukhori, a reference to a relative named Ochil.
Mr. Alyadinov also said Mr. Mallayev asked in Russian, ''Are you going to make me happy?'' suggesting some financial or even sexual favor.
Yet the phrase the translator heard as ''Ty obraduyesh?'' or ''Will you make happy?'' sounded more like ''Ty padayesh,'' or ''Are you falling?'' which has one fewer syllable. And the word ''me'' -- ''menya'' -- was not audible.
Dr. Borukhova said ''falling'' was Bukharian Jewish slang for getting out of a car. That struck several Russian speakers as unlikely. Dr. Borukhova's relatives said it was common knowledge in their community. Not surprisingly, her slain husband's relatives said it was not.
What, No Brawling?
Stephen G. Murphy was perhaps the only observer who found the trial lacking in drama. ''Boring,'' he called it, but then, for a man who has been compared to the pitchman for Crazy Eddie, a trial is not a trial without screaming lawyers and courtroom brawls.
Nonetheless, Mr. Murphy, a defense lawyer in the infamous Howard Beach case in 1987 -- his client was the only one acquitted of three white youths accused of beating a black man who then ran into traffic and was killed -- sat through a morning of the trial while waiting for his wife, who was at a nearby salon. (''Women and their hair,'' he lamented.)
Mr. Murphy, 65, said the suspects were lightweights compared to an elderly Albanian he once represented, who, when a young man threw a garbage can lid at his house, shot him six times and returned to sleep before the police arrived.
He could not understand why Dr. Borukhova did not say that she had complained to Mr. Mallayev about her husband and that he must have devised the killing on his own. ''If he's going to go down, why go down with him?'' he asked.
And don't even talk to him about Mr. Mallayev, who used a silencer made from a bleach bottle that blew off at the scene, bearing his fingerprints.
''You've got to be a moron,'' Mr. Murphy said loudly, seemingly incapable of whispering. ''You need to put grooves in the gun and grooves on the silencer. Screw it on. Put the muzzle in a newspaper so you don't see any flash.''
Justice Robert J. Hanophy, who typically throws out anyone who peeps, shouted at him in mock anger, ''Murph!''
''Thank you, judge,'' he said, and continued on a new line of soliloquy -- this time complaining about how President George W. Bush handled the war in Iraq.

HEADLINE: At a Pier to Be Redone, Gay Youth Seek a Haven

BYLINE: By JOSEPH HUFF-HANNON

 BODY:
STANDING in front of a banquet hall in Greenwich Village packed with more than 100 young people on Monday evening, Glo Ross tailored her pitch to the audience.
''So we all just went on a date with the Hudson River Park Trust,'' said Ms. Ross, who is an organizer with Fierce, a group of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender minority youths. ''But you know, we're a little fed up.'' 
The response was wild applause and hooting from the overflow crowd in the gallery, where white columns were wrapped with pink ribbons.
The trust oversees the planning, construction and operation of Hudson River Park and all the piers that run from Battery Park to 59th Street. Members of Fierce are particularly concerned about Pier 40, a massive but dilapidated structure that juts into the Hudson River where West Houston Street meets the West Side Highway.
Since the pier sits just south of Pier 45 at Christopher Street, long a gathering spot for youths like the members of Fierce, many of them say that the trust hasn't always paid them much mind in the deliberations about what kind of redevelopment plans are appropriate for the pier.
Fierce and the Urban Justice Center, a public-interest legal group, are asking that any plan include a 24-hour youth center. Such a center, they hope, would offer services like job training, transitional housing, recreation and safe space.
''The pier is just the place to be, to hang out and be who you are,'' said Tiffany Browne, an 18-year-old budding photographer from Brownsville, Brooklyn, who arrived with a big camera swinging from her neck. ''I spent all last summer down there.''
As Ms. Browne darted off to snap some photos, a 24-year-old who calls himself Mango chimed in with a similar story.
''Where I'm from in Harlem, you don't hear too much about L.G.B.T. issues,'' he said. ''Down here, it's our only place to hang out, to relax.''
Members of Fierce acknowledge that a youth center won't be an easy sell, especially in the current economic climate; last year, $5 million was cut from the budgets of organizations like Fierce. But since the trust may be eligible for federal stimulus money, advocates for the young people hope that their voices will be heard when it comes to development.
But the trust has considered previous proposals that included a youth center and has ruled that they would not work, primarily for financial reasons. Officials at the trust would not comment on their larger development plans, but they did say that any stimulus money would likely be directed to basic repairs at Pier 40.
''There are a bunch of pilings that need to be replaced,'' said Lee Silberstein, a spokesman for the trust. ''The first order of business is really to make sure the pier doesn't collapse.''

HEADLINE: Where Education and Assimilation Collide

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

 BODY:
WOODBRIDGE, Va. -- Walking the halls of Cecil D. Hylton High School outside Washington, it is hard to detect any trace of the divisions that once seemed fixtures in American society.
Two girls, a Muslim in a headscarf and a strawberry blonde in tight jeans, stroll arm in arm. A Hispanic boy wearing a Barack Obama T-shirt gives a high-five to a black student with glasses and an Afro. The lanky homecoming queen, part Filipino and part Honduran, runs past on her way to band practice. The student body president, a son of Laotian refugees, hangs fliers about a bake sale.
But as old divisions vanish, waves of immigration have fueled new ones between those who speak English and those who are learning how.
Walk with immigrant students, and the rest of Hylton feels a world apart. By design, they attend classes almost exclusively with one another. They take separate field trips. And they organize separate clubs. 
''I am thankful to my teachers because the little bit of English I am able to speak, I speak because of them,'' Amalia Raymundo, from Guatemala, said during a break between classes. But, she added, ''I feel they hold me back by isolating me.''
Her best friend, Jhosselin Guevara, also from Guatemala, joined in. ''Maybe the teachers are trying to protect us,'' she said. ''There are people who do not want us here at all.''
In the last decade, record numbers of immigrants, both legal and illegal, have fueled the greatest growth in public schools since the baby boom. The influx has strained many districts' budgets and resources and put classrooms on the front lines of America's battles over whether and how to assimilate the newcomers and their children.
Inside schools, which are required to enroll students regardless of their immigration status and are prohibited from even asking about it, the debate has turned to how best to educate them.
Hylton High, where a reporter for The New York Times spent much of the past year, is a vivid laboratory. Like thousands of other schools across the country, it has responded to the surge of immigrants by channeling them into a school within a school. It is, in effect, a contemporary form of segregation that provides students learning English intensive support to meet rising academic standards -- and it also helps keep the peace.
In a nation where most students learning English lag behind other groups by almost every measure, Hylton's program stands out for its students' high test scores and graduation rates. However, at this ordinary American high school, in an ordinary American suburb at a time of extraordinary upheaval, those achievements come with considerable costs.
The calm in the hallways belies resentments simmering among students who barely know one another. They readily label one another ''stupid'' or ''racist.'' The tensions have at times erupted into walkouts and cafeteria fights, including one in which immigrant students tore an American flag off the wall and black students responded by shouting, ''Go back to your own country!''
Hylton's faculty has been torn over how to educate its immigrant population. Some say the students are unfairly coddled and should be forced more quickly into the mainstream. And even those who support segregating students admit to soul-searching over whether the program serves the school's needs at the expense of immigrant students, who are relentlessly drilled and tutored on material that appears on state tests but get rare exposure to the kinds of courses, demands or experiences that might better prepare them to move up in American society.
''This is hard for us,'' said Carolyn Custard, Hylton's principal. ''I'm not completely convinced we're right. I don't want them to be separated, but at the same time, I want them to succeed.''
Education officials classify some 5.1 million students in the United States -- 1 in 10 of all those enrolled in public schools -- as English language learners, a 60 percent increase from 1995 to 2005.
Researchers give many causes for the gaps between them and other groups. Perhaps most paradoxical, they say, is that a nation that prides itself on being a melting pot has yet to reach agreement on the best way to teach immigrant students.
In recent years, students learning English have flooded into small towns and suburban school districts that have little experience with international diversity. Meanwhile, teachers and administrators have come under increasing pressure to meet the requirements of the federal No Child Left Behind Act, which links every school's financing and its teachers' jobs to student performance on standardized tests.
The challenges have only intensified with a souring economy and deepening anger over illegal immigration, provoking many Americans to questionwhether those living here unlawfully should be educated at all.
Political Responses
Across the country, politics is never far from the schoolhouse door. Arizona, California and Massachusetts adopted English-only education policies that limited bilingual services. By contrast, school districts in Georgia and Utah have recruited teachers from Mexico to work with their swelling Latin American populations.
Near Washington, officials in Frederick County, Md., floated the idea of challenging federal law by requiring students to disclose whether they are in the country legally, an idea also proposed by the authorities in Culpeper County, Va.
Then there is Hylton High School's home county, Prince William. What was once a mostly white, middle-class suburb 35 miles southwest of the nation's capital has been transformed by a construction boom into a traffic-choked sprawl of townhouses and strip malls where Latinos are the fastest-growing group.
Neighborhood disputes led the county to enact laws intended to drive illegal immigrants away. White and black families with the means to buy their way out of the turmoil escaped to more affluent areas. Hispanic families, feeling threatened or just plain unwelcome, were torn between those who had legal status and those who did not. Many fled.
By last March, educators reported that at least 759 immigrant students had dropped out of county schools. Hylton, whose 2,200 student population is almost equal parts white, black and Latino and comes from working-class apartment complexes and upscale housing developments, was one of the hardest hit.
The school's program for English learners -- a predominantly Latino group that includes students from 32 countries who speak 25 languages -- is directed by Ginette Cain, 61, who says she was inspired to teach immigrant students because she was once one herself.
Petite with a shock of red hair, the daughter of a lumberjack and a cook, Ms. Cain was the first in her French-Canadian family to master English when they arrived in Vermont in the 1950s. She served as a bridge between her parents and their new homeland, helping them in meetings with landlords, teachers, doctors and bill collectors.
The hostilities that today's immigrants face, Ms. Cain said, have shaken her faith in bridges.
''I used to tell my students that they had to stay in school,'' Ms. Cain said, ''because eventually the laws would change, they would become citizens of this country, and they needed their diplomas so they could make something of themselves as Americans.''
''I don't tell them that anymore,'' she continued. ''Now I tell them they need to get their diplomas because an education will help them no matter what side of the border they're on.''
A Crash Program
It was crunch time at Hylton High: 10 minutes until the bell, two weeks before state standardized tests, and a classroom full of blank stares suggesting that Ms. Cain still had a lot of history to cover to get her students ready.
The question hanging in the air: ''What is the name for a time of paranoia in the United States that was sparked by the Bolshevik Revolution?''
''What's that?'' Delmy Gomez, a junior from El Salvador, said with a grimace that caused his classmates to burst into laughter.
The question might have stumped plenty of high school students. But for Ms. Cain's pupils, it might as well have been nuclear physics.
Freda Conteh had missed long stretches of school in war-torn Sierra Leone. Noemi Caballero, from Mexico, filled notebooks with short stories and poetry in Spanish, but struggled to compose simple sentences in English.
Nuwan Gamage, from Sri Lanka, was distracted by working two jobs to support himself because he found it difficult to live with his mother and her American husband after spending most of his life apart from her. And Edvin Estrada, a Guatemalan, worried about a brother in the Marines, headed off for duty in some undisclosed hot spot.
Few of these students had heard of the Pilgrims, much less the history of Thanksgiving. Idioms like ''easy as pie'' and ''melting pot'' were lost on them. They knew little of the American Revolution, much less the Bolshevik.
''American students come to school with a lot of cultural knowledge that other teachers assume they don't have to explain because their kids get it from growing up in this country, watching television or surfing the Internet,'' Ms. Cain said. ''I can't assume any of that.''
Education experts estimate that it takes the average learner of English at least two years of study to hold conversations, and five to seven years to write essays, understand a novel or explain scientific processes at the level of their English-speaking peers.
High schools, the last stop between adolescence and adulthood, do not have that kind of time. Getting students to graduation often means catching them up to a field that has a 15-year head start.
In recent decades, some degree of segregation has often been involved in teaching immigrants. Through the 1980s, schools generally pulled them out of the mainstream for at least an hour or two each day for ''English as a Second Language'' courses that were largely focused on basic English and vocational training.
As national education standards were adopted in 1989, some school districts established dual-language programs that allowed students learning English to study core subjects in their native languages until they were able to move into mainstream classes. Other districts, hit by the largest waves of immigrants, established so-called newcomer schools, where immigrants were clustered to help them adapt to their new surroundings and develop their English skills before moving on to regular schools.
When significant numbers of immigrants began arriving in Prince William County, the school district, like others across the country, essentially created newcomer schools-within-schools, where students learning English are placed for all but a few electives like art, R.O.T.C. or auto mechanics. The goal, educators say, is to give them intensive attention until they are ready to join mainstream classes.
The reality, experts acknowledge, is that only a few high school students ever make that jump.
''I would love nothing better than to have my kids in classes all over the building,'' Ms. Cain said. ''But you know what would happen to them? They'd move to the back of the class, then they'd fail, and then they'd drop out.''
She began building her program -- known formally as English for Speakers of Other Languages, or ESOL -- in 2001, when she enlisted a colleague to teach a separate world history class for those learning English.
Ms. Cain sat in to learn the information, then taught a review class so her students understood the material well enough to pass state tests.
The following years, she set up similar pairs of classes in earth science, biology and American history. A Peruvian teacher, who made fun of his own thick accent so the students would be less self-conscious about theirs, began teaching algebra and geometry. And the head of the English department agreed to teach a class that would help students complete a required research paper.
The curriculum for those learning English covers most of the same material taught in mainstream classes, except that teachers move more slowly and rely more on visual aids. Students in Ms. Cain's program generally outperform other English learners in the state on standardized tests, and do as well or better than Hylton's mainstream students. Last year, for example, all of the English learners passed Virginia's writing exam; by comparison, 97 percent of the general population passed. In math, 91 percent of Hylton's ESOL students passed the exam, the same percentage as other students. And 89 percent of the English learners passed the history exam, compared with 91 percent of the others.
Teaching to Tests
The consistently good scores turned out by Hylton's English learners gave rise to suspicions of cheating a few years ago, which a state audit concluded were unfounded. But watching the program up close reveals that certain tricks and shortcuts are built in.
Sample tests are published on the Internet, for example. Ms. Cain studies them and uses them as guides. ''It used to be that we were told not to teach to the test,'' she said. ''Now, that's what everyone tells us, from state administrators on down.''
''Teachers know what's going to be on the test,'' she added. ''And if you only have a limited amount of time, that's what you're going to teach.''
Compared with mainstream students, the average English learner at Hylton spends twice the time with twice the number of teachers on core subjects needed to graduate. Their classes are light on lectures and heavy on drills, games and worksheets intended to help them memorize facts about topics as varied as European monarchies, rock formation and the workings of the human heart.
At Hylton, freshmen finish Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'' in a month, while immigrants pore over it for an entire semester. Most mainstream students take tests with essay questions on the phases of the water cycle; the English learners have the option to draw posters, like one by a Bolivian-born boy who depicted himself as a water molecule rising from an ice cube, drifting into a cloud and raining over his homeland.
The immigrant students are given less homework and rarely get failing grades if they demonstrate good-faith efforts. They are given more credit for showing what they know in class participation than on written assignments. And on state standardized tests, they are offered accommodations unavailable to other students.
Teachers, for example, are allowed to read test questions to them. In some cases, the students are permitted to respond orally while teachers record their answers.
In Ms. Cain's 90-minute history review classes, which can touch on topics from the reign of Marie Antoinette to the Iraq war, getting ready for tests often seems the sole objective. Ms. Cain routinely interrupts discussions to emphasize potential questions.
''Write this down,'' she told a class one day. ''There's always a question about Huguenots.''
Significant historical episodes are often reduced to little more than sound bites. ''You don't really need to know anything more about the Battle of Britain, except that it was an air strike,'' Ms. Cain told one class. ''If you see a question about the Battle of Britain on the test, look for an answer that refers to air strikes.''
Often, she manages to combine her test tips with comparisons to historical struggles and the ones her students face today. That is how she taught them about the aftershocks of the Bolshevik Revolution. The period of paranoia that gripped the United States, she told students, was known as the Red Scare.
''If you see a question about Bolsheviks on the test,'' Ms. Cain said, ''the answer is probably Red Scare.''
Unsatisfied, Delmy asked whether Americans were right to have been afraid of a Communist invasion.
''This kind of fear has happened a few times in our history,'' Ms. Cain said. ''You know, where we blame foreigners for our problems, for wrecking the economy, for stealing our jobs. You see where I'm going?''
Melting Pot/Pressure Cooker
Like so many other suburban communities transformed by immigration, Prince William County was overwhelmed as much by the pace of the change as by its scale.
In a blink of history's eye, this commuter community became one of the 12 fastest-growing counties in the country, with a Hispanic population that surged to 19 percent from 2 percent, far outpacing growth by any other group since 1980. The enrollment of children with limited proficiency in English grew 219 percent. The county, the scene of some of the first skirmishes of the Civil War, became a battleground again.
Corey A. Stewart, chairman of the all-white, predominantly Republican Board of Supervisors, led the cause of those who argued that illegal immigrants -- an estimated 30 percent of all those moving into the county -- were an undue burden on taxpayers. It cost Prince William $40.2 million, about 5 percent of the school budget, to provide additional services to students with limited English last year, for example.
Mr. Stewart ordered his staff to identify services the county could deny to illegal immigrants. And he was a co-author of an ordinance that would have allowed the county police to check the immigration status of anyone they stopped whom they also suspected of living in the country illegally. (The authorities later backed off, limiting the police to checking the status of anyone arrested.)
''We didn't set out to pass a law addressing immigration,'' Mr. Stewart said in an interview. ''We wanted to address issues involving problems in housing, in hospitals, in schools and with crime. And we found that when we looked at all those areas, illegal immigration was driving a lot of the problems.''
In neighborhoods, however, many people did not make distinctions between legal and illegal immigrants. Some residents complained of a ''foreign invasion.'' Constructive dialogue was often drowned out by hate-filled blogs, headlines and protests. And school boundaries were bitterly contested, with some families moving their children into schools with lower populations of immigrants, and others flexing their political influence to try to keep the immigrants out.
Many parents worried that the Latino influx strained schools' resources, eroding the quality of their children's education.
''I have no problem with immigrants,'' said Lori Bauckman-Moore, a mother of five who said her mother came through Ellis Island. ''But so many of these kids don't speak English. I'm talking fourth, fifth and sixth grades, where half of the kids don't understand what their teachers are telling them. How can my child learn when teachers have to spend most of their time focused on the kids who cannot keep up with the curriculum?''
At Hylton, Ms. Cain's school-within-a-school began to feel like a bunker. Two brothers from El Salvador vented in class about always having to look over their shoulders, and then stopped coming to school. A boy from Mexico disappeared, calling a month later to ask Ms. Cain to send his transcripts to Houston.
Eventually the tumult threatened the teacher's pet: Jorge Rosales, a shy, strapping Mexican who wore gel in his hair and a medallion of the Virgin of Guadalupe around his neck.
When Jorge arrived at Hylton his sophomore year, he was reading at a sixth-grade level and failing most classes. Two years later, he was playing on the soccer team and on his way to graduating with honors.
But early last year, six months from getting his diploma, Jorge told Ms. Cain his father had lost his construction job, his parents had fallen behind in their mortgage payments, and, since no one in the Rosales family was in the country legally, his mother lived in fear that a minor traffic infraction could lead to deportation.
Ms. Cain called each member of the County Board of Supervisors and told them the crackdown was infringing on immigrant students' rights to an education. ''They told me I was the only person calling to complain,'' she said. ''All their other calls were from people who supported what they were doing.''
Before long, the polarization outside Hylton reinforced the divide between the two groups of students inside the school.
Teachers set the tone. In their classrooms, some tiptoed around the immigration debate or avoided it altogether. Advisers to student groups created to examine pressing issues -- including the school newspaper, the Model United Nations and the World of Difference Club -- similarly ignored the matter. And the teachers for those learning English made little effort to organize activities that would bring them and mainstream students together.
''To create a positive environment for my kids,'' Ms. Cain said, ''I've had to control who they're exposed to.''
The silence and separation fueled an us-versus-them dynamic. The president of Hylton's parent-teacher-student organization recalled her daughter complaining about an immigrant student wearing a T-shirt that said, ''They Can't Deport Us All.'' A Peruvian mother remembered her son coming home and asking, ''Are we legal?''
When asked why they did not have any friends among the immigrant students, some mainstream students responded by mentioning a worker who did not finish a job their parents had paid for, or a line of pregnant women at the clinic where their mother works, or a gang member who stole a friend's books.
''I identify with the people I hang around with,'' said an editor of the student newspaper, who is not named because she spoke without her parents' permission. ''My friends' parents are not cashiers or people who wash dishes.''
When Ms. Cain's students are asked why they have not made friends outside their group, they often tell stories about a customer who cursed at them while they were working at McDonald's, or an employer who cheated their father of his wages, or a student who told them to stop speaking Spanish on the school bus.
Romina Benitez Aguero said that a neighbor greeted her cheerfully on the street, but that the woman's daughters -- both Hylton students -- snubbed her.
And Francisco Espinal, from Honduras, said a teacher once shouted at him for running in the halls. ''This is not your country,'' he recalled the teacher saying. ''You are in America now.''
Costs Versus Benefits
The more Amalia Raymundo goes to school, the more she feels her options narrowing. She was a rising star in her remote village in Guatemala, the region's beauty queen and a candidate for college scholarships. But she came to this country two years ago to get to know a mother she had not seen since she was a baby, with the belief that an American education would help her fulfill her dreams of ''becoming someone.''
She works hard to make all A's. But this year, she started to wonder whether the work was worth it, and she nearly dropped out.
Amalia's classes are all in English. Still, Amalia, 19, worries that because she spends most of her school day speaking Spanish with other students, and then with her parents at home, it could be years before she is able to speak, read and write English fluently enough to compete for college.
It means she has had little access to peers and networks that might help her learn to better navigate her new country, apply for scholarships, make her own MySpace page or drive a car. She lives an hour's drive from Washington, but has visited only once, on a field trip with other immigrant students.
''If I am going to end up cleaning houses with my mother,'' Amalia said to explain why she almost quit Hylton, ''why go to high school?''
Hylton's program has become a source of pride for helping immigrant students succeed in school, but also a target of criticism that segregated classes have handicapped students by isolating them and ''dumbing down'' the curriculum.
''High schools have to make a pragmatic choice when it comes to these kids,'' said Peter B. Bedford, a history teacher who supports the program. ''Are you going to focus on educating them, or socially integrating them?''
''This school has made the choice to focus on education,'' he added. ''The best tools we can give them to function in this society are their diplomas.''
But Amy Weiler, an assistant principal, worried whether the program had turned high school into more of an end than a beginning. ''If you ask whether our program is successful at getting our students to pass tests, the data would indicate that it is,'' Ms. Weiler said. ''But if you ask whether we are helping our students to assimilate, there's no data to answer that question.''
''My fear,'' she added, ''is that if we take a look at where our ESOL students are 10 years from now, we're going to be disappointed.''
Studies suggest that English learners in separate, so-called sheltered classrooms perform better in school than do the majority of their peers who are immersed in the mainstream with little or no language support. There has been no systematic tracking, however, of English learners beyond graduation to determine whether schools are leveling playing fields or perpetuating the inequalities of a stratified society.
Some students, of course, successfully climb into the middle class and beyond, as generations of immigrants before them have. But Hispanic college graduation rates -- 16 percent of 25- to 29-year-old Hispanics born in the United States hold a college degree, compared with 34 percent of whites and 62 percent of Asian-Americans -- suggest that many recent immigrants and their children are not going to college.
Ms. Cain's anecdotal evidence bears that out. A handful of her students go on to four-year colleges, while others enroll in community colleges or join the armed services. The majority, however, eventually move into the same low-skilled jobs as their parents.
''I love hearing from my students,'' Ms. Cain said. ''But then again, I don't, because I usually don't hear what I had hoped.''
Those hopes, for example, had propelled Ms. Cain's star student, Jorge, to graduation. After his family moved to Alexandria, she adjusted his schedule so his mother could drive him the hour to school.
He loved Hylton, he recalled in an interview. ''It is the only place where everybody has the same chance,'' he said. But now, without enough money for college -- and English skills still so weak that completing community college seems a much more daunting prospect -- he installs drywall with his father.
He still remembers the architectural design class he took at Hylton and the ambitions to become a foreman it inspired. ''Sometimes when I see the floor plans,'' he said wistfully, ''I think about high school.''
Amalia, who once thought about becoming a doctor, has also learned to adjust her sights.
''When I came to this country, I had my bags packed with dreams,'' she said. ''Now I see my dreams are limited.''

HEADLINE: Chilean Town Withers in Free Market for Water

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Pascale Bonnefoy contributed reporting from Santiago, Chile.

 BODY:
QUILLAGUA, Chile -- During the past four decades here in Quillagua, a town in the record books as the driest place on earth, residents have sometimes seen glimpses of raindrops above the foothills in the distance. They never reach the ground, evaporating like a mirage while still in the air.
What the town did have was a river, feeding an oasis in the Atacama desert. But mining companies have polluted and bought up so much of the water, residents say, that for months each year the river is little more than a trickle -- and an unusable one at that.
Quillagua is among many small towns that are being swallowed up in the country's intensifying water wars. Nowhere is the system for buying and selling water more permissive than here in Chile, experts say, where water rights are private property, not a public resource, and can be traded like commodities with little government oversight or safeguards for the environment. 
Private ownership is so concentrated in some areas that a single electricity company from Spain, Endesa, has bought up 80 percent of the water rights in a huge region in the south, causing an uproar. In the north, agricultural producers are competing with mining companies to siphon off rivers and tap scarce water supplies, leaving towns like this one bone dry and withering.
''Everything, it seems, is against us,'' said Bartolome Vicentelo, 79, who once grew crops and fished for shrimp in the Loa River that fed Quillagua.
The population is about a fifth what it was less than two decades ago; so many people have left that he is one of only 120 people still here.
Some economists have hailed Chile's water rights trading system, which was established in 1981 during the military dictatorship, as a model of free-market efficiency that allocates water to its highest economic use.
But other academics and environmentalists argue that Chile's system is unsustainable because it promotes speculation, endangers the environment and allows smaller interests to be muscled out by powerful forces, like Chile's mining industry.
''The Chilean model has gone too far in the direction of unfettered regulation,'' said Carl J. Bauer, an expert on Chile's water markets at the University of Arizona. ''It hasn't thought through the public interest.''
Australia and the western United States have somewhat comparable systems, but they contain stronger environmental regulation and conflict resolution than Chile's, Dr. Bauer said.
Chile is a stark example of the debate over water crises across the globe. Concerns about shortages plague Chile's economic expansion through natural resources like copper, fruits and fish -- all of which require loads of water in a country with limited supplies of it.
''The dilemma we are facing is whether we can permit ourselves to continue to develop with the same amount of water we have now,'' said Rodrigo Weisner, Chile's water director in the Public Works Ministry.
''There is no political consensus about how to deal with the challenge of producing the resources we have -- including the biggest reserves of copper in the world -- in a country that has the most arid desert in the world,'' Mr. Weisner said.
Fernando Dougnac, an environmental lawyer in Santiago, said that balance was particularly difficult because the ''market can regulate for more economic efficiency, but not for more social-economic efficiency.''
Lately, the country's approach to water has been showing some cracks. In the Atacama desert city of Copiapo, unbridled water trading and a two-year drought mean that ''there are many more water rights for the river than water that arrives from the river,'' Mr. Dougnac said.
Quillagua is in Guinness World Records as the ''driest place'' for 37 years, yet it prospered off the Loa River, reaching a population of 800 by the 1940s. A long-haul train stopped here -- today the station is abandoned -- and the town's school was near its 120-student capacity. (Today there are 16 students.)
That prosperity first began to ebb in 1987, when the military government reduced the water to the town by more than two-thirds, said Raul Molina, a geographer at the University of Chile. But the big blows came in 1997 and 2000, when two episodes of contamination ruined the river for crop irrigation or livestock during the critical summer months.
An initial study by a professor concluded that the 1997 contamination had probably come from a copper mine run by Codelco, the state mining giant. The Chilean government then hired German experts, who said the contamination had a natural origin.
Chile's regional Agriculture and Livestock Service, part of the Ministry of Agriculture, refuted those findings in 2000, saying in a report that people, not nature, were responsible. Heavy metals and other substances associated with mineral processing were found that killed off the river's shrimp and made the water undrinkable for livestock. (Drinking water for residents had been transported in for decades.)
Codelco, the world's largest copper miner, rejects any responsibility. Pablo Orozco, a company spokesman, said that the river water had been bad for years, and that heavy rains around the time of the contamination episodes had briefly swelled it, sweeping sediments and other substances into the water.
But the debate is largely academic, because without suitable water to raise crops, many residents saw no reason to continue resisting outside offers to buy the water rights in their town. One mining company, Soquimich, or S.Q.M., ended up buying about 75 percent of the rights in Quillagua. Most residents moved away; those who remain average around 50 years old.
''Quillagua cannot resist much longer,'' said Alejandro Sanchez, 77, pointing a cane at a parched, grassless field where he once grew corn and alfalfa.
In 2007, the national water agency started investigating claims that Soquimich was extracting even more water from the Loa River than it was due. The inquiry is still pending, officials said, though the company says it has never taken more water than it owns rights to.
But early last year, the regional water authority started satellite monitoring along the Loa. After recording no water at all in the summer of 2007, Quillagua suddenly received small amounts last year, and again this January.
That has made water authorities suspicious that companies had been draining more water than permitted, according to Claudio Lam, a regional director for the Chilean water agency.
Even so, the water arriving in the summer is still not enough to produce crops, said Victor Palape, the chief of the Aymara Indians in Quillagua.
In a cruel twist, the town survives only because of daily water trucks that are partly financed by Codelco and Soquimich, the two companies that residents blame most for their troubles.
Quillagua's residents remain determined. Mr. Palape, who owns the town's main restaurant, still dreams of attracting tourists to the 108 meteor crater sites in and around Quillagua.
His sister Gloria is equally proud of Quillagua's place in history.
''To be able to live in the driest place in the world, with everything that has happened, the people have to be resilient, to be stubborn,'' she said. ''We are not giving up.''

HEADLINE: How to Pay Less for More Health Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''A Start on Health Care Reform'' (editorial, March 8):
Yes, the administration has ''ducked some of the most contentious issues.'' President Obama has said he wants ''ideas that work.'' But any plan that retains the private, multipayer insurance system that is the source of our out-of-control costs cannot possibly work. And a plan in which people keep the insurance they have will not help the growing number of Americans who find they are underinsured.
The Congressional Budget Office has shown that a mandate to purchase insurance will not lead to universal coverage. It has shown, as well, that neither information technology nor chronic disease management nor comparative effectiveness analysis -- all of which the administration is counting on -- will significantly curb costs. Only a unified public plan, based on our successful experience with Medicare, can truly address the problems of the health care system. 
Leonard Rodberg Flushing, Queens, March 8, 2009
The writer is research director of the New York metro chapter of Physicians for a National Health Program and a professor of urban studies at Queens College, CUNY.
To the Editor:
As your editorial says, ''someone will need to make the hard choices if health care reform and universal coverage are to succeed.''
And that will include recognition that today payment by fee-for-service plans is inherently inflationary; that quality of care and cost control are the prime responsibilities of the doctor, not the insurer or payer; that the doctor should be accountable for the desired indices and rewarded for their achievement.
We must also accept that the practicable road to universal coverage starts with pilot programs by Medicare. More widely applied approaches would distress so many of the players in health care that getting to yes might become impossible or take so much time that the Obama administration loses credibility as an effective agent in health care reform.
Many ideas for reform are out there, some more realistic than others. More important, some are yet to be heard.
Mitchell T. Rabkin Boston, March 8, 2009
The writer is a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and director of the Washington Advisory Group, a consulting company.
To the Editor:
President Obama is right to pursue comprehensive health care reform at the same time that he is dealing with the economic crisis. Health care reform would help recovery and growth by lifting the burden of insurance from employers and shifting it to the public as a common burden and a common bond.
I am an officer of a local chapter of a professional society, and I am saddened to see my unemployed counterparts spending so much time networking to find a job with health benefits. I fear that these hard-working people are wasting their time in a game of musical chairs, in which there are fewer and fewer chairs.
Instead, if a public health insurance program were available to them, they could immediately get to work creating value by taking on project work and building new careers. Without the fixed cost of health insurance, employers would have more flexibility to use more workers.
This is the only way our economy can recover.
Joseph S. Harrington Morton Grove, Ill., March 8, 2009
To the Editor:
What about tort reform? Anyone who practices clinical medicine knows that unnecessary health care expenditure is partly due to ''defensive'' medicine, which leads to overutilization of medical tests and procedures.
William Ankenbrandt Chicago, March 8, 2009
The writer is a neuroradiologist.
To the Editor:
Neither your editorial nor President Obama's recent statements mention single-payer health care, a k a ''Medicare for all.''
If we want to have health care that is both universal and affordable, instead of letting people go without coverage or requiring them to buy insurance they can't afford, a single-payer system is the only answer.
If we want to cut costs, we can eliminate the cumbersome bureaucracy of private insurance by turning to a single-payer system. If we want to help businesses like General Motors, single-payer would eliminate the cost of providing coverage for employees and retirees. And unlike the current system, single-payer would let patients choose their own doctors, instead of forcing them to pay extra for ''out-of-network providers.''

HEADLINE: Banishing the Ghosts in Cambodia

BYLINE: By HENRY ALFORD. 
HENRY ALFORD is a contributing editor at Travel & Leisure and Vanity Fair, and the author of ''How to Live: A Search for Wisdom from Old People (While They Are Still on This Earth).''

 BODY:
IN Kep, a tiny town on Cambodia's southern coast on the Gulf of Thailand, two British women are staring at the ghostly remains of a bombed-out seaside villa. Originally called La Perle de la Cote d'Agathe, Kep was founded in the 1920s and was the resort of choice for French Cambodia's jet set. But the Khmer Rouge had particular distaste for Kep and its sybaritic pleasures, and all but razed the town in the 1970s.
 One of the women points out a trail of wetness on the villa's walls and floor where a dog has peed. ''Oh, dear,'' she tut-tuts. ''It looks like the building is crying.'' 
 Less than a mile down the road, rising from the ashes of Kep like an extravagant bird-of-paradise, is the chic 11-room seaside hotel, Knai Bang Chatt, designed in the '70s by a protege of Le Corbusier. No one is crying here. All is luxury and escapism; lush plantings and an infinity pool are combined in a way that fairly screams ''James Bond love lair.'' Sprawled poolside is a muscular young Belgian gentleman engrossed in his Ian McEwan. The man idly smoothes out the waistband of his black designer swimsuit, the greatest irritation he will face all day. Tonight he will dine under a gorgeous palapa-style structure by the sea, and perhaps join other guests for a midnight swim in the Gulf of Thailand. 
 To many Americans, Cambodia means only two things -- the majestic temples of Angkor Wat and the Killing Fields of Phnom Penh. But there's another Cambodia -- the southern coast -- that is beginning to emerge as a popular alternative to the heavily trafficked beaches of Thailand. Here, in towns like Sihanoukville -- which, in its heyday in the 1960s, used to draw visitors like Jackie Kennedy and Catherine Deneuve -- travelers are exploring the unusual pleasures that occur at the intersection of the luxurious present and the ravaged past.
 When my boyfriend, Greg, and I spent a week on the coast this November, we experienced two firsts, both involving tiny bubbles. First, we went swimming one night in Kep among phosphorescent plankton (it's as if thousands of underwater fireflies are doing a nonstadium version of ''the wave''). Later we went into a pharmacy in Sihanoukville and, for $2.80 for 20 tablets (U.S. dollars are accepted everywhere), bought one of the unheralded marvels of modern life: effervescent codeine.
 This was not the Cambodia I expected -- the tiny bubbles Cambodia. I'd had a sneaking suspicion that my first trip to the land of Angkor Wat and ancestor worship and rampant friendliness might somehow change me, but I expected this change to be triggered by the fact that about one fifth of this country's population, including most anyone educated, was wiped out by Pol Pot in the 1970s, or that the United States probably dropped more bombs on Cambodia during Richard Nixon's presidency than it dropped on Japan in World War II.
 Y OU'D be hard-pressed to find a town center, let alone a bricks-and-mortar store, in Kep's bucolic center, but there's a buzz of activity at the series of shacks along the water that form the crab market. Here fresh crabs are pulled out of wooden cages that you can see just offshore, and, for $7, cooked with curry and stalks of local Kampot peppercorns to produce an exciting variation of everything I'd ever eaten while wearing a lobster bib. Kep is also, oddly, without a decent beach -- the sienna-colored sand at the half-mile-long town beach is clearly the world's largest accumulation of Cajun rub -- but you can take a 20-minute boat ride out to Rabbit Island, where a scattering of pale, tubby Britons and gorgeous Danish girls laze on good sand or on the porch of rented huts and sunning platforms, all amid a scrum of mangrove trees, chickens and slightly confused cows. We set ourselves beachside and Greg pulled out a cigarette pack emblazoned with the name of France's handsomest-ever movie star -- Alain Delon -- which he'd bought for 30 cents in town. I thought, I am surrounded by at least three kinds of beauty.
 We also took day trips from Kep to a temple cave and to Bokor Mountain. Although taxis, motorbikes and tuk-tuks are plentiful and cheap in Cambodia, we'd decided to hire, at $45 a day, a kind and shy 28-year-old Phnom Penh driver named Toun Bon Thim to take us around in his car, including our subsequent nine-hour drive from the coast up to Siem Reap to visit Angkor Wat. 
 When Bon Thim and Greg and I stepped out of the car near the trail to the cave temple, we were greeted by a small band of giddy and adorable Cambodian children who wanted to guide us. The kids -- led by a hilarious 14-year-old boy in a T-shirt emblazoned ''Parental Advisory'' -- led us through a muddy rice field to a steep set of wooden stairs (''203 steps. Easy!,'' Parental Advisory coached me. ''Easy for Mr. New York City!''). Soon we were peering down in a stalactite-dripping cave in which sat a very well-preserved seventh-century brick temple, about the size of four phone booths. Parental Advisory looked at my popped eyes and, aping the helium-pitched voice of a flip teenage girl, he exclaimed, ''Ohmygod!'' Suddenly I wanted to revoke every sarcastic comment I'd ever made about Angelina Jolie and her Cambodian child; I longed to take Parental Advisory back to New York with us, and turn him into America's next comedy sensation.
 Although most of the two-lane roads that link Cambodia's bigger cities have been improved and repaved in the past 10 years or so, anyone who jiggles his way in a Jeep up the 19-mile road that is being built on Bokor Mountain in nearby Kampot is vividly, if not violently, reminded of earlier road-based pittedness: by journey's end you realize that if you were a gallon of paint, not only would you be thoroughly mixed, you would now be a solid. (Loung Ung, a Cambodian writer and land mine activist who has returned to Cambodia some 30 times since escaping in 1980 and moving to Cleveland, told me that before the roads got better, she always packed sports bras for her trips back there.) The top of Bokor Mountain is the site of an abandoned hill station, including an eerie, burned-out palace hotel and a Catholic church where sometimes the fog sneaks up on you so thick that you can't see your hand in front of you. The site was the setting for the climax of the 2002 Matt Dillon crime thriller, ''City of Ghosts.''
 ''Almost every place in Cambodia has a ghost story attached to it,'' Ms. Ung said. ''I think it's because we practice Theravada Buddhism: our gods are able to cross between the borders of the world. And we believe that our ancestors are always with us. When so many people died in our country in the '70s, we ended up with a lot of haunted, unresolved lives. It's not fear, it's respect.''
 Indeed, Greg and I got our own taste of unresolved living one afternoon in Kep. We were staying at a place called the Veranda -- a series of funky bamboo and wood treehouses, many with terrific views of the Gulf of Thailand and the Vietnamese island Pho Quoc. Greg was lying in the hammock on our porch when he heard a series of mewling, feline cries coming from above him, followed by a soft thump. When he went into our bungalow, he saw first the air vent over our bathroom ceiling and then something more unusual: a kitten had landed in our shower. That night over drinks I told a fellow guest, ''I think it's a message from on high.'' The man concurred: ''Yes. And the message is: a kitten has landed in your shower.''
 The theme of untethered animals is one that reasserts itself not infrequently in Cambodia. After Kep, we spent a relaxed day in sleepy Kampot -- a placid riverfront lined with colonial-era buildings increasingly being renovated by expatriates -- pottering around the second-hand bookstore and taking in the view of Bokor Mountain. 
 From Kampot we drove three hours to the coast's most developed town, Sihanoukville, a drive during which we dodged cows, dogs and a monkey that had parked in the road in the manner of an irritable and recently deposed dictator. But the more common life-threateners were other human drivers, whose conception of the word ''lane'' can only be described as elastic. I asked Bon Thim if most Cambodians believed in reincarnation, and he said yes. I posited, ''This may explain why they drive this way.'' Equally thrilling to behold were the loads that we saw heaped onto motorbikes -- huge, jodhpur-shaped bundles of firewood or morning glories; a bureau and a desk; four twin mattresses; an IV drip; a family of four. Bon Thim told us: ''On New Year's, when workers travel home, there is even more stacking. Sometimes 20 people stacked on the roof of cars or trucks. Sometimes driver has someone seated between him and his door.''
 In Sihanoukville, we reveled in the pleasures that the rest of the coast, however lovely, had denied us: white sand beaches, shopping, non-restaurant-based night life. The beaches ranged from the utterly pristine and private one at our hotel, the Independence -- where Jackie Kennedy and Ms. Deneuve are said to have stayed and which earned the nickname the Ghost Hotel after the Khmer Rouge used it as a redoubt during their occupation of Sihanoukville -- to the very crowded Occheuteal, lined with food shacks and vendors. During our visit to Occheuteal, I bought a bunch of litchis for a dollar from a woman carrying them on her head, but passed up requests to rent an inner tube (50 cents an hour), be massaged in my chair ($6 an hour), have my back hair ''threaded'' ($5), or hear a blind man sing (unspecified). Greg and I parked ourselves at one of the food shacks and started people-watching; we rewarded ourselves with mango shakes (mango ice and sweetened condensed milk are put in a blender and frothed to a fare-thee-well).
 To shop in a country where the average daily wage is less than a dollar a day is to suddenly want to pay retail. Some of the arenas of this strange inclination are more direct than others: both of the shopping haunts that drew our attention were charity-based. On the muddy, trash-flecked dirt road that leads to Serendipity Beach, the northwestern end of Occheuteal Beach, we found the Cambodian Children's Painting Project, where kids who are kept out of school and forced into selling wares or themselves on the beach are given free language classes and painting lessons. We each bought a painting ($4 each, plus $1.50 each for frames). A few hours later we found ourselves at Rajana, a gift shop whose proceeds go to teaching young Cambodians handicraft skills. We marveled over the jewelry made from recycled bomb shells ($28 to $32) and key rings made from recycled bullets (95 cents), prior to buying lots of silk scarves ($6 to $30) and lemon-grass candles in bamboo holders ($1.75).
 Outside of the tinkly piano-bar womb of Sihanoukville's two high-end hotels -- the Independence and the Sokha -- the town's night life caters mostly to backpackers and beach bunnies, some of them just in from party capitals like Phuket or Vang Vieng, and eager to shimmer and effloresce over cocktails. A stroll down Serendipity Beach will bring you in contact with fire throwers, mystics, British Vogue photographers, sex tourists and many, many opportunities to indulge in something called a ''vodka bucket.'' Here is the youth of the world, working hard to forget the inequities of working for an understaffed and poorly run N.G.O.; here is the youth of the world, working hard to remember the name of the French dude they just made out with. The signs of these revelers' impact on the local economy are not hard to find -- certain beach bar/guesthouses offer a free night's lodging to those of their young customers willing to hand out fliers on the beach for an hour; the business card for one local bar included a map which pinpointed the locations of 1) the bar 2) an A.T.M. and 3) the hospital.
 Once Greg and I had been home for two weeks, I contemplated whether my day-to-day life had been changed by the trip. I'd stopped e-mailing Bon Thim by then; I'd also burned through our lemon-grass candles, and distributed all our scarves and effervescent codeine and Alain Delon cigarettes. I'd given up trying to recreate the fabulousness of the mango shake that I'd had on the beach. I'd even -- was it possible? -- stared at our sunset-at-Knai Bang Chatt pictures so long that I had robbed them of their power. Things seemed fairly ... status quo. A wonderful status quo -- but a status quo nevertheless.
 And then I remembered. We're adopting a cat. 
 THE LUXURIOUS PRESENT MEETS THE RAVAGED PAST
 GETTING THERE AND AROUND
 Any leg of the triangle that is Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville-Kep will take about three and a half hours by taxi and cost $30 to $60, depending on your negotiation skills. A tuk-tuk to Kampot or Bokor Mountain and back will run about $25. The ever-reliable Toun Bon Thim can be reached at bonthim@yahoo.com Several airlines, including Cathay Pacific (with a stop in Hong Kong) and Korean Air (with a stop in Seoul), have flights from Kennedy Airport in New York, with round-trip fares in April starting at about $1,300, based on a recent Web search.

HEADLINE: Safe and Neat. And if You Like College Sports ...

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
RUTGERS STADIUM is not the only expansion project under way in this spread-out township encompassing part of the Rutgers University campus. Eight years ago, Mayra and John Ransom paid $215,000 for a three-bedroom house here, and they have enjoyed living in it so much that they're doubling it in size. 
 The Ransoms work in law enforcement in Jersey City, a 40-minute drive away, but wanted to rear their family in a suburb where squealing sirens were not a part of the daily soundtrack. Piscataway -- a township of 53,000 in Middlesex County across the Raritan River from New Brunswick -- has become known because of the Rutgers football and women's basketball teams, but it is still quiet.
 ''It was a totally different world coming down here,'' Mrs. Ransom said. ''Five cars might come down the block all day long.'' 
 There are other things that the Ransoms like, too. First is ''how everyone keeps their house nice,'' as Mrs. Ransom put it. There is also the fact that their neighbors say hello, that the public schools are generally well regarded and that (most important) they feel safe. It is easy to get to the grocery store and to shopping malls, and highways like Interstate 287 and the New Jersey Turnpike are accessible.
 There is industry in town, as well as diversity. Corporations include Telcordia Technologies, Colgate-Palmolive and Johnson & Johnson. And according to piscatawaynj.org, the township's Web site, about 25 percent of the population is Asian, and another 20 percent is African-American.
 Although Piscataway does not have a classic town center, just last year it was ranked 23rd among small cities in Money Magazine's annual ranking of best places to live, as Mayor Brian Wahler and other residents (not to mention brokers) like to point out.
 ''In my lifetime,'' said Mr. Wahler, 46, a part-time mayor who grew up in Piscataway, ''it's gone from a rural, farming community to a bedroom, high-tech, historical community.''
 Because of the economy, he added, he and other officials are weighing budget cuts. ''That's a discussion that's going on in every town in the state,'' he said. ''Folks are going to have to realize that municipal governments are not immune.''
 One stretch of the Route 18 freeway expansion into the township is finished, he said; the ultimate goal is to link Routes 18 and 287. The project, he said, will alleviate traffic on River Road, a county highway that parallels the Raritan River and is the most picturesque in the 19-square-mile municipality.
 River Road is one way to get to the stadium, which at a cost of $102 million will have 53,000 seats by the fall. Residents who do not have tickets to the Scarlet Knights games already know which alternate routes to take on the six or seven days a year when Rutgers is at home. The Ransoms and their children, ages 7 and 5, do not expect life to change much. They, and many others, seem to like the fact that their town has received a lot of positive publicity.
 ''Even though Rutgers Stadium is near us, it's never impacted us,'' said Kathy Fertal, who has lived in Piscataway for 36 years with her husband, Bob. ''It's just a very convenient place to live, wherever you're working.''
 WHAT YOU'LL FIND
 Piscataway is shaped sort of like a baseball diamond: Route 287, which has five exits in the township, runs an arc between third and first bases. Densely built subdivisions are north of the highway. Centennial Avenue, lined by corporate campuses, parallels the highway and passes a shopping center that has a Wal-Mart store.
 There are large older colonials along River Road and the Colgate-Palmolive campus, with Canada geese gathering on lawns. Avenues spring eastward from River Road; there are ranches and split-levels on some streets, newer colonials on others.
 ''If you want to live in Piscataway, you can basically find something to fit every price range,'' said Barbara C. Seif, an agent at the E. A. Boniakowski Agency.
 Rutgers Stadium is at the southern tip of the township, part of the university's Busch Campus. The Livingston Campus, which includes the Rutgers Athletic Center, is adjacent. Hoes Lane runs north-south, past the municipal building, the library and sprawling Piscataway High School.
 According to statistics compiled by the state police, crime dropped to 17.7 incidences per 1,000 population in 2007, from 20.6 incidences per 1,000 in 1997. There were 85 violent crimes in 2007, down from 110 in 1997.
 WHAT YOU'LL PAY
 A recent look at the Garden State Multiple Listing Service's Web site (gsmls.com), revealed 151 houses currently on the market in Piscataway. The median price was $358,500. The range was from $129,900, for a three-bedroom built in 1940 in need of repairs, to $875,000 for a year-old seven-bedroom colonial with nearly 5,300 square feet of living space.
 About a third of the houses for sale are listed for $300,000 to $400,000. A remodeled five-bedroom bilevel built in 1968 in the New Durham/Stelton section was listed on Feb. 20 at $399,000. The 2008 tax bill on the house, which has two bedrooms and a family room on the ground floor, was $7,427.
 Paul Galiszewski, an agent for the Galis Group, said the calls from prospective buyers have been increasing since the beginning of the year because of reduced interest rates. Also, he said, it has sunk in with sellers that they cannot ask peak price. ''I think it has helped create additional activity,'' he said.
 There was a distinct downturn in the number of sales last year, although prices held fairly steady. Lisa Stephens, the township's tax assessor, said 353 houses sold in 2008, and there were 28 foreclosures. The average price was $339,600, a 3 percent drop from the 2007 average of $350,200, when 527 houses sold and there were 8 foreclosures. 
 ''We have had a price adjustment,'' said Catherine Chaudemanche, an agent for Keller Williams Realty who sells homes in Piscataway and nearby communities. ''But it's not like the rest of the country.'' One of her clients, she said, had wanted to sell her three-bedroom house recently at $325,000, but was persuaded to list it at $295,000. It sold in about three weeks.
 According to research done by Rom Chaudemanche, Ms. Chaudemanche's husband and business partner, the average length of time on the market for single-family houses was 66 days in 2008, versus 68 days in 2007. 
 WHAT TO DO
 Johnson Park, a 473-acre county-run site next to the river, has tennis courts and playing fields; wide paths for jogging and bicycling; a modest petting zoo; and a gravel track used by harness racers. Opposite the park is the Cornelius Low House, a stone mansion built in 1741 that is now home to the Middlesex County Museum.
 The township library has a cafe and an area recently designed for teenagers. Piscataway is also said to have a lot of activities for its older residents, in addition to extensive sports programs, like tennis lessons for adults, and youth baseball and softball leagues. 
 THE SCHOOLS
 The system has four elementary schools, for kindergarten through third grade; two intermediate schools for fourth and fifth grades; three middle schools for Grades 6 through 8; and the high school, for Grades 9 through 12. 
 About 2,100 students are enrolled at Piscataway High School. SAT averages for the year ending in 2008 were 516 in math, 484 in reading and 486 in writing, versus 514, 492 and 494 statewide. The class of 2008 had a 98.9 percent graduation rate, versus 92.8 percent statewide. Ninety percent of graduates planned to go on to college. 
 THE COMMUTE
 Piscataway is a short drive from the train station in New Brunswick that provides New Jersey Transit and Amtrak service to Pennsylvania Station in New York, 30 to 35 miles away. A monthly pass on the New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor line is $289. There are 17 trains that make the 50- to 70-minute trip to New York on weekdays from 6 to 9 a.m., and 14 trains back to New Brunswick from 5 to 8 p.m.
 A monthly ticket on Amtrak from New Brunswick to New York is $630, with 10-ride tickets sold for $280. Another option is to use New Jersey Transit's Edison station, which is one stop closer to New York on the Northeast Corridor Line. A monthly pass is $279. There are 15 weekday trains to New York from 6 to 9 a.m., and 10 trains back from 5 to 8 p.m.
 THE HISTORY
 The area that became known as Piscataway Township was settled in 1666 by eight Baptist and Puritan families escaping religious persecution in New Hampshire, according to a 1976 history of the township by Walter C. Meuly. The families lived near the Piscataqua River in New Hampshire, but the township's name may have come from the Lenape Indian tribe. Piscataway was interpreted to mean ''great deer river.''

HEADLINE: Following the A.I.G. Money

 BODY:
The bailouts of American International Group are also rescues of its trading partners -- banks and other financial firms -- that would have lost out if the insurer had been allowed to fail. But even after four bailouts between last September and this March, no one knows with certainty who those partners are or how much of the bailout money, now totaling $160 billion, has gone to make them whole.
 A.I.G. has not said who they are, and neither have government officials in charge of the A.I.G. bailouts -- mainly Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke -- despite repeated inquiries from Congress. (The Wall Street Journal, citing confidential documents, reported recently that about $50 billion in 2008 bailout money from A.I.G. went to at least two dozen firms, including Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America and European banks.) Late last week there was talk that more official information was forthcoming, but no one has seen it yet. 
 The secrecy is unacceptable. Taxpayers have a right to know how their tax dollars are being spent. Equally important, understanding how the financial crisis happened is crucial to ensuring that it does not happen again. To that end, Congress and the public alike need to know which firms are on the receiving end of the bailouts, how they came to require a government lifeline, and what responsibility they bear for the financial mess. 
 From what is known, it certainly does not appear that A.I.G's trading partners were entirely innocent victims of extraordinary circumstances. A.I.G. was a key player in a type of unregulated derivative called a credit default swap. Such swaps are often defined as a form of insurance because the seller guarantees payment to investors in case their investments go bust. They are not safe insurance in any familiar sense, however, because A.I.G. was not required to set aside reserves in the event of a claim. That is why, when the bubble burst and defaults rose, A.I.G. was unable to make good, provoking the bailouts.
 Still, the trading partners knew, or should have known, how dangerous the swaps were. And that is not necessarily the whole story. In the manic years of this decade, credit default swaps took off as a way to bet on the likelihood of default by a firm or an investment portfolio, without having to own any financial interest in the firm or portfolio. That is definitely not insurance, it is gambling. The reason it is not illegal gambling is that, in 2000, Congress specifically exempted credit default swaps from state gaming laws. 
 The result? Eric Dinallo, the insurance superintendent for New York State, has said that some 80 percent of the estimated $62 trillion in credit default swaps outstanding in 2008 were speculative. 
 It is unknown how much of the credit default swaps between A.I.G. and its partners were for speculation. That is a question that demands an answer. Also unknown is how much had been wagered on the demise of A.I.G. By intervening to prevent the insurer's failure, the government prevented those bets from having to be paid. Who was let off the hook?
 It is not enough to simply know more about A.I.G., its trading partners and their activities. What is needed is transparency going forward. Banks resist the idea of requiring that all trading in credit default swaps be conducted on exchanges, in the open and subject to full regulatory scrutiny. It is an idea, however, that is long overdue.

HEADLINE: Drills Go Silent as Energy Prices Plunge

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: FORT WORTH 

 BODY:
The great American drilling boom is over.
 The number of oil and gas rigs deployed to tap new energy supplies across the country has plunged to less than 1,200 from 2,400 last summer, and energy executives say the drop is accelerating further.
 Lower prices are bringing to an end an ambitious effort to squeeze more oil from aging fields and to tap new sources of natural gas. For the last four years, companies here drilled below airports, golf courses, churches and playgrounds in a frantic search for energy. They scoured the Rocky Mountains, the Great Plains, the Gulf of Mexico and Appalachia. 
 But the economic downturn has cut into demand. Global oil prices and American natural gas prices have plummeted two-thirds since last summer. Not even an unseasonably cold winter drove down unusually high inventories of natural gas.
 The drop has been good news for American consumers, with gasoline now selling for $1.92 a gallon, on average, down from a high of $4.11 in July. But the result for companies is that it is becoming unprofitable to drill.
 The reversal of fortune could have important implications for the future health of the nation's energy companies, for consumer wallets and for national aspirations to rely less on foreign energy sources.
 The drilling cutback has been particularly stark for natural gas. Gas exploration had soared in recent years after technology advances enabled the exploitation of gas trapped in huge shale beds found around Fort Worth, western Pennsylvania, upstate New York and elsewhere. 
 But that boom has created such abundant supplies that companies are not only drilling less but also deciding not to pump from wells already drilled.
 Thousands of oil and gas workers who migrated around the country to work in new fields for fat salaries have been laid off.
 ''The big bonanza is over,'' said Jay Ewing, the completion and construction manager for Devon Energy in the Barnett Shale field here, where so far this year his company has brought its rig count from 35 to 8. ''Everyone is really shocked how fast everything has turned.''
 Energy experts and company executives warn that oil and gas companies now cutting back on investments will be unable to respond quickly to a future economic recovery. John Richels, Devon's president, said that if the slump lasted two years, it could then take 18 to 24 months for companies to reassemble rig crews. 
 That means a glut could rapidly turn to scarcity, sending energy prices soaring again. Already, experts are predicting that lower domestic gas production by the end of the year will require increased imports of liquefied natural gas from places like Qatar.
 Through most of this year, gas supplies are not likely to decline sharply because so many shale wells came on line recently. But those wells should start to decline in productivity by next year, potentially leading to tight gas supplies if industrial and residential use picks up significantly in the second half of 2010.
 ''Inevitably, the market doesn't react; it overreacts and shoots itself in the foot,'' said Adam J. Robinson, director of commodities at Armored Wolf, a California hedge fund. 
 Domestic oil production is expected to increase this year over last, for the first time since 1991, according to projections by the Energy Department. That swing is attributable in part to increased production in the Gulf of Mexico from two giant new platforms that were years in the making. But some potential onshore production is likely to go untapped, as companies cut back on new drilling and abandon expensive efforts to flush extra oil from aging fields.
 Many energy executives had thought the drilling renaissance, coming after years of declines, represented a new era, particularly for gas production. Domestic natural gas output rose by almost 8 percent last year from 2007, the biggest annual jump in more than a generation.
 That jump reversed the widely held notion that domestic gas fields were in irreversible decline. It enabled the Texas billionaire T. Boone Pickens to promote a plan to use natural gas instead of gasoline in the nation's cars.
 But such ambitions are sputtering, as falling prices force companies to cut their drilling expenditures. Oil now costs $46.25 a barrel, down from a peak of more than $145 in July, and natural gas costs just less than $4 per thousand cubic feet, down from a peak of more than $13.
 One reason companies need to make cuts is that the cost of drilling and servicing operations, while falling, is still roughly double the 2005 level, while the prices oil and gas companies earn from their production are suddenly below the 2005 level. Meanwhile, the cost of borrowing money for exploration and production has soared recently in the credit crisis.
 ''When everybody sobers up after the first quarter and sees what their real cash flow is going to be,'' said G. Steven Farris, chairman and chief executive of the energy company Apache, ''people are going to be very discouraged about how much capital they have to spend and that will depress the rig count even further.''
 So far economists say the energy patch is still doing better economically than the rest of the country. The surge of drilling and leasing poured enough money into communities with oil and gas resources that they did not begin to feel the pain of the recession until the end of last year. 
 However, a slowdown appears to be coming in local tax revenue and businesses like restaurants that cater to oil workers. Residents here who receive monthly royalty checks for gas pumped through long horizontal wells tapping gas deposits deep below their homes say their payments are getting smaller or disappearing altogether. 
 Perhaps most nervous are the rig workers themselves. With the rig count in the Barnett Shale field down to less than 100 from a high of 227 in October -- and expected to go as low as 60 before the year is over -- thousands of gas field workers have already lost their jobs here.
 One who is worried is Chris Stamper, 32, a derrick hand from Union, Miss. A former furniture factory worker, he doubled his salary, to $80,000 a year, when he came to the Barnett Shale field two years ago to learn to work on a rig. Fifteen of 20 workers on Mr. Stamper's crew have already been laid off, replaced by more senior workers from other crews that were disassembled in recent weeks.
 He keeps thinking about the $216,000 house he bought for his family back in Union.
 ''I have to pay for it,'' he said. ''That's what I worry about.''

HEADLINE: Libya Complains

 BODY:
Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi did the right thing five years ago in deciding to end Libya's illicit nuclear and chemical weapons programs. Since then, he and his aides have not stopped complaining that they did not get a big enough payoff. 
 Last week, Libyan officials told our colleague Michael Slackman that Washington had failed to deliver on promises of conventional weapons sales, civilian nuclear cooperation and help in destroying chemical weapons. They also expressed hurt that the State Department continues to catalog Libyan human rights abuses. 
 Those complaints are particularly outrageous and offensive to the victims of past Libyan terrorism and to those still suffocating under the colonel's arbitrary rule, which includes routine torture, disappearances and a ban on all political party activity. 
 Colonel Qaddafi's decision to come clean on his weapons programs was part of a broader repositioning meant to ease pressures on his government. Tripoli also belatedly acknowledged its responsibility for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 and offered compensation to the families of its 270 victims. 
 Tripoli fulfilled the conditions the international community had set for its rehabilitation, and it has been rewarded. In 2004, the United States lifted economic sanctions. Two years later it removed Tripoli from the list of terrorist states and renewed diplomatic relations. When France agreed to sell Libya civilian nuclear reactors in 2007, Washington raised no objections or obstacles.
 Libya, not Washington, canceled the deal for help destroying its chemical weapons -- after complaining about the cost and liability terms. It has since proceeded on its own. Fine. Libya can certainly afford to pay the whole cost, and Washington can put its finite funds for securing and destroying weapons to better use. Libya is legally entitled to buy defensive and transport-related military equipment from the United States, and the Pentagon recently said it was ready to discuss such sales. If Libya wants Washington to stop citing it for human rights violations, all it has to do is stop committing them.
 We hope that other countries, notably Iran, eventually follow Libya's example and give up their nuclear weapons ambitions. The United States and its allies have plenty of valuable economic, diplomatic and security incentives they should be offering in good faith. 
 If accepted, those commitments must be fulfilled. But even grand bargains do not require blank checks or silence on human rights abuses.

HEADLINE: The Hard sell

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
Susan Dominus, a frequent contributor to the magazine, writes The Times's Big City column.

 BODY:
SHORTLY AFTER 8 o'clock on a frigid Sunday night in early January, Dolly Lenz, one of the city's best-known luxury real estate brokers, bustled into the Four Seasons with the familiarity of a longstanding customer. Dressed in a simple black Valentino suit, teetering a bit in her heels, she flashed girlish waves at the various employees and stopped to greet Steven Roth, the big-time financier behind Vornado Realty Trust, before settling in at a table alongside a bubbling pool in the center of the room. Lenz stuck out her tongue at one waiter in a friendly hello. After dinner, on the way out, she remembered to ask the maitre d' how his daughter was doing on her college applications.
 For years, Lenz, a top-selling broker in New York, if not the top-selling broker, has been a regular at the Four Seasons, on East 52nd Street, known for its powerful clientele. One waiter assured me, as I waited for her to arrive, that Lenz was rarely late. He knew her habits well -- or at least, he suggested, he once did. 
 ''She used to come here many times a week,'' he said. ''But lately we haven't been seeing much of her at all.'' 
 As the market soared in the past decade, so did the status of once-humble real estate brokers, some of whom became quasi celebrities akin to their clients, boldface names who appeared in gossip columns and, yes, became regulars at the Four Seasons, dining alongside the city's most high-profile movers and shakers. Lenz, who is 52, is one of the brashest among them, and she enjoyed huge profits as New York's infatuation with real estate transformed into a full-blown love affair. When other high-end brokers turned their noses up at condo developments in the early '80s, Lenz, who saw their potential, swooped in, garnering a reputation for selling in volume and finding ways to close challenging deals. 
 Prudential Douglas Elliman ranks Lenz, who is a vice chairman, as its top-selling broker, though it won't release specific sales or commission figures. Her rivals have contested as wildly exaggerated one published figure that suggested she sold properties worth $748 million in 2006. Whatever the real value, Lenz says her sales revenue since October is ''way off'' -- by about half from last year. And how many of those deals will actually close is something she's still trying to determine. 
 The economic downturn also coincided with Lenz's losing a client: Manhattan House, a major development on the East Side where Lenz, until late January, was the sales-and-marketing agent. Lenz claims that the developers wanted to find a broker to whom they could pay a less-expensive monthly retainer; Brian Fallon, of O'Connor Capital Partners and the partner in charge of Manhattan House, said in an e-mail message that Lenz was removed from the project for ''performance-related reasons, not financial reasons.''
 There are surely brokers relishing the chance to see Lenz, who has burned a bridge or two along the way, take a few blows. But even those brokers probably wouldn't risk their last dollars betting against Lenz's resourcefulness. If you want to see how a high-flying broker hustles around this market, Lenz -- a child of immigrants who got her early sales experience at Waldbaum's -- isn't a bad choice. 
 ''I don't think she'll do well in this economy,'' says Donald Trump, who says he doesn't ''have a lot of patience for Dolly,'' even as he admires her prowess. ''But I think she'll do better than everyone else.'' 
 Brokers all over the city are gasping for air, and Lenz would be the first to admit that she has plenty of challenges right now. ''Fewer deals means fewer meetings,'' she said when asked about the waiter's comment. Yes, she's out to dinner a lot less often, and she says she misses the $50,000-a-table fund-raisers at Cipriani, the jaunts on clients' private planes to the West Coast. ''It's like my life went from glamorous to hard knocks,'' she said. ''And it happened'' -- she snapped her fingers -- ''like that.''
 These days, Lenz tells anyone who asks that she's making hundreds of sales. Unfortunately, they involve only a handful of apartments. She has to persuade the buyer; and then the bank; and then the same buyer again, because he has gotten cold feet; and then another buyer, if she's lucky enough to find one to replace the first one, who ultimately walked away. ''I have to keep selling and reselling and reselling the apartment to get them to close,'' Lenz says. 
 She told me about a typical meeting at the Four Seasons with a couple in their early 40s who were seriously considering walking away from a $450,000 deposit they'd put down on a $4.5 million apartment. What was killing them, she says she suspected, was that the market had fallen since they signed the contract three months earlier. ''In an up market, everyone's dying to close,'' Lenz told me shortly before she lost the Manhattan House business. ''You have to redo the floors -- O.K., it's $20,000, but maybe you've made that much money on the apartment's value anyway by the time you move in. That's the kind of calculation people used to make.'' Given the downturn -- condo prices are down 10 percent from a year ago, and recent estimates suggest they will drop by another 20 percent by the end of 2010 -- jittery would-be buyers are doing the math and deciding it makes sense to walk away from a 10 or even 20 percent down payment. If the apartment is worth 20 percent less, why throw good money after bad? One friend of Lenz's gave up a $1.7 million down payment he put on a property. ''He didn't need it,'' she said. ''For him, it was a purely financial decision.'' 
 A year ago, Lenz says, mortgage brokers were practically begging to place a liaison in her office, setting up lavish catered brunches. Now she's the one begging the lenders. When the credit crunch hit hard in September, she went through 16 appraisals and eight banks before she could close on a $2 million apartment. Around the same time, Lenz started working the phones at various lenders, finding her way up the food chain, taking banking executives to dinner, sending them the link to her Web site, dropping names, whatever she could do to win their few remaining credit lines. In late February, she spent a day at the offices of Morgan Stanley's private-wealth group, trying to persuade the bankers to finance some properties. She even gave a banker a tour of some of the properties for which she was trying to get financing, pointing out the working fireplaces, the river views, the strength of the assets. ''Never did that before,'' she said. ''Total first.'' 
 One evening last month, Lenz dug out of her Hermes bag a photo of herself taken 15 years ago on the yacht of a billionaire investor. Dressed in a one-piece bathing suit, her two young children beside her, Lenz appears as an Everymother, a stout brunette with oversize glasses.
 Today Lenz presents a perfect (if, by her own admission, cliched) version of a successful, wealthy woman: blond hair furnished by Frederic Fekkai, trim figure, manicured oval nails, makeup by Chanel. ''This is my uniform,'' she said of her Valentino suit. It's the kind of look, she says, that communicates: ''I'm a coward or a conformist''; also, money, prestige and effort. 
 She first set her mind to this transformation seven years ago, and to keep it up, Lenz starts every morning by running 10 miles, stopping occasionally to check her BlackBerry. Sometimes she gets e-mail messages from friends who have caught a glimpse of her and comment on her unusual form: she runs fists clenched, her arms across her chest, Rocky-style. ''Gearing up for a fight?'' her friends sometimes ask. 
 The glossy armor, the 10-mile runs, the rapid-fire patter that Lenz can unleash in several languages -- they're all useful tools in the arsenal of a competitor in a cutthroat field. Lenz, who admits she'll ''get in your face if I think I'm right,'' was famously ordered by a judge to stop showing a property on Park Avenue long after the developer reassigned the exclusive to one of her competitors. Other working relationships have also ended acrimoniously. 
 ''She's a lightning rod,'' says Paul Purcell, the former president of what was then Douglas Elliman who is now a co-founder of Charles Rutenberg Realty. ''I'm very fond of her. But I would say that 10 percent of my time at Douglas Elliman was spent handling complaints from other brokers about her. I could never figure out what was fact and what was fiction. I'd say that a lot of very successful people push the limits.'' 
 These days, Lenz is trying to adjust to new limits -- and to a new market psychology. When she shows an apartment, she says, she doesn't want to have so much bad financial information about her client that she might reveal, however subtly -- through body language, an expression -- the seller's level of anxiety. ''If a buyer smells desperation, that's the kiss of death,'' she says. ''It's game over.'' 
 She recently lost a client to a broker who assured the seller that he could get more for the apartment than Lenz was sure he would. ''Now I have to think, Did I make a mistake?'' she said. ''Should I have been more positive somehow?'' She talked about losing that client several times over the course of a few weeks; it was obviously bothering her, and she was working it over in her mind.
 Lenz has always been driven to head off every glitch that might get in the way of a closing. Cheryl Milstein, to whom Lenz sold a $20-million-plus apartment in the Dakota, recalls Lenz's volunteering to help the seller pack to get the deal closed. But her availability has reached a new level of accommodation in this market. She recently got a call from a client, a buyer who needed to meet at a specific time. It conflicted with a promise she made to attend the memorial service for a friend of her 19-year-old daughter's. Even Lenz would not ordinarily have missed something that important to her daughter, but this time, she says, she had no choice. ''It was not fair to anyone for me to miss that meeting,'' she told me. 
 One advantage to being multilingual is that you can seek solace in the comforting cliches of more than one language. Lenz has a few she likes in Spanish, the language she grew up hearing from her Spanish parents: full stomach, empty mind; when the water's rough, fish. Lenz is now trying to seek the opportunities in the downturn. She talks hopefully about discussions with an investor looking to pick up a big development at a low price and include her as a principal. In the last serious real estate downturn, in 1991, Lenz eventually ended up profiting: when developments went belly up, the banks turned entire buildings over to her to sell, so she had the advantage of volume (and, at the time, a base of foreign buyers happy to swoop in). 
 Still, she says she feels she missed an opportunity. ''I sold to trusted friends and should have gone in with them,'' Lenz said in one of her typical near-stream-of-consciousness messages sent via BlackBerry -- meaning she should have invested rather than just brokered. ''This I regret not financially . . . all about opportunity cost after all . . . but for the adrenaline kick of it.''
 Lenz insists that she never mistook real estate for a high-status profession, private planes and drivers aside. ''That just means you have money,'' she says; ''It doesn't mean you have status. We're middlemen. What could be less important than that?'' But these days, she says, she really feels it. Some clients who once would have chatted about her kids now have no interest in small talk. When things go wrong, she says, she hears about it, and loudly. ''It's challenging; it's interesting,'' she told me at the Four Seasons, as the waiter brought the check and the burbling pool finally was shut off. ''It's just not as fun.''

HEADLINE: Times Are Tough, and Libraries Are Thriving

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

DATELINE: TEANECK 

 BODY:
 SHIRA WEISS, a 34-year-old publicist, showed up one day with her two children at the Teaneck Public Library for the first time in years after her husband had gently inquired why she needed to spend so much on books. 
 She applied for a new library card and -- after taking out two chick-lit novels, an illustrated ''Star Wars'' book for her 5-year-old, Jake, and two animal books for her 2-year-old, Ben -- she instinctively pulled out her wallet to pay.
 ''I guess it will take an adjustment period until I realize that some of the best things in life are indeed free,'' she said.
 Ms. Weiss's cheerfully erratic return to her local library illustrates a surprising upside to the economic downturn: Libraries are booming. 
 Indeed, the bad news on the economy is good news for libraries across the New York region, so long as they can escape the budget ax that is falling on many municipal services as cities and towns struggle with declining revenue.
 People are flocking to libraries after forsaking Barnes & Noble or ditching their HBO service and subscriptions to Netflix, library officials said, because libraries' books, DVDs and CDs have a significant advantage: They are free. 
 Some people are showing up at libraries for the first time for free entertainment -- movies, lectures, concerts and puppet shows, library officials said. Still others are capitalizing on their newspaper racks, books and free Internet service for job searches and investment advice or advice on a topic that the title of a much-thumbed book makes obvious: ''Surviving a Layoff: A Week-by-Week Guide to Getting your Life Back Together.''
 There is an incongruity in libraries' providing such a wealth of free services because libraries themselves are vulnerable to the economy. Towns and school districts have started to make cuts, and library hours and employees are frequent targets. 
 In Maplewood, Jane Kennedy, the library director, is grappling with a 10 percent cut to her budget, reducing it to $1.7 million, and she lamented that she is contemplating layoffs, payless furloughs and shorter hours.
 ''People need us more than ever, and we're not going to be there for them,'' she said, noting that circulation had climbed 8 percent from 2007 to 2008, to 235,285 items. ''People count on us and we want to do more, not less.''
 Librarians said they had not had to make major increases in purchases of books and DVDs, only shrewder ones -- buying extra copies of, say, a John Grisham novel and cutting back on books that might not have as large a readership.
 For now, libraries are welcoming their new popularity.
 In Chappaqua, in Westchester County, Pamela C. Thornton, the director of the Chappaqua Library, said that circulation in December was up 22.3 percent from December 2007, with patrons checking out 35,692 books, DVDs, CDs and other items. 
 In Teaneck, patronage for the last quarter of 2008 was up 7 percent compared with the previous year's last quarter, with 144,500 items borrowed, according to Michael McCue, the library's director.
 The Bergen County Cooperative Library System, a consortium of 75 libraries in northern New Jersey, reported an 8.2 percent increase in borrowing in 2008, with 10,887,000 items taken out. 
 ''People are reawakening to all the things the library has to offer, and unfortunately this is because of the economic downturn,'' said Arlene Sahraie, the library services director for the Bergen County network. ''There's a saying among librarians that libraries will get you through times of no money better than money will get you through times of no libraries.''
 Robert White, the director of the network, said he had calculated that ''the average yearly value to every card used in our system was $706.''
 ''You don't get that kind of rebate on the Discover Card,'' Mr. White said. ''And it's all free.''
 As in Ms. Weiss's case, librarians said they were noticing more adults getting library cards for the first time, or sheepishly explaining that they had lost their cards or even paying long-neglected late fees so they could use the library's free Internet service.
 Jude Schanzer, the director of programming at the East Meadow Public Library, on Long Island, tells the story of a middle-class woman in her 50s who dropped in late last year after work and applied for a library card. She confided to a librarian that it was the first library card she had possessed since childhood.
 ''Now I don't have to buy my books,'' she told Ms. Schanzer. ''This is how I'm cutting back.''
 In Ridgefield, an affluent Connecticut town where many residents work at nearby companies like Pepsi, General Electric and I.B.M., people are tapping the public library's free services even if they are financially comfortable enough for now, library officials said.
 ''I just think people are hunkering down,'' said Christina Nolan, the library's director. ''They may not have to cut out Netflix, but they're choosing to do so because they don't know what's around the corner.'' 
 Indeed, as Ms. Nolan spoke, Ann Harrington, a mother of two married to a freelance illustrator whose assignments, she said, were slipping, was carrying a half-dozen DVDs, including ''A Few Good Men'' and ''The Upside of Anger,'' as well as the inspirational football film ''Facing the Giants,'' which her whole family could watch.
 Ms. Nolan said attendance was up 20 percent at the library's abundant -- and free -- weekend and weeknight programs, with residents opting for those rather than tickets to Broadway or Lincoln Center or a movie at the multiplex. Ms. Nolan has shown the Batman movie ''The Dark Knight'' and ''Man on Wire,'' the documentary about the Twin Towers tightrope walker, to packed houses of about 100 people, something she said would not have happened a year ago. 
 Last fall in Chappaqua, a showing of ''Waitress,'' with a sweetener of 15 pies to highlight a movie motif, brought out 95 people.
 East Meadow is a blue-collar and middle-class hamlet of 40,000 on Long Island, and attendance in the library's adult programs has gone up by almost 2,000 in a year to 19,241. So many children now attend ''Storytime'' that the library runs two sections to accommodate all comers. 
 In Maplewood, Ms. Kennedy, the head librarian, said she had noticed more fathers bringing their children in during the day, ''more than we've ever seen before.'' She said she assumed that some of them may have lost their jobs and had the time to take their children to the library.
 Fewer au pairs are bringing children in because some stay-at-home mothers are doing without such help, librarians in Ridgefield said. In Chappaqua and Ridgefield, families are signing up for free passes to places like the Museum of Natural History and the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, library officials said.
 ''Here you'd think, 'Chappaqua? People can afford to go,' but they're constantly in use,'' Ms. Thornton, the library director, said of the passes. ''We're finding people fighting over them.''
 In Ridgefield, Ms. Nolan said she had observed that people who have lost jobs in a town where two-acre zoning can isolate them are finding their way to the library to seek congenial company.
 ''The library is used as a gathering place for people who are intelligent and have similar values so they're not as isolated,'' she said. ''We have days that 1,400 people come through our doors. That's a lot for a town of 24,000.''
 With unemployment rising, people are flocking to the library for help in finding jobs or switching careers or brushing up resumes or checking the financial ratings of companies that are advertising for help, library officials said. 
 In Maplewood, librarians decided so many people were asking for information about finding jobs that three weeks ago they began holding workshops on skills that longtime jobholders may never have needed, like uploading resumes on Monster.com.
 ''We thought we'd be getting people who were looking for jobs at Home Depot, but instead we got all white-collar professionals,'' Ms. Kennedy said. ''That took us back for a minute.'' 
 In East Meadow recently, four of the nine Internet-ready computers were being used for job searches.
 One of the searchers was Gary Eisele, 54, who lost his job as a customer service representative for American Home Mortgage Investment, a Melville, N.Y.-based firm that filed for bankruptcy in 2007. Mr. Eisele, one of 1,400 people let go on Long Island, has taken some temporary jobs and was checking help-wanted ads on Monster.com and CareerBuilder.com in the library because, he said, he could no longer afford home Internet service.
 When ''Slumdog Millionaire'' started winning its haul of best picture awards, Mr. McCue, the Teaneck Public Library director, went out and bought copies of the book it is based on. He said he knew there would be requests the next day.
 While meeting patrons' needs, libraries are facing austerity themselves. Teaneck's library, with a $2.5 million budget costing each homeowner $140, has begun talking to the township about possible cuts, said Mr. McCue. 
 Ridgefield's library, with a $2 million budget, has been hit with a $60,000 cut this year, which it has been able to absorb with small adjustments, but officials there worry about what may happen when the town votes on its budget in May. To give itself a cushion, the library raised late fees to 25 cents from 10 cents.
 Nonetheless, Ms. Nolan, of the Ridgefield Library, said she thinks that sustaining free services is essential.
 ''A library is the people's university,'' she said. ''From cradle to grave, you can come here and learn about ballet, astronomy, gem cutting or whatever you want.''

HEADLINE: Bad News, and More Bad News

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT. 
The public editor can be reached by e-mail: public@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE front-page headlines in The Times have been enough to depress even the cheeriest reader. A sampling from just the last couple of weeks:
 ''As Jobs Vanish, Motel Rooms Become Home''
 ''Grim Outlook Goes Global''
 ''A Gloomy Outlook for Big Season in Home Sales''
 ''So You're Dead? Don't Expect That to Stop the Debt Collector''
 Enough, some readers are saying. ''The media outlets are not helping the situation by this entire scare mongering,'' said Gord Ellenson of Whitby, Ontario. ''It's got to the point where people like me (are) turning off the news and refusing to read the paper.'' 
 He is not alone in complaining that The Times and others are overemphasizing negative economic events and even contributing to a loss of confidence that only helps prolong the recession. ''The NY Times is becoming part of the problem,'' said Paul Fournier of suburban Kansas City. Eric Levy of Parker, Colo., asked, ''How about some balance in reporting?''
 But Peter S. Goodman, a national economics correspondent for The Times, said, ''My master is reality.'' He said he introduced the word ''depression'' into a front-page article two weeks ago because two respected economists, Mark Zandi and Allen Sinai, volunteered it to him in separate interviews. Zandi said the odds of a ''mild depression'' were up to 25 percent, and Sinai saw a 20 percent chance of a ''depressionlike possibility.'' Goodman saw no way to ignore that, though he was careful to point out that nobody was comparing conditions today to the Great Depression of the 1930s.
 This is an old argument between a newspaper and its readers: journalists see their job as reflecting the world as their reporting tells them it is, but many readers want reporters to look harder for good news to balance the bad. Ellenson said he wants news organizations to go even further. ''Tell consumers not to worry,'' he said. ''Go out and spend as if there is no recession.'' 
 Maybe there are more opportunities to emphasize silver linings. The demise of flower shows in the recession was front-page news; Broadway's surprisingly strong box office was not. But The Times is not about to do what Ellenson suggests -- and should not. As David Leonhardt, a business columnist, told me: ''The problems we have are not psychological. They are hard, real problems. None of them can be resolved by waking up tomorrow and thinking we're going to be happy about them.''
 Warren Buffett, the nation's most famous investor, wrote an article on the Op-Ed page last fall announcing, under the headline, ''Buy American. I Am,'' that he was adding to his portfolio, not selling, despite the scary times. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was then above 8,800. The market would fall another 25 percent before showing signs of life last week.
 A newspaper's responsibility is not to be an economic cheerleader, but to maintain a level head and help put the world in perspective for readers. How well has The Times done that? And, to turn the question around, how well did it warn readers before the roof fell in that a dangerous housing bubble was inflating on the strength of reckless lending?
 I've been looking at front pages, examining articles dating to 2000, interviewing editors and reporters, and corresponding with readers, and I think The Times gave pretty fair warning of what could -- and then did -- happen. And it has reported the calamitous aftermath with good balance, including notable efforts to avoid exaggerating how bad things are.
 Exactly nine years ago, The Times published a 6,000-word investigative report by Diana B. Henriques and Lowell Bergman about a California-based home-equity lender using deceptive sales practices ''to lure homeowners into high-cost loans that expose them to the threat of foreclosure and financial ruin.'' The money for the loans came from Lehman Brothers and other Wall Street investment banks that were creating new mortgage bonds backed by subprime loans.
 Over the years, Gretchen Morgenson wrote that mortgage markets were out of control, that the housing bust would not be pretty, and that high-yield, mortgage-backed securities ''are not as secure as many believe.'' Edmund L. Andrews, Floyd Norris and Goodman wrote about the problem. So did Leonhardt and Motoko Rich, who in 2005 co-authored an article comparing the real estate frenzy to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. They warned that homeowners taking out adjustable-rate mortgages were making a risky trillion-dollar bet that interest rates would remain low.
 Leonhardt wrote last fall that he cringed when he reread a paragraph in that article. It quoted economists as saying that if the bet went bad, the impact would not derail the economy. I think he was being too hard on himself. Reporters cannot predict the future. The important thing was that they were focused on the right problem.
 When the economy did go off the rails, The Times tried to keep the damage in perspective. For example, the government reported in January that more than 2.5 million jobs were lost last year. A four-column headline in The Wall Street Journal said it was the largest number since 1945. That was true, but the labor force in 2008 was so much larger that the comparison, which The Times did not make, was misleading. Similarly, as comparisons to the 1930s were tossed around, Leonhardt worked with economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics to construct a broad measure of the job market, the best way to gauge the health of the economy. He found that as bad as things are, they still are not as bad as the recession of 1982, let alone the Great Depression.
 Last week's economic news was mixed. The stock market, though still at half its peak, rallied, but General Electric's debt was downgraded. General Motors said it would not need more money from the government this month. Retail sales were down, but not as much as expected. Production in exporting countries around the world is off by staggering amounts. The financial system is still filled with toxic waste from the mortgage meltdown, and the government still has not developed a clear plan for dealing with it.
 The trick for The Times is to keep it all in balance. Larry Ingrassia, the business editor, said: ''I've always thought it important to divorce yourself from whether a story is going to be positive or negative. ... Write it and let the chips fall where they fall.''
 Responding to complaints that the coverage is too negative, Joe Nocera, a business columnist, told me: ''It's just the flip side of a bull market. In a bull market, everybody gets euphoric. It's like the Cubs winning the pennant. Everyone's looking at their 401(k)'s. They're buying real estate. They devour the news. Now we're in the depressive cycle. Your team has fallen to last place. You give up. You've stopped looking at it because it's too damn depressing.''
 Even if some readers stop, The Times cannot. It is its duty to look bad news in the face.

CHEEVER
 A Life
 By Blake Bailey
 Illustrated. 770 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $35
 Following John Cheever's death from cancer in 1982, at the end of his life's work as a novelist and story maker, his reputation as a writer and human, despite his alcoholism -- indeed abetted by his recovery from it -- was at a zenith. But many more of Cheever's words were yet to be published. His letters appeared in 1988, and in 1990 and 1991 excerpts from his journals appeared in serial installments of the New Yorker -- home since 1935to 121 Cheever stories. 
 For a writer celebrated for his control of his characters' inner lives, for a husband and father notoriously prickly about his expression of the suburban proprieties -- the crewneck Shetland sweater and khakis, the plummy faux-Brahmin accent, the adoring Labrador at his feet, the woodpile neatly stacked and grass hand-scythed -- here was scandal in full spate, sludge flooding over his family and friends. Even Susan Cheever -- who in ''Home Before Dark'' (1984) had detailed her father's alcoholism and sexual ambivalence and emotional cruelty -- could not have imagined the character Cheever had been at pains to record in his journals (though Scott Donaldson's 1988 biography gave many details of Cheever's agonized psychological and erotic torments). With self-flaying candor Cheever had recorded day after day, beginning in 1939, a sorry story of incest with his beloved brother, Fred; of pain and bitterness and contempt for his wife; of relentless sexual predation. In his ''Journals'' Cheever slandered his friends, despised his mother and father, mocked his editors and despised himself, even as he managed, with heroic effort, to encourage the art he continued to fashion. 
 And here comes Blake Bailey's stunningly detailed biography, exploring step by stumbling step the crooked path that Cheever followed, disclosing the addicted urges and bawling self-pity (''What did I ever do to deserve this'') to which he submitted himself and those within his household. 
 Following a prologue, Bailey's account is chronological, beginning in the 17th-century Massachusetts Bay Colony. To be descended from American settlers was not necessarily to be from a distinguished family, and by the time Cheever was born (to the manner but not to the manor) in 1912 on Boston's South Shore in Quincy, the ''accursed'' Cheever history was already one of financial ruin, fecklessness, alcoholism, solitude, madness and suicide. John's father, a traveling shoe salesman, liked to remind his sons to remember, ''at all times, that I was a CHEEVAH.'' Literary grandiosity was a family indulgence: Cheevah's ''despised'' Uncle Hamlet was named in deference to Grandfather Aaron's well-thumbed set of Shakespeare, with, Cheever said, ''most of the speeches on human ingratitude . . . underscored.'' Cheever's grandfather died of ''alcohol & opium'' delirium tremens, alone in ''squalid lodgings'' in a Boston neighborhood of ''shabby immigrant'' tenements. 
 Cheever's mother, to her younger son's extravagant shame, owned a gift shop in Quincy. Everything about this enterprise -- the doilies and potholders, China kittens and Toby jugs, his mother's tradeswomanly exchanges with her customers, the breadwinner's power she lorded over her unemployed husband -- humiliated John Cheever, to whom Bailey ascribes the conviction that his parents were ''poor and outcast'' not owing to their bad luck or indifference to material success, but ''because they were, at bottom, strange and vulgar people.'' Cheever's mother drank herself to death, at the end of her life working her way through a case of Scotch, ''having been warned . . . that alcohol would kill her.'' (Among Bailey's virtues as a biographer is steady common sense: in his footnote he says that this Cheever-retailed family legend ''smacks of mythology.'') 
 Dealt these cards, young Cheever gave himself a bum's rush toward failure. He flunked out of Thayer Academy by flagrant displays of indolence and insolence, but prophetically translated this disgrace into a short story, ''Expelled,'' published in The New Republic in 1930, when he was 18. 
 It was in his late adolescence that Cheever's relationship -- by his own account perverse -- deepened with his elder brother, Fred. Two of Cheever's best works of fiction, the novel ''Falconer'' and the story, ''Goodbye, My Brother'' -- my favorite among all his work -- deal with extreme brotherly contests unto violence and fratricide. If John's art managed to exploit Fred's confusions and contradictions, and to make of his own extra-brotherly attraction and repulsion a grand and acutely felt human mystery, the history of Frederick Cheever seems unremittingly sad. Soon after leaving Dartmouth, Fred traveled with his younger brother to Germany in 1931, where he became an enthusiast for National Socialism. Later he rooted for the fascists in Spain, believed blacks to be ''inferior because of malnutrition'' and drank himself out of jobs and into poverty, relying on frequent handouts from John to keep himself and his oppressed family alive. John Cheever's powerful love for this man -- returned in kind -- remains an unaccountable but commonplace mystery of the twisty ways of the human heart. 
 The opening paragraph of his story ''Goodbye, My Brother'' seems confiding, knowing and generous: 
 ''We are a family that has always been very close in spirit. Our father was drowned in a sailing accident when we were young, and our mother has always stressed the fact that our familial relationships have a kind of permanence that we will never meet with again. I don't think about the family much, but . . . I am happy to recall that I am a Pommeroy -- that I have the nose, the coloring and the promise of longevity -- and that while we are not a distinguished family, we enjoy the illusion, when we are together, that the Pommeroys are unique. I don't say any of this because I'm interested in family history or because this sense of uniqueness is deep or important to me but in order to advance the point that we are loyal to one another in spite of our differences.'' 
 Here is a bravura and calculated run of unreliable narration. The steady voice lies to the reader and lies to its speaker. In the same sentence that tells us his father was drowned in a sailing accident, he boasts of permanence and longevity. Though the first speech he makes to readers is his apostrophe to the Pommeroys and their descendants, he assures us that he is uninterested in family history: ''I don't think about the family much.'' 
 The narrator teaches English at a secondary school, where he fires ''the pistol at track meets.'' He is ''past the age where I expect to be made headmaster'' and he works in the principal's office, but, he assures us, he ''respects the work.''He assures us as well that he has ''grown too old now to think'' he ''can judge the sentiment of others,'' but ''Goodbye, My Brother'' relies for energy and animus on the speaker's assumption that he knows how balefully his despised brother Lawrence regards him. 
 As the story unfolds, trench warfare between siblings and their mother gives a relentless lie to the speaker's equanimity. The mother of the story drinks herself into sullenness, staring furiously ''at the dark air in front of her nose, moving her head a little, like a fighter. I knew that there was not room in her mind then for all the injuries that were crowding into it. Her children were stupid, her husband was drowned, her servants were thieves and the chair she sat in was uncomfortable.'' 
 Anyone who has been a drunk, or lived with one, will recognize the perfect pitch of this passage, and the awful inevitability of what immediately follows it: '' 'I know one thing,' she said hoarsely. 'I know that if there is an afterlife, I'm going to have a very different kind of family. I'm going to have nothing but fabulously rich, witty and enchanting children.' '' 
 Blake Bailey discusses this story with wit and close attention to its shifts of tone. Indeed, he seems to me as good an interpreter of Cheever's stories and novels as I have read. He is undaunted by the range of Cheever's prose from the prison slang of ''Falconer'' to the high pulpit rhetoric of the writer's set pieces on light, sea, clouds, turning leaves, stars in their appropriate constellations. His own favorite story is ''The Swimmer,'' and Bailey's interweaving of Cheever's fiction with his experience -- his mystical obsession with water, the changing seasons and the night sky -- is a tour de force, a rare instance of fiction being deepened by its biographical circumstance. 
 But the business of this biography is to explore the varieties and costs of unreliability not only in the expression of art, but also in the society of family and the prison of an obsessed self. This mission makes Bailey's biography of Cheever both arresting and disturbing, a disturbance of the peace, if you will. 
 Readers of literary biographies should long ago have disabused themselves of the illusion that writers learn or wish to learn from their works how to live their lives. But in Cheever the distress between ''seemed'' and ''was'' became so flagrant that Bailey has had to take extraordinary pains to account for it. It's a paradox of the best literary biography (and this book is even more eloquent and resourceful than Bailey's celebrated biography of Richard Yates, ''A Tragic Honesty'') that it manages to unscramble the omelet. Provoked by Cheever's art -- and why else trouble his rest? -- it disassembles such a synthetic achievement as ''The Wapshot Chronicles'' and reveals that novel's constituent parts in the writer's personal history. Whether this process is wholesome or perverse is for others to judge, but it requires a bomb-disarmer's nerve and tact. 
 Bailey believes that Cheever, despite the opposing reflex of inbred reticence, meant his journals -- booby-trapped as they were with explosively candid cries of despair, resentment and lust -- to be read. But why? It may have been that those expressive magnifications of detail and hyper-focus, those blurrings, croppings and odd juxtapositions so justly admired in his fiction as a kind of magic realism, had their psychological analogue in the bent perceptions and attenuated judgment of an alcoholic. 
 Cheever, having started drinking as a youngster, finally stopped in 1975, on Page 518. Watching the years unroll via page headings throughout Bailey's ''Cheever,'' this reader reached Page 79, the year 1935, and realized with panic that I was to be pent up with a depressive drunk for 40 more years. Boo-hoo for me: think of Cheever's wife, sons and daughter! He bullied them all, with his younger son Federico receiving the least calumny but the most onerous caretaking responsibilities (hiding and watering the booze, as a kid at Andover having to parent his father coming unglued in Boston). 
 The warfare between Cheever and his wife, Mary, was Homeric in its magnificent and unremitting cruelty. Susan has described the dinner table as a ''shark tank,'' her mother muttering to herself or keeping her lips resolutely zipped, her father mumbling incoherent imprecations. 
 Even as Bailey can't help deploring the carnage Cheever left in his wake -- more than a couple of wrecked lives of those he exploited -- he manages to stand, at essential moments, in wonder. If it is alarming to read Cheever bellyaching as late as 1973 about his unrequited lusts -- ''Why should people not respond to my caresses. I'll never know'' -- it is also amazing to realize that ''his erotic drives withstood even the worst ravages of cancer and its treatment.'' These drives might more happily have been the comic excesses of Priapus (Cheever was ''the horniest man [she] ever met'' attested the actress Hope Lange, with whom he had an abiding affair), but even sex, like social class, tormented him. Just as he denigrated himself as ''a pariah -- a small and dirty fraud,'' a spy insinuated among his betters who had somehow or other ''forgotten my mission,'' drifting to the gentry's tastes and values to live out his ''disguises,'' so he recognized himself as a man who acted unrelentingly on his homosexual instincts and ''genuinely detests homosexuals'' as ''unserious, humorless and revolting.'' ''I am the sort of iconoclast,'' he wrote, ''who will ridicule the establishment endlessly and expect to be seated at the head of the table. They sometimes protest.'' 
 Because Bailey's ''Cheever'' is so wise and serious, so human an account, it may be churlish to wish that he had managed to use a bit less material to stand for the events and sensations of a life shaped by its repetitive duration. After all, the hamster's situation is striking not because it spins the exercise once or twice. And I would not want to have missed any of Bailey's storytelling (both Cheever and Yates were -- hilariously -- the principal subjects of two unrelated episodes of ''Seinfeld'') or his sound moral judgment or his critical sensibility. His sketches of dozens of characters who were touched by Cheever are short stories in themselves, and he sometimes bores right to the center of complex relationships, revealing their essence in a sentence, as when he explains Cheever's reluctance to teach while working on a novel, resenting ''distractions of any kind, especially the muddling static of apprentice prose.'' 
 So let this book be, and thanks for it. And now maybe let Cheever's torments be, and let's all read his ''Complete Novels'' and ''Collected Stories and Other Writings,'' courtesy of the Library of America and both edited by Blake Bailey.

HEADLINE: Is Anybody Buying Art These Days?

 BODY:
The Mugrabi family is a case study of not only what is wrong with the art world but also what is wrong with the moneyed classes in general (Eric Konigsberg, March 1). Instead of owning art for the enjoyment and aesthetic pleasure it brings, they see it as a market commodity to be manipulated to serve their own financial interests. Their habit of buying large quantities of art by designated artists and hoarding it, using their power as potential buyers to drive up prices paid by others, is repugnant. It's this sort of selfish greed, from the subprime-mortgage market to the ponzi scheme of Bernard Madoff, that helped usher in our current global recession. Art can transform one's interpretation and understanding of the world. The Mugrabis don't seem to comprehend that. 
 KATHLEEN M. RYAN Oxford, Ohio
 The Mugrabi saga is, to say the least, depressing. They once dealt in shmattes. They have now lowered art to that same level. I wish I were naive enough to find some good in that. It's all very sad!

HEADLINE: ARE WE THERE YET?

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The economist John Kenneth Galbraith once said, ''The only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.''
 Still, we have to ask: was that the bottom we just hit?
 After months of punishing economic news, the gloom seemed to lift last week if only for a moment. The stock market shot up 12 percent in four days. Two of the nation's biggest banks said they had returned to profitability. General Motors said it wouldn't need another $2 billion in government help this month. And retail sales were better than expected.
 Then again, perhaps that's what passes for good news these days. 
 The market is still down by more than 50 percent since its high 17 months ago. Yes, the banks made money, but for just two months, and never mind the billions of bad assets that remain on their books. G.M. will still, in all likelihood, need billions in taxpayer help down the road and there's no guarantee it will survive. And those retail sales numbers? They were still bad, just not as bad as analysts were expecting. 
 Still, there was a sense among some economists and Wall Street analysts that if the bottom was not touched, perhaps the freefall was at least slowing. No less than Lawrence Summers, President Obama's top economic adviser, said on Friday that while the economic crisis would not end anytime soon, there were early signs that it was easing.
 Which leads to a question: When we do hit the bottom -- this year or years from now -- how will we know?
 There's no easy answer.
 Mr. Galbraith was not the first or last economist to acknowledge fallibility at predicting turning points. (Just think back to assurances by top government officials in early 2007 that the growing problems with subprime mortgages were ''contained.'') 
 Forecasting the end of the current recession is even more difficult because it will hinge on how quickly and efficiently governments resolve the crisis in the banking system. Many investors continue to worry that the world's biggest financial institutions are insolvent, despite assurances from Washington that those firms have plenty of capital.
 How political leaders diagnose and fix the banks will be critical. Analysts say misguided and erratic government responses exacerbated Japan's ''lost decade'' in the 1990s and the Depression of the 1930s. ''The things that can screw it up are bad policies,'' said Thomas F. Cooley, dean of the Stern School of Business at New York University.
 In the end, there's probably no way to know for sure that we've hit bottom until we're on the rebound. Still, analysts say there are some key indicators that might help in spotting a bottom and recovery at a time when it can be hard to see past the despair.
 STOCKS
 History shows that the stock market usually hits bottom before the economy does.
 In October, Warren E. Buffett, one of the world's most successful investors, said he was buying American stocks because they usually rise ''well before either sentiment or the economy.'' But even he acknowledged not having ''the faintest idea'' what would happen in the next month or year.
 Since then, stocks have dropped by another 20 percent, and with the market at levels last seen in 1997, stocks are cheap by historical standards. The price-to-earnings ratio -- which investors use to gauge how much they are paying for each dollar of corporate profit -- is around 13, about 20 percent lower than the average of the last 130 years. 
 But many investors remain on the sidelines. Money market funds have swollen to $3.8 trillion, up from $2.4 trillion two years ago. And the cash banks are holding in their vaults and at the Federal Reserve has more than doubled in the last nine months.
 What has made the current recession so pernicious is the eroding pressure of deflation, the general decline in prices that has hurt both businesses and consumers. They earn less and the value of their businesses and homes has fallen, yet they still owe as much as they did before, said Russell Napier, a consultant with Credit Lyonnais and author of ''Anatomy of the Bear: Lessons From Wall Street's Four Great Bottoms.''
 He said he believed stocks would not rise until deflation ended and businesses could charge higher prices to pay off debts. Early indications suggest that this may be happening and that the stock market may be near the bottom, Mr. Napier said. He pointed to three indicators that often signal that economic growth and inflation are on the way -- the prices of copper, corporate bonds and inflation-protected Treasury securities. Prices for all three are higher today than they were in November.
 ''All the indicators suggest you should be buying and not selling,'' he said. Still, Mr. Napier acknowledged that stocks, while cheap, could fall further. Measured by their 10-year price-to-earnings ratio, stocks were a lot less expensive in the early 1980s, when the ratio fell to less than seven, and in the 1930s, when it was below six. 
 Nouriel Roubini, the economics professor from New York University who predicted much of the current crisis, has warned that corporate earnings and stock prices could continue to fall, perhaps precipitously.
 HOME PRICES
 To determine whether home prices are still inflated, economist use ratios that compare the cost of buying a home to renting or to median family income. If the ratios move sharply higher, as they did in recent years, it suggests home prices might be inflated. When they are falling, as they are across the country and particularly in places like San Diego, Phoenix and Tampa, owning a home becomes more affordable.
 Barry Ritholtz, a professional investor who writes the popular economics blog The Big Picture, has a simpler, more subjective, approach: Assume a young couple earning two modest incomes is looking to buy a two- or three-bedroom starter home in a middle-income neighborhood in your city. Can they qualify for a mortgage and afford to buy it? 
 ''If the answer is no, then you are not at a bottom in housing,'' said Mr. Ritholtz, who estimates that the decline in national home prices is only half-complete. 
 Just as prices in the bubble did not go up uniformly in all parts of the country, they will not reach bottom together, said Ronald J. Peltier, chief executive of Home Services of America, a real estate brokerage firm. 
 In places like Riverside, Calif., and Miami, where homes are selling for half or less than what they sold for three or four years ago, real estate may be close to the bottom. One telling sign is that first-time home buyers and investors are snapping up homes, though they are mostly buying from banks selling foreclosed properties at deep discounts. Sales of existing homes in California jumped by more than 50 percent in January from a year earlier. But the median price was down more than 40 percent, to $224,000.
 At the same time, prices have come down a lot less in urban areas like Manhattan and, not surprisingly, the number of homes being sold is down by as much as 50 percent from a year ago. Prices in these urban areas will have to fall much more before many young couples can afford starter homes. 
 Of course, those who bought at the peak of the market will suffer the greatest pain if they are forced to sell. But Mr. Peltier and other specialists say the current dismal market will only be resolved by lower prices, easier lending and an improving economy.
 CONSUMER SPENDING
 Americans like to buy things, and for at least the last decade, many economists assumed they would continue to spend on cars, clothes and the latest digital toy, good times or not. Consumer spending has rarely declined in the post-World-War-II era and when it has, it bounced back quickly. 
 The current recession is severely testing that article of faith. Personal consumption fell by about 1 percent in the second half of last year -- the first sustained decline since 1980. Economists say consumption will be slow to recover because debt-saddled Americans are saving more or paying down debt. The savings rate -- the amount of money consumers did not spend -- jumped to about 3 percent late last year, from practically zero, still far below its postwar average of 7 percent. 
 A sign that consumption has hit bottom may come when the savings rate begins to flatten. Spending should then rebound as pent-up demand gives way. Car sales, for instance, have fallen to levels last seen in 1981, when the population of the United States was about three-quarters of what it is today. Many families are deferring car purchases and making do with what they have. Eventually, however, they will have to replace their aging vehicles.
 In a study of economic cycles, Edward E. Leamer, an economist at the Anderson School of Management at the University of California at Los Angeles, found that auto sales and home building tended to lead recoveries. 
 An increase in international trade would be another early indicator that consumer spending here and abroad has hit the floor and begun to rebound. 
 After growing at an average of 7 percent a year for most of this decade, global trade was little changed from March to September last year, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Many large economies including the United States, Japan and China have reported a sharp drop in exports and imports in recent months. There was more bad news on Friday, when the Commerce Department reported that exports from and imports to the United States fell by about 12 percent in January.
 ''Seeing global trade pick up would be a very positive sign,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and now a professor at Harvard. 
 Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup, has another indicator for spotting when we have hit bottom: When we stop behaving like children in the backseat of the car asking their parents, ''Are we there yet?''

HEADLINE: Pressures on Coaches Ease in Hard Times

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL; Thayer Evans contributed reporting from Oklahoma City, and Jack Styczynski from New York.

 BODY:
When the Big East expanded to 16 teams in 2005 and decided to continue playing its postseason basketball tournament with only the top 12, its coaches were relentless in their criticism. They maintained that not reaching the Big East tournament would turn into a ''coach killer'' -- that failing to earn a trip to New York would cost them their jobs. 
 Their concerns might not have been fully realized the past few years, but the Big East adopted a 16-team format for its 2009 tournament. With the coach-killing benchmark no longer in place, no Big East coaches are expected to be fired this spring. 
 That development may have nothing to do with the tournament's expansion. The country's economic decline has had an impact on every conference, from the big-budget Big East to the tiny America East. With multimillion-dollar buyouts tougher to afford, it is a good year to have a bad season.
 ''The economy is going to heighten the decision-making more so than any time in the last 25 years,'' said Dan Gavitt, the Big East's associate commissioner in charge of basketball. ''The length of contracts and obligations that the institutions have to their coaches is not insignificant to the decision-making process.''
 When the stock market was soaring, universities had no problem shelling out big buyouts if they were trying to revive their basketball programs. From 2006 to 2008, 124 jobs turned over in college basketball.
 But now, a new reality has settled over the typically volatile college basketball world.
 ''I think there's a lot of coaches having bad years thankful for the bad economy,'' Nevada Coach Mark Fox said. ''Schools just aren't going to be able to afford to make changes.''
 From the standpoints of perception and reality, times have changed drastically at private and public colleges. A university that is laying off staff and faculty members would take a public-relations beating if it paid out a substantial amount of money to fire its basketball coach, then had to fork over even more to bring in somebody new. Many athletic departments are suffering from lagging ticket sales and slumping advertising revenue.
 The crunch is especially acute at universities that lack revenue from a top-tier football program. St. John's, Seton Hall and DePaul have struggled in recent years, and they receive no money from the Big East's football coffers. Norm Roberts of St. John's, Bobby Gonzalez of Seton Hall and Jerry Wainwright of DePaul have yet to lead their team to the N.C.A.A. tournament. But none of them seem to be going anywhere. That can be attributed, at least in part, to their employment at private colleges, which tend to rely heavily on fund-raising.
 ''Where our schools are really being hit is in fund-raising,'' Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese said. ''I think everyone is feeling it. It's not a good time for anyone.''
 Dave Maggard, the University of Houston's athletic director, predicted ''a lot more scrutiny'' for public universities that make expensive coaching changes. He said that the use of state money would come under increasing scrutiny, especially considering that many universities, even the larger and more visible ones, lose money on their athletic programs.
 ''A lot of places, even the big places, are running deficit budgets today,'' Maggard said. ''I think you're going to see some real pulling back and I think some real effort to economize in every way possible.''
 There have been at least 40 coaching changes a year in college basketball over the last 15 years. Over the past three years, the turnover has averaged 56. That number is likely to dip.
 Steve McClain, an assistant at Colorado, said that he wondered if he might still be the coach at Wyoming if the economy were this bad when he was fired in 2007. He posted a record of 157-115 in nine seasons at Wyoming and won an N.C.A.A. tournament game in 2002. The university paid more than a half-million dollars to buy him out.
 ''It's pretty hard to justify a $500,000 buyout right now when people are losing their jobs,'' McClain said. ''It's definitely affected what's going on in our business.''
 Still, jobs are open at Arizona, Georgia and Alabama. Those positions will probably create a ripple effect, opening up jobs at lower levels. And inevitably, changes will be made. Boston University, which plays in the America East, stunned the coaching community last week by firing Dennis Wolff. The university will have to spend more than $1 million to buy out his contract.
 Before the firing, America East Commissioner Patrick Nero said: ''I think that people are thinking these decisions a little bit longer and hesitating to pull that trigger quick. I think we've become too quick-trigger.''
 After Wolff's firing, he declined to comment. 
 Some people involved in college athletics said that the coaching churn would continue.
 ''It will be logical to say it might change the situation a little bit,'' the sports consultant Kevin O'Malley said. ''But you can't tread water in the highest levels of college athletics. You're either moving forward or backwards, and the pressures normally in place are still there.''
 One thing virtually everyone agrees on is this: if there is a slowdown in firings, it will not last long.
 ''If the economic downturn slows coaching movement because of the high cost of transition, it will likely only be temporary,'' Missouri Valley Commissioner Doug Elgin said. ''Coaching talent will always be hotly pursued.''
 Which means that soon enough, it will once again be a bad year to have a bad season.

HEADLINE: A Silver Lining For a Hotel Developer

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
EVEN in flush times, CityCenter was an ambitious undertaking. Sprawling over 67 acres on the Las Vegas Strip, it was to contain four hotels, one of them with more than 4,000 rooms, and hundreds of condominiums offering hotel services. 
 The owners -- MGM Mirage, the publicly held casino operator, and Dubai World, an investment arm of the Dubai government -- have together spent nearly $9 billion on CityCenter, which they hope to open by December.
 But the demand for hotel rooms in Las Vegas has softened in the economic downturn, and MGM Mirage, which is controlled by the financier Kirk Kerkorian, is struggling to raise funds to complete the project. The company said in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it might default on some of its loans later this year. 
 And so it may seem fitting to some observers that one of the hotel towers at CityCenter -- the Harmon -- will be 20 stories shorter than expected. 
 Designed by the London architects Foster & Partners as a 49-story building, the Harmon has instead topped out at 28 floors. More than 200 condo units, which were to fill the higher floors, have been scrapped, according to Alan Feldman, a spokesman for MGM Mirage. 
 Building inspectors discovered last summer that metal rods inserted into the structure's concrete beams to strengthen them were positioned incorrectly. Moving the rods, called rebar, to their correct locations would have required extensive demolition and rebuilding. The company decided to stop at 28 floors, a height that the existing structure could safely support, Mr. Feldman said. 
 He says the building would have been built as planned had it not been for the structural problems. But the financial savings derived from the downsizing -- an estimated $200 million, according to Mr. Feldman -- couldn't have come at a better time for MGM Mirage, which is trying to renegotiate its debt. 
 Indeed, it may be hard for MGM Mirage to show that it was damaged by the loss of the upper floors of the Harmon. Shortly after the decision to shorten the building was announced, MGM Mirage's chairman, James Murren, told The Associated Press: ''It takes pressure off of selling more condominiums; it takes pressure off of occupying more rooms.'' 
 Citywide, hotel occupancy in December 2008 was down nearly 10 percent from the previous December, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, even as average room rates fell 14 percent. 
 Joe Greff, an analyst at JPMorgan who follows the gambling industry, said: ''Every single option to improve the capital structure of MGM Mirage is on the table.''
 Those options, he said, included the possibility that CityCenter won't be finished; that it will be completed later than expected; or that MGM Mirage will sell all or part of its ownership in CityCenter.
 Aaron Auxier, an agent with the Shapiro & Sher Group who sold condominiums in the Harmon, said that canceling the condos was good for Las Vegas developers, including MGM Mirage, because ''it removed inventory'' at a time of oversupply. 
 Mr. Auxier said he had sold three units at the Harmon, including a round penthouse that brought $2,400 a square foot. Altogether, according to MGM Mirage, nearly half of the 200 Harmon condos had been sold, at prices starting at $1.3 million. According to Mr. Auxier, the buyers received their deposits back as soon as the decision not to build the condos was announced.
 Cesar Pelli, who designed the largest of the CityCenter hotels -- the 4,000-room, 61-story Aria -- said he had never heard of a skyscraper being shortened because of construction problems. Mr. Pelli has designed some of the world's tallest buildings, including the Petronas Towers in Malaysia. 
 He said the real surprise wasn't that a mistake was made, but that it wasn't caught until the building was nearly half-finished.
 Rebar errors were also discovered at the Veer Towers condominiums, also a part of CityCenter. There, the local building officials allowed the builders to strengthen the columns by encasing them in fiberglass ''jackets''; the buildings have reached their full height of 37 stories. 
 Foster & Partners, which designed the Harmon, an oval-shaped building of blue glass, did not respond to several requests for comment. But Mr. Pelli said he felt bad for the building's designers, because the Harmon Hotel has CityCenter's most prominent location. ''It's the first thing that you are going to see,'' he said.
 He added that two Veer towers, by the Chicago architect Helmut Jahn, which would have been largely hidden by the Harmon, would now be far more visible. ''Helmut must be happy with that,'' Mr. Pelli said, jokingly.
 Mr. Pelli said that the Aria was on schedule for an opening later this year. ''We designed it in better times,'' he said. ''But our client has kept on moving. They have not given us any indication of being concerned about the downturn.'' 
 Mr. Pelli's building will include a new theater for Cirque de Soleil, which is developing an Elvis-themed spectacle for the space.
 By contrast, the Harmon Hotel won't open until late 2010, according to Mr. Feldman. He said that the Harmon's exterior would be complete by the time CityCenter opens at the end of 2009. Delaying the opening, he said, allowed the company to defer about $200 million in costs from 2009 to 2010 (in addition to the $200 million it will save by not building the top 21 floors).
 The hotel is still expected to contain a Mr. Chow restaurant, a Frederic Fekkai salon and other high-end amenities. It will be managed by the Light Group, which runs several Las Vegas nightclubs.
 The Perini Building Company, the contractor for the Harmon, has disclaimed responsibility for the structural errors. In a written statement, Perini's president, Craig W. Shaw, said that plans for the building ''contained elements of reinforcing steel that could not be installed as drawn.'' As a result, he said, changes were made on-site.
 Converse Consultants, a private engineering company based in Las Vegas, was responsible for certifying that the rebar was installed correctly. Converse filed 62 separate reports with Clark County, saying that construction was proceeding as planned, according to Dan Kulin, a spokesman for the county. Those reports, Mr. Kulin said, ''were not accurate.'' Converse did not respond to requests for comment.
 By the time Halcrow Yolles, a consulting firm that had been brought in as the building's engineer of record, noticed the discrepancies between the plans and how the rebar had actually been installed, the structure had risen more than 20 floors. Halcrow Yolles, which found rebar errors on 15 of those floors, informed the county of its findings. A stop-work order was issued in July, Mr. Kulin said.
 Clark County filed a complaint with the Nevada State Engineers and Land Surveyors Board against Don J. Christiansen, the engineer who supervised the Converse inspectors, and has removed two Converse employees from the list of authorized concrete inspectors. Mr. Christiansen did not respond to requests for comment.
 The county also filed complaints with the Nevada State Contractors Board against the rebar subcontractor, Pacific Coast Steel, and against Perini. Messages left for executives at Pacific Coast were not returned. 
 At the same time, the county has changed its own procedures, requiring that county employees visit the CityCenter site at least twice a day, Mr. Kulin said, to ''look over the shoulder of people doing the inspections.''

HEADLINE: California Warns of Layoffs at Schools

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif. 

 BODY:
Public school employees throughout California are being warned of extensive job cuts as local officials face a deadline for issuing layoff notices to educators.
 The State Department of Education estimates that preliminary notices will be given to 26,500 teachers by the Sunday cutoff. An additional 15,000 bus drivers, janitors, secretaries and administrators are also expected to receive the written warnings.
 Because of the bleak economic outlook, the state has ordered local school districts to absorb more than $8 billion in cuts over the next year. Many, if not most, of the early layoff notices could be withdrawn by June, officials said.

HEADLINE: A Wounded Museum Feels a Jolt Of Progress

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
 THE heavy gold frames in the Dutch Room have been empty for 19 years this month. And the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, this city's beloved temple to idiosyncrasy, seems no closer to finding the masterpieces they once held than it has on every other sad anniversary of the nation's most storied art heist.
 The frames are the bluntest reminder of the dead-of-night theft on March 18, 1990, of three Rembrandts, a Vermeer, a Manet and other works worth several hundred million dollars by two men disguised as police officers. They remain blank because the will of Isabella Stewart Gardner, the museum's exacting founder, requires that nothing in the collection ever be moved, and that no new works brought in.
 That constraint, along with the lingering wound of the theft, has imposed rare challenges for the Gardner as today's museums compete ever more fiercely for donors and visitors. While its hodgepodge of a collection delights some visitors, its odd mix of treasures and tchotchkes, in galleries so dark as to offer only a dusky view of some objects, leaves others perplexed. 
 Yet the museum has labored in recent years to shed its fusty image and move past the theft that has, for better or worse, given it a reputation of being ''touched with evil,'' as Douglass Shand-Tucci, who wrote a biography of Gardner, once put it. Its latest goal, a 65,000-square-foot new building designed by Renzo Piano to sit behind Gardner's century-old mansion, is the boldest yet. 
 For Anne Hawley, the museum's director since 1989, the heist presented a paradox: the shock helped her bring about change far more rapidly than she would have as a new director under normal circumstances. She described it as a ''shot of adrenaline'' that led not just to the expansion campaign but to a residency program in which artists have installed surreal video art, composed vibraphone music or created graphic novels to complement the timeworn surroundings. 
 Now, in a victory the Gardner had been awaiting for months, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled on March 4 that the museum can depart from the strict parameters of Gardner's prickly will. It called the expansion a ''reasonable deviation'' from the will because it is in the public interest to protect the building from overuse.
 According to the will if the arrangement of any of the museum's holdings changes, the entire collection, the building and the land beneath it must be turned over to Harvard.
 Bostonians, who mythologize Gardner and are proudly protective of her wishes, are back and forth over whether the expansion threatens the very identity of the museum. An even bigger question is whether the museum's goal of raising at least $60 million for the project is as otherworldly as the collection itself, given the economic free fall. 
 But Ms. Hawley calls the expansion crucial to the Gardner's survival. The building, modeled on a 15th-century Venetian palace with an interior courtyard garden enclosed by a glass ceiling, has suffered too much wear and tear, she said. 
 An audit warned that without new space for the museum's frequent concerts, its cafe and the coatroom and classrooms for thousands of schoolchildren who visit each year, the collection faced irreparable damage. As many as 200,000 visitors trundle through the small galleries each year, she said, up from 1,000 when Gardner opened the collection to the public in 1903. 
 ''We all felt to be a static museum wasn't sustainable,'' Ms. Hawley said. 
 Rather than thwarting Gardner's wish that the museum exist ''for the education and enjoyment of the public forever,'' Ms. Hawley asserted that the addition will ensure it is honored for years to come.
 Mr. Piano is ubiquitous in the world of museum expansion, and his reputation for inventive but subtle designs made him a better match for the Gardner and its mandate than a bold fantasist like Frank Gehry or Zaha Hadid. His design calls for a new building just behind the museum that is slightly larger but no taller than the main building. It will house a cube-shaped performance hall with seating for 300 and apartments for artists in residence, as well as more spacious administrative offices and conservation labs.
 A new entrance, cafe, gift shop and special exhibition gallery will also be part of the addition. 
 Mr. Piano wants to connect the new building to the museum with a glass corridor. That would require moving a wall and a sarcophagus, steps that needed and won the court's approval.
 The plan also entails demolishing a brick carriage house behind the museum that has never been open to the public and four greenhouses that would be replaced with a single, larger one to grow the year-round plants and flowers for the courtyard. 
 Katherine Armstrong, a spokeswoman for the Gardner, said the new building would play the role of ''respectful nephew to the grand aunt,'' with a plain exterior that will not outshine the buff-colored brick dowager. 
 A neighborhood preservation group has opposed the project on the grounds that it violates Gardner's will, but with the high court's approval there is no barrier but the need to raise money.
 That, of course, is an infinitely steeper challenge now than when Ms. Hawley and the museum's trustees first envisioned the expansion. They have not yet started a public fund-raising campaign, and the initial estimate of $60 million may be conservative.
 Broadening the challenge, the plan is unfolding on the heels of $500 million in fund-raising for a capital project at the Museum of Fine Arts and a $75 million campaign the Institute of Contemporary Art, both in Boston. 
 Barbara Hostetter, the wife of a cable magnate, president of the Gardner's board and leader of a foundation that has given away as much as $45 million a year, is seen as a powerful asset. But whether the museum can still count on Mrs. Hostetter and other donors remains to be seen. 
 The court's approval was a welcome piece of news at a time of year that feels to Ms. Hawley and others on her staff like the anniversary of a violent death. Despite a $5 million reward, a mountain of tips that still grows almost weekly and the hiring in 2005 of a new security director -- Anthony Amore, who describes himself as obsessed with the case -- another March 18 will almost certainly pass without the stolen art's return.
 The theft has roiled many imaginations, including that of Ulrich Boser, whose book, ''The Gardner Heist: The True Story of the World's Largest Unsolved Art Theft,'' was published last month by HarperCollins. It examines a web of theories about the case and more or less concludes that the culprits were David Turner, now serving a 38-year prison term for attempting to rob an armored car, and George Reissfelder, a felon who died in 1991. 
 Mr. Boser tracked down a witness who saw two men who appeared to be police officers, presumably the thieves, in a car outside the Gardner on the night of the theft. The witness, who told Mr. Boser that the police only cursorily interviewed him afterward and never showed him mug shots, picked Mr. Turner's photo out of several that Mr. Boser shared with him.
 Ms. Hawley said she thought the F.B.I. did not work the case aggressively or skillfully enough at first, and the new book concurs. It points out, among other things, that the original agent in charge was only 26 years old.
 ''The F.B.I. gives a very standard line that they investigate all viable leads,'' Mr. Boser said in an interview. ''But occasionally you'll see evidence where they're not.'' 
 Special Agent Geoffrey Kelly of the F.B.I.'s field office in Boston, who has led the investigation for eight years, said he still spends ''a good deal of time'' running down intriguing leads. One of his predecessors went to Japan on a promising tip that led him only to a ''very good copy'' of ''The Storm on the Sea of Galilee,'' Rembrandt's only seascape.
 One of the strangest twists came in 1997, when a suspect arranged for Tom Mashberg, a reporter for The Boston Herald, to be driven to a warehouse and shown what appeared to be the Rembrandt seascape. ''We've Seen It!'' a headline in The Herald shrieked. But Mr. Kelly said investigators could never confirm whether Mr. Mashberg glimpsed the real thing.
 ''It could be anywhere at this point,'' Mr. Kelly said, adding that he finds the Gardner's empty frames ''taunting.''
 Emphasizing that the United States attorney for Massachusetts, Michael J. Sullivan, has said he would ''entertain immunity'' for whoever returns the paintings, Mr. Kelly said that ''time is of the essence.''
 Mr. Amore, a former Homeland Security official who helped overhaul security at Logan International Airport here after the Sept. 11 attacks, said he has built a database of every lead that has come in since the theft. (Security at the Gardner is now ''a step over'' the standard for museums, he added.) He said he gets frequent tips, including one from a repeat caller who insisted that former Vice President Dick Cheney was behind the theft.
 Last month a more tantalizing lead surfaced: a prisoner said through his lawyer that Mr. Reissfelder had told him before dying that the art was stashed in a house in Maine. After searching for hidden crawl spaces in several houses, Mr. Amore said, he determined that the lead was no good. Ms. Hawley said she no longer thrills to each new theory. 
 ''The first five years, every time there was a new way of going at it, I would get my hopes so high,'' she said. ''Then they would just be dashed again. Now I remain agnostic on every one. I just look coldly at these things and try to ask the best questions.'' 
 On March 18, 1990, a security guard let the thieves into the museum shortly after 1 a.m. when they claimed to be police officers investigating a disturbance, even though the rules forbade letting anyone in. They bound and gagged him and a second guard and ransacked the place in a seemingly slapdash fashion, leaving several of its most valuable works while taking a small beaker and a finial from a flag.
 They also snatched Vermeer's ''Concert,'' Manet's ''Chez Tortoni'' and works by Degas and Govaert Flinck.
 ''It's like removing a piece of our civilization,'' Ms. Hawley said. ''Imagine 'Hamlet' will never be performed again, or you will never hear a Dizzy Gillespie piece again.'' 
 The sole benefit of the robbery, in Ms. Hawley's mind, was that it focused keen attention on the museum and shook it up, helping to bring about the museum's artist-in-residence program in 1992, a program for schoolchildren in 1996 and a campaign that raised $34 million to make renovations and add climate control.
 Ms. Hawley is especially proud of the artist-in-residence program, which brings unknown but promising artists to live and work at the museum for a year. A recent resident, Luisa Rabbia, rearranged photos from a scrapbook Gardner had kept on an 1883 trip to China to create a video layered with Ms. Rabbia's own drawings. 
 ''This was always a place where minds were on fire,'' Ms. Hawley said, referring to Gardner's penchant for having artists, musicians and dancers -- including one who performed something called the Cobra -- appear at the museum in her day. ''I took this legacy and brought it back to life in today's terms.''
 Ms. Hawley hired EchoDitto, an Internet consulting firm, to help the museum recruit members and communicate with them online. Attendance is growing -- it was up almost 14 percent last month from the previous February -- but the museum needs more repeat visitors.
 Its membership base remains small, slightly more than 3,000 as compared with 70,000 at the Museum of Fine Arts, its much larger neighbor. 
 The museum also heavily promotes After Hours, a monthly evening program with music and cocktails aimed at people in their 20s and 30s. The event has its own Facebook group with about 400 members, podcasts of its music and a signature cocktail, the Madame Gautreau, named after the subject of John Singer Sargent's ''Madame X.''
 The museum is also overhauling its lighting so the collection can be seen and preserved more easily.
 Mr. Boser said the Gardner frustrates some art historians and curators because its collection of 5,000 objects spanning 30 centuries, and the building itself, are meant to solicit not an intellectual but an emotional, highly personal response. That helps explain why people viewing the empty frames, be it an F.B.I. agent, a first-time visitor or a lifelong fan of the museum, respond so viscerally.
 ''If a painting were stolen out of a contemporary art gallery where the walls are all white,'' he said, ''you might say it's a shame for that artwork. But the way that people who visit this place feel violated, it's like somebody stole this art out of their own living room.''

HEADLINE: Uncorked!

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BINDLEY

 BODY:
SPEND $500 on two magnums of Veuve Clicquot Champagne at Bagatelle on West 13th Street in the meatpacking district, and the bottles are delivered to your table with lighted sparklers stuck in their corks. 
 Spend $2,500 on a jeroboam of Veuve Clicquot and some magnums of Dom Perignon, and the lights dim, the D.J. cues up the theme from ''Superman,'' and a waiter is hoisted onto the shoulders of his fellow servers. With a tablecloth knotted around his neck as a makeshift cape and his arms outstretched, he carries one of the blazing bottles of bubbly to your table.
 As the waiter soars through the air, he does so against a backdrop of patrons fist-pumping Champagne flutes, flashing cameras capturing pictures ripe for Facebook and a dozen young women clad in sequins, stilettos and Chanel bags climbing onto chairs, banquettes, even tables -- any elevated surface that is sturdy enough to dance on.
 Christie Larkin, a 28-year-old who lives in Gramercy Park and works for a TriBeCa advertising agency, was brunching at Bagatelle for the first time. ''It's like Friday night in here!'' she said upon walking in. 
 But it is not Friday night. It is 3:30 Saturday afternoon.
 Champagne corks are always popping somewhere, of course, and the high life never disappears entirely, especially in New York. But these days, a $750 magnum of Perrier-Jouet stands in striking contrast to the scene outside Bagatelle's glass-paneled door, where the Dow has lost half its value since the fall of 2007, the recession has claimed a net total of 4.4 million jobs since it began, more than 850,000 families lost their homes to foreclosure last year, and the word ''depression'' is being heard in the land. 
 For decades the New York brunch has been far more than just a meal. It is an institution, an event that can start in midmorning and continue until late afternoon, a ritual in which eggs Benedict are routinely washed down by a seemingly endless stream of mimosas and Bloody Marys.
 And in recent months, two restaurants in the meatpacking district have begun taking Saturday brunch to a remarkable level of indulgence and expense, even by New York standards.
 The latest incarnation of Saturday brunch began last April at Bagatelle, a French bistro with decorative moldings, crystal chandeliers and striking white decor; it seats 95 people. Six months later, the high-end brunch arrived at Merkato 55, a space on Gansevoort Street that can accommodate about 300 people and typically attracts a younger and slightly less affluent crowd, though the term affluent in this context may be relative.
 The two scenes have recently garnered attention in the news media. Merkato 55 was voted ''Best Bacchanal'' by New York magazine this month. And the blog Guest of a Guest has weighed in on what the site describes as ''the Battle of the Recession-Proof Brunches.''
 The Saturday brunch scene at Bagatelle and Merkato 55 -- what some call the dance party brunch -- suggests what exclusive New York nightclubs like Tenjune and 1 Oak would look like if the D.J.'s arrived eight hours early and the bartenders served French toast. On any given Saturday, brunch enthusiasts can be found dancing on tables, throwing back tequila shots and racking up four- and five-figure tabs well before the sky turns dark.
 The aim is to make partyers feel as if they are sipping rose at an upscale cafe along the French Riviera.
 ''They can feel like they've been away for a few hours in the South of France even though they're in New York,'' said Aymeric Clemente, one of the owners of Bagatelle, who grew up in Marseille and spent summers working in Saint-Tropez. 
 The concept took off just as most Americans were watching the value of their paychecks, stock portfolios and 401(k)'s take a nosedive. This confluence is extremely perplexing to some and makes perfect sense to others, the argument being that dancing and drinking are age-old antidotes to troubled times.
 ''It's been really more crazy since the recession,'' said Mr. Clemente, who is 35. ''In a time of crises, you have a tendency of wanting to be with people and see if you can feed from their energy. If you feel sad, you want to go to a lively place, to recharge your battery.''
 But even fans of the concept acknowledge it's over the top.
 ''It's obscene,'' said Matt Sullivan, a 38-year-old owner of a building maintenance company in Miami who was in Bagatelle one recent Saturday to celebrate a friend's 30th birthday. ''We heard it was a hip brunch. But this is gluttony at its finest.''
 At 1:30 p.m. on a recent Saturday in Merkato 55, a two-level African-theme restaurant that makes ample use of dark, heavy wood, the afternoon started quietly. Some tables were empty; the music, though audible, did not cause the floor to vibrate; and bottles of wine sat sedately on ice. 
 Laura Nolte, a 23-year-old cocktail waitress, noted the relative calmness of the scene. In the upstairs room, which can seat 150, only two dozen people were actually eating. 
 ''It's funny,'' Ms. Nolte said. ''You always think, 'The economy is hitting today.' By 7 p.m., you're like, 'What crisis?' ''
 An hour later, the momentum picked up, and Joey Brodish, 26, recently laid off as an editorial assistant for a gossip magazine, expressed a similar sentiment.
 ''It's like, 'What recession?' '' said Ms. Brodish, who lives in TriBeCa and was dressed this afternoon in a glittery top paired with skinny black pants. ''Look around. Do you see a recession?'' 
 In her opinion, the Saturday afternoon dance party was just another facet of the dynamic city. 
 ''There's SoHo,'' she said. ''There's the Empire State Building. There's Merkato 55.'' 
 By 3 p.m., two members of the Gypsy Kings, special guests this day, had wrapped up their hourlong set and the D.J. had started spinning. In a large booth, a blonde wearing a short black dress with a plunging neckline mugged for a camera as she dangled a French fry from her teeth. Another woman popped out her hip and ran her tongue over the icing of a red velvet cupcake. 
 By 4 p.m., the place was wall-to-wall bodies, and people were taking hits from a rose-filled bong in the shape of a flamingo. Downstairs, Adesh Baharani was celebrating his 35th birthday by showering all within 10 feet of him (not all of them members of his party) with the contents of a $500 bottle of Veuve Clicquot. 
 ''It's my birthday, and I want everyone to be happy,'' said Mr. Baharani, who works in the jewelry business and lives in the Caribbean. ''I might buy two more.''
 Just why so many people choose to throw an extravagant party on a Saturday afternoon may be less surprising than how they could afford to do so, given the country's economic woes.
 Remi Laba, a 32-year-old Frenchman who is a co-owner of Bagatelle, suggests that such celebrating is possible because his guests are not what he calls ''recession-prone.'' 
 ''There's a very specific Saturday brunch clientele,'' Mr. Laba said, seated at a corner table near the window as brunch was getting started. ''Most of them are old money, people who don't mind coming here and spending $5,000, up to $18,000 or $20,000 on a table.''
 In addition, Mr. Laba said, the typical Bagatelle customer has a cultural affinity with this sort of rose-soaked afternoon reveling. For the most part, the customers are what he described as ''European friendly,'' meaning they either are European or aspire to be.
 As for another set of partyers, the New York investment bankers whose once-hefty bonuses may have significantly diminished in recent months, ''instead of having the $10,000 to $15,000 to spend on a Saturday afternoon, they might spend $2,000 to $3,000,'' Mr. Laba said. ''Which is fine.'' 
 The absence of a velvet rope outside Bagatelle does not signal a lack of exclusivity; patrons must know the cellphone number of one of the owners to get a reservation. 
 Through the window this afternoon, Mr. Laba observed two young men talking to the doorman about securing a table. 
 ''They will be turned away,'' he predicted. 
 And if they had been two beautiful women? ''They'll be sent to the bar,'' he said. ''I may even seat them.''
 Moments later, a striking woman standing 5 feet 11 made her way past the doorman. As she approached the host, Mr. Laba waved him over and exchanged a few quiet words with him.
 ''I wanted to make sure he wasn't sending her away,'' Mr. Laba said. ''I'm fully booked, but she's someone I want to keep in the restaurant.'' 
 What she had going for her, he said, was being stunning, sophisticated and African-American. 
 ''It's all about diversity,'' Mr. Laba added. ''Euros, Muslims, everything goes.''
 The dance party brunch concept, albeit in smaller and tamer form, took root in the mid-'90s at Le Bilboquet, a small restaurant on the Upper East Side where the atmosphere was notably reminiscent of upscale resorts in Saint-Tropez and St. Barts. Mr. Laba was a regular, and his future partner at Bagatelle, Mr. Clemente, was the general manager.
 Also employed at Le Bilboquet as waiters were identical twins from Ohio named Derek and Daniel Koch, now 26. The brothers went on to work their way up in the club scene, and in October they became the pioneers of the Merkato 55 brunch.
 At Merkato, which in a few weeks will rebrand itself with different cuisine and a different name, they have sought to make the brunch accessible to a wider range of people. Reservations are made by e-mail, first come first served, and a bottle of rose can be had for as little as $65. 
 ''Everyone's welcome,'' Daniel Koch said. ''It's brunch. Give me a break.''
 Given the number of people apparently ready to throw down $200 for some eggs and copious amounts of Champagne, there seems to be room for two shows in town. At the end of the day, some patrons of Bagatelle wander the few blocks over to Merkato 55, which stays open an hour later. Though each brunch has its own personality, both crowds go wild to a pulsing dance remix of ''I Need a Miracle.'' And by 4 p.m., both places are redolent with the same peculiar smell of muggy Champagne mixed with the Fourth of July. 
 And increasingly hard economic times may even bode well for the burgeoning brunch scene. The Koch twins maintain that people drink in good times and people drink in bad times. As Karine Bakhoum, who handles public relations for Bagatelle, said as she surveyed a line of dancers along a banquette during a recent brunch: ''Look around you. It's not snobbery; it's joy.'' 
 Lina Nguyen, 31, who lives in Midtown and works as an executive assistant for a law firm, seconded the notion of dance party brunch as therapy.
 ''I come here to forget everything!'' Ms. Nguyen, who was the first to hop up on her chair that afternoon at Bagatelle, shouted over the music. ''It beats sitting there being depressed!'' 
 Whatever diversion these afternoons bring, some acknowledged that the sight of the young well-to-do partying hard when many financial firms are being castigated for profligate spending could appear embarrassing. 
 A man who works in finance and was standing near the bar of Merkato 55 the following Saturday started to talk about this issue, but then he had second thoughts, saying he could be fired for drawing attention to the subject in the news media. Any overt display of conspicuous spending, he added, even if not a dime was expensed to a corporate account, would not sit well with his employer. ''Excess,'' he said, ''is frowned upon heavily.'' 
 As for how he and his fellow Wall Streeters could still afford such afternoons, he said: ''We all made so much money in the past five years, it doesn't matter.''
 A 29-year-old man who works for a large investment management firm and was at Bagatelle's brunch one recent Saturday and at Merkato 55's the next, put it another way: ''If you'd asked me in October, I'd say it'd be a different situation, and I don't think I'd be here. Then the government gave us $10 billion.''

HEADLINE: Japan's Political Dynasties Come Under Fire but Prove Resilient

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: YOKOSUKA, Japan 

 BODY:
By almost any measure, Katsuhito Yokokume should have at least a fighting chance in the coming parliamentary elections, which could decide Japan's future. 
 A truck driver's son who graduated from the nation's top university, Mr. Yokokume, an energetic 27-year-old lawyer, is a candidate for the main opposition Democratic Party, which has ridden rising popular discontent with the long-governing Liberal Democratic Party. Yet, on a recent chilly morning of greeting voters with deep bows and handshakes at a train station, he got the same apologetic but blunt rejection he gets every day.
 ''I'm sorry, but this is Koizumi country,'' one commuter explained. 
 He was referring to Junichiro Koizumi, the popular former prime minister whose family has represented this naval port an hour southwest of Tokyo for three generations. In announcing his retirement last autumn, Mr. Koizumi anointed his son, Shinjiro, as successor -- making the son's election as a fourth-generation lawmaker all but a foregone conclusion here.
 Such family dynasties are common across Japan, the product of more than a half-century of Liberal Democratic Party control that allowed lawmakers to build powerful local political machines and then hand them down to children and grandchildren. 
 Now, as the party faces its biggest challenge since its founding in 1955, such de facto hereditary control of parliamentary seats is coming under unprecedented criticism here. But it is also showing stubborn resilience.
 Such inherited seats have fallen under increasing attack by voters and many political scientists. They say the practice has helped create an inbred version of politics that has contributed to the leadership paralysis gripping this nation, slowing its response to the current financial crisis and Japan's longer economic decline. Political analysts have also thrust into public view the fact that powerful political and business families exert more control here than this proudly middle-class society likes to admit. 
 This has fed a fear of rising social inequalities, and the feeling that unseen barriers are preventing new talent, new ideas --literally, new blood -- from entering politics, and from helping Japan find a way out of its morass.
 ''It takes a blood test to get elected these days,'' said Sota Kato, a senior fellow at the Tokyo Foundation, a private research organization. ''It is a symptom of how Japanese society has lost its postwar dynamism and become more rigid and less democratic.''
 While second-generation lawmakers are common elsewhere -- they make up some 5 percent of the United States Congress, Mr. Kato and others said -- they are unusually numerous here. Some 40 percent of Liberal Democratic lawmakers are descendants of lawmakers. Of the past seven prime ministers here, all but one were the sons or grandsons of former lawmakers.
 The issue was thrust into public view recently by the back-to-back resignations of two prime ministers, Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda, the grandson and son, respectively, of former prime ministers. The fact that both men stepped down so quickly in the face of falling approval ratings was widely criticized here as a weakness of character seen in ''botchan'' or ''brat'' politicians.
 Despite such public disgust, it is unclear whether this will influence the coming elections, which must be called by early September and which polls show the Liberal Democrats could lose. The opposition Democrats, for one, also have their share of second-generation or higher lawmakers: 20 percent. 
 Also, as Yokosuka shows, old practices die hard. Often, the families' founding members are still revered in their districts for bringing public works projects that helped raise living standards. 
 ''Sure, we're tired of all these brats,'' said Keiko Nomura, 53, who owns a shoe shop in Yokosuka. ''But Japan still has money, and Japanese basically hate change.''
 Mr. Koizumi's decision to hand his seat to his son was greeted with disappointment in urban areas, where the criticism of hereditary seats is highest, and where the former prime minister was widely popular for his vows to change the Liberal Democratic Party's entrenched ways. 
 The younger Mr. Koizumi has kept a low profile since his anointment, and both Koizumis declined to be interviewed.
 Despite the fact that Shinjiro Koizumi has yet to announce a political platform, his father's supporters say they are enthusiastic to vote for him. They say he inherited his father's telegenic charisma. Perhaps more significantly, he will also inherit his father's roughly 5,000-member support group, which financed and organized his election campaigns.
 ''Kids are usually stupid by the third generation, but this one's different,'' said Kazuhiko Ozawa, a former chairman of Yokosuka's Chamber of Commerce who helped lead the elder Mr. Koizumi's support group.
 By contrast, Mr. Yokokume, his opponent, runs his quixotic campaign out of a grimy one-room apartment, which he shares with two election staff members sent by the Democratic Party. He said his budget was $20,000 to $30,000, a full two digits less than what the Koizumi campaign is likely to muster. 
 Mr. Yokokume said he was hoping to benefit from some kind of negative reaction to hereditary politics. Still, he is reluctant to criticize his opponent directly for fear of offending Japanese sensibilities that frown on self-promoters. Instead, he limits himself to giving his personal narrative of being a self-made success, noting that he was a law major at the prestigious University of Tokyo who passed Japan's highly competitive bar exam.
 ''I leave it to voters to make the comparison'' with the younger Mr. Koizumi, who graduated from the less well known Kanto Gakuin University, he said. Mr. Koizumi also has a master's degree in politics from Columbia University.
 But Mr. Yokokume admits that it is hard to battle an opponent who seems invincible, and whom Mr. Yokokume said he had never even seen. What keeps him going, he said, is a hope of parlaying even a defeat into an eventual career in politics, and a touch of indignation at hereditary politics.
 ''Why can't a regular person be a politician?'' he asked. ''Politics shouldn't be a family business.''

HEADLINE: Economy May Be Keeping Us Off the Road

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI

 BODY:
THE news isn't that we're driving less -- vehicle miles traveled, also known as V.M.T., has been declining for 13 straight months. In December, the country's V.M.T. was down 1.6 percent (compared to the same month last year), which translates to 3.8 billion miles not traveled. 
 But the interesting question is why we're driving less, with gas costing about half what it did last June (when prices reached $4 a gallon, according to AAA, the automobile association). It's anecdotal, but the evidence suggests that the recession is a prime factor.
 Doug Hecox, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration, said what started as a reaction to high gas prices ''may have morphed into something else.'' 
 The agency has thousands of traffic sensors on roadways around the United States, said Mr. Hecox, and all show a declining trend in driving.
 ''Sadly, they aren't mind-readers,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''When the decline in American driving was first identified in late 2007, fuel prices were beginning to increase. The prevailing wisdom at the time was that the drop was due to increased fuel prices.
 ''However, as fuel prices began to fall last August and September, American driving didn't respond,'' he added. ''Of course, our nation was struck by financial crisis in mid-September, which may have become a new factor in the decline.''
 The recession is probably a factor in public transit use, too. Rose Sheridan, a vice president at the American Public Transportation Association, said that transit ridership grew by rates ranging from 3.42 to 6.52 percent in each of the first three quarters of 2008, but growth slowed to only 1.68 percent in the fourth quarter. ''We thought we might see a decline in the last quarter because of the loss of millions of jobs, but instead we saw only a slowing in the rate of growth,'' she said.
 The association said that 58 percent of the people who take mass transit are going to work, so higher unemployment numbers could result in some ridership shrinkage. Or maybe not. ''We think that many people who have recently taken public transit for the first time realize how much money they're saving,'' Ms. Sheridan said. ''And so many of them have stuck with transit.''

HEADLINE: The Lack of Resemblance Is Completely Intentional

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY. 
E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ACROSS the street from each other at Park Avenue and 79th Street are two radically different apartment buildings -- one rooted in Romanesque Italy, the other in sleek New York Art Deco. 
 But they were designed within a few years of each other by the same architect, John Sloan.
 Upper Park was perhaps two-thirds built up when a group including the developer Henry Mandel acquired a site at the southwest corner of Park and 79th Street. 
 For this spot, Mr. Sloan, who had designed the Pershing Square Building for Mr. Mandel at 100 East 42nd Street, opposite Grand Central Terminal, conceived 898 Park Avenue, a 14-story co-op building, mostly duplexes of 13 rooms each. The building was completed in 1924.
 Mr. Sloan used the tawny palette of the Pershing Square Building, a fluttery mix of brick colors ranging from cream to orange and back again, each with mottled coloring and irregular marks and fissures to suggest a centuries-old church. The roof was finished with red tile and, at the back, a mock bell tower, all in the style of Romanesque Italy. 
 In 1925 The American Architect-The Architectural Review praised the work, saying that Mr. Sloan had used materials ''in the same way the artist painter mixes his colors.''
 The bricks vary in hue, suggesting coffee with half and half, lightly browned vanilla cookies and butter from pale winter cream. Most are riddled with hairline cracks, imperfections and irregular black spots; a tour guide in Florence might tell you Leonardo played handball against that very wall. 
 Early tenants included Haley Fiske, the president of Metropolitan Life, and Sherman Fairchild, the aviation entrepreneur and inventor. At the front door the owners passed under a glazed terra-cotta frieze of peculiar design, with figures eating, reading and sleeping -- apparently after a couple of jugs of wine. 
 A syndicate headed by Mr. Sloan bought the corner opposite 898 Park for another apartment house, 895 Park, in mid-1929. On Oct. 24, just as construction began, the stock market crashed. But work continued and the 35 apartments came on the market in the fall of 1930, most with 12 to 15 rooms at prices of $39,000 to $169,000. 
 Duplex and triplex arrangements were among Mr. Sloan's lures, which also included a squash court, a gym and a chauffeurs' room. There were no dropped beams in the entertaining rooms -- the lateral steelwork had been pushed back to the edges so that they were within the walls. The high-floor apartments, nestled among a cascade of setbacks, had some of the largest rooms in New York, up to 19 feet by 38 feet, not including an attached conservatory.
 Promotional materials puffed the attention given to rooms for staff members -- turnover was a constant headache -- but plans show typical Park Avenue servants' rooms, with no closet, room only for a bed and a dresser, and a shared bath down the hall, and that with a half-tub. 
 In 1930, The Architectural Forum praised No. 895's ''delightful simplicity,'' a conservative mix of traditional forms and modernism often now called classicizing Art Deco. The cornice above the 12th floor has wide rectangles of stone underneath, but far larger than the forms called modillions of traditional cornices. 
 The vertical elements -- broad, fluted pilasters -- are well in from the corners, rather than at the edges of the building, as was standard. 
 Only a few apartments were sold, and Mr. Sloan was living in his creation when it went into foreclosure in the spring of 1931 and was then converted to a rental. An advertisement for No. 895 in The New Yorker in early 1932 showed a picture of a suave man in white tie and the legend ''the rich are economizing wisely.'' 
 In 1952, tenants bought the building for $2 million and reconverted it to a co-op.
 Although the squash court has been eliminated, No. 895 has changed little since construction, and even has most of its original windows. 
 But at No. 898 the brick around the corner columns and the spandrel beams -- the large horizontal girders -- had to be cut out so they could be reinforced. 
 Matching old brick is a notoriously tricky task, often ending in disappointment, and in this case the 1924 brick was itself manufactured to look antique. Susanne Mackiw, a project manager for the engineers Gilsanz Murray Steficek, said, ''I spent many sleepless nights over it.'' The existing brick was too fragile to be reinstalled, and salvaged material from the Midwest was used. 
 Up close, the modern brick lacks some of the depth and character of the original, in part because time and the city have not yet had much of a go at it. But from a distance, it sometimes seems as if only the pointing is different, which can also affect the appearance of surrounding masonry. 
 The replacement windows, a dead brown instead of the original tan or buff, fight the sophisticated coloring of the masonry, but even so, the recent restoration is an admirable work.

 CORRECTION:
The Streetscapes column on March 15, about two very different looking apartment buildings designed by John Sloan opposite each other at 895 and 898 Park Avenue, referred erroneously to a squash court at No. 895. It is still intact; it has not been eliminated.

HEADLINE: Fewer Letters and More Space in the Mailbox

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
The economy has caught up with the United States Postal Service.
 For a while it seemed as if it wouldn't happen. After the Internet boom, it was predicted that paper mail would fall into a decline, pushed out by e-mail. 
 Instead, mail got a huge boost from companies like Amazon.com and Netflix that used the service to send orders received over the Internet. (It was businesses like bookstores and video stores that suffered instead.) Total mail volume rose between 1970 and 2007, even as most people stopped communicating one-on-one via the post.
 In 2008, though, pieces of mail dropped to 201 billion, from nearly 211 billion. And in the first fiscal quarter of 2009 (October through December of last year), the service reported a net loss of $384 million and said that mail volume had declined by 5.2 billion pieces compared with the same period last year.
 It's a decline that a campaign to revive the lost art of letter writing is unlikely to reverse.

HEADLINE: Recession Delivers Blow Even to Tag Sales

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

DATELINE: WAYNE, N.J. 

 BODY:
 GLASS toadstools lined a card table inside a ranch-style home under contract in northern New Jersey on a recent Saturday morning. Sauce pans and spoons flanked rubber flippers. And a waterbed, minus a mattress, was heaped with dolls. 
 ''How much for the bowling pin?'' Brian McGuinness asked as he cradled the pin in one arm and his baby in the other.
 ''How much is it worth to you?'' Christopher Curreri replied.
 ''A couple bucks,'' Mr. McGuinness fired back. 
 ''I'll take two,'' Mr. Curreri said, and the deal was done.
 Such are the rituals of a tag sale -- alternately called a garage, estate or yard sale -- which for decades has been a reliable place to find toaster ovens and bric-a-brac at pocket-change prices.
 That thrifty appeal would seem well-matched to these times, as people lose jobs and stock portfolios. Indeed, Mr. Curreri, who runs about a half-dozen tag sales a year in northern New Jersey, said 500 people had shown up that day, a relatively big number.
 But despite tag sales' current relevance, the real estate collapse has led to a sharp decline in the sales, as much as 80 percent in some areas, according to industry experts and town clerks who regulate them. A decline in the number of people selling their homes and emptying the contents before moving has hurt what industry officials say is a $10 million-a-year business in the New York metropolitan area. 
 Some tag-sale activity had moved online to sites like eBay and Craigslist, but tag-sale brokers said prices for items there had fallen. Helaine Fendelman, a former president of the Appraisers Association of America, said online prices were so low now that Internet sales were no longer compelling.
 When tag sales might rebound is a good question, she said.
 ''I wish I could say it's going to pick up in the spring, but I just don't know,'' Ms. Fendelman said. A year ago, she said, she was organizing a sale a week in New Jersey, Westchester County and Long Island; this winter, she has been organizing one a month.
 Because home sales usually prompt tag sales, when homes sales dip, tag sales do, too. (In fact, the vinyl-sided ranch where Mr. Curreri was working had been listed for two years before selling in February.)
 ''People can't sell their house to move to another residence, so they are just sitting there with all this stuff,'' said Ms. Fendelman, who hosted her first tag sale in Scarsdale, N.Y., in 1968. ''It's devastating.''
 One paradox of the housing downturn, organizers like Ms. Fendelman said, was that the rising number of foreclosures was forcing people to relocate, but without a parallel rise in tag sales. 
 A possible explanation is that people who lose their homes must vacate quickly, and so throw out possessions rather than deal with time-consuming sales, said Eileen Daly of Port Jefferson on Long Island. Her seven-year-old business, Turn the Page Tag Sales, which generally yields $1,500 to $6,000 per sale, ran 20 sales in 2006 but only 4 last year, she said. 
 ''I have people come in and say: 'I found Barbies on the side of the road. What are they worth?' '' said Ms. Daly, who also appraises pieces for clients. ''Even I've seen a lot more stuff dumped on the side of the road.'' 
 THERE may also be shame involved in calling attention to missed mortgage payments, especially as tag sales can resemble de facto neighborhood goodbye parties, said Bridget Ray, owner of Westport Estate Sales in Westport, Conn.
 Though she said she was on track to hold two dozen tag sales in Fairfield County in 2009, as in the past few years, she has still noticed a shift away from the popularity of bigger-ticket objects, like furniture, and leisure-time-focused ones, like a canoe that was for sale. (It didn't sell.)
 Ms. Ray said that the items selling best were those like coffeepots, linens and microwaves and even ''canned goods left behind in cupboards.''
 ''I found the last time we had a recession it was in our favor; they came out and bought everything,'' said Ms. Ray, who has been in the business for 38 years. ''But this is a whole new kind of thing.''
 In a bid to discourage residents from having their driveways cluttered with lawnmowers and bins of old clothes year-round, some municipalities require tag-sale permits. The Village of Great Neck on Long Island charges $35 for a license that allows one tag sale a year, and in Darien, Conn., a $5 fee allows a homeowner to hold two sales every 12 months.
 Permits in Great Neck have fallen 50 percent, with 10 issued last year but 20 in 2006, Deputy Clerk Kathy King said. Darien is down 32 percent, with 52 permits in 2008 and 76 in 2007, said Nancy Bussell, its accounts clerk. 
 Fewer permits mean less revenue, and at a time of shrinking budgets, every dollar matters, said Linda Silvestre, a deputy clerk for Mamaroneck, which experienced a decline in tag-sale permits last year to 36, from 50 in 2006, or a loss of $280.
 ''Our expenses go up constantly, so of course every little bit helps,'' Ms. Silvestre said.
 The material world's loss, however, might be the Web's gain, said Jonathon Papsin, of Fleetwood, in Westchester. 
 Betting that in the long term people will increasingly flock to the Internet to buy and sell used goods, and despite the current fall in prices, Mr. Papsin in 2007 launched a company called Tag Sell It. It is an online marketplace similar to Craigslist, though it charges a fee for many listings and more easily allows the sale of multiple items at once.
 More items are being put up for sale since his site went live in May 2008, he said, and there has been an increase in the number of daily visitors to the site, to 900 a day now from 10 a day last May. Still, it's not clear how many people are buying items, and Mr. Papsin doesn't release his sales figures.
 ''Tag sales aren't as popular as they once were,'' Mr. Papsin said. ''But sellers realize they can reach out to a lot more buyers with that online exposure.''
 Still, Mr. Papsin is not quitting his day job as a New York City real estate broker just yet. ''You have to diversify in this economy,'' he said.

1848
 Year of Revolution
 By Mike Rapport
 Illustrated. 461 pp. Basic Books. $29.95
 Two thousand eight was not a change year. Eighteen forty-eight was a change year. A series of liberal revolutions exploded from one end of Europe to the other, toppling governments from France to Hungary to many of the small German and Italian states. The revolts are not well known in the United States, but they rank in the annals of upheaval alongside the American Revolution in 1776, the French Revolution in 1789 and the end of European Communism in 1989 (relatively gentle though that was). 
 In ''1848: Year of Revolution,'' a lively, panoramic new history, Mike Rapport describes the uprisings of that year while making clear their modern resonance. The revolutionaries, he argues, were overmatched by near-impossible challenges that sound remarkably familiar today. They had to wrestle with the demons of nationalism, which threatened to drag liberal revolutions down into the muck of ethnic conflict. They had to forge new constitutional orders that could temper violent radicalism. And they had to confront the grinding poverty and social misery of the freshly empowered masses, who had unattainable expectations for economic growth and social equality. The book's descriptions of impoverished serfs and alienated city dwellers could equally well be about peasants in the Chinese countryside and migrant workers in Beijing and Chongqing today. 
 Rapport, a lecturer in history at the University of Stirling in Scotland, begins by explaining that European order had been frozen since the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, with conservative rule imposed by the great imperial courts. Chief among the absolutists was Klemens von Metternich, Austria's icy chancellor, haunted by memories of the cataclysmic wars after the French Revolution. ''In times of crisis,'' the loftily paranoid Metternich wrote, monarchs had to show themselves as ''fathers invested with all the authority which belongs to heads of families.'' The flesh-and-blood emperors were rather less impressive: Czar Nicholas I was a pioneer in creating Russia's brutal secret police, while Austria's ''mentally disabled'' Emperor Ferdinand was called ''Ferdy the Loony'' by his subjects. 
 During a deep economic crisis in the 1840s, the desperate misery of peasants, artisans and the urban poor generated popular rage at the Metternichian system. In the past, nervous governments had censored their press, clamped down on labor unions and froze the middle class and professionals out of politics. When liberals rose up in places like Naples and Piedmont, they were crushed by Austrian forces. Polish nationalists got stomped under Austrian, Prussian and Russian boots; in 1830, a Polish revolt ended with Russia hauling 80,000 Poles off to Siberia in chains. 
 What were wild demands in 1848 are democratic dogma today: free speech, parliaments, religious liberty, jury trials. But despite such noble goals, the revolutionaries were easily enraptured with violence. The great Italian democrat Giuseppe Mazzini, whom Metternich called the most dangerous man in Europe, believed that ''ideas ripen quickly when nourished by the blood of martyrs.'' 
 The insurrections were astonishingly widespread, with different local grievances detonating in sequence across the continent -- a virtual European Union of rebellion. They were ignited by a riot in Austrian-ruled Milan, which was followed by a revolution in Sicily. Next, protest marchers in Paris clashed with the municipal guard, prompting riots across the city. The French government had no stomach for the military onslaught necessary to crush the revolt, and King Louis-Philippe helplessly fled to Britain with his queen, assisted by a British vice-consul who provided the royal couple with the alias ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith.'' 
 Then German liberals and workers, thrilled by the news from Paris, took to the streets. In Hungary, Lajos Kossuth, a noble turned vehement radical against Austrian domination, thundered for self-government free from ''the pestilential air'' of Metternich's absolutism. In Vienna itself, troops opened fire on rebellious crowds; the shaken Austrian government allowed a constitution and forced Metternich to resign. Even in reactionary Prussia, where soldiers unleashed artillery against the mutinous citizenry in Berlin's streets, the king had to grant a constitution. The only great powers spared bloody chaos were Britain, where constitutional government and middle-class support were already established, and Russia, where the czar choked off any hint of revolt, radicalizing subsequent generations of revolutionaries. 
 After the electric jolt of success, the revolutionaries staggered under the weight of governing. One of the most neuralgic issues was nationalism. Metternich had struggled to maintain an empire made up of at least 11 nations, including restive Hungarians and Italians. After him, the ''springtime of nations'' left the continent awash in conflicting ethnic claims. In Frankfurt, radicals demanded a unified German state. But what about non-Germans living in that future Germany, like Danes and Poles, and what about Germans living outside a united Germany? One German politician chillingly noted ''the preponderance of the German race over most Slav races . . . is a fact.'' Many Austrian monarchists and Catholics, although ethnically German, disliked the prospect of joining their ostensible brethren. 
 Smaller nations weren't much kinder. Hungarians simultaneously demanded an end to Austrian rule and authority over Transylvania, to the resentment of many Romanians living there. The prospect of allowing Jews to vote in a liberated Hungary set off a wave of anti-Jewish riots, scaring the government into postponing Jewish emancipation temporarily. Some members of minorities in Hungary, particularly many Croats, decided they had preferred Austrian rule. Croatian troops marched to within 30 miles of Budapest before being routed by Hungarian forces. When Romanian and Serbian peasants rose against Hungarian rule, they were slaughtered. 
 As the revolutionaries struggled to provide social and economic progress, the old order reasserted itself. The liberal government in Hungary was crushed by devastating invasions from Austria and its ally Russia. In German lands, disillusionment after 1848 paved the way for experiments in dictatorship. Asked what could restore Prussian authority, Otto von Bismarck, sitting at a piano, played the Prussian infantry's charge march. He later said, ''The great questions of the age are not decided by speeches and majority decisions -- that was the big mistake of 1848 and 1849 -- but by blood and iron.'' In France, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, the callow nephew of the famous conqueror, launched a coup d'etat in 1851, rounded up dissenters and installed himself as Emperor Napoleon III. Rapport sees in 1848 the ''germinating bulbs'' of European authoritarianism. 
 He tells a good yarn, with a keen eye for ground-level details, like the ''constitutional pastries'' produced by revolution-minded Viennese bakers. Still, while trying to keep readers from getting lost in the deepening blizzard of revolts and interventions, Rapport sometimes strains for writerly effect, as when he calls Napoleon ''the incorrigible Emperor'' -- a cutesy description of a military tyrant seen by many Russians at the time as the anti-Christ incarnate. He also stumbles when he says that Metternich ''was not troubled'' by the Greek rebellion against Ottoman rule; in fact, the Austrian minister described it as ''six years of torments.'' 
 It's hard to read this book without feeling a deepening reverence for successful postrevolutionaries like Nelson Mandela and Vaclav Havel, who first made revolution and then made the unheroic compromises that are the lifeblood of actual democratic government. People will always thrill to utopian demands for perfection, from Mazzini to Che. But it's what comes next that counts: the daily humdrum of effective governance.

HEADLINE: New York City Ballet: Cutting a Company's Core

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''A Season on Point, High and Low'' by Alastair Macaulay [March 1]: 
 As a fan of New York City Ballet since 1968, it saddens me that I found myself in agreement with much of Mr. Macaulay's summary of the previous season. 
 On the plus side, the company still provides evenings of great enjoyment. Dancers like Maria Kowroski, Sara Mearns, Teresa Reichlen and Robert Fairchild give promise that Balanchine's legacy will persist. 
 But in these economic times I have to ask, what exactly is the responsibility of the board? Keeping principals who rarely dance on the payroll when 11 corps dancers -- the backbone of any company -- lose their jobs seems unconscionable. Is the board following the pattern of other corporate boards that routinely rubber-stamp the decisions of management to the detriment of the institution? Those of us who support the company with ticket purchases and contributions deserve an explanation.

HEADLINE: Becoming Next Leader of N.F.L. Union Won't Be Last Test

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
Perhaps one good thing will come out of the bare-knuckles campaign to be the next executive director of the N.F.L. Players Association: the winner of Sunday's election in Hawaii will be in fighting shape for the coming contract negotiations with team owners. 
 ''Whoever has the political skill to emerge will also have the requisite skill to heal the wounds and forge consensus,'' said Leigh Steinberg, a longtime agent and observer of union matters. ''Players express themselves dramatically. 
 ''Even though feelings get bruised in the selection process, I think very quickly, because ultimately the stakes are so high -- they have their whole economic future at stake -- there will be consensus forged.''
 The ferocity of the maneuvering to succeed Gene Upshaw, who died in August shortly after receiving a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, underscores how unprepared the union was to go on without him. It had no succession plan. 
 Complicating the search was Upshaw's falling out with Troy Vincent, a former union president who was once perceived as Upshaw's successor.
 Vincent is one of the four finalists and began the campaign as the front-runner. But he has also been the subject of months of allegations and insinuations -- often in the form of anonymous leaks to the news media -- questioning everything from how he runs his businesses to how he conducts himself. The union also hired a lawyer to investigate an allegation that Vincent released confidential information about player agents. 
 ''The process has been a journey, but through it all, I have never lost sight of what is most important -- the membership and the individual men who comprise our organization,'' Vincent said in an e-mail message. 
 His competition comes from Trace Armstrong, also a former union president. Armstrong works closely with the agent Tom Condon, who was Upshaw's agent. Armstrong is viewed as the candidate most likely to keep the current union hierarchy intact, but other agents, many of whom resent Condon's influence, could advise their clients to shift from Armstrong. 
 The other two candidates are DeMaurice Smith, a well-connected, Washington-based, white-collar criminal defense lawyer; and David Cornwell, a former lawyer for the N.F.L. with extensive experience representing players in drug cases. They will probably have to overcome the feeling among players that only someone who has taken the field can adequately represent their interests. 
 The 32 player representatives, who began gathering in Maui late last week, will hear presentations from the four candidates Saturday, then meet with them before voting begins. A simple majority of 17 wins the election. Vincent has considerable support, but if no candidate is able to garner enough votes on several ballots, the door could open for a compromise candidate -- like Cornwell or Smith. 
 Cornwell, in a letter to the union's president, Kevin Mawae, described the search as ''corrosive,'' and agents and players agree that healing the rifts that have surfaced in the last seven months will be critical before negotiations begin with the owners. The 2009 season will be the final one with a salary cap unless a new deal is reached early next year. If not, the 2010 season would be played without a salary cap. Then the deal would run out, creating the still-remote possibility of games not being played in 2011.
 Negotiations will be complicated by the feeling-out process between the owners and the new union leadership -- expect plenty of posturing from both sides -- and by the economic meltdown that is squeezing teams' margins and could threaten future revenue. 
 Still, before the union can look ahead, it must first conclude a process that several player representatives said has made the union look bad. 
 ''I'm hopeful that whoever is elected, that he begins to restore relationships and unite the groups,'' Vincent said. ''It's critical that the men get behind their new elected executive director. Time is of the essence with 2010 being an uncapped year. Both organizations fully understand what's at stake -- that being labor peace.''
 Reunifying the players before negotiations heat up may not be as difficult as it appears, Steinberg says. Most labor negotiations go down to the wire, so the new executive director will have a full season to pull players together before crunch time next March, when the new league year will begin. And although the search process has had plenty of intrigue, Steinberg says he suspects few rank-and-file players have paid much attention.
 ''I don't think the majority of players at this point in the off-season are hyperfocused on this,'' Steinberg said. ''This is the point when every player decides they are going to retire, they want to collapse, they want to play golf, they want to be on vacation. The off-season conditioning programs haven't even started.''
 After Sunday, the union may finally be able to get back in shape, too.

HEADLINE: Key Spring 2009 A Cold season in theHamptons

BYLINE: By ANDREW RICE. 
Andrew Rice is a contributing writer. His book about a Ugandan murder trial, ''The Teeth May Smile but the Heart Does Not Forget,'' will be published in May.

 BODY:
ON OSBORNE AVENUE in the village of Southampton, a cozy cedar-sided house peeks out over a modest hedgerow, a coy signifier of means in this storied summer retreat of New York's moneyed classes. A blue real estate broker's sign is planted at the foot of the driveway: the house is up for sale for the fourth time in eight years. Its churning transaction history tells the tale of a dizzying decade. In 2001, it sold for $460,000; two years later, it went for $850,000; and in 2006, after a substantial renovation, it turned over again, fetching $1.65 million. The current owners of the house, a young Manhattan couple, moved on to bigger things after a couple of summers, purchasing a $4 million home south of the Montauk Highway, about a mile closer to the shore. They put the house on Osborne Avenue up for sale again, asking nearly $2.2 million -- almost five times the property's market value at the beginning of the decade. 
 The Osborne Avenue house hit the real estate market at the end of the summer of 2007, a season that can be said, with the benefit of retrospect, to have marked the sweaty height of a speculative fever. That was the summer that the average cost of a home in the Hamptons shattered the $2 million barrier, the one when Ron Baron, a mutual-fund manager, paid a record $103 million for a 40-acre oceanfront estate. At the time, there were already alarming signs of a downturn in the national housing market, as a crisis took shape in the subprime-mortgage sector and economists predicted a coming onslaught of foreclosures. But that didn't cause much worry in the Hamptons. The bubble might be bursting off in Sun Belt subdivisions, but not in the playground of the Wall Street elite. Prices were propelled upward by a tautological justification: if you were rich enough to buy in the Hamptons, you were, by definition, a superior judge of the market.
 Then came the dreary series of events that we can summarize, as Hamptons people do, by reciting a litany of names: Bear Stearns; Fannie and Freddie; Lehman; Madoff. Since the peak, as one horrific episode after another has unfolded, the area's real estate market has mirrored Wall Street's plunging fortunes. Average sale prices have declined by about 10 percent, but that only hints at the seriousness of the trouble, because hardly anything is moving. According to data collected by the Suffolk Research Service, a local real estate data company, the number of sales in 2008 fell by 25 percent in East Hampton, 39 percent in Bridgehampton, 45 percent in Southampton and 47 percent in Montauk. Things really collapsed during the fall. Investment bankers lost their jobs, corporate lawyers saw their client base vaporize and hedge-fund managers went from being hailed as geniuses to being hauled in front of Congressional committees. ''Until the market improves or their mental state improves, they're not buying anything,'' says Herb Phillips, a veteran real estate agent who is also chairman of the Southampton town zoning board. ''It's dead.'' 
 Winter is always a low time in the Hamptons: the restaurants are empty, the streets are free of cars and a cold wind whips in off the Atlantic. On a chilly Saturday in December, I visited the house on Osborne Avenue, which by that time had been on the market for more than a year. An open house was scheduled for noon, but when I got there shortly before 1 p.m., I found the place locked, its windows dark. After a moment, the sellers' broker, Maryanne Robinson of Prudential Douglas Elliman, spotted me and popped out of a car idling nearby. She opened the house's front door, pushing aside a stack of mail that had accumulated on the entryway floor, and showed me around. The decor was nautical, with mermaid posters hanging on the walls and a chandelier of cascading seashells. 
 ''This is sort of like a Hamptons starter home,'' Robinson said -- just three bedrooms with an additional guest cottage out back. She told me that the owners had reduced their price considerably, to $1.85 million, but felt no urgency. In the Hamptons, she said, ''we tend to see people that don't really need to sell.''
 Nonetheless, by the next week, the price of the Osborne Avenue house would be slashed another $50,000 -- dropping it close to the owners' probable break-even point once you figure in taxes, closing costs and accrued mortgage interest. (In a one-sentence e-mail message, the Manhattan couple declined to comment and requested that they not be named in this article.) In January, a plaintive note appeared on the page listing the home on the Elliman Web site: ''Owner wants an offer at least $1,700,000 by Feb. 15.'' That didn't happen, so the price was cut again.
 Reducing expectations -- and even contemplating losses -- has become routine for sellers. At the end of last summer, Joseph Gregory, the former president of Lehman Brothers, put his Bridgehampton mansion up for sale for $32.5 million; finding no takers, he is reportedly considering renting it out. Even John Paulson, the hedge-fund manager who made billions by betting against the housing bubble, seems to have timed his Hamptons moves poorly. Last year, after buying himself a new $41.3 million estate, he put his old place in Southampton -- advertised as a 6,800-square-foot ''cottage'' -- on the market for $19.5 million. He has since cut more than $5 million from his asking price.
 A little later on the same day I visited Osborne Avenue, I went to another open house in the exclusive East Hampton neighborhood of Georgica. A five-bedroom home was selling for a little over $5 million. ''Two years ago it was worth 6.5,'' the owner, a chatty middle-aged woman, said as she took me through rooms filled with antiques and gilt-framed oil paintings of angels and cherubs. ''But two years ago I wasn't ready to leave my husband.'' In fact, the house has been in and out of the foreclosure process -- no longer an unknown phenomenon in the Hamptons. The situation hasn't become as dire for the vast majority of sellers, but brokers say they have seen a distinct rise in the number that they delicately describe as ''motivated.'' When the rich run into financial trouble, the vacation home is often the first thing they try to unload. 
 With supply swelling and demand shriveling, those likely to take the hardest hit, industry players say, are the speculative developers who initiated projects at the peak of the boom. A final stop on my home tour took me to Captain's Neck Lane, a street in Southampton that has been the address in recent summers of many hedge-fund managers, socialites and celebrities. The shingled mansion, hidden behind a wall of 25-foot cypress trees, was priced at $6.5 million after a series of reductions. ''Everything in the Hamptons has all the new angles, and this house is full of them,'' said Mary Denny, a sales associate then with Corcoran Group Real Estate. We walked up and down two staircases, through bare spacious rooms floored with walnut and a kitchen ablaze with white calacatta marble. Denny pointed out the five fireplaces, the 850-bottle wine cellar, the heated pool and Jacuzzi. ''Everything in this house,'' she said, ''is so high quality, well done and priced to sell.'' 
 LATER ON, looking for another assessment, I called James McLauchlen, who runs a small realty firm a few blocks from the mansion on Captain's Neck Lane. He told me he thought the house was attractive but wondered whether its hypothetical buyer had vanished like so much paper wealth. ''The people who are playing in that league -- their numbers have been dramatically reduced,'' McLauchlen said. His family has been in Southampton real estate for three generations, and he watched with amazement over the course of the decade as home values increased at a rate of about 20 percent a year. ''Everyone was kind of euphoric and happy-happy,'' he said. ''Some of the old-timers in the business were scratching their heads, thinking, What is going on?''
 In years like 2006 and 2007, when Wall Street firms gave out record bonuses, the Hamptons were full of new millionaires. In time-honored fashion, the old guard groused about arrivistes who were filling their quaint villages with pumped-up new mansions. The place on Captain's Neck Lane -- 8,000 square feet configured onto a lot that's seven-tenths of an acre -- was emblematic of the trend. Now, as it sat empty, it looked like the vestige of another season.
 Catherine Lignelli, a first-time developer, built the mansion, and if she misjudged the market it wasn't because she misunderstood the newcomers' appetites. She was from their world. Her husband, Jeff Lignelli, manages a hedge fund, and their primary residence is a 22nd-floor apartment on Central Park South. In January, she met me at the headquarters of Stonebrook Fund Management, her husband's company, to talk about her entry into Hamptons real estate. Tall and blond, wearing a stylish tweed blazer, knee-high leather boots and a white cashmere scarf, Lignelli showed me into an office that overlooked Park Avenue. She told me that she had gotten into real estate because it was a career that she could pursue while raising her daughter, Alexa, who is not yet 2.
 ''My focus was quality and aesthetics for family and friends, and seamless entertaining,'' she said. ''Without sounding feminist, I think that as a mother, as a wife, I can lend a lot to the details of what it takes for effortless, organized living.''
 Lignelli has a degree in fashion design. In previous jobs, she worked as a personal assistant to the jewelry designer David Yurman and the financier Steven Schonfeld, which sometimes required her to make excursions to the Hamptons, but it was only after she met her husband that she really got to know the place. Jeff Lignelli owned a summer home in Water Mill; he proposed to her in the Hamptons in May 2005. Catherine decided that she wanted to start working for herself. ''Next to clothing, I think real estate is fascinating -- to watch that concept on your napkin sketch become someone's actual home,'' she said. ''Jeff was very excited about it. He loves the Hamptons so much.'' 
 Jeff Lignelli, who manages a number of equity-oriented funds, averaged returns of better than 15 percent between 2003 and 2005, and like all hedge-fund managers, he charged high fees. Flush with cash, he and his fiancee drove around and prospected for development sites. Over the course of two months in late 2005 and early 2006, the Lignellis paid $1.9 million for a small ranch house on Captain's Neck Lane, which was to make way for Catherine's first project; $2.3 million for a modern five-bedroom in Water Mill, which they're renting out for now; and $14.2 million for a beachfront mansion on Dune Road in Bridgehampton, which they use themselves. 
 The Lignellis' wedding was held in July 2006. Invitations, engraved into shiny metal paperweights shaped liked beach pebbles, instructed guests to join them by the ocean in front of their Bridgehampton place, at sunset, in all-white attire. Meanwhile, construction had started on Captain's Neck Lane. That summer, the real estate column in the magazine Hamptons Cottages and Gardens described activity along the street, lined with palatial structures for the eight-figure buyer, as ''hotter than hot.'' Catherine Lignelli appeared poised to reap a big profit. She threw herself into the design-and-construction process. ''I'm very, very hands-on -- every light, every piece of molding, every appliance,'' she said. ''My architect took my sketches and turned them into blueprints.''
 By the time construction was completed last summer, Lignelli could see that the economy was headed for a downturn. Nonetheless, when asked if any aspect of the building project had surprised her, she replied, ''I'm surprised it hasn't sold.'' What she didn't see coming -- what many did not see coming -- was the degree to which the crisis in the rest of the country would affect people in her world. The boom's beneficiaries had been flashing so much money that everyone assumed they were insulated from market swings. But it turned out that overleveraging wasn't just a vice of subprime borrowers. 
 Hedge funds have been hard hit by the crash. Lignelli said people in her social circle had been ''pulling the reins back.'' Her own husband's success, which created the personal wealth that underwrote her real estate investments, seems not to have been spared the general trend of reversal. (Jeff Lignelli declined to comment for this article.) Various public disclosures, including documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, suggest that Stonebrook's stock portfolio, historically concentrated in the tourism, home-building and retail sectors, has contracted significantly.
 Catherine Lignelli said the fortunes of her husband's hedge fund would have no effect on her personal enterprise, to which she expressed a deep commitment. ''People think I married someone wealthy and, 'Why not build a pretty house in the Hamptons?' '' she said. ''There is so much more to it than that. This is something that I'd like to do, probably forever.'' Since finishing the house on Captain's Neck Lane, she has lowered her price by $1.5 million but vowed that she wouldn't budge from there, no matter how bad the market got. She said she simply couldn't justify it, given the many millions she and her husband had spent to acquire the land and construct the house. ''I feel hugely responsible for giving back something to the person that financed me,'' she told me. ''I would love to give my husband a smidge of a kiss of a profit.''
 Lignelli has listed the property with two superstar brokers, Harald Grant of Sotheby's International Realty and Gary DePersia of Corcoran. But if she doesn't get that $6.5 million offer, she has a backup plan. ''Come a certain point,'' she said, ''the decision will probably be made to go ahead and rent it.''
 That might not be a bad option. Joseph Kazickas of Rosehip Partners, a real estate brokerage specializing in Hamptons rentals, said that as recently as last year, a property like the one on Captain's Neck Lane might have fetched $300,000 for the summer. Of course, before a property can be rented, it has to be furnished -- a considerable expense -- and if every other thwarted seller happens to have the same idea, rental rates will be depressed by the abundance of supply. A Web site that Kazickas runs, hamptonsrentals.com, currently lists more than 500 properties available for the summer, a number he predicts will only grow as the turmoil on Wall Street continues. 
 If rents fall precipitously, a lot of homeowners are going to face unhappy choices. A buyer who took out a $2 million mortgage at the prevailing interest rates during the summer of 2007 would now face a monthly payment of about $13,000 -- possible to swing on an investment-bank salary but not on an unemployment check. ''It's going to be very interesting to see what happens next summer,'' said John Brady, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''All of these Wall Street guys who are being let off right now -- the effect isn't going to take place for months.''
 Over the last year or so, Brady, an ambitious 31-year-old, has built a reputation for a previously unheard-of specialization: he represents financially distressed Hamptons homeowners. In a field in which brokers often belong to the same social class as those they cater to, or at least affect their manners, he is an anomaly. The son of a cop and a real estate agent, Brady grew up in the insular blue-collar part of the Hamptons that summer residents seldom see. When he was a teenager, his parents divorced, and his mother lost her home in Montauk to foreclosure. ''I just remember we had to move, and that was it, end of story,'' Brady told me. ''Foreclosure, that's how it works.''
 MOST DAYS of the week, Brady drives around the Hamptons, ringing bells at homes that are in danger of foreclosure. He gets the addresses from mortgage-default notices publicly filed by lenders or from banks' confidential lists of homeowners who are at least 30 days behind on their payments. (Lenders filed around 260 default notices, the first step in the legal process of foreclosure, against Hamptons property owners in 2008, according to PropertyShark.com, a research service. Brady says the bank list is about 1,000 names long.) To people who owe much more on their home than they're likely to get by selling in today's market, Brady suggests what's known as a short sale, in which a bank accepts a sum smaller than the mortgage in lieu of a long and costly foreclosure. 
 One winter weekend afternoon, I accompanied Brady on his rounds. We met at the Prudential Douglas Elliman office in East Hampton, which was deathly quiet. He often speaks about his profession with contempt, calling other brokers ''lazy'' and worse. The way he sees it, most of them believed their own top-of-the-boom hype and can't adjust now. ''A lot of agents don't know the truth of what's going on,'' he said. ''They never do.''
 Brady donned a heavy peacoat and picked up his ''door-knocking kit,'' which included a bag of dog treats and a can of pepper spray. (He says he's never had to use the spray.) As we drove north, he told me that he got into real estate after a stint peddling credit cards door to door in Mexico, an experience he has found surprisingly useful. 
 Up near Three Mile Harbor, he pulled into a gravel driveway that led to a lodgelike modern home set on a densely wooded lot. ''This looks nice,'' Brady said as we looked around. ''In-ground pool. Volleyball court.'' When Brady knocked, no one answered. On our way back down the driveway, we noticed a sign: the house was on the market for $1.3 million. ''A lot of people, they hear short selling and they assume it's low-income, but it's not true,'' he said. ''There's people right now overfinanced in the eight digits.''
 Although the rate of mortgage defaults, about 1 for every 160 households, ran slightly higher in the Hamptons than in New York City last year, according to an analysis compiled by PropertyShark, the percentage of homes that actually entered foreclosure remained considerably lower than that of other regional markets. Many local real estate professionals scoff at the notion that foreclosure could ever become a widespread phenomenon. Last May, Brady was interviewed on the Fox Business Network alongside Lori Barbaria, one of the area's elite brokers. When Brady described knocking on the doors of imperiled homeowners, her face crinkled with a look of disgust. ''I would never do that,'' Barbaria told the host. She said she was ''not feeling'' a serious crash.
 The optimists argue that the Hamptons should remain relatively untouched by the housing collapse because most buyers put up substantial equity, and some of the biggest deals were done in cash. However, even fully capitalized buyers often borrowed against their houses for tax purposes or other reasons, real estate professionals say, and those observers with a gloomier outlook suspect that many of those loans are currently in trouble, or will soon be. ''It's the kind of stuff that may not be hitting the public fan,'' said James McLauchlen, who often does appraisals for banks. 
 Something similar happened after the 1987 stock-market crash. ''I saw the dark days of '88 through '92,'' says Dan Gualtieri, chief executive of the Hamptons Mortgage Corporation, ''and it impacted a lot of people you wouldn't have expected.'' Reading the darkening forecasts, Elliman -- which typically markets itself with glossy photographs of baronial estates -- has recently started to advertise John Brady's short-selling expertise in The East Hampton Star and other local newspapers.
 We pulled up to another East Hampton house: an old place, cedar exterior, big front porch, right in the center of the village -- a real find. A gray-haired man wearing shorts and a paint-splattered T-shirt answered the door and, after Brady's introduction, invited us inside a comfortable home filled with books. His name was Patrick Stolmeier, and he was a builder who had hit hard times since construction work dried up. Sitting in the kitchen, he and Brady talked for an hour. Stolmeier was selling the house himself, asking $1.6 million -- an open house was scheduled for the next day. Brady laid out his options. Stolmeier said he understood his predicament, but he couldn't just give away the house. It represented his retirement.
 ''Eighty cents on the dollar would be great,'' Stolmeier said, ''if we're talking about the 2005 price.''
 There's the crux of the problem. No one knows what anything is worth anymore. Herb Phillips, a real estate broker who has been around for almost 30 years, told me he's using a simple formula to appraise the value of homes, taking their worth before the boom and figuring in a yearly rate of 7 percent appreciation. If you follow his logic, a home that sold for $450,000 in 2001 should be worth about $800,000 today -- not a bad investment, unless you happened to pay $1.5 million for it in 2006. It's quite possible, if Phillips is right, that a large percentage of the people who bought at the top of the market owe their banks more than their houses are worth. Until the market unfreezes, however, it's impossible to really know any home's value.
 A couple of weeks after Brady visited him, I called Patrick Stolmeier to see how his open house had gone. ''Absolutely nobody showed,'' he said. Nonetheless, he remained hopeful that he would eventually sell the house and escape foreclosure -- this was, after all, the Hamptons. ''This still has the cachet of being the playground of the rich and famous,'' he said. ''It's when the number of rich and famous dwindle that we're suffering.''
 Like most homeowners who default, Stolmeier blamed an unfortunate confluence of events for his inability to pay his mortgage. A veteran builder, he specializes in high-end construction, often incorporating ecologically sensitive technologies. He bought his house, on Cooper Lane, in 1988, for $270,000. Later, as a personal project, he started renovating a home in the Northwest Woods area of East Hampton. He refinanced his primary residence, borrowing $523,000, in part to create capital for the second project, but then he caught an unlucky break: he contracted Lyme disease. He started to have trouble paying his mortgages, despite adjustments to his payment plan. He was finally recovering from his health problems when the downturn came with a rush. He returned home from a vacation in August 2007 and discovered that three lucrative jobs had disappeared.
 Before long, Stolmeier was unable to make the monthly payment on the mortgage for his Cooper Lane house. He and his mortgage servicer, Ocwen Financial Corporation, entered a long struggle over loan modifications. His life became consumed by a maddening series of phone calls invariably answered at an Ocwen call center in India. After many months of conflicting answers, Stolmeier thought he was close to a new loan modification in November. Then a process server surprised him on his driveway and served him with foreclosure papers filed on behalf of the holders of the mortgage-backed security into which his loan had been bundled. Paul Koches, Ocwen's general counsel, said that the servicer had been patient but ultimately had to act in the interest of the bondholders. The legal action is delayed for now, but because the Cooper Lane house would be worth a sizable amount on the open market -- probably a great deal more than Stolmeier owes -- it makes more financial sense for the lender to foreclose than to accept an unfavorable change in payment terms. ''It's a delicate balance,'' Koches said, ''and not always an easy one to strike.''
 Meanwhile, Stolmeier has been having similar problems with his uncompleted Northwest Woods house, where he was hoping to live when he retired. ''Both of these houses represent a great percentage of the product of my adult life, and I can't turn my back on that,'' said Stolmeier, who is 60. ''It took an awful lot of work for a blue-collar guy to buy these properties.''
 John Brady said he thought that, in the end, Stolmeier would probably be able to settle his problems by selling the Cooper Lane house. ''Really, all he needs to do is drop the price,'' the broker said, ''and he gets out.'' Of course, this returns us to the case of the missing buyer -- no matter how reasonable the price, if no one is making offers, you can't sell. 
 Many Hamptons brokers talk optimistically about 2009, predicting a wave of bargain hunters. ''Within the last month I've been approached by two hedge-fund guys -- they asked me to keep on the lookout for advantageous buys,'' said Gary DePersia, one broker who is trying to sell Catherine Lignelli's mansion. If the buyers don't return soon, however, the implications for the Hamptons market are sobering. 
 One blustery December morning, I went to the Southampton Town Hall to see what the future might hold if the doomsayers are to be believed. A home with a $1.5 million mortgage, and recently foreclosed, was going up for auction. As I waited for the proceeding to begin, I met the wife of the home's owner, a real estate broker, who looked on sadly as a referee, Charles D'Onofrio III, read out the terms of the sale and asked, ''Are there any bids?'' The only other person on the steps, a representative of the bank, offered the token sum of $500.
 ''Sold,'' the referee barked.
 Later that morning, I went to see the foreclosed property. It was a classic Hamptons spec house, all shingles and bay windows, and it looked as if it had never been finished. The wind gusted through tall pines as I walked around the lot, which was littered with construction debris. The home was empty inside, except for a couple of chairs. Off the back deck, a swimming pool sat murky and neglected. Summer seemed a long way away.

 ANN HARRINGTON, a mother of two, was in the library here one day carrying a half-dozen DVDs, including ''A Few Good Men'' and ''The Upside of Anger,'' as well as the inspirational football film ''Facing the Giants,'' which her whole family could watch.
 Not long ago, the DVDs might have come from a video rental store or the family might have taken in a movie at the multiplex, but with the economy faltering Ms. Harrington is being more careful. She is married to a freelance illustrator who, she said, has noticed the number of assignments he gets slipping.
 ''I tend to try the library and take out more of the DVDs rather than go to Blockbuster,'' Ms. Harrington said. 
 Her decision to exercise some gentle frugality by taking advantage of her town's library illustrates one upside to the economic downturn: Libraries are booming. Indeed, the bad news on the economy is good news for libraries across the New York region -- so long as they can escape the budget ax that is falling on many municipal services as cities and towns struggle with declining revenue.
 People are flocking to libraries after forsaking Barnes & Noble or ditching their HBO service and subscriptions to Netflix, library officials said, because libraries' books, DVDs and CDs have a significant advantage: They are free. 
 Some people are showing up at the library for the first time for free entertainment -- movies, lectures, concerts and puppet shows, library officials said. Still others are capitalizing on their newspaper racks, books and free Internet service for job searches and investment advice or advice on a topic that the title of a much-thumbed book makes obvious: ''Surviving a Layoff: A Week-by-Week Guide to Getting your Life Back Together.''
 ''It's a fabulous time to be a librarian,'' said Maura Ritz, the town librarian in Fairfield, where borrowing went up 8 percent in the second half of last year compared with the same period in 2007, and where the number of new cardholders rose 10 percent. ''We feel a real responsibility to respond to the need of the community.''
 There is an incongruity in libraries' providing such a wealth of free services because libraries themselves are vulnerable to the economy. Towns and school districts have started to make cuts, and library hours and employees are frequent targets, though so far most of the cuts seem manageable, library officials said. 
 Librarians said they had not had to make major increases in purchases of books and DVDs, only shrewder ones -- buying extra copies of, say, a John Grisham novel and cutting back on books that might not have as large a readership.
 But for now libraries are welcoming their new popularity.
 The Ridgefield Library noted a 7 percent rise in checkouts in the last six months of 2008 -- after the brunt of the economic meltdown and people's realization of it.
 In the Westchester County hamlet of Chappaqua, Pamela C. Thornton, the library director, said that circulation in December was up 22.3 percent from December 2007, with patrons checking out 35,692, books, DVDs, CDs and other items. At the Ridgefield Library, 211,500 items, 60 percent of them books, were borrowed in the second half of 2008. 
 People who once might have turned to Barnes & Noble or Amazon if their local library did not have a book are now asking librarians to search the entire county system, said Robert Gadue, business manager of the Suffolk Collaborative Library System on Long Island. ''As the economy shrinks,'' he said, ''you always see an increase in library usage.''
 Librarians said they were noticing more older people getting library cards for the first time or sheepishly explaining that they had lost their cards. Others have been paying long-neglected late fees so they can use the library's free Internet service.
 The growth in library use is apparent across the New York region.
 One day, Shira Weiss, a 34-year-old publicist, showed up, with her two children, at the library in Teaneck, N.J., for the first time in years after her husband gently inquired why she needed to spend so much on books. She applied for a card and -- after taking out two chick-lit novels, an illustrated ''Star Wars'' book for her 5-year-old, Jake, and two animal books for her 2-year-old, Ben -- instinctively pulled out her wallet to pay.
 ''I guess it will take an adjustment period until I realize that some of the best things in life are indeed free,'' Ms. Weiss said.
 The Bergen County Cooperative Library System, a consortium of 75 libraries in northern New Jersey, reported an 8.2 percent increase in borrowing in 2008, with nearly 10.9 million items taken out last year. 
 Robert White, the director of the Bergen County network, said he had calculated that ''the average yearly value to every card used in our system was $706.''
 ''You don't get that kind of rebate on the Discover Card,'' he said. ''And it's all free.''
 In Ridgefield, an affluent town where many residents work at nearby companies like Pepsi, General Electric and I.B.M., people are tapping the library's free services even if they are financially comfortable enough for now, library officials said.
 ''I just think people are hunkering down,'' said Christina Nolan, the library's director. ''They may not have to cut out Netflix, but they're choosing to do so because they don't know what's around the corner.''
 Ms. Nolan said attendance was up 20 percent at the library's abundant -- and free -- weekend and weeknight programs, with residents opting for those rather than tickets to Broadway or Lincoln Center or a movie at the multiplex. Ms. Nolan has shown the Batman movie ''The Dark Knight'' and ''Man on Wire,'' the documentary about the Twin Towers tightrope walker, to packed houses of about 100 people, something she said would not have happened a year ago. 
 Last fall in Chappaqua, a showing of ''Waitress,'' with a sweetener of 15 pies to highlight a movie motif, brought out 95 people. ''They're giving up movie packages on cable TV and coming to me,'' Ms. Thornton said.
 In Ridgefield, Geri Diorio, the head of children's services, said that on many days she noticed twice as many mothers and fathers coming in with children for ''Storytime.'' 
 ''Rather than, 'Let's wander the mall!' it's 'Let's go to the library!' '' Ms. Diorio said. ''I'm also seeing a lot more dads at Storytime.'' 
 One of the mothers at Storytime was Alice Weiner, who has signed up her three children, ages 3, 5 and 7.
 ''It's another good activity that doesn't cost,'' she said. ''Instead of going to the bookstore, we come here. A hardcover children's book costs $16.'' 
 Fewer au pairs are bringing children in because some stay-at-home mothers are doing without such help, librarians in Ridgefield said. And Karen B. Ronald, the deputy town librarian in Fairfield, said that as fewer parents are able to afford nursery schools and other day care, and some providers are closing, more parents are spending the day with their toddlers at the library.
 In Ridgefield and Chappaqua, families are signing up for free passes to places like the Museum of Natural History and the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, library officials said.
 Ms. Nolan said she had observed that people in Ridgefield who have lost jobs in a town where two-acre zoning can isolate them are finding their way to the library to seek congenial company.
 ''The library is used as a gathering place for people who are intelligent and have similar values sothey're not as isolated,'' she said. ''We have days that 1,400 people come through our doors. That's a lot for a town of 24,000.''
 With unemployment rising, the jobless are flocking to the library for help in finding work, switching careers, brushing up resumes or checking the financial ratings of companies that are advertising for help, library officials said. In Fairfield, Ms. Ritz said, the library is running a 15-session series on job-hunting skills like networking, resume revamping and interviews, and each session has been attended by 70 to 90 people.
 On a recent day at the East Meadow Public Library, on Long Island, four of the nine Internet-ready computers were being used for job searches.
 One of the searchers was Gary Eisele, 54, who lost his job as a customer service representative for American Home Mortgage Investment, a firm that filed for bankruptcy in 2007. Mr. Eisle, one of 1,400 people let go on Long Island, was checking help-wanted ads on Monster.com and CareerBuilder.com in the library because, he said, he could no longer afford home Internet service.
 ''There's an awful lot of people working on their resume, checking their e-mail,'' said Mary Rindfleisch, the Ridgefield Library's assistant director. ''I've had conversations with individuals for whom this is their office.''
 Some libraries are changing their buying patterns. In Chappaqua, the library is stocking more popular titles because people have cut back on book purchases, Ms. Thornton said. 
 ''If it's a best seller, instead of buying two copies perhaps we'll buy four,'' she said.
 When ''Slumdog Millionaire'' started winning its haul of best picture awards, Michael McCue, director of the Teaneck Public Library, bought copies of the book it is based on. He said he knew there would be requests the next day.
 While meeting patrons' needs, libraries are facing austerity themselves. Ridgefield's library, with a $2 million budget, has been hit with a $60,000 cut this year, which it has been able to absorb with small adjustments. But officials there worry about what may happen when the town votes on its budget in May. To give itself a cushion, the library raised late fees to 25 cents from 10 cents.
 Nonetheless, Ms. Nolan said she thinks that sustaining free services is essential. 
 ''A library is the people's university,'' she said. ''From cradle to grave, you can come here and learn about ballet, astronomy, gem cutting or whatever you want.''

HEADLINE: Do You Have Philip Glass In a Box?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
THE challenges facing the beleaguered CD retail business continue. 
 First there was the demise of Tower Records. Now the two Virgin Megastores in New York, in Times Square and Union Square, will close this spring. The future of the recording industry lies with downloading, trends suggest. It is not hard to find music lovers in their 20s who have never bought a physical CD.
 Yet recording companies, especially classical ones, continue to churn out CDs, and not just single discs but multidisc boxed sets. To commemorate the centennial of the conductor Herbert von Karajan last year, for example, Deutsche Grammophon released a 38-CD box of his recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic, including the complete symphonies of Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Tchaikovsky and Bruckner; Haydn's ''Paris'' and ''London'' Symphonies; and the last six Mozart symphonies. 
 It was marketed as a special limited edition, and about 35,000 copies were issued. Who would buy this daunting collection? 
 Quite a few consumers, it turns out. In a recent telephone interview Michael Lang, the president of Deutsche Grammophon, said the company expected the entire limited edition to sell out by this fall, a year after it became available. 
 ''Europe and Japan have always been box-set crazy,'' he said. ''And Karajan is an iconic figure in music.'' To attract not just specialist purchasers but also newcomers to classical music, this ''low-frills'' set, as Mr. Lang called it, was released at a budget price, $99.98, which breaks down to $2.63 per disc, a bargain. 
 For Karajan devotees or for those who want the main symphonic works of Western classical music in a compact, affordable package, this release would seem enticing. Still, immersing newcomers in one conductor's take on so much repertory, however great that conductor and his orchestra, is a little weird. 
 Given the global economic challenges and the trend toward downloading, this might seem an inopportune time to be releasing boxed sets. Still they keep coming, comprehensive surveys of a performer or a composer and sundry collections of more questionable marketability. 
 A typically baffling set, released last year by Nonesuch, is the ''Glass Box.'' This 10-CD retrospective of Philip Glass's works is a six-inch-square box, an oversize thing adorned with glossy photos and too bulky for a standard CD shelf. All Mr. Glass's important operas, symphonic works and chamber pieces are represented, though sometimes only in extended excerpts, a curious decision on Nonesuch's part. You would think that someone interested in ''Satyagraha'' would want the complete opera. The ''Glass Box'' sells for about $100, still a reasonable $10 per disc, though hardly the bargain of the Karajan set. Again the question arises: Who is the target consumer? 
 Asked about the ''Glass Box,'' Robert Hurwitz, the president of Nonesuch, one of the most adventurous classical music companies of the last 50 years, said, ''I could take either the blame or the credit for that one.'' He wanted to keep the set within the 10-CD format that had worked well for Steve Reich and John Adams boxes, which also included excerpts of certain works and sold strongly. Mr. Hurwitz compared the ''Glass Box'' to a museum exhibition. ''The philosophy is to look at a body of musical works in the same way,'' he said.
 Many who study recording industry trends have said that as consumers increasingly download individual CDs, boxed sets could have more allure than ever, especially for collectors of classical music. To understand why, you have to go back to the early days of the CD, when a plastic-coated disc holding 70-plus minutes of music free of surface noise seemed wondrous. 
 Special boxed sets, once they started appearing, were more wondrous still. In a box roughly 5 inches high and 1 1/2 inches wide you could pick up Murray Perahia's elegant recordings of the 27 piano concertos of Mozart with the English Chamber Orchestra. Consumers were enticed by the blend of completeness and compactness. 
 Completeness has resulted in some releases of great archival value. To acknowledge the centennial of Messiaen's birth last year Deutsche Grammophon issued a 32-CD set with, essentially, Messiaen's complete works. Though a few pieces had to be recorded new, most were compiled from the company's extensive catalog. 
 There are classic performances here, like the conductor Kent Nagano's account of the landmark opera ''St. Francois d'Assise'' with the Halle Orchestra and a stellar cast headed by Jose van Dam. There is the recording of the ecstatic work for two pianos ''Visions de l'Amen,'' played by Messiaen and his wife, Yvonne Loriod. The box includes a 378-page book with interviews, essays and texts to the vocal works. It lists for $255, a reasonable price, given the richness of the contents. 
 There is a devoted, if limited, market for such a release. Just as Shakespeare fans want a complete edition of the plays on their shelf -- even if they never get around to reading, say, ''Henry VI, Part III'' -- Messiaen lovers will want to have this box in their collections. Company executives are loath to divulge the size of limited-edition runs, but Mr. Lang said the Messiaen set had so far sold about 6,000 copies, an impressive number.
 But what is the concept behind the Sony/BMG box of Vladimir Horowitz recordings released last year? This is part of a series of 10-CD sets called ''The Original Jacket Collection.'' Within the box each CD is enclosed in a cardboard jacket: an exact copy of a historic LP jacket. Fair enough, except that the content of the CD does not always match the list of works printed on the original jacket. 
 So -- and bear with me here -- the ''Horowitz on Tour'' jacket lists performances of works by Clementi, Chopin and Rachmaninoff, recorded in 1979 and 1980. But if you check the enclosed book, you find that the CD is actually all Chopin. It offers spectacular performances, including a breathtaking account of the Andante Spianato and Grande Polonaise, recorded way back in 1945. Go figure. 
 ''We tried to honor the original intent of the original jacket,'' Alex Miller, senior vice president and general manager of Sony Masterworks, said in a recent telephone interview. ''The idea was to produce a tactile piece that evoked nostalgia.'' Because CDs can hold much more music than the original LPs, bonus works have been added to each disc. In the enclosed program book a disclaimer explains that disconnect between the jacket and its contents. But what a muddle.
 Sometimes a company will issue a set on principle. In February, in honor of Elliott Carter's 100th birthday, Nonesuch released a four-CD collection of its pioneering recordings of Carter orchestral, chamber and solo works, made between 1968 and 1990 and featuring a roster of Carter champions, including the pianists Ursula Oppens, Paul Jacobs and Gilbert Kalish; the cellist Joel Krosnick; and the Contemporary Chamber Ensemble, with Arthur Weisberg conducting. 
 Mr. Hurwitz expects this set to sell satisfactorily, he said. But if it does not, so be it. ''We have had a lot of longstanding relationships with important composers and performers over the years,'' he added. ''At different times it seems to me to make sense to put together recordings without thinking about a target audience.''
 Mr. Miller, at Sony Masterworks, is a big believer in comprehensiveness as a commodity in the box-set business. Last year a collection of the pianist Glenn Gould's recordings for Columbia, nearly 80 discs, represented a merger of ''good art and good commerce,'' he said. The first run was approximately 20,000, and it sold out.
 Get ready, Yo-Yo Ma fans. In October, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Mr. Ma's association with the company, Sony will issue a deluxe box set of this essential cellist's recordings. ''It will be a complete look, up to this moment, at what Yo-Yo Ma has done,'' Mr. Miller said, ''plus some additional new materials, a photo essay book -- about 88 CDs in all.'' From that release, he added, smaller subsets will be broken out and offered separately. 
 And if that sounds like overdoing it, in this Haydn year there are several Haydn projects. Naxos is releasing a series of boxed sets presenting Haydn's works by genre. This fall the distinguished company Harmonia Mundi issued the first installment of ''A Haydn Celebration, 1809-2009,'' which will include volumes of the master's works, a documentary film, a deluxe double-CD book about Haydn and his times and much more. This project is closer to a multimedia course in Haydn than a series of box sets. 
 Finally, in another enterprising project to lure consumers with comprehensive collections, Brilliant Classics has issued a 150-CD Haydn Edition: symphonies, concertos, Masses, songs, chamber works and more, compiled from recordings by some eminent artists (like the soprano Elly Ameling) and many lesser-known performers. You, too, could have the complete Haydn baryton trios on your shelf.
 My guess is that, rather than playing to the collector's feeling for tangible CDs, this 14-inch-wide, eight-pound rectangular set may hasten the move to downloading. Where do you store it?
