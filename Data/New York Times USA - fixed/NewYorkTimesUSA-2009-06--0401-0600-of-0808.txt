HEADLINE: Second Opinions on Medical Tourism

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Regarding ''Overseas, Under the Knife,'' by Arnold Milstein, Mark D. Smith and Jerome P. Kassirer (Op-Ed, June 10):
 Suppose health care overseas is the same quality as ours here. And take for granted that it's cheaper, as the writers point out.
 Does all that make medical tourism a good thing? Not really, I'm afraid. 
 Here in the United States, hospitals lose revenue. That's dollars that used to cross-subsidize emergency rooms, charity care and chronic medical admissions for sick citizens here.
 Overseas, health care markets get distorted. That means tertiary care (read, fancy technology) when they really need to invest in primary care. It means emerging economies focus on the affluent, not the indigent. On private, not public care.
 Now go back to those assumptions about quality and cost. When I teach my students here about medical tourism, I spend a lot of time challenging those assumptions. 
 Caveat emptor, as always.

 To the Editor:
 Arnold Milstein, Mark D. Smith and Jerome P. Kassirer speculate about the possible benefits of offshore surgery to American health care. They examine the potential risks for Americans, and weigh these against the cost savings for the United States.
 Alas, they have nothing to say about the effects of so-called medical tourism on the countries most concerned. One wonders what happens to the health of people in countries like India and Thailand, with their vast populations of impoverished citizens living without access to any health care, when doctors and nurses trained by -- and at the expense of -- those nations end up treating patients from the world's richest countries.
 Are we in the wealthy world really so blind and selfish that it does not even occur to us to ask to what extent medical tourism, in the end, boils down to poor countries subsidizing the cost of health care for rich countries? 
 Francois Furstenberg Montreal, June 10, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Medical tourism is certainly intriguing. While this approach may be appealing from a cost-savings perspective, I wonder about the quality of the services provided.
 It's not just about the hospitals themselves. 
 What about the blood supplies that the hospital uses? How safe are they? What tests are done? Who is the supplier of those joints and stents, and what kind of regulation and oversight are there on the companies making them?
 And finally, are the data about those hospitals available to consumers so they can compare infection rates and treatment outcomes among the various hospitals?

 To the Editor: 
 The American medical industry should view with concern the offshoring of medical care. When foreign cars began appearing with greater frequency in the 1960s, Detroit mostly dismissed them as filling a small niche for people who wanted cheap, perhaps inferior transportation. But the cars got better, and look who is commanding the market today. 
 The big threat to American medicine will come not from places halfway around the globe, but from Cuba after Fidel and Raul Castro's rule disappears. The Cuban medical industry, already well regarded if not yet state of the art, with investment in modern training and equipment, will be very able to compete with American medicine.
 When a very low-cost alternative is only a few hours away, what patients, or their insurance companies, will opt for the luxury of American care? 
 Jim Stahl Orange Village, Ohio, June 10, 2009
 To the Editor:
 During my four-day quiet stay in a Swiss private clinic, staff stopped by frequently and served homemade meals. The surgeon visited on both Saturday and Sunday. The only paperwork that I had to complete was my signature on the safe deposit box. In this expensive country, my room was $500 per day. 
 This experience was a bit surprising as my prior encounters with hospitals had been limited to American institutions. Lower malpractice premiums and awards may help keep costs down, but they are not the only factors. In this era of globalization, one wonders why hospital managers do not examine what works well in other countries.
 While there is great respect for American medical research and expertise, there is a general fear that American-style health care delivery practices will eventually find their way here. Let us hope that it is the other way around. 
 Colleen McGarry Geneva, June 11, 2009
 To the Editor:
 So have the economic conditions that brought us the ''stay-cation'' now given rise to the ''med-cation''?

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
Who really designed Bethpage Black, the site of this year's United States Open, which begins on Thursday? In most golfing circles, it's practically sacred writ that the course, which opened in 1936, is the last, and possibly greatest, achievement of A. W. Tillinghast, who also designed such New York-area masterpieces as Winged Foot, Baltusrol, Ridgewood and Quaker Ridge. But in 2002, Ron Whitten, a columnist for Golf Digest, argued that Bethpage Black was actually the work of Joseph Burbeck, the superintendent of Bethpage State Park during its construction, and in the June issue of Golf Digest he repeats the claim.
 For Tillinghast fans, who tend to be passionate in their devotion, this is a little like arguing that Shakespeare didn't write ''The Tempest,'' and the debate, waged on golf blogs and in salvos of essays, has taken on some of the characteristics of the feud between the Stratfordians, who believe in the Bard of Avon, and the Oxfordians, who insist the Earl of Oxford wrote the plays. 
 In this case, the key evidence for the Oxford side is that Tillinghast's contract called for him to work as a consultant, not an architect, for just 15 days; that the work of laying out three new courses at Bethpage (a fourth was already there) had begun under Burbeck before Tillinghast came on board; and that Tillinghast later credited Burbeck with the idea of creating Bethpage Black as a kind of municipal Mecca, a rival to Pine Valley. 
 The Stratfordians, of whom the most knowledgeable and eloquent is probably Tillinghast's biographer, Philip Young, believe that Tilly, as he was known, was on the site for longer than the contract stipulated, and that the only reason he wasn't officially in charge of day-to-day operations was that Bethpage was built by an army of W.P.A. workers, and not, as was customary, by his own construction company.
 ''I don't argue that Tillinghast wasn't involved,'' Whitten said on Monday. ''But I think Burbeck deserves credit as the architect of record, with Tillinghast as a consultant.'' He added: ''I'm basing it on facts. Those who love Tillinghast are arguing from emotion. They don't want their man sharing credit with anyone.''
 Frank Hannigan, the former head of the United States Golf Association, said that even now it's sometimes hard to tell who's responsible for what on a golf course. ''In truth, there are a lot of famous builders, including some professional golfers, who probably don't do as much as Tillinghast did,'' he said.
 Just like Shakespeare scholars, the golf Stratfordians appeal to what might be called textual evidence. Some argue that Bethpage is a masterwork, unlikely to have been created by a novice. Most point to the way many of the holes at Bethpage echo others Tillinghast designed or illustrate his design principles. 
 This is somewhat subjective ground because everyone agrees that unlike Donald Ross, famous for his domed greens, or C. B. Macdonald, who tended to reproduce his favorite holes on all his courses, Tillinghast had no signature style. He would build deep bunkers on one course, flatter ones on another. His greens were sometimes deeply contoured, as at Winged Foot, and sometimes not. (''A putting green has features just like a human,'' he wrote. ''There are some with rugged profiles which loom head and shoulders above the common herd.'') 
 He let the terrain shape his courses and was one of the first to introduce the principles of landscape architecture into course design. He thought holes should be visually appealing as well as challenging to play, and once wrote: ''A round of golf should provide 18 inspirations, not necessarily thrills, because spectacular holes may be sadly overdone. ... When I speak of a hole being inspiring, it is not intended that the visitor be subject to attacks of hysteria on every teeing ground.''
 Nevertheless, his fans have identified a number of features at Bethpage that seem to them quintessentially Tillinghast: the oval-shaped greens that often tilt from back to front, the upswept bunkers that flash right up to the greenside and the way the holes tend to be more easily approached from one side of the fairway than the other. 
 Young, the biographer, contends that the par-5 fourth hole, one of Bethpage's standouts, particularly displays the hand of the master, Tillinghast. ''If you stand on the fourth tee and look to the left,'' he said recently, ''you see a long natural valley where 90 percent of architects would have built the next hole. It was Tilly who saw that you could route the hole from one plateau to another plateau and have the green on a cliff edge. It became a memorable work of art.''
 No one denies that Bethpage is a great course in a league even with Pine Valley, whose landscape it somewhat resembles, and, like most golf courses, it has evolved and been modified over the years. Rees Jones gave the Black, then sadly overgrown, more than a makeover to ready it for the 2002 United States Open, the first time an Open had been played on a public course; he breathed new life into it and probably deserves equal billing. 
 Who originally designed the course hardly matters except on sentimental grounds, and here the Stratfordians have an edge, because unlike the self-effacing Burbeck, who if he did design Bethpage never claimed credit, Tillinghast was one of the most vivid and flamboyant characters in golf history. He was a sort of mad genius, who along with his friends Hugh Wilson, who designed Merion in Pennsylvania, and the obsessive George Crump, who built Pine Valley in southern New Jersey, belonged to that gilded generation of American course architects who were completely self-taught and yet built courses that have never been equaled. 
 Most surviving photos of Tillinghast show him with a walruslike soup-strainer of a mustache; in his heyday it was waxed and twirled to a point on each side. He was a rakish high-liver: a drinker, a gambler, a backer of failed Broadway musicals. He arrived at the golf course in a chauffeur-driven limousine and wearing a three-piece suit or even a tuxedo if he had been out too late the night before. He sometimes carried a flask with him, and laborers out on the course used to swear they could smell his ''exhaust.''
 Young said Tillinghast was probably bipolar. There were despondencies, pistol-waving rages and at least one suicide attempt. But when he wasn't disappearing on benders, he was a bundle of brilliance and entrepreneurial energy. When he was down on his luck, he built a miniature golf course and lighted driving range near his home in New Jersey. He also had a short-lived plan for an indoor miniature golf course on West 40th Street in New York that was really a front for a speakeasy. He was a pioneering golf photographer and an even better golf writer, who for years had a column in Golf Illustrated and also wrote two collections of golf fiction that in some ways anticipate P. G. Wodehouse.
 Until he was in his 30s, though, it didn't look as if Tillinghast would amount to much. Born in Philadelphia in 1875, he was the pampered, rebellious son of Benjamin Collins Tillinghast, who made a fortune in the rubber business. His company sold tires and also rubber suits for ministers who practiced full-immersion baptism. Tillinghast later bragged that he had never graduated from any of the many schools he attended because he either dropped out or was expelled. By the time he was in his late teens, he was a member of a wild, hard-drinking set of young Philadelphia rakes known as the Kelly Street gang, which might have been the model for the upper-class swells in the 1939 novel ''Kitty Foyle.''
 Golf saved him. He was introduced to the game by his father, and took it up seriously in 1895 during the first of several visits to Scotland, when he befriended Old Tom Morris, the legendary player and course builder. In 1906, a friend, Charles Worthington, asked Tillinghast, then 31 and perpetually unemployed, to build a course on some land he owned in Shawnee, Pa. Except for a little nine-holer he had laid out near his home, using canned-fruit tins for holes, he had no experience, and yet the new course was so successful that other commissions followed and he was soon greatly in demand. 
 In the late 1910s and the 1920s, he traveled all over, building and remodeling courses as far away as Texas and San Francisco, and leaving his mark at Baltusrol and Winged Foot and more than 60 other tournament-quality courses. During the Depression, though, the golf course business dried up. The Bethpage commission was both a godsend, even though the fee, $50 a day, was far less than he was accustomed to, and a last hurrah. In 1937, after declaring himself disgusted with the golf course business, Tillinghast moved to Beverly Hills, Calif., where he went into the antiques business, probably selling off his own furniture. He died, broke, in 1942.
 Joseph Burbeck died in 1987 but remained at Bethpage long enough to oversee the addition of a fifth course in 1958. The architect Alfred Tull was hired as a consultant, but Burbeck's son said his father drew all the plans himself.

HEADLINE: Providing Cellphones For the Poor

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
John Cobb, 59, a former commercial fisherman who is disabled with cirrhosis of the liver and emphysema, lives in a studio apartment in Greensboro, N.C., on a fixed monthly income of $674. He has been hoping to receive more government assistance, and in February, he did.
 It came in the form of a free cellphone and free service. 
 Mr. Cobb became one of a small but rapidly growing number of low-income Americans benefiting from a new wrinkle to a decades-old federal law that provided them with subsidized landline telephone service. 
 In a twist, wireless carriers are receiving subsidies to provide people like Mr. Cobb with a phone and typically 68 minutes of talk time each month. It is a form of wireless welfare that puts a societal stamp on the central role played by the mobile device.
 Mr. Cobb's cellphone is a Motorola 175. ''I feel so much safer when I drive. If I get sick, I can call someone. If I break down, I can call someone,'' Mr. Cobb said. ''It's a necessity.''
 The users are not the only ones receiving government assistance. Telecommunications industry analysts said the program, while in its infancy, could benefit mobile phone carriers, who face a steep challenge of their own: most Americans already own a cellphone, so the poor represent a last untapped market.
 ''The low hanging fruit is gone, and the wireless companies are going after the nooks and crannies,'' said Roger Entner, a wireless industry analyst with Nielsen. ''Oh, the poor: How can we sign them up?''
 Carriers can receive up to $10 a month in government subsidies, sufficient to cover what amounts to about $3 in service, Mr. Entner said.
 Since November, the number of customers receiving free or subsidized wireless service has doubled to 1.4 million, he said. To be eligible for the program, known as Lifeline, a person must meet federal low-income guidelines or qualify for one of a handful of social service programs, including food stamps or Medicaid.
 The opportunity has prompted interest from the nation's biggest carriers, including Sprint Nextel and AT&T. But at the forefront is a much smaller company, Tracfone, a Florida provider of prepaid mobile service that has become the face of the fledgling subsidized cellphone.
 Tracfone began providing its service, called SafeLink, in Tennessee in August and now does so in 16 states, including New York, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia, according to its Web site. Each time it enters a market -- which generally requires state approval -- it runs television ads telling people how easy it is to get a free Motorola phone, like Mr. Cobb's.
 The company says the economy makes the audience particularly receptive. ''We'll read that more people are signing up for food stamps and look at our numbers and see volume rising,'' said Jose Fuentes, director of government relations for Tracfone. ''It's not scientific proof,'' he added. ''But we know times are tough.''
 He declined to say how many subscribers have signed up. But he said Tracfone, whose paid service has 10 million subscribers, sees the Lifeline service as an opportunity to make some money but, more pointedly, to eventually convert the subsidized customers into paying ones if their fortunes turn around and they no longer qualify for a free phone.
 ''It could make for a good business,'' Mr. Fuentes said. 
 According to Nielsen, 90 percent of Americans have at least one cellphone. That leaves 32 million, including the infirm, still up for grabs. ''And the race is on to get them,'' Mr. Entner said. 
 He said the overwhelming majority of Americans with subsidized wireless service receive it through Tracfone. 
 One of them is Leon Simmons, 52, of the Bronx, N.Y., who did stints in the Navy, at the Post Office and as a security guard before becoming disabled with emphysema. His wife, who works a minimum wage job at a laundry, heard about the Tracfone service and he got a phone in April.
 The free phone is not, as it is for some others in the program, their sole form of telecommunications. Out of the roughly $1,600 they make each month after taxes, they pay $159 for a landline telephone, high-speed Internet and cable television. But the cellphone, Mr. Simmons says, gives him the flexibility to tell his wife or daughter his comings and goings or to stay in touch when he is at the doctor.
 According to the Federal Communications Commission, Lifeline service was started in 1984 to ensure that everyone had telephone service for emergencies. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 opened competition to new wireline and wireless providers. 
 More recently, companies, particularly Tracfone, have started pursuing the wireless opportunity. Still, most of the $800 million in subsidies last year went for landline service even as more Americans cut the cord in favor of exclusively using a mobile phone.
 The subsidy money comes from a tax applied to phone bills. Carriers seeking eligibility for it apply to state utility commissions, though several states have ceded their jurisdiction in the matter to the F.C.C.
 The issue has created controversy in some states over how and even whether to subsidize wireless service. In California, for example, the public utilities commission plans to debate on Thursday a proposal to extend Lifeline services to wireless -- a matter backed by companies like AT&T and Sprint and T-Mobile.
 The Greenlining Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group for low-income residents, has lobbied the state to ''move the California Lifeline program into the 21st century,'' according to public documents provided for the hearing on Thursday.
 But State Assemblyman Felipe Fuentes, who represents a district in Los Angeles, says the California legislature should ask some tough questions before moving ahead -- particularly if people contemplate making wireless their only form of communication. Chiefly, he wants to know whether wireless service satisfies crucial aspects needed in lifeline, like reliability in an emergency.
 ''What if the phone isn't charged, or junior doesn't know how to use it?'' Mr. Fuentes asked.
 Across the country, Mr. Simmons from the Bronx says he likes being able to communicate when he is on the go. And he does not see what all the fuss is about when it comes to cellphones. 
 ''People walk around with their head stuck into these things, not paying attention to what's going on around them,'' he said. Even though he thinks these people look silly, he said, he is going to use his cellphone.
 Why not? he said. ''It's free.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Births Hint At Bias for Sons In Some Asians

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
The trend is buried deep in United States census data: seemingly minute deviations in the proportion of boys and girls born to Americans of Chinese, Indian and Korean descent. 
 In those families, if the first child was a girl, it was more likely that a second child would be a boy, according to recent studies of census data. If the first two children were girls, it was even more likely that a third child would be male. 
 Demographers say the statistical deviation among Asian-American families is significant, and they believe it reflects not only a preference for male children, but a growing tendency for these families to embrace sex-selection techniques, like in vitro fertilization and sperm sorting, or abortion. 
 New immigrants typically transplant some of their customs and culture to the United States -- from tastes in food and child-rearing practices to their emphasis on education and the elevated social and economic status of males. The appeal to immigrants by clinics specializing in sex selection caused some controversy a decade ago. 
 But a number of experts expressed surprise to see evidence that the preference for sons among Asian-Americans has been so significantly carried over to this country. ''That this is going on in the United States -- people were blown away by this,'' said Prof. Lena Edlund of Columbia University. 
 She and her colleague Prof. Douglas Almond studied 2000 census data and published their results last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
 In general, more boys than girls are born in the United States, by a ratio of 1.05 to 1. But among American families of Chinese, Korean and Indian descent, the likelihood of having a boy increased to 1.17 to 1 if the first child was a girl, according to the Columbia economists. If the first two children were girls, the ratio for a third child was 1.51 to 1 -- or about 50 percent greater -- in favor of boys.
 Studies have not detected a similar preference for males among Japanese-Americans.
 The findings published by Professors Almond and Edlund were bolstered this year by the work of a University of Texas economist, Prof. Jason Abrevaya. He found that on the basis of census and birth records through 2004, the incidence of boys among immigrant Chinese parents in New York was higher than the national average for Chinese families. Boys typically account for about 515 of every 1,000 births. But he found that among Chinese New Yorkers having a third child, the number of boys was about 558.
 Joyce Moy, executive director of the Asian American/Asian Research Institute of the City University of New York, said that family values prevalent in China, including the tradition of elder parents depending on their sons for support, have seeped into American culture even among younger immigrants, and even when some of the historic underlying reasons for the preference are less relevant here than in China, Korea and India.
 ''Inheritance in the old country is carried through the male line,'' she said. ''Families depend on the male child for support.''
 Dr. Norbert Gleicher, medical director of the Center for Human Reproduction, a fertility and sex-selection clinic in New York and Chicago, said that from his experience, people were more inclined to want female children, except for Asians and Middle Easterners. 
 The preference for males among some immigrant Asians may fade with assimilation, experts said. And no one expects it to result in the lopsided male majorities like those in China, where, according to a study published this year in the British Medical Journal, the government's one-child policy has resulted in the world's highest sex disparity among newborns -- about 120 boys for every 100 girls.
 ''The patients come in and they all think they owe me an excuse, but the bottom line is it's cultural,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg, medical director of the Fertility Institutes, a California clinic that began sex-selection procedures in New York in March.
 The Fertility Institutes, which does not offer abortions, has unabashedly advertised its services in Indian- and Chinese-language newspapers in the United States.
 ''Culturally, there are a lot of strange things that go on in the world,'' Dr. Steinberg said. ''Whether we agree with it, it's not harming anyone.''
 Efforts by clinics to appeal to Indian families in the United States provoked criticism and some community introspection in 2001. Some newspapers and magazines that ran advertisements promoting the clinics, which offered sex-selection procedures, expressed regret at the perpetuation of what critics regard as a misogynistic practice. 
 In this country, some Asian families are having more than the two children they had planned for if the first two are girls. ''I do have girlfriends who have had multiple children in anticipation there will ultimately be a boy,'' Ms. Moy said. 
 Experts say that Asian-American families are using sex-selection techniques, also called family balancing.
 In China, sex selection is usually achieved by aborting female fetuses, which doctors say also occurs in this country, although few parents were willing to be interviewed about it.
 ''It's a real touchy thing,'' Dr. Steinberg said. ''It's illegal in Asia, and culturally, it's private.''
 One New York couple, Angie and Rick, Chinese immigrants who were brought here by their parents as young children and now own several food markets in the city, agreed to be interviewed only if their last name was not used.
 The first time Angie became pregnant and learned that the baby was a girl, she and her husband were merely disappointed. They had planned on having a second child anyway. When she learned she was pregnant with a girl again, though, the couple considered an abortion. 
 Their doctor argued against terminating the second pregnancy, they said. The couple reluctantly agreed to try for a third child. 
 ''Our theory was that to raise kids, it's tough already, so we didn't want too many,'' Rick recalled. 
 They explored various forms of sex selection, which could cost $15,000 or more, but they feared that because Angie was so fertile, the process would result in multiple births. She became pregnant a third time naturally. The couple were delighted to learn they were finally having a boy.
 ''If the third one was going to be a girl, then I would say probably I would have terminated,'' Angie said. 
 A 1989 study of sex selection in New York City, conducted by Dr. Masood Khatamee, a clinical professor at N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center, found that all the foreign-born couples -- mostly from Asia and the Middle East -- preferred boys, predominantly for cultural and economic reasons. Often, the pressure comes from the husband's parents. 
 ''I have two daughters and am married to an only child,'' said a Chinese-American professional woman who is married to an engineer. ''Early on, after the two girls were born and another two years went by and there was not a third, I found myself in the living room with four or five older relatives in a discussion of 'Wouldn't it be lovely for you to have a boy?' It's extremely uncomfortable.''
 Dr. Lisa Eng, a Hong Kong-born gynecologist who practices in Chinatown and Sunset Park, Brooklyn, said she tried to discourage couples who prefer boys from having abortions. 
 But, she said, ''If it's going to be a third, they're pretty determined to have a boy. If it's a boy, they keep it. If it's a girl, they'll abort.''

HEADLINE: A New Entry Stakes Out Low-Budget Film

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
A group of entertainment professionals has established a new motion picture company that will finance and distribute up to 12 low-budget movies a year.
 Many studios dedicated to independent movies have been closed (Picturehouse) or exist more in name than in function (Miramax). Production and advertising costs continue to climb, financing is virtually impossible to secure and the recession has severely reduced DVD revenue, once a safety net for specialized film. 
 DF Indie Studios, a venture to be based in New York and set to be introduced on Monday, will focus on films with budgets of up to $10 million, according to Mary E. Dickinson, chief executive of the venture, and Charlene Fisher, its president. 
 ''There's almost nobody left that focuses on this budget level,'' Ms. Fisher said.
 But Ms. Dickinson and Ms. Fisher -- the D and the F in DF Studios -- think independent productions are ripe for reinvention. ''There is going to be a dearth of quality product in the marketplace because financing has dried up for so many people, and that means we can move into that open spot,'' Ms. Dickinson said.
 The two would not discuss the company's financing and had no film projects to announce. They are still seeking investors.
 ''We are happily on the way with our financing, which will allow us to start making films in the fall,'' said Ms. Fisher, whose background is in entertainment business development and restructuring. Ms. Dickinson's experience includes reorganizing an extreme sports film company, Teton Gravity Research.
 Ms. Dickinson and Ms. Fisher have signed up an eclectic mix of entertainment industry personalities to advise them, including the Oscar-winning actress Tilda Swinton and Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment (and once Ms. Dickinson's agent). Ira Deutchman, a longtime film distribution expert and producer, and John Hadity, a former production executive at Miramax, are also assisting.
 Among the producers who have projects in development with the company are Jennifer Fox (''Michael Clayton'') and Ted Hope and Anne Carey (''The Ice Storm''). Scott Free, a production company owned by the directors Ridley and Tony Scott, and RedBone Films, co-founded by Samara Koffler, who formerly ran the actor Harrison Ford's production company, are also involved.
 The company's executive offices are stocked with experienced independent film people who unexpectedly found themselves looking for work. The chief financial officer, for instance, is Rita Chiappetta Thibault, formerly an executive vice president of finance and accounting for New Line, which was folded into Warner Brothers last year.
 DF Indie Studios says it will guarantee producers a theatrical release in the United States and ample advertising.
 ''We will have a fully fleshed-out marketing team that will start evaluating ideas -- figuring out how to sell them -- from greenlight,'' Ms. Dickinson said.

HEADLINE: Uninterested in History, Even the Turning Points

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 You report that the number of college courses in diplomatic, military, legal and economic history is shrinking, while the number of courses in social and cultural history is increasing (''Great Caesar's Ghost! Are Traditional History Courses Vanishing?,'' Arts pages, June 11). 
 All of these subjects are important. But there is reason to believe that the trend reflects a lack of interest in history itself, and not only at the college level. 
 During the 1980s, I taught United States history to American soldiers stationed in South Korea. In one fairly typical class, not one of the students had heard of the Battle of Gettysburg. Perhaps their high school teachers considered the subject a mere matter of military history. But most of the people who fought and died at Gettysburg were ordinary Americans, and our lives would be very different now if the ones wearing blue had stayed home.

HEADLINE: Two Rebirths, Miraculous But Unfinished

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: HUDSON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 All week long, the grand flotilla, led by a replica of Henry Hudson's Half Moon, has made its way up the river. It sailed under the Rip Van Winkle Bridge here Thursday afternoon, marking the anniversary of the ship's voyage 400 years ago. 
 Part history lesson, part spectacle, part celebration, Hudson 400 in many ways marks a fragile, incomplete miracle -- the way the river, a foul industrial cesspool just three decades ago, has been brought back to life. 
 But if the river, in large part, has been reclaimed, the future of the towns along it is a more complicated business. And few places reflect those complications more than Hudson, about 100 miles north of New York City. Once a raucous industrial city spewing pollutants into the river, then a boarded-up postindustrial corpse, now, like the river, it's both a marvel of reclamation and a problematic unfinished story.
 If you wanted a snapshot of the Hudson Valley reborn, you could have done worse than to have been in Hudson on Saturday when the Flag Day Parade rolled along the main drag, Warren Street, for almost two hours. On and on they came, from the Pearl Harbor survivor who was the parade marshal, to the Uncle Sam on stilts, the veterans, police officers, fire trucks and local politicians, to the Federation of Polish Sportsmen and the Squeeze Play Accordion Band.
 They rolled past Le Gamin Country Cafe and Boutique, past Bodhi Holistic Spa and Shoppe, past Baba Louie's wood-fired organic sourdough pizza, Omnia Nouveaux designer clothing, Pilates Hudson, a zillion art galleries and antiques stores. It was both vintage Americana and the new, hip Hudson Valley 2.0 exemplified by the art gallery and antiques store mavens who over the past two decades have brought this town back to life.
 The result: a slice of SoHo along the Hudson, with a new waterfront park that has a sense of vitality most small towns could only dream of. 
 But, as always, there's a catch. Most in the crowd -- men in their Harley-Davidson or Orange County Choppers T-shirts, kids in black do-rags, working families in old creaky vans -- don't have much connection to Hudson 2.0. It's fine, but it's not for them.
 And the Hudson that once supported them continues to wither away. Two of the remaining manufacturing employers, a furniture plant and one that made dehumidifiers, are closed or closing, costing hundreds of blue-collar jobs. The biggest debate of the past decade was over a proposal by a Canadian company, St. Lawrence Cement, to build a mammoth plant with a smokestack 40 stories high. The proposal had the town, which long ago had two cement plants on the river, divided between old and new. Its defeat was viewed as a significant environmental victory and a blessing for the downtown, but not necessarily for those for whom the fancy galleries are way out of reach.
 ''I put in countless job applications and no one even calls me back,'' said Jamont McClendon, 25, who says he's lucky to get part-time work. ''Everything's closing or being downsized. It's a great town in some ways, but I'm pretty disgusted. There's no living here unless you're rich.''
 FOR the most part, old and new get along in a town of 7,500, about a quarter black, that still feels like a real place, not a too-perfect, make-believe one.
 Dennis W. McEvoy runs J. C. Rogerson, a hardware store dating to 1832 that's the oldest on the street. He saw downtown prosper and then turn into a boarded-up ghost town when businesses fled to the malls, so he said Hudson was lucky to have the galleries and boutiques that have brought it back.
 ''The new businesses put us back on the map,'' he said. ''I hear people say, 'I wish we had the old stores,' but that's not going to happen.''
 Hudson's new economy, and that of much of the region, is inseparable from a reborn river. And even if it wasn't, surely we've learned enough to know that destroying our natural heritage can't ever be an option again.
 But in this lovely town, where new and old lingered after the parade to watch fireworks dance over the river, here's the dilemma. For decades we provided good blue-collar jobs by using the river as receptacle for every waste product and toxic substance factories spewed out.
 Those days are over. But for all the talk about green jobs, we're a long way from figuring out how to provide them in a world where we know that there's no difference between the river's health and our own.

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Do Hard Times 
 Affect Crime?
 We were apartment hunting in Fort Greene late last year and thought we'd struck gold on the first try: a two-bedroom in a corner brownstone, sunny, near the park, and the best part: a big -- by Brooklyn standards -- backyard. 
 But in the kitchen, I noticed a disproportionately large metal cage covering a window, with a heavy lock. Turns out, a burglar had broken in and stolen laptops and other valuables while the previous tenants were vacationing in Europe. The crime spooked them and they moved out. It spooked us, too, although we still wanted the place, which ultimately went to friends of the owner.
 It is tempting to blame the burglary on the economic downturn, but is it accurate? The tenants had left the windows ajar. Might it have been broken into a year earlier? The police would tend to say yes, that crime is flat or even dropping. Through June 7, killings were down 20 percent, to 170 from 213 at this time last year, and burglaries were down 13 percent.
 Still, an economic downturn tends to revive fears of high crime. Do you feel there is more crime, however minor, happening around you? Not all crime is violent. Has someone used the recession as an excuse to not fulfill a contractual obligation?

 TAKING
 QUESTIONS
 This week, John Cronin, director and chief executive officer of the Beacon Institute for Rivers and Estuaries and a senior fellow for environmental affairs at Pace University, will be answering readers' questions about General Electric's project to remove PCBs from the Hudson River.
 In 2000, Gov. George E. Pataki appointed him to help develop ''a global center for river and estuary research.'' The Beacon Institute was founded in 2004 on the shores of the Hudson River, with Mr. Cronin as interim chief. 
 As an advocate, lobbyist, legislative and Congressional aide, commercial fisherman, author and filmmaker, Mr. Cronin tackled a wide range of environmental issues, including Clean Water Act enforcement, disposal practices at Love Canal, fisheries management and the New York City Watershed Agreement. 
 Mr. Cronin is known internationally for his Hudson River work. He has served as Hudson Riverkeeper, inspiring a legacy of more than 160 waterkeeper programs on six continents. 
 The Beacon Institute has adopted technological innovation as a central mission. Its River and Estuary Observatory Network will monitor the Hudson through a network of sensors and robotics that provide real-time data. 
 During lectures, Mr. Cronin tells audiences: ''By harnessing the talent, intellect and passion that resides in every segment of society, we can harmonize forever the human and natural worlds. This is the greatest challenge of the 21st century.''

HEADLINE: Big Salvation Army Project Falls Short of Donor's Vision

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
At her death in 2003, Joan B. Kroc, the widow of the founder of the McDonald's Corporation, left a grand idea and $1.8 billion to make it happen. She wanted the Salvation Army to build some 30 lavish community centers around the nation, like the $87 million complex she paid for in San Diego, with three swimming pools, an indoor ice skating arena and a 600-seat theater.
 But more than five years later, her plan is sputtering.
 The gift has always rested uncomfortably with some Salvation Army officials, who have a hard time reconciling the elaborate centers with the Army's image as a frugal church that serves the needy. 
 Now, the plan is also proving difficult to finance. The Kroc fortune has been battered by the economic downturn, and raising additional money to make sure the centers can sustain themselves in the future has been challenging.
 So far, just four centers have been completed. Two are scheduled to open this year, and at least five more next year. Plans for two complexes, in Detroit and Massena, N.Y., have recently been scuttled. 
 ''The Salvation Army is not immune to the economic climate in which we find ourselves,'' said Lt. Col. Ken Johnson, the Salvation Army's secretary for business administration in the southern territory, one of four regional units. ''When Mrs. Kroc gave her gift, it was a different economic world.''
 Mrs. Kroc left enough money for each center to have an endowment equal to the cost of construction. It was a formula set by her financial advisers and was intended to cover any shortfall between a center's operating revenues and its overall budget. 
 The Army, though, believed that was not enough, so it required each community to raise additional money -- a total of $628 million nationally.
 To date, the Army has received pledges and commitments of 34 percent of that amount, or $214 million, a spokesman said.
 At the same time, Mrs. Kroc's gift has shrunk. The half reserved for endowments has declined by 14 percent, or about $126 million, to $774 million, according to the Army. 
 ''It's one thing to build,'' said Col. Steve Hedgren, chief secretary in the eastern territory, ''but we've got to have the assurance that everyone understands the importance of these endowments and partnerships in the communities to sustain these centers.''
 In some locales, deep-pocketed donors have stepped in to help. In Omaha, for example, a nonprofit fund-raising organization led by the community's most prominent business leaders pledged to raise the necessary $15 million, while in Grand Rapids, Mich., Amway and the two families who own it have been major contributors.
 But in other regions fund-raising has stalled. Long Beach, Calif., is struggling to raise $25 million. Chicago must raise $50 million.
 New York City will have to raise $200 million for the Kroc Center scheduled for Staten Island, in part because the community has expanded the project. 
 In Massena, the cancellation of the Kroc Center was prompted by the closure of a General Motors plant, as well as other signs of economic deterioration. 
 ''We'll be going back to communicate with donors that have given for Kroc to let them know that we're backing away from a Kroc center but will put up something else instead,'' Colonel Hedgren said. 
 In Detroit, Salvation Army officials decided to cancel plans for a $40 million Kroc Center, a move that has incited outrage there and raised questions about how they have handled Mrs. Kroc's gift. Army officials said they were simply unable to raise the needed money.
 Supporters of the center disagree. Lt. Col. Clarence Harvey, a retired Salvation Army fund-raiser who was hired part-time to help raise money for the Detroit Kroc Center, said there was a financing plan in place in 2007 that local Army officials sidelined.
 ''There wasn't any part of any program or future plan for Kroc that was not an example of the Salvation Army's mission, but it made some people uncomfortable,'' Colonel Harvey said. ''There was fear that the Army is incapable of running such a plant, fear that the aquatics programs would be problematic -- many concerns.'' 
 The plan proposed by Colonel Harvey and a fund-raiser who was not a Salvation Army member, Russ Russell, included using a loan to give the community more time to raise the $48 million the Army was requiring. 
 Additionally, a major donor had pledged to line up 18 other large donors to pay down most of the loan, with the remainder coming from a grass-roots fund-raising effort.
 But the plan was rejected by the leadership of the central territory. ''There was never any offer on the table and never any viable deal to pursue,'' said Col. Carol Seiler, the territory's coordinator for strategic mission planning. 
 She said the ''legal and practical'' obstacles were too high. 
 In the end, she said, only $2 million was raised for the Detroit center, and donors in Detroit were telling Army officials there that they preferred to support the Army's more traditional mission of serving basic needs. 
 Wayne Doran, a retired Ford Motor Company executive who led the Kroc fund-raising committee in Detroit, said he was confident the fund-raising goals could have been met and blamed internal Army squabbling for the cancellation of the center.
 ''I have great respect for the Salvation Army, but this couldn't survive the political bickering that was going on among Army members,'' Mr. Doran said. ''People who give a lot of money do not want to give into a situation that is fraught with those kinds of problems.''
 The Army recently turned down an offer of $250,000 from the Detroit Black McDonald's Owners to support fund-raising and now plans to put a much smaller non-Kroc facility on the site. Community groups and others involved in the project have signed up more than 150 people to protest at the Salvation Army's central territory headquarters in Chicago this month.
 Meanwhile, other Kroc Centers are progressing. The Salem, Ore., center is scheduled to open in September, and the Omaha center in November; and at least five others are expected to open next year. 
 In some places, the Salvation Army has shown greater flexibility toward fund-raising goals. The central territory, for example, has allowed fund-raisers in Chicago to split their campaign into three phases.
 Similarly, fund-raisers for the Kroc Center in Philadelphia say they believe that starting construction will help spur donations, so a 12-acre site there has been cleared and the holes have been dug for the pools. 
 ''Some folks are less capable of giving because of investment returns and asset values being less, but they still want to hear from us,'' said Raymond Welsh, a senior vice president at UBS Financial Services and chairman of the Philadelphia fund-raising committee. ''Some are saying not now, but that's not no forever.''

HEADLINE: The Rights of Domestic Workers

 BODY:
There are more than 200,000 workplaces in New York State where fundamental labor standards do not apply, not even in theory. These are not sweatshops or salt mines. They are private homes, where housekeepers, nannies and caregivers for the elderly do work as important as it is isolated and unprotected. 
 The exclusion is a relic of the New Deal, when labor protections like overtime pay were written specifically to exclude domestic and farm labor. From exclusion it can be a short distance to abuse: to long hours, low pay, dehumanizing treatment, physical and sexual harassment.
Domestic workers and their advocates in New York have been pressing for reforms. They have been telling their stories in Albany and across the state and steadily gathering support for a Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights. The legislation, the first of its kind in the nation, would reform state labor law to provide basic protections like time-and-a-half pay for every hour over a 40-hour week; one day off a week; paid vacation and sick days; severance pay and health coverage -- and a means of enforcing these standards in court. 
 Most other workers take these standards for granted. They don't know what it's like to have to show up for work sick rather than be fired, to be denied privacy and dignity, to be powerless to demand decent treatment from their employers. 
 Backers of the bill had been confident that this could finally be the year for a groundbreaking victory, at least before the recent power struggle brought the Capitol to new depths of shame, ridicule and paralysis.
 If the Legislature decides to return to its senses and start passing meaningful legislation that improves New Yorkers' lives, it should include the Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights. Albany, which has not been able to govern its way out of a paper bag, should at least be able to bestow some fundamental rights and protections on the invisible workers whose labors are a cornerstone of the New York economy.

HEADLINE: A World of Risk for a New Brand of Journalist

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
As the journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee complete their third month of detainment in North Korea, it remains rather astonishing that they were there in the first place to report for a fledgling cable channel. But their path there may explain in part why they remain in custody.
 They were working not for a news network or a widely read newspaper, but for Current TV, a channel best known, if it is known at all, for a mix of short YouTube-style segments about technology, current events and culture. The two journalists, both American, were reportedly working on a piece about North Korean refugees when they were stopped by border guards. Last week, the women were sentenced to 12 years in a labor prison, prompting diplomatic maneuverings to gain their release.
 Start-up news organizations like Current TV are increasingly sending journalists to the world's hot spots, putting a spotlight on news stories in new ways. It is, experts say, another consequence of the fragmented media landscape and the declines in international news coverage by traditional outlets. 
 The unconventional assignments are an expression of the generational changes in news coverage, especially in TV, where the jobs of camera operators, sound technicians and producers have, in many cases, been subsumed into one do-it-all position. And being unencumbered by a traditional news outlet has its advantages, as the reporters are sometimes free to take more risks.
 ''There's an impetus with any upstart news organization that you have to be bolder and you have to be more aggressive than other news organizations to get attention for your stories,'' said Kevin Sites, a freelance journalist who covered conflicts for Yahoo. ''That has to be admired. That also has a real inherent risk in it.''
 One of the risks of this kind of improvised, headlong journalism is that reporters lack the backing of large established news organizations that might have the experience and leverage to deal with foreign governments. While Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee, full-time employees of Current, have the backing of Al Gore, who is a founder of the network, they lack the support system that their colleagues at CNN and the British Broadcasting Corporation enjoy. 
 Current TV purposefully has kept quiet about Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee, steadfastly declining to comment on their status. Initial news reports about the detainments were swiftly removed from the channel's Web site in April. The two women's profiles were scrubbed of any reference to the detainments. 
 When journalists are detained or otherwise endangered overseas, news organizations often decide not to comment as they work aggressively behind the scenes for the release of their employees. Joel Hyatt, the chief executive of Current, appeared in a jacket with the network's logo at a vigil for them in San Francisco this month. ''Current will continue to tell the important stories affecting our world that no one else is telling,'' Mr. Hyatt said by e-mail on Sunday. 
 The families of Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee have not criticized the network directly, but they did grant a series of interviews in early June after keeping quiet for months.
 ''Our families have been very quiet because of the extreme sensitivity of the situation, but given the fact that our girls are in the midst of a global nuclear standoff, we cannot wait any longer,'' Ms. Ling's older sister, Lisa, also a journalist, told supporters in a message to a Facebook group. She said the women ''just wanted to tell the world a story.''
 Current, which caters to an 18- to 34-year-old audience and has posted generally low ratings in its four years, tried to fill what it identified as a void in mainstream news coverage with the creation of ''vanguard journalism,'' a unit assembled to cover ''untold stories around the globe,'' as the network put it. 
 Ms. Ling is the vice president of the unit, which has received a number of coveted awards, including the duPont for a 2007 investigation of neo-Nazi violence in Russia. Ms. Lee is an editor with about a decade of film and TV experience. The trip in March to North Korea was her first overseas assignment.
 They traveled together with a cameraman and a Chinese guide, but they were working without the broad safety net that a traditional news organization can provide. The cameraman, Mitch Koss, is an experienced journalist who has returned to the United States. He was reportedly questioned by Chinese authorities, and he was unavailable for comment last week. 
 At a big news outlet or a wire service, ''they have resources that they can call upon to come to the aid'' of journalists, said Robert Mahoney, the deputy director of the Committee to Protect Journalists.
 For example, he said, ''they have access to the airwaves that is not to be underestimated.'' When Alan Johnston, a reporter for the BBC, was kidnapped in Gaza in 2007, the network held rallies, organized petitions, arranged for a simulcast on competing networks, and placed advertisements in newspapers to put pressure on his captors and call for his release. He was released after nearly four months in custody. 
 Major outlets are also able to call on their existing diplomatic and military contacts for help.
 ''All that is fairly easy when you have a big organization standing behind you,'' Mr. Mahoney said. ''You have a huge treasure of resources behind you.''
 Conversely, smaller outlets may not have as much support. The Committee to Protect Journalists found that in 2008, at least 56 of the 125 jailed journalists worked for online outlets and that 45 of the total were freelancers. 
 ''These freelancers are not employees of media companies and often do not have the legal resources or political connections that might help them gain their freedom,'' the committee reported. 
 As news divisions hit by the recession make cuts in foreign coverage, freelancers shoulder more of the risks. ''Pretty soon we're just not going to have any of the types of stories Laura and Euna went to cover,'' said Daniel Beckmann, a friend of Ms. Ling and a former colleague at Current TV. 
 As journalism moves to the Web, new foreign news models and sources are emerging. The music magazine Vice and its video site VBS.tv produced videos from Iraq in 2006. This year, an ambitious new Web site called GlobalPost began, relying on freelancers in dozens of countries. And over the weekend, online sources like TehranBureau.com, which combines reporting from Iran with observations from outsiders and accepts donations, had surges of traffic as users sought information about the protests in that country.
 News distributors are known to come to the aid of freelancers, as they did this year when Roxana Saberi was charged with espionage in Iran. The BBC, ABC, Fox News and National Public Radio released a joint statement and worked behind the scenes to secure her release. She was freed last month. Through a spokeswoman, she declined to comment, but she has said in interviews that she wants Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee to know that ''you are not alone.''

HEADLINE: Cracks in Muzak Monolith as a Young Rival Grows

BYLINE: By TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
When Muzak, the company whose name has become synonymous with syrupy instrumental renditions of pop songs piped into elevators, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February, Joshua Katz's phone started ringing. 
 ''I must've gotten 25 calls,'' said Mr. Katz, the co-owner of El Records, a six-person company that provides custom music for luxury hotels and other high-end brands. ''People started addressing what they were paying for and realized they weren't happy,'' he said of the bevy of potential customers looking to flee the monolithic music provider. 
 Muzak may soothe the savage elevator-riding breast, but can it soothe nervous shoppers? It has been a decade since the company, based in Fort Mill, S.C., underwent a major brand overhaul veering away from elevator music to provide businesses with tailored playlists, including the not-so-syrupy original versions of pop songs, as background music. They have also expanded their product offerings to include digital signs, audio installation, commercial television, and on-hold and in-store messages. 
 But Muzak's expanded repertoire did not save it from joining the ranks of troubled music providers like Sirius XM Radio and Clear Channel Communications. 
 Bob Finigan, Muzak's vice president for product and marketing, insists the bankruptcy filing was ''independent of the current economic crisis,'' and instead the result of debt incurred a decade ago when Muzak made a series of acquisitions, but he declined to specify what those acquisitions were. 
 And there is another issue for Muzak to fight: perception. 
 ''If you ever have a teacher or a parent who tries to use that cool phrase, that's Muzak,'' said Maggie Houston, a manager at the boutique Duane Street Hotel in New York, one of Muzak's clients. The company turned 75 this year, but Mr. Finigan insists age is only a number. ''It's not your grandfather's Muzak,'' he said. 
 Ms. Houston disagrees. She said she was unhappy with the type of songs and lack of variety in the selection provided by Muzak. ''Everyone here can sing the songs by heart,'' she said. She has also fielded complaints from hotel guests who she said have asked her to turn the music down. ''In the morning people are just waking up,'' she said. ''they don't want to hear club music.'' 
 The hotel is considering using other music services but plans to keep Muzak for its on-hold message service. 
 The perception of Muzak as stodgy and out of touch is a boon to El Records, which is five years old. ''They may have a database, but they don't know how to use it,'' said Mr. Katz, who attributes his growing client list to an increased sophistication in music taste among clients. 
 ''People want to hear more than what's on the Top 100 chart.'' To that end, El Records uses a mix of licensed music from pop artists and their own D.J.'s and producers. 
 While Mr. Katz recognizes that his company and Muzak are ''not in the same ballgame'' in terms of size and reach, that is not stopping him from trying to position El Records as the ''new version of them.'' 
 In Manhattan's fashionable meatpacking district, Elon Kenchington, chief operating officer of the Gansevoort Hotel Group, has settled on what he calls ''a winning combination'' of Muzak and music from El Records. 
 Mr. Kenchington, who uses Muzak at properties in New York and Miami, said the service was integral to building the brand by creating different moods for the hotel's many spaces, including its lobby and rooftop decks. 
 Another reason is legal. ''You hear all of these nightmares about other companies using their own music,'' said Mr. Kenchington about the dangers of using unlicensed music. ''Muzak protects us from all of that.'' 
 But if the hotel needs a quick turnaround for a branded CD or is hosting a party that requires a specific mood, Mr. Kenchington calls Mr. Katz. ''They just get it,'' said Mr. Kenchington, adding that he can visit El Record's Midtown studio himself and make a more creative contribution. 
 El Records may by vying for Muzak's business -- and Mr. Katz says the company is close to sealing deals with some of its former clients -- but Muzak is still a dominant player. Its Web site lists clients like Applebee's and Aveda. Because of the recession, Mr. Finigan said, the company is feeling the pinch of slow growth in the opening of stores nationwide. But he said business at fast-food restaurants like McDonald's has been booming. 
 ''I'd like to think that brands understand the world is more competitive than it ever has been,'' Mr. Finigan said. Muzak is telling its clients to ''turn the volume up,'' he said, in the hope that they can profit from helping customers achieve the ''intangible aspect of feeling good in a down economy.''

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Five Ways to Fix America's Schools'' (Op-Ed, June 8): 
 Using high-pressure sales tactics to encourage students not to skip classes or drop out, as Harold O. Levy proposes, will be useless unless parents become more engaged with their children and the curriculum becomes relevant to the 21st century. The schools, and also social services, need to become involved in exactly why students are not attending.
 Similarly, mandating that students stay in school until they are 19 will be a boon only to the education industry. It would be better, and more economical, to improve the curriculum and reduce the amount of summer vacation rather mandating an extra school year.
 Finally, Mr. Levy should also consider whether in fact too many students are going to post-secondary institutions already. Pushing more students into post-secondary education through advertising removes the entire issue of whether colleges are preparing students for the workplace.

HEADLINE: At the Shore, Trying to Add 'Corndog Fryer' to a Long Resume

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: POINT PLEASANT, N.J. 

 BODY:
As the unemployment rate climbed this spring, thousands of recently laid-off workers descended upon the resort communities along the Jersey Shore looking for summer work, hoping for an infusion of cash and a brief respite from job hunting. 
 But for many of the applicants who are older and have extensive resumes, finding work along the boardwalk can be as elusive as winning one of those deceptively easy-looking ring toss games. 
 The annual job fair here for Jenkinson's Pier in March attracted more than 1,000 people in the first hour, as many applicants as it had in all of last summer, said Marilou Halvorsen, a company spokeswoman. 
 In Cape May, business owners have seen ''the kind of resumes and applicants with the kinds of experience they rarely see in good times,'' said Vicki Clark, president of the county chamber of commerce. 
 At the Shrimp Box restaurant in Point Pleasant Beach, so many people come in looking for work that the bartenders often joke about serving more job seekers than customers. 
 ''Computer programmers, people from casinos, factory workers, salesmen, everything,'' said Nick Gyftakis, the owner. ''I've been in business more than 30 years, and we've never seen things like this before.''
 Employers said the surge in applications was a drastic shift from recent years, when public pools and beaches in New Jersey occasionally had to close because there were not enough people willing to work as lifeguards. 
 But the same recession that has eliminated year-round jobs, thereby increasing the pool of available seasonal workers, has made employers at seasonal businesses reduce hiring by 10 to 20 percent compared with last year.
 As for the jobs that are being filled, many business owners say they would rather hire students on summer break than their newly unemployed parents, because, they say, many older workers consider themselves overqualified to fry corndogs at $7.25 an hour and are liable to quit midsummer if a year-round job arises.
 So while the number, and demographics, of the job applicants has changed because of the economic downturn, the work force staffing the arcades and beachfront bars this summer -- as in summers past -- will be overwhelmingly made up of high school and college students from the United States and abroad. 
 ''It's hard enough to bring yourself to actually apply for a job that pays, what, not even half of what you're used to making,'' said Laura Rozamus, 58, who looked for work along the boardwalk in Absecon after losing her job in customer service for Blue Cross. ''But to be turned down, again and again, just makes you sad -- and frustrated.''
 It was not supposed to turn out this way. 
 After the economy faltered last fall, the State Department braced for a deluge of the newly unemployed to flock to resort communities, asking the companies that bring overseas students to the United States for the summer to reduce the number of seasonal workers by 20 percent. Andrew Laine, a State Department spokesman, said it is too early to tell whether the number of overseas workers will approach the 151,000 who came last summer, but employment companies say there are far fewer students here on summer visas.
 That drop in foreign workers has been exceeded by a surge in applications from local residents who are out of work. 
 But with the recession raising concerns about a possible drop in tourist spending, many businesses are being cautious about hiring. The New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development reports that the total number of jobs in the leisure and hospitality field -- which includes restaurants, hotels and recreational facilities -- dropped to 334,000 in April 2009 from 345,000 in April 2008, and business owners say they are still not certain what to expect this summer.
 ''There are all these people trying to support their families, and you want to help them all, but you can't,'' said Marilyn Schlossbach, who owns three restaurants in Asbury Park. 
 ''It takes a lot of expertise to run an insurance office or be a financial adviser,'' she said, ''but those skills won't necessarily help when it's a busy night and there are eight tables backed up. And I can't afford to train people once the season gets going.'' 
 Jenkinson's Pier hired about 1,700 summer workers to run its amusement park, boardwalk booths, aquarium, souvenir shops, restaurants and bars, but only one was an adult who had recently been recently laid off from a year-round job. Wonderland Pier in Ocean City hired 200 people as ride operators for the summer, including 10 recently unemployed. Those employees are expected to begin later this month, but there is no guarantee that the older workers will actually show up, according to John Cavachuk, who handles hiring for the company. 
 ''One guy in his 40s started working last month, but he already quit because he got a better job doing what he wanted to do -- being a mechanic,'' Mr. Cavachuk said.
 Ms. Schlossbach, the restaurant owner, did hire two older workers who recently lost their jobs. One of them, Kim Crawford, 42, moved back to New Jersey in February after more than a decade in San Francisco to take a new job as an account executive for a food wholesaler. Thirty-three days after she began her new job, Ms. Crawford said, she was laid off. 
 ''After convincing me to move back here and promising that my position was secure, they told me that the New York economy was worse than they had anticipated,'' said Ms. Crawford, who now waits tables at the Langosta Lounge along the beach in Asbury Park. ''I thought I was at a point in my life where I was beyond waitressing. But I'm lucky to have steady work and good money to get me through the summer. And in the fall I can look for a real job.''
 Others have not been nearly as fortunate. Barry Kramer of Toms River, a machinist, was laid off in February and spent weeks filling out applications for work in Ocean City. ''The people doing the hiring say everything's already taken,'' he said. Mr. Kramer, 47, said he suspected that many employers in resort communities would rather hire younger workers to project a more youthful image.
 Ms. Rozamus came to the Jersey Shore from Albany with her companion, figuring that between the casinos and annual influx of tourists, they would be able to find steady work and enjoy a summer on the beach. But the casinos have laid off workers, and Ms. Rozamus said the restaurants and attractions near the beach had no work for either of them. The couple is now living in a motel; she took a job as a housekeeper at a nearby inn and he has found a few days' work through a temp agency. 
 ''It's a lot worse than we expected, but in Albany, there's just no job prospects at all,'' she said. ''If we can't find something better here soon, we're going to try another resort area. It's a long summer, so if we keep looking, something will happen, eventually.''

CORRECTION-DATE: June 18, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the search for summer jobs along the Jersey Shore misidentified the location of Jenkinson's Pier, an entertainment complex on the boardwalk. It is in Point Pleasant Beach -- not Point Pleasant, as the dateline indicated. Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the location of the boardwalk where Laura Rozamus, a former Blue Cross employee, said she had been seeking work after arriving from Albany. It is in Atlantic City; there is no boardwalk in Absecon.

HEADLINE: Fair for Orthodox Jews Offers Jelly Beans, Jobs and New Towns

BYLINE: By ANN FARMER

 BODY:
At one table there were kosher jelly beans and lists of jobs. At another there were Tabasco sauce and real estate deals touted as even hotter than the sauce.
 The idea, at the jobs and relocation fair on the West Side of Manhattan, was to lure Orthodox Jews from New York City to towns and other cities where emerging Orthodox communities are eager to reinforce their numbers.
''They're all over the country,'' said Frank Buchweitz, the national director of community services and special projects for the Orthodox Union, a Jewish outreach and social service organization that sponsored the fair. ''We want to help them grow.'' 
 At another table, Alan Katz, a lawyer from New Orleans, said that his synagogue was destroyed during Hurricane Katrina and that the city lost some of its Orthodox community afterward. ''We'd like to get some people to help us raise the new synagogue,'' he said. ''We're focusing on jobs and affordable housing.'' 
 Scott Friedman, 38, a Realtor from Denver, handed a real estate brochure to a couple. ''These are pretty centrally located,'' he said, pointing to several four- and five-bedroom homes. ''There are shuls close by.''
 ''For us, it's about expanding the critical mass of the Orthodox community in Denver,'' he said. ''We're trying to get to the next level.'' 
 Jacob Sassoon, 25, a financial analyst from Washington Heights who was laid off a few months ago and got married three weeks ago, said he and his wife were considering a move to any location that could guarantee him work. ''Wherever I can find a job, that's where we'll move,'' he said as his wife, Kara, 28, a social worker, nodded beside him. 
 Avi Burstein, 25, a mental-health therapist who lives in Riverdale, in the Bronx, said: ''We're looking to get out of New York. I've been here for 25 years, and I need to slow down a little.'' He and his wife, Adena, 26, an occupational therapist, see Denver as a possibility, but not Des Moines.
 ''I like the mountains, but no plains,'' he said. ''When we're looking, we're looking for something that already has a start-up community. We don't want to be pioneers.''
 But Janice Schwarzbaum, 50, a representative of the Orthodox community in Des Moines, whose family of nine moved there from Miami in 2003, pitched the benefits of Iowa with three simple sentences. ''It's affordable. It's beautiful. It's clean,'' she said.
 ''When we got there,'' said her daughter Chanee Schwarzbaum, 23, ''we heard on the news that there was a 45-second delay on the highway.'' She added, ''There's not much crime at all.''
 At the Orthodox Union's first fair, last year, 14 communities emphasized their ways of life and the moderate prices of their homes. This year, with heightened concern over the economy, 22 communities, from as far away as San Francisco and as close as Stony Brook on Long Island, set up tables, slide shows and PowerPoint displays that emphasized jobs. 
 ''In our community, we have one of everything,'' said Amy Brooke, a registered nurse from Norfolk, Va., touting the community's Orthodox synagogue, mikvah, day school, boys' high school, girls' high school and kosher market. ''And we brought jobs with us,'' she added, referring to a stack of listings. 
 ''We're not looking for a hundred families,'' she said. ''We're looking for 10. Ten would be a dream come true.'' 
 A slide show of life in Allentown, Pa., showed rock climbers and a man tossing a ball with his son, along with images of a kosher food store and a Jewish day school. Abby Wiener, 61, who was promoting Allentown, said that when she first arrived there from Teaneck, N.J., and strangers would say hello, ''I got scared.''
 She added that she went to a two-minute commute from a 50-minute one. ''We feel people in New York have to come out and see what opportunities exist outside,'' she said ''We need more people.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 17, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Monday about a job and relocation fair at which Orthodox Jews in New York were encouraged to move to emerging Orthodox communities elsewhere in the country misidentified the former hometown of Abby Wiener, who was touting her new place of residence, Allentown, Pa. She formerly lived in Monsey, N.Y., not Teaneck, N.J. The article also misattributed a comment about a shorter commute to work. It was Ms. Wiener's son Nate -- not Ms. Wiener herself -- who said that his commute went from 50 minutes to 2 after his move (to Allentown from Teaneck).

IPhones Likely
 To Remain Costly
 Debbie Galant, who runs a blog about my hometown, Montclair, N.J., sent me a message asking me to join a Facebook group protesting the pricing for iPhone owners who want to upgrade to the new model. 
 Ms. Galant feels sucker-punched by Apple, which sent her an e-mail luring her with the video capabilities of the new phone and a price of $199. She took the bait, only to see the price jump to $399 because she hadn't finished her two-year contract.
 But the policies that Apple has worked out with AT&T may actually be far more consumer-friendly than average for the cellphone industry. In today's world, you don't so much buy technology products as subscribe to them, and Apple's iPhone pricing makes that especially clear. 
 When it first entered the cellphone business, Apple sold phones to the public at $399 to $599, without a carrier subsidy. That allowed the data plan to be sold to consumers for $20 a month instead of $30 a month. Apple got a share of the monthly fee, plus the purchase price (less a cut for AT&T if it sold the phone). That structure would allow people to buy new phones whenever they wanted.
 This model proved unworkable internationally, and consumers responded better to a lower upfront cost and higher monthly fees. So now the $199 phone is in effect sold to AT&T for what analysts estimate to be $550, including a $350 subsidy that AT&T will make up on service fees over the course of the contract. If Apple or another retailer sells the phone, AT&T pays bounties that bring the economics in line with this model. Apple no longer gets any of the monthly fees.
 Apple's totalitarian simplicity, and the regularity of its behavior so far, creates the expectation of choices:
 The $199-every-two-years plan. That gives you the base model of the latest phone hardware every two years. There is a similar $299-every-two-years plan for the higher-capacity phone.
 The $399-every-year plan (with an introductory rate of $199 the first year only). For four times the effective annual cost, you get the base model as soon as it comes out. Premium users may gravitate to the $499-a-year plan ($299 to start out) just to have the very best model.
 The new $99-every-two-years plan, if you want to have last year's model and keep it for two years. SAUL HANSELL

HEADLINE: Issue of Property Rights Is Likely to Arise in Sotomayor's Confirmation Hearings

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Supreme Court nominees almost never comment on recent decisions from the court they hope to join. But both Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. broke with protocol and perhaps prudence at their confirmation hearings when it came to a decision that had been issued just months before, Kelo v. City of New London.
 Without quite saying Kelo had been incorrectly decided, both men, at the time federal appeals court judges, spoke at length about their doubts concerning its wisdom and consequences. The decision, a 5-to-4 ruling in 2005, allowed local governments to take private property for business development and provoked outrage across the political spectrum.
 Judge Sonia Sotomayor will doubtless be questioned about Kelo at her confirmation hearings next month. But her answers will be complicated by her participation in a 2006 decision applying and extending Kelo. 
 Bart Didden, the property owner on the losing side of that decision, Didden v. Village of Port Chester, said in an interview that he had been contacted by aides to Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee who seemed eager to explore Judge Sotomayor's views on property rights. 
 The ruling in Didden is not popular among some property rights and constitutional law professors. Eight of them filed a brief in 2006 unsuccessfully urging the Supreme Court to hear an appeal. 
 ''This is the worst federal court takings decision since Kelo,'' said Ilya Somin, who teaches property law at George Mason University and helped write the brief. ''It's very extreme, and it is significant as a window into Judge Sotomayor's attitudes toward private property.''
 But another author of the brief, Richard A. Epstein, said the decision in Mr. Didden's case was a rare misfire that provided no larger insights into Judge Sotomayor's thinking.
 ''It's a disappointment and it's wrong and it's ill thought out,'' Professor Epstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago and New York University, said of the ruling. ''But it's not one of six. It's one of two.'' (The other poorly handled decision, he said, was Ricci v. DeStefano, which rejected employment discrimination claims from white firefighters in New Haven.)
 The case arose from a meeting in 2003 between Mr. Didden, who owned property in Port Chester, N.Y., and an executive of a company that had been designated by the village to develop a 27-acre urban renewal area that included part of the property. What happened at that meeting, Mr. Didden said, amounted to extortion. 
 Mr. Didden had made arrangements to put a CVS drug store on his lot. At the meeting, the executive, Gregg Wasser, demanded $800,000 as the price for permission to proceed with that project, Mr. Didden said in court papers. The alternative, Mr. Wasser said, according to the papers, was to have the village condemn Mr. Didden's property so that Mr. Wasser's company could put a Walgreen's in the same place. 
 ''Here is a private person standing in the shoes of the government with the power to condemn or not condemn,'' Mr. Didden said. ''The $800,000 wasn't going to rehabilitate a public park or build a soccer stadium. It was going into his pocket.''
 Mr. Didden refused. The next day the village condemned his property.
 Mr. Wasser did not respond to a recent message seeking comment left with an assistant. In a sworn statement in 2004, he denied being ''part of an 'extortion' plot'' and said the accusation was ''beyond my comprehension.'' The meeting, he said, was a settlement negotiation concerning competing claims to the same property. ''An $800,000 figure,'' he said, ''was an appropriate buyout.''
 Mr. Didden and a business partner sued, and a federal judge dismissed their case in 2004. When the case reached Judge Sotomayor's court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Mr. Didden said he had reason to be hopeful. 
 ''She was highly engaged,'' Mr. Didden said of Judge Sotomayor's questioning at the argument in 2005. The other members of the panel were Judges Reena Raggi and Peter W. Hall. 
 ''We felt like we got our day in court,'' Mr. Didden said. ''We felt that she got the point.''
 But then more than a year passed. In the end, the decision was terse and unsigned, and it rejected Mr. Didden's claims.
 ''It took 54 weeks to issue those four paragraphs,'' Mr. Didden said. According to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the median interval between argument and decision in the Second Circuit, both then and now, is less than a month.
 The brief decision in Didden made two points. First, it said Mr. Didden had filed his suit too late. The village had announced the redevelopment plan in 1999, and Mr. Didden did not sue until 2004. His claim, the court said, was therefore barred by a three-year statute of limitations.
 That was a curious ruling, Professor Epstein said, because it required Mr. Didden to sue over his claim of extortion before it happened. 
 The court also rejected Mr. Didden's claim that Port Chester should not be allowed to take his property so that another company could build a different drug store. The takings clause of the Fifth Amendment -- ''nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation'' -- should not apply, he had argued, to such transfers. 
 Judge Roberts, at his confirmation hearings in 2005, seemed sympathetic to that kind of argument. The takings clause is uncontroversial when it is used to take property for public purposes like roads and schools. But it is a ''basic proposition,'' Judge Roberts added, that ''government can't take property from A and give it to B.'' 
 No one disputes that Mr. Didden and his partner are entitled to be compensated for his property. Mr. Didden said the final amount had not been determined.
 But Judges Roberts and Alito, at their confirmation hearings, said larger issues are involved in government takings.
 ''It touches some very sensitive nerves,'' Judge Alito said. ''Taking their home away and giving them money in return, even if they get fair market value for the home, is still an enormous loss for people.'' 
 Judge Roberts, who said he had been surprised by the Kelo decision, said he welcomed new state laws ''saying we do not authorize the use of the power of eminent domain to take for a use that's going to be from one private owner to another.'' Such laws, he said, are ''certainly an appropriate reaction to a court's decision in this area.'' 
 He added that the author of the majority opinion in Kelo, Justice John Paul Stevens, had said at a bar association meeting that he would have voted against the takings plan had he been a legislator rather than a judge making a constitutional determination. ''The free play of market forces is more likely to produce acceptable results in the long run than the best-intentioned plans of public officials,'' Justice Stevens said in the speech.

HEADLINE: Stay the Course

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The debate over economic policy has taken a predictable yet ominous turn: the crisis seems to be easing, and a chorus of critics is already demanding that the Federal Reserve and the Obama administration abandon their rescue efforts. For those who know their history, it's deja vu all over again -- literally.
 For this is the third time in history that a major economy has found itself in a liquidity trap, a situation in which interest-rate cuts, the conventional way to perk up the economy, have reached their limit. When this happens, unconventional measures are the only way to fight recession. 
 Yet such unconventional measures make the conventionally minded uncomfortable, and they keep pushing for a return to normalcy. In previous liquidity-trap episodes, policy makers gave in to these pressures far too soon, plunging the economy back into crisis. And if the critics have their way, we'll do the same thing this time. 
 The first example of policy in a liquidity trap comes from the 1930s. The U.S. economy grew rapidly from 1933 to 1937, helped along by New Deal policies. America, however, remained well short of full employment. 
 Yet policy makers stopped worrying about depression and started worrying about inflation. The Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy, while F.D.R. tried to balance the federal budget. Sure enough, the economy slumped again, and full recovery had to wait for World War II.
 The second example is Japan in the 1990s. After slumping early in the decade, Japan experienced a partial recovery, with the economy growing almost 3 percent in 1996. Policy makers responded by shifting their focus to the budget deficit, raising taxes and cutting spending. Japan proceeded to slide back into recession. 
 And here we go again. 
 On one side, the inflation worriers are harassing the Fed. The latest example: Arthur Laffer, he of the curve, warns that the Fed's policies will cause devastating inflation. He recommends, among other things, possibly raising banks' reserve requirements, which happens to be exactly what the Fed did in 1936 and 1937 -- a move that none other than Milton Friedman condemned as helping to strangle economic recovery.
 Meanwhile, there are demands from several directions that President Obama's fiscal stimulus plan be canceled. 
 Some, especially in Europe, argue that stimulus isn't needed, because the economy is already turning around.
 Others claim that government borrowing is driving up interest rates, and that this will derail recovery.
 And Republicans, providing a bit of comic relief, are saying that the stimulus has failed, because the enabling legislation was passed four months ago -- wow, four whole months! -- yet unemployment is still rising. This suggests an interesting comparison with the economic record of Ronald Reagan, whose 1981 tax cut was followed by no less than 16 months of rising unemployment.
 O.K., time for some reality checks.
 First of all, while stock markets have been celebrating the economy's ''green shoots,'' the fact is that unemployment is very high and still rising. That is, we're not even experiencing the kind of growth that led to the big mistakes of 1937 and 1997. It's way too soon to declare victory.
 What about the claim that the Fed is risking inflation? It isn't. Mr. Laffer seems panicked by a rapid rise in the monetary base, the sum of currency in circulation and the reserves of banks. But a rising monetary base isn't inflationary when you're in a liquidity trap. America's monetary base doubled between 1929 and 1939; prices fell 19 percent. Japan's monetary base rose 85 percent between 1997 and 2003; deflation continued apace. 
 Well then, what about all that government borrowing? All it's doing is offsetting a plunge in private borrowing -- total borrowing is down, not up. Indeed, if the government weren't running a big deficit right now, the economy would probably be well on its way to a full-fledged depression.
 Oh, and investors' growing confidence that we'll manage to avoid a full-fledged depression -- not the pressure of government borrowing -- explains the recent rise in long-term interest rates. These rates, by the way, are still low by historical standards. They're just not as low as they were at the peak of the panic, earlier this year. 
 To sum up: A few months ago the U.S. economy was in danger of falling into depression. Aggressive monetary policy and deficit spending have, for the time being, averted that danger. And suddenly critics are demanding that we call the whole thing off, and revert to business as usual.
 Those demands should be ignored. It's much too soon to give up on policies that have, at most, pulled us a few inches back from the edge of the abyss.

HEADLINE: In Reversal, Netanyahu Backs Palestinian State, With Caveats

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
The prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sunday endorsed for the first time the principle of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, but on condition that the state was demilitarized and that the Palestinians recognized Israel as the state of the Jewish people.
 In a much-anticipated speech meant in part as an answer to President Obama's address in Cairo on June 4, Mr. Netanyahu reversed his longstanding opposition to Palestinian statehood, a move seen as a concession to American pressure.
 But he firmly rejected American demands for a complete freeze on Israeli settlements in the West Bank, the subject of a rare public dispute between Israel and its most important ally on an issue seen as critical to peace negotiations.
 And even his assent on Palestinian statehood, given the caveats, was immediately rejected as a nonstarter by Palestinians. 
 In a half-hour speech broadcast live in Israel, Mr. Netanyahu, the leader of the conservative Likud Party, laid out what he called his ''vision of peace'': ''In this small land of ours, two peoples live freely, side-by-side, in amity and mutual respect. Each will have its own flag, its own national anthem, its own government. Neither will threaten the security or survival of the other.''
 But Mr. Netanyahu insisted on ''ironclad'' guarantees from the United States and the international community for Palestinian demilitarization and recognition of Israel's Jewish character.
 Given those conditions, Mr. Netanyahu said, ''We will be ready in a future peace agreement to reach a solution where a demilitarized Palestinian state exists alongside the Jewish state.'' He also said that no new settlements would be created and no more land would be expropriated for expansion, but that ''normal life'' must be allowed to continue in the settlements, a term he has used to mean that limited building should be allowed to continue within existing settlements to accommodate ''natural growth.''
 While this position did not diverge from Mr. Netanyahu's previous statements, he delivered it on Sunday in the context of a speech he had billed as a major foreign policy address, one he had personally urged Mr. Obama to watch. It came 10 days after Mr. Obama bluntly rejected ''the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements'' in his address to the Muslim world in Cairo. 
 The White House reaction was positive, if limited, focusing on what it called ''the important step forward'' of Mr. Netanyahu's support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
 In a statement, the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, reiterated the president's vow for a two-state solution that ''can and must ensure both Israel's security and the fulfillment of the Palestinians' legitimate aspirations for a viable state,'' and he said that Mr. Obama ''welcomes Prime Minister Netanyahu's endorsement of that goal.'' 
 Indeed, in moving closer to the American and international consensus for a two-state solution, Mr. Netanyahu risked alienating right-wing ideologues within his party and his governing coalition. Ron Dermer, the prime minister's director of communications and policy planning, said that in accepting the notion of a Palestinian state, Mr. Netanyahu had ''crossed a personal Rubicon.''
 Citing the biblical vision of Isaiah of swords beaten into plowshares, Mr. Netanyahu said of the Palestinians, ''We do not want to rule over them, to govern their lives, or to impose our flag or our culture on them.'' 
 But beyond the idea of a state, he seemed to offer little room for compromise or negotiation.
 He referred repeatedly to the West Bank, the territory presumed to comprise the bulk of a future Palestinian state, by its biblical name of Judea and Samaria, declaring it ''the land of our forefathers.'' 
 Mr. Netanyahu made no mention of existing frameworks for negotiations, like the American-backed 2003 peace plan known as the road map. 
 He did not address the geographical area a Palestinian state might cover, and he said that the Palestinian refugee problem must be resolved outside Israel's borders, negating the Palestinian demand for a right of return for refugees of the 1948 war and for their millions of descendants.
 He insisted that Jerusalem remain united as the Israeli capital. The Palestinians demand the eastern part of the city as a future capital. 
 ''Benjamin Netanyahu spoke about negotiations, but left us with nothing to negotiate as he systematically took nearly every permanent status issue off the table,'' Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said in a statement. ''Nor did he accept a Palestinian state. Instead, he announced a series of conditions and qualifications that render a viable, independent and sovereign Palestinian state impossible.'' 
 Palestinian negotiators have long refused to recognize Israel as a Jewish state, contending that it would prejudge the refugees' demand for a right of return and would be detrimental to the status of Israel's Arab minority. 
 Mr. Dermer, the communications director for Mr. Netanyahu, said that Palestinians' recognition of Israel as a Jewish state was ''not a precondition'' for negotiations. But, he said, ''there will not be an agreement without that recognition.''
 Mr. Netanyahu delivered his speech to an invited audience at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University outside Tel Aviv. The university is an academic bastion of Israel's national-religious camp.
 Timed to coincide with the Israeli evening television news, the speech was rich in Zionist rhetoric and seemed aimed as much at Israelis as at the Obama administration. Experts said it was unlikely to cause a political earthquake here, since it largely expressed the consensus in Israel. 
 ''It was a balanced speech that the coalition can live with,'' said Prof. Efraim Inbar, the director of the Begin-Sadat Center. 
 Contrary to the expectations of many here, Mr. Netanyahu did not make the threat of a nuclear Iran a focal point, though he described it as one of the greatest challenges facing Israel, along with the global economic crisis and forging of peace. 
 He called on Arab leaders to meet with him to discuss peace, and for Arab countries and entrepreneurs to help in lifting the Palestinian economy and to engage in regional projects with Israel. 
 Regarding Gaza, where the militant Islamic movement Hamas holds sway, Mr. Netanyahu said it is up to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority to establish the rule of law there and ''overcome'' the group. 
 Mr. Netanyahu announced a week ago that he would deliver a major policy speech, leading to feverish speculation up to the last minute of what it would contain. The Israeli leader spent much of the last week in consultation with political partners and potential rivals and met twice with the country's experienced and popular president, Shimon Peres.
 Mr. Peres said in a statement that the speech was ''true and courageous'' and that it constituted an opening toward ''direct negotiations for both a regional peace and a bilateral peace between Israel and the Palestinians.''

HEADLINE: Generations Mingle at This Year's Bonnaroo

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, Tenn 

 BODY:
There's nothing hip about the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, where tie-dye is still in fashion and white hair doesn't disqualify a headliner.
 The eighth annual Bonnaroo drew about 75,000 people to 700 acres of farmland here in Manchester, 60 miles from Nashville, for a lineup headlined by a jam band (the reunited Phish, playing three-hour shows on Friday and Sunday), rockers whose careers are measured in decades (Bruce Springsteen, Nine Inch Nails and David Byrne) and rappers who now qualify as old school (the Beastie Boys).
Next Saturday the cable channel Fuse will broadcast excerpts from the festival, which ended Sunday. 
 At Bonnaroo, sweaty temperatures and muddy ground work against any preening, and while the more than 100 acts this year included their share of first-rate indie bands beloved by bloggers -- St. Vincent, Yeasayer, Bon Iver, Of Montreal -- they also featured bluegrass, soul, African rock and comedy (including Jimmy Fallon of ''Late Night''). The festival depends on the entire mix; it may be the only gathering to include Public Enemy, Merle Haggard, Wilco, Girl Talk and King Sunny Ade in the same weekend. 
 Bonnaroo also relies on an audience, mostly camping on the grounds for the weekend, that has envisioned a smiley, benevolent version of hippie hedonism four decades after the fact. 
 Instead of the civil-rights and antiwar furor of the 1960s, Bonnaroo features environmentalism; at the center of the festival, on the way between stages, is a cluster of booths, exhibits and a small solar-powered stage dedicated to ecological activism. (How that squares with the Art of Such n Such, a nightly show of huge, choreographed flames, is unclear.) Among the speakers this year was Robert Kennedy Jr.
 Phish, which changed its mind after playing what it said were its final concerts in 2004, had never performed at Bonnaroo as a group, though all its members have appeared in various jam configurations. 
 Trey Anastasio, the band's guitarist and main singer and songwriter, announced on Friday night that he was ''incredibly happy,'' and so was the set: three hours of Phish at its most euphoric and airborne, zooming through elaborately composed songs like ''Stash'' and ''Free'' and jamming through roots-rock-flavored older songs, like ''Wolfman's Brother,'' and a new one, ''Kill Devil Falls.'' Riffling through idioms like funk, salsa, country-rock and quasi-classical counterpoint -- as well as a jovial version of AC/DC's ''Highway to Hell'' -- Phish demonstrated the jam-band eclecticism that Bonnaroo has turned into a booking policy.
 ''It ain't no sin to be glad you're alive,'' Mr. Springsteen hollered on Saturday night in ''Badlands,'' the foundational text for his current tour, which calls for love, faith and hope in hard times. (For an encore, his band harmonized fervently on Stephen Foster's ''Hard Times.'')
 Playing Bonnaroo, Mr. Springsteen wasn't facing an arena full of longtime fans singing along on every word, but a younger crowd eager to clap and shout la-la's, and as usual, he was far more showman than politician. Mr. Springsteen's three-hour set was sprinkled with tales of economic woe, like the bitter ''Youngstown'' and a version of ''Johnny 99'' turned into a full-tilt Chuck Berry-style romp.
 But he also took requests, including the out-of-season ''Santa Claus Is Coming to Town'' from a whimsical audience member who had brought a man-size Santa Claus poster. Bonnaroo's magnificent main-stage sound system revealed details in the E Street Band's chiming-steamroller arrangements that are lost in arenas, and Mr. Springsteen's set barreled through nearly an hour of encores that were purposeful and jubilant.
 Less than 40 minutes later, Mr. Springsteen's affirmation gave way to Nine Inch Nails' animosity and self-laceration. Trent Reznor's songs place fury, angst and just enough melody at the convergence of disparate kinds of impact: dance beats, electronic jolts, hard-rock guitar and every shade of distortion. The band's live versions of the songs were stark and strategic, ricocheting among genres from verse to verse; at Bonnaroo, they had people dancing. Desolate, minimal meditations gave way to some final blasts, including one of the unexpected collaborations that are part of Bonnaroo: a hard-rock band, the Dillinger Escape Plan, came onstage to add even more crunch. Partway through the set, Mr. Reznor announced that Bonnaroo would be ''our last show ever in the United States,'' suggesting that he intended to retire from touring, though not from making music. ''I'll keep going,'' he said.
 Friday's lineup was dominated by music from, of all places, New York. It harked back to the 1970s and '80s with overlapping sets by the Beastie Boys -- equally hearty in their early, insolent raps and their more responsible later ones -- and by Mr. Byrne, performing songs he wrote with Brian Eno, last year and decades ago, in musically emaciated new arrangements and surrounded by Broadwayish dancers.
 The afternoon lineup preceding them was stronger. TV on the Radio leaned on the funk, gospel and hard-rock underpinnings of its art-rock; Dirty Projectors (joined for one song by Mr. Byrne) turned African guitar filigrees, zigzag melodies and pinpoint staccato vocals into cerebral but effervescent songs.
 Animal Collective's songs bubbled up out of primordial electronic noise, creating dizzying layers of samples and voices. Grizzly Bear's songs were gorgeous, hovering apparitions, with ethereal vocal harmonies facing upheavals of guitar noise. Meanwhile, Al Green was unleashing his falsetto on his 1970s Memphis soul hits; Lucinda Williams was exulting in some of her newer, happier songs; and an entire stage was devoted to African bands -- Mr. Ade from Nigeria, Amadou & Mariam and Vieux Farka Toure from Mali -- kicking up electrified traditional grooves.
 Tradition matters at Bonnaroo: not as something to be kept pure by simple preservation but as an ingredient worth drawing on. On Saturday afternoon the Africans were replaced in the Other Tent -- Bonnaroo's big stages are What, Which, This, That and the Other -- by Tennessee pickers with bluegrass roots like the Tony Rice Unit (led by Mr. Rice on guitar), who can play in deeply traditional style or fuse it with jazz and other possibilities.
 Allen Toussaint, the New Orleans pianist and songwriter, paid partial tribute to Tennessee -- with a boogie-woogie ''Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,'' recorded in Memphis by the Louisiana pianist Jerry Lee Lewis -- before heading back to New Orleans for a Professor Longhair medley. Raphael Saadiq led a band reminiscent of Motown soul -- and for an unexpected bit of Detroit, also belted a protopunk song from Iggy Pop and the Stooges, ''Search and Destroy.''
 In the jam-band spirit, Bonnaroo spurs collaborations. Mr. Toussaint joined Elvis Costello during what had been billed as a solo set, but ended with Mr. Costello leading a full band and singing with the folk-rock songwriter Jenny Lewis. (He appeared during her set, too.) Booker T. Jones of Booker T. and the MG's, the Memphis soul studio band, collaborated at Bonnaroo (and on a recent album) with the Drive-By Truckers, fusing soul organ and Southern rock.
 Wilco, from Chicago, played one of Bonnaroo's most extraordinary sets. Many of Jeff Tweedy's songs, suffused with depression and estrangement, could have been straightforward 1960s and '70s rock, glancing back at the Beatles and Neil Young. But Wilco doesn't play them that way. Strange tangents arise midsong -- faraway keyboard dissonances, streaking and scrabbling guitar crescendos -- and envelop the whole band, only to disappear moments later as if nothing had happened.
 Bonnaroo itself is something like that in the context of the music business, where youthful glamour, hip novelty and studio-perfect disposable hits are still the priorities. For four days, Bonnaroo looms out of the Tennessee mud, jamming gleefully, then it vanishes until next year.

HEADLINE: Dueling Discount Patriotism

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A COUPLE of retailers known for supercheap clothing are singing a different tune for summer: T's for two and two for T's.
 Since 1997, the Old Navy chain, owned by Gap Inc., has offered, at bargain prices, an annual series of patriotic T-shirts for the family for the Fourth of July. The shirts, bearing American flags and the years they are sold, are returning for 2009 at their regular price, $5 each.
 But anyone who saw a newspaper on Sunday might have done a double-take at an advertisement that appeared in Parade magazine. The ad promoted patriotic T-shirts for the family, bearing the year 2009 and maps of the United States festooned with American flags. 
 ''Family. Fun. Summertime savings,'' the headline read. ''Flag T-shirts for the family.'' The price: $3 apiece.
 Who is underselling Old Navy at its own family-friendly game? The behemoth of discount retailing, the Wal-Mart division of Wal-Mart Stores, which is peddling its own flag T's for the second consecutive year.
 The duel over discount patriotism underscores how competitive consumer marketing has become, particularly as the recession continues to depress enthusiasm among shoppers. If something is selling, chances are that an evocative alternate or two will soon turn up elsewhere.
 For instance, as reported last week by AdAge.com, Anheuser-Busch, part of Anheuser-Busch InBev, is bringing out two beers that resemble products from its principal rival, MillerCoors, a joint venture of Molson Coors and SABMiller.
 ''Hey,'' the AdAge.com headline proclaimed, ''Those A.-B. Brands Look Like Miller Beers.'' The echo effect includes a third beer, Bud Light Lime, which was introduced after lime-flavored Miller Chill.
 In soft drinks, Coke Zero, which is intended by the Coca-Cola Company as a diet cola for men, was followed by Pepsi Max, from a unit of PepsiCo, which is billed as ''the first diet cola for men.''
 In fast food, the value menu at Wendy's, now part of the Wendy's/Arby's Group, begat the value menu at Burger King and the dollar menu at McDonald's. And coffee drinkers can barely keep up with the sip-alike products being peddled by McDonald's; the Dunkin' Donuts division of Dunkin' Brands and Starbucks.
 ''Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,'' said Louise Callagy, a spokeswoman for Gap Inc. in San Francisco.
 ''I would say Old Navy owns the category,'' Ms. Callagy said, because ''many families shop every year'' for its flag T-shirts.
 One change for 2009 is that the T's are being upgraded from seasonal to year-round items.
 ''With the economic conditions we're in,'' Ms. Callagy said, ''this is the time for Old Navy to stand out with a brand proposition that's about value, fashion and fun.''
 A spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, Melissa Hill, who is based at the retailer's office in New York, demurred at a suggestion its flag T-shirts were meant to send a message to competitors.
 Rather, ''we offer customers the products that they want at unbeatable prices,'' she wrote in an e-mail message.
 ''We work to be relevant every season,'' Ms. Hill said, and ''this time of year, our customers are very interested in red, white and blue apparel for the family.''
 Wal-Mart plans to sell the patriotic products through the summer, she added.
 In addition to the T's, Wal-Mart has matching flag hats and flip-flops, Ms. Hill said, also $3 each.
 The family flag T-shirts carry the brand name of a Wal-Mart private label, Faded Glory, which raises a question or two: Can Old Glory be Faded Glory? And if, as the saying goes, these colors don't run, can they fade?

HEADLINE: W.H.O. Examines Traffic as Health Hazard

BYLINE: By SARAH ARNQUIST

 BODY:
A vast majority of the world's countries -- 85 percent -- lack adequate laws to address the growing problem of traffic deaths and injuries, according to the World Health Organization's first global report on road safety, released Monday. 
 Traffic injuries are the ninth leading cause of death worldwide, and public health experts say that without intervention they will rise to fifth within 20 years, surpassing AIDS and tuberculosis. 
 ''In many countries, the laws needed to protect people are either not there or are too limited in scope,'' said Dr. Margaret Chan, the health organization's director general, as she announced the findings on Monday in New York. ''Even when the legislation is adequate, the problem we have is enforcement.'' 
 The report was financed by Bloomberg Philanthropies, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg helped announce the findings. 
 The 287-page report is based on data from a 2008 survey of 178 countries, representing 98 percent of the world's population. It builds on a 2004 report that estimated that 1.27 million people die and that 20 million to 50 million were injured annually in traffic accidents. 
 Among the new findings: pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcycle riders make up almost half of the deaths. 
 Creating and enforcing laws that require seat belts and helmets and punish drunken driving is a proven, cost-effective injury prevention strategy, said Dr. Kelly Henning, director of global health programs at Bloomberg Philanthropies. The foundation has invested in pilot road-safety programs in Mexico and Vietnam.
 According to the health organization, about 90 percent of traffic injuries occur in developing countries, and the majority of victims are young, suggesting large economic losses for poor countries.
 In addition to causing tremendous personal suffering, traffic deaths and injuries can impoverish families and burden already strained health systems, said Dr. Etienne Krug, director of injury and violence prevention programs at the health organization.
 ''Very few people realize that this is one of the leading causes of death in the world, and the leading cause of death for young people,'' Dr. Krug said. ''Because it happens one by one, here and there and not in mass events, it gets less attention.''
 The report compiled new data on registered vehicles, traffic laws, enforcement, accidents, injuries and deaths, but data remains incomplete for most of the developing world, Dr. Krug said.
 ''However,'' Dr. Krug said, ''we know from anecdotal evidence that in some hospitals and surgical wards, almost half of the surgery beds are occupied by victims of road traffic crashes.'' 
 Historically, traffic deaths have increased with a nation's economic growth, but poorer countries can incorporate safety strategies into transportation and infrastructure plans now to avoid this pattern, said Tony Bliss, lead road safety specialist at the World Bank.
 ''If we could successfully, over the next 10 or 15 years, turn this around, it would be one of the great 21st-century public health achievements,'' Mr. Bliss said.

SECTION: Section D; Column 0; Science Desk; A CONVERSATION WITH BERT HoLLDOBLER; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 1123 words

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS

 BODY:
At 72, Bert Holldobler, a professor of life sciences at Arizona State University and a professor emeritus at the University of Wurzburg in Germany, is one of the world's great ant experts. Along with his collaborator, E. O. Wilson, Dr. Holldobler won a Pulitzer Prize in 1991 for ''The Ants.'' The two wrote a second book in 2008, ''The Superorganism: The Beauty, Elegance and Strangeness of Insect Societies.''
 Q. HOW DID YOU AND EDWARD O. WILSON BECOME COLLABORATORS?
 A. I met Ed Wilson in the 1970s when I first came to Harvard. We'd both been interested in ants since we were young boys, he in Alabama, I in Bavaria. 
 In Germany, there's a saying, ''Every boy goes through a bug phase.'' Well, Ed and I, we never grew out of ours! The first time that Ed and I traveled together to Costa Rica, we turned over so many logs together, saw so many new things, that we gathered enough information for six research papers.
 As for the friendship: that took time. First, we had collegial respect. We'd have lunch. We'd talk about ants. Like every scientist, we gossiped. Scientists gossip a lot! In German, there's a saying, ''You gossip like a washer-woman!'' I always say, ''No, I gossip like a scientist!'' In Ed's memoir, he said of me -- and this touched me very much -- ''He's like the younger brother I never had.'' 
 Q. HOW DO TWO ALPHA BIOLOGISTS WRITE BOOKS TOGETHER?
 A. We are very different, but we are remarkably complementary. I am basically the experimentalist. Ed is the synthesizer. When Ed reads a paper, he, very quickly, digests it. I read line by line. And sometimes I'll say, ''Ed, this is wrong.'' Then we have lunch and we'll joke around and soon the ball flies quickly. 
 Our friendship was really tested with our last book, ''The Superorganism.'' We agreed on about 89 percent of it. But we disagreed -- and we still do -- about sections in the chapter on evolution. He'd written the first draft. I said, ''Let me rewrite it.'' That took me two months. Later, Ed wrote, ''You may have saved us a great deal of embarrassment, but I still don't agree on several key points. Let me add some footnotes and a dissenting view.'' 
 Amazingly, this never affected the friendship. With Ed Wilson, you can have a strong disagreement and still remain good friends. 
 Q. IN THAT BOOK, YOU AND WILSON WROTE THAT ''INSECT SOCIETIES HAVE MUCH TO TEACH US.'' LIKE WHAT?
 A. Cooperation. The insect societies we study have evolutionary success because they are organized into a division of labor system. Only a relative few species -- ants, honeybees, termites -- have evolved social systems where you have a few reproductive individuals and hundreds or millions of nonreproductive nest mates.
 In ant societies, the nonreproductives do particular tasks that benefit ''the queens,'' who reproduce. This distributed labor system allows the colonies to grow to enormous numbers. There are some species where there's fierce internal competition to become the reproductives. Their colonies are usually small and less successful.
 So when we say ants can teach us something, it's not that we should all aspire to live like an ant. That would be horrible. What ants can teach is that networks of labor distribution, where communications are good and where each group's work benefits the other, are effective. Economists know this.
 Q. So to extrapolate to humans, should we all be happy with our place in the system?
 A. We are really a different species. But we learn from nature and see some analogies, even though it has no evolutionary connect. We should value the work of a craftsman carpenter at the same level as we value the work of an academic person. Each part done in humans with expertise and done well has the same value. 
 I'm not saying that everyone should be paid the same. People have tried and it was a dismal failure. Karl Marx was right, but he picked the wrong species. With the ants, he was right. In their world, the individual is nothing, the society is everything.
 Q. A LOT OF YOUR RESEARCH IS BASED ON OBSERVING ANT BEHAVIOR IN THE WILD. GIVEN THAT MOST ANTS ARE TINY, HOW DO YOU DO THAT?
 A. You just go out and look. Here in Arizona, you don't have to go very far to find desert ants. You see things. You get ideas. You test them out in the lab. We do a lot of genetic testing. We extract the chemicals that the ants make to learn about their communications systems.
 One day I was walking in the mountains south of here and I had this lucky discovery. I saw hundreds of honey ants standing on stilt legs, displaying at each other. I had never seen this before. No one had. 
 What was going on? Through much observation, we realized that this was a territorial tournament. The ants come in opposing parties, do these displays, and somehow, a head count. If the numbers were more or less equal, everyone goes home after a while. But if one party proves to be weak, this tournament quickly moves to the nest entrance of the weaker group. Then the stronger group goes in and kills their queen. 
 Q. IS THIS ANT WARFARE?
 A. Yes. And that led to the discovery of what I call ant slavery, which is what I'm working on now. I'm pulling together about 26 years' worth of observation of it. 
 When the weak group is overrun, the stronger ones capture their pupae and larvae and take them to their own nest. These stolen immature individuals eventually hatch to become workers in the foreign colony. Their lifetime of labor then benefits the raiding group. 
 We've been using genetic testing to prove this. We've been looking at large ant colonies and we find again and again individuals who belong to foreign mothers. So these workers were definitely stolen. When I discovered this, this was amazing. This was the first example of slavery found where ants exploit foreign labor of their own species.
 Q. WHAT FUNCTION DOES IT SERVE?
 A. The same function slavery serves in humans. You get others to do your work for you. 
 Q. Why do so many humans hate ants?
 A. It's a mistake to think that people don't like ants. Many children respond to them. They see that there's a whole society and that ants behave socially. 
 Q. SO WHY DO THESE LOVELY CREATURES BITE ME WHEN I'M SITTING AT THE BEACH?
 A. Because they don't like you to sit where perhaps they have their trail and they want to forage. They want you to move away. It works. 
 Q. DO YOU CALL AN EXTERMINATOR WHEN ANTS INFEST YOUR KITCHEN?
 A. No, I don't mind them. Listen, if you have ants in the house, you take a wet towel and detergent and you wipe over their trail. Do this a couple of times and they'll stay out. People come up after speeches and say, ''But what can we do, we have ants?'' I say, ''Buy a magnifying glass and enjoy watching them.''

HEADLINE: Credit Bailout: Issuers Slashing Card Balances

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
The banks were bailed out last fall, the automobile companies last winter. For Edward McClelland, a writer in Chicago, deliverance finally arrived a few days ago.
 Mr. McClelland's credit card company was calling yet again, wondering when it could expect the next installment on his delinquent account. He proposed paying half of his $5,486 balance and calling the matter even. 
 It's a deal, the account representative immediately said, not even bothering to check with a supervisor. 
 As they confront unprecedented numbers of troubled customers, credit card companies are increasingly doing something they have historically scorned: settling delinquent accounts for substantially less than the amount owed.
 The practice started last fall as the economy worsened. But in recent months, with unemployment topping 9 percent and more people having trouble paying their bills, experts say this approach has risen drastically. 
 They say many credit card issuers have revised internal guidelines to give front-line employees the power to cut deals with consumers. The workers do not even have to wait for customers to call and ask for a break.
 ''Now it's the card company calling you and saying, 'Let's talk turkey,' '' said David Robertson, publisher of the credit industry journal The Nilson Report. 
 Only a few creditors are willing to confirm the practice. Bank of America and American Express say they decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept less than the full balance. Other card companies refuse to discuss the subject, but their trade group, the American Bankers Association, acknowledges that settlements are becoming more common. 
 The shift comes as the financial services industry finds itself losing some of its legendary power. A credit card reform bill that makes it harder to raise rates on existing balances and prevents certain automatic fees flew through Congress and was signed by President Obama in late May.
 Borrowers still have a crushing amount of debt to deal with, however.
 Revolving credit, a close approximation of credit card debt, totaled $939.6 billion in March. The Federal Reserve reported that 6.5 percent of credit card debt was at least 30 days past due in the first quarter, the highest percentage since it began tracking the number in 1991. The amount being written off was also at peak levels.
 After a balance has been delinquent for six months, regulations require the card company to reduce the value of the debt on its books to zero. If a borrower has not paid by this point, chances are he never will.
 ''The creditors would rather have a piece of something now instead of absolutely nothing down the road,'' said Adam K. Levin, the founder of the consumer education Web site Credit.com. 
 Banks and credit card companies are discussing new programs that would, for the first time, allow credit counselors to invoke reductions of principal as a routine part of their strategy, said Jeffrey S. Tenenbaum, a lawyer for many counseling agencies. In the past, counselors could persuade card issuers to adjust interest rates and modify late fees, but the balance was untouchable.
 An example of how quickly the card companies are shifting their approach is in the behavior of HSBC, a major issuer, toward Mr. McClelland.
 He was paying fitfully on his card, which was canceled for delinquency. In April, HSBC offered him full settlement at 20 percent off. He declined. A few weeks later, it agreed to let him pay half. 
 Traditionally, the creditors could play tough with any accounts that became delinquent because the cardholders had assets. The creditors could sue or place a lien on a cardholder's house.
 As the recession grinds on, though, many cardholders have less to lose. Mr. McClelland, 42, is a renter. Since he is self-employed, he has no wages to garnish. But he did not want to feel like a deadbeat. 
 ''Having this over and done with was appealing,'' he said. He raised the agreed-upon $2,743 and sent it off electronically last week. He has spared himself the prospect of years of collection calls.
 HSBC said it did not comment on individual cardholders and would not discuss its policy toward settlements. ''Every customer situation is unique,'' said a spokeswoman, Cindy Savio.
 The card companies, perhaps understandably, do not want to promote the idea that settlements have become merely a matter of asking nicely. The creditors also point out that a delinquency, like a foreclosure, destroys a credit record. 
 And there can be a Catch-22: those with the fewest assets are the likeliest to receive a settlement offer, but they are also the least able to come up with the cash for that final negotiated payment. Some creditors, though, are helpfully letting people stretch this out over months. 
 Still, a line has been crossed, credit experts say.
 ''Even in the early stages of delinquency, settlements can be dramatic,'' said Carmine Dorio, a longtime industry executive who ran collection departments for Citibank, Bank of America and Washington Mutual. 
 During the boom, nonpayers were treated more harshly because, paradoxically, their debt was more valuable. Collection agencies were eager to buy bundles of old debt from the card companies for as much as 15 cents on the dollar. In a healthy economy, even the hopelessly indebted can pay something.
 In this recession, where collection agencies have little hope of collecting from the unemployed, that business model is suffering. Experts say 5 cents on the dollar is now the most a card company can hope to get for its past-due accounts.
 Another factor undermining the card companies is the rise of debt settlement firms. These are profit-making companies that charge fees, nearly always in advance, to bargain with creditors on a consumer's behalf.
 Settlement companies are under fire from regulators, who say they promise much and deliver little. But their ubiquitous ads, which make a settlement seem not only easy but also a moral victory over shamelessly gouging card companies, have done much to spread the idea.
 Although there are few independent statistics on the settlement industry, there is no doubt that some generous deals are being done.
 Consider Bedros Alikcioglu, a gas station owner in Newport Beach, Calif. He owed $112,000 on four cards and was paying $3,000 a month in interest and late fees. ''It was so hard to earn that money, and paying it to nowhere didn't make sense anymore,'' said Mr. Alikcioglu, 75.
 He signed up with a debt settlement company named Hope Financial, which negotiated deals with his creditors to settle for about 35 percent of his balance. Hope Financial is charging Mr. Alikcioglu about 12 percent of his original debt. 
 ''I did not want to leave the legacy of bankruptcy,'' Mr. Alikcioglu said. ''I am now at peace.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Greater Financial Clout, Emerging Powers Prepare to Meet in Russia

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting from New Delhi, Alexei Barrionuevo from Rio de Janeiro, and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Leaders of some of the world's most powerful economies are gathering on Tuesday to plot how they can exert more control over the global financial system as it takes its first wobbly steps toward recovery.
 Yet not an American or Western European will be in the bunch.
 The first summit meeting of the so-called BRIC group -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- is intended to underscore the rising economic clout of these four major developing countries and their demand for a greater voice in the world. And Russia, the group's host and ideological provocateur, is especially interested in using the summit to fire a shot across Washington's bow.
 All four countries have expressed varying degrees of discomfort with Washington's financial stewardship, and are particularly concerned about the value of the dollar at a time of rapidly mounting indebtedness in the United States. At the same time, most economists say the BRIC countries can do little to change the current architecture of the global financial system, and that the outcome of this meeting will be largely symbolic. 
 The BRIC countries comprise about 15 percent of the world economy and, perhaps more important, have about 40 percent of global currency reserves. Brazil, India and China have also weathered the financial crisis better than the world as a whole. 
 While they are far from a monolithic group, they are generally united in their frustration with the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency, which enables Washington to run budget deficits without fears of facing the kind of budgetary day of reckoning that other countries risk.
 The excess dollars fill up in foreign central banks, leaving those countries with a difficult choice: reinvesting the dollars in United States securities or holding them and facing an increase in the value of their own currencies, making their products less competitive in world markets.
 While there have been periodic complaints about the dollar through the years, the criticisms from the BRIC countries have become more frequent and more acerbic lately, and have included calls for a supranational currency to replace the dollar.
 In March, the prime minister of China, Wen Jiabao, expressed concerns about United States budget deficits, suggesting they might lead to inflation, a weaker dollar and rising yields on Treasuries, any one of which would hurt China's $1 trillion investment in American government debt. Later that month, the head of the Chinese central bank called for a new international currency to replace the dollar. 
 For the Kremlin, undermining the dollar as the prevailing medium of exchange reflects a broader Russian belief that the United States exercises a dominance in global affairs that exceeds its diminishing power.
 ''What we need are financial institutions of a completely new type, where particular political issues and motives, and particular countries, will not dominate,'' Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, said this month.
 Senior officials in most of the BRIC governments -- India, which does not depend as much on trade, is something of an exception -- assert that while the United States has acted irresponsibly over the last 30 years by amassing too much debt, they will be the ones who suffer.
 ''The world economy should not remain entangled, so directly and unnecessarily, in the vicissitudes of a single great world power,'' said Roberto Mangabeira Unger, Brazil's minister for strategic affairs. ''The developing countries should not have to see painfully accumulated hard-currency reserves fall under the shadow of major devaluations.''
 China, Brazil and Russia have said recently that they will purchase notes from the International Monetary Fund to begin diversifying their reserves.
 Still, the reality is that even many forceful critics of the dollar see no immediate alternative to it as the vehicle for international trade. No other markets in the world have the depth and liquidity of those in the United States, experts say.
 And the four BRIC countries, while newly emboldened, have starkly different economies and relationships with the United States, complicating their attempts to unite. Each of the four also has a currency that either has been historically unstable or is not easily convertible.
 ''Between the BRIC countries, there is really little in common,'' said Yevgeny G. Yasin, head of research at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. ''Each of them has its own destiny, its own special character, and it will be much more difficult for them to agree among themselves than separately with Western countries.''
 China, whose economy dwarfs those of the other three, depends on the export of manufactured goods to the United States and Europe. Russia sells oil, natural gas and other natural resources abroad. Brazil focuses on agricultural exports, while India's growth has been largely based on its domestic market.
 The four countries do not necessarily do much business with one another. Only two percent of China's trade last year was with Russia, though the countries are neighbors, according to official statistics. 
 At the same time, Brazil announced this year that China had surpassed the United States as its largest trading partner, and said last month that they would look for ways to finance their trade without the dollar. 
 The very notion of the BRIC nations was conceived in 2001 by an economist for Goldman Sachs, and only then embraced by the countries themselves. Their leaders have conducted informal discussions before, but the event on Tuesday in the central Russian city of Yekaterinburg will mark their first formal gathering, officials said.
 Russia has sent somewhat mixed signals recently regarding how determined it is to confront the dollar. Last week, it announced that it would purchase bonds from the International Monetary Fund, but then the finance minister, Aleksei L. Kudrin, acknowledged that the world was not yet ready for another reserve currency.
 Vladimir A. Mau, rector of the Academy of National Economy, a government advisory organization in Moscow, said Russia and the other BRIC countries had legitimate worries that the United States was piling up too much debt. But Mr. Mau said that at this point, he doubted that the Kremlin had any recourse.
 Mr. Unger, the Brazilian minister, agreed, saying that the BRIC countries do not see replacing the dollar with ''heavy-handed, bureaucratic machinery,'' such as a global, European-style Central Bank.
 In China, popular sympathies are with Russian and Brazilian demands for a robust challenge to American control, analysts said.
 Yet there has been no consensus on what a new financial system should look like, and China's dependence on exports and enormous holdings of dollar-denominated assets give it a vested interest in the status quo, leaving China's leaders reluctant to pursue far-reaching changes.
 While China's official news media often give sizable attention to coming international gatherings, they have offered little coverage of the BRIC summit meeting.
 Xu Xiaonian, an economist at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, said the silence reflected a desire not to raise hopes for the meeting. ''What can they agree on? So little,'' Mr. Xu said. ''This meeting is more symbolic than of real effect.''

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Is Sought By Hotelier

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Extended Stay Hotels, the operator of midprice hotels acquired at the peak of the commercial real estate market for $8 billion, filed for bankruptcy protection, hurt by the cutbacks in corporate and leisure travel during the recession. 
 Extended Stay Hotels, a chain based in Spartanburg, S.C., has more than 680 properties in 44 states. It collapsed two years after Lightstone Group, a real estate firm based in Lakewood, N.J., bought it with $7.4 billion in financing. 
 The chain said it had $7.1 billion in assets and $7.6 billion in debts at the end of last year, according to papers filed today in United States Bankruptcy Court in New York.
 Lightstone bought the chain from the private equity firm Blackstone Group in April 2007 in its first purchase in the lodging business. Since then, prices have declined nationwide.
 The hotel industry is enduring its ''weakest year on record,'' according to PKF Hospitality Research, a research firm based in Atlanta. Hotel occupancy in the United States fell 14 percent in the week ended June 6 from a year earlier and average daily room rates were down 11 percent, to $95.90, according to data from Smith Travel Service.
 Blackstone had bought Extended Stay in 2004, when it had 425 hotels, for $2 billion and the assumption of $1.1 billion in debt. It added properties through acquisitions.
 The top holders of Extended Stay secured debt are Wachovia Bank, with claims of $984 million in mezzanine debt and $515 million in mortgage debt; and Bank of America, which claims $958 million in mezzanine debt and $400 million in mortgage debt. A government trust claims $796 million in mezzanine debt and $274 million in mortgage debt.
 (Mezzanine debt incorporates equity-based options and is often used to finance acquisitions and buyouts in a way that places the interests of new owners ahead of those of existing owners in the event of bankruptcy.) 
 The government's Bear Stearns claim is represented in the case by BlackRock, according to the court filing.

HEADLINE: Out of Work, Part Time

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: BERLIN, Conn. 

 BODY:
As companies struggle to make it from recession to recovery, many are turning to a novel but unheralded program that cuts their costs while sparing their workers' jobs.
 Under the program, known as work-sharing, employers reduce their workers' weekly hours and pay, often by 20 or 40 percent, and then states make up some of the lost wages, usually half, from their unemployment funds. 
 Even though 17 states have adopted the program, and many executives and economists hail it as a way to keep workers employed and companies staffed with skilled labor, only a fraction of the businesses and workers that are actually eligible are benefiting. 
 That is largely because of inertia and ignorance, government officials say. Many companies are unaware of the program's existence, and few states advertise it -- even though the program is credited with saving hundreds of thousands of jobs in Germany, whose work-sharing program has inspired other nations. 
 With unemployment in the United States above 9 percent and climbing, pressure is growing on the states that have work-sharing to increase the number of companies and workers that participate, and on the 33 states that don't have work-sharing to embrace the program.
 At his metal-working plant here in Connecticut, Andrew Nowakowski, president of Tri-Star Industries, says the program is good for employers, workers and the economy. 
 ''It's a lot better than layoffs,'' said Mr. Nowakowski, whose skilled machinery operators make metal parts for products as diverse as cellphones and car engines.
 His 29 nonmanagerial employees now work three- or four-day weeks. ''The alternative would have been to lay off three to seven workers,'' he said, ''but that would mean that when things become busier, I'd run the risk of not having the trained people I need.''
 Tri-Star's employees like the program even though it means lower take-home pay. ''Without this, it would have been four or five guys out the door, and one of them could have been me,'' said John Drzata, who runs an elaborate, five-spindle precision lathe that etches threading into metal parts.
 Jim Cassidy, who works Monday through Wednesday, uses the extra days off to go camping in the Berkshires, although some workers use them to look for spare jobs, like painting. 
 ''We get to keep our jobs and keep our benefits,'' Mr. Cassidy said. ''You lose your job, you lose everything.'' 
 The State of Connecticut makes up more than half the wages the workers lose because of shorter workweeks. New York participates in the program, too. 
 States have different unemployment insurance formulas, but generally, a worker being paid $600 a week, if laid off, might receive $300 in jobless benefits. With work-sharing, if that worker's hours drop 20 percent, wages would fall to $480 and work-sharing would make up at least half of the lost wages ($60), for a total of $540 a week. 
 With savings from reduced income taxes and from commuting fewer days, some workers nearly break even.
 The state and federal governments have hardly publicized work-sharing, in contrast to the European Union, whose leaders have urged the Continent's employers to embrace work-sharing to combat rising unemployment.
 But since the downturn began, some states have beaten the drum to make sure more employers are aware of the program. Mr. Nowakowski first learned of Connecticut's program last October when a state official phoned his office manager to publicize it.
 As a result of such outreach efforts, 5,000 Connecticut workers are participating in work-sharing, up from 250 a year ago. 
 In Washington State, 39,119 are participating, up from 6,039 a year ago. And in Massachusetts, 10,127 workers are, compared to 621 a year ago -- and 458 employers, up from 31 last year.
 ''I frankly don't understand why there aren't more states that participate in this program,'' said Suzanne Bump, the Massachusetts secretary of labor and workforce development. 
 Many states are not participating because they did not focus on the program during good times and because it could create new burdens and paperwork for already overloaded unemployment agencies. ''But that pales compared to the program's benefits,'' said M. Patricia Smith, the New York State labor commissioner. 
 Typically, participating employers file a weekly report of each employee's reduced hours, and a week or two later, workers receive partial unemployment benefits, often called short-time compensation. 
 Some states limit work-sharing benefits to employees who had been working 35 or more hours a week before the cutbacks. Other states allow part-timers to participate. Some states give employers just two options: having employees work 24- or 32-hour weeks; others let companies cut employees' hours anywhere from 10 to 60 percent. 
 Most states require employers to continue providing full-time benefits, like health coverage, to employees on reduced hours. 
 At Columbia Steel Casting, a 350-employee foundry in Portland, Ore., management likes work-sharing because when it lays off skilled machinists, they are hard to lure back. They often take jobs at Boeing.
 ''People don't quit other jobs to come to work in foundries where it's extremely hot,'' said John Birkhofer, a human resources manager. ''It's different from when you're hiring counterpeople for McDonald's.''
 Mr. Nowakowski said it took 18 months to train apprentices to use Tri-Star's complicated lathes. ''I would do whatever I could to maintain this core group of employees long term,'' he said.
 Work-sharing will not prevent layoffs in industries in a profound tailspin, like automobiles. Economists say it is for companies confident of a rebound when the economy improves.
 ''The great thing about this program is you're not decimating your company,'' said Linda Saloom, business operations manager at Saloom Furniture, in Winchendon, Mass., whose employees are working 32-hour weeks. ''Our company is not broken. The economy is broken.'' 
 Several executives that use work-sharing explained companies' choices. Needing to cut payroll by 10 percent for six months, recession-plagued managers could lay off 10 percent of their workers, perhaps incurring anger and heavy severance payments. Or they could use work-sharing, avoiding severance payments and the expense of rehiring and retraining later.
 ''Just the ability to hang on to people in tough times and not force them out the door is good for morale,'' said David Edgar, vice president for human resources at Reflexite, a manufacturer based in Avon, Conn., that makes reflective material for highway signs, motorcycle helmets and roadwork vests. 
 Mr. Edgar acknowledged there were limits. ''I don't think people would want to be on a 32- or 24-hour weeks for seven, eight months,'' he said. ''There might be a tipping point when people ask, 'When do we get some layoffs so we can get back to 40 hours?' '' 
 Reflexite cut most employees' hours from February through April, but with orders increasing as highway construction picks up under the stimulus plan, all workers are now back at 40 hours. 
 ''A lot of my friends got laid off at other companies,'' said Dave Korncavage, a logistics supervisor and 19-year employee at Reflexite. ''They're hoping to get called back, but maybe that won't happen. Their employers don't have anything creative like this. Maybe if they did, my friends would still have a job.''

HEADLINE: Investors Back in Market For British Real Estate

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
Nick Leslau, one of Britain's wealthiest property entrepreneurs, got out of the market just before it turned down in 2007. Now he and a small but growing number of other investors say they think it is time to start buying again. 
 Mr. Leslau set up the Max Property Group last month and raised $:200 million ($329 million) selling shares in what was Britain's first initial public offering this year. Interest in the stock was so great that Mr. Leslau cut the investor road show short by a week, but the share sale was still oversubscribed. 
 Indeed, at least three British investment firms announced plans to raise about $240 million each for property purchases over the last month amid signs that yields have started to stabilize.
 Investors returning to the battered British commercial property market are snapping up offices and shopping centers for 75 percent less than at the peak of the market in 2007, according to the real estate adviser DTZ. 
 That decline was less than the 89 percent drop in the United States or 80 percent in the Asia Pacific region. But in Britain, the speed of the decline was faster -- transaction volumes shrank 51 percent in the three months after their peak compared with 35 percent in the United States and 19 percent in Asia. 
 Some analysts said this rapid correction was now helping the British market recover faster than those in New York, Tokyo or Frankfurt. 
 ''You never know the bottom of the market until it's passed, but our feeling is we're close,'' said Mr. Leslau, who is considering hundreds of millions of pounds worth of property for investment. ''We have a strong feeling that the market could be like in the 1990s.''
 During that economic downturn, Mr. Leslau made his fortune buying commercial real estate on the cheap and redeveloping it. 
 Today, Britain is suffering from one of the deepest recessions since World War II. Banks are still reluctant to lend, slowing down any recovery, and unemployment continues to rise, pushing rents lower as vacancy rates, especially in London's financial district, climb toward 10 percent. But a drop in the British currency over the last year attracted some foreign investors while others are looking for a hedge against inflation and are attracted by lower prices and interest rates.
 Britain also looks better positioned than the United States to lead a recovery in the commercial real estate market even as the residential property market continues to struggle, according to DTZ.
 ''London repriced very sharply,'' said Tony McGough, global head of forecasting at DTZ in London. ''So much of the bad news is out of the way and rents dropped so much that even if we haven't yet hit bottom, we're close. New York is not there yet.''
 Dan Fasulo, head of research for Real Capital Analytics, estimates London's market cycle is about six months ahead that of New York. Some analysts attribute the lag in the cycle partly to greater price transparency in the British market, where property funds traditionally have more smaller investors. When the market dropped, many asked for their money back, forcing companies to value their assets almost on a monthly basis. 
 Britain's market is also less financed by commercial mortgage-backed securities and more through commercial bank loans.
 Some analysts remain skeptical and predict the market will only recover marginally by the middle of next year. But several property investors have started to invest already. 
 London & Stamford, the property investor run by Raymond Mould and Patrick Vaughan, raised $:285 million in an initial share sale in 2007 but waited until the beginning of this year to make its first purchase. It bought One Fleet Place, an office building in London's financial district, for $:74 million, a 45 percent discount to its estimated value at the peak of the market. It has acquired four more properties since.
 ''There are definitely more opportunities since the beginning of the year because values have fallen enough and there is a certain sense of reality that set in,'' Mr. Vaughan said.
 Some overseas investors are also interested. The Oman Investment Fund bought a majority stake in One Bishops Square in London's financial district earlier this month, a deal that valued the building, the home of the law firm Allen & Overy, at 8 percent below its value at the end of last year. The vendor was Hammerson, one of Britain's largest real estate investment trusts, which needed urgently to repay debt.
 Orchard Street Investment Management, a fund backed by the Singapore government, agreed on Monday to buy an office building in the same area for $:21.4 million, including a tenant with a 12-year lease. 
 Great Portland Estates, another real estate investor, announced a $:175 million rights issue last month and pledged to invest the funds mainly in prime retail space around London's Oxford Street before the end of next year. The property investor Shaftesbury also announced a rights issue to buy discounted properties. 
 The sudden revival of interest in commercial property created fierce competition for certain top assets with long-term tenants that are still difficult to find. Chris Bartram, chairman of Orchard Street, said he noticed that competition for top assets started to heat up after the beginning of the year, because the British government's asset-protection plan helped to avoid a deluge of forced asset sales.
 But Mr. Bartram warned that if the banks became more aggressive in cleaning up their balance sheets it could depress values and stifle a recovery. ''If we now have an uptick in the market we could see this used by the banks as an excuse to sell all the assets in the protection scheme,'' he said.
 At the same time, the drying up of credit and the recession halted many new developments in the center of London, which means that -- unlike in the 1990s property downturn -- the market may not suffer from a vast property oversupply. According to Mr. Bartram, that means that even though risks remain and a recovery might be bumpy, ''2009 is undoubtedly an unrivaled opportunity.''
 ''The seeds for the next recovery are already sown today,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 25, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on June 16 about investors returning to the British commercial property market referred incorrectly to statistics on sales declines compiled by the real estate adviser DTZ. The figures -- which included a 75 percent drop from the market's peak in Britain, 89 percent in the United States and 80 percent in the Asia Pacific region -- referred to the value of all transactions, not to the prices paid.

PERSON: Philip Curtin 

HEADLINE: Philip Curtin, 87, Scholar of Slave Trade

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Philip D. Curtin, a wide-ranging and influential historian whose pioneering use of modern statistical methods to determine the extent of the Atlantic slave trade suggested that far fewer slaves were transported from Africa than had previously been thought, died June 4 in West Chester, Pa. He was 87 and lived in Kennett Square, Pa.
 The cause was pneumonia, said his wife, Anne. 
 In ''The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census'' (1969), Mr. Curtin followed two widely used estimates of the number of slaves transported from Africa back to their origins, and then applied quantitative methods to come up with his own figure: 9 million to 10 million, with a 20 percent margin of error. 
 The earlier estimates had been based on supposition, as it turned out. Mr. Curtin's figure, based on scrutiny of shipping contracts and port data, was substantially less than the widely repeated figure of 20 million, which, he showed, was an extrapolation from now-lost records pertaining to Jamaica, and the figure of 15 million used by W. E. B. Du Bois, who repeated a figure arrived at by Edward Dunbar, a 19th-century abolitionist. 
 Before Mr. Curtin published his book, estimates varied wildly, from as few as 3.5 million to as many as 100 million. All these numbers, Mr. Curtin, owed their longevity to ''a vast inertia, as historians have copied over and over again the flimsy results of insubstantial guesswork.'' 
 The debate continues, but the range has narrowed.
 Although he was known principally for his studies of the slave trade and the economic history of Africa, Mr. Curtin later took on even larger questions of human interaction across large geographic areas and periods of time.
 ''Once he had established himself as the foremost African historian in the United States, he extended his range to world history,'' said William T. Rowe, chairman of the history department at Johns Hopkins University. ''He was a proselytizer for a kind of world history that treated every human society with equal dignity and equal weight, interacting with each other and having indigenous processes of change, not simply waiting for the Europeans or the Arabs to arrive.''
 Philip DeArmond Curtin was born in Philadelphia and grew up in Webster Springs, W. Va., where his family owned a coal and timber business. After a three-year interruption for service in the Merchant Marine, he graduated from Swarthmore College in 1948. In 1953, he received a doctorate in history from Harvard, writing his dissertation on the history and economy of Jamaica in the mid-19th century.
 At the University of Wisconsin, where he began teaching in 1956, he and a colleague, Jan Vansina, started a department of African languages and literature, helping to establish African studies as an academic discipline in the United States. From 1975 until his retirement in 1998, he taught at Johns Hopkins.
 In addition to his work on African societies, notably ''Precolonial African History'' (1974) and ''Economic Change in Precolonial Africa'' (1974), Mr. Curtin commanded an academic readership outside his field for books like ''Cross-Cultural Trade in World History'' (1984), ''Death by Migration: Europe's Encounter With the Tropical World in the 19th Century'' (1989) and ''The Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex'' (1990).

HEADLINE: Canada: Bombardier Cuts Business Jet Forecast

BYLINE: By ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Bombardier is reducing its 10-year industry forecast for business jet deliveries by nearly 15 percent from last year because of the global recession. The company says it now expects there will be 11,500 business jets delivered by the industry from 2009 to 2018. Waning demand for business planes has forced manufacturers to lay off thousands of employees as they reduce production. Bombardier has announced that 4,360 employees will be laid off in Canada, the United States and Northern Ireland.

HEADLINE: Shares in Retreat on Fear Of Slow, Late Recovery

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY; Louise Story contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Hopes for an economic rebound lifted Wall Street off the mat this spring. But on Monday, investors took cover in a broad sell-off as they faced the prospect that any recovery could be slow and a long way off.
 In an about-face, stock markets skidded as the prices of oil, gold and other commodities declined. Government bonds regained some ground, and the wavering dollar strengthened after Russia's finance minister expressed confidence in it. 
 Analysts said the declines did not seem to presage another dive in stocks, but they predicted that Wall Street would veer between gains and losses in coming months as investors tried to divine whether the economy was headed for recovery or stagnation.
 ''The global economy is still shrinking, even if at a slower rate,'' said Bart Melek, global commodity strategist at BMO Capital Markets. ''Things are pretty weak, and they're going to continue to be weak.''
 In its largest one-day losses since mid-May, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 187.13 points, or 2.13 percent, to 8,612.13, again turning negative for the year. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.4 percent, or 22.49 points, to 923.72. The Nasdaq composite index was 2.28 percent, or 42.42 points, lower at 1,816.38.
 ''Investors have to reposition their expectations to two steps forward and one and a half steps back, rather than straight up or straight down,'' said Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer at the Bessemer Trust. ''This will take time to work through.''
 Unlike during the financial-led declines of last year and this winter, industrial companies and producers of basic materials like chemicals and steel fell the most on lower commodity prices. Shares of the equipment maker Caterpillar declined more than 4 percent, and the aluminum maker Alcoa dipped 6.5 percent.
 Two new reports helped to underscore the difficult times ahead for the American economy.
 Manufacturing conditions in New York State worsened in June after rebounding from their lowest levels on record, according to the Federal Reserve's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. Orders remained low and shipments fell, blunting some hopes that the economy had reached a definitive bottom.
 And the National Association of Homebuilders' gauge of the housing market fell one point in June from May, reflecting the industry's continuing concerns about the market. Home construction has dropped substantially from last year as builders contend with a glut of cheap foreclosure properties, tight credit conditions and reluctant buyers.
 Talk of controlling stimulus spending from global finance leaders also seemed to frighten investors, raising concerns that the world economy was not yet ready to stand on its own feet. 
 At a weekend meeting in Italy, finance ministers of the Group of 8 industrialized nations discussed how to undo bank bailouts and big government deficits as economic conditions improved and inflation started to resume. For many investors, it was apparently too soon for the subject.
 The financial system is no longer in danger of tumbling into the abyss, but unemployment is climbing, consumers are wary about spending and investors are unsure about how rising gasoline prices and higher mortgage rates could affect any incipient economic recovery.
 ''It's remarkable -- here we are, 40 percent off the lows and 40 percent off the highs, trapped in the middle,'' said Jeffrey Kleintop, the chief market strategist at LPL Financial. ''The stock market's trapped in a tug of war here.''
 Others say that dips in stock markets are actually encouraging investors to return. Stocks like Bank of America and Citigroup have soared from their lows of early March, and the S.& P. 500 is narrowly ahead for the year. 
 ''All you hear from the pros out there is, 'I'm waiting for a pullback,' '' said David Chalupnik, director of equities at First American Funds. ''You have a massive amount of cash out there, and that cash is looking for better returns.''
 Oil prices, which had surged from $33 a barrel on hopes for a recovery in demand, settled at $70.62 barrel, down $1.42. While some analysts expect gasoline and oil costs to rise during the summer driving season, others say the sharp increase in oil prices is not consistent with fundamental weakness in consumption.
 The secretary of the Treasury, Timothy F. Geithner, during a question-and-answer session Monday on Manhattan, reiterated the administration's position on the recovering financial system.
 ''When the president came in, we had a financial system that was very damaged,'' Mr. Geithner said at a conference hosted by Time Warner. ''If you look at where we are today, we really made substantial progress.''
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose 20/32, to 95 5/32 from 94 17/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 3.71 percent, from 3.79 percent on Friday. Although many investors are betting that Treasury prices will slide further as the economy bottoms and the government keeps issuing hundreds of billions in debt, some analysts say the declines have gone too far.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Microsoft Sues Three In Click-Fraud Scheme

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
AFTER an investigation that took more than a year, Microsoft has filed its first lawsuit over click fraud, where people manipulate clicks on a Web advertisement.
 Microsoft filed the civil complaint on Monday in United States District Court in Seattle against Eric Lam, Gordon Lam and Melanie Suen, of Vancouver, British Columbia, along with several corporation names they were believed to have used, and several unnamed parties. 
 Microsoft is seeking at least $750,000 in damages. That might seem a small amount for a company that had sales of $13.7 billion last quarter. But about one in every seven clicks on an advertisement is estimated to be fraudulent, according to the traffic analysis firm ClickForensics, and Microsoft is trying to make that kind of deception more expensive for perpetrators. 
 ''We have decided to become more active in the commercial fraud area on the enforcement side,'' said Tim Cranton, associate general counsel for Microsoft. ''The theory is you can change the economics around crime or fraud by making it more expensive.''
 Jeremy Fain, the vice president of industry services for the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group, said that Microsoft's lawsuit was more than a warning shot.
 ''Legally, if you commit wire fraud or mail fraud, there's a lot of very stiff penalties for that, where we don't have a lot of precedents, legally, from an Internet perspective yet,'' he said. ''It's really meant to try to create more of a legal precedent, and more of a legal library of cases to draw from in the future.''
 Gordon Lam, reached on Monday evening, said he had not yet seen the filing and could not comment further.
 Microsoft said it found a pattern of click fraud on its search pages, where lists ranked by relevance and popularity appear alongside a handful of paid results. Advertisers bid on what they will pay to appear in the paid-search results for certain keywords. The more an advertiser pays, the higher they are in that list, and advertisers usually pay for each click on their ad.
 In March 2008, several auto insurance advertisers began complaining to Microsoft that traffic to their ads was spiking suspiciously. Microsoft looked at the searches being conducted, and noticed that searches for keywords like ''auto insurance quote'' had sharply increased. And clicks to the advertisers appearing at the top of the paid-search results listings for those terms were high.
 Microsoft investigators noticed there was an oddly similar pattern in a seemingly unrelated area, advertisements for the game World of Warcraft. Though investigators weren't sure how the two were connected, they began to see some similarities. Although traffic appeared to come from different computers, it was actually coming from two proxy servers, which mask the original address of a click. 
 Microsoft began trying to stop the suspect traffic, but a little game evolved. Microsoft would block a server, or block a certain level of traffic for those advertisements, but whoever was on the other side of the clicks kept finding new ways around the company's fixes.
 ''They're basically just trying to figure out what our filters and technology tools are going to flag, and seeing if they can change their thresholds to get around it,'' Mr. Cranton said. ''Then we figure out what they've done and we change our thresholds, and it goes back and forth.''
 Microsoft didn't know why someone would be interested in both World of Warcraft and auto insurance ads, though, until a third party told investigators that an advertiser for World of Warcraft keywords named Eric Lam was also taking a fee for directing traffic to auto insurance sites. Investigators figured out that seven different accounts, registered under different individual and company names, were linked to Mr. Lam and two other defendants, Gordon Lam and Melanie Suen, believed to be Mr. Lam's brother and mother.
 Microsoft's theory is that Mr. Lam was running or working for low-ranking sites that took potential client information for auto insurers. The complaint said that he directed traffic to competitors' Web sites so they would pay for those clicks and exhaust their advertising budgets quickly, which let the lower-ranking sites that he sponsored move up in the paid-search results. 
 When people clicked through to his site, it asked them to supply contact information, which he then resold to auto insurance companies, according to Microsoft's complaint, which estimated his profit at $250,000. In the complaint, it also said it had to credit back $1.5 million to advertisers because of the Lams' alleged fake clicks. Microsoft is seeking $750,000 in damages from the defendants. 
 Although small advertisers have sued search firms, complaining the firms did not do enough to prevent fraudulent clicks, this is among the first cases where a search provider has gone after a suspected perpetrator.
 While Mr. Cranton said that this was not a gigantic case for Microsoft, he said the fraud was ''significant.''
 ''We think there's a good place for enforcement, basically to say, 'You think this is a game, cat and mouse, back and forth. At some point, once we figure out who you are, we're going to hold you accountable for it, it's going to be expensive, and we're going to deter you from doing it because you're ripping off advertisers and people online,' '' he said.

HEADLINE: Titlenomics, Or Creating Best Sellers

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
The release of ''womenomics'' (by Claire Shipman and Katty Kay) this month is just the latest example of publishers trying to knock off the title of ''Freakonomics,'' the best-selling 2005 book by Steven D. Levitt, an economist, and Stephen J. Dubner, a journalist.
 Although some critics initially complained about that book's ''annoying title,'' ''Freakonomics'' was an instant success, generating, among other things, a column in The New York Times Magazine, a blog on the Times Web site (freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com), and a planned documentary.
 So it's no surprise that other authors hope to benefit from the reflected glory. Last summer ''Obamanomics'' and ''Slackonomics'' appeared. This year ''Invent-onomics 101'' made its debut. And in the fall ''Scroogenomics: Why You Shouldn't Buy Presents for the Holidays'' will hit bookstores. 
 Capitalizing on popular titles has a long pedigree in the publishing industry. A well-turned phrase can give birth to dozens of offspring. Edward Gibbon's monumental ''History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,'' first published in 1776, has inspired variants for more than two centuries. Similarly titled books have chronicled the slide of other empires (the British, Ottoman, Japanese, American, Freudian); institutions (the C.I.A., the Roman Catholic Church, the American automobile industry, Hollywood, The Saturday Evening Post, the British aristocracy, the American programmer) and eternal ideals (truth and love goddesses).
 Awkward appendages have been added, as in ''Camden After the Fall: Decline and Renewal in a Post-Industrial City (Politics and Culture in Modern America).'' Publishers have demoted the phrase to a subtitle (''Chasing Aphrodite: The Decline and Fall of the World's Richest Museum''). Punctuation has been added -- ''The Decline (And Fall?) of the Income Tax'' -- while humorists have intuitively understood its outsize appeal (''The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody'').
 Eamon Dolan, vice president and editor in chief of the Penguin Press, explained that the title had to communicate the theme of a book almost instantly, which is why publishers so often use something familiar. A title like ''Prozac Nation'' or ''Fast Food Nation'' (which Penguin published) ''conveys a pretty nuanced constellation of ideas fairly quickly,'' he said, and gets across the idea that ''our entire society can reasonably be seen through that lens.''
 At the same time, he added, ''the title is trying to do something on an emotional level,'' to make the reader pause.
 Perhaps that is why titles that make extravagant, impossible declarations are so pervasive. Francis Fukuyama, an international political economist, hit the sweet spot with his influential 1992 post-cold-war treatise, ''The End of History and the Last Man,'' which combined hyperbole with a seeming paradox. (Absent a supernova here, how could history end?).
 Soon publishers were handing us the end of prosperity and the end of poverty; the end of food, which perhaps was the inspiration for the end of overeating; the end of America, followed by the end of American exceptionalism; the end of religion, the end of the Jews (a novel), the end of faith as well as the end of materialism; the end of the present world, the end of your world and the end of the world as we know it; the end of empire, memory, education, free speech, oil, fashion and money; the end of lawyers? (given the question mark, apparently more uncertain than the end of the present world).
 At least six books in the past decade have used ''the end of the beginning,'' including three novels, two histories and a children's book called ''The End of the Beginning: Being the Adventures of a Small Snail (and an Even Smaller Ant),'' although in fairness, Winston Churchill, who used the phrase in a famous 1943 speech, should really get the credit.
 Finally, Robert Kagan, the conservative foreign-policy strategist, turned Mr. Fukuyama's title on its head with his 2008 book, ''The Return of History and the End of Dreams.''
 Exorbitant claims are inherent in another title genre: things that have changed the world. That list includes books, ideas, beliefs, decisions, inventions, plants, bridges, gigs, battles, speeches, photographs and molecules. Some authors prefer a single item: the ocean (Atlantic), voyage (the Mayflower's), car (Model T), corporation (East India Company), business strategy (franchising), telescope (Galileo's), painting (Picasso's ''Guernica'') and Olympics (Rome, 1960). Others favor a set: the 5 equations, the 10 geographical ideas, the 12 books, the 50 battles, the 100 maps, the 1,001 inventions.
 Multiple examples, however, raise a perplexing question: which achievement is more impressive, the discovery of, say, the five equations that changed the world or the one (E = mc2) that managed to do the job on its own?
 The longer the list, the less likely the chance of wretched exaggeration. Yet somehow the feat does not seem quite as impressive once the numbers increase. Some writers claim to have found the single year that changed the world -- A.D. 33 (Jesus' crucifixion), 1968 (the worldwide youth revolt) or 1989 (the fall of the Berlin Wall) -- yet the historian Margaret MacMillan managed to narrow it down to six months (the half year in 1919 when the four powers hammered out the Treaty of Versailles) before realizing she could do one better and identify the single week (in February 1972, when President Richard M. Nixon traveled to China).
 Ultimately, the best locutions are those that credit quotidian, trivial objects with earthshaking influence, like ''Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World,'' by Mark Kurlansky. The more obvious the significance of the subject, the less successful the title. After all, where's the element of surprise or wit in ''A Man Without Equal: Jesus, the Man Who Changed the World''?
 Some of the more unlikely candidates endowed with superhuman powers by authors include ''Tea: The Drink That Changed the World,'' ''Mauve: How One Man Invented a Color That Changed the World,'' ''Banana: The Fate of the Fruit That Changed the World'' and ''Sugar: The Grass That Changed the World.''
 As for ''Freakonomics,'' Mr. Dolan of the Penguin Press said that part of its success was its novelty. The first few knockoffs may be able to capitalize on that, but after a while the title and message contradict each other, he added. ''You can't have a sense of revelation with something that's been repeated four or five times,'' he said. 
 The tricky part is gauging just when the magic wears off. ''Essentially it works until it doesn't work,'' Mr. Dolan said, ''and you hope you're on the right side of that line.''

HEADLINE: Investing Advice for the Small-Business Owner

BYLINE: By JEFF BROWN

 BODY:
To succeed at running a business takes confidence. You make decisions in a hurry, often with imperfect information. That's life in the real world.
 But the skills that serve so well in nurturing a family business or start-up may not serve when it comes to investing the money you take off the table, where you're up against other people who spend all day, every day, thinking about stocks and bonds. A friend of mine is a genius at turning $2 million houses into $4 million houses, but he let his banker put his profits into auction-rate securities just before that market froze. Now he can't get his cash to capitalize on today's great housing deals.
 Another friend runs a successful equipment rental chain. He used a margin account to raise cash for some personal expenses, preferring to borrow at low rates and keep his investments in place. But when stocks dived last winter he had to bolt from a lunch to meet a margin call -- not a welcome distraction when he was working around the clock to save his business. 
 Sure, some small-business people are great investors. But be honest: if you devote 60, 80 or 100 hours a week to your business, do you really have time to read 100 prospectuses to find 10 good stocks? Many financial experts say that despite their business acumen, business owners tend to be fish out of water as investors, quick to fall prey to overconfidence and a sweet line from a self-serving adviser (or a brother-in-law).
 If any of this rings true, this guide and a regular blog feature called The Owner's Money are for you. Their underlying principle: You take plenty of risk in your business; as an investor, you should keep it simple, spread your eggs among many baskets, keep fees and taxes low and tilt the odds in your favor with indexed mutual funds and exchange traded funds.
 At the same time, I understand the entrepreneurial mentality. Entrepreneurs tend to be thrill-seekers. They like to test themselves. They like to take chances. For those who want to devote some play money to more aggressive ideas ... well, I'll talk about that, too. That will be fun.
 But the smart investor will commit only a sliver of assets to that kind of gamble, certainly no more than 10 percent. For the rest of your money, you should construct a supersimple portfolio, one that requires little maintenance. You could do far worse than to simply split your funds among the following (I explain how to allocate below): 
 For stocks, the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX). It is an index fund designed to mirror the performance of the entire United States stock market.
 For bonds, the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBMFX). This, too, is an indexer, designed to track the entire market of investment-grade bonds in the United States.
 For cash, the Vanguard GNMA Fund (VFIIX). This fund invests in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the federal government. It is relatively safe and has been yielding upward of 4 percent.
 Other fund companies, like Fidelity and Charles Schwab, offer similar funds that are perfectly good. I've suggested Vanguard because it specializes in index funds and because, while most fund firms are for-profit operations run for the benefit of shareholders, Vanguard is owned by the people who invest in its products. Vanguard keeps expenses to the bare minimum. 
 In most years, index funds, intended to mirror the market's performance, tend to do better than actively managed funds that constantly scramble for the next hot holding. The average active manager cannot beat the market, and trying to do so, he racks up costs that chew away at returns.
 The model portfolio above is aimed at conforming to what I consider nine proven principles for keeping an investment strategy simple while enhancing prospects for solid returns over the long term. These principles are meant as a starting point rather than a final plan. Use them to guide your do-it-yourself investing, or to put the burden of proof on any adviser who suggests something more complex. Your first question should be: ''Why would that be better than the simple strategy I'm already following?''
 The keep-it-simple approach can help you sleep at night, free of the second-guessing and doubt that plague aggressive traders seduced by the latest fads.
 ALLOCATE PROPERLY. Study after study concludes that the single most important factor in investing success is asset allocation -- the mix of stocks, bonds and cash in a portfolio. Over the long term, stocks have earned in the neighborhood of 10 percent a year, enough to double your money every seven years. But stocks -- as we've been reminded recently -- are too risky for money you will need in the next five to 10 years. The bulk of that money should go into bonds, which are less volatile, though also less profitable, averaging returns of around 5 percent a year. Cash, like bank savings and money-market funds, is very safe but generally earns nothing once inflation has done its damage. A common rule of thumb says one should keep enough cash for 6 to 12 months of expenses. Of the remaining holdings, the bond portion should equal one's age, i.e. 50 percent for a 50-year-old. The rest of your portfolio should be in stocks.
 AVOID CONCENTRATION. People who own businesses or have large stock positions in companies they work for often have too many eggs in one basket. By diversifying -- spreading money among a wide variety of holdings -- you reduce overall risk, since some holdings may be up while others are down. 
 INCREASE YOUR SAVINGS RATE, In the 1980s and '90s people used large investment returns to build their nest eggs, but returns have been far less impressive in recent years. To overcome ho-hum returns, investors need to put more money aside every month.
 USE FUNDS AND E.T.F.'S. The easiest way to diversify and get inexpensive professional management is to invest in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, which are similar to mutual funds but traded like stocks. A single fund can have dozens of stocks or bonds, sometimes hundreds. Very few individual investors are good enough at picking stocks and bonds to beat the performance they can get from funds, especially when broker commissions and other trading costs are factored in.
 USE INDEXING. Rather than try to pick hot stocks or bonds, a large class of mutual funds and E.T.F.'s simply buy and hold securities that reflect an underlying index, such as the Dow Jones industrial average or Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Many studies have shown this to be more successful than ''active management,'' largely because few active managers can consistently pick market-beating investments.
 MINIMIZE TAXES AND FEES. The average actively managed fund charges annual fees equal to about 1.3 percent of the fund's assets, while good indexers charge less than 0.2 percent. In other words, if the managed fund earned nothing over 10 years, fees would reduce its value by 13 percent, while they cut the indexer's value by only 2 percent. Taxes are similarly damaging, and investors are wise to pick funds that keep annual tax bills to a minimum. Indexers minimize taxes by rarely selling assets.
 AVOID ZERO-SUM GAMES. Options, futures and forward contracts are aggressive, speculative instruments that can earn large profits -- or suddenly become worthless. For every dollar won, a dollar is lost by someone else. In the stock market, by contrast, the average investor makes money because the average stock rises in value over time. Individual investors dabbling in options and similar holdings are playing a sucker's game against experienced pros.
 SHUN LEVERAGE. With a margin account at a brokerage, you can invest $2 for every dollar you have, using your holdings as collateral. A 10 percent gain in an asset's price will thus give you a 20 percent profit. But leverage amplifies losses just as much. If your holdings fall in value, the broker may issue a margin call, requiring you to put up more money.
 KEEP TIME ON YOUR SIDE. Investing is a long-term game. Though the recent downturn has shaken a lot of people's confidence, recoveries from bear markets tend to be spectacular. It's very rare for stocks to trail bonds or cash over periods of five or more years. To get the long-term gains you read about -- 10 percent a year for stocks, for example -- you have to leave your money in the market and reinvest all dividends and interest earnings. Many people who pull out of the market in downturns wait too long to get back in, missing the bulk of the rebound. 
 In my regular blog posts, I will try to help you stay on track with your plan, choose which special opportunities to go after and keep up on market developments. I will also be eager to answer your questions.

HEADLINE: Looking for the Little Guy in the Shotgun Union of Two Wall Street Giants

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Embedded in the DNA of the ''Frontline'' franchise is the notion that the little guy is always right and always deserving of our sympathies, apparently even if his personal fortune might exceed many city council budgets by a factor of 100. 
 Strangely, in ''Breaking the Bank,'' the ''Frontline'' documentary running Tuesday on PBS, the little guy is played by Kenneth D. Lewis, Bank of America's chief executive. Stripped of his chairman duties in April by a board disgruntled over the company's acquisition of Merrill Lynch, Mr. Lewis is a banker who earned more than $9 million in 2008, the same year that his corporation accepted a bailout from the federal government and announced a plan to cut at least 30,000 jobs. 
 These facts are ignored in a documentary that angles to paint him as the humble victim of a bullying treasury secretary -- Henry M. Paulson Jr. -- and an entitled Wall Street bonus culture. ''Breaking the Bank,'' which includes interviews with many business reporters, a number from The New York Times, chronicles the strained union between Bank of America and Merrill Lynch in the wake of the fall financial earthquake. It is delivered in ''Frontline's'' sobering, anxious tones and virtually pulp-fiction narration. Informing us of the mood in September 2008, as if we might have already forgotten, the narrator intones: ''The housing bubble had burst. The markets were teetering.'' 
 Mr. Paulson is described as having made his fortune in the '90s ''when the unregulated free market was king.'' His pedigree and that of John A. Thain -- Mr. Thain is the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch, remembered by laymen for an Elle Decor-style office renovation that came to symbolize Wall Street's blindness -- are contrasted with Mr. Lewis's: he grew up the child of a single mother and never landed an Ivy League degree. In the film's analysis Mr. Lewis, who is interviewed here and runs his bank out of Charlotte, N.C., is essentially a Wal-Mart hick occupying a position of moral superiority over his Northeastern peers. 
 The documentary unabashedly portrays Mr. Paulson as a sort of Tony Soprano, forcing the deal on an initially eager Mr. Lewis, giving him little choice even as Mr. Lewis expressed concern about Merrill's huge losses and wanted out, believing the acquisition would send his own bank to ruin. Mr. Lewis was apparently shocked by the depth of Merrill's red ink in December and soured by the ''comp'' demands of its executives. (''Comp -- compensation, bonuses,'' the narrator explains, ''the bankers from Charlotte were now dealing with Wall Street,'' as if avarice were nonexistent south of the Mason-Dixon line, and ''Wall Street'' were a concept foreign to one of the leading banks in the country.)
 ''Breaking the Bank'' is rather unfortunately timed to appear after Mr. Lewis testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last week, when he did not portray himself as a patsy forced by thug government officials into an unhealthy deal. When asked point-blank whether Washington threatened him, he answered that government officials were a strong influence on his decision but not the only factor. Furthermore it was also revealed last week that Congressional investigators looking into the purchase found Mr. Lewis's claim that he was surprised by Merrill's growing losses ''somewhat suspect.''
 Oversimplified, ''Breaking the Bank'' offers no real analysis of the repercussions of the deal on the mechanics of banking. It ends with Elizabeth Warren, chairwoman of the Congressional oversight panel, which oversees the federal bailout, stating what now seems like conventional wisdom about the financial markets among even among fourth graders: ''Well the party's over,'' she says. ''That old economy, that old way of looking at things, that's the old way of putting on a party, it's over. It's over.''

HEADLINE: Small Lines Are Target Of New Rules For Pilots

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Confronting a string of six fatal commuter plane crashes, top federal officials promised on Monday to set new rules to limit fatigue, make the carriers more thoroughly investigate the histories of pilots they want to hire, and push small airlines into adopting the safety programs that are common among big carriers, by threatening to expose the laggards. 
 The new chief of the Federal Aviation Administration, J. Randolph Babbitt, said the major carriers -- the ones whose colors the small airlines use -- should involve themselves more thoroughly in pilot training at the regional carriers, with senior pilots ''mentoring'' the entry-level pilots at the regional lines. 
 Mr. Babbitt and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, along with dozens of airline executives, union officials, F.A.A. inspectors and other safety experts, gathered at a closed-door meeting on regional carrier safety, prompted by the crash on Feb. 12 of a twin-engine turboprop on a flight from Newark to Buffalo. The plane was operated by Colgan Air, doing business as Continental Connection under a contract with Continental Airlines.
 Including that crash, which killed 50, there have been six fatal passenger airline crashes, all involving regional carriers, since the last fatal crash of a major United States carrier's plane, an American Airlines flight in New York in November 2001.
 After the meeting, Mr. LaHood said it was important to ensure that the small airlines' safety was as good as the big ones'. 
 ''For common ordinary citizens, when they get on a United Express flight, they think they're on United Airlines,'' he said.
 The first officer in the Colgan Air turboprop, earning about $24,000 a year and living with her parents on the West Coast, had stayed up all night to fly in to begin her work shift at Newark the day of the fatal flight, and the captain had also showed signs of fatigue, based on data from the cockpit voice recorder. 
 Mr. Babbitt said union officials at the meeting had shown a willingness to foster ''professionalism in the cockpit'' regarding fitness for duty. Mr. Babbitt said the pilots' starting salary at the regional airlines was a problem. 
 ''If you expect to get the best and the brightest, I don't think you're going to get that for very long at $24,000,'' he said, although he added that when he began his career as an airline pilot in 1966, he earned about that much, after adjusting for inflation. 
 But Mr. Babbitt also said F.A.A. rules on the maximum number of hours a pilot could fly or be on duty and the minimum number of hours' rest required between shifts did not take into account the strain of flying six or eight 50-minute flights a day, with multiple takeoffs and landings, versus a single long-distance flight. 
 For years, the aviation agency has tried to modernize the rules on flight and duty hours, but has been unable to win consensus in the industry; airlines do not want to add costs by hiring more pilots, and many pilots like to get in a month's worth of flying in as few days as possible.
 But Mr. Babbitt promised, ''We are going to get a new rule.'' The federal agency writes rules mostly by winning agreement among industry participants, but Mr. Babbitt said that ''at the end of the day, if there's two or three open issues, they will be decided and there will be a rule.''
 Big airlines commonly have safety programs that allow anonymous reporting of problems, to remove the fear of repercussion for pilots. The big carriers also analyze information pulled from on-board equipment that resembles the flight data recorder, to look for safety gaps. Mr. LaHood said the F.A.A. would encourage small airlines, which generally do not have such programs, to adopt them, and publicize the names of those that do not. 
 Both men also called for changes in the law that gives airlines the right to get pilots' detailed work histories from previous employers. That law was passed after a 1995 crash of an American Eagle flight; the pilot had joined the airline four days after being forced to quit by another airline for incompetence.
 Experts now say that the new rule, which requires previous employers to give up information on a job candidate's tenure, does not go far enough. The captain in the crash outside Buffalo had failed three in-cockpit exams, called ''check rides,'' before he came to Colgan, but Colgan knew about only one. Mr. Babbitt said the F.A.A. would now make it clear that airlines are expected to require job applicants to waive their right to privacy, and then ask the F.A.A. for such data.

HEADLINE: You Be Obama

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
Bob Herbert is off today.

 BODY:
Let's say that you are President Obama. You've inherited a health care system that is the insane spawn of a team of evil geniuses from an alien power. Pay is divorced from performance. Users are separated from costs. Rising costs threaten to destroy your nation and everything you hold dear.
 Because you have a lofty perspective on things, you know there are basically two ways to fix this mess. There is the liberal way, in which the government takes over the health care system and decides who gets what. And then there is the conservative way, in which cost-conscious consumers make choices in the context of a competitive marketplace. 
 You also know that these two approaches have one thing in common. They are both currently politically unsellable. Others have tried and perished. There are vast (opposing) armies arrayed against them. The whole issue is a nightmare.
 You are daunted by the challenges in front of you until you remember that by some great act of fortune, you happen to be Barack Obama. This calms you down. You conceive a strategy. 
 The first step in this strategy is table-setting. You will spend the first several months of your administration talking grandly about the need for reform. You will invite all interested parties to the table, and you will serve a great heaping plate of pabulum. You will talk about things that no sentient person could possibly disagree with -- about the need for better information technology and for more preventive care.
 There will be less health care nitty-gritty here than in your average pre-K circle time, but you are getting everybody talking. You are building relationships.
 In stage two, you pass everything over to Congress. You'll need these windbags at the end, so you might as well get them busy at the beginning. This will produce a whirl of White Papers, a flurry of committee activity, a set of legislative rivalries as every chairman in the stable seeks to be the lead horse in the romp to legislative glory. All you have to do is raise a portentous eyebrow from time to time, signaling grand approval of the various proposals as they blow by.
 This brings us to the current stage: The Long Tease. Every player in this game has a favorite idea, and you are open to all of them. The liberals want a public plan, and you're for it. The budget guys are for slashing Medicare reimbursements, and you're for that. The doctors want relief from lawsuits, and you're open to it. The Republicans want you to cap the tax exemption on employee health benefits. You campaigned against that, but you're still privately for it. 
 You ran on a platform of hope and, boy, are you delivering. Every special interest in Washington lives in hope that they will get their pet idea incorporated into the final bill. 
 None will come out and oppose you because they live in hope. Even the different factions in your own administration live in hope. One of your health advisers pretended to smile at one of your economists! 
 This brings you to the final stage, the scrum. This is the set of all-night meetings at the end of the Congressional summer session when all the different pieces actually get put together. 
 You want the scrum to be quick so that the bill is passed before some of the interests groups realize that they've been decapitated. You want the scrum to be frantic so you can tell your allies that their reservations might destroy the whole effort (this is how you are going to get the liberals to water down the public plan and the moderates to loosen their fiscal rectitude).
 The scrum will be an ugly, all-out scramble for dough. You can probably get expanded coverage out of it. You can hammer the hospitals and get much of the $1.2 trillion to pay for the expansion. But you won't be able to honestly address the toughest issues and still hold your coalition. You won't get the kind of structural change that will bring down costs long-term. In the scrum, Congress will embrace the easy stuff and bury the hard stuff.
 Which is why you have MedPAC. That's the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission that you want to turn into a health care Federal Reserve Board -- an aloof technocratic body of experts that will make tough decisions beyond the reach of politics. You can take every thorny issue, throw it to MedPac and consider it solved. 
 Conservatives will claim you're giving enormous power to an unelected bunch of wonks. They'll say that health care is too complicated to be run by experts from Washington. But you'll say that you are rising above politics. You'll have your (partial) health care victory. Not bad for a skinny guy with big ears.

HEADLINE: Murdoch-Berlusconi Feud Plays Out in the Media

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
When Rupert Murdoch and Silvio Berlusconi clash, it is no surprise that the dispute plays out across multiple platforms.
 In Italy, Mr. Berlusconi, the prime minister, has used an interview on one of his own television channels to accuse Mr. Murdoch of mounting a personal attack through a newspaper owned by the News Corporation, his global media empire.
 The articles and editorials in question, in The Times of London, examined the relationship between Mr. Berlusconi, 72, and an 18-year-old model, Noemi Letizia. Mr. Murdoch, appearing on a television channel in New York owned by the News Corporation, discounted Mr. Berlusconi's claims of a personal attack, calling them nonsense and saying that other newspapers, not owned by his company, have been even more critical. 
 On that level, the dispute may seem as farcical as the antics on an Italian variety show. But on another, the rivalry between the men is serious, and is heating up.
 Mr. Berlusconi is ''fearing what Murdoch could do in Italy,'' said Fabrizio Perretti, a professor at Bocconi University in Milan who studies the Italian media industry. ''And that's why he accused Murdoch, even if he isn't really to blame.''
 News Corporation owns Sky Italia, a satellite broadcaster that has dominated the pay-television business in Italy since the company was created in 2003. Mr. Berlusconi's family holding company, Fininvest, is trying to challenge Sky's hold on pay TV. Despite Sky's strong position -- with more then 4.7 million subscribers, it reaches about a quarter of Italian households -- media analysts say changes in the national market could create an opening for Mediaset, a company controlled by Fininvest.
 ''The competition is going to reach a new level of intensity in the second half of this year,'' an analyst at Screen Digest in London, Tim Westcott, said.
 Italian television is unusual because the country has virtually no cable service, and new services that send programming over broadband Internet connections -- a technology that is growing rapidly elsewhere in Europe -- have been slow to catch on.
 Not long after Sky Italia was created, Mediaset started a pay-TV service, using encoded signals broadcast digitally, over the regular airwaves. With set-top boxes and prepaid cards, like those that many Italians use to pay for cellphone services, viewers can unscramble the signals, which include broadcasts of top soccer matches.
 These customers generally pay much less than Sky's subscribers, and Mediaset still generates most of its television revenue from advertising on its free channels. But with advertising in decline, it covets the steady stream of income that pay-TV customers provide, and it has mounted a push to convert its 2.9 million cardholders into long-term subscribers, and to attract new customers.
 As Italian television switches to digital signals, analysts say, it could be easier for Mediaset to convert viewers into paying customers, because they will already have all the necessary technology in place, while Sky's service requires the installation of a satellite dish.
 But Sky is not standing still. As in other markets, like Britain, where the company runs successful pay-television businesses, Sky is placing a big bet on content in an effort to maintain its dominance. 
 Mr. Berlusconi traces the escalation of the feud with Mr. Murdoch to a decision by the government in December to double the value-added tax levied on Sky to 20 percent.
 ''I don't mean to be nasty, but unfortunately with the VAT episode there was a breakdown in relations with the Sky group and with Murdoch's group, which has published a series of very critical articles attacking me,'' Mr. Berlusconi said in an interview on Mediaset's Canale 5. He appeared to be referring to articles and editorials in The Times, one of which was headlined, ''The clown's mask slips.''
 Mr. Murdoch fired back last week in an interview on Fox Business Network. ''I don't control what the editor of The Times says in London or the economists which have been attacking him, saying it's a disgrace to have him as prime minister for the last five years,'' he said
 Perhaps the most surprising thing is that the clash took so long to develop, given the overlapping interests and larger-than-life personas of the two men.
 In the 1990s, between Mr. Berlusconi's first and second terms as prime minister -- he is currently in his third term -- he was widely reported to have discussed the sale of Mediaset to Mr. Murdoch, but the two could not agree on a price. The creation of Sky Italia, through the merger of two satellite companies, occurred during Mr. Berlusconi's second term.
 Other European countries have found it hard to support more than one major pay-TV operator, resulting in a wave of consolidation. As the competition heats up in Italy, analysts say the tensions between Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Berlusconi are unlikely to be the last.
 ''Italy for the next few years is going to be a very interesting television market, both for economic but also for political reasons,'' said Augusto Preta, general manager of ITMedia Consulting in Rome.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 22, 2009

 CORRECTION:
Because of a transcription error, an article last Monday about the rivalry between Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, misquoted Mr. Murdoch's response to the prime minister, who accused Mr. Murdoch of conducting personal attacks on him through the media. Mr. Murdoch said he did not control what the editor of The Times of London or ''The Economist'' say about Mr. Berlusconi. He did not say ''the economists.''

HEADLINE: Settling for Par: Pros More Likely To Play It Safe

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ; Larry Dorman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When PGA Tour golfers from Tiger Woods down to the greenest rookie draw back their putters this week at the United States Open, their scorecards will be sabotaged by a force as human as it is irrational: risk intolerance.
 Even the world's best pros are so consumed with avoiding bogeys that they make putts for birdie discernibly less often than identical-length putts for par, according to a coming paper by two professors at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. After analyzing laser-precise data on more than 1.6 million Tour putts, they estimated that this preference for avoiding a negative (bogey) more than gaining an equal positive (birdie) -- known in economics as loss aversion -- costs the average pro about one stroke per 72-hole tournament, and the top 20 golfers about $1.2 million in prize money a year.
 Contrary to most academic studies involving sports, at which athletes typically scoff, a handful of the tour's top putters did not dispute this finding. Simply put -- if not putt -- they admitted to being spooked enough by bogeys that they will ultimately cost themselves strokes to avoid them. Call it the bogeyman. 
 ''Par putts just seem to be more critical because if you miss you drop a shot -- if you miss a birdie putt, it doesn't seem to have the same effect,'' said Jim Furyk, one of the tour's best putters. 
 Added Justin Leonard: ''When putting for birdie, you realize that, most of the time, it's acceptable to make par. When you're putting for par, there's probably a greater sense of urgency, so therefore you're willing to be more aggressive in order not to drop a shot. It makes sense.''
 Of course, it makes no sense at all: each stroke counts as one on a scorecard, whether for eagle or triple-bogey on any particular hole. The goal is to finish with the fewest strokes, regardless of what each might be artificially termed. All else being equal -- distance from the cup, one's proximity to the lead or cut, the course difficulty and so on -- putts should be handled the same way.
 But they are not, according to the study of almost 200 tour professionals from 2004 through 2008. Using data the tour regularly records on every ball's green location accurate to the nearest inch, the professors found that birdie putts were made about 3 percent less often than otherwise identical putts for par. (In effect, players tell themselves before birdie attempts, ''Let's just get close,'' rather than, ''I have to make this.'') Given that players typically attempt nine birdie putts per round, this cost each golfer about one stroke per tournament -- which can translate to hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money.
 The professors, Devin Pope and Maurice Schweitzer, seemingly anticipated every ''But what about?'' reflex from golf experts. The tendency to miss birdie putts more often existed regardless of the player's general putting or overall skill; round or hole number; putt length; position with respect to the lead or cut; and more.
 As would be expected, the difference decreased on routine short putts and also decreased very far from the hole, where the chance of making the putt is small to begin with. It peaked on putts from about 6 to 12 feet. Even Woods, roundly considered the best putter ever, exhibited the trait at roughly the tour average.
 The finding may become significant among behavioral economists, many of whom have suspected that the loss aversion found through contrived experiments might not be demonstrated by actual, expert competitors vying for high stakes. The paper is being submitted this week for publication in an economic journal.
 ''Even experienced professionals playing for high stakes are not rational,'' Pope said. ''Tiger Woods, the model of perfection and what an economist would think of as a rational agent, even he exhibits these biases. And if he exhibits these biases, why not business leaders? There are a lot of applications.''
 Rather than resist any insight from ivory tower academics, several golfers admitted to handling identical birdie and par putts differently -- and appeared somewhat amused at being found out. Geoff Ogilvy, who made par putts 4.1 percent more often than birdie putts from the same distance, said: ''A par putt seems more final. It shouldn't make any difference, should it?'' And Paul Goydos, who showed the effect at 4.4 percent, said it probably affected him even more on putts for eagle.
 ''If I've got a 25-footer for eagle, it seems like I'm more conservative than with a 25-footer for either birdie or par for whatever reason,'' Goydos said. ''I think the worst thing you can do is three-putt for par on a par 5. That's one that drives me more crazy than anything else. Maybe that's why I'm at the very bottom of the tour in eagles made.''
 But just as quickly as pro golfers admitted to their costly habit, they dismissed the idea of being able to do much about it. Stewart Cink, who showed a 3.3 percent effect, said that try as he might, he would never be able to convince himself that every putt is the same.
 ''You can't fool yourself,'' Cink said. ''But this is one of the reasons why we use sports psychology, and we try to have a preshot routine so we do the same thing, approach every putt the same way. It's not always glamorous, and it's not always possible in reality.''
 The psychological preference to avoid a perceived penalty (losing a stroke relative to par) rather than go for a perceived gain (gaining a stroke) has some benefit. Golfers tended to leave their conservatively stroked birdie putts slightly closer to the cup than more aggressively missed pars -- leading to their making their follow-up shot more often. But that temporary gain was far outweighed by the overall cost in strokes.
 The birdie-versus-par effect varies in ways that many golfers would instinctually predict. The tendency to make similar birdie putts less often than pars becomes less prevalent with each tournament round as players are judged more against one another than against par. The elite tour players generally show less of the trait than marginal ones. And the difference decreases as a player sees himself or his partners handle a particular green.
 But the effect is always there, even if a good reason for it is not.
 ''A 10-footer for par feels more important than one for birdie,'' said Goydos, a two-time winner on the tour. ''The reality is, that's ridiculous. I can't explain it in any way other than that it's subconscious. And pars are O.K. -- bogeys aren't.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg and Council Agree on Budget Raising Sales Tax and Cutting 2,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Pinched by a recession that has hit New York City's financial services hard, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council reached a deal Monday night on a $59.4 billion budget that would increase the sales tax by half a percentage point while reducing the city's work force by roughly 2,000 jobs.
 Despite rising costs for health care and pension payments, the size of the budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 will be $1.5 billion less than the current one, chiefly because of a $5 billion drop in tax collections. 
 Speaking at a news conference in the City Hall rotunda, Mr. Bloomberg and the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, conveyed the hope that the economy would rebound soon so that the following year's budget would be less draconian. But ''if our economy continues to stall,'' Mr. Bloomberg warned, ''this may not be the last word on this year's budget.''
 The deal came as a relief to lawmakers and lobbyists who fretted that the Mr. Bloomberg would make good on his initial threat to shrink the work force by up to 14,000, close firehouses, lay off hundreds of child-care workers and limit library hours. Instead, city officials said that they were able to minimize cuts to what they said were their top priorities -- firehouses, child-care workers and libraries -- though they were less successful in the areas of health care, police training and the arts.
 ''Even in a recession, government's job is to protect and support New Yorkers,'' said Ms. Quinn, who was flanked by more than half of the Council's 51 members.
 Still, the deal was largely devoid of the drama or tension that has characterized previous budgets. After all, the mayor and the Council agreed two weeks ago on the core elements of the revised sales tax package, which is expected to bring in an additional $518 million. The city's sales tax will go up to 8.875 percent. The city will also begin to charge sales tax on clothing over $110; all clothing was previously exempt from such taxes.
 About the only element of anxiety, perhaps, concerned happenings some 150 miles to the north: whether the turmoil in Albany would derail the city's budget, since the State Legislature must approve the tax proposals.
 But on Monday night, Mr. Bloomberg said he was not worried. ''We're confident that the state leaders will do what's right for our citizens,'' he said.
 Mr. Bloomberg had originally proposed that the sales tax be applied to all clothing purchases. He had also pushed for a plan, hailed by some environmentalists, to charge a 5-cent fee on plastic shopping bags. But Ms. Quinn argued that those ideas would have a disproportionate impact on lower-income New Yorkers, and ultimately persuaded Mr. Bloomberg to scrap the plastic bag fee, and exempt any clothing under $110.
 Full details are expected to be released in the next few days, and the City Council is scheduled to vote on the budget on Thursday or Friday. But during the news conference, and in interviews afterward, city officials mentioned a few specifics. 
 As many 2,000 jobs are expected to be reduced through layoffs or attrition, said one administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the numbers are not final. A good number of those are likely to be nonteaching positions in the Department of Education.
 But in a move that was praised by lawmakers and day-care advocates, administration officials said they would provide $8 million in special vouchers for after-school care, which have overwhelmingly benefited Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn neighborhoods like Borough Park and Williamsburg. Previously, the administration had proposed to cut off the money altogether.
 Among other actions, most libraries will remain open six days a week. The 16 firehouses that had been threatened with closing will remain open. And 100 caseworkers who had been threatened with layoffs from the Administration for Children's Services will still have their jobs.
 ''This recession has taken a very hard toll on New Yorkers with the least resources, and I am gratified that my colleagues and I successfully fought to restore cuts proposed by the administration that could have put even more strain on New Yorkers,'' said Councilman Bill de Blasio of Brooklyn, chairman of the General Welfare Committee.
 To be sure, the fait-accompli feel to the budget process this spring differed sharply from last year's, when Mr. Bloomberg and Council leaders clashed until the last minute. Only four days before the legal deadline, in fact, did the two sides reach an agreement to preserve a popular tax cut for homeowners and a $400 rebate, while also adding $129 million in education spending.
 The tension was so palpable last year that Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Quinn even forgot to do the traditional handshake and kiss until prompted by a reporter.
 But that was before the full depth of the recession became apparent. And it was before the successful bid by Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Quinn last fall to upend the city's term limits law, giving city officials an opportunity to run for a third term.
 Next year, however, might be different. The city drained its surplus funds to help the coming fiscal year's budget, and is already facing a $5 billion deficit for the fiscal year beginning in July 2010 -- a prospect, Mr. Bloomberg said, that ''really is troubling.''

HEADLINE: Recession and Revolution

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
Economic fiascos usually have political consequences, and it was only a matter of time before the ripples from the Great Recession produced a crisis in one of the world's more volatile powers. 
 Luckily for America, it's happening in Iran.
 Americans are accustomed to fretting about how theology shapes Iranian politics. But you don't need to be an expert in Shi'a eschatology to understand how last week's volatile election gave way to an exercise in self-discrediting thuggery by Iran's clerical leadership. Worldly forces made the current crisis possible: Stagnating G.D.P., rising joblessness, and runaway inflation. 
 Even if this week's crackdown somehow strengthens Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's hand within the ruling clique, the regime as a whole has been severely weakened. The patina of democracy was a useful thing for the ruling mullahs, and riot police can't make Iran's economic problems go away. (Iranian statistics put unemployment at 17 percent and the inflation rate at 25 percent; the real numbers may be higher. And chronic mismanagement may even send Iran's oil revenues -- the backbone of its faltering economy -- into steep decline.) Their monopoly on violence notwithstanding, the leaders of the Islamic Republic look less like the Nazis of the Middle East, and more like hapless Weimar functionaries watching their country's finances circle the drain.
 In 1930s Europe, a economic crisis toppled democratic governments, and swept dictators into power. Liberal societies seemed ineffectual; authoritarianism was the coming thing. 
 The crash of 2008, though, may end up having the opposite effect. Over the last few years, both American alarmists and anti-American triumphalists have emphasized the disruptive power of populist, semi-authoritarian political actors -- from Ahmadinejad's Iran to Vladimir Putin's Russia to Hugo Chavez's Venezuela. But these regimes, which depend on petro-dollars for stability at home and influence abroad, may prove far more vulnerable to economic dislocation than their democratic rivals.
 Amid the wreckage of the Great Depression, intellectuals and policymakers looked to fascist Italy and the Soviet Union for inspiration. But it's hard to imagine anyone seeing a model in the current crop of authoritarian governments. It's much easier to imagine them being swept away, if the recession endures, by domestic discontent.
 Maybe something worse would take their place. Certainly there are authoritarian states -- Egypt, Saudi Arabia -- where the danger of an Islamist revolution should keep American policymakers awake at night. 
 But as an ideological rival to liberal democracy, Islamism isn't in the same league with the totalitarianisms of the 1930s. And there aren't any other likely candidates on the horizon. Indeed, for all the talk about a crisis of global capitalism, what's most striking about the great financial meltdown is how little radicalism it's spawned. 
 In the West, especially, there's been more hysteria about the specter of extremism than actual radical activity. If you listen to certain conservative media personalities, you'd think Obama is channeling Leon Trotsky. If you listen to certain liberal pundits, you'd think that talk radio was fomenting a wave of right-wing violence.
 But nothing of the sort is happening. Barack Obama is pushing the United States leftward, but his wish list -- universal health care, a green industrial policy -- has been pinned to the Democratic National Committee's bulletin board since the 1970s. Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly do not, in fact, command an army of gun-toting vigilantes, the crimes of a few lunatics notwithstanding. And in Europe, despite the angst over a few penny-ante racists getting themselves elected to the E.U. Parliament, the crisis's major beneficiaries have been the cautious, incrementalist parties of the center-right.
 In Iran, students are protesting for democracy and shouting for Obama. In the West, meanwhile, nobody's talking about adopting Putinist economic nationalism, or renovating the financial sector using the tenets of the Islamic banking system, or imitating Hugo Chavez's ''Bolivarian Socialism.'' (You'll sometimes hear admiring comments about China's recent economic management -- but never their one-party dictatorship.)
 Our current global economic crisis was created by Western-style democratic capitalism. But it hasn't turned into a crisis for democracy and capitalism, because nobody has a plausible alternative. 
 The appeal of authoritarianism, once upon a time, was based on the hope that it might deliver growth, prosperity, and happiness more efficiently than its liberal rivals. But nobody thinks that anymore -- not in Washington or London or Tokyo or Berlin, and not, on the evidence of this week's events, in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
 Which is why, if the West is fortunate, the current crisis could reverse the pattern of the Great Depression - by demonstrating the resilience of a global democratic order, and the weakness of its challengers.

HEADLINE: Climate Trap

 BODY:
Officials from the Obama administration have been beating a steady path to China's door to talk about climate change. 
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was there in February. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Congressional leaders visited last month, followed by experts from the Energy Department and the White House. There also has been regular contact at a series of ''major economies'' meetings that began during the Bush administration and include the 17 biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. 
 Without the enthusiastic participation of China -- and, of course, the United States -- negotiations in December in Copenhagen aimed at writing a new global agreement to replace the expiring 1997 Kyoto Protocol are almost sure to fail. The health of the planet is equally at stake. The United States is the largest per capita emitter of greenhouse gases; China is the biggest overall emitter. If they cannot agree on a common strategy, atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide are likely to reach potentially disastrous levels. 
 Ms. Pelosi found herself greatly encouraged by the dialogue but deeply afraid that the two countries would fall into an old trap: hiding behind each other so that neither would have to do anything difficult or expensive. 
 It's a legitimate fear. Even though the 1997 Kyoto Protocol was never submitted for ratification, senators from both parties made clear that they would never agree to any treaty that required the United States to cap its emissions without at the same time imposing similar limits on developing countries like China. 
 For their part, the Chinese have insisted -- and continue to insist -- that Washington move first and do more because, along with Europe, the United States bears responsibility for most of the increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases over the last 150 years. 
 This dance has to end. 
 True, there have been positive steps on both sides. President Obama has proposed tough new fuel-economy standards and authorized his Environmental Protection Agency to explore controls on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants and other industrial sources. China is investing heavily in carbon-free energy sources like wind and solar while trying to clean up its ubiquitous coal-fired power plants.
 Yet neither country has really committed to the kinds of reductions that are needed. A House committee bill that seeks a mandatory 80 percent cut in America's emissions by midcentury has barely begun its journey through Congress. The Chinese, meanwhile, are not even thinking about mandatory limits; they have said they will try to limit ''carbon intensity'' -- the amount of energy emitted per unit of gross domestic product -- which is another way of saying emissions will be allowed to rise.
 Washington's leverage over Beijing is not great. Its best option, by far, is to set a positive example: to press ahead with Mr. Obama's initiatives, to keep investing in cleaner technologies, to enact meaningful legislation. This may not be enough to get the Chinese to do what's necessary, but it will take away an important excuse.

HEADLINE: Obama Advances His Case; Health Bill's Cost Challenged

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama went before a convention of receptive but wary doctors on Monday to make the economic case for a health care overhaul, both for the nation and for the physicians' own bottom lines.
 But as the president spoke at the annual conference of the American Medical Association in Chicago, it became clear that one of the major health plans on the table would cost at least $1 trillion over 10 years yet leave tens of millions of people uninsured. 
 Congress is wrestling with how to pay for Mr. Obama's vision to extend health care to all Americans, and some lawmakers are considering tax increases and spending cuts different from the ones he has proposed. House Democrats, for example, are weighing a tax on soft drinks and a value-added tax, a broad-based consumption tax similar to the sales taxes many states levy.
 An analysis released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office raised the hurdles for draft legislation in the Senate just as its Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee planned to begin voting on Wednesday. The office concluded that a plan by the committee's Democratic leaders, Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, would reduce the number of uninsured only by a net 16 million people. Even if the bill became law, the budget office said, 36 million people would remain uninsured in 2017. 
 That finding came as a surprise. Robert D. Reischauer, an economist who headed the budget office when Congress tackled the health care issue in the Clinton administration, said that if so many people remained uninsured, it might not be feasible to cut special federal payments to hospitals that serve many low-income people.
 Mr. Obama said Saturday that the government could save $106 billion over 10 years by cutting such hospital payments as more people gained coverage.
 Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, a senior Republican on both committees drafting health legislation, said he found the office's numbers stunning. He calculated that the Kennedy bill would cost taxpayers $62,500 per uninsured person over the 10 years.
 Mr. Obama took the cost issue head on in Chicago. ''The cost of inaction is greater,'' he told the doctors, because rising health care prices are ''an escalating burden on our families and businesses'' and ''a ticking time bomb for the federal budget.''
 Opening a week in which health care will dominate attention in Congress, the president's speech on Monday was the latest example of an oft-used ploy to press his case: appearing before skeptical audiences, confident of his powers of persuasion but willing as well to say what his listeners do not want to hear.
 Mr. Obama spoke just days after the A.M.A. had signaled opposition to his proposal for a public health insurance plan to compete with private insurers as part of a menu of choices, much like the one for members of Congress. 
 ''The public option is not your enemy,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It is your friend, I believe.'' Saying it would ''keep the insurance companies honest,'' the president dismissed as ''illegitimate'' the claims of critics that a public insurance option amounts to ''a Trojan horse for a single-payer system'' run by the government.
 Mr. Obama twice referred to the use of such ''fear tactics'' about ''socialized medicine'' in past legislative battles, without pointing out that the A.M.A., a traditionally Republican-leaning group, was among those using the charge, as in the mid-1960s debate over creating Medicare for people 65 and older.
 Mr. Obama drew repeated applause, and even some standing ovations, when he called for incentives to get more medical students to go into primary care instead of the more lucrative specialty practices, and when he pledged to work with doctors to reduce their often unnecessary ''defensive medicine'' to avoid malpractice lawsuits. But scattered boos met his follow-up remark that he opposed any cap on malpractice awards.
 The president's emphasis on reducing health care costs over expanding insurance coverage, which dates to his campaign, reverses Democrats' priorities of recent years. Obama advisers say the focus on cost savings has appeal for all Americans, not just the uninsured. Some advisers, including veterans of the Clinton administration, say President Bill Clinton's emphasis on covering the uninsured helped doom his health care plan in 1994.
 ''We have made cost control a coequal objective, just as important as the expansion of insurance coverage, which has traditionally been the dominant goal for Democrats,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff. ''The entire discussion has to be centered on controlling or reducing costs.''
 That rationale has been Mr. Obama's answer to those who, after his election, predicted that he would have to shelve his campaign promise to overhaul health care to attend instead to an economy in crisis. ''If we fail to act, premiums will climb higher, benefits will erode further, the rolls of the uninsured will swell to include millions more Americans, all of which will affect your practice,'' he told the A.M.A. members.
 The practical problem for Mr. Obama is that by all accounts, the savings and efficiencies he envisions will not occur quickly, certainly not in the 10-year time frame of budget scorekeeping for purposes of passing legislation. 
 The budget office estimated that 39 million people would get coverage through new ''insurance exchanges.'' But at the same time, it said, the number of people with employer-provided health insurance would decline by 15 million, or about 10 percent, and coverage from other sources would fall by 8 million.
 In effect, the office said, millions of people would get a better deal if they bought insurance through an exchange because they could qualify for federal subsidies not available if they stayed in their employers' health plans. Subsidies are expected to average $5,000 to $6,000 a person.
 Mr. Obama assured skeptics in the audience: ''You did not enter this profession to be bean counters and paper pushers. You entered this profession to be healers. And that's what our health care system should let you be.''
 On Wednesday, leaders of the Senate Finance Committee hope to unveil what will be the one bipartisan measure in Congress. 
 Democrats on three House panels continue to meet privately to seek consensus on a single plan. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee said they were trying to decide whether to finance coverage of the uninsured with one broad-based tax, like the value-added tax, or a combination of smaller taxes.
 The value-added tax, common in other countries, is collected in stages from each business that contributes to the production and sale of consumer goods. Economists say a 5 percent VAT could have raised $285 billion last year.
 But a VAT could violate Mr. Obama's campaign pledge not to raise taxes on households with incomes under $250,000 a year.

HEADLINE: Fresher Food, With Some Help

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
Until a clean and airy ShopRite opened a year ago in Parkside, her low-income west Philadelphia neighborhood, Christine Gilliard used to pay someone to drive her several miles to the closest supermarket so she could avoid a long bus ride. Now she can walk to the new 69,700-square-foot store as often as she likes. 
 ''It's great, not just for me, but also for the elderly people,'' said Ms. Gilliard, who is 46. ''Who can carry $150 worth of groceries on the bus?''
 The ShopRite, which was bustling on a recent weekday, has a pharmacy, the type of produce department that suburban shoppers take for granted and special sections stocked with items like fufu flour, a staple of Jamaican cuisine, and red palm oil, a favorite of West African cooks. The halal meat counter was set up with advice from local imams. 
 Supermarkets are a low-margin business, generating profits of less than 2 percent, industry spokesmen say. The ShopRite owner, Jeffrey Brown, a fourth-generation grocer, said it would not have made economic sense to open the $14.5 million store, which is at 52nd Street and Parkside Avenue, if not for a Pennsylvania grant and revolving-loan program aimed at improving access to nutritious food in places with few, if any, good stores to choose from.
 ''In neighborhoods like this, people have less money and the first thing they cut out are all the high-margin items,'' said Mr. Brown, citing prepared foods and fancy breads as examples. Costs, like extra security, tend to be higher in poorer neighborhoods, he said.
 Through the Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Initiative, Mr. Brown, who owns 10 other supermarkets in the Philadelphia area, got a $1 million grant and $7 million in federal New Markets tax credits, which are aimed at stimulating investment in low-income communities. Several customers said the prices at Mr. Brown's store were fairer than what they had been used to.
 Inspired by Pennsylvania's example, New York City officials have developed an initiative of their own to bring new neighborhood markets selling fresh food to areas of the city where they say the need is greatest.
 Like Pennsylvania, New York will offer financial incentives, but the city is also proposing a series of zoning incentives for northern Manhattan, the South Bronx, Central Brooklyn and the Jamaica section of Queens. These include a density bonus that would allow developers to add 20,000 square feet to a residential building in exchange for putting a supermarket on the ground floor.
 ''When we spoke to operators, they said that in terms of challenges and hurdles, zoning changes would make an enormous difference to them,'' said Amanda M. Burden, the New York City planning commissioner. ''The level of enthusiasm was extremely strong.''
 The Pennsylvania program got started five years ago after the Food Trust, a Philadelphia nonprofit organization that was concerned about the high incidence of obesity and diabetes in neighborhoods where fresh food was scarce, began meeting with leaders of the supermarket industry. Another participant was the Reinvestment Fund, another nonprofit organization, which raises private capital from banks and investors for job-generating projects. The fund and the Food Trust teamed up.
 The program began with a $10 million allocation, which was renewed twice and matched with $90 million in private funds, for a total investment of $120 million, said Patricia L. Smith, the director of special initiatives for the Reinvestment Fund. 
 In all, the program has resulted in 69 projects in various stages of development, 23 of them in Philadelphia. Five approved projects have gone out of business, a relatively low failure rate, she said. Some 3,700 jobs have been created, said John Weidman, deputy director of the Food Trust. 
 Lucinda Hudson, who moved to Parkside in 1973, said she had waited more than three decades for a convenient way to buy fresh produce. Now she lives within shouting distance of Mr. Brown's market. ''I walk over there every day for my collard greens, my broccoli, my cabbage,'' said Ms. Hudson, the president of the Parkside Association of Philadelphia, a neighborhood group. ''When it opened, we had to pinch ourselves a couple of times.''
 Some of the Pennsylvania money has been used to upgrade small corner stores. Last year, Romano's Grocery, in the Juniata Park section of north Philadelphia, used a $150,000 grant from the state program, to pay part of the cost of installing new lighting and energy-efficient refrigeration equipment.
 Before the overhaul, said Juan Carlos Romano, the store owner, ''we had bananas and onions; that was about it.'' Now the store has a produce section, and Mr. Romano has experimented with different varieties of potato and squash to determine what his customers like. Business has increased by 40 percent, he said.
 In New York State, Gov. David A. Paterson has announced a ''Healthy Foods, Healthy Communities'' initiative, supported by a $10 million revolving loan fund. State officials plan to select a non-profit organization similar to Pennsylvania's Reinvestment Fund to administer the program and to leverage private dollars, said a spokeswoman, Erin Duggan. 
 New York City's initiative, called Fresh (the Food Retail Expansion to Support Health program), grew out of recommendations from a commission that included government officials and industry representatives.
 ''It was one of the first times that public officials were asking the right questions,'' said Patricia Brodhagen, a vice president of the Food Industry Alliance, a statewide association of retailers and wholesalers. ''The answer is simple: if supermarkets could make money, they would be there. Finally, we had somebody saying, 'What are the barriers?' '' 
 Under the city's program, supermarkets will be encouraged to apply for tax abatements and other financial incentives that have long been used by other businesses that generate jobs. The incentives can be used to build new stores or remodel existing ones. To qualify, a store must have at least 6,000 square feet of selling space and devote at least 30 percent of it to perishable items.
 In addition to the density bonus, the zoning proposals, which are subject to a lengthy review process, would free smaller supermarkets from having to supply parking spaces and would exempt stores in manufacturing zones of up to 30,000 square feet from the cumbersome land-use review process. (The current limit is 10,000 square feet.) 
 Some clashes seem inevitable. Operators of smaller markets that do not meet the city's fresh-food standards are likely to try to protect their stores. ''The city's notion of what is underserved may be different than the industry's,'' said Jack Zumba, a senior vice president of White Rose, a wholesaler that supplies 1,400 supermarkets in the New York area. Some of the supermarket chains would like to see the city expand the zoning exemption to include much larger stores, Ms. Brodhagen said.
 Union leaders say the city needs to do more to ensure that the program creates good jobs and does not threaten existing ones by introducing unfair competition. ''We don't need more minimum-wage jobs,'' said Pat Purcell, director of special projects for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1500.
 Will the incentives work in New York? One member of the supermarket commission, Alicia Glen, who heads the urban investment group at Goldman Sachs, praised the city's efforts but said that tax incentives and zoning bonuses alone were likely to have limited usefulness during an economic downturn. 
 ''For a good supermarket to operate successfully, you need big floor plates, you have to do a lot of volume, and you can't pay a lot of rent,'' she said. ''In the current environment, it's hard to put together a financially feasible deal without a significant amount of subsidy.''

HEADLINE: Election at a Draw, It's Cut the Deck in Arizona

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: CAVE CREEK, Ariz. 

 BODY:
Arizona is a modern place, among the fastest-growing states and home to Phoenix, the nation's fifth-largest city, with gleaming office towers and a just-opened light rail system.
 But now and then, the state's Western heritage comes storming through the saloon doors to remind one and all just what this place was like not so long ago.
 It happened here Monday in the shadow of the Phoenix sprawl, when it came to settling a draw in a local election. 
 Adam Trenk and Thomas McGuire, both in blue jeans and open-collar shirts, strode nervously into Town Hall with their posses. There stood the town judge. He selected a deck of cards from a Stetson hat and shuffled it -- having removed the jokers -- six times. 
 Mr. McGuire, 64, a retired science teacher and two-term incumbent on the Town Council, selected a card, the six of hearts, drawing approving oos and aws from his supporters. 
 Mr. Trenk, 25, a law student and newcomer to town, stepped forward. He lifted a card -- a king of hearts -- and the crowd roared. Cave Creek had finally selected its newest Council member.
 ''It's a hell of a way to win -- or lose -- an election,'' Mr. McGuire said. Still, it was only fitting, Mr. McGuire and others here said, that a town of 5,000 that prides itself on, and sometimes fights over, preserving its horse trails, ranches and other emblems of the Old West would cut cards to decide things. A transplant of 10 years from Yorktown Heights, N.Y., north of New York City, Mr. McGuire said he knew things were different here when not long after arriving he walked into a bar and found a horse inside.
 Marshall Trimble, a cowboy singer, folklorist and community college professor who serves as Arizona's official historian, said, ''We are pretty tied to our roots here, at least we like to think so.'' 
 In traditional balloting last month, the voters in Cave Creek could not decide between Mr. Trenk and Mr. McGuire the conventional way, giving each man, even after a recount, 660 votes in a runoff for a seat on the seven-member Council.
 So, as the state's Constitution allows, a game of chance was called to break the deadlock. The two candidates agreed on a card game (alternatives from the past have included rolling dice and, on rare occasions, gunfights).
 Mr. Trimble said a cutting of the cards or roll of the dice had decided ties a handful of times in Arizona local elections. Tie-breakers have also been tried in other states, including in recent years in Alaska and Minnesota, said Paul Fidalgo, a spokesman for FairVote, a Washington group that monitors and advocates for fair elections.
 Mr. Fidalgo said the group objected to random chance as the decider of election outcomes.
 ''Definitely not a democratic ideal, to say the least,'' he said, suggesting, among other ideas, that the tied candidates engage in one more runoff.
 That was ruled out here as too expensive, and besides, this was much more fun, as Mayor Vincent Francia made clear, clutching a microphone and serving as M.C. 
 ''Originally we thought of settling this with a paintball fight but that involves skill, and skill is not allowed in this,'' Mr. Francia said to laughter.
 He nodded to modern times, too, delaying the proceedings for several seconds so a local television station on commercial break could cover the ''historic occasion'' live.
 ''They are getting ready to shuffle!'' the reporter barked into his cellphone.
 But there was a serious undercurrent to the outcome as Cave Creek strives to maintain its character while looking for new sources of revenue in the recession.
 Mr. Trenk, who considered himself a fresh face in politics, wanted the seat badly enough to spend $17,000 on his campaign, unheard of in races here that normally require candidates to shell out several hundred dollars for a bunch of fliers.
 He said he had moved to Cave Creek last year from Scottsdale, an upscale suburb to the south, to keep a horse in his backyard and live the Western life he believes is threatened by unchecked development. He cast himself during the campaign as a preservationist.
 Mr. McGuire promoted his experience during hard economic times, when he believed it was needed most. He defended some development as necessary to keep the town afloat.
 A couple of hours after the tie-breaker, another crowd, larger and more impassioned, came to Town Hall to hear how the Council would decide on plans for a Wal-Mart.
 No card cutting was needed. The Council voted 6 to 1 to change the town's general plan, which guides growth, in a way that would allow for the store, and then 7 to 0 for the rezoning needed for the project.
 Mr. Trenk was that one objector and, in interviews before and after the vote, conceded he was ''on the fence'' over the project. He said that he found it hard to reconcile a big-box store with the town's horsy character, but ''I would be shooting the town in its foot'' to turn away the much-needed $3 million a year in tax revenue.
 ''You got to play the hand you're dealt,'' he said Tuesday. ''I learned that yesterday.''

SPOKES: THE PERILS
 And Annoyances
 Between Rides
 In a city of tight living quarters and unaccommodating corporate towers, the biggest cycling challenge can be storing one's ride. 
 For James Rather, an urban planner whose Riverdale walk-up does not have a storage option, lugging his bike up three flights to his apartment is a ''constant hassle,'' and sometimes dangerous.
 ''I use clipless pedals on my road bike,'' Mr. Rather, 28, wrote by e-mail, ''with the large cleats on the bottom that make you walk like a duck.''
 As he was going out for a ride recently, Mr. Rather slipped on the marble and clattered down a flight of stairs, his bike following him. (Despite a ''bruised forearm and a pretty sore lower back and rear end,'' he rode anyway.)
 He said that on-the-street parking, even if it weren't a risky option, is not available; of the 400 or so city bike racks in the Bronx, none are in Riverdale.
 Kendra Borowski, on the other hand, is lucky enough to have a closet outside her apartment in her NoLIta building.
 The only catch: Ms. Borowski, 30, has to haul her ride up seven flights to get it there.
 A survey by the Department of City Planning found that a lack of bike parking options at home and at work was a primary reason more people were not commuting by bike. Its solution: requiring new buildings to provide parking.
 ''You have to reach a certain critical mass for this to work, and we're there,'' said Amanda M. Burden, the city planning commissioner. 
 The new zoning requirements, adopted in April, include one bike space for every two residential units in buildings with more than 10 apartments, or for every 7,500 feet of commercial office space. In other words, if the Empire State Building had been built under the new rules, it would have around 350 bike spaces.
 On the other side of the commuting coin, City Councilman David Yassky has been trying to get office buildings to allow workers to take their bikes inside. His ''bikes in buildings'' bill had its second hearing on Monday, and Mr. Yassky is confident he has more than enough votes to get it passed ''in the next few weeks.''
 But secure bike storage does not guarantee a secure bike, as Gersh Kuntzman discovered when his bike was stolen from a Dumbo office building in March.
 ''The bike was locked to a specially provided bracket and chain on the wall!'' Mr. Kuntzman, the editor of The Brooklyn Paper, wrote in a column. ''Clearly, someone doesn't want me biking to work.''

HEADLINE: Espada's Switch Imperils Pro-Tenant Rent Law Changes

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
State Senator Pedro Espada, Jr. handed a significant victory to New York Republicans when he abandoned the Democratic caucus last Monday and threw the Senate back into Republican control. 
 Mr. Espada's surprise defection also delivered an all-but-unnoticed victory to another powerful group: New York's real estate industry.
 In the weeks before Mr. Espada bolted, Senate Democrats were poised to vote on the most significant expansion of rent regulation and tenant rights in a quarter-century, including legislation that could have cost the owners of the more than one million rent-stabilized apartments in New York City and its suburbs billions of dollars on their investments. 
 Mr. Espada, as chairman of the Senate Housing Committee, had assured Democratic leaders he would take up the bill, already passed by the Assembly, but repeatedly blocked it, citing technical objections and scheduling issues. Last Monday, after he defected to the Republicans and ascended to the Senate presidency, he announced he was opposed to the legislation.
 His move has all but assured that the bill will die this year. 
 ''It's dead,'' Michael McKee, a leading advocate for tenants, declared last week.
 Democrats said Mr. Espada's actions raise questions about whether he received financial support from real estate interests as he contemplated his switch of allegiance to the Republicans. As chairman of the Housing Committee, he would be expected to be a primary beneficiary of contributions from the industry, which is among the most powerful in Albany. 
 But he has refused to file financial disclosure statements required by state law, keeping all of his donations shrouded in secrecy. The industry's chief lobbyist declined on Tuesday to estimate how much members of his group, the Rent Stabilization Association, had given to Mr. Espada.
 The impact of the legislation's collapse could be far-reaching and comes as the recession has intensified tenants' fears of eviction while exposing real estate developers to severe financial strain, as loans dry up and public subsidies wither.
 Some developers in recent years attracted private equity funding as they paid premium prices to buy up thousands of rent-stabilized units with the intention of converting them to market-rate apartments. The new law would have sharply limited increases in those rents, costing some firms billions. 
 The bill's shelving underscores that last week's circus atmosphere in the Capitol is more than outrageous political theater -- it has consequences for many New Yorkers.
 ''Issues that have been waiting to be addressed have now been tanked by this political chaos,'' said Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a civic group.
 A key provision of the legislation would have abolished vacancy decontrol, a procedure that has allowed owners of rent-regulated apartments to move hundreds of thousands of units out of the rent-stabilization system, according to estimates by tenant advocates, and would have restored rent regulation to most of the apartments that have already been converted to market rents.
 Republicans, traditionally friendly to the real estate industry, have strongly opposed such measures.
 ''Clearly, chaos -- from our perspective -- is not such a bad thing,'' said Joseph Strasburg, the president of the Rent Stabilization Association, the main trade association for owners of rent-stabilized apartments. ''A lot of things are not going to get done.''
 If the Senate had remained under Democratic control, Mr. Espada would have been under enormous pressure from Senate Democratic leaders to support the bill. Malcolm A. Smith, the Democratic leader, had pledged to pro-tenant advocates and other allies the party depends on at campaign time that the Democrats would push the legislation through.
 Only three days remain in this year's legislative session, and tenant advocates believe there is little chance the bill will come up for a vote next year, either, since lawmakers will be up for re-election and reluctant to displease real estate donors. 
 Mr. Espada's Bronx Senate district has more regulated apartments than that of all but one other senator. In an interview, he said that the legislation, especially the provision that would have limited landlords' ability to remove units from rent regulation, would have hurt both renters and owners, especially during a downturn. 
 ''We lived through the 1970s in the Bronx,'' said Mr. Espada. ''If you take away the incentives to invest in these apartments, you are taking away jobs and contributing to the housing stock getting worse.''
 Landlord groups have carefully courted Mr. Espada, starting last fall after he defeated an incumbent Democratic senator but refused to pledge his support for Mr. Smith, leaving open the possibility of an alliance with Republicans. 
 Soon after the election, Mr. Strasburg arranged for Mr. Espada to have dinner with Dean G. Skelos, the Republican leader, in San Juan, P.R., where Mr. Espada was attending a conference with other lawmakers.
 Mr. Skelos did not succeed in his efforts to persuade Mr. Espada to join him at the time. Instead, Mr. Espada negotiated with Mr. Smith to become chairman of the Housing Committee. 
 Mr. Espada was represented in those talks with Mr. Smith by Stanley K. Schlein, an influential Bronx lawyer. When the Senate convened in January, according to state records, both the Rent Stabilization Association and the Real Estate Board of New York, a real estate trade group, hired Mr. Schlein as their lobbyist.
 In the months that followed, Mr. Espada pleased the landlords as he repeatedly delayed the vacancy decontrol legislation.
 Mr. Espada said that Mr. Smith had acted improperly in trying to force him to schedule a vote and now says that as president he will allow the bill's supporters a vote on the Senate floor. But tenant advocates had little faith that Mr. Espada will keep his word. They blamed Mr. Espada for the delays. ''It's been clear to us for weeks that Pedro's strategy has been to let the clock run out, and then say he ran out of time,'' Mr. McKee said.
 Mr. Espada declined to say precisely how much money he received from the landlords, but adamantly denied that it played any role in his defection. ''The money that Malcolm Smith got from landlords will far outweigh any contributions that I got,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Green Cards, Belief and Betrayal At a Storefront Church

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
Word of the deal spread swiftly among Ecuadorean immigrants, along a robust grapevine from New York City out to Long Island and into Westchester County. In Peekskill, N.Y., a gas station worker named Henry Leon heard about it through a friend of his wife's: The pastors of a storefront Pentecostal church in Corona, Queens, had the inside track on a special allotment of green cards the government had earmarked for church congregations.
 Mr. Leon and his wife made the two-hour trip by train and subway to Corona to meet with one of the two pastors, Gregorio Gonzalez. He told them that all they had to do was to fill out a form and provide $8,000 each in cash and some personal identification documents, Mr. Leon recalled. The green cards would be ready in a month. 
 It seemed too good to be true. And it was, according to prosecutors in the Queens district attorney's office. 
 Mr. Leon and his wife are among at least 120 illegal immigrants in the New York region, most of them Ecuadoreans, who the authorities say were defrauded out of a total of nearly $1 million by Mr. Gonzalez, 56, and two accomplices who were arrested in March and April. The authorities say it was one of the region's largest cases of immigration fraud in recent years.
 Mr. Leon, 26, a Roman Catholic, still finds it hard to believe that a man of the cloth would lie to them. ''For someone who talks so much about God,'' he said, ''why did he play people like that?'' 
 Immigration fraud has become widespread as hucksters, many of them newcomers themselves, take advantage of illegal immigrants desperate to legalize their status yet hesitant to seek help from law enforcement agencies for fear of deportation. Pastors accused of fleecing the faithful are nothing new, either: In April, a former minister of a church in Forest Hills, Queens, and four others were indicted on charges of swindling investors, many of them elderly or disabled church members, of more than $9 million.
 But the story of the Corona scheme suggests how especially insidious immigration fraud may be when practiced by leaders of a church -- the institution that many immigrants turn to for friendship and guidance in a foreign land.
 The Rev. Brian Jordan, a Franciscan priest based in Manhattan who has worked with immigrants and refugees for 26 years, said the victims in such cases are caught in ''double jeopardy.'' 
 ''The people are being scammed, and what makes it worse is they're being scammed by someone they trust, these so-called pastors,'' he said. Speaking of Mr. Gonzalez, he added, ''This guy is no more a pastor than I am an astronaut.''
 Immigrant advocates and law enforcement officials in New York and across the country say that immigration-fraud schemes operating out of religious institutions appear to be rare. But some may go unreported, given illegal immigrants' suspicions of the government and the transience of many small, independent churches. 
 Prosecutors say Mr. Gonzalez and Gerardo Bello, 21, set up their church, La Iglesia Roca de la Salvacion Eterna, in the cellar of a brick house in Corona early last year. The authorities said that it was unclear how large a congregation the men had built, but that neither was ordained.
 The services apparently took place in a large room where investigators said they found about 30 folding chairs and notebooks containing handwritten hymns. One immigrant who said she went to the church to confront Mr. Gonzalez said she arrived during a service and saw no more than seven people in attendance. 
 Mr. Gonzalez, officials said, is an Ecuadorean immigrant, too -- in the United States illegally and subject to deportation. He and Mr. Bello face charges of grand larceny, fraud and possession of stolen property. Mr. Gonzalez's sister, Maria Gonzalez, 52, is charged with grand larceny and possession of stolen property. Their lawyers did not respond to telephone messages. 
 The Rev. Christian Santiago of the Rock of Salvation Church, a venerable Pentecostal church in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., said Mr. Gonzalez began attending his services about two years ago.
 Soon afterward, Mr. Santiago recalled, Mr. Gonzalez started a Bible study group in Corona. But Mr. Santiago said he distanced himself from Mr. Gonzalez when he noticed that the other man was showing ''more interest in money than in spiritual things.'' 
 In interviews, 10 immigrants from five families said they learned about the Corona pastors' offer in the spring of 2008. Several agreed to speak only if their last names were not published, for fear that the defendants or their relatives might seek revenge.
 Many were not members of the church, but say they had heard about the pastors' offer from relatives and friends. Maria, 47, an unemployed Ecuadorean living in Corona, said she got word from her daughter, who was told by a friend whose uncle was getting involved. 
 ''We were so excited that we didn't really consider the consequences,'' Maria said, adding that she and seven family members each paid Mr. Gonzalez $9,000.
 Mr. Gonzalez, the immigrants said, told them versions of the same story: that the federal government was holding a special lottery for 12,000 green cards earmarked for churches around the country. But time was short, he warned, and they would have to pay him a fee in cash, ranging from $6,000 to $10,000.
 ''It seemed so strange that it was so easy, but he convinced us,'' recalled Viviana, 27, who lives with her husband and two children in Astoria, Queens. ''We were foolish.'' 
 She and her husband, an auto mechanic, paid Mr. Gonzalez $16,000, she said, draining their savings and borrowing money from her mother in Ecuador. Others borrowed from friends or colleagues, most at high rates of interest. 
 But a month came and went, the immigrants said, and no green cards appeared. When they pressed Mr. Gonzalez, they said, he told them the process would take another few weeks. He had scheduled interviews for them at a federal immigration office, they said, and gave them dates. 
 As those dates approached, the pastor said there had been more delays, owing in part to the coming presidential transition. He rescheduled the appointments, they said, and those, too, fell through.
 Mr. Gonzalez used the language of piety to appeal for patience and tamp down their suspicions, the immigrants said. ''He always said: 'Have faith. Where is your faith?' '' recalled Margarita, 51, a devout Catholic who said she and nine other family members paid Mr. Gonzalez a total of $80,000.
 But as the months wore on, and some people began to demand their money back, Mr. Gonzalez's language turned sinister, the immigrants said: he threatened to call the authorities and have them deported. Several months ago, they said, Mr. Gonzalez stopped answering their phone calls and closed the church. 
 Maria and her family were among the first to notify the district attorney's office. Another group of immigrants was referred there by Father Jordan. Soon, prosecutors say, they were deluged with calls.
 Many of the immigrants say they find themselves in deep financial holes at a time when work is scarce. Officials can offer only limited hope: Full restitution for victims is often difficult in cases of economic fraud, especially in immigration-related cases, which almost always involve cash transactions.
 But the hurt, witnesses said, has gone far deeper than the financial loss.
 ''We're simple people,'' said Margarita, tears spilling from her eyes. ''They gave us the word of God.''

HEADLINE: Iran's Latest Protests Seen As the Toughest to Stop

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
In an iconic photograph of antigovernment demonstrations in Iran, a student with flowing black hair and a headband held aloft the bloody T-shirt of a wounded protester. After his face appeared on the cover of The Economist magazine in July 1999, Ahmad Batebi paid dearly for it, enduring nearly a decade of imprisonment and torture before fleeing into exile. 
 On Tuesday, as he watched the swelling antigovernment protests in Iran from suburban Virginia, Mr. Batebi described a sense of dread mixing with happiness. ''Every society has to make their own version of freedom and democracy, and that is what the Iranian people are doing right now,'' he said through a translator. ''But I know that people are being beaten, some are going to jail and some will be killed.'' 
 The Iranian government tolerated student-led uprisings in 1999 and 2003 for only a few days before unleashing fearsome crackdowns, sending Basij vigilantes onto campuses, where they flung a few students from the windows; bloodied as many heads as they could with bricks, chains or truncheons; and jailed scores. 
 Similar intimidation tactics have been on display over the past few days with little result, as Iranian state news reports of seven people killed in various cities did not deter another major antigovernment rally on Tuesday. This time, analysts say, the government will have trouble bringing about a swift, sharp end to the demonstrations over the contested presidential election results in the same way it had shut down previous eruptions. 
 First, there is the sheer size of these demonstrations, with protests that are not limited to students, but cut across generations and economic classes. Second, there is a more pronounced, if still nebulous, leadership centered around the leading opposition candidate, Mir Hussein Moussavi, who has adopted an openly hard-edged attitude toward the government. Third, the current crisis was inspired by common anger over a national election, not the more narrow issues students took to heart. 
 The question mark remains how long Iran's rulers will tolerate the demonstrations, and indeed how long the protesters will stay in the streets until what many analysts expect will be a ''Tiananmen moment.'' They fear a replay of the Chinese government's rolling out tanks to ruthlessly crush pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989 -- China's economic growth and centralized control being something of a model for the mullahs. 
 ''This is an order of magnitude different from those earlier demonstrations,'' said Juan Cole, a professor of Middle East history at the University of Michigan, who has been tracking the upheaval on his Informed Comment blog. ''In the earlier student demonstrations, people were saying that the hard-liners were doing things that were wrong. What these demonstrators are saying is that the regime has become so corrupt and so dictatorial that it has become rotten to the core.'' 
 In the earlier protests, the middle class extended something like drive-by support, honking their horns or flashing their high-beam headlights as they drove past the chanting students. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, spoke like a rueful patriarch, saying he regretted the few student deaths and that people who criticized him should not be chastised. After the initial spasms of violence the president at the time, Mohammad Khatami, fearing wider bloodshed, declined to call his followers out in support. 
 The general sentiment was that everyone should go home and try to solve problems through the ballot box, noted Ervand Abrahamian, an expert on Iranian opposition movements at Baruch College. But the chance of that kind of compromise has been soured by the sentiment that Friday's election was stolen. 
 ''Those arguments don't work now because the ballot box has proved to be a cul-de-sac,'' said Mr. Abrahamian. 
 Mr. Moussavi was a staunch leftist in an era when such leaders admired Che Guevara, and he served as prime minister of Iran during the 1980s when postrevolutionary battles with guerrilla movements left between 10,000 and 20,000 people dead, noted Professor Cole. He is viewed as a much tougher fighter than Mr. Khatami, an ayatollah who came from the very clerical class that runs the country.
 ''Moussavi was around in some tough times, he has not shown any signs of being intimidated by all this,'' said Gary Sick, a senior scholar at Columbia University who runs the Persian Gulf research and information Web site called Gulf 2000. Just how far Mr. Moussavi takes the mantle of leadership is another unanswered question -- the demonstrations will have to continue for the demands for change to yield results, he said.
 Finally, there has been a critical shift in alliances. In the earlier uprisings, it was basically the reformists calling for change, opposed by both the religious hard-liners and the more pragmatic conservatives. This time, the pragmatists and the reformists have joined forces against the hard-liners, analysts said. 
 With that, the route to any workable compromise over demands by demonstrators for a new election is difficult to envision, analysts said. One reason Mr. Moussavi and other leaders have labored to keep the chants focused on the election result is to avoid giving the government the excuse to open fire because the demonstrators want to topple the system. 
 ''I expect the situation to polarize further, and given the character of this regime, I think it is a matter of time before they roll in the tanks,'' said Professor Cole.

HEADLINE: Investors, Mindful of Negative Numbers, Sell Holdings

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY; David Jolly and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It was another tough day for the optimists and bulls on Wall Street.
 Investors continued to sell off stocks on Tuesday, as commodity prices fell and new economic data dashed hopes for an imminent rebound. New figures showing a 1.1 percent decline in industrial production reinforced that view, and blunted the impact of other, more positive economic numbers.
 ''You have a one-two punch that works against the market,'' said David Kovacs, chief investment officer of quantitative strategies at Turner Investments. ''Between consumer stocks selling off and commodities selling, you have a fairly broad, weak market.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 107.46 points, or 1.25 percent, to 8,504.67, while the broader Standard & Poor's declined 1.27 percent, or 11.75 points, at 911.97. The day's losses added to a broad 2 percent decline on Monday.
 The Nasdaq was down 1.11 percent, or 20.20 points, at 1,796.18. 
 Companies that produce basic materials like plastic and metals led the markets lower on Tuesday as investors speculated that commodity prices had flown too high. Crude oil prices reversed their gains to close down 15 cents, at $70.47 a barrel in New York trading. 
 Consumer stocks sank as Best Buy reported that its profit declined 15 percent during its fiscal first quarter, raising broader concerns about how consumer spending will hold up if job losses continue to mount this year. Best Buy fell 7.3 percent, and retailers like J. Crew, RadioShack and Macy's lost ground. Investors will get more information on changes in retail prices and inflationary pressures on Wednesday, when the government releases the Consumer Price Index for May.
 Some analysts are concerned that retail spending may come under pressure from higher gasoline prices and rising mortgage rates -- in addition to job losses and falling wages. Gasoline prices were an average $2.67 a gallon on Tuesday, up from $2.31 a month ago, according to AAA's Fuel Gauge Report.
 ''The market is once again getting scared that the excess money the consumer had picked up, all of a sudden that looks like it's walking out the door a touch,'' said Blaze Tankersley, chief market strategist at Bay Crest Partners. ''All of a sudden the consumer situation is looking like what it was when stocks were going down.'' 
 Home builders were among the few who eked out gains on Tuesday, rising on the government's latest report on new-home construction. Shares of big builders like D.R. Horton, Centex and Lennar rose moderately after the Commerce Department said that housing starts had risen 17.2 percent in May from a month earlier.
 The increase came a month after housing starts dropped sharply, largely because of a deep decline in construction of multifamily homes. Those numbers recovered slightly in May, and construction of single-family homes increased for a third consecutive month. 
 ''We're looking for this bottom that seems to be out there, close by,'' said David Crowe, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. 
 The government also said that prices received by producers for finished goods rose a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in May, hinting that Wall Street's fears of inflation may be exaggerated. Still, energy prices rose the most since January, with gasoline prices up nearly 14 percent for the month.
 In a third report, the Federal Reserve said that industrial production fell 1.1 percent in May, more than expected. 
 The dollar slid against the euro, yen and other major currencies as leaders from Brazil, China, India and Russia met at a financial summit meeting. Some traders have worried that emerging economies like China, Russia and others will reduce their investments in American bonds, weakening the dollar and hobbling its status as the world's reserve currency.
 But investors wary of more declines in stock markets and dismal economic figures showed a renewed interest in government debt, traditionally a haven during recessions. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 14/32 to 95 19/32 while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, fell to 3.66 percent, from 3.71 percent on Monday. 
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Limits In a System That's Sick

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Rationing.
 More to the point: Rationing!
 As in: Wait, are you talking about rationing medical care? Access to medical care is a fundamental right. And rationing sounds like something out of the Soviet Union. Or at least Canada.
 The r-word has become a rejoinder to anyone who says that this country must reduce its runaway health spending, especially anyone who favors cutting back on treatments that don't have scientific evidence behind them. You can expect to hear a lot more about rationing as health care becomes the dominant issue in Washington this summer. 
 Today, I want to try to explain why the case against rationing isn't really a substantive argument. It's a clever set of buzzwords that tries to hide the fact that societies must make choices. 
 In truth, rationing is an inescapable part of economic life. It is the process of allocating scarce resources. Even in the United States, the richest society in human history, we are constantly rationing. We ration spots in good public high schools. We ration lakefront homes. We ration the best cuts of steak and wild-caught salmon. 
 Health care, I realize, seems as if it should be different. But it isn't. Already, we cannot afford every form of medical care that we might like. So we ration. 
 We spend billions of dollars on operations, tests and drugs that haven't been proved to make people healthier. Yet we have not spent the money to install computerized medical records -- and we suffer more medical errors than many other countries. 
 We underpay primary care doctors, relative to specialists, and they keep us stewing in waiting rooms while they try to see as many patients as possible. We don't reimburse different specialists for time spent collaborating with one another, and many hard-to-diagnose conditions go untreated. We don't pay nurses to counsel people on how to improve their diets or remember to take their pills, and manageable cases of diabetes and heart disease become fatal. 
 ''Just because there isn't some government agency specifically telling you which treatments you can have based on cost-effectiveness,'' as Dr. Mark McClellan, head of Medicare in the Bush administration, says, ''that doesn't mean you aren't getting some treatments.'' 
 Milton Friedman's beloved line is a good way to frame the issue: There is no such thing as a free lunch. The choice isn't between rationing and not rationing. It's between rationing well and rationing badly. Given that the United States devotes far more of its economy to health care than other rich countries, and gets worse results by many measures, it's hard to argue that we are now rationing very rationally.
 On Wednesday, a bipartisan panel led by four former Senate majority leaders -- Howard Baker, Tom Daschle, Bob Dole and George Mitchell -- will release a solid proposal for health care reform. Among other things, it would call on the federal government to do more research on which treatments actually work. An ''independent health care council'' would also be established, charged with helping the government avoid unnecessary health costs. The Obama administration supports a similar approach. 
 And connecting the dots is easy enough. Armed with better information, Medicare could pay more for effective treatments -- and no longer pay quite so much for health care that doesn't make people healthier.
 Mr. Baker, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dole and Mr. Mitchell: I accuse you of rationing. 
 There are three main ways that the health care system already imposes rationing on us. The first is the most counterintuitive, because it doesn't involve denying medical care. It involves denying just about everything else.
 The rapid rise in medical costs has put many employers in a tough spot. They have had to pay much higher insurance premiums, which have increased their labor costs. To make up for these increases, many have given meager pay raises. 
 This tradeoff is often explicit during contract negotiations between a company and a labor union. For nonunionized workers, the tradeoff tends to be invisible. It happens behind closed doors in the human resources department. But it still happens.
 Research by Katherine Baicker and Amitabh Chandra of Harvard has found that, on average, a 10 percent increase in health premiums leads to a 2.3 percent decline in inflation-adjusted pay. Victor Fuchs, a Stanford economist, and Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist now in the Obama administration, published an article in The Journal of the American Medical Association last year that nicely captured the tradeoff. When health costs have grown fastest over the last two decades, they wrote, wages have grown slowest, and vice versa.
 So when middle-class families complain about being stretched thin, they're really complaining about rationing. Our expensive, inefficient health care system is eating up money that could otherwise pay for a mortgage, a car, a vacation or college tuition. 
 The second kind of rationing involves the uninsured. The high cost of care means that some employers can't afford to offer health insurance and still pay a competitive wage. Those high costs mean that individuals can't buy insurance on their own.
 The uninsured still receive some health care, obviously. But they get less care, and worse care, than they need. The Institute of Medicine has estimated that 18,000 people died in 2000 because they lacked insurance. By 2006, the number had risen to 22,000, according to the Urban Institute. 
 The final form of rationing is the one I described near the beginning of this column: the failure to provide certain types of care, even to people with health insurance. Doctors are generally not paid to do the blocking and tackling of medicine: collaboration, probing conversations with patients, small steps that avoid medical errors. Many doctors still do such things, out of professional pride. But the full medical system doesn't do nearly enough. 
 That's rationing -- and it has real consequences. 
 In Australia, 81 percent of primary care doctors have set up a way for their patients to get after-hours care, according to the Commonwealth Fund. In the United States, only 40 percent have. Over all, the survival rates for many diseases in this country are no better than they are in countries that spend far less on health care. People here are less likely to have long-term survival after colorectal cancer, childhood leukemia or a kidney transplant than they are in Canada -- that bastion of rationing.
 None of this means that reducing health costs will be easy. The comparative-effectiveness research favored by the former Senate majority leaders and the White House has inspired opposition from some doctors, members of Congress and patient groups. Certainly, the critics are right to demand that the research be done carefully. It should examine different forms of a disease and, ideally, various subpopulations who have the disease. Just as important, scientists -- not political appointees or Congress -- should be in charge of the research. 
 But flat-out opposition to comparative effectiveness is, in the end, opposition to making good choices. And all the noise about rationing is not really a courageous stand against less medical care. It's a utopian stand against better medical care.

HEADLINE: A Small Vineyard Helps to Put Long Island on the Map

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

DATELINE: MATTITUCK, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 THE history of grape growing and winemaking out here on the North Fork of Long Island reaches back just a few decades, a mere sliver of a moment in viticultural time.
 Even so, Shinn Estate Vineyards is a newcomer. Its first vines were planted here in 2000 on the old Tuthill Farm, less than a mile from the Long Island Sound. The first wines came with the 2002 vintage. Neither Barbara Shinn nor David Page, the proprietors of Shinn, had ever grown grapes or made wine before, but their wines, made with the help of several North Fork winemakers, were good right away. 
 With their 2002 merlot, which I first tasted in 2005, I was hooked. The 2003 was even better, and the 2005 better yet, balanced with an aroma of violets and an earthy flavor of plums and minerals. 
 These were not profound wines meant to tax the analytic vocabulary and the bank account. They were simply delicious, the sort of wines I'd be delighted to open for dinner at any time. In a sense they represent the rising potential of a wine region that is still debating whether its land is best suited to merlot, cabernet franc, sauvignon blanc or myriad other grapes like albarino or carmenere. 
 Nobody would ever mistake the North Fork for Napa Valley. It's too quiet, for one thing, and it has yet to set itself up consciously as a tourist destination. The sign at the end of Elijah's Lane directing visitors left on Oregon Road to Shinn Estate is hand-scrawled on a slab of wood, its post sunk into a tub of cement to discourage souvenir hunters. Since the beginning of June, it's been raining out here more often than not, unheard of in sunny St. Helena.
 When Ms. Shinn, an artist, and Mr. Page, a chef, first came out to the North Fork in 1990, what they saw depressed them. The land was flat and scrubby. Farms looked worn out. The agricultural economy seemed at an end and the region looked ripe for development, with a future of subdivisions and perhaps Hamptons-style boutiques and homes for the well-off.
 To Ms. Shinn and Mr. Page, would-be restaurateurs back then who were contemplating a move to New York from California, this was not a good thing. But Mr. Page's fears soon evaporated.
 ''We saw some wineries, and then we met some passionate young people who were trying to change the landscape,'' he said. ''And it's happened.''
 Nearly 20 years later the North Fork's reputation as a source for fine wine and fine food is growing. Wineries have stayed the course, bit by bit sorting out the intricacies of North Fork viticulture, while farmers have come to realize that their future may not reside in volume but in top-quality produce. Slowly, small restaurants and inns have opened, providing a showcase for North Fork cuisine.
 When Ms. Shinn and Mr. Page moved to New York, eventually to open Home restaurant in Greenwich Village in 1993 and to marry in 1996, they missed the local cuisine that had been developing in Northern California since the 1970's, particularly the sense of community among like-minded chefs, farmers, wine producers and livestock growers. 
 Since 2000 they have been doing their utmost to recreate that sense of local cuisine they left behind in California. For a while they commuted between New York and Mattituck, using local produce and serving local wines at Home, but eventually it became too much. In 2004 they settled on the North Fork full time. In 2007 they sold their interest in Home and moved into a renovated farmhouse adjacent to the vineyard, where they also operate a small bed and breakfast.
 ''It takes the food of a place plus the wine of a place to build a cuisine of a place,'' Mr. Page said. ''The North Fork of Long Island is getting really close to having arrived.''
 Part of that arrival, the couple believes, is the ability to farm sustainably, without chemicals that can damage health and the environment. But that is difficult on the North Fork, where the damp promotes mold and mildew, which are hard to treat without chemicals. In fact, more than a few Long Island winemakers will tell you that farming organically is not possible. Ms. Shinn and Mr. Page reject that belief, though they acknowledge the difficulty.
 ''We're not there yet,'' Ms. Shinn said. ''We don't know yet how to contend with specific diseases, like downy mildew and black rot. It's a problem when it rains in the spring.''
 Nonetheless, she has nurtured the vineyard, now 20 acres of gravelly soil, with a system built on no tilling and no herbicides. With cover crops of purslane, clover and plantain weeds, the vineyard floor now looks like a meadow. ''Just call it biodiversity instead of weeds and you're good to go,'' Mr. Page said.
 The plants (Ms. Shinn estimates at least 60 species on the vineyard floor) attract bugs, good bugs, that prey on vineyard nuisances. She uses the drip-irrigation system in the vineyard not so much to irrigate the vines but to spread compost, which she brews into a sort of tea. The idea is to keep the soil alive and not to threaten the natural biodiversity of the vineyard.
 Since 2006, Shinn's first vintage in its own winery, in a restored barn next to the farmhouse, Mr. Page and the winemaker, Anthony Nappa, have worked out a regimen of slow fermentations and long macerations of up to 50 days for their estate reds.
 Shinn Estate now makes 13 wines, some in extremely small quantities, including a dry, tangy sparkling wine made, like several of the whites, from purchased fruit. The 2008 Coalescence is noteworthy -- a fresh white blend that sells for about $15 a bottle. 
 By all accounts, the 2007 vintage was wonderful on eastern Long Island. Unlike in California, where the problem is often slowing the pace of ripening, on Long Island the issue is getting the grapes to ripen enough. That was not a problem in the long '07 growing season. Nonetheless, the Shinn reds are balanced and almost delicate. The 2007 cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon are lovely, elegant wines while the signature estate merlot is deep and dense, yet light-bodied. And the '08 vintage? It was much more typical -- that is, more challenging.
 ''That's a great thing about being here,'' Mr. Page said. ''Vintage? We have it.''

HEADLINE: Some Transit Aid May Be Freed Up for Operating Costs

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
For some public transit systems, the federal stimulus program seemed like an O. Henry gift. Washington sent them billions of dollars for new equipment and construction, but nothing to operate the systems they have, even as many are cutting service or raising fares. 
 Now Congress may be providing some relief. A provision tucked inside the latest war spending bill would allow transit agencies to spend up to 10 percent of their stimulus money on operating expenses. 
 ''It's really welcome news for us,'' said Adella Jones, the vice president for government affairs at the St. Louis transit agency, Metro, which instituted some of the deepest transit cuts in the country earlier this year when it suspended service to 2,300 bus stops, laid off 450 workers and left many commuters in the region struggling to find new ways to get to work. 
 Ms. Jones said the provision would free up $4.5 million, adding to $12 million in aid that the State Legislature recently approved to reverse about a third of the cuts.
 Transit ridership broke modern records last year, but many systems around the country are now struggling to make ends meet. Fares pay between only a fifth and a half of the cost of a ride on most systems, and the dismal economy has shrunk the tax collections that many systems rely on to keep their trains and buses running.
 A survey last month of 98 transit agencies, conducted by the American Public Transportation Association, an industry group, found that three-quarters had either raised fares or cut service in the last year.
 Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, pushed for the provision. 
 ''This provision will ensure that elderly residents, commuters and families are not left without the transit services they rely on every day,'' Ms. Murray said in a statement. ''It will also protect jobs, which is the focus of the Recovery Act.'' 
 But the change, if approved, will come after many transit agencies have already planned their budgets for the coming fiscal year.
 Several agencies said they did not plan to use the money for operating expenses. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is planning to eliminate more than 300 positions and reduce some bus service to balance its budget; it plans to use its stimulus money to fix platforms, repair tracks and buy hybrid buses. 
 In California, the Bay Area Rapid Transit system is planning to raise fares and cut service, but does not plan to use the stimulus money for operations, a spokeswoman said. 
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York, which recently raised fares by 10 percent but avoided deep service cuts after the state agreed to help it with new taxes and fees, said it would review the option with its board if the provision was included in the final bill.
 Others welcomed the flexibility. Lynne Griffith, the chief executive officer of Pierce Transit, in Washington, said in a statement that the stimulus money would allow her to retain service and save jobs despite a $10 million decline in revenue.

HEADLINE: Racing to Abide by In-Office Surgery Law in New York

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
A New York State law that takes effect on July 14 has physicians who perform office-based surgery scrambling to upgrade their offices or find new space altogether.
 The legislation, called the Patient Protection Bill and signed into law by Gov. Eliot Spitzer in July 2007, is intended to ensure high safety standards in offices when surgery and other invasive procedures are conducted with more than minimal sedation.
 It is the first time that New York State will regulate office-based surgeries. Doctors doing surgery will be required to have their offices accredited by one of three existing agencies by July 14, or face penalties for professional misconduct if they continue to perform operations. 
 Depending on their specialty, doctors may find that under the new law they need larger elevators, improved ventilation, backup power equipment with the ability to run for a longer period and other mechanical accommodations.
 Since some medical offices cannot be physically adapted to meet accreditation requirements, especially in Manhattan, many physicians have been seeking new office space, said Paul Wexler, the president of Corcoran Wexler Healthcare Properties, a real estate brokerage firm specializing in medical office space.
 ''There are a wide variety of specialists who do their procedures in their offices, and over the last number of months, we've seen a significant rise, perhaps a 50 percent increase, in the number of physicians who have looked for new facilities,'' Mr. Wexler said.
 One such physician is Ramtin Kassir, a plastic surgeon whose practice, New York Park Avenue Surgery P.C., has moved into 799 Park Avenue, at 74th Street. Dr. Kassir had previously rented unaccredited office space in Manhattan, but was lucky enough to find a medical office that had already been accredited by the previous plastic surgeon, so he decided to purchase it.
 ''The reason I bought, despite a bad economy, instead of leasing again, was this place was accredited,'' Dr. Kassir said.
 Many Manhattan doctors' offices are on the first floors of co-op apartment buildings, and some of these offer little hope of meeting the new standards.
 ''A number of these offices are in prewar buildings that could never be upgraded to meet the requirements,'' Mr. Wexler said. ''If you envision an office on the corner of your typical apartment building, you can't all of a sudden stick a vent in the window that goes out into the street.''
 Mr. Wexler said the new law may be causing more disruption for doctors in New York City than for physicians in the suburbs. In urban settings, especially in Manhattan, elective office-based procedures are popular, but buildings may be harder to upgrade.
 Claire Pospisil, a spokeswoman with the New York State Department of Health, said the state did not know how many medical offices were conducting operations; this was one reason for the new law.
 ''It will help us determine that number,'' Ms. Pospisil said. ''Our guesstimate has been about 3,000 medical offices in the state do these, but we really don't know. And we would estimate that approximately 70 or 75 percent of medical offices in New York City and Long Island do these surgeries.''
 Mr. Wexler said that some doctors who have not been able to find new space easily in Manhattan would, on a temporary basis, be using hospitals or surgery centers to perform their procedures.
 But there are few surgery centers in Manhattan. One is the Center for Specialty Care Inc., at 50 East 69th Street between Park and Madison Avenues. It is a 15,000-square-foot mansion built in 1914 and converted in the mid-1980s to medical offices, waiting rooms, five operating rooms and a recovery area. It has been licensed by the state since 1988 to operate as a surgery center.
 Marcia F. Gowen, the center's marketing consultant and tenant coordinator, said that the center, which has about 130 credentialed physicians, typically awarded new credentials to about three doctors a month.
 ''We credentialed three just last week,'' she said in early June. ''And I would say I have an increased volume of doctors coming in. We definitely feel the drumbeat of new legislation.''
 The handful of private companies that develop medical office space in Manhattan have been acutely aware of the details of the pending law. Lee Moncho, who is developing a 15,000-square-foot building with medical offices for lease at 261 East 78th Street, between Second and Third Avenues, said that, for instance, besides two large elevators, the landings on the stairs serving the building's seven levels have been extended to fit patient gurneys.
 Mr. Moncho said the extra cost of outfitting the medical building to meet the law's standards ''wasn't minor, but it was livable.'' Rents will start at $5,000 a month, ranging up to $20,000 a month, depending on customization.
 ''What's a nightmare is if you don't do it, and then have to upgrade it'' after the initial construction has been completed, he said.
 Mr. Wexler said a big problem facing doctors in Manhattan was a dearth of recently built medical office space. Apart from 261 East 78th Street and one other building under construction on the Upper East Side, he could think of no others built by private developers in the last two decades.
 ''Other than hospitals building medical offices themselves, as far as private development of this type of product, it has not really existed in Manhattan,'' he said.
 Maria Veltre, an executive vice president with Citibank's small-business group, agreed, saying that credit was available for doctors who wanted to buy space in a medical building but that few medical condominiums existed.
 ''A decent number of our health care clients are looking for new space to take advantage of the favorable rate environment that's out there, but that's countered with difficulty in finding the right space, especially in New York City,'' Ms. Veltre said. 
 She added: ''For people looking to either develop or sell real estate, this is a primary audience that you want to be able to serve because they are incredibly creditworthy.''

HEADLINE: A Historic Scottish Castle Becomes a Home

BYLINE: By ABIGAIL SALTMARSH

 BODY:
KINGSTON, Scotland
 As young boys they played in the ruins of a 16th-century tower, high up on a hill in the Scottish countryside, and dreamed of restoring it to its former glory. 
 More than 40 years later, John Macaskill, a banker now based in New York, and Ian Simpson, a Scottish farmer, have rebuilt Fenton Tower as a holiday home for Mr. Macaskill's family or as many as 12 paying guests. 
 The five-story stone structure stands on the Simpson family land, called Sydserf Farm, about 20 miles outside Edinburgh. ''I think at the age of 14 or 15 we thought it would make the most wonderful bachelor pad,'' said Mr. Macaskill, 59, who was born in Edinburgh and spent summers helping on the farm. ''But the more time we spent there, and as we grew up, we realized what an excellent location it was. There has been a fortified tower on the site since the 11th century because there are uninterrupted views in every direction.'' 
 The six-bedroom tower was rebuilt from the remains of a square keep constructed about 1550; one of its earliest owners was Sir John Carmichael, who was responsible for policing the borders between Scotland and England. It was all but destroyed by Oliver Cromwell and his army in 1620 and remained derelict until renovations began at the 20-acre site in 2000.
 ''I had rebuilt a home in New York and was in the process of building a house in Colorado,'' said Mr. Macaskill, a managing director with Groton Merchant Bankers. ''I was dealing with the building industry and had an understanding of some of the processes. As a farmer, Ian was also used to building -- so we began to think in 1998 it might not be so daunting to rebuild the tower.''
 The ruins were listed as one of Scotland's ancient monuments, so Nicholas Groves-Raines, an Edinburgh architect who specializes in conservation and restoration work, was appointed to oversee the project. Historic Scotland, a government agency charged with safeguarding the nation's historic buildings, also was involved.
 Work began in 2000 and took two years to complete. A nearby quarry, the source of the sandstone used in the original construction, was reopened for the project, and some stone that had been taken from the ruins to build a farm wall was reclaimed.
 Mr. Groves-Raines has restored several tower houses, as the structures are commonly called in Scotland. He is passionate about the style of architecture and had known about these particular ruins since the 1950s. 
 ''It was wonderful for me to work on this, as these towers are such an interest of mine,'' he said. ''But there was quite a lot to decipher before we could get started. We had to work out what had been there and then adapt it to suit modern needs. But I was very pleased they wanted to put it back as it was and not just stick a glass box onto the side of the ruins.''
 Mr. Simpson, 58, said that he and Mr. Macaskill wanted to rebuild the tower accurately. ''We even had the small amount of the pink render that was left analyzed so we could recreate it exactly,'' he said, referring to the original decorative finish on the tower's facade. 
 Another challenge was figuring out a way to add electricity and plumbing without damaging or disfiguring the building. ''At the time I was putting radiant heating into my home in Colorado. We decided to try it in the tower and it works phenomenally well there, especially as the thick stone walls keep the heat in,'' Mr. Macaskill said.
 The restoration cost about $:2 million (almost $3.2 million), part of which was paid with a grant of $:271,100 ($433,300) from Historic Scotland.
 The men say Fenton Tower is not for sale. And Malcolm Leslie of the East Lothian branch of Savills real estate agency said it would be hard to put a value on such an unusual property, especially in the current economic downturn. 
 In 2007, his company sold Seton Castle, a classic tower house designed by the renowned Scottish architect Robert Adam, for more than $:4 million ($6.4 million).
 ''The market here has dropped by about 15 percent since then and, as a result, we are not seeing much of this special property coming to the market at the moment. People are waiting to see what happens,'' Mr. Leslie said. ''Having said that, we are seeing some foreign buyers slowly coming back because of the currency swing.'' 
 Fenton Tower still has its original 1,482-square-foot footprint but it now contains more than 7,000 square feet of living space. The lower ground floor, once the castle vaults, has been turned into a 36-by-16-foot dining room with a curved ceiling and large wooden table surrounded by tartan-covered chairs.
 Upstairs, the 39-by-19-foot great hall, which has a large inglenook fireplace and flagstone floor, is used as a living room.
 Two winding stone staircases in the turrets are used to reach the five main bedrooms, which have en-suite bathrooms and carry names from the tower's history, including Carmichael, Ruthven and Erskine. The Stewart Suite is named in honor of King James VI of Scotland, the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, who was later King James I of England and Scotland.
 Mr. Macaskill's family, which includes his wife, Bridget, and their sons, John, 25, and Ben, 22, often stay at the castle. ''Our American visitors love it because it is a bit of history and it has been restored to such comfortable standards -- they often joke about Scottish hotels not having showers or enough hot water,'' Mr. Macaskill said.
 The family rents the property through Unique Home Stays of Britain, and it was used as a site for the BBC children's television program ''Balamory.''
 ''My wife and I were the first people to sleep in the tower for 350 years -- and I often have a night or two there on my own -- and it is a very peaceful, friendly building in which to stay,'' Mr. Macaskill said. ''It has been built and restored very carefully and proves there are still lots of extremely skilled people in Scotland.''

HEADLINE: Feeding Those Young and Curious Listeners

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
Le Poisson Rouge, the coolest place to hear contemporary music in New York, did little to celebrate its first anniversary on Sunday night. A renovated Bleecker Street club, formerly the Village Gate, it presented a typically adventurous program. Alarm Will Sound, the brilliant 20-member contemporary-music ensemble, conducted by Alan Pierson, played five polystylistic pieces by the audaciously eclectic composer Derek Bermel, who draws from firsthand exposure to indigenous music of West Africa and elsewhere. 
 John Schaefer, the WNYC announcer, introduced the program, interviewed Mr. Bermel and led a round of applause for Le Poisson Rouge, the only acknowledgment of its birthday. Yet in just a year this black-walled Greenwich Village basement club, which presents all styles of contemporary music (classical, indie rock, jazz, electro-acoustic, ethnic), has become so essential to the New York music scene that it seems as if it had been around longer. 
 There are alternative sites for experimental contemporary music, like Joe's Pub and the Cornelia Street Cafe in Greenwich Village, Roulette in SoHo, Barbes and the Issue Project Room in Brooklyn. But the programming of contemporary music from the classical tradition is especially lively at Le Poisson Rouge. 
 A ''multimedia art cabaret,'' as the club bills itself, Le Poisson Rouge was founded by David Handler, a violinist and composer, and Justin Kantor, a cellist, who began envisioning an alternative space for new music when they were students at the Manhattan School of Music. They were exasperated with the traditional concert setting, with its ''preacher and congregation seating,'' as the lanky, bearded Mr. Handler, 28, said in a recent interview. 
 ''Our mission here has been to foster a more symbiotic relationship between art and revelry,'' he said. ''Only in recent history have art and revelry diverged, and both are suffering from the breakup.''
 I made my first visit to the club in October, when the dynamic Jack Quartet played the complete string quartets by the thorny modernist Iannis Xenakis, who died in 2001. I never expected to hear these hard-driven, complex pieces played in a single program, let alone at a club before a packed house of mostly young people, sitting at tables and sipping drinks. Le Poisson Rouge relies on food and beverages to turn a profit. Its motto: ''Serving Art and Alcohol.'' 
 The barely known Xenakis quartets might have seemed a hard sell. But the club routinely attracts listeners curious about any kind of out-there contemporary music. The Jack Quartet certainly gets around the club scene in New York. A concert for its new recording of the Xenakis quartets on the Mode label will take place on July 5 at Joe's Pub, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year.
 Last month at Le Poisson Rouge I was exhilarated to hear a vibrant performance of Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' a path-breaking atonal score from 1912. Schoenberg's music is still stigmatized and feared by conservative segments of the classical music audience. So you can imagine how gratified the composer would have been to hear this fresh, keenly dramatic account of ''Pierrot Lunaire'' presented at an informal club for an eager and receptive audience.
 In a compelling performance, the veteran soprano Lucy Shelton was joined by five accomplished young instrumentalists from the Ensemble ACJW, part of the training academy run jointly by the Juilliard School and Carnegie Hall, in partnership with the New York City Department of Education. 
 In many ways the club was an ideal place to hear Schoenberg's seminal piece. ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' a setting of German translations of 21 French poems by the symbolist Belgian writer Albert Giraud, came out of the Berlin cabaret tradition. It was written for a noted actress, Albertine Zehme, who performed it in a Pierrot clown costume. Schoenberg composed the solo part in a Sprechstimme style, half spoken and half sung. ''Pierrot Lunaire'' may be a formidable modernist score, but it is also a dramatic recitation with weirdly mesmerizing music. 
 Given the dismaying lack of knowledge about classical music among young audiences today, Le Poisson Rouge and similar alternative sites are making a virtue of necessity. If you program Xenakis and Schoenberg alongside indie rock and experimental jazz, you are inviting audiences to put aside preconceptions and respond instinctively to everything. 
 Mr. Kantor and Mr. Handler are not enemies of categories. They acknowledge that different styles of new music come from different traditions, and they cede most of the programming decisions to a roster of experts, among them Ronen Givony, who lines up classical contemporary ensembles. Yet stylistic categories of modern music are blurring as never before. 
 Take indie rock. ''These days the pieces are longer, there is less emphasis on words and a more experimental approach to instrumentation,'' Mr. Handler said. So why not mix it up?
 On Wednesday night audiences at Le Poisson Rouge can hear Dinosaur Feathers, Browns and pow wow!, three indie rock and pop groups. But on Monday the contemporary ensemble Signal plays Steve Reich's Double Sextet, and on Tuesday the pianist Aki Takahashi plays works by Morton Feldman, Giacinto Scelsi and that Poisson Rouge regular, Xenakis. 
 There is no set arrangement for paying performers at Le Poisson Rouge. Depending on circumstances and the clout of the artists, some receive guaranteed fees. Others take a percentage of the receipts, or a combination of the two. A group can clear from $100 or less to $1,000 or more, Mr. Handler said. 
 With the severity of the recession, Le Poisson Rouge and similar clubs are at least offering artists, especially younger ones, an outlet. But another way to look at it is that these clubs are benefiting from the economic downturn, which is leaving performers eager for any exposure. Still, at every concert I have attended at Le Poisson Rouge, the classical performers have seemed elated to be reaching new audiences in this unconventional and liberating setting.
 On Monday night the pianist Bruce Brubaker, who has championed Minimalist and post-Minimalist composers, played a solo program of subdued works drawn from his new recording, ''Time Curve'' (Arabesque). He opened with ''The Time Curve Preludes,'' Book 1, by the American composer William Duckworth. Written in the late 1970s, these pieces subtly combine haunting repetitive patterns with hints of diverse musical idioms, like scat singing, Bartok dances and medieval chant. 
 As Mr. Brubaker explained to the audience, the preludes require the performer to place narrow metal weights on various keys in the piano's low register. This lifts the dampers on the selected notes, allowing the strings to resonate sympathetically as nearby keys are struck, creating a backdrop of continuous, softly droning sound. 
 Mr. Brubaker concluded his program with sensitive performances of ruminative pieces by Philip Glass: the Etude No. 5 and ''Metamorphosis Two.'' When the undulant chord patterns of the final work faded away, a rapt audience let the silence linger, then broke into whoops and cheers. One person shouted, ''Thank you.''
 A good start to Year 2 at Le Poisson Rouge.

HEADLINE: Home Construction Rebounds Solidly From April's Steep Decline

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Construction of new homes leapt back in May after dropping sharply a month earlier, the government reported on Tuesday, signaling that the housing and construction markets might be hitting a bottom.
 In another report, the government said that prices received by producers for finished goods rose a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in May, hinting that Wall Street's fears of inflation may be exaggerated. Still, energy prices rose the most since January, with gasoline prices up nearly 14 percent for the month.
 So-called core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, fell 0.1 percent, indicating broad pressure on prices because of lower demand across the economy. 
 On Wednesday, the government will release its monthly index of consumer prices, which reflects what consumers are paying at cash registers and gasoline pumps.
 Housing starts in the United States rose 17.2 percent from April -- far exceeding economists' expectations -- as construction of single-family homes increased for a third month. Construction of apartment buildings and condominiums rebounded after falling steeply in April.
 Building permits rose 4 percent for the month, but housing completions fell 3.3 percent from April. 
 Over all, housing starts in May increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 532,000, an improvement from earlier this year but still down 45.2 percent from the pace of home construction in May a year ago. 
 And while these levels of construction could mark a bottom, they are not likely to be the start of a turnaround, some experts said.
 ''There's a real possibility they will just stall at a low level,'' said Kenneth Simonson, chief economist of the Associated General Contractors of America. ''If the recent jump in interest rates is sustained, that could choke off buyer enthusiasm for new homes.''
 Rates on a 30-year fixed mortgage have risen to more than 5.5 percent, from record lows of 4.8 percent, since May as yields on government bonds crept up. Some housing experts worry that rising mortgage costs could reduce mortgage refinancing and drive potential buyers out of the housing market. Construction of multifamily units rose 61.7 percent in May to an annual rate of 131,000 units, after a decline of 49.4 percent in April. But economists said the multifamily sector of the housing market would probably stay weak, as evidenced by half-finished apartment towers across the country and the number of condo projects that are renting out units as a way to make money.
 ''The folks who would be renting homes are the ones having the hardest time finding or keeping jobs,'' Mr. Simonson said. ''New college graduates are moving back in with Mom and Dad instead of renting their first place.''
 Home builders are likely to remain wary of breaking ground on new projects, economists said. Credit markets remain tight for construction loans and potential buyers are still worried about losing their jobs or further declines in home values.
 While that means fewer construction jobs and more pain for contractors, electricians and other workers, many economists say that housing starts need to remain low to rebalance the gap between supply and demand in the housing market. About four million homes are now for sale, with more cheap foreclosures and distressed properties hitting the market every day.
 ''The inventory overhang means any recovery in building will be very muted for an extended period,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note. ''But at least the very worst is over.''
 In a third report, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production fell more than expected -- 1.1 percent -- in May. Output was also weaker -- down 0.7 percent -- in April than initially reported.

HEADLINE: G.M. Sells Saab to Swedish Consortium

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
General Motors announced Tuesday that it had agreed to sell its Swedish unit,Saab Automobile, to a consortium led by the sports car maker Koenigsegg Automotive.
 The companies said a deal was contingent on $600 million of financing from the European Investment Bank that is to be guaranteed by the Swedish government. They did not release further financial details of the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter. 
Saab sold 93,000 cars last year, and it has not turned a profit in years. With a narrow, though loyal, customer base focused on Sweden, Britain and the American Northeast, it proved too small to lure the world's big automakers, many of which are seeking tie-ups to increase economies of scale.
 Koenigsegg, an unlisted company with 45 employees based in Angelholm, Sweden, turns out just a few ''supercars'' -- high-performance sports cars costing more than $1 million each -- a year. It was founded by Christian von Koenigsegg; a Norwegian entrepreneur, Bard Eker, holds a 49 percent stake.
 ''I'm struggling to see the point of this deal,'' said Philippe Houchois, head of European auto industry research at UBS in London. ''Is it to ensure the survival of Saab, to save jobs? It looks like a short-term solution that doesn't resolve the core issues.''
 Saab, he added, is too small to make money in the long term.
 With its American parent in restructuring and the Swedish government taking a hard line, Saab filed for reorganization on Feb. 20. General Motors itself sought protection from creditors on June 1.
 G.M.'s filing did not include its European operations, which also include the British brand Vauxhall and Opel, both of which it is pooling under the Adam Opel unit in Germany. General Motors will retain a 35 percent stake in that business, which is being sold to Magna International, a Canadian auto parts maker, and Sberbank, a Russian lender, with support from the German government.
 In addition to Saab and Opel, G.M. is selling or eliminating three other brands. Hummer is being sold to a Chinese machinery company, Saturn is going to the Penske Automotive Group and Pontiac will be eliminated. ''This is yet another significant step in the reinvention of G.M. and its European operations,'' the G.M. Europe president, Carl-Peter Forster, said in a statement, and the deal represents ''the best chance for Saab to emerge a stronger company.''
 G.M. will provide Saab with some technology, and Saab will produce its new 9-5 model at its plant in Trollhattan, Sweden.

HEADLINE: Four Nations Seek More Diversity in Global Economic Order

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: YEKATERINBURG, Russia 

 BODY:
Leaders of the four largest emerging market economies discussed ways to reduce their reliance on the United States at their first formal summit meeting on Tuesday. But they concluded with only a cautious statement suggesting a move away from the dollar's role in global commerce and a call for greater representation of developing countries in global financial institutions. 
 By some predictions, the four nations, Brazil, Russia, India and China, a group referred to as the BRIC group, will surpass the current leading economies by the middle of this century, a tectonic shift that by this reckoning will eventually nudge the United States and Western Europe away from the center of world productivity and power. 
 Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, said the main point of the meeting was to show that ''the BRIC should create conditions for a more just world order.'' 
 The four countries produce about 15 percent of the world's gross domestic product and hold about 40 percent of the gold and hard currency reserves, but they are not a unified bloc and do not do enough business among themselves to justify a trade alliance.
 Russia and Brazil export natural resources, China exports manufactured goods and India bases its growth primarily on domestic demand. As such, India is not as concerned with the status of the dollar and is by no means as intent on scoring ideological points against the United States as is Russia. 
 The acronym BRIC was coined by a Goldman Sachs economist in 2001 to describe the four countries that were expected to surpass today's largest economies by 2050, owing to their faster growth rate. 
 A communique issued after the meeting highlighted the common goals of a ''greater voice'' in international financial institutions and a ''more diversified'' global monetary system. They agreed to meet again in 2010, in Brazil. 
 The gathering was the second of back-to-back summit meetings sponsored by Russia in this city in the Ural Mountains on the divide between Europe and Asia. 
 The Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a regional security alliance intended loosely as a counterweight to NATO, met in an expanded format with many Eurasian nations holding observer status. It even included a brief appearance by the president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose disputed re-election last week has touched off street demonstrations in Tehran. 
 In a sign of regional economic integration, China's president, Hu Jintao, pledged $10 billion in aid to Central Asian nations in the group, which consists of China, Russia and four former Soviet states: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. 
 Mr. Hu and Mr. Medvedev then met separately with India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and the Brazilian president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. 
 Mr. Medvedev encouraged China, the world's largest holder of dollar reserves, and other nations to put their money in some other currency or financial mechanism. He also urged members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to use their national currencies in conducting bilateral trade. 
 ''There can be no successful currency system, and particularly a global system, if the financial instruments that are used are denominated in only one currency,'' Mr. Medvedev said. ''Today, this is the case and the currency is the dollar.'' 
 A top economic policy aide to Mr. Medvedev, Arkady Dvorkovich, said Russia would like to diversify its currency reserves away from dollars by buying bonds from Brazil, China and India, but only if they bought Russian rubles as a reserve. 
 The dollar fell slightly against the euro and other currencies on Tuesday, though some traders quoted by Bloomberg News cited a more workaday cause: good results on new American housing starts were encouraging investors to move out of Treasury bonds and into equities.

HEADLINE: Iran's Hidden Revolution

BYLINE: By DANIELLE PLETKA and ALI ALFONEH. 
Danielle Pletka is the vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. Ali Alfoneh is a visiting fellow at the institute.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 JUST after Iran's rigged elections last week, with hundreds of thousands of protesters taking to the streets, it looked as if a new revolution was in the offing. Five days later, the uprising is little more than a symbolic protest, crushed by the elite Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. Meanwhile, the real revolution has gone unnoticed: the guard has effected a silent coup d'etat.
 The seeds of this coup were planted four years ago with the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. And while he has since disappointed his public, failing to deliver on promised economic and political reforms, his allies now control the country. In the most dramatic turnabout since the 1979 revolution, Iran has evolved from theocratic state to military dictatorship. 
 Disenchantment with clerical rule has been growing for years. To the urban youths who make up Iran's most active political class, the mullahs represent the crude rigidity of Islamic law. To the rural poor, they epitomize the corruption that has meant unbuilt schools, unpaved roads and unfulfilled promises of development. 
 This hostility overflowed during the 2005 presidential race, with the defeat of former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a cleric widely considered corrupt, by Mr. Ahmadinejad, a former officer in the Revolutionary Guards. 
 In Mr. Ahmadinejad, the public saw a man who repudiated the profligacy of the clerical class, a man who was ascetic, humble and devout. And he capitalized on that image to consolidate power and to promote his brothers in arms. Fourteen of the 21 cabinet ministers he has appointed are former members of the guards or its associated paramilitary, the Basij. Several, including Defense Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar, are veterans of notorious units thought to have supported terrorist operations in the 1980s. 
 This creeping militarization has not been restricted to the central government: provincial governors, press commissars, film directors, intelligence officers and business leaders are increasingly former members of the guard. The elite force controls much of the economy either directly -- the Basij has rights to oil extraction -- or through proxy companies like Khatam al Anbiya, which dominates construction throughout Iran. 
 Technically, the pinnacle of power in Iran remains Ayatollah Khamenei, along with the 12-member Guardian Council. Yet he has proved eager to fall in with the president's overthrow of the clerics. Indeed, Western intelligence services suspect Ayatollah Khamenei approved the rigging of the second round of the 2005 presidential election to throw decisive votes to Mr. Ahmadinejad. And this time around, the supreme leader made clear his preference with coded references like his exhortation to vote for ''a man of the people, sincere, with a simple lifestyle.'' 
 Why would he deliberately undercut his own clerical class? Survival. Far from fretting about an impending attack from Israel or America, guard leaders have been warning the ayatollah that the most formidable threat to the Islamic Republic is a ''soft regime change policy'' involving the use of ''orange revolutions'' (as the hard-line Iranian newspaper Kayhan recently editorialized).
 Encircled by American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, besieged from within by disgruntled citizens, the supreme leader has turned to a bellicose strongman to preserve the system that elevated him. Indeed, Ayatollah Khamenei -- who was scorned as a religious lightweight by many more established mullahs when he was chosen for the top post in 1989 -- has repeatedly shown himself willing to undercut the ''Islamic'' in Islamic revolution. In doing so, he has painted himself into a corner -- a permanent alliance with Mr. Ahmadinejad and the Revolutionary Guards. And this fraudulent election will only push them closer together. 
 Many have been struck by the crudeness of the recent vote rigging, with reformist candidates losing even their hometowns. The unusually speedy certification of the election and Ayatollah Khamenei's quick blessing -- ''a divine miracle'' -- only served to underscore an obvious sham. 
 Yet you don't have to be paranoid to wonder if events were following a script: protesters pour into the streets only to be beaten down by Revolutionary Guard and Basij gunmen; the regime is prepared to detain dissidents -- reportedly using Facebook and Twitter to locate them; Mr. Ahmadinejad is so unworried he jets off to Russia; and every element of the confrontation has provided a pretext for an overwhelming assertion of domestic power by the Revolutionary Guards.
 What does this mean for President Obama and the policy of engagement he hopes to pursue? Some will argue that Mr. Ahmadinejad may be in a conciliatory mood because he needs talks with the United States to underscore his own legitimacy, but that can only be read as a self-serving Washington perspective. Meanwhile, the Iranian people will have suffered the consolidation of power by a ruthless regime and the transformation of a theocracy to an ideological military dictatorship. That Iran neither needs nor wants accommodation with the West.

HEADLINE: A City Budget Short on Distress

 BODY:
Perhaps the best thing that most New Yorkers could say about the deal reached this week by Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the City Council on a nearly $60 billion budget is that it won't hurt as much as expected. 
 Just a few months ago, Mayor Bloomberg was threatening to cut the city's work force by 14,000. Firehouses would be closed, child-care workers fired and library hours shortened. Arts, health care and police training would all take major cuts.
 That gloomy picture is now a little less bleak. Health care, arts and police training will still suffer. But under the current deal, the budget -- which takes effect July 1 -- will result in only 2,000 lost jobs. The 16 firehouses set to be shuttered are safe, for now, and libraries will stay open six days a week. 
 This less-than-horrible future depends first on the mayor's assumption that the economy will pick up -- and with it, tax revenues. If it doesn't, the mayor warned, ''this may not be the last word'' on budgetary pain.
 Some analysts warn that the mayor's forecasts are more rosy than real. The city's Independent Budget Office predicts that revenues will be $1.1 billion less than the mayor's forecast -- a big gap if it's right. 
 The second problem is that in the short run, balancing this budget depends on -- gulp -- Albany. The city needs state legislators to approve a business tax adjustment and an increase in the sales tax of one-half of a percentage point to 8.875 percent. After an attempted takeover of the Senate by Republicans last week, Albany's entire lawmaking apparatus has ground to a standstill. 
 The city should be able to rumble along if the state gets its act together and comes through -- and Mr. Bloomberg's economic projections hold true. That should give the mayor and other candidates in the city some bragging rights for the fall elections. 
 Once the votes are counted in November, however, the city will have to start facing a $5 billion deficit for the fiscal year beginning in 2010 -- a problem it will have to confront without much surplus or stimulus funds as extra padding. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, who has been better than most at keeping the city's spending in check, has softened the blow this year. A softer 2010 budget, however, could mean a harder 2011 for New York City.

HEADLINE: A RECOUNT OFFER FAILS TO SILENCE PROTESTS IN IRAN

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI; Reporting was contributed by Bill Keller from Tehran; Clifford J. Levy from Moscow; Andrew E. Kramer from Yekaterinburg, Russia; Alan Cowell from Paris; and Sharon Otterman from New York.

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
Iran's leaders failed on Tuesday to halt a second day of huge demonstrations against last week's election results but, placed on the defensive, offered another concession to the sustained rage here, saying they would allow a limited recount. 
 They received a resounding refusal -- first from reformist politicians who said they would accept only a new election and then on the streets of the capital, Tehran. Supporters of the defeated opposition presidential candidate Mir Hussein Moussavi jammed into a line more than a mile long. They marched mostly in silence, some carrying signs in English asking, ''Where is my vote?'' 
 The numbers of opposition protesters did not match those on Monday, when hundreds of thousands of Iranians joined in the largest public demonstration since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, enraged that the conservative president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was declared the winner of Friday's election with 63 percent of the votes. 
 Fear, many said, was a factor. Seven protesters were killed overnight. Gritty and uncensored images, some taken by cellphone cameras, were beamed around the world via various Web sites. 
 ''Nothing will change if we don't come,'' said one protester, Madjid, 26, an employee of the Foreign Ministry who was afraid to give his family name. ''We need to become a big force to achieve what we want.''
 Worry over the future of Iran, a country crucially important for its oil, position next to Iraq and Afghanistan, its nuclear program and ties to extremist groups, spilled over its borders.
 In Washington, President Obama said that it would be counterproductive for the United States ''to be seen as meddling'' in the disputed Iranian presidential election. He dismissed criticism that he had failed to speak out forcefully enough about the growing unrest in Iran.
 ''I have deep concerns about the election,'' Mr. Obama told reporters at the White House. ''I think that the world has deep concerns about the election.''
 As the confrontation inside Iran continued to build momentum on Tuesday, each side laid down more cards. 
 Reformers, with substantial popular support but without the power of the state, worked to gain religious backers, urging clerics to break with the government. ''No one in his sane mind can accept these results,'' a senior opposition cleric, Hassan-Ali Montazeri, said in a public letter posted on his Web site. 
 The government, meanwhile, sought to limit the damage by cracking down with only limited success on electronic media, revoking press credentials for foreign journalists and ordering journalists not to report on the streets. Supporters of Mr. Ahmadinejad -- though apparently less than 10,000 of them -- marched through Tehran's streets proclaiming their candidate the election's fair winner and chanting, ''Rioters should be executed!''
 In an intervention that suggested a growing concern over the scale of the protests, the nation's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, took the unusual step of meeting with representatives of the four presidential candidates, urging national unity for the second time in recent days. He did not address the protesters' demands for a new election. 
 The Guardian Council, the watchdog body that needs to certify the results, said it was willing to conduct a partial recount of the votes, the IRNA news agency reported. Ayatollah Khamenei, who had urged the council on Monday to examine the vote-rigging claims, said Tuesday that the candidates needed to resolve the issue through legal channels. 
 Mr. Moussavi's representative, Ali Akbar Mohtashamipour, said a recount would not meet the demands of the protesters, Ghalamnews, a Web site linked to Mr. Moussavi, reported. 
 ''We believe there has been fraud because our representatives were not allowed to supervise the elections, and we have evidence of many irregularities,'' he was quoted as saying. 
 He gave an example: votes cast at some polling places, he said, exceeded the number of eligible voters in those areas. He also said the Guardian Council had not been impartial before the election because some of its members even campaigned for Mr. Ahmadinejad. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad, appearing to try to project the image of a leader with a secure grip on power, left Iran for Russia on Tuesday for a meeting on international security.
 In Yekaterinburg, Russia, for a summit meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Mr. Ahmadinejad did not mention the Iranian election but gave a speech in which he referred to regional problems, describing Iraq, Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories as occupied and unstable.
 He added: ''The current political and economic order is approaching the end of its mastery of the world. It is absolutely clear that the epoch of empire has come to an end.''
 Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, told reporters that Russia had warm relations with Iran. ''Elections in Iran are an internal affair of the Iranian people, but we welcome the newly elected president of that state,'' Mr. Ryabkov said.
 Leaders in Western Europe continued to voice concerns about the election, with the strongest remarks coming from President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who said Tuesday that the ''extent of the fraud'' in Iran was ''proportional to the violent reaction'' in the country, news agencies reported.
 In response, the Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the French ambassador to protest Mr. Sarkozy's remarks, the ISNA news agency reported. The British ambassador was also summoned after Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged the Iranian government to listen to its people. 
 Despite the crackdown on the news media, an extraordinary amount of information about the protests in Tehran and other cities reached the outside world. On Tuesday, many Web sites posted a wrenching video that purported to show the death of a student in Isfahan in a shooting by pro-government militia members. Other videos showed bleeding and inert demonstrators from Tehran after the large protests on Monday. 
 In Tuesday's demonstration here, a witness saw a member of the Basij militia loyal to Mr. Ahmadinejad opening fire on a group of people, hitting one person in the neck. Protesters attacked a group of the militia members and set one of their motorcycles on fire. 
 There were reports that at least two moderate politicians, Mohammad Ali Abtahi and Saeed Hajarian, as well as two other activists, were arrested on Tuesday. The government arrested more than 100 politicians and activists on Sunday. Some have been released.

(PHOTOGRAPH BY NEWSHA TAVAKOLIAN/POLARIS, FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (pg.A12) GRAPHICS: QUESTIONING THE RESULTS: As voter turnout has increased in elections since the 1980s, the percentage won by the top vote-getter in the first round of balloting has generally decreased. So, many were surprised that Mr. Ahmadinejad won such a large majority of the vote in an election where the turnout jumped to 85 percent from 63 percent in 2005. Since President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was announced the winner of Friday's election in Iran with about 63 percent of the vote, supporters of Mir Hussein Moussavi, a reformist candidate, have protested the result, alleging election violations and irregularities in the vote tallies. Mr. Moussavi, an Azeri, did not do as well as expected, especially in East Azerbaijan, his home province. He was also expected to do better with other ethnic minorities in the outer provinces, where he focused his campaign. In the first round of voting in the 2005 presidential election, an Azeri candidate finished last but won the Azeri provinces. Mr. Karroubi, a reformist cleric, did much worse than in 2005, when he won 11 provinces and 55 percent of the vote in his native Lorestan in the first round of voting. This year, Mr. Ahmadinejad won 71 percent of the vote in Lorestan, a dramatic increase from his 9 percent showing in 2005. (Sources: Sources: Iranian Interior Ministry

HEADLINE: G.M. Sells Saab to Swedish Automaker

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
General Motors announced Tuesday that it had agreed to sell its Swedish unit, Saab Automobile, to a consortium led by the sports car maker, Koenigsegg Automotive.
 The companies said a deal was contingent on $600 million of financing from the European Investment Bank that is to be guaranteed by the Swedish government. They did not release further financial details of the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter.
Saab sold 93,000 cars last year, and it has not turned a profit in years. With a narrow, though loyal, customer base focused on Sweden, Britain and the American Northeast, it proved too small to lure the world's big automakers, many of which are seeking tie-ups to increase economies of scale. 
 Koenigsegg, an unlisted company with 45 employees based in Angelholm, Sweden, turns out just a few ''supercars'' -- high-performance sports cars costing more than $1 million each -- a year. It was founded by Christian von Koenigsegg; a Norwegian entrepreneur, Bard Eker, holds a 49 percent stake.
 ''I'm struggling to see the point of this deal,'' said Philippe Houchois, head of European auto industry research at UBS in London. ''Is it to ensure the survival of Saab, to save jobs? It looks like a short-term solution that doesn't resolve the core issues.''
 Saab, he added, is too small to make money in the long term.
 With its American parent in restructuring and the Swedish government taking a hard line, Saab filed for reorganization on Feb. 20. General Motors itself sought protection from creditors on June 1.
 G.M.'s filing did not include its European operations, which also include the British brand Vauxhall and Opel, both of which it is pooling under the Adam Opel unit in Germany. General Motors will retain a 35 percent stake in that business, which is being sold to Magna International, a Canadian auto parts maker, and Sberbank, a Russian lender, with support from the German government.
 In addition to Saab and Opel, G.M. is selling or eliminating three other brands. About two weeks ago, G.M. reached a preliminary agreement for the sale of Hummer to a machinery company in western China, Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company. Last week, G.M. agreed to sell Saturn to the Penske Automotive Group, whose chairman is Roger Penske, 72, one of the nation's biggest automobile dealers. It also plans to eliminate the Pontiac brand in 2010.
 ''This is yet another significant step in the reinvention of G.M. and its European operations,'' the G.M. Europe president, Carl-Peter Forster, said in a statement, and the deal represents ''the best chance for Saab to emerge a stronger company.''
 G.M. will provide Saab with some parts and technology, and Saab will keep production of its new 9-5 model at its facility in Trollhattan, Sweden, as opposed to the Russelsheim, Germany, plant where it makes the current version. G.M. and Koenigsegg will jointly finance the introduction of some products in the pipeline.
 Jan Ake Jonsson, managing director of Saab automobile, hailed the deal in the statement as ''great news'' for Saab's customers, dealers, suppliers and employees. Saab's union employees also backed the deal.
 Saab has said it would need about $1 billion to carry out its business plans. It got $150 million of that from G.M. in February.
 Mr. Houchois said the $600 million that the Swedish government is being asked to guarantee is ''a big chunk of money, given the uncertainty about sustainability of the business.'' The government is ready to open talks with the European Investment Bank on that financing, Bloomberg News reported.
 Halldora von Koenigsegg, executive manager at Koenigsegg Automotive, said she could not comment on negotiations over the financing. She also declined to identify the other members of the consortium, which is called the Koenigsegg Group.
 Jan Ake Jonsson, managing director of Saab automobile, hailed the deal in the statement as ''great news for Saab's current and future customers, dealers, suppliers and employees around the globe.''

HEADLINE: OBAMA ENLISTED BROAD CONSENSUS ON FINANCE RULES

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; John Harwood contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama's plan to reshape financial regulation, which he will unveil on Wednesday, is the product of weeks of meetings among government officials, financial experts, lawmakers, industry executives and lobbyists, many of whom were invited to help the White House draft the proposal.
 Mr. Obama told reporters on Tuesday that a ''lack of oversight'' allowed what he called ''wild risk-taking.'' He said it led to ''very dangerous'' conditions that imperiled the global economy. 
 But executives from an array of industries caught up in the financial crisis came to Washington over the last several weeks to make their case for how the new regulatory landscape should look. They came from big banks and small ones, insurance companies and stock exchanges, hedge funds and mutual funds, and were joined by officials from consumer groups and big labor -- often with conflicting views. 
 Now, lobbyists who lost the initial skirmish inside the administration will head to Congress to try to influence the final product.
 The plan the president will formally announce on Wednesday would give the Federal Reserve greater supervisory authority over large financial institutions whose problems pose potential risks to the economic system. It would separately expand the reach of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to seize and break up troubled financial institutions. And it would create a council of regulators, led by the Treasury secretary, to fill in regulatory gaps.
 In doing so, the plan seeks to give Washington the tools to police the shadow system of finance that has grown up outside the government's purview, and to make it easier for regulators to head off problems at large, troubled institutions or take control of them if they fail. 
 ''Unfortunately the growth of the nonbank sector as well as all the complexities and financial instruments outstripped those old regulatory regimes,'' Mr. Obama said in an interview on Tuesday with The New York Times and CNBC. 
 Although it would strikingly reorganize the regulatory architecture, the president's plan results from many compromises with industry executives and lawmakers, and is not as bold as some had hoped. 
 Mr. Obama seemed to acknowledge as much when he posed the question: ''Did, you know, any considerations of sort of politics play into it? We want to get this thing passed, and, you know, we think that speed is important. We want to do it right. We want to do it carefully. But we don't want to tilt at windmills.''
 At the White House and the Treasury Department in recent weeks, some insurance companies sought a law that would enable them to get a single federal charter instead of multiple state charters. The insurers lost. Consumer groups argued against the banks in favor of a consumer financial protection agency with broad new authority to protect homeowners from unsuitable loans. The consumer groups prevailed. 
 The mutual fund industry successfully argued against a proposal by some banks -- which are competitors to mutual funds -- to give the Securities and Exchange Commission's authority over mutual funds to the new consumer agency.
 Hedge funds and dealers in derivatives sought to minimize the extent to which the government will intrude into their businesses. They partly won; the administration will leave many of the details of that authority to lawmakers and regulators. Savings and loan associations argued unsuccessfully against a proposal by the administration to eliminate federal savings and loan charters, which have been subject to less regulation than bank charters. 
 The administration, which has sought to reduce the corrosive influence of lobbying on policy making, actually encouraged the tussle by inviting executives, academics, former officials and others to the series of meetings overseen by the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, and Lawrence H. Summers, the president's top economic adviser. The meetings were often attended by their top aides: the deputy Treasury secretary, Neal S. Wolin, and Diana Farrell, a deputy director of the National Economic Council at the White House. 
 In the last two weeks alone, the administration has heard from top executives from Goldman Sachs, MetLife, Allstate, JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, Barclays, UBS, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Travelers, Prudential and Wells Fargo, among others. Administration officials also discussed the president's plan with the top lobbyists at major financial trade associations in Washington.
 The raucous process of overhauling a system that oversees the nation's most influential and affluent corporate interests is not without precedent. In 1913, the year he signed the law creating the Federal Reserve in response to an earlier market panic, President Woodrow Wilson lamented to a friend about banking reform. 
 ''There are almost as many judgments as there are men,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''To form a single plan and a single intention about it at times seems a task so various and so elusive that it is hard to keep one's heart from failing.''
 President Obama's plan would not consolidate all the banking agencies into one, but it would take some of the existing agencies' powers to oversee mortgages, credit cards and other kinds of consumer debt and give them to a new regulator, tentatively called the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. 
 The president, however, will ask Congress to merge the Office of Thrift Supervision, the beleaguered agency that missed problems at IndyMac, Washington Mutual and the American International Group, into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a Treasury unit that supervises the largest banks. 
 The plan would impose tighter rules on banks that package and sell securities that are backed by mortgages and other debt. It would require that companies that issue mortgages retain at least 5 percent of them on their books to discourage companies from marketing unsuitable loans. 
 It would also require all advisers of hedge funds and private equity funds to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and open their books to regulators. And it would impose new conflict of interest rules on the credit rating agencies.
 The plan is largely the product of extensive conversations between senior administration officials and top Democratic lawmakers -- primarily Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut. The two lawmakers head the Congressional committees that will take the first crack at drafting the legislation necessary to make the plan work.

HEADLINE: MySpace Set To Lay Off 400 Workers

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
The latest step in Rupert Murdoch's effort to turn around the fortunes of his digital businesses came Tuesday in the form of hefty layoffs at MySpace.
 MySpace, the social networking site owned by News Corporation, the media conglomerate controlled by Mr. Murdoch, said it was laying off roughly 400 employees, or nearly 30 percent of its staff. After the layoffs, MySpace will have about 1,000 workers.
 The company said the layoffs were an attempt to return to a ''start-up culture.'' 
 In a statement, Owen Van Natta, a former Facebook executive who became chief executive of MySpace in April, said: ''Simply put, our staffing levels were bloated and hindered our ability to be an efficient and nimble team-oriented company. I understand these changes are painful for many. They are also necessary for the long-term health and culture of MySpace. Our intent is to return to an environment of innovation that is centered on our user and our product.''
 MySpace, which was acquired by News Corporation in 2005 for $580 million, was once the pre-eminent social networking site. But more recently it has lost some luster to Facebook, and at the same time has come up short of News Corporation's financial projections. 
 Until recently, MySpace still had an advantage over Facebook in the United States, although Facebook had more users globally. But recently, according to comScore, Facebook has matched MySpace in the United States, with about 70 million members.
 MySpace's identity is closely associated with entertainment and music -- a place where, for example, an upstart band would go to find a following. But Facebook has become the gathering place for users who want to share photos and connect with long-lost friends.
 ''Right now, MySpace has been attempting to compete to be the biggest social networking site,'' said Josh Bernoff, an analyst at Forrester Research. ''I don't think that's been successful. If MySpace is about your entertainment life, Facebook is about your whole life.''
 Financially, MySpace is said to be profitable but has fallen short of expectations at a time when some of News Corporation's other business, like newspapers and local television, have been a drain on the company's earnings.
 Last year, Fox Interactive Media, the unit that includes MySpace, fell about 10 percent short of a $1 billion revenue projection. In the latest quarter the company did not break out revenue for the unit, but did say that revenue at an operating division, of which Fox Interactive Media is a large component, decreased by $254 million, or 35 percent.
 In the previous quarter, the unit had declines in both revenue and operating income.
 In addition, News Corporation also cut jobs at the unit. ''We are examining the operating structure of Fox Interactive Media and its role as a corporate umbrella for a number of our digital businesses,'' said Dan Berger, a spokesman for the unit. ''In conjunction with the MySpace staff cuts this week, we reduced our corporate F.I.M. staff and also assigned certain positions to specific business units,'' he added, referring to Fox Interactive Media.
 To revamp MySpace, Mr. Murdoch has lately engineered a series of management changes.
 In April, News Corporation appointed Jon Miller, the former chief executive of America Online, as the chief digital officer of the company, overseeing MySpace and the company's other Internet businesses -- Photobucket, IGN Entertainment and the company's interest in Hulu, the online video partnership with NBC Universal.
 Mr. Miller wasted little time in making changes. 
 Just weeks later he pushed out Chris DeWolfe, one of the founders and then the chief executive of MySpace. Tom Anderson, another founder of the social networking site, has stayed on.

HEADLINE: Proposal to Raise Income Tax in Pennsylvania

BYLINE: By SEAN D. HAMILL

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
Facing a projected $3.2 billion revenue shortfall this year, Gov. Edward G. Rendell on Tuesday proposed temporarily raising the personal income tax rate by 16 percent for the next three years. 
 Mr. Rendell, a Democrat, said in his February budget proposal for the 2010 fiscal year that he would not suggest raising sales or income taxes. But the worsening economic conditions ''blew the wheels off that idea,'' he said in a telephone interview on Tuesday between stops around the state to promote his plan. 
 The income tax increase would be the second of Mr. Rendell's administration and would push the tax rate to 3.57 percent from 3.07 percent, raising about $1.5 billion. The last one, a permanent increase, came in 2004. 
 Pennsylvania currently has the nation's second-lowest state income tax, and even with the increase would have the fourth lowest, Mr. Rendell said. He also said the state had a history of temporary income tax increases during recessions. Similar proposals were approved in 1983 under Gov. Richard L. Thornburgh, a Republican, and in 1991 under Gov. Robert P. Casey Sr., a Democrat.
 Critics vowed to fight the proposal. ''We think this would be absolutely the worst time to be raising taxes on working Pennsylvanians and small-business owners,'' said Matthew Brouillette, the president of the conservative Commonwealth Foundation, which argues that an increase will result in the loss of about 24,000 jobs. 
 But Sharon Ward, executive director of the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, a liberal think tank, said she believed it was the best solution to the budget crisis.
 When Mr. Rendell presented his $29 billion budget, the deficit was projected at $2.3 billion and he said he would not propose any broad-based tax increases.
 But after Republican leaders in the State Senate proposed a $27.3 billion budget in May that was balanced by $3 billion in cuts to education, law enforcement, social programs and other areas that Democrats said were imprudent, Mr. Rendell said all options were on the table.
 Mr. Rendell said he did not know if the legislature would approve the tax increase.

HEADLINE: Emphasizing Past Promises, and a Tax Burden

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
One of two 15-second commercials released by the Republican Governors Association began running on Tuesday on television broadcasts out of New York and Philadelphia and on cable stations in New Jersey in support of Christopher J. Christie's campaign against the state's Democratic governor, Jon S. Corzine. 
 TITLE ''New Jersey: Taxes''
 PRODUCER Red Sea LLC
 THE SCRIPT A woman announcer says: ''Jon Corzine told us he wouldn't raise taxes. But in his very first budget, he pushed for a 16 percent sales tax hike. Now, he wants to eliminate middle-class property tax rebates. Corzine -- Watch what he does, not what he says.''
 ON THE SCREEN Grainy images from a commercial for Mr. Corzine's 2005 campaign are intended to illustrate his past promises. Juxtaposed with those, none too subtly, are images of a cash register ringing up ''$ TAX'' and a picture of a mischievous-looking Mr. Corzine seeming to look down on his own earlier ad, and its promises, with amusement. The words ''16% tax hike'' and ''eliminate property tax deductions, rebates'' are highlighted. Finally, captions urge viewers to ''Fight Corzine's Taxes!'' and to sign a petition at a Web site, JerseyPays.com.
 ACCURACY Mr. Corzine pushed through a measure increasing the sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent to close a $4.5 billion budget deficit after taking office in 2006. His latest austerity budget, to close a $2 billion gap, calls for eliminating property-tax rebates for most homeowners, with exceptions for the elderly and disabled. Budgets represent choices, particularly in times of fiscal cuts, but to say Mr. Corzine ''wanted'' to eliminate the rebates is to ignore the dimensions of the crisis he faced.
 SCORECARD Anticipating a deluge of Corzine commercials attacking Mr. Christie, Republicans are trying to inoculate voters against them by depicting Mr. Corzine as someone who will say anything to get elected. These ads have the advantage of bashing Mr. Corzine for New Jersey's high tax burden, which consistently ranks atop the list of voters' complaints. The ads completely ignore any mitigating factors, like the collapse of Wall Street, the worst recession in decades and resulting budget deficits caused by factors largely outside of Mr. Corzine's control. But polls suggest that voters are not cutting Mr. Corzine much slack either, so far. DAVID M. HALBFINGER

HEADLINE: End of Incentives Worries European Carmakers

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
As a cash-for-clunkers program is considered by Congress, European carmakers say they are worried about the impact of weaning themselves off similar incentives when they expire this year.
 The payments have proved to be a huge success among consumers across Europe since they were introduced in late 2008. In Germany, they have helped increase sales by about 40 percent from a year ago. But for car companies, living without them will not be easy, said Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Renault and Nissan and chairman of the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
 ''The incentives have given us some breathing room and obviously we are worried about what happens when they end,'' Mr. Ghosn said in an interview in Brussels. ''We are worried because we know it will have a negative impact. Hopefully, the economy will have improved enough by then so that the impact will not be too dramatic.'' 
 Halting the incentives is proving much more complicated than introducing them. Germany has already extended the deadline of its program once, and French automakers want them to continue beyond their scheduled elimination at the end of 2009.
 The demand for new cars, however, is not expected to improve by then, leaving automakers wondering how they can tempt consumers to buy cars.
 While Mr. Ghosn said that the American market could begin recovering by the end of 2009, he asserted that an upswing in Europe would take much longer. ''I don't see any improvement before 2011,'' he said. ''It would take a miracle for the car industry to see growth in Europe before 2011.''
 Mr. Ghosn acknowledged that the incentives could not last forever, but he and other European auto executives argued that other government support was still critical, especially access to loans for the industry itself to help it survive the fallout of the financial crisis. 
 The American version of the cash-for-clunkers plan is much more complicated than the German package. The plan in the United States allows only drivers of cars that get 18 miles a gallon or less to trade in their vehicles. The vouchers will be worth $3,500 to $4,500, depending on the fuel efficiency of the car purchased. 
 Under Berlin's rules, eligible cars just have to be at least nine years old. Drivers get 2,500 euros ($3,462) for a new car, regardless of its size or fuel efficiency. 
 Perhaps because of that, the German offer quickly exceeded expectations. But for all its success, it also serves as a warning on how quickly government-financed trade-in incentives can grow in size and staying power. 
 When it was introduced in January, Berlin envisioned spending 1.5 billion euros to get 600,000 clunkers off the road. But as demand mounted in March and April, politicians raised the budget to 5 billion euros for two million cars and extended the deadline through the end of 2009. 
 As a result, new vehicle registrations in May grew at their fastest pace since 1991, according to figures released Tuesday by the German Automotive Association. 
 ''The scrapping plan is only a bridge to get us to next year, when we hope exports pick up,'' said Andreas Kraus, a spokesman for the group. ''Of course it's temporary but it gives us time.''
 Despite the environmental benefits of getting gas-guzzlers off the road, some experts say it only postpones the pain.
 ''It effectively transfers the downside risk from 2009 to 2010,'' said David Arnold of Credit Suisse in London. ''They will not be able to simply end market incentivization -- it has to be done gradually.''
 Even a gentle reduction of incentives, Mr. Arnold said, could cause ''a material drop in sales to transpire next year.''
 The American version of the plan is part of a broader military spending bill. The House on Tuesday passed legislation allowing consumers to use vehicle trade-in vouchers worth as much as $4,500 to buy new vehicles. The provision now goes to the Senate for a vote. It would cost $1 billion and Congressional backers said that it could spur the sale of up to 250,000 cars and trucks. 
 Mr. Ghosn's gloom about any quick global recovery stands in contrast to the optimism that has accompanied a recent flurry of deal making in the auto industry. This month, Chrysler exited bankruptcy, while General Motors started what promises to be a relatively quick trip through bankruptcy court.
 Magna International, a Canadian auto parts maker, reached a tentative deal to acquire most of G.M.'s European business, while a Swedish carmaker agreed Tuesday to buy Saab, which is also owned by G.M.
 Renault was rumored to be interested in buying G.M.'s Saturn unit as part of a return to the American market after a two-decade absence. But Mr. Ghosn said neither possibility was under consideration, with other, more promising regions commanding his attention. 
 ''We have so many other priorities to deal with, like Russia,'' he said. ''We have a new plant in Morocco, we have the projects in India. The priority is to weather the crisis and prepare for the postcrisis era -- returning to the U.S. is not on the agenda.''
 Mr. Ghosn said that he had discussed supplying parts to Saturn, which is to be sold to the Penske Automotive Group, but ''this was business as usual.'' 
 As the head of both Nissan, which derives the majority of its sales from Japan and North America, as well as the Europe-focused Renault, Mr. Ghosn has an unusual perch from which to judge the global industry.
 In fact, his decision to oversee two companies simultaneously has been cited by some observers as a model for Sergio Marchionne of Fiat, who is now also running Chrysler. Does he have any advice for Mr. Marchionne?
 ''I've learned a lot of things, obviously,'' he said with a laugh. ''This is competitive knowledge which I cannot share with my competitors.''
 On a more serious note, he said he was skeptical that all of the current and new companies could survive. ''I don't think the movie is finished, what we've seen are chapters,'' he said. ''I'm not sure that at the end of the day there will be more industry players than before.''

HEADLINE: Innocent Googling? No Such Thing in Tehran

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
Back before the election and the ensuing pandemonium, some journalists stopped for lunch at a cafe in north-central Tehran, a place with pictures of Shakespeare and Samuel Beckett where the stern visage of the late Ayatollah Khomeini is more customary, and where the background music was American jazz.
 What's that record? a newcomer to town asked the proprietor. He held up a CD case of the great bluesman John Lee Hooker. Really? The singer known as the Boogie Man played jazz? ''Hooooker!'' he insisted. 
 Well, you never know. Worth a check. But back at the hotel, a Google search produced a yellow triangle with an exclamation point and a warning: Access to this site is denied.
 What? Oh. Of course. ''Hooker.''
 Welcome to the Islamic Republic, where we protect you from yourself. You have much to learn.
 Pick a Theory
 Iranians are generally united in viewing the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to another four-year term as a miracle.
 Some believe it in the literal sense that the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, seemed to intend when he said ''the miraculous hand of God'' was at work. Others believe it in the sense that they see no earthly explanation why an incumbent who presided over worsening inflation, unemployment and isolation would draw more than seven million more votes than in his first victory.
 Cosmopolitan Iranians are full of theories to explain why so many of their compatriots put up with -- indeed, welcome -- the paternalism of their quasi theocracy. 
 From an electrical engineer: ''Iranians are monarchists.'' The 1979 Islamic Revolution did not expel the shah, this man contends. It replaced him with a supreme leader -- an ayatollah whose word is quite literally law and is rarely questioned in public. Even the protesters in the streets chanting ''Death to the dictator'' chant nothing about the man who has been cleric in chief for the past 20 years, Ayatollah Khamenei.
 From a writer: ''We are like sexually abused children.'' Violated by the ones they look to for protection, she said, they think that it is their own fault, that they are abused because they deserve it. They don't talk about it, because they are ashamed.
 An outsider might be tempted by a more mundane theory, that Iranians exhaust their need for freedom on the road.
 Iranians drive fast and close. They run lights, play chicken, zoom motorbikes down sidewalks, make extraordinary use of reverse gear.
 Two friends who had lived in the United States were chatting recently. ''I miss the freedom,'' said one. ''Yes,'' replied his friend, ''but in the U.S., can you back up on the freeway?'' 
 Is it relevant, then, that Mr. Ahmadinejad -- ''Dr. Ahmadinejad,'' as he is addressed by his followers -- has a Ph.D. in traffic engineering?
 Blaming the Messengers
 Conspiracy theories seem to flourish in secretive authoritarian governments, perhaps because such systems are essentially conspiracies themselves. In Iran, this is true of the general public; witness the number of people who took their own pens to the voting booths on Friday for fear the government-supplied pens would contain disappearing ink.
 And it is true in spades of their rulers. Mr. Ahmadinejad's list of those out to get Iran includes most of the post-World War II order, but at the moment it is focused on the Western news media, without whose meddling, he suggests, the Iranian people would be happily united and compliant.
 Not to worry. On Sunday, Iran's acting police chief, Ahmadreza Radan, gave the state press service an update on the arrests of protesters, and assured the public that ''in the interrogation of related rebels, we intend to find the link between the plotters and foreign media.''
 Already, text-messaging, Web sites, mobile phones, social networking services and other possible avenues of outside agitation have been rendered sporadic by government interference.
 Today the aptly named Ministry of Guidance announced that the work credentials of nonresident journalists had been revoked, and that authorities ''would not be responsible'' for anything that befell reporters who continued to cover the daily resistance. Visas are rapidly expiring and are not being renewed.
 Out of Camera Range
 For a sense of what may await Iran's discontented when there is no one around to report on it, consider Monday night in Isfahan, Iran's third largest city and a five-hour drive from the nearest foreign TV camera.
 As in Tehran, large parts of the city -- the squares and boulevards -- were scenes of smoke and flames, tear gas, stones crashing into windows, bloodied heads.
 The uprising seemed more organic than organized -- groups of a few dozen merging into groups of a few hundred, converging on lines of helmeted riot police officers, chanting ''Death to the dictator!''
 But in Isfahan the police response seemed far tougher. 
 At one point, a white S.U.V. with a red ambulance-style light raced up behind a knot of protesters and smashed into them, running one over before racing a few blocks to the protection of the riot police.
 Bands of Basiji, the authorized plainclothes vigilantes riding motorbikes and wielding long truncheons, were let loose by the hundreds to sow fear far afield from the actual unrest. Many wore the green headbands of the opposition -- possibly to camouflage, or to confuse.
 At one point some bystanders (including one journalist with a gift for being in the wrong place) were cornered on the ancient Si-o-Seh Bridge and faced a choice between getting their heads broken or tumbling 20 feet to the dry Zayandeh River bed. At the last minute, the thugs were distracted by other prey to beat on.
 At 10 p.m., as in Tehran, a more lyrical form of protest broke out: protesters chanting in waves from the rooftops of their homes, ''God is great! Death to the dictator!'' In some parts of Isfahan, residents said, plainclothes thugs went door to door, smashing windows and sometimes shooting canisters of tear gas into homes.

HEADLINE: National G.O.P. Group Takes Aim at Corzine

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
Down in the polls, New Jersey's embattled Democratic governor, Jon S. Corzine, is already trying to demonize his opponent, Christopher J. Christie, a former federal prosecutor. But national Republicans sprang to Mr. Christie's aid on Tuesday with commercials depicting Mr. Corzine as someone who will say anything to win re-election, and who cannot be trusted.
 Just two weeks into what is shaping up to be an unusually long and contentious general election campaign, the advertisements running on both sides neatly crystallize the two sides' strategies thus far. In Mr. Corzine's eyes, his challenger is a George W. Bush clone named ''Republican Chris Christie,'' who would ravage the environment, curtail abortion rights and wreak fiscal havoc. 
 In Mr. Christie's eyes, Mr. Corzine repeatedly broke his promises to avoid raising taxes, and failed at managing the economy despite his vaunted Wall Street experience.
 That, at least, is the message of two new television advertisements from the Republican Governors Association, which is backing Mr. Christie and plans to invest heavily in the New Jersey race, particularly now that the most recent polls show Mr. Corzine trailing by about 10 percentage points and receiving consistently low approval ratings.
 Mr. Christie, who by participating in New Jersey's public financing system will be limited to spending about $11 million on his campaign, will most likely refrain from television commercials until the fall. But Mr. Corzine, who has spent tens of millions of dollars in each of his two prior races, began running ads against Mr. Christie last week, tying him to Mr. Bush and emphasizing his conservatism.
 ''There's no question that Jon Corzine can't campaign on his record as governor, so he's going to try to buy this election like he has his United States Senate seat and his governor's seat, by throwing false attacks at Chris Christie,'' said Nick Ayers, the executive director of the Republican Governors Association.
 ''This is our plan to offset that,'' Mr. Ayers added. ''If there is a dialogue on issues throughout the summer, then we go into the fall in a very good position. But if it's a one-way dialogue about Jon Corzine's interpretation of who Chris Christie is, not that that's a fair interpretation, but that's a very different race.''
 The advertisements hit back by suggesting that Mr. Corzine's campaign commercials and promises are not to be believed. ''Watch what he does, not what he says,'' each warns.
 (A related Web site, www.jerseypays.com, also points to a faux news site, modeled after The New York Times's Web site, that amounts to a repository of commentary critical of Mr. Corzine.)
 It remains to be seen how intensively the air war will be waged during the summer, when voters' attention is usually elsewhere. The new Republican commercials are only 15 seconds long, but they are running on broadcast and cable stations.
 Mr. Ayers said the association planned a sustained effort to hold Mr. Corzine's record against him from now until November. 
 ''People ask me, 'If he spends $50 million, can you all really overcome that?' '' he said. ''I'll concede that money is the mother's milk of politics, but $50 million can't make an ugly baby pretty.''

HEADLINE: The All-American Back From Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN

 BODY:
AS you have surely noticed, all- American preppy style has come back for another goround. There is madras everything, button-downs everywhere. Nantucket reds -- washed-out pink pants -- are the new khakis; Sperry Top-Siders are more common on roof decks than top decks; and the Polo pony and the Lacoste crocodile are now but two of the critters in a zoo of polo shirt insignia.
 Lately the trend has taken on a new dimension, via the Internet, with a resurgence of interest in once obscure American brands. Alongside the familiar L. L. Bean duck boots, Brooks Brothers shirts and Ray-Ban Wayfarers, there are Filson duffel bags, Gokey boots, Alden dress shoes, Gitman oxford shirts, Quoddy Trail moccasins, Wm. J. Mills canvas totes -- to name but a few. Moribund brands like Southwick and Woolrich are being revived with new designs. And the old-school look has been furthered by popular American fashion labels -- small houses like Thom Browne, Band of Outsiders and Benjamin Bixby along with megabrands like J. Crew and Ralph Lauren.
As fashion moments go, this is as all-American as it gets, right? 
 Actually, no. What makes today's prepidemic so fascinating is how it is, surprisingly enough, so Japanese. The look has its roots in the United States, to be sure. But the spirit, rigor and execution of today's prep moment is as Japanese as Sony. One need only flip through the intriguing Japanese book ''Take Ivy,'' a collection of photographs taken in 1965 by Teruyoshi Hayashida on Eastern college campuses, to get the drift.
 ''Take Ivy'' has always been extremely rare in the United States, a treasure of fashion insiders that can fetch more than $1,000 on eBay and in vintage-book stores. But scanned images from the book have been turning up online in recent months. Ricocheting around the network of sartorially obsessed Web sites and blogs (like acontinuouslean.com and thetrad .blogspot.com), it has aroused renewed interest for its apparent prescience of preppy style. (In the United States, the word preppy came into popular use only in 1970, thanks to the best-selling book and top-grossing movie ''Love Story''; and the full flowering of preppy style would not arrive until 1980 with the best-selling ''Official Preppy Handbook.'')
 But ''Take Ivy'' was not prescient; it was totally timely, having been commissioned by Kensuke Ishizu, who was the founder of Van Jacket, an Ivy Leagueobsessed clothing line that was a sensation among Japanese teenagers and young men in the early 1960s. Mr. Ishizu was a kind of Ralph Lauren avant la lettre.
 ''You could have called it a Van look,'' recalled Daiki Suzuki, the designer and founder of Engineered Garments (channeling vintage workwear) and the designer of the revamped Woolrich Woolen Mills line (channeling 1950s New England). He remembers ''Take Ivy'' from his childhood in Japan and how the Ivy look, as it is generally called there, became basic in the '70s and '80s, as the craze for American things like Levi's and Red Wing boots accelerated. In 1989, Mr. Suzuki moved to the United States to work for a large Japanese store scouting for new American designers and obscure brands to import, like White's Boots from Washington, Russell Moccasin from Wisconsin and Duluth Pack backpacks from Minnesota.
 ''It's funny -- this authentic Americana, people in the States didn't care about it at all,'' Mr. Suzuki said. ''But I would take it back, and everybody would say, 'Wow, this is really great, what is this?' Now it's different. People here like it now.''
 HE would know. In 1999, once the Internet began eroding the specialness of his small ''Made in the USA'' finds, he founded Engineered Garments with the idea of updating vintage American pieces for modern tastes, and for five years he sold the line only in Japan. In the last couple of years Americans have come around, and now the line is a hot seller at Barneys New York.
 As curious as this American-export style of business sounds, it is not unusual. Post Overalls, a Japanese- owned line based (and made) in America since 1993, started selling here only this spring. J. Press, the venerable Ivy League clothier founded in New Haven in 1902 and bought by the Japanese fashion giant Kashiyama in 1986, has four modest stores in this country -- in Cambridge, Mass.; New Haven; New York; and Washington -- but sells roughly six times as much as American made J. Press merchandise in Japan at department stores like Isetan.
 The Japanese penchant for Americana is not merely a story of economics; it is a matter of style. It has not been unusual for Japanese men to wear the Ivy look in head-to-toe extremes once unthinkable here -- say, a blazer, tie, plaid shorts and knee socks. But given the zeal for American designers like Thom Browne and Scott Sternberg of Band of Outsiders, who tinker with old-fashioned Americana (and whose lines are made in the United States and are very popular in Japan), extremism is finally becoming fashionable here. A column in this month's GQ by a to-the-boatshoe- born Cape Codder even inveighs against the trend, labeling it a case of arrivistes going overboard. But whose Ivy look has the more valid claim?
 Mr. Suzuki remembers the first time he met Mr. Browne, when they were both starting their lines. ''He was wearing a gray suit, button-down shirt, tie, cashmere cardigan and wingtips,'' he recalled. ''I remember thinking, 'I've never seen an American dress in such Japanese style.''' Mr. Browne is flattered. ''It's amazing,'' he said. ''The Japanese get the whole perfect American thing better than Americans. They understand that it's an identifiable style around the world, this American look. We think we appreciate it, but we really don't, not like they do.''
 But that's changing. Not long ago, men scoffed at dress shorts, let alone wore them to work. Now, they are a summer norm, along with seersucker suits, ribbon belts and horn-rimmed glasses. While some men still prefer it low-key -- plain boat shoes, a faded Lacoste shirt with jeans or a khaki suit with a madras tie -- even full-on Japanese prep -- blue blazer, button-down, bermudas, loafers -- can look good if you have the attitude to carry it off.
 As fascinating and confusing as this cross-pollination is, the story of ostensible outsiders borrowing from and bettering the holy tartan has an august history. Brooks Brothers, the country's oldest operating men's clothier, and the venerable Ray-Ban brand are owned by the Italian Del Vecchio family. Erich Segal, the author of ''Love Story,'' and Lisa Birnbach, who put together ''The Official Preppy Handbook,'' are Jewish, as is Scott Sternberg of Band of Outsiders (who this week won the Council of Fashion Designers of America award for men's wear, in a tie) and, of course, the look's most famous exponent, Ralph Lauren. And, by the way, those two most prep fabrics, gingham and seersucker, came to the United States, via Britain, from India.
 Andre Benjamin, a k a Andre 3000, the designer of the bright Ivy-inspired Benjamin Bixby line (perhaps the only celebrity line with a truly fresh viewpoint), grew up in Atlanta amid the preppy boom of the '80s and early '90s. He remembers how schoolmates spent their money on clothes and cars, wearing two or three polo shirts at a time and fetishizing prepmobiles like the Volkswagen Cabriolet.
 ''I can't speak for how it's been taken up in Asian community,'' he said, ''but in the black community, you're always striving to rise above. Most black kids don't even go to college, and you just hope you can will yourself to get there.
 ''Like a lot of things, the myth is greater than the actual thing. The WASPy lifestyle, with the parents and traditions, it looks great, but appreciating it from the outside brings a whole different perspective. Ralph didn't come from it, either. It's all about having your own twist.''
 To Mr. Benjamin, the most appealing part of the old prep look was not its WASPiness but its suggestion of an easy, well-dressed freedom from anxiety, the same entitled naivete of Oliver Barrett IV, the WASPy Romeo of ''Love Story.''
 ''This golden age of Ivy League style we're talking about -- the blue blazers, the chinos, the sweatshirts, the tweed jackets -- what I like is that it's a look without looking like you thought about it. It looks like you care, but you don't care.''
 Of course, as one of the world's best and most colorfully dressed men, Mr. Benjamin cares deeply, and it shows in his clothes, as it does in all the new prep gear. And so what if it does? It may not be true of love, but as any boarding-school student can tell you, preppy means never having to say you're sorry.

HEADLINE: In Gaza, Carter Urges Hamas to Meet Terms for West's Acceptance

BYLINE: By TAGHREED EL-KHODARY and ISABEL KERSHNER; Taghreed El-Khodary reported from Gaza, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.

DATELINE: GAZA 

 BODY:
Former President Jimmy Carter said Tuesday that he urged Hamas's leaders during a high-profile meeting here to take steps necessary to become accepted by the leading Western nations.
 Mr. Carter is the most prominent American figure to have met with the Hamas government that took over Gaza two years ago, after the Palestinian Authority's forces were routed in a brief but bloody factional war. Hamas welcomed Mr. Carter's visit as a significant step in its quest for international legitimacy. 
 Ismail Haniya, the leader of the Hamas government in Gaza, and Mr. Carter held a joint news conference at which an American flag was displayed alongside a Palestinian national flag behind the speakers. There were no green Hamas flags in sight. 
 It was Mr. Haniya's most public appearance since Israel ended its devastating three-week military campaign against Hamas in Gaza in January, an offensive that Israel said was intended to halt rocket fire by Gaza militants against southern Israel.
 Striking a conciliatory tone, Mr. Haniya said Hamas would favor the creation of a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders and with full sovereignty, adding, ''We are pushing for the realization of this Palestinian national dream.'' 
 Mr. Haniya also said that Mr. Carter's visit to Gaza was particularly important after two years of economic ''siege'' and after the ''Israeli aggression.'' He noted that it followed the change in the American administration and President Obama's address in Cairo, in which Mr. Haniya said he had heard a ''different language.'' 
 Israel and Hamas declared separate, informal cease-fires that halted last winter's war, but Israel continues to impose a punishing economic blockade that allows in only basic provisions for the 1.5 million residents of the isolated coastal strip. 
 Israel, the United States and the European Union classify Hamas as a terrorist organization. They have set three conditions for dealing with Hamas, saying it must renounce all violence, recognize Israel's right to exist and accept all previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements. Hamas has so far refused to comply. 
 Hamas leaders have said they will never recognize Israel, and will offer only a long-term truce, not a full-fledged peace treaty, in return for a Palestinian state. 
 Mr. Carter, 84, emphasized that he was in Gaza as a private citizen, not as a representative of his government. But he said he would write a report on his visit to the region for the Obama administration on his return. 
 In a three-hour meeting with Hamas government officials and senior representatives of the group, Mr. Carter told them to find a mechanism that would allow Hamas to meet the conditions set by international players, according to Ahmed Yousef, the Hamas deputy foreign minister, who attended the meeting. 
 In a brief interview before the meeting, Mr. Carter said that in order to break the Israeli-Palestinian stalemate, ''first of all Hamas has to be accepted by the international community as a legitimate player in the future, and that is what I am trying to do today.'' 
 Mr. Carter also called for Palestinian unity and elections, and for an end to the economic blockade of Gaza. 
 Earlier, touring the site of the American International School, a private institution in Gaza that was bombed by the Israelis during the war, Mr. Carter said, ''I have to hold back tears when I see the deliberate destruction that has been wreaked against your people.'' He added that he felt partly responsible because the school had been ''deliberately destroyed by bombs from F-16s made in my country.''
 Israel said that rockets had been launched from the vicinity of the school. 
 Speaking at a graduation ceremony for Gazan children who had completed a human rights curriculum at the headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which aids Palestinian refugees, Mr. Carter denounced the economic embargo. 
 ''Tragically, the international community largely ignores the cries for help, while the citizens of Gaza are treated more like animals than human beings,'' he said.
 Under international pressure, the new Israeli government says it is reviewing its policy and considering allowing more goods into Gaza, but has not yet made any decisions.
 Mr. Carter, who also met leaders in Syria; the West Bank, controlled by the Palestinian Authority; and Israel during his regional tour over several days, handed the Hamas leaders in Gaza a letter from the family of Cpl. Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier who was seized and taken into Gaza in June 2006. Mr. Carter asked his hosts to pass the letter on to the soldier, presumed to be alive.
 Mr. Haniya said Hamas was hoping to negotiate an ''honorable deal'' in the form of a prisoner exchange. 
 An Israeli government official declined to comment on whether Mr. Carter could play a mediating role in such negotiations, saying the government did not speak publicly about the Shalit affair.
 Mr. Carter, who brokered the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, has fallen out of favor with many Israelis, who see him as hostile to their interests -- especially since the publication of his book ''Palestine Peace Not Apartheid'' in 2006. 
 But during this visit he met with the Israeli president, Shimon Peres, and with the speaker and members of Parliament. He also visited a Jewish settlement in the Gush Etzion settlement bloc in the West Bank. 
 In a related development on Tuesday, two Israeli groups that advocate for Palestinians, HaMoked and Gisha, revealed a new Israeli procedure that makes it impossible for Gaza residents to move to the West Bank in all but the most exceptional of cases. For example, the groups said, under the policy, chronically ill patients, orphans and elderly invalids will not be able to receive care from their closest relatives living in the West Bank if they have any relatives in Gaza capable of caring for them.
 In a paper presented to Israel's Supreme Court in reply to several petitions against the policy, the Israeli Ministry of Defense contended that it was necessary given the current security and political situation in Gaza. 
 The advocacy groups said the policy served to further isolate Gaza while increasing the geographic and political separation between Gaza and the West Bank.

HEADLINE: Another No to Federal Propping of California

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration has gone on the record again that it will not use federal stimulus money to prop up California as it wrestles with its fiscal problems.
 ''It's obviously not an easy time for the State of California,'' the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said Tuesday at a briefing after The Washington Post reported that top state officials had requested aid. ''We'll continue to monitor the challenges that they have, but this budgetary problem unfortunately is one that they're going to have to solve.'' 
 But a spokesman for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger took issue with The Post's article, which said officials had gone to the administration ''hat in hand.''
 Mr. Schwarzenegger's communications director, Mike David, said: ''We are in complete agreement with the White House that California should be solving its budgetary problems on its own without a bailout from the federal government. Governor Schwarzenegger has stressed time and again that we need to get our own fiscal house in order, and that's exactly what he has proposed to do. The governor has not asked for federal assistance to address California's fiscal crisis.''
 Mr. David's statement said the governor was working with the Legislature to find a solution to a $24.3 billion deficit. State officials have said California will run out of cash in less than 50 days. Last month, Mr. Schwarzenegger did ask for a $6 billion loan guarantee to back the state's debt. But Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, speaking to Congress, said he was skeptical that he had the authority to provide aid to the state without new legislation, a view that Mr. Gibbs echoed.
 After a series of meetings in the past few days between Mr. Geithner and White House officials, the administration concluded that the state could hold out for a while longer. 
 ''The administration will continue to monitor all aspects of the economic and fiscal challenges in California and elsewhere,'' said Jennifer Psaki, a White House spokeswoman. ''But the focus now should be on California and the tough choices that the elected officials must make to address their fiscal problems.''

CORRECTION-DATE: June 18, 2009

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the Obama administration's decision not to provide federal stimulus money to California to help it with its $24.3 billion budget deficit misstated the given name of the communications director of California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He is Matt David, not Mike.

HEADLINE: Older Recruits Challenge Army And Vice Versa

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: FORT SILL, Okla. 

 BODY:
Pfc. Shane Dixon is known as Old Dix. Specialist Jason Ness goes by Gramps. Pfc. Christopher Batson's nom de boot camp is Pops. None of them are over 40, but to the 18-year-old soldiers in basic training here, they are as ancient as a first generation Xbox. 
 Yet in the three years since the Army raised its age limit for enlisting to 42, from 35, a steady stream of older recruits has joined the ranks, pushing creaky muscles through road training, learning to appreciate -- or at least endure -- Army chow and in some cases deploying to combat zones. 
 And while the number of such recruits, more than 3,800, is small by Army standards, the pace of over-35 enlistment jumped sharply in the first months of this year. Motives vary, from a yearning for midlife adventure to a desire to serve their country. But rising unemployment is also a major reason, say Army officials, recruiters and training officers. 
 ''It's a guaranteed job, as long as you go to work every day,'' said Capt. Jared Auchey, company commander of the Army Experience Center in Philadelphia, who estimates that one in 10 of the enlistments at his high-tech marketing office are over 35. ''There are no layoffs in the Army.''
 The Army recruits about 80,000 soldiers a year, and the older recruits are having an impact even on basic training, Army officers say. At classes here, as many as one in seven soldiers are over 35, and many drill sergeants now look to the older soldiers as mentors, or proxy disciplinarians. 
 Staff Sgt. Arron Barnes, Fort Sill's drill sergeant of the year in 2009, said the older recruits tended to bring technical skills and maturity, were easier to instruct and were often more committed than teenage soldiers.
 ''They contribute at a higher level because they have no other place to go,'' Sergeant Barnes, 26, said. ''This is their life.'' 
 The older recruits are, however, injury prone. Rusty joints, forgotten injuries and slow-to-recover muscles cause the over-35 recruits to wash out of basic training at a somewhat higher rate than younger soldiers, said Lt. Col. Michael S. Patton, commander of a basic-training battalion here. 
 Specialist John D. Butts, 38, exemplifies the new breed. An aspiring writer who was a house painter outside Philadelphia for two decades, he lost his steady paycheck last November after the housing market crashed. 
 A part-time job at Blockbuster did not pay his rent, and when his landlord threatened to evict him, his girlfriend (now his wife) and her three teenage children, he decided radical action was required. He called an Army recruiter he had met recently and signed up for a three-year stint. 
 Despite years as a dedicated beer drinker and smoker, Specialist Butts made it through basic here at Fort Sill and is now training with an artillery unit that may head to South Korea this year. A tour in Afghanistan could be in the cards, he says. 
 Over the last two months, he has been yelled at by a 24-year-old drill sergeant, forced to inhale choking gas, done more push-ups than he cares to remember and patiently put up with wise-cracking 19-year-olds who forget to flush the toilet. So far, he has made the grade and is even considering a career in the military. 
 ''I've just tried to keep my head down, keep my mouth shut and not wring necks,'' Specialist Butts said.
 The sagging economy, of course, has bolstered military recruiting at all age levels. But the older recruits represent a new, and perhaps more challenging, opportunity for the Army, the only service that accepts recruits over 35. (The maximum age is 35 in the Navy, 28 in the Marine Corps and 27 in the Air Force.)
 It is not clear yet how well older soldiers handle the rigors of combat. The Army says it does not segregate older recruits in basic training and does not consider age when deciding where to assign or deploy them. Of the nearly 5,000 military personnel killed in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, about 600 have been over 35, most of them career soldiers. The oldest was 60-year-old Steven Hutchison, who served in Vietnam and retired from the Army in 1988 only to re-enlist in 2007 under a special program for retirees. Major Hutchison was killed last month in a bombing in Iraq.
 During a break in marksmanship training at Fort Sill last week, several older soldiers said the economy had not been their only motivation for enlisting. ''I didn't want to be 75 and think back, 'I wish I had joined the Army,' '' said Pvt. Mark O'Brien, 36, a corrections officer from Portsmouth, N.H. ''There's nothing worse than regret.''
 But for Private Batson, 35, the threat of layoffs was the driving force behind his joining. A mechanical engineer from Utah with five children, he was spared when his company laid off workers last year, but the close call worried him. Deciding he needed a fall-back option, he turned to the National Guard. 
 Now, if he is laid off and cannot find work, he figures he can go full time with the National Guard or the regular Army. In exchange for that job security, he says there is a good chance he will do a tour in Afghanistan. 
 ''My natural priority is my family,'' Private Batson said. ''I'll do anything I have to do to take care of them.''
 Along with the rigors of basic training, the older soldiers say the hardest thing is being away from their families for nine weeks. The second hardest thing, they say, is coping with undisciplined, couch-potato soft, video-game-obsessed teenage recruits who are, technically, their peers. 
 Private Dixon, 38, builds log houses in the Boise area but recently joined the Idaho National Guard in part because he wanted to change careers, perhaps to become a medic. He said he had been chewed out for chewing out youngsters in his platoon for what he considered slacker behavior. He was so tough on one for tromping across a newly waxed floor in his boots that the teenager broke down in tears. 
 ''I should have taken into consideration that it was a 17-year-old kid,'' Private Dixon said. ''It's not a man, not somebody that I could hold to a level of accountability. My son's 17.''

HEADLINE: The Unfortunate Location

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR

 BODY:
A WEEK after he moved into the circa-1800 farmhouse he had always dreamed of owning, David Evans spotted something glinting in his backyard. Within two hours, he had unearthed 19 spark plugs. 
 The discovery was no surprise. He knew his home had been a junkyard for the preceding 40 years -- that's one reason he bought it.
 Without the spark plugs, windshield wipers and rotting transoms that dot his garden -- as well as the not-so-appealing fact of having a trailer park and an abandoned gas station as neighbors -- Mr. Evans and his partner, Jorge Ruiz, antiques dealers in the small Lowcountry town of Walterboro, S.C., say they could never have afforded the area's oldest farmhouse. 
 When the challenging location and troubled economy drove down the seller's asking price from $296,000 to $170,000, the home was finally within reach, and a few months ago, the couple bought it. A similar house would cost 35 percent more in a different location, according to Charles H. Bridges of United Country Joe Williams & Associates, the broker who sold them the house, which is about 45 minutes west of Charleston. 
 Houses like theirs are ''the petunia in the onion patch,'' says Gary Gestson, a broker with Long & Foster Real Estate in Gaithersburg, Md. They are charming and often historic, but bargains because their neighborhoods have long since vanished or become blighted. 
 Real estate agents warn against buying a good house in an undesirable area, saying location trumps all. But because the price is often so appealing, it is a way for buyers to get some of what they want without spending a fortune. 
 As a curator of exhibitions for the New-York Historical Society, Kathleen Hulser is passionate about the past. She craved an antique home, but with her salary, she knew she would have to compromise. 
 That compromise is a freight train that blasts by just a few feet from her four-bedroom 1839 summer house on the Housatonic River in Cornwall Bridge, Conn. It appears at 7:30 a.m. almost every day. ''The house shakes,'' Ms. Hulser said. ''It rattles the pots and pans.'' She bought the house last August for $255,000, reduced from $375,000, said her broker, Priscilla Miller of Bain Real Estate, after it had been on the market for 10 months. ''Without the train next door,'' Ms. Miller said, the house would have cost double. ''It made it much more affordable by putting up with that,'' she said. 
 To make the outlay even smaller, Ms. Hulser shared the cost with her brother, Michael. The train wasn't the only factor depressing the price of the house. Next door is a former Superfund site where an old factory dumped chemicals. Ms. Hulser does not mind the toxic past because the site has been cleaned and certified by the government as fully decontaminated. 
 To Ms. Hulser, the formerly toxic site and the currently noisy train are no worse than the air and noise pollution in Harlem, where she lives during the week. Indeed, she finds the train appealing. ''The conductor always waves,'' she said. ''It almost counts as a charming defect.'' The train is not roaring through hourly; it runs on average once a day, at most twice. 
 But not everyone is charmed. Ms. Hulser said that when her 12-year-old daughter, Kira Baird, had a sleepover, she ''tried to spin it as a quaint feature of the site.'' When the train thundered by that Saturday morning, though, Ms. Hulser awoke to a chorus of pre-teens shrieking in terror. 
 Safety can be an issue. Ms. Hulser must remind her daughter's guests not to leave bicycles on the tracks, which, just 20 feet from her house, are so little used that they blend into the scenery.
 For Ms. Hulser, the historic building trumps all. ''I grew up on houses like this,'' she said. ''It's the equivalent of comfort food in architecture.'' 
 Eridania Diaz, 48, feels the same way. When she was a little girl growing up in the Dominican Republic, she sobbed when her mother replaced the family radio with a new model. ''I see new things as beautiful,'' she said, ''but they don't have that something.'' So in 2004, when her husband, Simon, a salesman, told her about the crumbling 1901 Federal-style house with a colonnaded wrap-around porch in the Highbridge section of the Bronx that he had seen when he was out on business, Ms. Diaz had to have it. 
 But the object of her affection stands among a half-dozen burned-out boarded-up shells. And Highbridge, which borders Yankee Stadium, numbers among New York City's most unsafe areas, according to statistics from the New York Police Department.
 ''When I came here I didn't notice the neighborhood,'' Ms. Diaz said. She saw only the fireplaces, each flanked by hand-carved Art Nouveau female figures, and the soaring mahogany spiral staircase that climbs toward a vaulted ceiling. 
 ''We were able to get the house because of the neighborhood,'' said her daughter, Erika, who lives there with her family. ''This house in another neighborhood, we wouldn't be able to afford.'' They paid $350,000 for the 10-room house in 2004. It cost about that much to haul away over 10 tons of trash, remodel and install surveillance cameras and alarms. 
 Though she said she loves the house, Ms. Diaz, who is a landlord, recently put it on the market because she said that economic troubles had left many of her tenants unable to pay their rent, which has reduced her income. She said she plans to move into a similar antique house a few streets away if she sells the property.
 For Kevin Miske, 38, who lives alone, indulging his love of old buildings by buying one in a neighborhood he could afford has worked out. He paid $675,000 for a 9,000-square-foot home plus a 1,000-square-foot coach house -- significantly less than the $1.1-million asking price. 
 But just after he closed in 2004 on the turn-of-the-century two-story town house on the seedy side of the Garfield Park neighborhood of Chicago, thieves broke in. 
 Mr. Miske bought a second dog. ''I needed something intimidating,'' said Mr. Miske of the 160-pound South African mastiff that now patrols his yard. ''He's a very gentle dog, but visually he's intimidating.'' 
 He feels safe, but drug deals and prostitution are part of the neighborhood landscape. ''If I had a family I would perhaps think differently,'' he said. ''If I was worried about the security of my wife and children, I wouldn't do this.''
 Sometimes safety is in the eye of the beholder. When Gwynn Griffith first invited her girlfriends to her new home on the south side of the river in San Antonio for their weekly card game, they carpooled. They were afraid, she said, of a drive-by shooting. 
 Her home, a shoe manufacturing plant built in the 1800s, cost $80,000 in 1994, and Ms. Griffith, a decorator with an opulent flair, has spent $400,000 creating a lavish space that conjures a ruined European castle. 
 Not all improvements are aesthetic: She's spent nearly $7,000 on stockade fencing alone. ''I've kind of made a fortress out of it because of the neighborhood,'' she says. When she's inside the three-story, 16,000-square-foot factory, towering over a sea of tiny, shabby buildings, Ms. Griffith says she feels transported. 
 She says she has never felt unsafe in her palazzo-like enclave, although she hears gunshots some evenings. ''I have a more desirable building in just a less desirable area,'' she said. 
 Skeptics are won over by what Ms. Griffith has done, said Chris Hill, a friend and real estate developer. ''You do kind of wonder when you stop to buy beer on the way at all the bulletproof glass 'round the gasstation down the street,'' he said, ''but once you get there, you forget all about that.''
 When she first saw the property, there were old boats and rusted cars in the yard, pigeons roosting indoors and a resident colony of bats. ''They'd swoop in and fly around and eat all the mosquitoes,'' she said. ''I thought it was kind of charming.''
 Like many people who own houses where the location is unlikely to improve, Ms. Griffith will probably never see a return on her investment. Because that is often a risk, Marjorie Ellena, a co-owner of HistoricProperties.com, a real estate listing service for antique homes, warns buyers away from such properties. 
 But emotional reactions can be powerful. Anne Troutman, 53, found the desire for a taste of her New England birthplace in Santa Monica, Calif., so strong that five years ago she bought a church that reminded her of the architecture of her childhood. Then she turned it into a residence despite the fact that a homeless couple was, according to Ms. Troutman, ''bivouacked in the side yard.'' 
 Though at just over $1 million the house wasn't cheap, many comparable area homes are currently listed at more than double that price. That's because while the property sits two blocks from the sea, it's sandwiched between a day care center and a community center that also runs children's programs. (The sound of children playing, she said, is ''stereophonic.'') Substance abusers come to the center for nightly support groups and congregate around her yard. Some mornings she wakes to find someone passed out on her doorstep. 
 Because of the location and the run-down condition of the church, Ms. Troutman paid a third less than the asking price. 
 Ms. Troutman, an artist and former architecture professor, and her husband, Aleks Istanbullu, 59, an architect, made an oral agreement with the homeless couple living in the yard: they stayed on as guardians of the vacant house until construction was complete, after which, they left -- sort of. ''They used to come back for weekends at the beach,'' Ms. Troutman said.
 Some did not approve. Ms. Troutman's father, Richard Troutman, was unsettled by the homeless people and addicts camping out around the building. ''It's not exactly reassuring when you have a daughter who's maybe alone in the house,'' he said. But the lofty ceilings, and the couple's deft renovations, he said, have since won him over.
 Ms. Troutman said she has come to see the neighborhood not as a blight but rather as something that connects her to reality. ''In L.A. especially, you can pick your perfect house and perfect neighborhood and find that you are completely divorced from real life,'' she said. In contrast, her home ''is knitted into the community and all of its complexities.'' 
 It takes a certain personality to give up ''location, location, location'' for ''house, house, house.'' Mr. Evans, whose professional world is antiques, grew up in a ''cookie-cutter house'' in Middletown, N.J., by the Jersey Shore. To him the sameness of modern houses is an anathema -- so much so that he's willing to put up with the beer bottles and candy wrappers that crop up like crab grass on the lawn, and the constant whiz of cars along the road that passes very close to his house. 
 Would he prefer if his home were in a nicer locale? 
 ''I would also love to be 6'3'' and muscled,'' he said, ''but I'm not, and not going to be. And eventually we'll dig up all the spark plugs.'' 
 In the meantime, he said, ''It's kind of a funny cocktail party conversation.''

HEADLINE: Making Ends Meet by Way of Rubbish

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
Consider home-related reality TV shows as an economic barometer: in the fizzy sub-prime era, get-rich programs like A & E's ''Flip This House'' and Bravo's ''Million Dollar Listing'' filled the airwaves. Now there are more recession-appropriate shows, among them DIY's ''Operation Salvage,'' which follows the Whites, a Barnegat, N.J., family whose members run an architectural salvage business called Recycling the Past and spend their free time on thrifty projects like making dining tables out of scrap wood. 
 Matt White, who works alongside his brother, Josh, and his father, Steve, took a break from his seven-day workweek to chat. 
 How do you differentiate between junk and something valuable?
 Nothing is junk. But often you get called last minute and have 24 hours to get everything out of a house. You have to focus on the best investment for your time.
 Like what?
 Old-growth wood, for example. Years ago, chestnut trees were killed in a blight, so the only way to get that wood today is with salvage materials.
 Do you salvage big items, too?
 We took four 40-foot-tall limestone columns from a nursing college in New Jersey. People say, ''Why did you bother with that?'' Well, who else has got it? I don't care if I sell them or not. It makes our yard look great. 
 Has the recession affected your business?
 Things are tight, but people still want to work on their homes. To get a custom door built might run you $500 to $3,000. You can get that from us for maybe $75. 
 Did you use salvage in your home?
 We brought in stained glass from a house in Westchester. The flooring came from a barn in the Shenandoah Valley. The sink is from a house in St. Louis. The countertops are railroad car floorings. Walking around the house, there are so many stories.

HEADLINE: Thriving on Mexican-American Market

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN. 
This column about small-business trends in California and the West appears on the third Thursday of every month. E-mail: jamesflanigan@nytimes.com

 BODY:
MEXICO'S economy has suffered a series of blows in recent months -- drug violence, swine flu and the worldwide economic downturn. Yet some companies on each side of the border with the United States are prospering because they serve the expanding Mexican-American market in the United States. 
 A new economy is emerging that builds on the economic relationship between the countries. Exports and imports between Mexico and the United States have grown rapidly in the last decade, to close to $400 billion annually. And now trade is taking on new complexity, with operations in Southern California sometimes serving as Mexico's link to the global economy. 
 Viz Cattle Corporation, for example, the American division of Mexico's SuKarne Global, handles exports of Mexican beef to Japan and South Korea, through contracts made in Compton, Calif. The beef originates in SuKarne's home base in Culiacan, Sinaloa, in northwest Mexico. ''Japanese and Korean executives buy here, and they go to inspect the ranches in Mexico, too,'' said Jesus Tarriba, manager of Viz Cattle's warehouse operation in Compton, in southeast Los Angeles County. ''Last year we sold $40 million of beef to Japan and Korea and $80 million here in the U.S.''
 Viz Cattle has grown rapidly, from less than $10 million in revenue five years ago to $120 million in 2008. And it is doing well this year despite the downturn, Mr. Tarriba said. Its main business is importing beef from Mexico for American restaurants and retailers. ''We specialize in smaller cuts of rib-eye and strip steaks because Mexican ranches slaughter livestock at younger ages than American ranches,'' Mr. Tarriba said. ''Restaurants like those cuts.'' 
 Viz Cattle and other food companies on the border have also capitalized on the expanding Latino population across the United States and the changing tastes of the public. 
 ''Chipotle was unknown here five years ago,'' Marcelo Sada, president of Source Logistics Center Corporation, said of the smoked jalapeno pepper in many Mexican foods and sauces. Mr. Sada's company, based in Montebello, Calif., imports bakery and soft drink products from Mexico.
 Martinez Brands/Tequila Holdings Inc., from Pasadena, Calif., has also been a beneficiary of the growing American taste for Mexican products. ''Tequila is the fastest growing liquor variety in the United States for the last seven years,'' said Javier Martinez, president of Martinez Brands. ''And why? Because young Americans vacation in Mexico and associate tequila with fun, freedom and friendship.''
 Business is good as well, for Inter-Con Security Systems, a company also based in Pasadena, that protects State Department installations in the United States and abroad as well as private businesses, hospitals and sports arenas, said Carlo Gobelli, who leads Mexican operations. ''Security is in very great demand, to guard executives and company operations and also shipments of goods,'' Mr. Gobelli said.. 
 Inter-Con employs 6,500 people in Mexico; the company has 30,000 employees over all. ''A new concern here,'' Mr. Gobelli said, ''is that we are getting demands to protect pharmaceutical laboratories against theft of key ingredients that drug gangs can use.''
 Still, some companies are seeing a more mixed picture. ICS Group Inc. of Rolling Hills Estates, in southwest Los Angeles County, represents Carlisle Companies' roofing and building products in Mexico and Latin America, said, ''Right now, American companies are holding back from investing in Mexico and are not sending their personnel because of dangers from the drug wars,'' said Mark Aston, the president of ICS. 
 But he credited business in the Caribbean with helping the company's annual revenues grow to an estimated $15 million this year from $300,000 in 2004. ''Mexican business people and investors are confident that when this recession ends, Mexico will do well again,'' he said. 
 Mr. Gobelli and other Mexican executives generally agreed that the economy's overall outlook was positive. ''The businessmen say, 'This crisis did not start here in Mexico' as have so many crises in the past. It started in the U.S. and the world,'' Mr. Gobelli said. ''Therefore, they say, when the U.S. and the world recover, Mexico will too.'' 
 Meanwhile, the slow American economy and moves to control illegal immigration with increased border patrols and raids on domestic job sites have reduced migration from Mexico. So remittances to families in Mexico from people working in the United States have declined sharply in the last year. But the Latino population in the United States has grown as a result of children born to immigrants in recent decades. That Latino population is 45 million, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. 
 This has led to more online commerce with Mexico and other shifts in the marketplace, said Hector Orci, co-founder of La Agencia de Orci, an advertising agency in Los Angeles. ''For example, Liverpool department stores in Mexico sell online to people here and the goods can be delivered to their mother living in Mexico,'' Mr. Orci said. 
 Spanish-language media is also shifting to more use of English language commercials and programs, he said. So Mr. Orci is building a new division of his agency, called One Plus Two, for the population that speaks English but enjoys Spanish language programming like telenovelas from Mexico. 
 ''Online use is very high among Latinos, maybe 20 million people using broadband Internet,'' said Michele Ruiz, a former television anchorwoman who started the Saber Hacer (to know, to do) Web site in 2007. The site offers advice to Latinos on such subjects as parenting, personal finance, health and medicine and college preparation. 
 Ms. Ruiz said she had raised $700,000 to start the Web site and investors have now put in ''several million more.'' The site has close to 200,000 visitors, Ms. Ruiz said, and she is looking to private equity funds and other investors to raise an additional $5 million. 
 She wants to expand the Web site's reach and content, which includes presentations in English or Spanish on the importance of annual mammograms, on how to write resumes and apply for positions and how to talk to your doctor or your children about sex. ''We understand the culture and how people think,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Banks Brace for Fight Over an Agency Meant to Bolster Consumer Protection

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN and LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
When the economy was booming, banks doled out credit to consumers like candy. People who could never afford to live their dream found pay option adjustable rate mortgages and other easy-access loans just a signature away. Credit cards put the pain of payment off to another day -- never mind the fees hidden in the fine print.
 On Wednesday, President Obama proposed creating a federal agency that would require banks, mortgage lenders and credit card companies to provide consumers with a more nutritious diet, financially speaking. 
 But what is good for consumers may not always square with what is good for banks. And the banking industry -- which says it stands to lose billions of dollars -- is bracing for a fight as the administration's plan to overhaul the way the industry is regulated heads to Capitol Hill. 
 Banks ''are really dumbfounded by the scope of this agency,'' Edward L. Yingling, the president of the American Bankers Association, said. ''It's not like the current regulators don't have all the authority they need. You don't have to blow up the system.'' 
 The Consumer Financial Protection Agency is the brainchild of Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor who has come to prominence on consumer matters after years of studying the rising toll of consumer debt. She argues that the banking regulators have an inherent conflict of interest between ensuring the safety and soundness of institutions and protecting consumers. 
 If the administration gets its way, the agency, a sort of Food and Drug Administration for financial products, would be empowered to tell banks to tidy up their offerings and make sure consumers have the information they need to make sound financial decisions, while being protected from scams. 
 It could, among other things, dictate standards for some products before banks could bring them to market, and push banks to favor plain vanilla loans over more exotic home loans, which could be required to carry warnings. Unfair terms and practices among credit card issuers would also be weeded out. 
 If Congress approved the agency, it would be the first time that consumers would have a seat at the banking regulatory table. 
 ''The argument for doing that is you'll have an agency that's only focused on protecting consumers,'' said Donald G. Ogilvie, chairman of the Deloitte Center for Banking Solutions. ''The argument against that is you'll have an agency that's only interested in protecting consumers.''
 But it also sets up a potential turf battle among the myriad agencies that are currently tasked with protecting consumers, including the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, which the banks would like to see maintain this oversight. 
 Banking groups are concerned about the costs a new layer of regulation might impose, and the prospect of more examiners crowding into their banks. 
 ''You are talking about an agency that is authorized to design financial products and, in fact, say that they must be offered first, over the banks' own products,'' said Mr. Yingling. 
 In an interview on Wednesday, Ms. Warren said the new agency could have implications beyond consumer protection. Protecting consumers from risky products ultimately protects the entire financial system, she argued. 
 ''This crisis started one mortgage at a time,'' said Ms. Warren, who, as the chairwoman of the Congressional panel that oversees government spending on the financial bailout, has the ear of many lawmakers. ''The bad products that were sold household by household not only destabilized families. When they were sliced and diced and passed along through mortgage-backed securities, they magnified risk throughout the economy.''
 The agency would most likely be harder on banks that profited from high-risk products, Ms. Warren said. But it may benefit banks that offer more consumer-friendly products that are ''lost in the storm of advertising'' for riskier products, she said.
 While banks will lobby to water down the agency's proposed powers in Congress, the devil will be in the details. One important question is how the agency would be financed. A spokesman for the Treasury said it would be paid for in part through ''fees assessed on entities and transactions across the financial sector.'' While he was not more specific, there could be conflicts of interest if, for example, banks paid fees directly to the agency to seek approval for their products. 
 Another issue will be the division between state and federal power. State attorneys general have often cracked down on mortgage fraud, high credit card rates, payday lending and other consumer financial protection issues that the new agency would take up. Mr. Yingling, of the American Bankers Association, expressed concern that financial companies might receive uneven treatment at the state and national level.
 It may also be difficult to separate ''consumers'' from ''investors,'' leaving uncertainty about whether some financial products fall under the purview of the new agency or the Securities and Exchange Commission, which monitors many investor products. A spokesman for the Treasury said the S.E.C. would maintain its power over investor protection.
 The president's proposal resembles legislation introduced a few months ago by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. He acknowledged the idea of an agency faced a fight on Capitol Hill.
 ''Never underestimate the banks,'' he said.

HEADLINE: FedEx Posts Quarterly Loss of $876 Million

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
FedEx, the shipping company, posted a loss of $876 million in the quarter as consumers and businesses sent fewer packages and the company took more than $1 billion in one-time charges. 
 FedEx said it expected a rough ride for some time.
 ''The operating environment for our first two quarters in fiscal 2010 is expected to be extremely difficult,'' the chief financial officer, Alan B. Graf Jr., said.
 FedEx lost $876 million, or $2.82 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended May 31, compared with a loss of $241 million, or 78 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, earnings were 64 cents a share.
 The company took a $900 million write-down related to the 2004 purchase of Kinko's -- now known as FedEx Office -- and $90 million in charges related to a September 2006 acquisition of a trucking company and its affiliates. It also took charges for employee severance and facility cutbacks.
 Revenue in the period fell 20 percent, to $7.85 billion from $9.87 billion.
 Shares of FedEx, which is based in Memphis, fell 72 cents, to $50.70.
 FedEx predicted earnings in the current quarter would drop sharply from a year ago. The company expects a profit of 30 cents to 45 cents a share for the period ending in August, compared with earnings of $1.23 a share a year ago.
 Mr. Graf said that sluggish manufacturing and another run-up in fuel prices would hold back earnings. 
 Fourth-quarter revenue for the FedEx Express unit dropped 25 percent as the unit moved fewer packages and fuel prices rose. In the freight segment, revenue fell 28 percent. The company's ground segment did relatively well, with revenue down only about 1 percent from a year ago. That unit was helped by DHL's exiting the domestic package market and from a delivery partnership with the United States Postal Service.
 FedEx said that international package volumes improved in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. The company hopes that means the global economy slowdown is leveling off.

HEADLINE: Slight Rise for Consumer Prices in May

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Despite rising gasoline prices, overall retail prices in the United States barely budged in May, the government reported on Wednesday.
 The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.1 percent last month after being unchanged in April. The index measures how much consumers spend on an array of goods and services, and is considered a gauge of inflation in the economy. 
 As the government borrows hundreds of billions of dollars to finance its bailouts and lending programs, some investors have grown leery about inflation. Prices of commodities like gold, copper and crude oil have climbed, and interest rates on government bonds have risen to their highest levels in five months, reflecting concern that prices were rising.
 Some investors even speculated that the Federal Reserve might need to raise its target interest rates, which are currently near zero. But Fed governors have given no indication that they would raise rates anytime soon.
 Economists pointed to Wednesday's numbers as a sign that there was still widespread downward pressure on prices, even if federal debts were growing. Wage growth is slowing, unemployment is rising, consumer demand remains low and many industries are still running at partial capacity.
 ''Slack is headed to near unprecedented territory here,'' a United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, Haseeb Ahmed, said. ''If wages are falling, do you really expect people to believe inflation's going to go through the roof next year?''
 Consumer prices fell 1.3 percent from a year ago, the largest drop since 1950. The decline reflects a sharp drop in the prices of transportation and energy from last spring.
 In May, consumers paid less for food and beverages, clothing and housing. The prices of fruits and vegetables fell 1 percent, meat and poultry prices fell 0.9 percent, and prices of dairy and cooking oil were lower. 
 The cost of transportation and energy edged up as the prices of crude oil and gasoline increased, largely on signs of a pickup in the global economy and concern that government recovery policies would lead to inflation. Gasoline prices rose a seasonally adjusted 3.1 percent in May, but were still down 39.4 percent from the period a year ago.
 The average price of a gallon of gasoline rose to $2.68 on Wednesday, according to AAA's Fuel Gauge Report, up from $2.31 a month ago. But that is still lower than the $4 a gallon drivers paid last summer as oil peaked at about $145 a barrel, shortly before prices collapsed amid the financial crisis.
 The so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 0.1 percent for the month, its smallest increase since December.
 In a second report, the Commerce Department said the current account trade deficit declined to $101.5 billion in the first quarter, a 34.5 percent drop from the fourth quarter, as trade continued to ease because of the recession. The current account is the broadest measure of trade available, covering goods and services as well as investment flows between countries.

HEADLINE: Eddie Bauer Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Eddie Bauer, the outdoor-clothing chain that sold goose-down coats to Mount Everest mountaineers and college students alike, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Wednesday and said it planned to sell itself for $202 million to CCMP Capital Advisors, a private equity firm.
 The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in Delaware, and said that Bank of America, GE Capital and the CIT Group have agreed to provide up to $100 million in financing during the bankruptcy case. 
 Eddie Bauer, which has 371 stores in North America, is pursuing a sale to CCMP through what is known as a 363 sale process in bankruptcy court. A judge would need to approve the sale, and other potential bidders could emerge. 
 CCMP, as a so-called stalking horse bidder, is entitled to a $5 million breakup fee if it loses during the court-supervised auction process.
 ''We're not looking to liquidate the company or close most of the stores,'' said Jonathan Lynch, a CCMP managing director. ''We're trying to help 8,000 employees save an iconic American brand.'' 
 The retailer said its stores, catalog business and Web sites would continue operating, and that it intended to honor customer gift cards, returns and loyalty program points.
 Eddie Bauer is the latest apparel chain to file for bankruptcy protection in recent months, along with Mervyn's, Steve & Barry's, Goody's and Gottschalk's. 
 Eddie Bauer was struggling to repay its debt after consumers stopped spending on anything but necessities. The falloff in sales came as Eddie Bauer was trying to pull off a multiyear turnaround that included cost cuts, as well as changes to its management team and its merchandise. 
 ''Eddie Bauer is a good company with a great brand and a bad balance sheet,'' Neil Fiske, the company's chief executive, said in a statement. ''This process will allow the business to emerge with far less debt, positioned for growth as the economy recovers and as our new products gain traction. We expect this process to be completed very quickly, protecting our employees and critical vendor partners every step of the way.''
 Shares of Eddie Bauer Holdings had been trading for about 25 cents since last week. 
 For the three months ended April 4, Eddie Bauer's loss increased to $44.5 million, or $1.44 a share from $19.3 million, or 63 cents, a year earlier. Sales at full-price and outlet stores open at least a year declined 13.7 percent, in contrast to a 0.5 percent increase a year earlier. (Sales were hurt in part by Canadian exchange rates.) On top of the sales declines, the company had $427 million in debt and was struggling in the tight credit market. 
 In a court filing, the company said its debt load was a result of loans it took on when its onetime parent company, Spiegel, filed for bankruptcy in 2003. Eddie Bauer took on $300 million in debt, as well as Spiegel's benefits and pension plans. The retailer said that about 50 percent of its earnings now go toward paying down that debt.
 Even after cutting costs as part of its turnaround, Eddie Bauer made additional reductions. In January, it cut about 15 percent of its nonretail staff. The chain said it would also freeze salaries, limit its capital spending to about $15 million, rethink some benefits programs, reduce the size of its board and the board's compensation, and lower Mr. Fiske's salary by 10 percent for the rest of the year. 
 Eddie Bauer's proposed buyer, CCMP, is a middle-market private equity firm that once served as a buyout arm of JPMorgan Chase. Last year, it hired Greg Brenneman, who helped fix Burger King and Continental Airlines, as its chairman.
 CCMP first took a look at Eddie Bauer in 2004, but was dissuaded from making an investment because the company was then focused on becoming a women's casual apparel chain, along the lines of J. Jill or Talbots. 
 ''When we looked at it in 2004, we thought management was taking it in the wrong direction,'' Mr. Lynch of CCMP said. ''Frankly, it had lost its way.''
 But a new management team led by Mr. Fiske began returning the company, founded in Seattle in 1920, back toward its outdoor adventure roots. (After nearly freezing to death during a hunting trip in the 1930s, the founder, Eddie Bauer, designed and eventually patented a quilted goose-down jacket.) 
 Advisers to Eddie Bauer reached out again to CCMP about a potential investment earlier this year. CCMP said it planned to support Mr. Fiske and his management team, and was seeking to keep most of the company's stores and employees. 
 ''Roll forward to where we are today,'' Mr. Lynch said, ''the business is under new leadership that's doing all the right things.'' 
 Eddie Bauer celebrated a new line called First Ascent last month by outfitting two mountaineers as they took on Mount Everest: Ed Viesturs (who has made a habit of climbing 8,000-meter peaks without bottled oxygen) and Peter Whittaker, the nephew of Jim Whittaker, who was also wearing Eddie Bauer when he became the first American to successfully reach the summit of Mount Everest in 1963. 
 ''This is a milestone for us,'' Mr. Fiske said in a statement last month. ''It puts us literally back on top of the world.''

HEADLINE: Major Military Academies Report Significant Rise in Applicants

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
The nation's three major military academies said Wednesday that applications for the incoming Class of 2013 were up significantly from previous years, citing aggressive marketing, declining casualties in Iraq and the economic downturn as factors.
 The rise in applications was most notable at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., where applications reached their highest level since 1988, 15,342, up 40 percent from the class of 2012. About 1,240 are expected to enroll.
 Applications were also up at the Military Academy at West Point, where 11,106 people applied for about 1,320 places in the incoming class, an increase of 9.6 percent. And at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, 9,890 people applied for about 1,350 places, an increase of just under 10 percent. 
 In a year when layoffs and shrinking paychecks dominated many families' thoughts about college, officials at the military academies acknowledged that the recession might have encouraged some students to apply. Not only are tuition and room and board completely covered at the academies, but students also receive stipends that total thousands of dollars a year.
 But those officials also said that students tended to have very personal reasons for applying to the military academies -- patriotism, an abiding interest in the military as a profession or a desire to follow a parent's footsteps among them -- and that therefore the economy alone could not explain the upswing in applications.
 ''You find in most of the people who apply, this is a process that starts several years in advance,'' said Cmdr. Joe Carpenter, a spokesman for the Naval Academy. ''The process itself is much more involved and lengthy, and often involves a Congressional nomination, which is not something you do on a whim.''
 Commander Carpenter and officials from the other academies pointed to intensified marketing campaigns in recent years that they say played a major role in increasing the application pool. 
 The Military Academy, for instance, for the first time bought billboard space at airports in Los Angeles, Dallas-Forth Worth and Atlanta and Dulles airport near Washington during the holiday season last year, said Col. Deborah McDonald, director of admissions. 
 Colonel McDonald said her office had also expanded its efforts to stay in touch with potential candidates via letters and e-mail messages, and worked more closely with members of Congress to help them with the process of nominating applicants. 
 Commander Carpenter said that the Naval Academy began expanding its recruiting in urban areas, including New York, two years ago, and that the effort had begun to pay off, not only in more applicants from those areas, but also more minority applicants. Applications from minority students were up by 57 percent this year over last, he said. 
 The number of applicants to West Point was the highest in at least several years, but was slightly lower than the period immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when interest in all the military academies surged. In those years, applications to West Point rose over 12,000. But while the numbers have crept back down in the last four years, they remain higher than before the attacks, she said. 
 At the Air Force Academy, applications were at their highest point in five years, said John Van Winkle, the deputy chief of media relations for the academy. 
 The recession has also clearly benefited military recruiting this year, including for the Army, which had struggled to meet its quotas in some recent years. 
 The rise in applications at the military academies, which was reported this week by The Associated Press, is similar to the trend at many well-known public colleges, reflecting perhaps their lower cost. The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; and the University of Virginia, Charlottesville; all reported higher application numbers this year. But so did a number of elite colleges, including Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Dartmouth and Brown.
 The drawdown of American forces in Iraq, combined with fewer casualties there, may have also contributed to easing some parents' concerns about having their children attend West Point, Colonel McDonald said. The Army has sustained by far the most casualties in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 But Commander Carpenter noted that interest in the Marine Corps among Naval Academy students has been on the rise in recent years, even though Marines represent the second-largest group of casualties in those wars.

HEADLINE: Opportunity For Second Act On Long Island

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: MINEOLA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 Back when the potato fields turned into tract houses, Long Island became Long Island and suburbia became suburbia 60 years ago, a best-case scenario might have been a week just like this one, with flocks of golf-inclined pilgrims descending on Bethpage State Park for the United States Open.
 What would have seemed a lot less likely would have been the seven-year game of three-dimensional chess now coming to a head about seven miles away. It is basically asking whether there's a vision of suburbia beyond single-family homes, clogged highways and high-end golf, and if so, whether it can take hold on Long Island. 
 It sounds like a lot of significance to put on one development, however big -- and, even taken with a few shakers of salt, the projected $4 billion in investment, the 5.5 million square feet of mixed-use development, the 75,000 construction and secondary jobs and 19,000 permanent jobs claimed for the project, the Lighthouse at Long Island, qualify as suitably big.
 The project, as proposed for 150 acres in the heart of Nassau County, includes a renovated Nassau Coliseum, 2,300 residences including two hotel and residential towers nearly 40 stories tall, canal and pedestrian plaza, sports complex and sports technology center, convention center, office buildings -- in effect, the first ambitious urban space in a county that developed as a rejection of exactly that.
 So with Long Island having given birth to the modern suburbs in the days of Robert Moses and Levittown, what happens with the Lighthouse could go a long way to answering whether the island has a second act or just an increasingly embattled version of the first.
 Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, who touts the Lighthouse as the centerpiece of his vision of a smart-growth, new suburbia, always begins his sales pitch for the project and the idea behind it by saying it's not a threat to the Long Island of myth and fable.
 Ninety percent of the county will stay the same! We love our single-family homes, beaches and waterfronts! It's not about becoming the sixth borough!
 ''We don't want to be postsuburban,'' he says. ''We don't want to be a new urbanism. We want to be a new suburbia. We want to keep the good stuff about suburbia and get rid of the bad stuff about suburbia. But the old model of suburbia began 60 years ago with Levittown. It's no longer sustainable.''
 In truth, Mr. Suozzi's gospel of New Suburbia, a combination of what he calls cool downtowns -- somewhat loosely defined -- and a megaproject like this, isn't completely new. You need only to go as far as White Plains or Stamford, Conn., or New Rochelle to find ''smart growth'' urban models in the middle of distinctly suburban environments. The problem for Mr. Suozzi is that there's almost none of it on Long Island. Nassau County's population is smaller now than it was in 1970, it's pretty much out of developable land and facing high taxes, stagnant revenues and the exodus of young people. 
 It's not like the Lighthouse will save Long Island, but it's by far the biggest thing to have come along in decades. 
 Still, good luck in getting it done. Long Islanders are expert in stopping anything. The Republicans who run the Town of Hempstead and the Democrats who run Nassau County have a vested interest in making sure the others don't succeed. In a region where the DNA is suspicious of anything urban, Charles Wang, Islanders owner and project sponsor, didn't help his case by first announcing an Ozymandian 60-story tower as the centerpiece.
 On the other hand, county and town officials have actually been talking to one another and showing some sense of urgency about moving it along. Mr. Wang says he needs an answer on the project by October or he will entertain proposals to move the team, so something has to give before long.
 Things could still fall apart or the project could get approved and then flop (hello, Xanadu). But oddly, the criticism thus far has been pretty muted, perhaps a sign that people realize that, particularly in this miserable economy, Nassau desperately needs a second act, and this may be the only game in town.
 ''It's potentially a game changer, and after this, there's nothing else,'' said Lawrence Levy, executive director of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University. ''This is a region that hasn't been able to get much done in a long time, and this would show that it could. And you think, if they can't do this, they can't do anything.''

HEADLINE: Fashion First, Whatever the Size

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
BETH DITTO was livid. Topshop, the fast-fashion chain, had approached Ms. Ditto, the outsize lead singer with the punk band Gossip, and a favorite mascot of the fashion world, to perform at its flagship store in London. Blowups of her heart-shaped face and rotund form would be on display. 
 But Ms. Ditto, who happily flaunts what the British like to call her ''wobbly bits,'' was having none of it. ''I don't think it's fair to put my face somewhere where they would never let me in there to wear their clothes,'' she complained on a blog. If the chain hoped to capitalize on her grooviness, she wrote, why not accord her the same status it does Kate Moss, and let her create a ''big girl'' line for Topshop. 
 ''Give me the job,'' Ms. Ditto demanded. ''I want to design.'' 
 Her message, flung down like a gauntlet, reached the ears of the Arcadia Group, the parent company of Topshop. This month, a couple of years after Ms. Ditto's sound off, Arcadia plans to unveil a collection that Ms. Ditto designed for Evans, the company's plus-size division. Available in the United States on the Web, it highlights cutting-edge looks like a corset dress and a cropped biker jacket. 
 The collection is the latest in an outpouring of fashions aimed at trend-driven, round-figured teenagers and young women, a population that has long echoed Ms. Ditto's complaint that it is ignored by most merchants and brands. 
 ''Up to now it's been difficult to provide adequate fashion content to a large-sized customer,'' said Jeff Van Sinderen, a retail analyst at B. Riley, a research and investment firm. The woman of size, as she is euphemistically known, ''still wants to wear the same clothes as her slimmer counterparts,'' he added.
 Other stores and designers have picked up the message. Forever 21, a purveyor of cheap chic, introduced its plus-size line, Faith 21, this spring. Target recently began offering Pure Energy, exuberantly patterned dresses and tops for young women. Those follow hip niche labels like Karen Kane and Kiyonna, which are sold at boutiques. 
 All the lines see potential profit in offering stylish alternatives to the ubiquitous track suit. From a business perspective, that makes sense: the customer base is increasing, as health authorities have long pointed out. Some 17 percent of teenagers are overweight, according to the surgeon general's office, more than three times the rate of a generation ago. 
 The market for youth-oriented plus sizes (usually 14 to 24) showed strong growth a couple of years ago, several years after the fast-fashion chain H&M entered the business. (H&M has since dropped its plus-size line, for reasons it would not disclose.)
 Last year, sales of plus sizes to girls and young women ages 13 to 34 reached $5.8 billion, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. 
 With consumer spending falling everywhere, that momentum has been lost: Sales declined 15.3 percent for plus-size shoppers 13 to 17 and 10.1 percent for those 18 to 34 in April and May, compared with the period a year ago, NPD says.
 Plus-size lines aimed at older women have also suffered; chains including Ann Taylor and Old Navy have removed larger sizes from stores (they still sell them online).
 Despite the slump, some see the market inevitably returning to strength. ''The fact that more businesses are getting into this market is a clear indication that the recent lack of growth has been more about the economy than about a lack of interest,'' said Marshal Cohen, an NPD analyst. 
 Faith 21 was introduced ''because our customers were asking for larger sizes, and to fill a void in the market for trendy and fashionable plus-size clothing,'' said Linda Chang, the senior manager of marketing for Forever 21. It includes some 250 styles. 
 Smaller stores are also catering to shoppers who want figure-hugging fashions like their thinner friends. ''Some of those girls feel like they have the brio to pull off a fitted look,'' said Stephanie Sack, the owner of Vive la Femme, a plus-size boutique on fashionable Damen Avenue in Chicago. She confided that when she was 20, ''I would have choked somebody to get my hand on a studded belt to fit me.''
 She might find updated versions of that belt today at Torrid, a division of the youth-oriented Hot Topic chain, which began offering moderately priced, rock-influenced looks to young women nearly a decade ago. Or at Fat Fancy, a new boutique in Portland, Ore., that sells vintage and current styles in sizes up to 24. 
 ''When you're fat you stand out anyway,'' said Annie Maribona, the shop's founder and part owner. ''It's really important to go all the way and do something fun or even outrageous with your clothes.''
 Stores as diverse as Kmart and Lord & Taylor have dispensed with conventional big girls' ''dos and don'ts,'' offering the hothouse colors and exuberant prints, the ruffles and flounces of their so-called straight-size counterparts. Even horizontal stripes, once a fashion sin for the overweight, animate some looks in Kmart's Piper & Blue collection.
 ''I've noticed lately that they are trying to make big sizes more into style,'' said Kathy Salinas, as she considered a zebra-striped Piper & Blue tunic at a Kmart in downtown Manhattan this week. ''You see that at regular stores, not just the plus-size stores, and that's a good thing.'' 
 Round-figured young women have found inspiration in popular culture. Ms. Ditto, who settled her girth on tiny gilt chairs at some 10 fashion shows this year, along with the actress Jennifer Hudson and the singer Adele, all appear in full-figured glory in the current issue of Elle. 
 The glamorously curvy Jordin Sparks captivated viewers on ''American Idol,'' then moved on to a recording career. On Stylista, a reality show on the CW network last fall, a curvy contestant named Danielle competed for a job as a junior editor at Elle. 
 More than tokenism, such fashion and media tactics seem born of a conviction that larger young women have become more self-accepting. ''They are inclined to show off the parts of their bodies they love,'' said Ms. Sack, the Chicago retailer. Pushing the trend is a broad movement of fat acceptance among academics, anti-bias activists and some psychologists. ''It's important to reclaim 'fat' as a descriptive, as even something positive,'' argued Ms. Maribona of Fat Fancy. 
 But others point to serious health consequences of being overweight. Andrea Marks, a specialist in adolescent medicine in Manhattan, suspects that ''the vast majority of overweight girls are not so happy.'' Apparent self-acceptance, she added, may be a cover for defiance or resignation. 
 Shoppers, too, can be skeptical. Checking out the Piper & Blue line at Kmart on Monday, Kristin Lopez, 20, a cosmetology student, said ''a lot of the clothes look cheap.''
 ''I don't like the way they fit, and, for the quality, the prices are too high,'' she added. The collection, which includes hot pink leggings, madras sundresses and a boldly striped yellow tank dress, is ticketed from about $13 to $25.
 Still, venturesome merchants are undeterred. ''The plus-size market is an attractive piece of the fashion business,'' said Fiona Ross, the brand director for Topshop's Evans line, which includes the Beth Ditto designs. In the United States as in England, Ms. Ross declared, ''we may want to be part of that opportunity.''

HEADLINE: Plastic Forks and Empty Tents Signal Decline in Corporate Spending for Golf

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Mike Abrams contributed reporting.

DATELINE: FARMINGDALE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
The sun was shining and the temperature was around 70 degrees at Bethpage State Park on Tuesday afternoon, perfect for watching golfers prepare for the United States Open this week. Indeed, tens of thousands of fans who paid $40 were walking the course.
 Few fans, though, seemed to be in the 50 or so hospitality tents, some of which cost $230,000 to rent for the week. Several tents lining the first fairway had signs on their doors that read, ''Tent Closed.'' 
 Their absence, although early in the week, was another reminder that corporate spending on sports -- even at premier events like the Open -- is continuing to sag as the recession wears on.
 Banks, carmakers and other companies that have accepted public bailouts have been chastened for their sponsorship deals and luxury suites at tournaments, arenas and stadiums. Some have stayed away from the Open, while those that bought tents before the downturn hit full stride last September are keeping a lower profile this year.
 ''Everything has been dialed back a bit,'' said Peter Bevacqua, the chief business officer at the United States Golf Association, which earns about three-quarters of its annual revenue from the Open. ''Conspicuous consumption is not in vogue.''
 Bevacqua said the days of selling 75 tents at a tournament were over and that the association sold about 50 to this year's Open. To compensate, the association sold more individual tickets to the three practice rounds.
 Over all, Bevacqua expected revenue from hospitality tents, catering, tickets, merchandise sales and other items this year to be about 20 percent lower than what the association had hoped to bring in when times were good, though he still expected the event to turn a profit. The association reported total revenue of nearly $156 million last fiscal year. 
 To help make ends meet, the U.S.G.A. has trimmed spending this year. The tents for the news media and others are less ornate, for instance, and silverware in the dining areas has been replaced with biodegradable plastic forks and knives.
 That will only partly offset the decline in revenue from the hospitality tents. Some companies that agreed to rent them before the financial crisis took hold are not using them to avoid having to pay for food and beverages, or to steer clear of unwanted scrutiny. Other companies, like National Grid, the largest utility on Long Island, are giving some of their tickets to employees, community groups and charities, which are auctioning them.
 On Tuesday, one stretch of hospitality tents along the first fairway, called the Tillinghast Village, was nearly empty, with the lights out at those purchased by Donald Trump, Fidelity Investments, Jefferies, Hertz, MetLife and others.
 At the Empire Village, on the 18th fairway, there was little activity at tents sold to companies including TD Bank, Charles Schwab, UBS, Barclays and Deutsche Bank.
 Of course, by the end of the week, more guests are likely to show up, particularly at the tents occupied by the association's four corporate partners, American Express, I.B.M., Lexus and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
 For them, entertainment is only one of the things they get out of the event. Lexusprovides hundreds of cars to the golfers and association officials. It has a tent where its latest models are showcased. At a hospitality tent on the 15th fairway, Lexus dealers and customers can rub shoulders with Johnny Miller, Annika Sorenstam and other golf personalities.
 I.B.M. runs the association's Web site and has invited clients to see the technology being used, as well as some of the action on the course.
 ''They certainly watch some golf, but we like for them to see the work areas,'' said Rick Singer, I.B.M.'s director of worldwide sponsorship marketing. ''This is not about hospitality; it's a global platform for our technology.''
 American Express sells tickets and package tours to the Open to its card-holders, who can also get a free radio headset to follow the broadcast of the tournament as they walk the course.
 The more muted atmosphere at the event, though, could trim hopes of an economic windfall for the municipalities near the golf course. In 2002, when the event was also at Bethpage, security was so tight that fans could not stop in nearby areas. Business dried up.
 This year, Farmingdale is running trolleys from the train station to the park and showing golf movies on the village green. 
 ''Economically, it's hard to put a dollar figure on it, but we're hoping for a big shot in the arm for the small boutiques here and pubs and restaurants,'' said David E. Smollett, the village's administrator, who expects a 10-fold increase in foot traffic this week.
 Joo Park and his wife, Sue, who own the All Aboard deli across from the Long Island Rail Road station, said the number of visitors in the morning was up threefold. He tripled his recent order for sandwich rolls, hoping to have enough to handle his three golf specials: the Tiger, the Phil and the Rocco. But many golf fans do not appear to be wandering far from the train station. On Main Street, many shops were closed by 6 p.m. on Tuesday. Only a few bars and restaurants were open, including Jim's Stogies, a cigar shop.
 The big-screen televisions that usually show baseball games will have golf on from beginning to end this weekend. The shop's owner, Jim Bueche, said customers had stopped in this week from Ohio and Colorado.
 But while he hopes to make a little extra money this week, he is not getting ahead of himself.
 ''I'm not here to make a million dollars,'' Bueche said. ''I'm just here to work and enjoy.''

HEADLINE: S.&P. Cuts Credit Ratings At 22 Banks, 5 to Junk

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
At 9:39 a.m. Wednesday, an operations manager in JPMorgan Chase's Tampa offices pushed a button and wired $25 billion in taxpayer money back to Washington. With that transfer and others like it across the country, 10 banks returned their slice of the financial bailout, freeing themselves from the stigma of a government lifeline and the increased oversight that went with it.
 But even as they rounded the corner, the troubles facing the country's smaller regional banks seemed to darken. 
 Standard & Poor's said on Wednesday that it was cutting the credit ratings and outlooks of 22 banks -- most of them regional ones -- and downgraded five of them to junk status, renewing questions over how some of the industry's weaker players would weather the recession. 
 The portfolios of many regional banks are stocked with corporate loans, mortgages and commercial real estate loans from hard-hit housing markets like those in Florida, Atlanta and the Rust Belt. While the banks have already lost billions on defaults, their balance sheets could remain in red ink if unemployment rises and housing prices keep tumbling, analysts said.
 Even if the housing market is nearing a bottom, new waves of losses are expected in construction loans and commercial real estate mortgages as tenants abandon shopping malls, office towers and strip malls. 
 Banks worth $1 billion to $5 billion have twice as much exposure to those loans as financial institutions worth $100 billion or more, according to data from Tony Davis, a banking analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. ''Those are huge numbers,'' Mr. Davis said. 
 They are part of the reason why many regional banks are also more likely than larger institutions to hold onto their government lifelines for the foreseeable future. 
 The 19 large financial institutions that went through the government's stress tests have already raised, according to Thomson Reuters, $50.9 billion in stock offerings since May 7, when regulators detailed the results of their assessments. The hundreds of other banks that received bailout funds but were not stress-tested have raised a total of only $1.8 billion in stock offerings. 
 For some, that could mean that they do not have a large enough capital cushion to repay their investment from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. And while the shares of big banks that passed the stress tests, like Goldman Sachs, have risen since the results were released, the KBW Regional Bank Index, a gauge of 50 banks, has fallen 17 percent over the same period. 
 In Michigan, where the unemployment rate has climbed to 14.1 percent -- the highest in the nation -- the struggling Citizens Republic Bancorp is in no rush to repay its $300 million federal bailout. The bank has lost $240 million in the last two quarters, and though it has strengthened its reserves and increased its liquidity, it still faces more losses and weak loan demand.
 ''Being in Michigan, it's very prudent for us to continue to work through the economic conditions in that marketplace and not try to rush any repayment of TARP until we know we're out of the financial crisis,'' said Charles D. Christy, the chief financial officer. ''Once we get out of the financial crisis, then we'll do what we need to do to pay back the TARP.''
 Citizens Republic was one of the five banks downgraded to junk status by Standard & Poor's. In addition to cutting ratings at smaller banks, analysts downgraded Wells Fargo and two banks that repaid their bailout money, BB&T and U.S. Bancorp.
 In their report, the analysts said they expected tougher operating conditions for banks, greater loan losses and more volatility in financial markets. Total charge-offs on bank loans were running at 1.94 percent in the first quarter of the year, a near record, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Analysts have said that dozens of weaker lenders were likely to close down over the rest of the year.
 ''We believe some firms may be better able to weather the risks ahead than others,'' Rodrigo Quintanilla, a credit analyst for S.& P., said in the report. ''In the long term, we could foresee ourselves raising ratings if lower earnings and reduced risk are accompanied by stronger risk-adjusted capital and effective governance.''
 Investors are growing wary, too. Shares of KeyCorp, Regions Financial and Fifth Third Bank all fell more than 5 percent on Wednesday. 
 Citizens Republic fell 16 percent on the downgrade, which Mr. Christy blamed in part on Michigan's dire economy.
 ''A lot of these regionals have been beaten up,'' said Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ''They ran too fast, too far.''

HEADLINE: Beleaguered City Opera Tries to Hold Off the Ultimate Finale

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
If nonprofit cultural organizations were run like corporations -- in which chief executives are, at least in principle, held accountable for financial performance -- the chairwoman of New York City Opera, Susan L. Baker, might well be out of a job. 
 During Ms. Baker's tenure, City Opera has raided its endowment -- which now stands at $16 million, down from $57 million when she was appointed in December 2003 -- to pay off debts and cover operating expenses. The practice, known as endowment invasion, requires approval from the state attorney general's office and the State Supreme Court, and is widely considered a last resort for any arts institution. 
 And recently the opera has sought a payout from a large fund dedicated to the renovation of the theater it shares with New York City Ballet. Most of the money in the fund comes from a $100 million gift that the oil-and-gas billionaire David H. Koch made last July. The theater has been under construction for much of the last year, forcing the opera to abandon its regular fall and spring seasons in favor of sporadic performances elsewhere. The opera, arguing that its lost revenue during that period qualifies as a renovation expense, has asked for $9 million as reimbursement -- although Mr. Koch, in an interview, said that ''it's out of the question that any of my money would go to City Opera for lost revenue.'' 
 These are bad times for many cultural institutions, and City Opera is certainly not the only one with a depleted endowment, striving to find money wherever it can. But a confluence of factors, some of them predating the economic downturn, seems to have brought the opera to an especially difficult pass. During the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2008 -- according to the most recent tax returns, obtained by Bloomberg News this month -- the company's revenue from ticket sales, donations and investments fell 23 percent to $32.9 million, while expenses increased 11 percent to $44.2 million, amounting to total losses of $11.3 million. 
 Since then there has been a slight increase in donations from individuals -- $4.75 million for fiscal year 2009, according to the opera, up from $4.48 million the year before -- which many point to as a sign of City Opera's donor loyalty despite the recession. But considering the lack of ticket sales in the last year, and that the company had to continue paying union employees throughout its dark period, the overall numbers for 2009 seem unlikely to be much better.
 Now, as George Steel prepares to open his first, sharply curtailed, fall season as general manager and artistic director -- 5 productions and 35 performances, in both cases about a third of the usual number -- some are wondering whether the ''people's opera,'' which Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia helped found in 1943, can survive much longer. Even if the company succeeds in getting compensated for last year's losses, it will have to find a way, in a punishing economy, both to replenish its endowment and sustain annual expenses of as much as $40 million. 
 ''I don't see how they could not close,'' said Robert W. Wilson, a former City Opera chairman who now serves on the Metropolitan Opera board. ''There is a slight chance that they can remain open, but where would the money come from?'' 
 Gone Before He Arrived
 In the midst of all this, not surprisingly, some opera enthusiasts have been questioning Ms. Baker and the board's management of the company, particularly around the hiring and subsequent defection of Gerard Mortier, the high-profile, iconoclastic Belgian opera director. Mr. Mortier was named general manager and artistic director in 2007, only to resign the following year, before he had even assumed the post, on the grounds that the $60 million operating budget he was expecting had dwindled to $36 million. 
 ''Hindsight is always 20/20,'' said Marc A. Scorca, the chief executive of Opera America, the service organization for the field. ''Conceptually the idea of bringing in an international artist who has the ability to shock -- in important ways it made great sense.'' But whether ''the company had realistically assessed its ability to support him financially,'' Mr. Scorca added, ''I don't know.''
 Ms. Baker's defenders argue that the problems on her watch, including Mr. Mortier's embarrassing departure, have been mainly the result of the souring economy. But even some people who hold her and the board more accountable see the opera's recent trials as part of a pattern bigger than any one administration -- namely City Opera's long history of ambitions outstripping capacity. 
 In the early 1980s Beverly Sills, then the general director, had to fund-raise her way out of a deficit that had grown to nearly $6 million before she arrived; in 1992, after a decade of balanced budgets, the company struggled with a shortfall of $2.9 million. In 2003, when City Opera was trying to secure a place in the performing arts center planned for ground zero, arts experts questioned whether the company could afford such a relocation, since it had a deficit of about $3.5 million -- a shortfall Ms. Baker inherited. 
 ''This is an organization whose resources have been stretched for a long period of time,'' said Kate D. Levin, New York City's cultural affairs commissioner. Ms. Baker's stint as chairwoman, Ms. Levin added, has ''brought to the fore a lot of issues that had been brewing, as the organization grew in ways that have proved not to be fully sustainable over the long term.''
 The current round of troubles began, some of those involved say, with the way Mr. Mortier was hired in February 2007. After a year-and-a-half-long search the board announced his appointment with much fanfare, just three months before the retirement of his predecessor, Paul Kellogg. A music-world celebrity who was running the Paris National Opera at the time, Mr. Mortier demanded, and got, dispensation to stay in France until his term as director there ended in September 2009. This meant, as some saw it, that City Opera would spend more than two years in a kind of limbo, with neither the leadership nor the fund-raising power that a strong director provides.
 Taking a Management Role
 Ms. Baker, who is now 58, had leadership experience of her own, having held high-level jobs at Goldman Sachs and other investment banks; after Mr. Kellogg's departure she stepped into a more active managerial role. Still, she recognized and deferred to Mr. Mortier's authority as the opera's future leader, other trustees say. It was Mr. Mortier who insisted that the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center -- since renamed the David H. Koch Theater, because of Mr. Koch's gift -- should be renovated rather than abandoned, ending City Opera's yearslong search for a more intimate auditorium that would offer better acoustics and a chance to get out from under the shadow of its powerful neighbor, the Met. 
 Since the renovation was largely driven by Mr. Mortier's desire for an expanded orchestra pit, it was the opera rather than the ballet that agreed to be out of the theater for a year, essentially forfeiting its 2008-9 season even as it had to continue paying union employees. Michael M. Kaiser, the president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, who has also become an unpaid adviser to City Opera, described that situation as ''a perfect storm,'' damaging to the company.
 Then, last November, Mr. Mortier pulled out, 10 months before he was to start the job and with the renovation already under way. Aside from the leadership vacuum that resulted, losing Mr. Mortier meant an end to Ms. Baker's hopes of leveraging excitement about the hire among potential donors. She and the board had counted on his name -- and his help in fund-raising efforts -- to make the larger budgets he was asking for possible. 
 As Mr. Steel put it, ''The board understood they were going to work closely with Gerard towards the raising of $60 million.'' In practice, according to some people involved in the situation, Mr. Mortier, who did not have extensive private fund-raising experience, came to New York much less frequently in the months after he was hired than had been anticipated. 
 Some board members and others close to the opera blame Ms. Baker -- who took the lead in wooing Mr. Mortier after meeting him at a dinner -- for acting precipitously, failing to do adequate due diligence about Mr. Mortier's potential limitations. In an interview Ms. Baker said of the Mortier chapter: ''I really don't want to get into all that. They were different times. I think we didn't do anything that didn't make sense at the time.'' 
 On the whole, Ms. Baker said, she has done her best with City Opera under increasingly trying economic circumstances. ''Nothing that the board has done and nothing I have done have been motivated by anything other than a love of the institution,'' she said.
 Supporters point out that Ms. Baker moved quickly to try to right the ship. In November 2008, days after Mr. Mortier's resignation, she and the board brought on Mr. Kaiser, known as the ''turnaround king'' for having helped stabilize several major arts organizations. (Mr. Kaiser is now also in charge of overseeing City Opera's compliance with the attorney general's rules governing access to its endowment and plans for restoring it.) 
 Mr. Steel came to the opera two months later, after 11 years as the executive director of the Miller Theater at Columbia University and three months as the general director of the Dallas Opera, a job he quit to return to New York. His plan to cut the season to five productions is part of an effort to restructure the company as a leaner operation that can live within its means, he said. 
 ''My job is to find the new right size of the company,'' Mr. Steel said, adding that he expected ultimately to arrive at an ''equilibrium'' of about 10 productions a season, on an operating budget of $35 million to $40 million.
 Toward that end the opera recently reached a new two-year contract with its orchestra union, under which members accepted a 25 percent reduction in work, to 22 guaranteed weeks from 29, according to Mary Landolfi, the president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians. Ms. Landolfi called the agreement ''a good compromise, given the current situation.'' 
 The company has not yet negotiated a new contract with the American Guild of Musical Artists, which represents City Opera's singers, but Mr. Steel may find more resistance from that union. ''While we obviously share City Opera's goal of achieving fiscal stability, the artists we represent will not see their contract decimated to make up for decades of mismanagement by City Opera's board,'' said Alan S. Gordon, the national executive director of the guild. Mr. Steel said he would not comment on pending union negotiations.
 Looking to the Board
 Mr. Steel and Ms. Baker said they were also focused on enlarging the board, a common strategy among nonprofits for increasing financial stability, since board members contribute money and solicit donations from friends and associates, and one that her critics say Ms. Baker should have been pursuing more aggressively all along. Currently 36 of the board's 44 members are expected to give or get a minimum of $50,000 a year, according to one trustee. (The other eight are ex officio members.) Some arts experts say that figure is relatively low for an organization of City Opera's size and ambitions.
 Some opera buffs question whether the company can attract the kind of wealthy, prominent trustees it needs to secure its future. ''Who would go on the board who is anybody?'' Mr. Wilson said. ''I can't imagine who you get to go on the board of a sinking ship.''
 One man willing to take the risk, Michael E. Gellert, a general partner at the New York investment firm Windcrest Partners, said he joined the City Opera board a few weeks ago mainly because of Mr. Steel, whom he got to know while serving on the advisory board of the Miller Theater. ''It may be foolish misplaced faith, but I really do have significant confidence in George,'' Mr. Gellert said, though he acknowledged, ''A sure bet it's not yet.''
 Mr. Steel is still relatively untested. Although he was a clear success at the Miller Theater, that was a considerably smaller organization with varied musical presentations. He has no experience running a large opera house, except for his brief stint in Dallas. And his artistic sensibility, which includes a healthy dose of the avant-garde, is widely considered risky. Some people have questioned his decision to include in his first-season ''Esther,'' a dissonant work that received its premiere in 1993 and has not been performed since.
 For her part Ms. Baker praised Mr. Steel for assembling a new season in ''record time'' and for reinvigorating the company. Asked about her own plans, she said, ''For the moment, I'm not going anywhere.'' According to one board member Ms. Baker asked Mr. Kaiser when he came on whether she should resign, and he advised her that the board could not be without a chairman in a moment of crisis. Mr. Kaiser confirmed this account.
 However City Opera emerges from this difficult chapter, people in the opera world say the company's survival is important. ''City Opera has a history of doing repertory that the Met will never do and that New Yorkers deserve to see,'' Mr. Scorca of Opera America said. ''There are singers who may never get to sing around the Lincoln Center fountain if not for New York City Opera. It's an art form that can be enjoyed by all. That founding principle of La Guardia is very much worth preserving.''

HEADLINE: Nascar Sponsors Find Customers in Other Sponsors

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
AFTER a day of business meetings in Charlotte, N.C., in May that brought together executives from Fortune 500 companies including United Parcel Service, Coca-Cola and Sprint Nextel, it was time to unwind. But the executives were not, as is their wont, transported to a golf course.
 Instead, they were whisked to a setting decidedly less familiar to cufflink-wearers: a go-kart track. 
 It was the second year of the Aflac 200 Nascar Corporate Kart Challenge, and competitors flooring it on the straightaways were members of Nascar's Fuel for Business Council, a group of about 40 companies that are Nascar's largest supporters, each spending as much as $25 million to sponsor drivers and races. 
 While Nascar often trumpets the high visibility enjoyed by its sponsors, whose logos festoon cars, as well as fans' fidelity to brands that bankroll drivers, one of the highest returns for companies' investments actually comes not from consumers but from other companies. The biggest fish some advertisers are reeling in, it turns out, are other advertisers.
 Nascar formed the business-to-business group, which meets quarterly, in 2004, and these days is underscoring its value more then ever.
 ''In a down economy, sponsors are looking for every nickel to work harder,'' said Andrew Giangola, a Nascar spokesman, adding that more than one-fifth of Fortune 500 companies sponsor Nascar at some level.
 Quarterly gatherings include speed meetings -- similar to speed dating -- where company representatives talk strategy in quick succession. Because attendees tend to be marketing and procurement executives, rather than their underlings, the meetings get results, with companies agreeing to drive business to one another and share discounts of up to 20 percent. 
 In 2007, according to Nascar, the Best Western hotel chain generated $16.7 million in revenue through deals made with other sponsors. For example, Best Western hotels now buy office supplies from Office Depot, use U.P.S. as their shipping carrier, and outfit employees in Cintas uniforms; those three companies, in turn, direct employees to book work-related travel at Best Western properties.
 Another sponsor, Ford, switched to U.P.S. and Office Depot as its preferred shipper and office supplier; in turn, those companies each promoted Ford discount programs to their employees. In 2008, some 1,800 U.P.S. employees and 100 Office Depot employees bought Ford vehicles through the programs.
 Although it has grown strongly over the last decade, Nascar is hardly recessionproof. Television ratings and race attendance are down while struggling Detroit automakers, historically big supporters, are trimming Nascar spending by as much as 30 percent. Other sponsors have scaled back, too. Some, like Cheerios, withdrew altogether.
 Others, though, are spending more than ever. After sponsoring races intermittently in previous years, Aflac, the insurer, decided in 2007 to sponsor the driver Carl Edwards, whose car now displays the company's duck mascot, drawing enthusiastic quacks from fans.
 Jeff Charney, chief marketing officer at Aflac, said the company ''has very firm metrics that we looked at with this sponsorship and we're hitting every one right on.''
 Along with the most obvious metric, reaching consumers, Mr. Charney cites relationships Aflac has forged with other sponsors. Beyond the quarterly meetings, he regularly sets up trackside meetings at Nascar races. 
 ''It's a wonderful way to do business away from the boardroom,'' Mr. Charney said. ''When I go to a race I don't have my business suit on, but I have my business mind-set and I'm ready to do business.''
 Mr. Charney said that insurance regulations restricted what he could reveal about the company's partnerships. But Mr. Giangola of Nascar said that among other deals Aflac had struck, the insurer was now part of the benefits program Office Depot offered its employees. He added that in turn, Aflac buys all of its office supplies from Office Depot.
 Mark Dickens, a U.P.S. spokesman, said that when the company first became a Nascar sponsor in 2000, it conducted business with 40 percent of the other Nascar sponsors, but increased that to 90 percent today.
 Mr. Dickens also said that Nascar drivers, perhaps more than other athletes, were willing to meet clients that U.P.S. took to events and to visit the company's offices to rub elbows with employees.
 That potential to bolster employee morale also is being highlighted these days.
 After the driver Matt Kenseth, who is sponsored by the toolmaker DeWalt, won the Daytona 500 in February, he spent a few hours at the company's headquarters in Towson, Md., meeting employees. 
 The toolmaker's parent company, Black & Decker, laid off 1,200 employees in January, and while the Nascar sponsorship no doubt struck some who were fired as an extravagance, racing fans among those who remained were jubilant.
 ''What Matt Kenseth was able to do for us internally in a down economy when we're going through a lot of challenging times is bring a lot of energy and passion back to the employees of DeWalt and to the brand itself,'' said Jon Howland, marketing director for DeWalt. 
 In their front lobby is an actual racecar -- a backup for the Daytona 500 two years ago -- which required a wall to be removed and replaced. And employees favor DeWalt racing shirts, which can make a company meeting resemble a pit crew.
 ''I'm going into a meeting right now,'' said Mr. Howland in a telephone interview on a recent afternoon. ''I've got a DeWalt racing shirt on right now, and of nine people at the meeting, six of us are wearing DeWalt racing shirts.''

 CORRECTION:
The Advertising column on Thursday, about Nascar's efforts to bring its sponsors together to increase one another's businesses, misstated Cheerios' current Nascar promotion. It has joined Richard Childress Racing as primary sponsor of Clint Bowyer's Cheerios/Hamburger Helper Chevrolet. Cheerios, which has sponsored Nascar teams for 12 seasons, has not withdrawn its sponsorship. (General Mills, the parent company of Cheerios, stopped sponsoring the Petty Enterprise Nascar team last season.)

HEADLINE: Estimate Places Natural Gas Reserves 35% Higher

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Thanks to new drilling technologies that are unlocking substantial amounts of natural gas from shale rocks, the nation's estimated gas reserves have surged by 35 percent, according to a study due for release on Thursday.
 The report by the Potential Gas Committee, the authority on gas supplies, shows the United States holds far larger reserves than previously thought. The jump is the largest increase in the 44-year history of reports from the committee.
 The finding raises the possibility that natural gas could emerge as a critical transition fuel that could help to battle global warming. For a given amount of heat energy, burning gas produces about half as much carbon dioxide, the main cause of global warming, as burning coal. 
 Estimated natural gas reserves rose to 2,074 trillion cubic feet in 2008, from 1,532 trillion cubic feet in 2006, when the last report was issued. This includes the proven reserves compiled by the Energy Department of 237 trillion cubic feet, as well as the sum of the nation's probable, possible and speculative reserves.
 The new estimates show ''an exceptionally strong and optimistic gas supply picture for the nation,'' according to a summary of the report, which is issued every two years by a group of academics and industry experts that is supported by the Colorado School of Mines. 
 Much of that jump comes from estimated gas in shale rocks, which drilling companies have only recently learned how to tap. They have developed a technique called hydraulic fracturing, in which water is injected at high pressure into wells to shatter rocks deep underground, helping to release trapped gas.
 The method, perfected in recent years in places like Texas and Pennsylvania, has set off a boom in new drilling, but is coming under increasing regulatory and environmental scrutiny. Shale gas accounts for 616 trillion cubic feet of reserves, or a third of the total, according to the report. 
 ''New and advanced exploration, well drilling and completion technologies are allowing us increasingly better access to domestic gas resources -- especially 'unconventional' gas -- which, not that long ago, were considered impractical or uneconomical to pursue,'' said John B. Curtis, a geology professor at the Colorado School of Mines and the report's principal author.
 The huge increase in estimated gas supplies comes just as concerns about energy security and climate change are prompting the most profound shift in energy policy since the oil shocks of the 1970s. 
 The Obama administration has sought more stringent fuel standards for new cars, and Congress is debating regulations that would progressively limit carbon dioxide emissions throughout the economy. The administration has taken a cautious approach to conventional energy resources, freezing leases to develop oil shale reserves and carefully reviewing future offshore leases for oil and gas. 
 Instead, the administration seeks to increase the share of renewable energy, especially wind and solar power. But experts say that meeting these goals will prove challenging given the scale of the nation's energy use and the costs involved in switching from fossil fuels. 
 Shale gas currently provides a small fraction of the nation's total gas production. But many experts believe the rising supply of natural gas means it can substitute for other fossil fuels. With the output of conventional gas forecast to decline, the Energy Department expects that shale production will rise substantially to meet higher demand, as will imports.
 Natural gas accounts for about a quarter of the nation's total energy use, and 22 percent of electrical production. Coal accounts for about half of the nation's power generation, while oil dominates transportation fuels. While gas generates less carbon dioxide than oil or coal, it still accounted for about 20 percent of domestic energy-related emissions in 2006.
 The Energy Department estimates that demand for natural gas will rise by 13 percent by 2030. In the power sector, utilities have been switching to natural gas from coal, but further increases in the use of gas will most likely depend on whether Congress puts a price on carbon dioxide emissions, as it is considering. That would favor cleaner fuels like gas. 
 ''It's nice to have aspirations about renewable energy and efficiency, but we need to recognize these are long-term goals and that we need something to get us there in the meantime,'' said Guy F. Caruso, a former administrator of the Energy Information Administration. ''Natural gas has a role to play as a bridge because of the long lead time and scalability issues of renewable fuels.'' 
 That the nation's gas reserves were bigger than expected does not mean they will necessarily be developed, Mr. Caruso warned. ''There are some things to be cautious about,'' he said, ''and obviously one of them is cost, and the other is regulatory risk.''
 In recent years, industry executives and analysts have been surprised by the discovery and successful development of new supplies of shale gas, like the Barnett Shale in the area around Fort Worth. 
 But higher drilling costs and the extensive use of water to fracture shale rocks have raised concerns about the long-run commercial potential of these supplies. Some environmental groups fear that hydraulic fracturing will pollute drinking water, and Congress is considering tighter regulation of the practice.
 Mr. Caruso said that gas prices needed to be around $4 to $6 per thousand cubic feet to justify developing shale beds. They have fallen below that level at times in recent months, though gas settled Wednesday at $4.25. 
 For advocates of the gas industry, the report vindicates the potential of natural gas in the economy. 
 ''Natural gas is part of the solution for a low-carbon future, and not an impediment,'' said Chris McGill, the managing director for policy analysis at the American Gas Association, a trade group. ''It has been difficult to get policy makers over that hump. Many have a vision of gas as a resource we're running out of, and that's just not true.''

HEADLINE: Economic Slump Dashes the Oregon Dreams Of Californians

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEND, Ore. 

 BODY:
Susan and Mike Telford had a plan back in the boom years in California. They would sell their house outside Fresno at a solid profit and take their equity to this sunny mountain city to build a better life, a fresh-air future in Oregon. 
 ''We wanted to lose the commute, to lose the smog,'' Mrs. Telford said. ''We wanted to lose California.''
 They moved here in 2006, when Bend was one of the fastest-growing places in the West and money and migration from California fueled that growth. Now the Bend area's unemployment rate, at almost 16 percent, is one of the highest of any metropolitan area in the nation. ''For sale'' signs dot desert-toned, unfinished subdivisions. Luxury furniture stores downtown are going out of business. San Francisco chefs have fled. 
 The freefall has made Bend a succinct symbol for the economic perils of ''lifestyle destinations'' in the so-called New West, recreation-heavy communities where jobs have been heavily tilted toward construction and services and where many of the new residents were self-made exiles from California cashing in on their overpriced real estate. Bend, a former timber town that now has 80,000 residents, was particularly popular among those drawn to the often rainy Northwest because it is located on the sunny side of the Cascade Range. 
 Now the Californians who contributed to Oregon's growth are in some cases adding to its economic struggle. As of May, Oregon had the second-highest unemployment rate in the nation, at 12.4 percent, behind Michigan. California, which has not released its May figures, ranked fifth in April.
 While some other states with high unemployment, including Michigan, have seen their labor forces shrink, Oregon's labor force has grown. Economists say some of the growth appears to be driven by people who moved here with money they made in California, whether from real estate or stock market investments, and expected to get by but now must look for work.
 ''It's just so depressing to hear them because they thought they had life handled and they don't,'' said Bobbie Faust, an employment counselor who works for the state in Bend.
 The Telfords are among those facing trouble. They had presumed they would be able to sell their house in Fresno for more than $300,000 to help pay the mortgage on the new house they bought near the Deschutes River in Bend for $475,000. But the Fresno house has yet to sell, and Mrs. Telford, an accountant, has lost a series of jobs at small firms here that she said had downsized. The couple's only income now comes from her unemployment checks and her husband's salary as a high school teacher. 
 ''The cash flow is negative,'' Mrs. Telford said. ''This will be the first time we've had to go into savings.''
 Not all of the newcomers are from California, of course. Lost equity, lost jobs and the possibility of foreclosure also threaten people who moved here from just across the Cascade Range, on the wetter western side of Oregon, as well as some from Seattle or the East. Measuring California's economic impact on Oregon and its struggles is difficult, and economists say that Oregon, which has less than a tenth of the population of California, has not always been directly affected by its neighbor's fortunes.
 Still, just as other places in the West have blamed California transplants for treading heavily into town, the words ''California equity'' roll off many tongues here in Deschutes County with particular resentment these days. 
 ''California immigrants can never win in Oregon,'' said Philip J. Romero, an economist who has advised governors in both states. ''In a boom, 'They are crowding the roads and bidding up house prices.' In a bust, it's: 'They alone caused the price of my house to drop by hundreds of thousands of dollars. They came up here without a job, and now we can't absorb them and they're competing for my job.' ''
 Carolyn Eagan, a regional economist for the Oregon Employment Department, pointed to federal data showing that the overall percentage of personal income from dividends, investments and rental income in Deschutes County was almost 26 percent in 2007, the latest year for which data were available. Compared with an overall state rate of slightly less than 21 percent, the figures suggest that people here, more than elsewhere, have relied on income from sources other than a steady job.
 ''Shhh,'' Biff Ingels, a transplant of four years, standing outside the main job counseling center here, said when asked where he had lived before. ''California,'' he said in a whisper.
 A cultural shift appears to be under way. One of Bend's leading restaurants had been Merenda, whose chef, Jody Denton, came from San Francisco in 2002. Under mounting debt, Mr. Denton closed the restaurant in January and left for a job in Australia. Several people involved with the restaurant before it closed have reopened it under a new name, 900 Wall, its street address. The menu has been recast from mostly French and Italian cuisine so that it now incorporates more ingredients from the Northwest and has slightly more approachable pricing. 
 ''We're trying to present ourselves as a local restaurant,'' said Cliff Eslinger, the executive chef. ''We'd relied far too heavily on outside forces.''
 Another casualty was Bend Living, a glossy regional magazine driven by advertisements for high-end homes and luxury furniture. Kevin Max, the magazine's former editor, is planning the first issue of a new magazine about Oregon culture and history, based in Bend and set to make its debut this summer. It is called ''1859,'' a reference to the year Oregon entered the union. 
 ''Bend Living was about Bend's emergence into 24-7, go-go-go, irresponsible construction and people living beyond their means,'' Mr. Max said. ''1859 is kind of National Geographic meets Conde Nast Traveler. It's about Oregon, so it's all about sustainability.''
 Locally, sustainability is a challenge. Bend's job market has not proved diverse enough or deep enough to provide jobs for the newcomers who suddenly need them. ''Poverty with a view'' is how many people describe Bend before the boom. Economists say the city's sudden abundance of investment income and housing equity from newcomers made Bend seem more secure than it was. While experienced people like Mrs. Telford, the accountant from Fresno, struggle to find work, there are longer term questions over how the area will support its newest residents.
 Zachary Lauritzen, a student teacher at Summit High School, on Bend's west side -- the side some residents call ''Little California'' -- said he was teaching a lesson in government when the topic prompted him to ask how many students had lived in California.
 ''Half of them raised their hands,'' Mr. Lauritzen said.

HEADLINE: Senate Stays Paralyzed; So Do Bills Big and Small

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
In the week since the State Senate was thrown into disarray by a coup that left Democrats and Republicans fighting over who is in charge, the Capitol has taken on the air of a tragic comedy.
 There were the bolted Senate chamber gates and the senator who twisted his ankle after a demonstrator knocked him to the ground. There was even a clown.
 But amid all the absurdity, it can be easy to forget that real business does go on in Albany, and that the votes lawmakers take every day can mean the difference of tens of millions of dollars for local governments across the state. 
 The Assembly has passed dozens of bills in recent weeks that would allow counties to charge additional sales tax. But those bills have been bottled up in the Senate, which has not taken action on a single piece of legislation since June 8. 
 ''That's the thing that I think is being missed by most people,'' said Joanne M. Mahoney, county executive for Onondaga County, which includes Syracuse. ''I don't know if they realize this has very real consequences for us on the local level. This pays for our schools, our public safety. It's $40 million for our budget.''
 Onondaga County, like many others across New York, charges an additional 4 percent sales tax on top of the 4 percent charged by the state. But in order to do that, it needs permission from the Legislature every two years.
 With the recession pinching the budgets of local governments, sales tax revenue is especially critical this year. And many county leaders are beginning to worry that the Senate stalemate will hurt their budgetary bottom lines.
 ''This would not be the time for that to happen,'' said James E. Eisel Sr., the chairman of the Delaware County Board of Supervisors, who estimated the county would lose $5 million a year if the tax were not renewed. ''We need it. There's no question about it.''
 Revenue bills, of course, are not the only items thrown into uncertainty by the Senate leadership dispute. Major issues like governance of New York City schools, which the Assembly approved on Wednesday, and same-sex marriage are up in the air. 
 So are smaller-impact bills the Assembly has passed, like one that would designate May 17 as Thurgood Marshall Day, and one to rename a portion of State Route 38, which runs through the Finger Lakes region, as the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial Highway of Valor.
 Senate Republicans have tried to vote on these and other bills but could not take any action because Democrats have refused to take their seats in a show of protest, claiming that the Republican coup was illegal.
 The Senate has been split evenly at 31-31 since Senator Hiram Monserrate, one of two Democrats who initially sided with Republicans to oust Democrats from power, flipped back to the Democratic side of the aisle. Without a majority vote of 32, the Senate cannot act.
 The stalemate has spawned some creative suggestions and legal theories.
 Senator Pedro Espada Jr., the other Democrat who sided with Republicans and was elected as the new Senate president in last week's overthrow, said on Wednesday that the State Constitution allowed him to cast two votes in the case of a tie: one as senator, and one as acting lieutenant governor, who is empowered by the Constitution to cast a vote in the event of a tie. (Because the lieutenant governor's office is vacant, that office's powers fall to the Senate president.)
 The constitutional language in question is vague, and any such move would probably lead to litigation by Democrats. 
 Mr. Espada also said that should the Democrats not return to the chamber on Thursday, his two votes, added to 30 votes from Republican senators, would be sufficient to provide the legal equivalent of a quorum. 
 ''We're maintaining that if there are 31 members present, and ready to vote, those 31 members can ask for a tie-breaking vote to be cast,'' Mr. Espada said.
 Democrats blasted Mr. Espada's theory as absurd.
 ''That's like asking to get a vote for every district you supposedly live in,'' said Austin Shafran, the spokesman for the Senate Democrats.
 He was alluding to the continuing investigations by the state attorney general and the Bronx district attorney into whether Mr. Espada, who has a residence in Westchester County but represents the Bronx, spends enough time at his home in his district.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths WAGNER, MARTIN

 BODY:
WAGNER--Martin, labor arbitrator, university leader and influential scholar died on Tuesday in his home. He was 97 and lived in Urbana, Illinois. Professor Wagner served as director of the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations (now the School of Labor and Employment Relations) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, from 1958 to 1968. He continued as a professor until 1982, when he retired and was awarded emeritus status. 
Wagner played a central role in the development of public sector labor relations laws for the state of Illinois, including five years of service as chairman of the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board and leadership on numerous state and regional federal commissions and boards on training, labor-management relations, unemployment, wage-price controls, civil service, and related matters. Early in his career, Wagner served in the WWII Office of Production Management and as a regional director for the National Labor Relations Board in San Francisco and Cincinnati. In 1948, he served as the founding executive director of the Louisville Labor-Management Committee, the nation's first area labor-management committee. In that same year, he was a founding member of the Industrial Relations Research Association (now the Labor and Employment Relations Association), which recently honored Wagner with its lifetime achievement award. He was also recognized recently for 50 years of service in the National Academy of Arbitrators (NAA), a rare accomplishment as individuals are only inducted into the NAA after they have already achieved prominence in the profession. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) provided Wagner with a Lifetime Membership Award in 1996, a particularly significant accomplishment for a labor neutral. At the School of Labor and Employment Relations at the University of Illinois, Wagner launched one of the early doctoral programs in industrial relations in 1966. He was beloved by former students and colleagues alike and is seen as having provided the core "dna" for what is one of the nation's top programs in labor and employment relations. Born on September 11, 1911, in Newport Kentucky, Wagner earned A.B. and M.A. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1933 and 1935 respectively. He was a Rhodes Scholar, (Magdalen '36) earning a B.A. from Oxford University in 1937 and later an M.A. from Oxford in 1960. At the 100th anniversary celebration of the Rhodes Scholar program in 2003, Martin Wagner was the third oldest recipient in attendance. Wagner is survived by his son John, of Orlando, FL, his daughter Martha Wagner Weinberg, of Brookline, MA, and two grandchildren, David and Katy Weinberg. His wife Nelle Nordstrom Wagner preceded him in death in 1997. A commemorative celebration of Martin Wagner's life and accomplishments is on Saturday morning, September 12th in the Martin Wagner Education Center at the School of Labor and Employment Relations, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, with a memorial service to follow on that weekend.

HEADLINE: PROTESTERS DEFY IRANIAN EFFORTS TO CLOAK UNREST

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI; Sharon Otterman contributed reporting from New York, and Alan Cowell from Paris.

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
Iranians angry at the results of last week's election pushed their protest forward on Wednesday, from tens of thousands who again flooded the streets here to six soccer players on the national team who wore opposition green wristbands at a World Cup qualifying game. 
 But there were signs of an intensified crackdown: The government worked on many fronts to shield the outside world's view of the unrest, banning coverage of the demonstrations, arresting journalists, threatening bloggers and trying to block Web sites like Facebook and Twitter, which have become vital outlets for information about the rising confrontation here. 
 The senior prosecutor in the central province of Isfahan, where there have also been tense demonstrations, went so far as to say protesters could be executed under Islamic law. 
 As nations around the world urged Iran's leadership to exercise restraint, Mir Hussein Moussavi, the opposition presidential candidate who the government said finished second, and one of Iran's chief reformers, Mohammad Khatami, issued a joint letter urging an end to violence and arrests. 
 ''We ask you to take all the necessary measures to put an end to today's worrying situation, to stop the violent actions against people and to free those arrested,'' they wrote in a letter on Mr. Moussavi's Web site.
 Mr. Moussavi also sought to continue the momentum of public protest, calling for a day of mourning on Thursday for at least seven people killed in the demonstrations. 
 The crisis -- the gravest since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 -- erupted after Iran's Interior Ministry declared that the moderate Mr. Moussavi was defeated by the conservative incumbent, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in Friday's election by 63 percent to 34 percent. Mr. Moussavi, the demonstrators who represent a cross section of Iranian society and part of the clerical establishment have called the official results a fraud. 
 With the nation's ruling class apparently divided by the results, the hard-liners in charge sought to portray the unrest as the work of outsiders. The powerful Revolutionary Guard said it had taken action against ''deviant news sites'' financed by American and Canadian companies. 
 The Foreign Ministry, meantime, summoned the Swiss ambassador, who represents American interests in Tehran, in protest of what it called ''meddling'' by the United States into its affairs because of statements by American officials on Iran's elections. It also summoned the Canadian charge d'affaires over the same accusations. Several other European ambassadors were summoned Tuesday. 
 America and Iran broke off diplomatic relations after the 1979 revolution. 
 No apparent ground was gained Wednesday in reaching a negotiated solution. 
 This week, Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final word on state matters and who certified Mr. Ahmadinejad's re-election, apparently made two concessions to the protests, ordering an investigation into the election and calling for a partial recount. 
 But Mr. Moussavi and the protesters are rejecting anything less than new elections.
 ''It is a very complicated situation,'' said Abbass Abdi, a political scientist in Tehran. ''People feel humiliated because they came and voted in large numbers. On the other hand, it is very difficult for the establishment to admit fraud because its legitimacy would go under question.
 ''There is no legal solution to this dilemma and, we need a solution that neither side would lose face.''
 For the third day in a row, supporters of Mr. Moussavi massed in silence, from Hafteh Tir Square, with photographs and samizdat video showing a sea of people at least tens of thousands strong. Many protesters wore black to honor those slain in recent days, a witness said. Some carried flowers and wore green ribbons to show their support for Mr. Moussavi. 
 ''We are becoming stronger,'' said Abolfazl, 36, a cab driver. ''The only way we can win is to stick together and keep coming back.''
 Mostafa, 26, a businessman, who had gone to the rally on the back of a friend's motorcycle, said he did not fear the violent clashes that killed protesters. ''The student protests failed because people left the students alone,'' he said, referring to the student protests in 1999 and 2003. ''This time they cannot defeat us because everybody has joined.''
 Surprise support for the protesters came from members of Iran's soccer team, with several wearing the bright green ribbons, now the signature for Mr. Moussavi's supporters, during a game with South Korea. 
 The national football team is controlled by the government, and their defiance demonstrated the deepening divide. 
 It was unclear whether clashes erupted between security forces and protesters later Wednesday evening, as has happened during other protests this week. 
 The government had announced that seven people were killed Monday and 15 others were injured after a Basij militia, loyal to Mr. Ahmadinejad, opened fire on people. On Wednesday, a student group, the Office for Consolidating Unity, said in a statement on its Web site that five students were killed in an attack on a Tehran University dormitory and two other students were killed in a separate attack at the dormitory in the southern city of Shiraz.
 Iran's Interior Ministry on Thursday ordered an investigation into the episode at Tehran University, which has been widely denounced inside Iran. 
 Meanwhile, the government expanded its crackdown with more arrests and pressure against journalists to limit coverage of the protests. 
 Saeed Leylaz, an economist and political analyst, was arrested Wednesday at his home. Mohammad Reza Jalaipour, a sociologist and university professor, was also arrested. Reporters Without Borders said that at least 11 Iranian journalists had been arrested. 
 Because of continued intimidation and pressure on journalists, at least one newspaper, Khabar, said Wednesday that it would stop publishing. A representative from the office of the prosecutor general in Tehran on Friday began screening newspapers before publication to block what it called ''provocative'' material. 
 In an effort that appeared to limit reporters' access, foreign news outlets were warned by the Ministry of Culture not to ''participate in or cover'' the rallies because the ministry said it ''had received specific threats against reporters.'' One photographer, Amin Kiani, was stabbed at a protest on Tuesday. The ministry expanded its restriction on Wednesday to covering any news conferences linked to Mr. Moussavi. 
 News agencies reported that Mohammadreza Habibi, the senior prosecutor in the central province of Isfahan, had warned demonstrators that they could be executed under Islamic law.
 ''We warn the few elements controlled by foreigners who try to disrupt domestic security by inciting individuals to destroy and to commit arson that the Islamic penal code for such individuals waging war against God is execution,'' Mr. Habibi said, according to the Fars news agency.

 BODY:
Lesson for China
 In Smoot-Hawley
 A request from Beijing that local governments ''Buy China'' is worrying -- and hypocritical. Even as President Hu Jintao joined leaders of Brazil, Russia and India at a summit meeting in Yekaterinburg, Russia, in calling for an end to protectionism, a diktat from several Chinese ministries suggested that government projects should favor domestic suppliers in spending some $586 billion of fiscal stimulus money. Such doublespeak is dangerous. Countries with bloated export sectors shouldn't throw stones. 
 Buying local would certainly cause pain for foreign suppliers. After China's last big fiscal stimulus in 1998, imports rose by 18 percent and 36 percent in the following two years. This time, over a third of the projects are railways, roads, airports and power grids, potentially big users of foreign machinery and technology. Foreign suppliers have already lost out on high-profile multibillion-dollar tenders for wind turbines and high-speed trains. 
 But genuine protectionism would hurt China, too. Recall the Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930, in which the United States raised tariffs against imports to protect domestic industries and shore up employment. At first it worked. But when other countries retaliated, unemployment in the nation more than doubled. China might face a similar problem. And with civil unrest Beijing's greatest worry, such a price looks too high. 
 Luckily, locking out foreigners in practice would be impossible. Much of China's import growth comes from things it can't produce enough of itself, like oil, iron, copper and aluminum. Besides, Beijing cannot watch everyone. Procurement is done on a local level: Beijing doesn't have a database to track what projects are supplied by whom, according to people familiar with bidding processes, and each city's whims are vastly different from the next. 
 It may be that promises to buy local are merely meant to stoke up confidence, as is Beijing's style. But the danger is that even talk of a ''Buy China'' policy may fan the flames of protectionism elsewhere. Exporters in the United States protested the ''buy American'' provisions in this country's economic stimulus package for the same reason. India and the United States are already mulling complaints over Chinese ''dumping'' of goods like steel and tires, which are seen to be hitting domestic industries. At worst, China could reap the whirlwind of Smoot-Hawley without even the fleeting benefits.
 Twitter's Growth
 Twitter's Internet messaging service is proving to be more than a tool for gossipy adolescents. Media around the world are using so-called tweets -- messages sent through the service -- from Tehran to supplement their coverage of the post-election upheaval. 
 This has given the revenue-free Web service a credibility boost. But Twitter still hasn't proved it can leverage its popularity to make money. 
 Twitter's messages are sent and received instantly via computers and mobile phones. The service has some 10 million members, including celebrities like Britney Spears and companies like CNN. 
 Iran's election has been a boon for the company. Global media outlets including the BBC and CNN are broadcasting tweets about the protests. Twitter has proved such a useful source of information about the upheaval that the United States government asked the company to postpone a scheduled maintenance so it could stay online. 
 Until now, Twitter has essentially been an outlet for angst-ridden teenagers and public relations stunts. That has made the financial interest drawn by the start-up, including rumors that Google was in talks to buy it for more than $250 million, perplexing. But the discovery of its utility as a real-time reporting tool shows it might have some value. That could help justify its acquisition by a media outlet, or an Internet giant with aspirations in that field, like Google. 
 That doesn't mean Twitter will necessarily find a way to spin money. And the credibility and balance of the news it disseminates are questionable. Most Iranians posting tweets are likely to be young, educated and reasonably wealthy, and so it has a built-in bias. And there are already reports -- on Twitter, of course -- that the Iranian government was creating fake Twitter accounts to spread propaganda. 
 The situation in Iran is unusual in that there are few foreign journalists on the ground there. Twitter would have little utility in reporting from, say, the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Twitter may be one of the most talked-about Internet businesses in the world right now, but it has far to go before it proves itself worthy of the chatter.

HEADLINE: The States of Iraq and Afghanistan

BYLINE: By JASON CAMPBELL, MICHAEL O'HANLON, JEREMY SHAPIRO and AMY UNIKEWICZ. 
Jason Campbell is a research analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Michael O'Hanlon and Jeremy Shapiro are senior fellows at Brookings. Amy Unikewicz is a graphic designer in South Norwalk, Conn.

 BODY:
''G oing forward, we will not blindly stay the course,'' President Obama said in unveiling his new Afghanistan strategy this spring. ''Instead, we will set clear metrics to measure progress.'' Unfortunately, finding useful metrics for assessing counterinsurgencies is not easy. Getting the force size right is key to a successful counterinsurgency, but there is no exact formula -- even when you get the numbers right the troops may fail because of poor training, difficult terrain or shifting politics. 
 So how to best measure actual progress? The civilian fatality rate is clearly important -- yet it is often a lagging indicator of changes in momentum. As important as reducing violence, therefore, is improving government institutions and the provision of services. This is hard to measure, but economic and quality of life indicators give some hint. 
 The American troop buildup in Afghanistan is proceeding on schedule, and contact with the enemy and violence have increased accordingly (though civilian fatalities, mercifully, have not increased). Convoys carrying NATO supplies are having fewer problems getting through, but travel for ordinary Afghans has not become easier or safer. There are other vital indicators that unfortunately the military is not tracking well at present. One is the crime rate. Another is the inflow of fighters across the border -- it's a notoriously difficult thing to measure, but the Pentagon figured out how to do it in Iraq.
 As for Iraq, despite various horrible attacks, this year has not seen a reversal of previous progress against insurgents. More worrisome is the political scene; the Baghdad government has achieved 6.5 of the 11 ''Iraq index'' benchmarks we have laid out, which include steps like establishing provincial election laws and enacting amnesty laws. This actually indicates lost ground from a score of 7 in April. On balance, the situation is much improved, but hardly stable, especially since most American troop reductions have yet to occur.

HEADLINE: Tough or Timid?

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; John Harwood and David Stout contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
No sooner had President Obama proposed a new regulatory road map for the country's financial system on Wednesday than senior lawmakers expressed reservations about one of the plan's central elements -- to broadly expand the reach of the Federal Reserve to regulate financial risk across the entire system. 
 Mr. Obama said that the plan would protect consumers, impose new restraints on financial behemoths and guard against the murky practices that caused the market crisis. 
 ''A culture of irresponsibility took root from Wall Street to Washington to Main Street,'' he said in a speech to industry executives and senior officials in the East Room of the White House. ''A regulatory regime basically crafted in the wake of a 20th century economic crisis -- the Great Depression -- was overwhelmed by the speed, scope and sophistication of a 21st century global economy.'' 
 Administration officials said that much of the proposal would not require Congressional action and would be adopted by regulators. These include raising the amount of the financial cushion that institutions must hold against losses, setting new conflict of interest rules for credit rating agencies and imposing new requirements that banks hold on their own books a percentage of the mortgages they issue to discourage the marketing of abusive or ill-suited loans.
 But the most significant elements would require new laws. Minutes after Mr. Obama's speech, the two Democratic chairmen whose committees will put their own imprint on the plan vowed to complete legislation by the end of this year, but only on Congress's terms. 
 Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said the central bank's failure to be a tough-minded regulator over the last decade had left him and other lawmakers without ''a lot of confidence in the Fed at this point.'' One of the criticisms is the Fed's failure to stop the sale of subprime mortgages and other dangerous home loans that helped cause the financial crisis.
 Mr. Dodd said giving the Fed a new role as overall risk regulator might also compromise its independent status and conflict with its mandate to control inflation and manage the supply of money by setting interest rates. 
 Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who until recently was publicly supportive of an expanded role for the Fed, said a significant number of lawmakers have raised concerns and that it would probably be one of the harder issues to resolve. 
 Mr. Frank, who heads the House Financial Services Committee, said he strongly opposed a different part of the president's proposal, which would eliminate more than 1,000 federal thrift charters around the nation. Many of those thrifts are in Mr. Frank's home region of New England.
 Some large financial institutions are expected to lobby against giving the Fed more power to police the system. They fear that the central bank would significantly raise the amount of capital they must hold against losses, which would reduce their profitability and make them less competitive with smaller companies that have lower capital rates. 
 The architects of the plan, Timothy F. Geithner, Treasury secretary, and Lawrence Summers, director of the National Economic Council, said it was essential to give the Fed more authority to avert or at least minimize future market crises. 
 ''While I don't think there is any regulator that doesn't look back with a great deal of regret,'' Mr. Summers said at a news briefing, ''it's important to recognize that many of these problems didn't happen in areas that the Fed touched and, in fact, they often involved companies that managed to escape the Fed's jurisdiction.''
 The Fed, for example, did not supervise any of the major financial company failures like Bear Stearns, the American International Group, Lehman Brothers and Countrywide Financial. But it has supervised the holding companies at some of the largest banks, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.
 He said the other alternative that some have proposed, a committee of regulators to police the system, simply would not work.
 ''Experience in financial regulation, in government and in life in general suggests that collective responsibility means no responsibility, or at least no accountability,'' Mr. Summers said.
 Mr. Geithner said the administration had studied a range of alternatives and had found that those countries that split the functions of systemic regulator and central banker often suffered deeper financial problems during periods of crisis.
 ''The president believes there is not a better way to prevent and manage a future crisis without putting the authority in one place,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''We have to make a choice. I do not believe there is a plausible alternative that provides accountability, credibility and gets to the core of the problem.''
 Mr. Summers suggested that the overhaul plan reflected a sharp break from the traditional view in Washington that the marketplace, rather than the government, should determine when to put a stop to speculative bubbles like the upward spiral in housing prices from the late 1990s to 2006. 
 Under the new view he described, the government should play a major role in cutting excessive lending and speculation before they lead to market crises.
 ''The president does not accept the judgment,'' Mr. Summers said, ''that we let market forces rip and then when there is an accident, we clean up afterwards.''
 Under Mr. Obama's plan, the Fed would expand its current reach of overseeing bank holding companies -- those owning more than one commercial bank -- to ''other large firms that pose a risk to the entire economy in the event of failure.'' It would set up a new oversight council, to be led by the Treasury secretary, to advise the Fed on regulatory gaps and issues that do not fit into the traditional framework. The council would identify companies for increased supervision by the Fed because their problems could pose a systemwide shock.
 The plan would give the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation new powers to seize troubled banks and other companies when they falter and could harm the larger financial system. It would also give the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the power to put in place new rules for derivatives, including credit default swaps. 
 And it would create a federal agency to oversee consumer products like mortgages, annuities and credit cards. That proposal has already provoked a barrage of criticism from banks, which would have to face a new set of examiners in addition to the ones that already supervise them for safety and soundness.
 The president said he had rejected calls to scrap the current regulatory network, opting instead to devise reforms ''to pinpoint the structural weaknesses that allowed for this crisis.'' Mr. Obama said his goal was ''a system that works for business and consumers,'' one that will enhance ''honest, vigorous competition'' rather than reward gimmickry. At the same time, he said, he has never lost his faith in the power of the free market.

HEADLINE: Dress the Set With Tears: It's a Wrap

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: NORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif. 

 BODY:
The rattan sofa from ''The Golden Girls'' awaits its next role from a shelf deep inside the 20th Century Props warehouse here. Nearby is the futuristic shower Tom Cruise used in ''Minority Report'' and an armchair that starred with Marilyn Monroe in multiple films. Overhead: Art Deco chandeliers from ''The Aviator.''
 On Tuesday, Harvey Schwartz stood amid it all, in tears, wondering how his prop shop, which offers a vast inventory of items to be used in film and television productions, became the latest victim of a rapidly changing Hollywood. 
 Mr. Schwartz, the owner of 20th Century Props, plans to go out of business next month and auction the inventory. Battered by the surge in out-of-state movie production and the demise of scripted programming on network television, the once-thriving business -- one of a handful of its type remaining -- is failing. 
 ''I ran out of money three months ago, and I don't know what else to do,'' he said softly. ''It's terrifying. I've devoted my entire life to something that is over.''
 Set decorators are equally upset. ''The closing of 20th Century is a disaster for us,'' said Melinda Ritz, who won three Emmy Awards for her work on ''Will & Grace.'' ''Harvey is a great person, and it's one fewer place that offers one-stop shopping.'' She added, ''The fabric of Hollywood is fraying so fast that it's scary.''
 Not long ago all movie and television studios operated their own prop houses. A dozen independent companies did a brisk business filling in the gaps -- an unusual medical device here, a 1960s-era radio there. Outside prop suppliers like 20th Century also handled commercials and period needs (Mr. Schwartz has a large inventory of Art Deco items) along with special events like lavishly decorated premiere parties.
 Studios started gutting their prop departments in the 1990s to free space on their lots. Mr. Schwartz's inventory -- at last count 93,752 items, ranging from teacups to a life-size submarine -- includes the former holdings of 20th Century Fox, for instance. Walt Disney and Paramount have also jettisoned their props divisions. (Sony, Universal and Warner Brothers are the holdouts, and they're open to outside clients.)
 Independents like Mr. Schwartz and Omega Cinema Props stayed healthy -- despite runaway production and the rise of reality television -- largely because of special-events divisions. Such events made up a third of the revenue at 20th Century Props just two years ago, Mr. Schwartz said.
 But the recession has turned off that spigot. Add in a strike last year by movie and television writers and a continued slowdown in production caused by a threatened actors' strike, and 20th Century Props could no longer stay afloat.
 Mr. Schwartz said annual revenue was off by 30 percent last year; so far this year the figure is closer to 50 percent. He said he has been seeking a way to keep the collection together -- via an investor or a sale to another prop company -- but has so far come up short. The business had 28 employees at the beginning of the year; now it has 7. 
 ''I'm a dinosaur, I guess,'' Mr. Schwartz said.
 Great American Group will liquidate the company's inventory during the last week of July. The holdings are insured for about $8 million, but the value of many of the props is difficult to pin down because of the premium that memorabilia collectors will likely pay for better-known items.
 ''He's got a collector's eye and has developed an inventory unlike anybody else's,'' Ms. Ritz said of Mr. Schwartz. ''He's got quirky, interesting pieces.''
 Mr. Schwartz is a bit quirky himself. Trained as an aerospace engineer, he decided to go into the furniture business in the early 1970s, opening a small store near Beverly Hills and CBS Television City, a cluster of studios that is now home to shows like ''American Idol.''
 He developed a fondness for rattan (''Among other reasons, it was furniture I could lift by myself,'' he said) and became an expert. He was an author of a 1999 book titled ''Rattan Furniture: Tropical Comfort Throughout the House.'' He favors his shirts unbuttoned to about midchest and has a habit of hanging his reading glasses there.
 ''I'm a little bit bananas, I know,'' he said.
 Walking through the 200,000-square-foot warehouse, which is hunkered amid a smattering of auto repair shops and porno stores in this seedy San Fernando Valley suburb, Mr. Schwartz comes off as the curator of a museum that just happens to rent out its treasures.
 ''Beyonce has danced in this,'' he said, motioning to a giant plastic Champagne glass. ''See that chair way back there? Claudette Colbert sat in that in 'Cleopatra,' the 1934 version.'' He paused to point out curved desks used at Ewing Oil on ''Dallas'' -- he's not certain if J. R. sat at one of them -- and led a visitor through a maze of macabre items (jars filled with pickled piglets) to the spot where the morgue from ''The X-Files'' awaits another adventure. 
 Some of 20th Century's holdings are antiques with famous provenances outside of the movies. For instance Mr. Schwartz claims to have Merv Griffin's office chair and a giant Art Deco desk once owned by Howard Hughes (and subsequently used in ''The Aviator'').
 What are the most frequently rented items? Certain dining room chairs have gone out more than 500 times, Mr. Schwartz said. Also popular: a heart-shaped bed, which rents about twice a month. ''We don't ask too many questions with that one,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Financial Overhaul Plan, But Only a Hint of Roosevelt

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Three quarters of a century ago, President Franklin Roosevelt earned the undying enmity of Wall Street when he used his enormous popularity to push through a series of radical regulatory reforms that completely changed the norms of the financial industry. 
 Wall Street hated the reforms, of course, but Roosevelt didn't care. Wall Street and the financial industry had engaged in practices they shouldn't have, and had helped lead the country into the Great Depression. Those practices had to be stopped. To the president, that's all that mattered. 
 On Wednesday, President Obama unveiled what he described as ''a sweeping overhaul of the financial regulatory system, a transformation on a scale not seen since the reforms that followed the Great Depression.''
 In terms of the sheer number of proposals, outlined in an 88-page document the administration released on Tuesday, that is undoubtedly true. But in terms of the scope and breadth of the Obama plan -- and more important, in terms of its overall effect on Wall Street's modus operandi -- it's not even close to what Roosevelt accomplished during the Great Depression. 
 Rather, the Obama plan is little more than an attempt to stick some new regulatory fingers into a very leaky financial dam rather than rebuild the dam itself. Without question, the latter would be more difficult, more contentious and probably more expensive. But it would also have more lasting value. 
 On the surface, there was no area of the financial industry the plan didn't touch. ''I was impressed by the real estate it covered,'' said Daniel Alpert, the managing partner of Westwood Capital. The president's proposal addresses derivatives, mortgages, capital, and even, in the wake of the American International Group fiasco, insurance companies. Among other things, it would give new regulatory powers to the Federal Reserve, create a new agency to help protect consumers of financial products, and make derivative-trading more transparent. It would give the government the power to take over large bank holding companies or troubled investment banks -- powers it doesn't have now -- and would force banks to hold onto some of the mortgage-backed securities they create and sell to investors. 
 But it's what the plan doesn't do that is most notable. 
 Take, for instance, the handful of banks that are ''too big to fail''-- and which, in some cases, the government has had to spend tens of billions of dollars propping up. In a recent speech in China, the former Federal Reserve chairman -- and current Obama adviser -- Paul Volcker called on the government to limit the functions of any financial institution, like the big banks, that will always be reliant on the taxpayer should they get into trouble. Why, for instance, should they be allowed to trade for their own account -- reaping huge profits and bonuses if they succeed -- if the government has to bail them out if they make big mistakes, Mr. Volcker asked. 
 Many experts, even at the Federal Reserve, think that the country should not allow banks to become too big to fail. Some of them suggest specific economic disincentives to prevent growing too big and requirements that would break them up before reaching that point.
 Yet the Obama plan accepts the notion of ''too big to fail'' -- in the plan those institutions are labeled ''Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies'' -- and proposes to regulate them more ''robustly.'' The idea of creating either market incentives or regulation that would effectively make banking safe and boring -- and push risk-taking to institutions that are not too big to fail -- isn't even broached.
 Or take derivatives. The Obama plan calls for plain vanilla derivatives to be traded on an exchange. But standard, plain vanilla derivatives are not what caused so much trouble for the world's financial system. Rather it was the so-called bespoke derivatives -- customized, one-of-a-kind products that generated enormous profits for institutions like A.I.G. that created them, and, in the end, generated enormous damage to the financial system. For these derivatives, the Treasury Department merely wants to set up a clearinghouse so that their price and trading activity can be more readily seen. But it doesn't attempt to diminish the use of these bespoke derivatives.
 ''Derivatives should have to trade on an exchange in order to have lower capital requirements,'' said Ari Bergmann, a managing principal with Penso Capital Markets. Mr. Bergmann also thought that another way to restrict the bespoke derivatives would be to strip them of their exemption from the antigambling statutes. In a recent article in The Financial Times, George Soros, the financier, wrote that ''regulators ought to insist that derivatives be homogeneous, standardized and transparent.'' Under the Obama plan, however, customized derivatives will remain an important part of the financial system.
 Everywhere you look in the plan, you see the same thing: additional regulation on the margin, but nothing that amounts to a true overhaul. The new bank supervisor, for instance, is really nothing more than two smaller agencies combined into one. The plans calls for new regulations aimed at the ratings agencies, but offers nothing that would suggest radical revamping. 
 The plan places enormous trust in the judgment of the Federal Reserve -- trust that critics say has not really been borne out by its actions during the Internet and housing bubbles. Firms will have to put up a little more capital, and deal with a little more oversight, but once the financial crisis is over, it will, in all likelihood, be back to business as usual. 
 The regulatory structure erected by Roosevelt during the Great Depression -- including the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the establishment of serious banking oversight, the guaranteeing of bank deposits and the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated banking from investment banking -- lasted six decades before they started to crumble in the 1990s. In retrospect, it would be hard to envision even the best-constructed regulation lasting more than that. If Mr. Obama hopes to create a regulatory environment that stands for another six decades, he is going to have to do what Roosevelt did once upon a time. He is going to have make some bankers mad.

HEADLINE: What's White, Has 132 Rooms and Flies?

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The White House is bugged! 
 No, not like that. But actual flies are swarming the place, confounding housekeepers, irritating aides, even trying to feast on the president. During an East Room interview with John Harwood for CNBC and The New York Times on Tuesday, a giant fly orbited Mr. Obama's head. 
 ''I got the sucker,'' the president boasted after fatally slapping the critter on the back of his hand. 
 That scene became an instant YouTube sensation -- and resulted in a complaint from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
 ''Well, I guess it can't be said that President Obama wouldn't hurt a fly,'' lamented Alisa Mullins of PETA on the organization's blog. The animal rights group announced that it would send over one of its Katcha Bug Humane Bug Catcher contraptions to the White House in the event of ''future insect incidents.''
 White House staff members report that they and their boss have been routinely bothered by the bugs, and have seen the First Exterminator personally enforcing a no-fly zone in the West Wing. 
 ''He chases them down in the Oval with his briefing papers to smack them,'' reports Austan Goolsbee, a member of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. 
 (Question: How'd you like to be a fly on the wall in the Oval Office these days? Answer: Not so much.) 
 White House officials say that strenuous debugging measures have been undertaken in recent weeks: Anti-insect lights have been installed in the National Security Council suite and the lower press office. Staff members have been issued fly swatters, and one, Brian Mosteller, stood at the ready during Mr. Obama's television interviews on Tuesday (a lot of good he did). Some staff members have requested chemical intervention but have been denied. 
 It's not clear why there has been so much buzz in the Obama White House. The chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, who swatted at a fly in a recent interview, has blamed the opening of vents in the West Wing for the infestation, while Mr. Obama's senior adviser, David Axelrod, has blamed careless staff members who forgot to close unscreened windows, an official said. 
 There are numerous accounts of infestations in previous administrations, including a cameo by a fly during an Associated Press interview with Vice President Dick Cheney just a few days before Mr. Obama was sworn into office.
 ''We always had a lot of fly swatters at the ready, too,'' said Dana Perino, a spokesman for former President George W. Bush. ''We probably inherited the problems from the last administration.''

HEADLINE: Partisan Ire Surfaces as Senators Start Work on Health Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Partisan anger flared Wednesday as senators began the public drafting of legislation to remake the health care system. By day's end, lawmakers had settled in for a long, hard slog that may not fit with President Obama's goal of signing a bill within four months.
 ''This is about as historic as it gets for all of us,'' Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said as he opened a day-long session of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. 
 Another Senate committee, dogged by questions about the cost and complexity of the legislation, postponed its session, scheduled for next Tuesday, until after July 4. Democrats said they needed the delay by the Finance Committee to work on reducing the cost of the bill, intended to provide insurance to millions of people with no coverage.
 Mr. Dodd presided over the health committee in the absence of its chairman, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who is battling brain cancer. 
 Senator Dodd said he hoped the committee would finish its work and approve a bill by June 26. But he told his colleagues, ''My intent is not to jam anything, force anything on people.''
 Within 15 minutes after the session started Wednesday, Republicans began to protest. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said it was ridiculous to take up such a large bill without a complete cost estimate. 
 He and other Republicans demanded more details of the legislation and more time to digest it.
 Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said Democrats had made some grave errors.
 ''You advance legislation by focusing on areas of compromise, not strife,'' Mr. Hatch said. ''Now unfortunately we are beginning a partisan exercise on perhaps the most important legislation of our lives. I am personally somewhat, well, actually, very disappointed, because I wanted a thoughtful bipartisan compromise that could have become a lasting legacy for my dear friend, Ted Kennedy.''
 President Obama is pressing Congress to speed work on the measures, which embody his top legislative priorities, reining in health costs and covering the uninsured. Mr. Obama wants to sign a bill by October, but senators of both parties said it was more important to get the policy right.
 The bill before the health committee, drafted by Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Dodd, would require people to carry insurance, with federal subsidies for those who could not afford it, and would require most employers to help pay for coverage of their employees. 
 The bill would impose stringent new federal regulations on insurers and make far-reaching changes in the health care industry, which accounts for one-sixth of the economy.
 Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, the senior Republican on the health committee, said the panel was moving ''too fast to do an adequate job.''
 Mr. Dodd said, ''I appreciate the frustrations being expressed,'' but plowed ahead. ''We have a moral imperative to act,'' he said. 
 Mr. Enzi said the bill had been drafted ''with no input from Republicans,'' and he asserted, ''The bill costs too much, covers too few and will cause 10 million Americans to lose the insurance they currently enjoy.'' 
 A preliminary estimate by the Congressional Budget Office said the bill would cost $1 trillion over 10 years but leave many uninsured. The office said an early version of the Finance Committee bill would cost $1.6 trillion.
 Senate Democrats conceded that the unexpectedly high estimates had forced them to regroup, and acknowledged that they were still divided over how to pay for the legislation. 
 But Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said he did not see any setback. ''The president, I think, has laid out a timeline to get this done this year, and thinks that we're on course to do it,'' he said.
 Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, said he was on the committee when it considered President Bill Clinton's plan for universal coverage in 1993-4. ''It's sort of deja vu all over again for me,'' he said.
 Mr. Gregg said the Kennedy bill looked as if it had been written by Rube Goldberg, Karl Marx and Ira C. Magaziner, Mr. Clinton's health care coordinator. Mr. Gregg criticized a provision that would establish a Medical Advisory Council to recommend minimum benefits for insurance policies.
 ''This is the elite of the elite deciding how everybody else will get health care,'' Mr. Gregg said.
 Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, fired back. ''Our current system is a combination of Adam Smith, Darth Vader and the 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers,' '' she said. ''So I like our plan the better.'' 
 Ms. Mikulski said the Republicans' complaints reminded her of objections to the creation of Medicare in 1965. 
 ''The arguments against Medicare are the same arguments we are hearing now -- government control, centralized bureaucracy,'' she said. But, she noted, Medicare is hugely popular. 
 Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, said, ''The fight for comprehensive, universal health care is the civil rights struggle of the moment.''
 And he issued this warning: ''To all the lobbyists, all the big-money interests who give us campaign contributions and lobby so successfully with those 30-second ads on TV, I say your time has come and gone.''
 Mr. Obama and many other Democrats have called for a new public health insurance plan, to compete with private insurers.
 Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said such competition would ''hold down premiums, discipline the market and keep the private insurances industry on its toes.'' 
 But Mr. Hatch said, ''Medicare and Medicaid are already on a path to fiscal insolvency; creating a brand-new government program makes no sense.''

HEADLINE: Gay and Lesbian Leaders Say Federal Same-Sex Benefits Don't Go Far Enough

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The package of domestic partnership benefits that President Obama established for federal workers on Wednesday drew the loudest protests from some of those it was intended to help, gay men and lesbians who criticized the move as too timid. 
 The administrative memorandum extending some partnership rights to federal workers in same-sex relationships, which Mr. Obama signed late Wednesday, allows administration personnel to take leave to care for sick partners and requires the government to recognize their partners as household members when determining overseas housing allocations for State Department employees, among other things.
But several of the nation's most prominent gay and lesbian political leaders quickly attacked the president for failing to extend full health care benefits to the same-sex partners of federal workers, questioning the administration's explanation that it is precluded from doing so by the Defense of Marriage Act, which Mr. Obama had vowed to repeal during his presidential campaign. 
 Their outcry put the administration on the defensive for an action it had hoped would help address increasing complaints from gay activists who supported Mr. Obama's election but now say he is ignoring the issues he promised to address, like a repeal of the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gay men and lesbians in the military. And it has tested the balance the administration has tried to strike between avoiding hot-button cultural issues that could distract it from pushing its ambitious economic agenda and avoiding angering key liberal constituencies that expect Mr. Obama to make good on campaign promises.
 Fueling the protest, the president's move came just days after the administration filed a legal brief defending the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act -- which defines marriage as between a man and a woman only -- in a case challenging the law.
 ''I think it's insulting,'' David Mixner, a prominent gay rights advocate, said of the new benefits plan. ''Without minimizing how it will improve lives to some extent, what they said to us today is we will give you family leave, some things like that, but the most important thing, health care, we're not giving you.''
 Mr. Mixner announced earlier this week that he was boycotting a coming fund-raiser being hosted by the Democratic Party's gay and lesbian committee and featuring Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. because of what he considers the administration's inaction on gay issues, and he said the president's memorandum had not changed his mind.
 Speaking from the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr. Obama said the memorandum -- which represents his interpretation of existing law -- represented just a start. ''This is only one step,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Unfortunately, my administration is not authorized by existing federal law to provide same-sex couples with the full range of benefits enjoyed by heterosexual married couples.'' 
 Mr. Obama said he would indeed work to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, calling it ''discriminatory.'' He also announced his support for legislation that would extend full health care benefits to federal workers, a measure whose sponsors include Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and Representative Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, both of whom stood behind the president Wednesday afternoon. 
 Earlier, John Berry, the administration's director of personnel management, noted that the memorandum would extend some health-related benefits to same-sex couples. For instance, Mr. Berry said, United States medical facilities overseas would now be open to the partners of State Department employees.
 But during an occasionally contentious conference call with reporters, Mr. Berry acknowledged that some federal supervisors were already conferring some of the benefits the administration was presenting as new. He did so after a blogger on the call, John Aravosis, told him about a note on his AmericaBlog Web site from a Defense Department employee, Lisa Polyak, who said the Army had allowed her to take sick leave to care for a same-sex partner, and nonbiological child, under existing provisions.
 Mr. Berry said, however, that Mr. Obama's memorandum would ensure that such decisions would not vary among supervisors.
 ''Not every supervisor is similarly situated,'' he said. ''What the president is doing today is he is making this no longer optional; he is making this mandatory.''
 He did not address accusations from some gay and lesbian activists that the Defense of Marriage Act, which does not directly address domestic partnership rights, did not in fact preclude the administration from extending full health benefits to the same-sex partners of its employees.
 But late Wednesday, Elaine Kaplan, general counsel for the office of personnel management, said federal statutes dictated that many vital health care benefits be conferred only to ''spouses'' and children of federal employees, effectively making it a benefit of marriage as defined by the marriage act. Ms. Kaplan said the new legislation the president is supporting would remedy that prohibition. In the meantime, she said, his memorandum would cover those benefits that do not fall under the more restrictive statutory language.
 The debate resulted in a muddled message that added to the White House's struggles on gay issues this week. 
 When news leaked out Tuesday night that the president would extend benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees, some gay and lesbian leaders mistakenly took that to include health insurance and said they were let down to learn otherwise. 
 Mr. Obama's comments late Wednesday served to ameliorate some of the initial confusion and dismay. For instance, Brad Levenson, a federal public defender in California who is waging a well-publicized fight to secure health benefits for his husband, expressed anger earlier in the day at the more limited scope of the memorandum, saying it fell short of what he had been led to believe the previous evening. Mr. Levenson called back later to say he took Mr. Obama at his word that he would keep trying to do more.
 But gay and lesbian activists said suspicion remained that the president was trying to put their issues on the back burner to avoid the sort of furor that former President Bill Clinton faced when he announced early in his term that military recruiters would no longer ask applicants if they were homosexual.
 ''They decided early on that these gay issues were going to be trouble, and they decided to avoid them,'' said Richard Socarides, an adviser to the Clinton administration on gay issues. ''I think now they're paying a much steeper price than they ever thought they'd have to.''

HEADLINE: The All-American Back From Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN

 BODY:
AS you have surely noticed, all- American preppy style has come back for another goround. There is madras everything, button-downs everywhere. Nantucket reds -- washed-out pink pants -- are the new khakis; Sperry Top-Siders are more common on roof decks than top decks; and the Polo pony and the Lacoste crocodile are now but two of the critters in a zoo of polo shirt insignia.
 Lately the trend has taken on a new dimension, via the Internet, with a resurgence of interest in once obscure American brands. Alongside the familiar L. L. Bean duck boots, Brooks Brothers shirts and Ray-Ban Wayfarers, there are Filson duffel bags, Gokey boots, Alden dress shoes, Gitman oxford shirts, Quoddy Trail moccasins, Wm. J. Mills canvas totes -- to name but a few. Moribund brands like Southwick and Woolrich are being revived with new designs. And the old-school look has been furthered by popular American fashion labels -- small houses like Thom Browne, Band of Outsiders and Benjamin Bixby along with megabrands like J. Crew and Ralph Lauren.
As fashion moments go, this is as all-American as it gets, right? 
 Actually, no. What makes today's prepidemic so fascinating is how it is, surprisingly enough, so Japanese. The look has its roots in the United States, to be sure. But the spirit, rigor and execution of today's prep moment is as Japanese as Sony. One need only flip through the intriguing Japanese book ''Take Ivy,'' a collection of photographs taken in 1965 by Teruyoshi Hayashida on Eastern college campuses, to get the drift.
 ''Take Ivy'' has always been extremely rare in the United States, a treasure of fashion insiders that can fetch more than $1,000 on eBay and in vintage-book stores. But scanned images from the book have been turning up online in recent months. Ricocheting around the network of sartorially obsessed Web sites and blogs (like acontinuouslean.com and thetrad .blogspot.com), it has aroused renewed interest for its apparent prescience of preppy style. (In the United States, the word preppy came into popular use only in 1970, thanks to the best-selling book and top-grossing movie ''Love Story''; and the full flowering of preppy style would not arrive until 1980 with the best-selling ''Official Preppy Handbook.'')
 But ''Take Ivy'' was not prescient; it was totally timely, having been commissioned by Kensuke Ishizu, who was the founder of Van Jacket, an Ivy Leagueobsessed clothing line that was a sensation among Japanese teenagers and young men in the early 1960s. Mr. Ishizu was a kind of Ralph Lauren avant la lettre.
 ''You could have called it a Van look,'' recalled Daiki Suzuki, the designer and founder of Engineered Garments (channeling vintage workwear) and the designer of the revamped Woolrich Woolen Mills line (channeling 1950s New England). He remembers ''Take Ivy'' from his childhood in Japan and how the Ivy look, as it is generally called there, became basic in the '70s and '80s, as the craze for American things like Levi's and Red Wing boots accelerated. In 1989, Mr. Suzuki moved to the United States to work for a large Japanese store scouting for new American designers and obscure brands to import, like White's Boots from Washington, Russell Moccasin from Wisconsin and Duluth Pack backpacks from Minnesota.
 ''It's funny -- this authentic Americana, people in the States didn't care about it at all,'' Mr. Suzuki said. ''But I would take it back, and everybody would say, 'Wow, this is really great, what is this?' Now it's different. People here like it now.''
 HE would know. In 1999, once the Internet began eroding the specialness of his small ''Made in the USA'' finds, he founded Engineered Garments with the idea of updating vintage American pieces for modern tastes, and for five years he sold the line only in Japan. In the last couple of years Americans have come around, and now the line is a hot seller at Barneys New York.
 As curious as this American-export style of business sounds, it is not unusual. Post Overalls, a Japanese- owned line based (and made) in America since 1993, started selling here only this spring. J. Press, the venerable Ivy League clothier founded in New Haven in 1902 and bought by the Japanese fashion giant Kashiyama in 1986, has four modest stores in this country -- in Cambridge, Mass.; New Haven; New York; and Washington -- but sells roughly six times as much as American made J. Press merchandise in Japan at department stores like Isetan.
 The Japanese penchant for Americana is not merely a story of economics; it is a matter of style. It has not been unusual for Japanese men to wear the Ivy look in head-to-toe extremes once unthinkable here -- say, a blazer, tie, plaid shorts and knee socks. But given the zeal for American designers like Thom Browne and Scott Sternberg of Band of Outsiders, who tinker with old-fashioned Americana (and whose lines are made in the United States and are very popular in Japan), extremism is finally becoming fashionable here. A column in this month's GQ by a to-the-boatshoe- born Cape Codder even inveighs against the trend, labeling it a case of arrivistes going overboard. But whose Ivy look has the more valid claim?
 Mr. Suzuki remembers the first time he met Mr. Browne, when they were both starting their lines. ''He was wearing a gray suit, button-down shirt, tie, cashmere cardigan and wingtips,'' he recalled. ''I remember thinking, 'I've never seen an American dress in such Japanese style.''' Mr. Browne is flattered. ''It's amazing,'' he said. ''The Japanese get the whole perfect American thing better than Americans. They understand that it's an identifiable style around the world, this American look. We think we appreciate it, but we really don't, not like they do.''
 But that's changing. Not long ago, men scoffed at dress shorts, let alone wore them to work. Now, they are a summer norm, along with seersucker suits, ribbon belts and horn-rimmed glasses. While some men still prefer it low-key -- plain boat shoes, a faded Lacoste shirt with jeans or a khaki suit with a madras tie -- even full-on Japanese prep -- blue blazer, button-down, bermudas, loafers -- can look good if you have the attitude to carry it off.
 As fascinating and confusing as this cross-pollination is, the story of ostensible outsiders borrowing from and bettering the holy tartan has an august history. Brooks Brothers, the country's oldest operating men's clothier, and the venerable Ray-Ban brand are owned by the Italian Del Vecchio family. Erich Segal, the author of ''Love Story,'' and Lisa Birnbach, who put together ''The Official Preppy Handbook,'' are Jewish, as is Scott Sternberg of Band of Outsiders (who this week won the Council of Fashion Designers of America award for men's wear, in a tie) and, of course, the look's most famous exponent, Ralph Lauren. And, by the way, those two most prep fabrics, gingham and seersucker, came to the United States, via Britain, from India.
 Andre Benjamin, a k a Andre 3000, the designer of the bright Ivy-inspired Benjamin Bixby line (perhaps the only celebrity line with a truly fresh viewpoint), grew up in Atlanta amid the preppy boom of the '80s and early '90s. He remembers how schoolmates spent their money on clothes and cars, wearing two or three polo shirts at a time and fetishizing prepmobiles like the Volkswagen Cabriolet.
 ''I can't speak for how it's been taken up in Asian community,'' he said, ''but in the black community, you're always striving to rise above. Most black kids don't even go to college, and you justhope you can will yourself to get there.
 ''Like a lot of things, the myth is greater than the actual thing. The WASPy lifestyle, with the parents and traditions, it looks great, but appreciating it from the outside brings a whole different perspective. Ralph didn't come from it, either. It's all about having your own twist.''
 To Mr. Benjamin, the most appealing part of the old prep look was not its WASPiness but its suggestion of an easy, well-dressed freedom from anxiety, the same entitled naivete of Oliver Barrett IV, the WASPy Romeo of ''Love Story.''
 ''This golden age of Ivy League style we're talking about -- the blue blazers, the chinos, the sweatshirts, the tweed jackets -- what I like is that it's a look without looking like you thought about it. It looks like you care, but you don't care.''
 Of course, as one of the world's best and most colorfully dressed men, Mr. Benjamin cares deeply, and it shows in his clothes, as it does in all the new prep gear. And so what if it does? It may not be true of love, but as any boarding-school student can tell you, preppy means never having to say you're sorry.

HEADLINE: Obama Poll Sees Doubt on Budget And Health Care

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and DALIA SUSSMAN; Marjorie Connelly and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A substantial majority of Americans say President Obama has not developed a strategy to deal with the budget deficit, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, which also found that support for his plans to overhaul health care, rescue the auto industry and close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, falls well below his job approval ratings.
 A distinct gulf exists between Mr. Obama's overall standing and how some of his key initiatives are viewed, with fewer than half of Americans saying they approve of how he has handled health care and the effort to save General Motors and Chrysler. A majority of people said his policies have had either no effect yet on improving the economy or had made it worse, underscoring how his political strength still rests on faith in his leadership rather than concrete results. 
 As Mr. Obama finishes his fifth month in office and assumes greater ownership of the problems he inherited, Americans are alarmed by the hundreds of billions of dollars that have been doled out to boost the economy. A majority said the government should instead focus on reducing the federal deficit. 
 But with a job approval rating of 63 percent, Mr. Obama has the backing of Democrats and independents alike, a standing that many presidents would envy and try to use to build support for their policies. His rating has fallen to 23 percent among Republicans, from 44 percent in February, a sign that bridging the partisan divide may remain an unaccomplished goal.
 The poll was conducted after Mr. Obama completed his fourth international trip as president. He received high marks for his focus abroad, with 59 percent of those polled saying they approve of his approach to foreign policy. And after weeks of criticism from former Vice President Dick Cheney and other Republicans, 57 percent say they approve of how Mr. Obama has dealt with the threat of terrorism.
 The White House is entering a critical summer with Mr. Obama pledging to push his plans to revamp health care and financial regulation through Congress and Senate hearings scheduled on his first nominee to the Supreme Court. The poll suggested Americans remain patient, even as a strong majority expressed concern that they or someone in their family could lose their jobs in the next year. 
 ''My feeling is that Obama is just throwing money at things, but I don't see anything being specifically targeted,'' Lynn Adams, 62, a Republican from Troy, Mich., said in a follow-up interview. ''But I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt because he hasn't been in office long enough.''
 Judge Sonia Sotomayor, whom Mr. Obama nominated to the Supreme Court three weeks ago, is still widely unknown to the public, the poll found. A majority of people surveyed, 53 percent, said they did not know enough about Judge Sotomayor, who would be the first Hispanic justice, to say whether she should be confirmed. But 74 percent said that it was either very or somewhat important for the Supreme Court to reflect the country's diversity. 
 Before the Senate votes on her confirmation, 48 percent of people said her positions on issues like abortion and affirmative action were very important to know about. 
 The national telephone poll was conducted Friday through Tuesday with 895 adults, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 The poll highlights the political and governing challenges on the horizon for Mr. Obama, including the towering federal budget deficit, which is expected to push the national debt to levels that many economists say could threaten the economy's long-term vitality. Six in 10 people surveyed said the administration has yet to develop a clear plan for dealing with the deficit, including 65 percent of independents.
 Mr. Obama, in an interview on Tuesday with CNBC and The New York Times, said the budget deficit was ''something that keeps me awake at night.''
 While Republicans have steadily increased their criticism of Mr. Obama, particularly on the budget deficit, the poll found that the Republican Party is viewed favorably by only 28 percent of those polled, the lowest rating ever in a New York Times/CBS News poll. In contrast, 57 percent said that they had a favorable view of the Democratic Party. 
 The nomination of a Supreme Court justice, as well as the fatal shooting of an abortion doctor in Kansas late last month, injected a fresh dynamic into the national abortion debate. But the poll found essentially no change in the public's views of abortion in the last two decades, with 36 percent saying it should be generally available, 41 percent saying it should be available but under stricter limits than are now in place and 21 percent saying it should not be permitted.
 The nomination of Judge Sotomayor also has renewed discussion about affirmative action. Half of those surveyed said they favored programs that make special efforts to help minorities get ahead, a number that rises among nonwhite respondents and women. Far more, 8 in 10, said they favored programs to help low-income Americans get ahead, regardless of gender or ethnicity. 
 The issues of abortion and affirmative action sharply divide voters in each major political party. Among Democrats, 71 percent oppose overturning Roe v. Wade, while Republicans are closely divided. And 67 percent of Democrats support affirmative action programs for minorities, while 60 percent of Republicans oppose them.
 Beyond these issues, which Mr. Obama has sought to avoid becoming entangled in, he faces a divided public as he works to carry out his executive order to close the prison for terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay. The poll found that 8 in 10 expressed worry that detainees released to other countries might be involved in future attacks here.
 Half of the poll respondents said closing the prison would have no effect on protecting the nation from terror threats, but 3 in 10 said they thought it would make the United States less safe. Many of the detainees being held at the prison have not been charged, and nearly 7 in 10 people surveyed said they would support charging them or releasing them back to the country of their capture. Just 24 percent said the detainees should continue to be held without charge for as long as the government deems necessary. 
 The poll found that a wide majority of those who support closing the prison said their views would not change even if detainees were sent to maximum security prisons in the United States. 
 ''It's a bad symbol for our country: Preach one thing and do something else,'' said Roberta Hall, 73, a Democrat from Barboursville, W.Va. ''We can transfer them here. We're good at keeping prisoners. That's what we do best.''

HEADLINE: Shares End Losing Streak on Jobs Data

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained on Thursday, breaking a three-day losing streak, as data on the job market and regional manufacturing revived hope that the economy was stabilizing.
 After gaining as much as 40 percent from a 12-year closing low in early March, the S.& P. 500 has eased as investors reassessed the potential strength of an economic recovery. The day's data revived optimism, but analysts said real improvement was needed to sustain the rally.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 58.42 points, or 0.69 percent, to 8,555.60. The S.& P. 500 gained 7.66 points, or 0.84 percent, to 918.37. The Nasdaq composite index was off just 0.34 of a point, or 0.02 percent, at 1,807.72. 
 The Nasdaq ended little changed as some big-cap technology companies fell.
 Financials supported the stock market after being among the week's biggest drags. Discover Financial Services gained 4 percent, to $9.27, after it reported a smaller-than-expected operating loss as bad loans grew less than anticipated.
 Lincoln National rose 6.9 percent, to $15.92, after an upgrade from Credit Suisse, and the KBW insurance index rose 1.8 percent. The S.& P. financial index gained 2.5 percent.
 Data showed the number of people staying on jobless benefits fell for the first time since January, while manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region contracted less than expected in June.
 ''The data supports the case of those looking for the bottom of the economy in this quarter,'' said Jim Awad, managing director at Zephyr Management in New York.
 Research in Motion, the BlackBerry maker, fell as much as 5 percent in some after-hours trading after it posted quarterly results that were better than expected but gave an outlook that disappointed some investors.
 Health care companies, deemed better positioned to withstand a still uncertain economy, also buoyed the market. Merck & Company rose 3.6 percent, to $25.65.
 ''People are hedging their bets by saying we're going to stay in, but stay in defensively to protect their gains,'' Mr. Awad said.
 Friday is the end of the two-day quadruple witching period, referring to the expiration and settlement of June stock and index futures and options, which may increase volatility. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index was down 4.8 percent, but slightly above the psychologically important 30 level.
 On the downside, Caterpillar lost 2.1 percent, to $34.08, after it said retail sales of its machines had fallen at a faster pace in May. The stock was the Dow's biggest drag.
 Government data showed that while the amount of workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose last week, the number of people collecting aid after the initial week experienced its biggest decline since November 2001.
 Though regional manufacturing contracted in June, it was far less severe than the previous month, adding to stabilization hopes.
 After a nearly 4 percent pullback over the last three sessions, the broad S.& P. 500 is up 35.7 percent from its 12-year closing low on March 9.
 Interest rates rose for a second consecutive day. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 1 3/32 to 94 8/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.83 percent, up from 3.69 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Swiss Regulators Ponder a Way to Restrict Banks Regarded as 'Too Big to Fail'

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

 BODY:
Swiss financial regulators said Thursday that they were considering assuming new emergency powers that would allow them to break up large banks to wind down troubled business units that are not essential to the economy.
 The Swiss National Bank, in its 2009 financial stability report, said it wanted to develop a better approach than bailouts to deal with crises at big banks whose collapse would threaten the whole financial system.
 ''There can be no more taboos, given our experiences of the last two years,'' Philipp Hildebrand, the vice chairman of the bank, said in Berne, Switzerland. Swiss authorities, including the central bank and the Financial Market Supervisory Authority, signaled an aggressive approach to the ''too big to fail'' problem that has vexed policy makers in Europe and the United States. 
 Switzerland is home to two such banks, UBS and Credit Suisse. UBS, hit hard by bad investments linked to the mortgage market in the United States, has received a government bailout. Credit Suisse has also had losses, but arranged a recapitalization through private other sources.
 The quandary, highlighted by the collapse of Lehman Brothers last year, is that letting banks fail as a result of their mistakes can strangle companies and consumers not directly involved in banking.
 Swiss officials have viewed the ''too big to fail'' problem with more alarm than other European countries, principally because UBS and Credit Suisse are so large in proportion to the national economy. Also, Switzerland's worldwide status as a wealth management center has suffered from the troubles at UBS.
 ''They have a great reputation to protect,'' said Harald Benink, a finance professor at Tilburg University in the Netherlands and chairman of the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee, a private advisory group. ''It's a different ballgame in Switzerland.''
 Mr. Hildebrand was concerned that developing an international procedure for winding down a large bank in an orderly manner would be ''challenging and time-consuming,'' given that many national jurisdictions would be involved.
 So, he said, Swiss officials would, ''in close collaboration with the banks affected,'' try to agree on a domestic process for doing so in a crisis. He also hinted that authorities would simply limit the size of banks if they did not cooperate with regulators.
 ''If significant progress is not achieved within a reasonable time frame, measures that address the size of the banks should also be examined,'' Mr. Hildebrand said.
 The central bank also made clear it would support the Financial Market Supervisory Authority's efforts to impose lower leverage ratios, the relationship of liabilities to assets, on banks. The bank endorsed a ratio of 20 to 1, far lower than the ratios of 33 to 1 at Credit Suisse and 60 to 1 at UBS.
 Some banks have argued that such limits do not take into account the quality of a bank's assets, and that institutions with gilt-edged assets -- solid corporate loans or government bonds -- should be allowed higher leverage ratios.
 Alex Biscaro, a spokesman for Credit Suisse, said the bank is in a ''close and productive dialogue with the regulator'' and views the central bank report as a first step in discussing new ideas. He added that cooperation with other regulators would be vital.
 ''The systemic issues need to be solved on an international level,'' Mr. Biscaro said.

HEADLINE: DNA Tests Prove Michigan Man, Searching for Origins, Was Not Kidnapped Toddler

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY and KAREN ANN CULLOTTA; Monica Davey reported from Kalkaska, and Karen Ann Cullotta from Chicago.

DATELINE: KALKASKA, Mich. 

 BODY:
In a dizzying matter of hours this week, the story of John Barnes, a local man who said he thought he was abducted as a toddler from his real parents outside a Long Island grocery store in the 1950s, bubbled forth in this pine-filled Michigan village of a few thousand people and raced onto a national television stage.
 Mr. Barnes, a quiet, polite, unemployed man whose wife works at a local grocery store, said he had long felt different from the people he was told were his parents and siblings. He had been pondering his origins for years, and his Internet research led him to the sister of a child kidnapped decades ago and miles away. 
 By Wednesday, reporters from around the country swarmed this quiet village near Traverse City known for snowmobiling and fishing. On Thursday morning, Mr. Barnes told his story on NBC's ''Today,'' along with his would-be sister.
 And Thursday night, federal authorities announced that DNA tests had showed that Mr. Barnes was not the boy who had been kidnapped, and people here concluded that Mr. Barnes was, in all likelihood, just Mr. Barnes of Kalkaska after all.
 By then, though, the story had captivated residents of Kalkaska -- some hopeful that it was true, others smirking at it all along. It also left a giant rift within the Barnes family, who said they learned of their relative's puzzling claim only when reporters began appearing at their doors. 
 ''It's a mystery to me,'' Lynn Jenkins, a 76-year-old potato farmer, said to his friends inside the Trout Town Country Cafe on Thursday morning. The group debated whether Mr. Barnes's blond hair and bone structure matched the Barnes family's looks, talked about what kind of DNA testing might convince them either way, and pondered how, if the story were true, the Barnes family would have ended up with a kidnapped child. 
 There have been many leads over the years in the case of Steven Damman, who was 2 years and 10 months old when he vanished on Oct. 31, 1955, from outside the Long Island grocery store as his mother shopped inside. The boy's sister, Pamela, a 7-month-old baby, left in a carriage beside him, was not taken. 
 At the time, the case drew enormous notice. Bloodhounds and 2,000 people searched for the boy, while sound trucks broadcast his description and people were told to search their vehicles' trunks. False sightings and fake ransom notes came. Hundreds of people called in tips, none of which led to an answer. 
 As the years went by, the kidnapping rarely was discussed within the Damman family. But a few months ago, Pamela Damman Horne, Steven's sister, now in her 50s, received a handwritten letter and a clump of photographs from Mr. Barnes, a stranger. Ms. Horne and Mr. Barnes submitted to a private, preliminary DNA test which, the authorities say, had not ruled out the possibility they were related and which led to the more sophisticated tests by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
 On Thursday, Mr. Barnes told ''Today'' about his long-held feelings about the Barnes family. 
 ''I just knew I didn't come from these people,'' he said. 
 But at the home of Dick Barnes, 75, who raised John Barnes along with an older brother, Richard Jr., and a younger sister, Cheryl, the claims seemed astounding and absurd. Cheryl Barnes, 50, found herself greeting reporters at her father's front porch and trying to prove that her brother was her brother.
 ''This is all out of nowhere,'' she said. ''He's always saying something, and now it's this? Is he saying our dad is a kidnapper?''
 In town, Josh Perttunen, the editor of the local newspaper, The Leader and the Kalkaskian, said he believed most locals had hoped the story would prove true. ''I think we've all had a moment in our lives where we didn't fit in,'' said Mr. Perttunen, 27. 
 By Thursday's end, though, the answer had reached Kalkaska and well beyond. In Newton, Iowa, Jerry Damman, the father of the boy who vanished, sounded tired. 
 ''I have mixed feelings about this,'' said Mr. Damman, 78. ''Naturally, it's a disappointment in some ways.''

HEADLINE: Cutting Off Mom & Pop Credit

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
Louis Licata has shelved plans to hire three more employees for his Cleveland law firm. Jeannie Macone, of Florida, is cutting back on inventory for her trinket and home decor business. In Ohio, Patrick Allen has slashed employee travel and begun paying cash for work dinners with clients of the marketing firm that he started from scratch.
 A crackdown on credit limits by card companies is squeezing the nation's 27 million small businesses, exacerbating the problems brought on by a stagnant economy.
 Owning a small business has always been a challenge -- half wind up failing within the first few years. But the financial crisis has dealt them a one-two punch, as big banks cut the credit card lines that many entrepreneurs were forced to lean on when a once-abundant supply of loans dried up. 
 As of April, 59 percent of America's small firms relied on credit cards to help finance their day-to-day operations, up from 44 percent at the end of last year, according to the National Small Business Association. 
 The number of small-business owners who depend on a credit card to buy items as varied as paper clips and heavy equipment has climbed steadily over the years, from just 16 percent in 1993. Today, that group makes up 11 percent of the revenue for Visa and MasterCard, from 3 percent in 1998, according to David Robertson, who publishes The Nilson Report on the credit card industry.
 But credit card terms have worsened sharply with the recession: three-quarters of small business said they have seen a large cut in limits over the last six months. That would not be so bad if other forms of credit were easily accessible. But banks and credit card companies, which opened their coffers when the economy was flourishing, are now pulling back from nearly everything that hints of risk. 
 ''I'm a business in a bad time that wants to expand,'' said Mr. Licata, who added that he had been unable to get loans at Cleveland's banks since the recession set in. Recently, the limit on three of the credit cards he uses for his law firm was slashed by a total of $60,000, he said, dousing plans to enlarge his business. 
 Of course, consumers have been squeezed by higher interest rates and reduced credit lines by credit card companies, too. But small businesses were not included in the credit card reform legislation signed into law last month by President Obama, which limits excessive fees and interest rate increases on existing balances starting next year. A bipartisan coalition of senators is seeking to extend the legislation to small business.
 ''The way that the economy is going to come out of a recession is not by big business hiring but by small business hiring,'' said Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, who is championing the measure. Denying small businesses access to credit is having ''spiraling'' effect on the economy, she added.
 Bankers say that credit card companies have no choice but to reduce credit to small businesses. Credit card delinquency among small-business owners is more than 12 percent, roughly two percentage points higher than credit card charge-offs among consumers, according to Mr. Robertson of The Nilson Report.
 Kenneth J. Clayton, senior vice president of card policy for the American Bankers Association, said applying the credit card reform law to small businesses would further crimp credit, since it would limit credit card companies' ability to manage risk. Already, he said, the companies have had to restrict credit to small businesses because of rising defaults and uncertainty.
 ''They are looking very closely at the ability of small business to pay them back,'' he said. ''They have to. They have no choice.''
 Tom Sclafani, a spokesman for American Express, said credit lines offered when the economy was booming might not be appropriate when growth contracts. The company has been cutting credit lines based in part on the overall debt level of the business.
 ''What we are trying to do is strike a balance between a customer's spending needs and managing credit risk,'' he said.
 American Express offered the first credit card tailored to small business 20 years ago. Other companies came onto the playing field over the last decade, when a healthy economy turned small businesses into a lucrative source of new accounts as the consumer market became saturated.
 Credit card companies became increasingly aggressive in soliciting new business. Many banks began offering their own credit cards to small businesses, in lieu of loans. And many small vendors began preferring, or even requiring, payments with credit cards.
 Where small businesses had traditionally relied on bank loans, personal savings or relatives to help pay for their operations, credit cards provided additional flexibility and ease. Low introductory offers and rewards programs were icing on the cake.
 The market grew so rapidly that at least one company, Pennsylvania-based Advanta, decided to focus exclusively on credit cards for small-business customers. By 2006, just five years after it was founded, its profit from business credit cards surged 54 percent over the previous year. Eventually, more than one million small businesses took an Advanta card. 
 Then the economy went into a tailspin, and took Advanta's fortunes with it. The company last month announced that it would no longer pay for additional purchases, leaving many customers in a bind. 
 Now, small businesses ''are really having to scramble because often they don't have the kind of flexibility they had before,'' said Todd McCracken, president of the National Small Business Association. Further, credit scores of small businesses have been hurt as banks cut credit limits, making it even harder to get other types of credit.
 ''It feeds on itself,'' he said.
 Mr. Allen, the owner of the financial and insurance marketing firm in Ohio, said he recently took some insurance agents on an Alaska cruise where he tried to charge drinks and several side trips on his credit card, only to be denied. To his astonishment, his limit had been cut with no notice. 
 After he returned to Ohio, Mr. Allen said he met some clients for dinner. Normally, he said he would have whipped out a credit card to pay the bill. Instead, he paid in cash. Mr. Allen said he has also scaled back travel because credit was tight and business was slower than normal.
 ''You've got to play a balancing act,'' Mr. Allen said. ''This is going to be a moving target.''
 Mrs. Macone, the owner of the business in Florida selling equestrian-themed trinkets and home decor to retail outlets, said she had to retool her business in part because the credit lines on her cards were suddenly slashed, even though she maintained she paid her bills on time. Traditionally, she has relied on her credit cards to purchase inventory, which she then paid off as her customers settled their accounts. 
 But last fall, Ms. Macone, who took out a credit card with Advanta, opened her bill to find the company had raised her interest rate above 30 percent. A short time later, Advanta reduced her spending limit from $30,000 to $5,000. ''When you have a business, it's like, '$5,000? Please, what good is that?' ''
 Advanta said it was responding to worsening conditions. ''Across the card industry, card issuers have been increasing interest rates and reducing credit lines to protect themselves against a riskier economic environment,'' said Amy Holderer, a spokeswoman. ''We are no different.''
 Ms. Macone said she has had to lay off three part-time workers who used to assemble orders for shipment in her warehouse, and cut the hours of two other employees. ''I'm the warehouse help now -- my husband and I,'' she said. ''I'm back out there picking orders. I haven't picked orders in 10 years.''

HEADLINE: No Refund or Exchange To 42,500 With Tickets

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The rain that washed out play at Bethpage Black on Thursday left more than a few people scrambling for Plan B, including the 42,500 fans who had tickets for the day's action.
 Late Thursday, United States Golf Association officials decided to stick with their policy of not refunding or exchanging tickets that were designated for days when rain washed out play. On the event's Web site, a small notice was posted saying, ''Thursday tickets will not be refunded or exchanged.''
 Because rain halted the event so early Thursday, and because more rain is expected, association officials met to consider whether to allow people with Thursday tickets to attend another day of the tournament, not unlike what baseball teams do when some games are rained out. 
 Fans were told early Thursday not to expect to use their tickets on other days. Keith Nelson, a golf fan from Long Island, got as far as the Long Island Rail Road station in Farmingdale before he was told that the day's golf was rained out.
 After returning home, Nelson called the United States Open Championship phone number at Bethpage State Park. An operator told him his two tickets, which cost $150 each and included access to the Trophy Club, were unusable.
 ''It's an obscene amount of money to pay for this,'' Nelson said. ''Like most people and corporations, they are doing this because they can.''
 3 PARKING LOTS CLOSE Three parking lots at Bethpage State Park -- D, F and R -- will be closed for the rest of the tournament because of the rain, the United States Golf Association said.
 Fans with parking passes for lots D and F and volunteers with passes for lot R should go to general spectator parking areas at Jones Beach, where they can use complimentary shuttle buses to Bethpage. General spectator shuttles begin at 5:30 a.m.
 RESALES SINK The fans who did manage to slog around Bethpage Black on Thursday are not the only ones having potential ticket problems. Apparently, people trying to resell their tickets to Sunday's championship round are, too.
 According to FanSnap.com, a Web site that monitors nearly five dozen ticket resellers, the average price of a ticket being offered for sale to Sunday's play, which for now is the final round, had fallen by 40 percent.
 Of the roughly 400 Sunday tickets for sale online Thursday, the average price had fallen to $128.15. Prices have fallen steadily since early April, when the average price hit a high of $220.
 Every day of the tournament, 42,500 fans are allowed on the course. Some fans buy weeklong passes; others buy tickets for individual days. Tickets to championship rounds have a face value of $100, although tickets with access to premium clubs cost more.
 The steady decline in prices leading up to Sunday's round is not unusual for a single event like a golf tournament, said Michael Janes, FanSnap's chief executive. The first fans who try to sell their tickets aim high and then lower their offers as the event nears.
 But ''versus some of the storied tournaments in recent years, the prices are substantially lower, and you have to chalk that up to the economy,'' said Janes, who added that tickets to the Masters in April followed the same pattern.
 Janes said buyers play a game of chicken with sellers as an event approaches, with buyers hoping that sellers panic and lower their prices. That could happen if rain forces the United States Golf Association to push the final round back to Monday or even Tuesday, when many ticket holders would have to go to work and be unable to attend.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Jobless Numbers Fall, But New Claims Rise

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The total number of people on the unemployment insurance rolls dropped for the first time since early January, the government said on Thursday, while new claims for benefits rose slightly. 
 The report showed that job losses were easing after companies made deep cuts earlier this year. 
 But nearly half of the recipients at the end of last month had exhausted the 26 weeks of benefits provided under the regular state-level programs without finding work, according to Labor Department data. That was a record; the number was about 36 percent in December 2007, when the recession began.
 ''It is unlikely that new hiring has picked up in any meaningful fashion,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief economist with MFR, a consulting firm, wrote in a note to clients.
 The department said the total unemployment insurance rolls fell by 148,000, to 6.69 million, in the week ended June 6, the largest drop in more than seven years.
 The decrease also breaks a string of 21 consecutive increases in continuing claims, the last 19 of which were records. A decline in continuing claims several weeks ago was later revised higher. 
 Initial claims rose by 3,000, to a seasonally adjusted 608,000, in the week ended June 13, above analysts' expectations. The four-week average, which smooths fluctuations, fell by 7,000, to 615,750. Continuing claims data lag initial claims by one week.
 The four-week average is at its lowest since mid-February. It has dropped by about 40,000, from nearly 659,000 in early April, its peak for the recession. 
 In another encouraging sign, the Conference Board said on Thursday that its index of leading economic indicators rose in May for the second consecutive month, after seven consecutive declines. The index rose 1.2 percent last month and by the same amount in the six-month period ended in May, the first time that measure has grown since April 2007.
 A Conference Board economist, Ken Goldstein, said if those trends continued, a ''slow recovery'' should start before the end of the year, but he cautioned that the job market would take longer to rebound.
 Millions of Americans are receiving unemployment compensation under an emergency federal program authorized by Congress last summer and extended by the Obama administration's stimulus package.
 About 2.4 million people received benefits under that program in the week ended May 30, an increase of more than 102,000 from the previous week. That was in addition to the 6.7 million people receiving benefits under the 26-week program typically provided by states.
 Among the states, Pennsylvania reported the largest increase in initial claims for the week ended June 6. It attributed the increase of 6,861 claims to layoffs in the construction, service and transportation industries. The next largest increases were in Florida, Ohio, California and New York.
 Arkansas had the largest decrease, of 1,206, which it attributed to fewer layoffs in the auto industry. The next largest drops were in Puerto Rico, Wisconsin, Arizona and Nebraska.

HEADLINE: Dams and Salmon

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Wind, Water and Fish'' (Business Day, June 12): Special interests trying to split wildlife conservationists from renewable-energy advocates say we can't have wind power without fish-killing dams. They have no plan for cutting carbon emissions or saving endangered salmon. 
 The four lower Snake River dams in the article provide little of the region's power but threaten several salmon species essential to the Northwest's economy and treaty obligations. By 2050, the Northwest will need about 25,000 megawatts of new conservation or power resources to meet rising needs and retire coal plants responsible for much of the region's climate emissions. 
 The dams' 1,000 megawatts of generation are insignificant to making climate progress. Warming, however, magnifies the importance of dam removal to save salmon. Salmon recovery and new clean energy are both essential to climate progress.

HEADLINE: For Colleges, Small Cutbacks Are Adding Up to Big Savings

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
College life may look different in the not-so-distant future: Students squinting out dirtier windows, faculty offices with full wastebaskets and no phones, sporting events in which opponents never meet, and paper course catalogs existing only as artifacts of the wasteful old days. 
 While colleges and universities slashed their spending this year with wrenching layoffs, hiring freezes and halts in construction projects, they whittled away at costs with smaller, quirkier economies, too: 
 At the University of Washington, the communications department faculty did away with their landlines. (''Phones were our biggest line item,'' said David Domke, the department chairman. ''We've still got landlines in common areas and for staff, but we're saving about $1,100 a month by getting rid of faculty phones.'') 
 At Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., the women's swim team held a ''virtual swim meet'' with Bryn Mawr College, in Pennsylvania, about 112 miles away. Each team swam in its home pool, then compared times to determine the winners. (''We probably saved $900 on bus travel,'' said William G. Durden, Dickinson's president.) 
 At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the traditional bus tour of the state for new faculty members was suspended this year. (''In a recession, people don't want to see 100 faculty members traveling around and staying in hotels,'' said Holden Thorp, the chancellor.) 
 Across the country, colleges have come up with a host of ideas that, taken together, stand as higher education's household hints for living on a budget. 
 Campus life is getting a bit dirtier as housekeeping standards are relaxed. Oberlin College in Ohio saved $22,300 by scaling back on window washing, and Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., is power washing its sidewalks and windows once a year instead of twice. Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., is having office trash picked up weekly instead of daily, a change that eliminated three custodian jobs.
 And in a move that directly involves academics, Carleton, which recently eased teachers' course loads to five per teacher from six, now plans to return to six courses to save money.
 After years of boom times that led to competition among colleges to provide more luxurious dorm rooms and student centers, some perks of campus life have gone by the wayside. Dickinson, for example, is saving $150,000 by cutting back on free laundry service for students and an additional $75,000 by eliminating free ESPN and HBO in student rooms. 
 Whittier College in California cut one day of its new-student orientation, saving $50,000. Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., put a cap on students' free printing in libraries and labs, limiting them to $60 worth of free printing per semester. Next year, students will be limited to $50 per semester. 
 Most widespread, most proudly announced -- and, it seems, most likely to have nicknames -- are cost-cutting programs that help sustainability. Hundreds of colleges and universities are turning down their thermostats to save on heating, in programs like ''Chill-Out'' at Davidson College in North Carolina.
 Cafeterias, too, are saving money, cutting food waste and reducing hot-water and detergent costs by eliminating trays. When Whittier began ''Trayless Tuesdays'' last fall, lunchtime food waste dropped to 4.6 ounces per student from 7.4 ounces -- and the college saved almost $30,000 a semester after going fully trayless in the spring. 
 Many colleges are reducing their use of paper by putting admissions brochures, course catalogs and phone directories online instead of on paper. 
 Colleges are also installing low-flow shower heads and energy-saving light bulbs and holding contests to see which dorm can most reduce its electricity costs.
 At Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove, Pa., the contest resulted in almost $3,000 saved as students competed in turning off lights and unplugging chargers and printers. Students in participating dorms got 25 percent of the savings, $730, for pizza parties and other programs. 
 Davidson saved more than $10,000 by switching from bottled water to tap at most college events. 
 Many colleges are rebuilding computers instead of buying new ones, limiting the purchase and use of campus vehicles and scheduling more videoconferences and less travel. 
 Room phones and voicemail systems are fading away now that the vast majority of students depend on their cellphones. Cornell College, in Mount Vernon, Iowa, estimates that it saved $40,000 by not replacing old voicemail equipment. 
 Rhodes College in Memphis economizes -- and gives students work experience -- by hiring students in 25 professional staff positions, saving $725,000 a year. And the College of Wooster in Ohio is trying to hold on to financially struggling students, and their tuition dollars, by offering minimum-wage summer jobs in its ''WooCorps,'' which has almost 200 students painting rooms, landscaping and growing vegetables this summer. WooCorps students will get an extra $1,000 in their financial aid packages -- and help the college complete more maintenance projects than usual. 
 Many colleges are cutting food-service options, too. Wooster shuttered one of its two dining halls, and Oberlin reduced the operating hours at its cafe. 
 Washington & Jefferson College in Washington, Pa., is no longer serving breakfast at trustees' meetings; instead, it will give trustees passes to the cafeteria. Faculty members there will now have planning sessions over brown-bag lunches instead of dinner at the president's house. 
 To some, little cuts are more energizing than irritating. 
 ''We found a way of saving money that doesn't hurt the student experience, and I think everybody's happy,'' said Mr. Domke of the University of Washington. ''With cellphones and e-mail, everyone can get hold of us. People think it's funny that we're the communications department and we cut phones. But it's just a symbol, an old technology.'' 
 He paused before continuing, ''I've suggested to geography that they may want to get rid of their globes.''

HEADLINE: Peru's Natives Hail Decision To Overturn Logging Rules

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Andrea Zarate contributed reporting from Lima, Peru.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
Peru's Congress on Thursday overturned two decrees by President Alan Garcia that were aimed at opening large areas of the Peruvian Amazon to logging, dams and oil drilling but set off protests by indigenous groups this month in which dozens died. 
 The move appeared to ease tensions with the indigenous groups, which had continued with their protests and road blockades in parts of Peru despite Congress's decision to suspend the decrees last month. After the vote on Thursday, however, some indigenous leaders said they would lift the scattered blockades and halt the protests. 
 ''Today is a historic day for all indigenous people and for the nation of Peru,'' said Daysi Zapata, a leader of the Peruvian Jungle Inter-Ethnic Development Association, a group representing more than 300,000 people from Peru's indigenous groups. 
 The apparent end to the impasse came after at least 24 police officers and 10 civilians were killed in clashes and acts of retaliation in northern Bagua Province, some of Peru's bloodiest political violence since a two-decade war ended in 2000. 
 The decrees, issued by Mr. Garcia as part of a regulatory overhaul for a trade deal with the United States, were intended to open parts of jungle to investment and allow companies to bypass indigenous communities to attain permits for petroleum, biofuels and hydroelectric projects. 
 Other disputed decrees by Mr. Garcia remain in effect, raising the prospect of new protests. Still, Mr. Garcia acknowledged in a speech late Wednesday that his government had made a crucial mistake by not including native groups in discussions over the decrees before he issued them. 
 The repeal of the decrees and the apology by Mr. Garcia open a new phase of uncertainty in Peru, where economic growth is sharply declining amid a decline in commodities prices.

 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE TREASURE OF ULYSSES DAVIS,' through Sept. 6. Ulysses Davis (1914-1990) was a Savannah, Ga., barber who whittled and carved wooden sculptures in his shop when business was slow. Organized by the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, this show is by far the largest presentation of Mr. Davis's sculpture to be seen outside Savannah and the first to reveal the full scope of his imagination. His best-known works, carvings of historical figures, take a backseat to hybrid beasts and hydra-headed figures. It makes clear that he wasn't just a patriotic folk artist, or an African-American artist affirming his heritage, or an inward-looking, visionary artist. He was all of these, which is to say that no single cliche of ''outsider'' art quite fits him. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20090618 
 ASIA SOCIETY: YANG FUDONG: 'SEVEN INTELLECTUALS IN A BAMBOO FOREST,' through Sept. 13. Presented in its five-hour entirety for the first time in a United States museum, Mr. Yang's hypnotic, five-part black-and-white movie, ''Seven Intellectuals in a Bamboo Forest,'' tracks the dreamlike meanderings of a group of fashion-model-pretty young people, from a breathtaking mountain summit to a busy city where the disjunctive imagery becomes increasingly surrealistic and comical. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street , (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Ken Johnson)20090618
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'REFLECTIONS ON THE ELECTRIC MIRROR: NEW FEMINIST VIDEO,' through Jan. 10. Q: What is feminist video? A: A good way to reduce overcrowding in museums. Unless, that is, you are referring to this entertaining exhibition of recent videos by nine artists featuring the creators themselves as performers. Works by Klara Liden, Kate Gilmore, Cathy Begien and the team of Harry Dodge and Stanya Kahn are variously funny, dark and poetic. Starring in antique-looking, silent-movie-style commercials, Shannon Plumb is a wonderfully agile physical comedian. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090618
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GUSTAVE CAILLEBOTTE: IMPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS FROM PARIS TO THE SEA,' through July 5. Thirty-some years ago, the museum had a big success with a Caillebotte retrospective that more or less introduced American audiences to an artist who was an Impressionist by association rather than by style or temperament. His three best-known pictures, ''The Floor Scrapers,'' ''The Pont de l'Europe'' and ''Paris Street, Rainy Day,'' all grand urban scenes from the late 1870s, are absent from this show, which is a more modest enterprise than a survey, with emphasis falling on less-focused late work. But Caillebotte was a painter as interesting for his weaknesses as for his strengths, and any exposure is valuable. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20090618
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FASHIONING FELT,' through Sept. 7. Tribute is paid to the world's oldest textile (no loom required) in all its sturdy, cosseting, beautiful, shape-shifting, dye-friendly majesty. The show includes contemporary furnishings, garments, jewelry and room dividers, as well as two large installation works. The felt runs from raw to cooked -- that is furry to gossamer -- and in some of the most intriguing instances it is mated with lacquer, plastic, LED lights, metal or coral beads, as well as silk, linen or cotton. There are episodes of frivolity. A few earlier works -- including a Mongolian runner and a saddle blanket -- reunite function and decoration and distort familiar motifs in wonderful ways. 2 East 91st Street , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)20090618
 FRICK COLLECTION: 'PORTRAITS, PASTELS, PRINTS: WHISTLER IN THE FRICK COLLECTION,' through Aug. 23. This summer's refurbishment of the Frick's East Gallery, where four full-length portraits by James Abbott McNeill Whistler (1834-1903) normally hang, has occasioned a small celebration of Whistler's art. The four portraits have been moved into the Oval Room, where they are joined by a seascape; etchings and pastels of Venice are on view in the Cabinet Room. Both displays reinforce a suspicion about Whistler: that despite his oft-professed regard for the abstract qualities of music -- all those ''symphonies,'' ''arrangements'' and ''nocturnes'' -- he had a rare talent for conveying specific places and personalities. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)20090618
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AVEDON FASHION: 1944-2000,' through Sept. 20. The first museum retrospective devoted to Richard Avedon's fashion photography exudes a contagious joie de vivre. With postwar Paris as a stage set, Avedon made fashion photography new by adding movement and then narrative to his images, along with ironic self-awareness and a buoyant exuberance. The best of his early images are as perfect as the best work of Jackson Pollock or Jasper Johns from this period and as profoundly representative of it. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0000, www.icp.org. (Smith)20090618
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'RECLAIMED: PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF JACQUES GOUDSTIKKER,' through Aug. 2. This show of paintings returned to the family of Goudstikker, a prominent Dutch gallery owner who died while fleeing the Nazis, is many exhibitions in one. It's a portrait of an enormously successful art dealer who shaped tastes and markets between the wars. It's a marriage of Northern Baroque and Southern Renaissance painting. Most of all, it's an extraordinary, continuing tale of looting and restitution. At the center of all these stories is a small black notebook, used by Goudstikker to catalog his inventory of some 1,400 works and now on display, in actual and digitized form, at the Jewish Museum. Other highlights include a landscape by Salomon von Jacobsz Ruysdael and a portrait by Rembrandt's pupil Ferdinand Bol. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090618
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THEY CALLED ME MAYER JULY: PAINTED MEMORIES OF A JEWISH CHILDHOOD IN POLAND BEFORE THE HOLOCAUST,' through Oct. 1. Introducing the reluctant painter and accidental memoirist Mayer Kirschenblatt, now 92, who has devoted the last two decades to documenting life between the wars in and around the provincial city of Opatow (Apt in Yiddish), Poland. Wrought with irresistible detail and folk-art dispatch, the paintings begin with his mother's kitchen and reflect an omnivorous curiosity about everyday everything, aided by an apparently photographic memory. Labels pick up where the paintings leave off; words and images combine in a marvel of a book accomplished in collaboration with the artist's daughter, a folklorist whose career choice was shaped by her father's stories. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Smith)20090618
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'FRANCIS BACON: A CENTENARY RETROSPECTIVE,' through Aug. 16. This 66-work survey starts with the stagy existentialism of Bacon's early work (the semihuman fiends, screaming popes, flanks of beef) and proceeds to the effulgent colors, insistent rhythms and true anguish of his grand triptychs and portraits. It suggests that his greatest achievement was his ability to paint convincingly men having sex and sometimes making love. As his hero Picasso had done for men and women, Bacon turned sexual passion into a pictorial event, using paint on canvas with finesse and no small sense of drama, while operating under cover of modernism. For once, the male gaze turned emphatically selfward. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090618
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LIVING LINE: SELECTED INDIAN DRAWINGS FROM THE SUBHASH KAPOOR GIFT,' through Sept. 7. This almost supernaturally beautiful exhibition presents 40 mostly small drawings by Indian miniaturists of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Rendered with amazing skill, the subjects include bearded aristocrats and bejeweled women; hunting scenes; wild animals and mythic beasts fighting; and gods, goddesses and demons ascending and descending. The art of drawing does not get much better than this. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090618
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090618
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE PICTURES GENERATION, 1974-1984,' through Aug. 2. With this historical survey, the Met tackles a subject in American contemporary art -- namely, a critical and innovative body of media-influenced work produced between two major economic booms -- that has been begging for full-scale museum attention, and gives it the full old master treatment. Much of the art itself -- painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, video, installation, prints, music and books by 30 artists, most of them still active and caught young here -- continues to look good. There are things to quarrel with, from the sweeping ''generation'' concept to a surprising, un-Met-like factual error in the wall labels: the original ''Pictures'' show had five artists, not four; one, Philip Smith, has been deliberately excised here in the interest of writing a neater history. Still, the show is a big step into the pertinent present for this museum. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090618
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM,' through Oct. 25. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending 130 feet from one end of the open-air deck to the other and rising 29 feet overhead. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and deposited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090618
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,' through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090618
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'AERNOUT MIK,' through July 27. Something is happening in this Dutch artist's videos, but you don't know what it is. Displayed on single flat screens or as multiple projections on custom-built walls in various locations at the museum, they seem to document chaotic, emotionally charged, newsworthy situations involving scores of people. As you watch, you keep hoping to discover what exactly is the cause of the commotion, but no clarification arrives. They are by turns mesmerizing, tantalizing and frustrating. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20090618
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WHAT WAS GOOD DESIGN? MOMA'S MESSAGE, 1944-1956,' through Nov. 30. With 102 objects and excellent labels, the Modern explores its role as arbiter of postwar American design, when, channeling the Bauhaus, it deemed good, affordable design a human right. Its campaign included exhibitions titled ''What is Good Design?,'' design competitions and use of the MoMA seal of approval by selected department stores. Signature items like the Eames storage unit and the Chemex coffee maker mingle with surprises like a back-to-basics chair of string and wood by, of all people, Alexey Brodovitch, Harper Bazaar's influential art director. The prevailing sense of beauty, restraint and economy is an implicit rebuke of today's inane material excesses. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090618
 NEUE GALERIE: 'BRUCKE: THE BIRTH OF EXPRESSIONISM IN DRESDEN AND BERLIN, 1905-1913,' through June 29. The original bad boys of 20th-century German art are featured in this visually aggressive show, specifically Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Max Pechstein and their driven, putative leader, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. Together they revived a rawness of feeling, form and execution that had been largely absent from European art since the Middle Ages, but they also unleashed a palpable Dada swagger before Dada. As their dreams had not yet been trammeled by World War I, theirs was still a fairly cheerful barbarism, based on the belief that they could retrieve what was good and natural in the world if they just took off their clothes, danced around a bit and made art. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)20090618
 THE NEW MUSEUM: 'THE GENERATIONAL: YOUNGER THAN JESUS,' through July 5. The latest local survey to challenge the pre-eminence of the Whitney Biennial is big, international in scope and age-specific. As the title implies, only artists 33 or younger were considered for inclusion. The result is a serious, carefully considered show, but one that with a few magnetic entries aside -- a video by Cyprien Galliard; an animation by Wojciech Bakowski; a madcap Ryan Trecartin installation -- feels sedate for a youthfest. Despite the global reach, it's oddly familiar, like a more-substantial-than-average weekend gallery hop in Chelsea and the Lower East Side, right down to token African and Asian imports. Still, there are many intriguing artists to look (and listen) for, among them the filmmakers Keren Cytter and Luke Fowler; the digital whiz-kid Mark Essen; and Guthrie Lonergan. There is also, as it happens, a much livelier survey to be found in an accompanying book called ''Younger Than Jesus: Artist Directory,'' which features nearly 500 artists who didn't make the final exhibition cut. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090618
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'HARLEM, 1970-2009: PHOTOGRAPHS BY CAMILO JOSE VERGARA,' through July 12. From the time he arrived in the United States from Chile as a college student in 1965, the photographer Camilo Jose Vergara has been haunting, and haunted by, American cities. Some -- Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York -- he has revisited and rephotographed repeatedly in the past 40 years to record changes over time. The people and places of Harlem are the subject of this small show about alteration and continuation. A similar exhibition, ''Storefront Churches: Photographs by Camilo Jose Vergara,'' runs from June 20 to Nov. 29 at the National Building Museum in Washington. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street , (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)20090618
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through Oct. 24. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20090618
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'JONATHAN HOROWITZ: AND/ OR,' through Sept. 14. Andy Warhol's grandchildren, numerous beyond count, have cashed in on his rich and radical legacy to see what further possibilities it might yield. Such is the case with the New York artist Jonathan Horowitz in this smart, crisply edited retrospective. The works evoke the media-saturated art of the 1970s, the neo-Conceptualist consumer art of the 1980s and the identity art of the 1990s, landing in a Never-Neverland era, in which analog is poised to turn to digital, and Doris Day and Paris Hilton have equal currency. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)20090618
 STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'KALUP LINZY: IF IT DON'T FIT,' through June 28. Kalup Linzy's video work, in which the artist appears in drag and lends his overdubbed voice to almost all the characters, has a complex ancestry. A family tree would have to include the Wayans brothers, RuPaul, John Waters and Eddie Murphy on one branch, and the highbrow canon of dress-up artists, from Cindy Sherman to Yasumasa Morimura, on another. Mr. Linzy's first museum solo includes 22 videos made since 2002, with a total running time of about three hours. It includes his series ''Da Churen,'' his antic reimagining of the popular soap opera ''All My Children''; more recent episodes focus on the art world and feature Mr. Linzy's newest persona, Katonya the emerging artist. Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street , (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090618
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SADIE BENNING: PLAY PAUSE,' through Sept. 20. A new stop-action animation by this former film prodigy uses an avalanche of simple, almost naive gouache drawings, sometimes tinted with color, to prowl the margins of urban society. The result is low-key with undercurrents: a picture of the everyday sublime riddled with suggestions of longing, otherness and the difficulties of connection. Solveig Nelson has provided its beautifully accurate (yet largely electronic) soundtrack of city sounds, whether a subway singer or squirrels rifling through a garbage can, people talking in a bar or gates being called in an airport. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090618
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'CLAES OLDENBURG: EARLY SCULPTURE, DRAWINGS, AND HAPPENINGS FILMS' AND 'CLAES OLDENBURG AND COOSJE VAN BRUGGEN: THE MUSIC ROOM,' through Sept. 6. This pair of exhibitions lean heavily on the Whitney's sizable collection of Oldenburg and Oldenburg/ Van Bruggen drawings, some of which were shown in 2002. But they also include newly restored, never-exhibited films of Mr. Oldenburg's Happenings and a major kinetic sculpture, ''Ice Bag -- Scale C'' (1971), brought back to life by conservators. A centralized gallery of early drawings and soft sculptures defines Mr. Oldenburg's epicurean branch of Pop, with works like ''Giant BLT (Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich)'' and ''French Fries and Ketchup'' (both 1963), served up on low, platterlike pedestals. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)20090618
 Galleries: Uptown
 JOHN CHAMBERLAIN: 'EARLY YEARS,' through June 27. This show of works dating from 1960 to 1987 prompts a question: is there any sculpture from the 1960s that still looks as good as Mr. Chamberlain's? His assemblages of distressed autobody parts are almost classical. Hovering between the raw and the cooked, they are simultaneously compressed junk and elegant compositions of organic abstraction and orgasmic expression. L&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street , (212) 861-0020, lmgallery.com. (Johnson)20090618
 Galleries: Chelsea
 MARK FLOOD: 'CHELSEA WHORES,' through July 10. Works by this Houston-based artist mock American culture and the contemporary art world. A found Exxon sign has the words ''Take Drugs'' crudely stenciled across the bottom. Paintings on cardboard bear messages like ''Another Painting'' or ''2 More Paintings.'' Having it both ways, Mr. Flood also produces almost beautiful, traditional canvases by applying paint over old lace and then pulling away the fabric, leaving intricate, multi-hued, all-over patterns. Zach Feuer Gallery, 530 West 24th Street , (212) 989-7700, zachfeuer.com. (Johnson)20090618
 CHARLES RAY, through June 27. More than 20 years ago Mr. Ray created a piece of kinetic sculpture that became famous, even though hardly anyone saw it: ''Ink Line'' (1987), a fine stream of black ink flowing from a little hole in the ceiling to another in the floor. It is here publicly exhibited for the first time, along with two other pieces from the '80s: ''Moving Wire,'' in which the ends of a length of wire snake in and out of fine holes drilled into the wall, and ''Spinning Spot,'' a circular section of the floor, 24 inches in diameter, spinning at 33 r.p.m. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street , (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Johnson)20090618
 DIRK SKREBER, through June 27. The startling centerpiece of this exhibition is a pair of real cars, each wrapped around a vertical steel pole. The ''sculptures'' were produced at an automobile-safety testing operation, where big machines hurled the cars against the poles at speeds over 40 miles per hour. Also on display is a series of large, oddly blurry pictures of beautiful women. They suggest a fading connection to the eternal feminine, while the smashed cars evoke a Faustian industrialism. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 537 West 22nd Street , (212) 680-9467, petzel.com. (Johnson)20090618
 Galleries: SoHo
 RUBEN OCHOA: 'COLLAPSED,' through July 24. The Los Angeles artist Ruben Ochoa has taken his city as his theme, suggesting how its freeway systems reinforce its class divisions by carving up social space. For his first New York show, Mr. Ochoa presents the whole scheme in a state of spectacular collapse, in a single monumental sculpture that looks like an immense upended highway divider half-buried in dirt, with a surprise hidden underneath. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street , (212) 343-0441, peterblumgallery.com. (Cotter)20090618
 UNICA ZURN: 'DARK SPRING,' through July 23. A fiction writer and poet, Zurn (1916-1970) suffered a series of mental breakdowns during the last decade of her life, and it was during that time that she produced most of the playfully improvised, sometimes hallucinatory nightmarish drawings in this fascinating show. Wandering, loopy lines enfold intricate patterns of dots, petals and serpentine stripes punctuated by eyes, faces, birds, fish, snakes and flowers. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street , (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Johnson)20090618
 Galleries: Other
 GIOVANNI BATTISTA PIRANESI through June 30. A giant in the history of printmaking, Piranesi is best known for the ''Carceri,'' a series of etched and engraved architectural fantasies envisioning the mysterious, vaulted interiors of penal institutions. Four examples are included in this excellent show of about 55 prints from all phases of his career. David Tunick, 19 East 66th Street , (212) 570-0090, tunickart.com. (Johnson)20090618
 JOHN WOOD: 'ON THE EDGE OF CLEAR MEANING,' through July 18. Beginning in the 1950s, John Wood made unique objects with combinations of drawing, collage, printmaking and early forms of photography (cyanotype, photogram, cliche-verre). This retrospective at the Grey Art Gallery (with additional work at the International Center of Photography) explores his long career as an artist and a teacher at Alfred University. Organized by Mr. Wood's former student Nathan Lyons, it includes more than 210 photographs, artist's books and works that fall under the catch-all heading of mixed media, many of them as topical as they are technical. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village , (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Rosenberg)20090618
 Out of Town
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHEPARD FAIREY: SUPPLY AND DEMAND,' through Aug. 16. The surprise of the first museum retrospective for the creator of the Obama ''Hope'' poster is that almost everything he does, from abstracted images of Andre the Giant to his album covers for Led Zeppelin and other bands, is visually arresting. But in tracking his 20-year evolution from aesthetic anarchist to savvy, all-purpose designer and illustrator, the exhibition inadvertently casts doubt on his authenticity as a radical street artist. 100 Northern Avenue, Boston , (617) 478-3100, icaboston.org. (Johnson)20090618
 ZOE LEONARD, through Sept. 7. Always an exceptionally moving artist, though only sporadically visible, Zoe Leonard has an exhibition at Dia:Beacon, an hour and a half north of the city. It is different from some of her earlier shows: cooler and less intimate, documentary in form, broadly social in scope. At the same time, it shares a sensibility with what has come before, one attuned to realities of constant change, which as often as not means loss. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y. , (845) 440-0100, diaart.org. (Cotter)20090618
 NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN ART, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION: 'MAMI WATA: ARTS FOR WATER SPIRITS IN AFRICA AND ITS DIASPORAS,' through July 26. Mami Wata is Mother Water, Mother of Fish, goddess of oceans, rivers and pools, with sources in West and Central Africa and tributaries throughout the African Americas, from Bahia to Brooklyn. Usually shown as a half-woman, half-fish, she slips with ease between incompatible elements: water and air, tradition and modernity, this life and the next. Provider of riches, she is the natural bailout savior for our time, and this exhibition, organized by the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in Los Angeles, presents her in all her shape-shifting glory. The show's creator, Henry John Drewal, has compressed three decades of Mami watching into vivid visual form; the Washington curator, Christine Mullen Kreamer, has devised a fantastic subaqueous showcase for a powerhouse spiritual diva. 950 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington , (202) 633-4600, africa.si.edu. (Cotter)20090618
 Last Chance
 PHIL COLLINS: 'WHEN SLAVES LOVE EACH OTHER, IT'S NOT LOVE'; closes on Saturday. The main attraction in this video-making Conceptualist's show is a sophisticated parody of a Spanish television soap opera, made in Mexico City, using professional television actors. The 28-minute film tells a tangled tale of love, intrigue, betrayal and murder involving two maids, a gardener and the wealthy couple they work for. Though not as funny or imaginative as it should be, it is entertaining. Tanya Bonakdar, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea , (212)414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com. (Johnson)20090618
 YANG FUDONG: 'EAST OF QUE VILLAGE'; closes on Saturday. Running concurrently on six flat screens, each of six 20-minute videos shows shifting views of a remote village in a region surrounding Beijing. In the desolate landscape outside the village, scrawny dogs forage for food and get into snarling fights. In town, we see people doing routine activities. It might be an allegory of life on the fine line between civilization and savagery. Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street , (212) 977-7160, mariangoodman.com. (Johnson)20090618
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: 'DIRT ON DELIGHT: IMPULSES THAT FORM CLAY'; closes on Sunday. Ignoring the art-craft divide, this bold show examines ceramics in its own right. With George Ohr as Jackson Pollock, it ranges from postwar greats, like Peter Voulkos and Ken Price, to younger eminences, like Adrian Saxe and Arlene Shechet, to new arrivals, like Sterling Ruby, Jessica Jackson Hutchins and Jeffry Mitchell. The clash of approaches to beauty, technique, scale, color and finish is exuberantly edifying. It foments hope that the Minimal-Conceptual-Relational art religion (important as it is) could wither away, and curators of contemporary art could regain full use of their eyes and thus their brains. 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org. (Smith)20090618
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART OF THE KOREAN RENAISSANCE, 1400-1600'; closes on Sunday. The Korean gallery at the Met is a trim, tall, well-proportioned box of light. But it's just one room, and a smallish one at that, a reflection of the museum's modest holdings in art from this Asian country. So it's no surprise that the expansive-sounding show is a small thing too, with four dozen objects, most of them -- ceramic jars, lacquered boxes, scroll paintings -- compact enough to be stashed in a closet. But what it lacks in grandeur, it makes up for in fineness, and in rarity. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090618
 JONATHAN MONK: THE INFLATED DEFLATED; closes on Saturday. This artist's appropriation art (about art) can range from reverence to satire, but reverence -- usually reserved for Conceptual artists -- is better. Here satire prevails. Jeff Koon's famous stainless-steel ''Rabbit'' from 1986 is satirized in five stainless-steel ripostes that look more melted than deflated, as well as heavy and lifeless. Mr. Koon's rabbit is a truly weird work of art: taut, weightless, opaque yet full of light. Mr. Monk's seem like a lot of effort for what is basically a one-liner. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, Chelsea , (212) 645-7335, caseykaplangallery.com. (Smith)20090618
 ALICE NEEL: 'NUDES OF THE 1930S'; closes on Saturday. This beguiling show of early works on canvas and paper confirms that whether her subjects were clothed or not, Alice Neel tended toward portraits, accounting for face, body and psyche in equal measure. Sometimes the combination could be ineffably sweet, as in ''Florence Lesser,'' a pencil drawing of a Watteau-like beauty seen from the rear. But brutal honesty was more usual, as proved by the remarkable ''Rhoda Myers With Blue Hat,'' which takes its pose, chintz armchair and attitude from Cezanne's early portrait of the painter Achille Emperaire.

 ALICE NEEL: SELECTED WORKS; closes on Saturday. One of the great 20th-century portraitists, Neel wore her life on the sleeve of her painter's smock. Her portraits and self-portraits define her as a feminist before the fact, a left-leaning bohemian drawn to other nonconformists and a sybarite at ease with her body. The 16 paintings here -- all portraits -- confirm that she also excelled at exaggerating portraiture's inherent triangulations: of painter-sitter-viewer; figure-space-surface; line-brushwork-stain; biography-autobiography-history. The works from the 1940s and '50s in the opening gallery stunningly encapsulate these tensions. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea , (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Smith)20090618
 SIGMAR POLKE: 'LENS PAINTINGS'; closes on Friday. The artist's first show here in 11 years introduces the fruits of an improvised, if machine-executed, technique, by which Mr. Polke covers each of his canvases or fabrics with a thin sheet of combed plastic that hardens into a crude, lenticular surface. He applies images, daubs and pours of paint before and after. The visual confusion is initially intriguing, and the usual caustic beauty is achieved. The only problem is that so far the experiments mostly rehash familiar Polke motifs. These too need to broach new territory.

 LARA SCHNITGER; closes on Saturday. Fey, diaphanous new paintings show a softer side to this sharp-witted, fabric-loving Dutch-born artist, based in Los Angeles, who is best known for obstreperous sculptures about sexual desire and female consciousness. Now her patchworks are flat mixtures of collage, stencil, paint and printed fabric with splashes of bleach. They evoke high-style pornography or fashion illustration and are most fascinating for their seemingly simple, ultimately mysterious processes. The gallery is partitioned by screens of black nylon stockings stretched into a kind of Goth snowflake pattern through which everything looks good, at least momentarily.

 EVE SUSSMAN AND RUFUS CORPORATION: 'WHITE ON WHITE: THE PILOT (JUST LIKE BEING THERE)'; closes on Saturday. Ms. Sussman and her collaborators, who go by the name Rufus Corporation, have constructed an evocative think piece: a meticulously detailed re-creation of the office of the Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first human to go into space. They have simulated it so faithfully that it looks as if the real thing -- including chairs, a desk, telephones, memorabilia and fake daylight coming through sheer white curtains from a false window -- had been teleported to Chelsea.

HEADLINE: The Rationing of U.S. Medical Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 David Leonhardt (''Limits in a System That's Sick,'' Economic Scene, June 17) makes no mention of the most egregious form of medical care rationing -- the decisions by insurance companies to pay or not to pay for medical procedures, decisions that are routinely based on cost rather than on sound medical practice.
 Health care reform will get nowhere until the public understands that the insurance companies are the ones currently making the rationing decisions. The objection to a government-run plan -- that it would compromise the relationship of doctor and patient -- overlooks the fact that the relationship is already severely compromised by the insurance companies. 
 Howard Nenner Whately, Mass., June 17, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Let's not forget that health care is also already rationed by socioeconomic status: the very poor are covered by government plans, and the very rich can afford whatever treatment they want. It's we folks in the middle who are left holding the bag.
 Ted Claire Berkeley, Calif., June 17, 2009
 To the Editor:
 David Leonhardt is correct that health care in the United States is rationed. Our present system reflects a flawed value system of society that does not recognize the value of the time, judgment and advice of a fully trained primary-care physician. Payment is for actions taken. This is different from the other learned professions. 
 Thoughtful, conscientious evaluation and management require more time and fewer actions than third parties pay for. This changes good primary-care doctors into referral centers to specialists. Paying for time and not just actions is a prerequisite for meaningful reform.
 The cultural desire to know what is wrong immediately is another cause of higher costs. Immediacy requires myriad tests and imaging done quickly. Careful observation for a time can be just as effective, safer and less costly. Another prerequisite for lowering costs is for our national culture to develop some patience.

 The writer, a medical doctor, is a professor of pharmacology, medicine and public health at Weill Cornell Medical College. 
 To the Editor:
 ''Doctors and the Cost of Care'' (editorial, June 14) unfairly blames ''profligate physician behavior'' for high medical spending in the United States. Contrary to what the Dartmouth researchers claimed, regions with high Medicare per capita spending are not necessarily wasting money.
 Medicare spending per capita is an inaccurate proxy for overall medical spending. Atul Gawande, in his New Yorker article cited in the editorial, relies on the Dartmouth Medicare data to identify McAllen, Tex., as the town with the highest per capita medical spending next to Miami.
 But there are reasons other than physician behavior that explain Medicare costs in McAllen. It is a border town and cares for many newcomers who are uninsured and can't pay. Therefore costs are shifted to insurance programs like Medicare.
 In addition, to the extent actual medical spending per capita is high in McAllen, Dr. Gawande points out other reasons. McAllen's population drinks 60 percent more than average and has a 38 percent obesity rate. 
 Most doctors put their patients first, and many doctors provide free treatment when a patient cannot pay. What a shame doctors are being vilified in the name of reform. Betsy McCaughey New York, June 15, 2009
 The writer is chairwoman of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths and a former lieutenant governor of New York State.
 To the Editor:
 I was disturbed to see your editorial suggest that the blame for ''ever rising premiums'' falls primarily on physicians. Let's give credit where credit is due.
 Between 2000 and 2007, the 10 largest publicly traded insurance companies increased their profits 428 percent, from $2.4 billion to $12.9 billion, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
 During the same period, the number of insurers fell by nearly 20 percent, largely because of a huge wave of mergers that led to stunning consolidation. And premiums increased by more than 87 percent, rising four times faster than the average American's wages. 
 Today, 95 percent of American insurance markets qualify as tight oligopolies. As in so many industries, blind reliance on free-market forces has failed the American public. 
 Clearly, doctors bear a responsibility to curb costs. But the real culprits are the middlemen who, after years of lax regulation, now have such a tight grip on the market that they can -- and do -- charge whatever they want.

 To the Editor:
 Since its founding, Mayo Clinic has paid physicians with salaries to avoid financial conflicts of interest in clinical decision-making, and to promote multi-disciplinary coordination of care. Less well known, but important to Mayo's early growth, was its principle of billing based on patients' means.
 Using a sliding scale, wealthier patients paid more than poorer patients did for the same care. Such means adjustment increased patient volumes, which strengthened Mayo's expertise and efficiency, benefiting rich and poor alike. 
 Health reform warrants similar means-adjustment principles. Consumer-owned cooperatives could buy high-deductible, low-premium insurance policies, and pay below-deductible bills, using means-adjusted withdrawals from participants' health savings accounts. Such a plan would improve outcomes and value more effectively than bureaucratic price-setting would.

IN CITY, RARE DROP
 In Cost of Living
 New Yorkers may not have noticed their wallets bulging, but according to the federal Department of Labor, the cost of living in the New York metropolitan area declined in the last year. It may come as a surprise since prices in New York, on the whole, have not dropped for more than half a century.
 The biggest factor by far in the dip -- the Consumer Price Index for the region went down by 0.1 percent -- was the 25 percent drop in the price of gasoline and heating oil after the extraordinarily high levels they reached in the first half of 2008, according to data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 That drop more than offset increases in other expenses, like rent and food. Rent rose 5.3 percent, and the cost of food, at home or in restaurants, increased by 2.9 percent since last May, the bureau said.
 ''This may be a one-month anomaly, as gasoline prices are rising again,'' said Michael Dolfman, the regional commissioner of labor statistics.
 The last time the region had a year of deflation, in 1956, falling gas prices were also a factor, Mr. Dolfman said. But back then, he added, declining food prices and a drop in the cost of maintaining a car also contributed.
 On a month-to-month basis, prices are already rising. The city's Consumer Price Index was 0.2 percent higher in May than it had been in April, according to the bureau's figures. PATRICK McGEEHAN 
 TAKING
 QUESTIONS
 This week, John Cronin, director and chief executive officer of the Beacon Institute for Rivers and Estuaries and a senior fellow for environmental affairs at Pace University, left, is answering questions about General Electric's project to remove PCBs from the Hudson River. Here's an excerpt:
 Q. If we didn't dredge, how long would it take for the PCBs to naturally dissipate to acceptable levels? Peter North
 A. The best information is in the E.P.A.'s Feasibility Study and Proposed Plan. The evaluations in these studies focus mainly on threats to human health through the consumption of fish. The E.P.A. says that ''PCB target concentrations'' in fish, averaged over the entire upper Hudson, would reach 0.2 parts per million in 35 years with dredging, but that it would take ''greater than 67 years'' if there were no dredging -- it could be 75 or 100 or more.
 A concentration of 0.2 parts per million would allow one meal of fish per month, the E.P.A. says.
 Q. Where will the dredge material be disposed once it is removed from the river? Dan
 A. The dredged materials are destined for a 1,338-acre hazardous and radioactive waste processing and disposal site, owned and operated by Waste Control Specialists LLC, in Andrews County, Tex., near the New Mexico border. 
 According to G.E.'s description of the steps in the dredging and disposal process, ''After the sediments are dredged from the river bottom, they will be transported by barges to the project's sediment processing and transportation facility located on the Champlain Canal in the town of Fort Edward. There, water will be removed from the sediment and treated. The dried sediment will be loaded into gondola rail cars lined with protective plastic and transported about 2,200 miles to Texas.''

HEADLINE: Broadway Musicals Sing a Different Tune

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
A comparison of the original cast albums from this season's two most Tony-decorated new Broadway shows, ''Billy Elliot: The Musical'' and ''Next to Normal,'' with those of the most acclaimed revivals, ''West Side Story'' and ''Hair,'' reveals a glaring distinction between now and then.
 ''Billy Elliot'' has several show-stopping theatrical moments, but all of them have more to do with dance and musical staging than with songs. ''Next to Normal,'' the groundbreaking exploration of the failure of psychiatry to alleviate a troubled woman's anguish, has a sophisticated musical structure (it deserved its Tony award for best score) but no ready-made standards. 
 By contrast Leonard Bernstein's music for ''West Side Story'' is the most indestructible element of a show that in almost every other way feels dated. Although it yielded no immediate hits when it opened in 1957, many of its songs went on to become standards. ''Hair'' was the last show to yield four Top 10 hits; five if you count the Fifth Dimension's melding of ''Aquarius'' and ''Let the Sun Shine In'' into a pop anthem. A show that heralded the beginning of something -- the arrival of rock 'n' roll on Broadway -- marked the end of something else.
 Until recently the format of the traditional Broadway musical allowed for moments when the action paused long enough for a star to deliver a so-called 11 o'clock number, a song that audiences could hum or whistle as they left the theater. But when was the last time you actually heard that happen on the way out of a show with a new score? Nowadays the songs, the book and the musical staging are expected to flow together uninterruptedly.
 The Broadway musical is still struggling to shuck off its longstanding image as a quaint cultural outpost disconnected from the rest of popular culture. That image, however, is changing rapidly as the form's old masters and their audiences fade away. As Broadway, out of economic necessity, embraces rock, country and pop-soul music, it has increasingly turned into an elevated East Coast answer to Las Vegas, with Richard Rodgers and George Gershwin standing for tradition in New York, where the Rat Pack and Liberace epitomize Sin City. 
 The ascendance of the jukebox musical (like ''Mamma Mia!'' and ''Jersey Boys'') accelerated the narrowing of the longstanding gap between theater music and records. It is a sign of the times that Broadway is now a popular default setting for ''American Idol'' contestants. (Constantine Maroulis in ''Rock of Ages'' is the latest ''Idol''-minted marquee name.)
 Sound technology has evolved to the point that producers have discovered exactly how much volume an audience can take (the optimum sound is big but not deafening), and shows like ''Rock of Ages'' now offer a scaled-down version of the rock experience. Its sound design, like those of ''Mamma Mia!'' and ''Jersey Boys,'' is as critical to box office success as the familiarity of its recycled hits. The arrival next season of Julie Taymor's ''Spider-Man, Turn Off the Dark,'' with a score by the U2 rock gods Bono and the Edge promises to close the gap further.
 Here is a checklist of the original cast albums of the season's major Broadway shows and their place in the musical-theater continuum. 
 BILLY ELLIOT: THE MUSICAL Although the score by Elton John (music) and Lee Hall (lyrics) includes some of Mr. John's catchier theater tunes, like all his music for Broadway the songs are not as indelible as his early-70s hits. Since ''Billy Elliot'' is a dance musical, it makes sense that his score borrows vamps from ''A Chorus Line'' (the song ''Shine'') and Kander and Ebb. But the stronger numbers have the flavor of English barroom singalongs. Mr. Hall's lyrics always address the subject at hand, and Mr. John's music follows suit. A stomping protest march, ''Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher,'' which echoes the Kinks' ''Well-Respected Man,'' captures the embattled anger of striking miners stretched to the breaking point. 
 Here, and in ''Solidarity'' and ''Once We Were Kings,'' a stalwart militancy that has been a lurking presence in Mr. John's music from the beginning, marches confidently to the fore. ''Deep Into the Ground,'' a miner's lament, borrows from a strain of English folk music that goes back centuries. Mr. Hall's blunt lyrics are a refreshing change from the stilted poetic pretensions of Mr. John's longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin and keep the songs rooted in the real world. Even the anthem ''Electricity,'' in which Billy describes the liberating thrill of ballet, has an insistently stolid beat. 
 Released several years ago, the original cast album of ''Billy Elliot'' (Decca, $19.98) is the only recording of the show. It includes a bonus CD of Mr. John singing three songs, including ''Electricity,'' ''Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher'' and ''The Letter.'' 
 NEXT TO NORMAL (Ghostlight Records, $21.98). The songs in the show, composed by Tom Kitt with lyrics by Brian Yorkey, are intensely emotional, as befits the story of a woman suffering from bipolar disorder, although her delusions point more toward schizophrenia. So much information is packed into Mr. Yorkey's lyrics that repeated listening to the album deepens the experience and increases your respect for the clinically precise descriptions of complex psychological states and pharmacological side effects. 
 Mr. Kitt's medium soft-rock tunes aren't especially original. But they flow together into a fairly seamless, mostly through-composed narrative that is a huge improvement over the Andrew Lloyd Webber technique of layering continuous music over dialogue like wallpaper. 
 The husband-wife argument, ''You Don't Know/I Am the One,'' in which Alice Ripley playing the troubled central character, Diana Goodman, and her husband, Dan (J. Robert Spencer), try to explain themselves, brings confessional soft-rock into a psychiatric realm rarely visited in popular music. 
 My major quibble with ''Next to Normal'' is the importance given to Gabe (Aaron Tveit), a teenager who prances about the stage gloating, ''I'm Alive'' in his signature song. Dramatic as he is, this fantasy who resists being driven out of Diana's thoughts feels like an exaggerated contrivance in an otherwise realistic show. ''Next to Normal'' culminates with ''Light,'' an uplifting finale that feels tacked on to end it on a note of tentative hope. 
 That said, ''Next to Normal,'' which has refined rock-inflected chamber orchestration by Michael Starobin and Mr. Kitt, signals a future path for higher-minded Broadway shows. Its temerity to criticize the mystique of modern psychiatry and its clinical mumbo-jumbo is admirable.
 WEST SIDE STORY (Masterworks Broadway, $18.98). Who would disagree that Leonard Bernstein's semi-classical score raised the bar of Broadway composing to a level of complexity and emotional depth that has only been approached by Stephen Sondheim? 
 Melodies worthy of Puccini -- ''Maria,'' ''Tonight,'' ''Somewhere,'' ''One Hand, One Heart,'' ''I Have a Love'' -- mingle with bebop (''Cool,'' ''Jet Song,'' ''The Rumble'') and symphonically expansive mambo music (''America,'' ''Dance at the Gym''). Like last season's cast album of ''South Pacific,'' the new recording of ''West Side Story'' has the disadvantage of competing with an original cast album (and an inferior movie soundtrack) whose every inflection is graven in many people's minds.
 The translation of some lyrics into Spanish for the revival turns out to be a cosmetic gesture that adds only a gloss of authenticity without deepening the show. More than ever the lovers seem like stick figures. Matt Cavenaugh's Tony, a Ken doll with a gym body, has a sweet voice but, like the show's other battling street fighters, little physical dynamism. Larry Kert's original Tony had more verve. Josefina Scaglione's Maria more than matches Carol Lawrence's original, but the character is still a void. Karen Olivo's Anita lends the production and the cast album a desperately needed jolt of heat. In ''A Boy Like That/I Have a Love,'' her duet with Ms. Scaglione, the lyrics suddenly matter. The show now revolves around that number.
 HAIR (Ghostlight Records, $18.98). The cast album wisely doesn't try to update the quaintness of the original score by dressing it up in contemporary finery. ''Hair'' arrived on Broadway in 1968, just as the technology that created heavy metal was being refined, and its arrangements retain the clattery, mid-fidelity sound of the pre-metal era. The charm of its songs lies in the primitivism of these exclamatory fragments by childish urban street people whose personal vignettes are woven into a meandering tribal mosaic stirred to musical life by Galt MacDermot's sweetly upbeat tunes.
 The score's integrity owes to its homemade iconoclasm. The musical stands as an inspired one-of-a-kind achievement reflective of its moment, but I much prefer the Julie Taymor film ''Across the Universe,'' which majestically covered the same territory using Beatles songs that are far cleverer than the pie-in-the-sky ditties erupting from the members of ''Hair's'' shaggy tribe. Revisited today, its hippies look and sound more than ever like sad lost souls headed for defeat, their youth their only armor. ''I Got Life,'' the checklist of functioning body parts proudly announced by Claude (Gavin Creel), sums it up; they are the only things he has. 
 SHREK: THE MUSICAL (Decca, $18.98). The songs, with music by Jeanine Tesori and lyrics by David Lindsay-Abaire, translate the spirit of the film with sharper-edged wit and smarter musical jokes than anyone had a reason to expect. These wisecrack-loaded show tunes are true to the spirit of animated movie characters with brash personalities. Sutton Foster's Princess Fiona finds a delicious balance between cheeky and perky in her overcaffeinated awaiting-Prince Charming song, ''Morning Person.'' The score's humor reaches a screwball peak with ''I Think I Got You Beat,'' a competition between Fiona and Shrek (Brian d'Arcy James) to see who had the worst childhood, which culminates in dueling burps and bursts of flatulence. Equally clever is ''The Ballad of Farquaad,'' a mock-heroic spaghetti-western spoof. This is a rare score for a family musical that resists condescending to the audience. 
 9 TO 5 (Dolly Records, $14.99, available July 14). Dolly Parton's songs for the show based on the 1980 movie are stamped with her characteristic blend of spunk and perkiness but lack the homespun authenticity of her best mountain music. The score sounds better on the cast album than in the theater, where songs come across as stridently tinny musical sketches whipped up at the last minute for a mediocre variety show. The title song, composed around the time of the movie, has some charm, as does ''Backwoods Barbie.'' But even with acoustically balanced sound, the minimal tunes with singsong lyrics that sound like grown-up nursery rhymes reveal that writing for Broadway is not Ms. Parton's forte. 
 ROCK OF AGES (New Line Records, $18.98). If the '80s hits in the sardonic jukebox musical ''Rock of Ages'' are as unlikely candidates for today's pop charts as the golden oldies in the long-running 1995 revue ''Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' they are at least certified hits. The show illustrates how much rock changed between the late 1960s, when it was on the leading edge of culture, and the 1980s when it became a consumer commodity. 
 From the hilarious liner notes by the show's book writer, Chris D'Arienzo, to the slightly bent karaoke versions of anthems by hair bands like Poison, Whitesnake, Foreigner, Twisted Sister, Journey and Bon Jovi, ''Rock of Ages'' falls on itself with laughter. The show exalts the spirit of cut-up jock humor that trampled hippie idealism as rock's demigods morphed from counterculture heroes into preening macho caricatures. Among the catchy high-testosterone songs, some are better than others. (Foreigner's ''Waiting for a Girl Like You'' and ''I Want to Know What Love Is'' stand out.) 
 The thudding rock ballads are rendered just well enough for you to respect the house band, Arsenal, and the show's deliberately silly boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl (who briefly goes bad) story is as old as musical comedy itself. 
 Along with ''Jersey Boys,'' ''Rock of Ages'' belongs to an emerging phenomenon that I would call ''the guy musical,'' a style that has just begun to make Broadway a safe place for insecure young men to have fun without fear of being labeled gay. Musical-theater snobs may turn up their noses at this inevitable onslaught, but producers, scenting the future, can smell money.

HEADLINE: Despite India's Health, Airline Fights to Survive

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS and VIKAS BAJAJ

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
Kingfisher Airlines of India promised passengers the royal treatment -- flight attendants so comely they were called ''flying models,'' full meals even on short flights and curbside valets to carry their bags.
 But how the mighty have fallen. 
 Short of cash and unable to pay its bills, the company has had to take on debt from India's government-owned banks, pledge assets in exchange for loan guarantees, postpone delivery of new planes and search for a foreign investor. 
 Most symbolic, perhaps, instead of starting nonstop flights from India to California -- as envisioned by the company's flamboyant founder, Vijay Mallya -- the airline last added a route from Calcutta to Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh.
 Airlines around the world are suffering as businesses and individuals cut back on travel, but in India, by some measures, they are suffering more. And analysts say that in the months to come, Kingfisher, one of India's top domestic carriers and one of the country's most recognized brands, may be in for more pain than any other airline here. 
 Kingfisher's troubles present a cautionary tale for investors and suppliers eager to do business in one of the few major economies still experiencing significant growth. Even as incomes and consumption continue to rise in India, success is not guaranteed -- nor is a smooth ride.
 Of the $9 billion that the International Air Transport Association estimates the global airline industry will lose in 2009, nearly a quarter will be lost by Indian airlines, which fly just 2 percent of the world's passengers. 
 For India's private airlines, ''the next six to nine months are about survival,'' said Kapil Arora, a partner with Ernst & Young's aviation practice. To make it, they will have to cut costs relentlessly in marketing, technology and payroll, he said. 
 Even that may not be enough. After resisting for years, the Indian government is considering letting foreign airlines take a 25 percent stake in Indian carriers. But the rest of the world's airlines are short of cash as well. ''It's going to take active government involvement'' to keep India's airlines in business, Mr. Arora said.
 For Mr. Mallya, whose empire also includes United Spirits and United Breweries, India's largest liquor and beer producers (the name Kingfisher came from his beer brand), as well as a fertilizer company and an engineering firm, cutting costs could be difficult. 
 Known as the ''King of Good Times,'' Mr. Mallya pursues a lavish lifestyle that includes a collection of hundreds of sports cars and a villa on the French Riviera. He built Kingfisher as a ''premium'' airline and, when passenger numbers were growing, placed big orders for planes, including five of the A380 superjumbo jets from Airbus, even though Kingfisher had never turned a profit. 
 In an e-mail interview, Mr. Mallya brushed off suggestions that the company was struggling for survival. It will turn a profit in the next fiscal year, he said, and a $500 million loan, recently arranged by the State Bank of India and sold to an alliance of banks, is sufficient to keep the company going this year. 
 He was also confident about finding a foreign investor willing to take a stake in the airline. ''We are in discussion with private equity investors,'' he said. ''Certain airlines have shown keen interest as well, subject to the government policy allowing them to invest.''
 Bankers and analysts say that Mr. Mallya's target price for any deal is as high as eight times Kingfisher's stock price, which has fallen more than 80 percent from its peak in late 2007. He would not confirm that figure, but said, ''There is handsome value for the largest carrier with the widest network in a country with great potential such as India.''
 Still, such a premium could be difficult to come by even in good times. 
 Kingfisher lost 10.5 billion rupees, or $219 million, in the nine months that ended in December, the most recent figures available. India's other large private airline, Jet Airways, reported a slight profit for the first quarter of this year, in part because of one-time tax credits. Kingfisher still owes $100 million to oil companies for jet fuel it bought in 2008, Mr. Mallya said. Those payments will be made by November.
 Miranda Mills, vice president at Airbus, said the manufacturer had been in regular conversation with its Indian customers and was not worried about any of Kingfisher's orders, including those for the A380. She added that Airbus was discussing the look of the cabins with Kingfisher and interior designers. ''Vijay is very clear'' that he wants to bring the A380 to India, she said. 
 ''We work a long-term game,'' Ms. Mills said. In the airline business, companies do not place an ''order for the next year or two and then change your business model totally,'' she said. 
 Unfortunately, that is just what the Indian government is encouraging airlines to do. ''Individual customers have been thoroughly pampered all these years,'' Praful Patel, the Indian civil aviation minister, said. Airlines need to redefine their business model, he said, and emulate no-frills carriers that are close to breaking even, like IndiGo and SpiceJet. 
 Indian airlines grew too much, too quickly during the recent boom, analysts say. At its zenith, the industry was adding six planes a month, when there was demand for only half that number, according to the New Delhi office of the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation, a consulting and research firm. To gain market share and attract customers who may never have flown before, airlines were pricing tickets way below cost. 
 Adding to their problems, Jet and Kingfisher made expensive acquisitions in 2007 -- Jet Airways bought Air Sahara and Kingfisher Airlines bought Air Deccan. Analysts say that the airlines paid too much for the acquisitions and have taken too long to absorb the operations they acquired. 
 Next, surging fuel prices forced up ticket prices just as the global slowdown cut business and leisure travel. To make things worse, Indian airlines face much higher fixed costs than carriers in many other countries, like fuel taxes that can be five times the global average. 
 In India, ''the big boys today have huge debts, massive fleets, are confronted with a marked slowdown in domestic and on the international side,'' said Kapil Kaul, chief executive for the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation in India. And, he said, ''there are virtually no funds available.''
 Saroj K. Datta, executive director of Jet Airways, said the industry is suffering in large part because it has not reduced capacity enough. His company has cut capacity 20 percent since last year, he said, but the industry's overall capacity is down only 2 percent to 3 percent, while demand for air travel is down about 11 percent. 
 ''That has resulted in most airlines offering lower and lower prices in the hopes of filling up seats,'' he said. But with prices this low, no airline has been able to break even.
 Loans from banks that are majority owned by the Indian government have given the big airlines some breathing room, but that money is unlikely to be enough to get them through the downturn.
 While Mr. Patel, the civil aviation minister, would not comment on individual airlines, he did say that the government would not block further consolidation or prevent a carrier from closing. Many airlines should have been better prepared, he added. ''Some of these guys in the best days didn't go big time to the markets and raise money,'' he said. 
 Characteristically, Mr. Mallya is undeterred. Kingfisher Airlines ''enjoys business from both'' low-fare and premium passengers, he said, ''which is one of the reasons why Kingfisher Airlines flew more than a million passengers in May 2009.''

HEADLINE: Border Patrol Arrests of Illegal Immigrants Drop

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
Arrests of illegal immigrants by the Border Patrol declined in 2008 to 724,000, the lowest number in 35 years, the Department of Homeland Security reported. Apprehensions by the agency fell from a peak of 1.6 million in 2000, declining by 39 percent in the last three years. Border Patrol arrests are regarded by researchers as a broad-brush indicator of the flow of illegal immigrants. The department's report attributed the decline to high unemployment in the United States and increased border enforcement, among other factors.

HEADLINE: City's Unemployment Rate Climbs to 9%; 361,000 Are Jobless, Highest Since 1993

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New Yorkers are still losing jobs at a fast pace as the city's economy continues to trail the nation through the recession.
 The city's unemployment rate jumped to 9 percent in May, its highest level in more than a decade, according to data released on Thursday by the state's Labor Department. The figures showed that there were about 361,000 unemployed people in the city, more than at any time during the recession that surrounded the Sept. 11 terrorist attack and the largest number of city residents out of work since 1993.
 In the private work force, the weakness in May was concentrated in the fields of communications media, advertising and other information services, as well as in finance and education, according to James Brown, an analyst with the state's Labor Department. 
 Those losses offset employment gains in tourism-related businesses and construction, Mr. Brown said. He said that aggressive price-cutting by hotels had kept tourists visiting and saved jobs. Construction benefited from the flow of federal stimulus funds, he added.
 The latest numbers, Mr. Brown said, illustrate that New York's economy is still contracting, despite recent fluctuations in the city's unemployment rate, which was 8 percent in April.
 ''Although the unemployment rate actually dipped slightly in three of the last five months, the trend is still strongly upward,'' he said. ''Despite some positive notes, the city's job market is still weak and the weakest areas -- financial activities and professional and business services -- will not resume growth until after the national economy improves.''
 The city's unemployment rate is still lower than the national rate, which rose to 9.4 percent in May, from 8.9 percent in April. But Mr. Brown's data show that the job market is uneven across the five boroughs, with the unemployment rate ranging from a low of 7.4 percent on Staten Island to a high of 10.8 percent in the Bronx.
 In the city, public employment, which is usually more stable than at private companies, suffered a lot in May, said Barbara Byrne Denham, a private economist who tracks the city's job market. According to her calculations, which she adjusts for seasonal trends in hiring and layoffs, the city lost 8,500 jobs in May, nearly two-thirds of them public jobs. Much of that decline may be the result of attrition and cutbacks in normal springtime hiring by government agencies, she said. 
 But the significant gains in jobs in accounting, construction and leisure and hospitality hinted that the outlook for workers in the city might be brightening, said Ms. Denham, chief economist for Eastern Consolidated, a real estate investment services firm in Manhattan.
 ''These gains suggest that the city's economic outlook may not be as dire as it had looked as recently as three months ago,'' she said, adding that some weak sectors, like securities brokerage and real estate, appear to be shedding jobs at a slower pace than had been forecast.
 A separate report released on Thursday by the federal Department of Labor showed that the number of New York State residents making first-time claims for jobless benefits rose by 4,795 in the first week of June, the fifth-biggest increase in the nation.
 Statewide, the unemployment rate rose to 8.2 percent from 7.7 percent in April, the department reported. The state's unemployment rate is at its highest level in more than 16 years, and the number of unemployed residents of the state, which rose by 51,000 in May to 802,400, is the highest it has been since July 1976.
 The city's unemployment rate last reached 9 percent in October 1997. But back then, the number of unemployed people in the city was lower, at 318,000, because the city's labor force was smaller, the data show. The last time there were more city residents out of work was in the early 1990s, when the unemployment tally peaked around 385,000.
 In Albany, Gov. David A. Paterson used the numbers as a whip to try to herd squabbling state senators back into chambers to complete the legislative session.
 ''Today's unemployment report from the Department of Labor is further proof that these are serious times in New York State that require the full attention of every elected member of the Legislature,'' the governor said in a statement. ''If senators do not wish to go to work, there are more than 800,000 New Yorkers ready to take their jobs -- and salary -- today.''

HEADLINE: In New York, Sotomayor Put Focus On the Poor

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE and MICHAEL POWELL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Time and again, Sonia Sotomayor challenged her fellow board members at the State of New York Mortgage Agency, asking pointed questions about its work: What of the poor? As we help build new neighborhoods upon the rubble of the old, are we abandoning those with the lowest incomes? 
 Ms. Sotomayor, the United States Supreme Court nominee, sat on the board from 1987 to 1992. During that time, the agency insured hundreds of millions of dollars in mortgages, leading to the construction of thousands of apartments for moderate-income New York residents. But often, these projects seemed to leave her uneasy.
''Ms. Sotomayor voiced her continuing objection to the rehabilitation of projects in low-income areas without providing for a higher component of low-income families,'' according to agency minutes from March 1990. ''She repeated her request for an analysis of the various economic groups in the neighborhood affected by the project.''
 She ended up voting for most of those projects. But in voicing her concerns, Ms. Sotomayor offered a window into her tough and skeptical style, and into her consistent focus on the poorest of the poor, hundreds of pages of agency records show. 
 The nonprofit Community Preservation Corporation built the project, in Harlem, that she challenged in March 1990. The corporation's president, Michael Lappin, said that he could not have obtained financing without the mortgage agency's help, and that nearby projects served lower-income residents.
 ''It was important to the neighborhoods that you have a balance and not re-ghettoize,'' Mr. Lappin said. ''There was a thoughtful, planned-out strategy for how to rebuild these neighborhoods.'' 
 Similar debates unfolded as New York City officials, beginning in 1987, committed $5.1 billion to rebuild large swaths of the city, in neighborhoods crippled by arson and abandonment. 
 Twenty-two years later, officials can point to 309,846 apartments built, rehabilitated or preserved for low- and moderate-income residents -- one of the greatest urban rebuilding feats in the nation's history. The governor at the time, Mario M. Cuomo, appointed Ms. Sotomayor to the mortgage agency's board just as the rebuilding program took wing.
 One of the agency's mandates was to provide mortgage insurance to nonprofit developers of large residential buildings. These were complicated deals, constructed of a patchwork of city and state subsidies, and the terms required developers to set aside some apartments with rents affordable to moderate-income tenants.
 Minutes show that Ms. Sotomayor often worried about the impact of such development on nearby lower-income residents. In October 1988, for example, she spoke out when the agency considered helping a project that would rehabilitate housing in a section of Harlem.
 ''Ms. Sotomayor expressed her concern over the gentrification of cultural neighborhoods that have existed for many years,'' agency minutes show. ''She felt that economic development is displacing cultural groups who formed the original neighborhood; she pointed to the East 105th Street project as an example.''
 In March 1989, she raised similar concerns about a project in the South Bronx. It was to include apartments for families making $17,000 to $23,000, but ''she reiterated her view that the project under consideration was not adequately addressing the needs of low-income people.''
 In July 1990, Ms. Sotomayor flagged a $10.7 million project to rehabilitate six apartment buildings in the Bronx, an effort backed by the city, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and local nonprofit groups. The buildings, a mortgage agency staff member explained, would house residents making $21,000 to $29,000. But Ms. Sotomayor objected, saying that 89 percent of those in the surrounding neighborhoods earned less than that. And she suggested inviting critics to testify about their concerns.
 ''She wanted lower-income people served, and that's a good goal,'' said Royce Mulholland, who represented the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal on the board. ''But we also explained that the insurance program was intended to serve moderate- and middle-income apartments -- and we only provided the insurance, which means we had very little leverage.''
 Ms. Sotomayor did not confine her scrutiny to the balance between low- and middle-income housing.
 After receiving a report about the agency's affirmative action program in 1989, she requested a breakdown of the number of black and Hispanic workers. Later that year, when she was informed that just 8 percent of the agency's contracts went to businesses owned by women or members of minorities, she called its performance ''abysmal.''
 ''It was like a boys' club when we came there,'' recalled Hazel Dukes, who is black and joined the board about the same time as Ms. Sotomayor. ''We knew how to be pushy. We were like bees in their bonnet.''
 Fioravante G. Perrotta, a former agency board member, did not care for Ms. Sotomayor's views. Mr. Perrotta recalls her as conscientious and knowledgeable, but he said she was an ''extreme partisan'' on questions of class and ethnicity. 
 ''She made it very clear that she was very liberal and a Democrat,'' Mr. Perrotta said, ''and that really should have been a nonpolitical organization.''
 Mr. Mulholland recalled her in more complimentary terms. ''She didn't have a housing background,'' he said, ''but she was a real strong woman with a real strong voice.''
 A former state housing commissioner, Angelo Aponte, a Democrat and board member, sometimes dueled with Ms. Sotomayor over the merits of providing housing for middle-class families, minutes show. But Mr. Aponte emphasized in an interview that Ms. Sotomayor was no radical, and usually ended up voting for the projects.
 ''She was the conscience of the board,'' Mr. Aponte said. ''She kept reminding the board and developers that when you do development -- and she wasn't against development -- you have to keep in mind where you are building and whether people can afford to live there and not be shoved out of where they've been living for many years.''
 When Ms. Sotomayor left to become a federal judge in 1992, her colleagues noted that mind-set in a resolution honoring her. ''True to her convictions, Ms. Sotomayor consistently defended the rights and needs of the disadvantaged'' and warned against ''the negative effects of gentrification,'' it said.
 Still, William C. Mattison Jr., the chairman of the board when it passed the resolution, said her performance as a board member two decades ago could reveal only so much about her approach if she became a Supreme Court justice. ''People are going to try to find a way to say that as a good judge, she should not have been raising the questions of the type she did as a board member,'' Mr. Mattison said. 
 But, he added, ''as a judge, she knows what the law is and you can't go beyond the law.''

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths WAGNER, MARTIN

 BODY:
WAGNER--Martin, labor arbitrator, university leader and influential scholar died on Tuesday in his home. He was 97 and lived in Urbana, Illinois. Professor Wagner served as director of the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations (now the School of Labor and Employment Relations) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, from 1958 to 1968. He continued as a professor until 1982, when he retired and was awarded emeritus status. 
Wagner played a central role in the development of public sector labor relations laws for the state of Illinois, including five years of service as chairman of the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board and leadership on numerous state and regional federal commissions and boards on training, labor-management relations, unemployment, wage-price controls, civil service, and related matters. Early in his career, Wagner served in the WWII Office of Production Management and as a regional director for the National Labor Relations Board in San Francisco and Cincinnati. In 1948, he served as the founding executive director of the Louisville Labor-Management Committee, the nation's first area labor-management committee. In that same year, he was a founding member of the Industrial Relations Research Association (now the Labor and Employment Relations Association), which recently honored Wagner with its lifetime achievement award. He was also recognized recently for 50 years of service in the National Academy of Arbitrators (NAA), a rare accomplishment as individuals are only inducted into the NAA after they have already achieved prominence in the profession. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) provided Wagner with a Lifetime Membership Award in 1996, a particularly significant accomplishment for a labor neutral. At the School of Labor and Employment Relations at the University of Illinois, Wagner launched one of the early doctoral programs in industrial relations in 1966. He was beloved by former students and colleagues alike and is seen as having provided the core "dna" for what is one of the nation's top programs in labor and employment relations. Born on September 11, 1911, in Newport Kentucky, Wagner earned A.B. and M.A. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1933 and 1935 respectively. He was a Rhodes Scholar, (Magdalen '36) earning a B.A. from Oxford University in 1937 and later an M.A. from Oxford in 1960. At the 100th anniversary celebration of the Rhodes Scholar program in 2003, Martin Wagner was the third oldest recipient in attendance. Wagner is survived by his son John, of Orlando, FL, his daughter Martha Wagner Weinberg, of Brookline, MA, and two grandchildren, David and Katy Weinberg. His wife Nelle Nordstrom Wagner preceded him in death in 1997. A commemorative celebration of Martin Wagner's life and accomplishments is on Saturday morning, September 12th in the Martin Wagner Education Center at the School of Labor and Employment Relations, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, with a memorial service to follow on that weekend.

HEADLINE: Mercedes Campaign Focuses on Image, Not Recession

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
CAR companies like Hyundai and Ford have been showing solidarity with consumers recently, running ads promising that the companies will help them should they lose their jobs. 
 Mercedes-Benz USA is trying a different way to get customers to buy cars as it introduces its updated E-Class Series. The ad campaign for the midsize car, available as a sedan or a coupe, is the company's biggest in two years, estimated at $75 million. It does not talk about great value or good deals. Instead, it focuses on the cars' technology and heritage, a somewhat standard approach for the brand. 
 ''Everyone has that trigger that's going to get them out there in the marketplace again, assuming that they have the means and they're just choosing not to spend it,'' said Alex Gellert, the chief executive of Merkley & Partners, part of the Omnicom Group, which created the Mercedes print and television ads. 
 The E-Class update is meant to turn around an alarming sales slide for Mercedes, which is owned by Daimler. Its United States sales have declined 28.7 percent this year from the same time in 2008, according to the company. May sales were even further off, falling 33.4 percent from May 2008. The United States turned in the worst showing of any geographic region in May.
 Even given the sales challenge, Steve Cannon, the vice president of marketing for Mercedes-Benz USA, decided not to echo the recession-conscious marketing that other car manufacturers have used. Hyundai promised to help customers pay for their cars if they lost their jobs, an offer Ford and General Motors soon matched. A recent spate of ads for Honda's Insight described it as ''designed and priced for us all.'' 
 ''I'd rather tell our brand story, our innovation story, our value story, than join the chorus of everyone else that's screaming 'sale' -- that's about the only message that's out there right now,'' Mr. Cannon said. ''Customers have told us, 'we know there are deals out there,' so just getting on television with an expensive media plan and shouting, 'there's a sale,' they already know that.''
 The television spots will begin running on Monday. One starts with scenes of families admiring classic Mercedes cars and trucks at the Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart, Germany. These are interspersed with scenes of a coupe driving along a forested road. At the end, the car bursts through the museum's glass wall and spins into place alongside the other Mercedes cars. ''Taking its rightful place in a long line of amazing performance machines,'' the narrator says.
 A television commercial for the sedan highlights new technology in the cars, like ''attention assist,'' which helps alert sleepy drivers, and an automatic braking system that kicks in when a driver loses concentration and is about to hit something. The narrator promotes the E-Class as ''the future of the automobile.'' 
 Although Mercedes wanted to avoid emphasizing sale prices, it did place the starting price for the cars at the end of each television spot and in the print ads. At $48,600, it is almost 9 percent less than the starting price for the last set of E-Class cars, from the 2003 model year. The ads give just the price, though, not the discount. ''For Mercedes-Benz customers, $48,600 is a huge value story, and those people know it, so I don't have to go out and say, 'value, value' -- that's not appropriate for our brand,'' Mr. Cannon said. ''The folks that are looking for a midsize luxury sedan kind of understand the price points.''
 The television ads will run in two phases: the one that starts Monday will run through July. The ads will resume in September, with the television networks' season premieres. The ads will run on networks like Bravo and CNN and during news programs. Print ads will soon run in magazines like Architectural Digest, Golf Digest and Tennis. The online advertising, designed by Razorfish, a unit of Microsoft, includes home page advertisements on sites like Bloomberg.com and CNBC.com.
 For his customers, ''I think there's a level of crisis fatigue and recession fatigue out there, marketing down to, 'we feel your pain. We're all in this together,' versus, 'this is who we are,' '' Mr. Cannon said. ''All the things that mattered to them before the recession, it still matters to them. But we have to work harder to break through, because the system has been shocked significantly.''

HEADLINE: A Move to Put the Union Label on Solar Power Plants

BYLINE: By TODD WOODY

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO 

 BODY:
When a company called Ausra filed plans for a big solar power plant in California, it was deluged with demands from a union group that it study the effect on creatures like the short-nosed kangaroo rat and the ferruginous hawk.
 By contrast, when a competitor, BrightSource Energy, filed plans for an even bigger solar plant that would affect the imperiled desert tortoise, the same union group, California Unions for Reliable Energy, raised no complaint. Instead, it urged regulators to approve the project as quickly as possible.
 One big difference between the projects? Ausra had rejected demands that it use only union workers to build its solar farm, while BrightSource pledged to hire labor-friendly contractors.
 As California moves to license dozens of huge solar power plants to meet the state's renewable energy goals, some developers contend they are being pressured to sign agreements pledging to use union labor. If they refuse, they say, they can count on the union group to demand costly environmental studies and deliver hostile testimony at public hearings. 
 If they commit at the outset to use union labor, they say, the environmental objections never materialize.
 ''This does stress the limits of credibility to some extent,'' the California energy commissioner, Jeffrey Byron, said at one contentious hearing, ''when an attorney representing a labor union is so focused on the potential impact of a solar power plant on birds.''
 Union leaders acknowledge that they make aggressive use of the environmental laws, but say they do it out of genuine concern for the sustainability of California's power industry, not just as a negotiating tactic. And they contend they do not abandon valid environmental objections to a project just because a company signs a labor agreement.
 ''We've been tarred and feathered more than once on this issue,'' said Marc Joseph, a lawyer for California Unions for Reliable Energy. ''We don't walk away from environmental issues.''
 At proposed fossil-fuel power plants, the union group has long been accused of exploiting environmental laws to force companies into signing labor agreements. The tactic is a subject of perennial discussion in the California legislature, which has considered, but never passed, bills to strip labor of its right to participate in environmental assessments. 
 What is new is that California Unions for Reliable Energy, a coalition of construction unions, appears to be applying this approach to new-age renewable energy projects, especially solar power plants, which are being fast-tracked to help meet the state's green power target. 
 Lawyers for the union both negotiate labor agreements with solar developers and participate in the environmental review of the projects. 
 California Unions for Reliable Energy insists it is pursuing the long-term interests of its members. If energy projects are held to high environmental standards, the group says, more of them will ultimately get built, and that will mean more union jobs.
 Nationwide, as billions of dollars in public and private investment flow to renewable energy projects, the environmental and labor battles being fought in California could prove to be the opening skirmishes of a larger fight over the emerging green economy.
 Should Rust Belt factories converted to making solar components and wind turbines be union shops, gateways to the middle-class for a new generation of workers in the green economy? Or will the green economy look more like the service economy, with low-paid employees installing rooftop solar panels and retrofitting buildings?
 For the labor movement, green jobs represent an opportunity to regain relevance after years of declining membership.
 ''Unions are trying to get a foothold in solar, wind and other new green occupations,'' said Philip Mattera, research director for Good Jobs First, a labor-oriented research group in Washington.
 ''We're at a turning point that will have an impact on the future of the whole economy, and a lot of unions are gearing up.''
 But skeptics fear that union control of renewable energy projects will saddle the nascent industry with high costs and undermine its competitiveness. 
 ''These environmental challenges are the unions' major tactic to maintain their share of industrial construction -- we call it greenmail,'' said Kevin Dayton, state government affairs director for the Associated Builders and Contractors of California. ''The future of solar energy is jeopardized by these unions holding up construction.''
 In California, project labor agreements can raise costs on a project by about 20 percent, Mr. Dayton estimated.
 The fights of the moment center on solar farms proposed for tens of thousands of acres of desert and agricultural land.
 When the utility giant the FPL Group ignored entreaties from California Unions for Reliable Energy to use union labor on a planned 250-megawatt solar farm, it was hit with 144 data requests, demanding details on things like ''the engine brand, model, and horsepower rating'' of a water pump engine, ''the number of man-hours devoted to focused tortoise surveys, by location'' and ''the role of each individual that participated.''
 In filings with the California Energy Commission, Ausra has accused the union group of abusing environmental laws in a bid to extract a labor agreement. FPL's lawyers accused the group of trying to stall the company's solar project.
 Bob Balgenorth, chairman of the labor group, makes no apologies for pushing hard for union jobs from solar developers while scrutinizing the environmental impact of the projects. ''You only have so much land that can accept solar power plants,'' said Mr. Balgenorth, who has cultivated strong ties with conservation groups. 
 ''So the question is, should that land be used for low-paid jobs or should that land be used for high-paid jobs?''
 Some solar developers say that signing a labor agreement is simply an unavoidable cost of doing business. 
 ''Let's just say that it is clear to us from experience that if we do not enter into a project labor agreement, the costs and schedule of the project is interminable,'' said Douglas Wert, chief executive of Spinnaker Energy, a San Diego company hired to build two solar farms for Portuguese developer Martifer.
 After Stirling Energy Systems filed plans with California regulators to install 30,000 solar dishes on 10 square miles of desert land, its executives got a call from Mr. Joseph, the union lawyer. Sean Gallagher, a vice president for Tessera Solar, the development arm for Stirling, said the company declined Mr. Joseph's request to commit to using union labor.
 California Unions for Reliable Energy subsequently filed 143 data requests with the company on the final day such requests could be made, and later intervened in a second, 850-megawatt Stirling solar project.
 It was a different story after BrightSource Energy pledged to hire union-friendly contractors to build its Mojave Desert solar power plant complex. Despite questions raised by environmental groups about the project's impact on wildlife, the union group took no action, according to commission documents.
 Mr. Joseph said that the labor group wants to mediate between environmentalists and BrightSource, which is based in Oakland, Calif. 
 ''We're actually hoping that we can help resolve these issues in a way that allows that project to go forward and gives maximum protection to the desert tortoise,'' he said. 
 He said he sees ''absolutely no conflict of interest'' in seeking labor agreements from solar developers while challenging theenvironmental effect of the projects. ''It is in the interest of construction workers to have good middle class jobs -- and to have conventional and renewable power plants that are sustainable,'' Mr. Joseph said.
 The union group's strategy drew plaudits from environmentalists when the group was winning agreements from developers to cut pollution from fossil fuel power plants. But as some conservation groups ally themselves with business interests to push for a rapid rollout of renewable energy, strains are showing in the so-called blue-green alliance.
 Some environmental groups are worried that the labor tactics will delay green energy projects and cause a backlash, but they are reluctant to go public with criticisms of the labor movement.
 Others, like the Natural Resources Defense Council, are trying to steer clear of the controversy. 
 The council ''hasn't taken a position on whether union labor should or shouldn't be used in these projects,'' said Sheryl Carter, the group's co-director of energy programs.
 And still others defend the labor group's role.
 Carl Zichella, the Sierra Club's director of western renewable programs, said California Unions for Reliable Energy had been effective at extracting concessions that aid the environment.
 ''It's not a warm fuzzy thing they are doing; it's a very self-interested thing they're doing,'' he said. ''But it has a large ancillary public benefit.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about union efforts to gain a foothold in green energy projects misstated the title of Jeffrey Byron, who questioned union motives in objecting to some projects on environmental grounds. He is one of five members of the California Energy Commission; he is not ''the California energy commissioner.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Study New Ideas to Cut Health Plan Cost

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The high cost of securing health insurance for all Americans, the top domestic priority of President Obama, has Congressional Democrats scrambling to scale back their proposals or find ways to trim tens of billions of dollars a year from existing health programs.
 According to slides presented at a closed-door meeting this week, members of the Senate Finance Committee are debating several new ideas, including ''an automatic mechanism'' to reduce the growth of Medicare under an expedited procedure like the one used to close military bases. 
 The documents displayed in the slides show that the committee is also considering a proposal that would require some employers to contribute to the cost of Medicaid or private health insurance for low-wage workers. One purpose is to discourage employers from foisting the cost of employee health benefits onto the federal government, a maneuver that would push up the cost of revamping the health system.
 Mr. Obama suggested earlier this week that the total cost to overhaul the health care system would be ''on the order of $1 trillion over the next 10 years.'' But initial estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, the official scorekeeper on the cost of legislation, have come in much higher, leaving many lawmakers with sticker shock and casting about for alternatives. 
 As the Senate health committee continued drafting a companion bill on Thursday, one of its Democratic members, Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland, said, ''Obviously this is not going to go as fast as we thought.''
 The Finance Committee has wrestled all week with the three biggest issues in the health care legislation: how to pay for coverage of the uninsured, whether to create a new public insurance plan and whether to impose new obligations on employers. 
 But it is the cost of the legislation that seems to bedevil lawmakers the most. A budget office estimate of $1.6 trillion as the cost of an earlier Finance Committee draft sent members hunting for ways to pare the expense. Peppered with questions about the legislation, the committee's chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, has postponed a drafting session that was to have begun early next week. 
 Still, Mr. Baucus was upbeat on Thursday. ''We are getting closer and closer and closer,'' he said after a two-hour meeting of a half-dozen senators -- three Democrats and three Republicans. ''There's no doubt in my mind that we will have a bipartisan bill.'' 
 Other Democrats said the cost estimate and the resulting delays were a temporary setback, not a deal-killer. 
 Indeed, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said they were evidence of a vibrant democratic process.
 ''The give and take, the back and forth of different ideas -- you may call them snags, we call them the legislative process,'' Ms. Pelosi said. ''This is a situation where everybody wants to hear everyone's ideas, put it all on the table, see what it does for the American people. What is it that we can afford?''
 Three House committees have been working for months to develop a single big proposal of their own and expect to unveil it on Friday. 
 Under new cost-saving ideas being considered by the Senate Finance Committee, there would be a goal for Medicare spending that ''ensures continued sustainability and bends the Medicare cost curve.'' If the goal was not met, ''an automatic mechanism would be triggered to achieve those spending reductions.''
 An existing federal panel, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, would make recommendations to Congress on how to achieve the savings, and Congress would take an up-or-down vote on the recommendations, which could cut payments to hospitals, managed care plans and other health care providers.
 The White House has said Mr. Obama is open to the idea of giving more power to the Medicare commission. To help pay for health care legislation, he has proposed more than $600 billion of Medicare and Medicaid savings, about a third of it from hospitals, over the next 10 years.
 Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, urged his colleagues to consider the possible harm to hospitals and clinics. ''More cuts to Medicare?'' he said. ''Let's not do that right now, please.''
 Democrats are also considering changes in a proposal that would require employers to provide health benefits for their workers or contribute to the cost of such coverage. Under the new option, employers would not have to provide coverage, but would have to pay ''50 percent of the national average Medicaid costs for workers enrolled in Medicaid,'' the program for low-income people.
 Democrats plan to offer federal subsidies or tax credits to help people with low or moderate incomes buy insurance on their own. Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota said Democrats were looking for ways to limit the subsidies, a major cost. Under the latest option floated by Mr. Baucus, employers would be required to pay ''100 percent of the cost of the tax credit for workers receiving the tax credit.''
 Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said these proposals were misguided because they would create a disincentive for employers to hire low-income people.
 ''This means that small-business people won't hire anybody who's on Medicaid,'' Mr. Hatch said. ''They won't hire any low-income workers. They get penalized for doing it.''
 Some Democrats share that concern.
 Finance Committee documents also flesh out proposals to tax employer-provided health benefits in excess of a certain value -- say, $6,200 for individuals and $15,700 for families, which the documents project as the value of the standard Blue Cross plan for federal employees in 2013.
 The documents say such a tax could raise $418 billion over 10 years. But the revenue would drop sharply, to $162 billion, if the tax applied only to more affluent people: individuals with incomes over $100,000 and families over $200,000.
 For decades, employer-provided health benefits have not been counted in workers' taxable income. Mr. Baucus and many economists say the tax break is inequitable because its benefits go disproportionately to people with higher incomes.

HEADLINE: Interview With Kathleen Sebelius

 BODY:
Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, spoke to The New York Times's Kevin Sack this week about the state of health care reform on Capitol Hill. Here are edited excerpts from the 15-minute interview: 
 Q: Are you surprised the health reform process is where it is legislatively? Even seven months ago, say right after the election, could you really have imagined that in June of the president's first year, committees would be on the verge of marking up bills and scheduling votes? 
 A: Well, I think there was certainly a sentiment expressed right after the campaign and into the early month or two of the administration that given the rapid downturn in the economy and challenges -- everything from a stimulus bill to figuring out what was going to happen with homeowners and banks -- that everything else should take a back seat. And the president, from the outset, all during the transition, has certainly been consistent throughout the process, insisted that health care was a fundamental factor in fixing the economy. Cost was one of the issues he looked at very carefully, and felt that you couldn't really have a healthy economy, a healthy workforce, without really addressing the trajectory of costs in health care. And he felt it was a moral imperative, 46-47 million uninsured Americans, and that was just unacceptable.
 I've been very encouraged by his absolute focus on the fact that this is a moment -- we're not going to lose this moment. This is part of what the campaign was really all about. 'It's one of the fundamental changes people supported when they voted for me and, you know, we're going to take this opportunity and keep people at the table.' So I am encouraged that he wasn't dissuaded by lots of pundits and politicos who said, 'Oh it's too hard, it's too much, it's too heavy a lift, you know, we can't do it now, we should wait,' and really has pressed forward. Also, I'm encouraged by the House and Senate who really are, I think, actively engaged in drafting legislation. What the president wisely assessed, looking at what did not happen in the early '90s, was that unless there was some real ownership, unless members of Congress owned drafting and crafting and did some heavy lifting and then owned the final work product, it wasn't going to work. 
 Q: What do you think have been some of the key political, strategic and economic developments that have brought us to this point? 
 A: I think the underlying factor is that the status quo is not sustainable and it's not acceptable. And in many ways the economic downturn has shaken the status quo. In the early '90s, there was a sense that doing nothing was an O.K. alternative. For some people it was better than doing something that they felt would lead us in a wrong direction. I really don't know of a single stakeholder group or party in this discussion who is willing to say out loud doing nothing is O.K. I think the weight of inertia is always more powerful often than the forces of change. But in this case there's an underlying turmoil, whether it's people looking at the moral imperative, people looking at the financial imperative, and people frankly looking at what's happening to our country in terms of health outcomes. Nobody feels this is acceptable.
 Q: Is there a feeling in the administration that as well as everything has come together so far, it could all fall apart in an instant and that this coalition of stakeholders that you've got at the table could disintegrate quickly as the details become clear?
 A: There's no question that the next several weeks in Congress are not only the sort of heavy lifting but that there will be a lot of times when it appears that everything is falling apart. Anytime specific legislative language is crafted, there's something to hate about it. My guess is that will be the first focus: what do I hate about this draft, this bill, this idea, this proposal? What doesn't work? Where is it from where the goal is? But I think, again, that's always part of the legislative process. I do think there's a sense of urgency and a commitment certainly among the House and Senate leadership to try and get a bill through those bodies by the time Congress recesses in August. That sets up a time clock that -- even if it's hard -- I think that a lot of people are focused on.
 Q: Is the notion to get individual house bills by August and then conference in September?
 A: Yes, that is the optimistic timetable: getting a bill off the floor of the House and off the floor of the Senate by the August recess, which is the end of the first week in August, and then using that period of time for conferencing discussions and negotiations and trying to get something to the president's desk this fall.
 Q: Have you felt the atmosphere change in the last week to 10 days, say starting with Senator Kennedy's release of the HELP (Health, Education, Labor and Pensions)Committee bill and the president's announcement of the Medicare cuts this weekend? Are you starting to see opposition form that had been on the sidelines until now?
 A: I don't necessarily see fundamental opposition. Frankly, the Kennedy bill is still a framework and is not fully crafted. The numbers that are beginning to appear are, it turns out, very partial numbers based on a piece of the program that's in Kennedy's jurisdiction and not the rest of the program. So I think there's always a panic, you know, what does this mean, who's got this, what's going on? The president clearly has used his two recent weekly radio addresses, went to Green Bay, Wis., to a health summit, went to the American Medical Association. He is actively engaged in having a dialogue not only with key stakeholder groups but frankly with the American people, saying now is the time, there is urgency, we need to stay focused and we need to get this done.
 Q: So are you not concerned about the Congressional Budget Office release on the HELP bill? Do you think it doesn't really pose problems? (The office ''scored'' the bill produced by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's committee as costing at least $1 trillion over 10 years, while leaving 36 million people uninsured).
 A: Well, it always poses problems if you get a big price tag and the notion that there are not people covered. What I've been told is that we shouldn't spend a lot of time and energy on that because it is a partial hit on a partial bill. I think, frankly, every 15 minutes there's going to be a story like that in the next several weeks. The legislative process is always pretty messy. I'm still optimistic at the end of the day that a bill that meets what the president said all along, some fundamental principles -- cover every American who lacks health insurance right now, build on what is working in the health system, so people who have coverage and a health provider that they like and they feel is good for their family keep it, that we have a new system in place to really lower costs over all for everybody and that we begin to drive quality, which is now available to some Americans some of the time depending on where you enter the system but it is certainly not delivered in any kind of uniform basis day in and day out. So around those principles I'm convinced we're going to have a proposal.
 Q: Where do you think the major landmines are for the next couple of months, in terms of specific policy?
 A: Clearly the public option is a robust debate. And I'm encouraged that now there are variations of plans coming forward. I think competition and choice is a good thing. The president has said that all along and people are circling back to that. How we pay for the plan, which again is a core principle of the president's, that this not add to the deficit, will be a robust debate. I'm not sure there are necessarily landmines, but there are going to be some ideas vigorously debated in those two areas. And what I think people need to remember is when a price tag of approximately $1 trillion over a decade is talked about, at least if the Congress adopts much of the president's proposal, at least two thirds of that is money that is currently in the health system. It's just not being used as effectively as possible. So we're not talking about new money. For two-thirds of this plan, at least, we are talking about money that is currently being spent or misspent on health care that could be spent in a more effective strategy.
 Q: Where is the administration at this point on the notion of health care cooperatives as a replacement for the public plan?
 A: It's certainly an idea that has gotten some traction on the Hill. It's one that offers some competition. I think the details of exactly how it would work, what it means, are being discussed as we speak. But competition and choice for consumers and competition to hold costs down is something that I think the president feels is absolutely fundamental to a plan going forward. So I'm convinced again that that element will be present, something that doesn't just turn over 47 million customers to private insurers and say everybody's got to buy a product and there's no price control and there's no competition.

HEADLINE: Emissions Deal for Gazprom and Dow

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Gazprom, the energy company, has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Dow Chemical Company to expand trading in carbon dioxide emission credits intended to slow climate change, a business that is a growing sideline for the Russian company. 
 Best known for its sales of natural gas and crude oil, which produce heat-trapping carbon dioxide, Gazprom is an emerging player in the market for credits that companies can buy or trade to comply with national or international rules on greenhouse gas emissions. 
 Under the memorandum, Gazprom and Dow agreed to look at opportunities where Dow technologies could be used to reduce carbon emissions, thus generating the emission credits. The companies agreed to look at opportunities worldwide. 
 Dow could then use some of the credits to offset its own industrial activities while Gazprom's trading arm in Britain could market any excess. 
 Gazprom's customers in Europe -- in particular utilities that burn gas to generate electricity -- often need to offset their emissions under a European Union pollution trading scheme or the broader Kyoto Protocol on climate change. 
 Through its marketing and trading subsidiary in London, Gazprom in 2007 began offering utilities a bundled product of fuel along with credits needed to burn it. Gazprom buys the credits on the market or through investments in alternative energy projects elsewhere in the world. 
 However, the true promise for this business is in carbon credits that come, like the gas, from Russia. Companies in Russia and elsewhere in Eastern Europe are among the world's big producers of greenhouse gases. But they stand to benefit under the climate treaty by selling their rights to release carbon dioxide into the air, if they invest in greater efficiencies.
 The statement said the companies would also explore projects in the small carbon market in the United States. 
 As a country, Russia possesses the credits in abundance under the Kyoto Protocol, which set a baseline in 1990 for emissions, before a sharp contraction in the Russian economy greatly reduced carbon emissions. Russia can transfer those benefits to its companies to sell. 
 In 2004, when Russia ratified the protocol, officials estimated Russian companies could earn $6 billion to $9 billion selling credits created from investments in emissions-reducing technologies.

HEADLINE: Health Care Reform's Moment Arrives (Again)

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
In their heart of hearts, few in the Obama administration would have predicted late last year that they would be this well positioned by June to achieve a major victory on health care. As the economy faltered, and attention focused on Wall Street and Detroit, it seemed unthinkable that Congress would be ready to devote the summer of 2009 to the costly proposition of providing health coverage for all, a goal that has eluded presidents since Theodore Roosevelt.
 But five months after the inauguration, health care dominates the domestic agenda on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Any package that emerges will preserve the country's private insurance system, at least for now. It could nonetheless bring sweeping changes, requiring that everyone be insured, creating a government health plan to compete with commercial carriers and perhaps taxing employer-provided health benefits.
 One Senate committee began the formal drafting of its overhaul plan in a contentious session this week, while a second -- the influential Finance Committee -- delayed the release of its proposal until after the Fourth of July because of emerging concerns about its cost. In the House, hearings on a draft proposal are scheduled for next week. Both chambers are striving to vote on bills before the August recess so that a conference committee can negotiate a compromise and send it to President Obama by October. 
 Mr. Obama now rarely lets a day pass without pushing the case for broad-based change. His cool-headed analysis is increasingly sprinkled with impassioned rhetoric. ''If we do not fix our health care system,'' he told the American Medical Association on Monday, ''America may go the way of G.M.''
 That politics and economics have converged to spark such momentum ''is remarkable,'' said Peter R. Orszag, the White House budget director. ''You have industry groups that are cognizant of the need to make changes, members of Congress who have been preparing for this moment and a president quite committed to doing it. It is a rare alignment of forces.'' 
 And yet, students of history in the White House and Congress realize they are only now entering the riskiest phase, when real details begin to generate real opposition. To date, a fragile coalition of stakeholders has been kept at the table by presidential leadership and fiscal realpolitik. But it may not take much for the guiding principle of ''shared responsibility'' to fracture into shards of self-interest. 
 On Monday, the American Hospital Association expressed deep disappointment in Mr. Obama's weekend proposal to help pay for expanded coverage by cutting Medicare payments to hospitals. The next day, the United States Chamber of Commerce announced it would oppose a bill that included any one of three central elements: a new government insurance option, a requirement that businesses provide health coverage to workers or pay a fine, and the creation of a federal board to set insurance benefits. By midweek, the release of higher-than-expected cost estimates by the Congressional Budget Office had emboldened Republicans to step up their criticism, and forced the Senate Finance Committee back to the drawing board.
 Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said the administration was prepared for the undulations of the legislative process. ''There will be a lot of times when it appears that everything is falling apart,'' Ms. Sebelius said. ''Anytime specific legislative language is crafted, there's something to hate about it.''
 But Ms. Sebelius said she had been impressed by the dedication of Congressional leaders, and by Mr. Obama's ''absolute focus on the fact that this is a moment -- we're not going to lose this moment.'' 
 The moment arises from a confluence of factors: Democratic control of the White House and Congress; the exasperation of big business and consumers with uncontrollable health costs; heightened economic insecurity during the recession; the Massachusetts model for achieving near universal coverage; Mr. Obama's determination that health care is central to economic recovery; the presence of health care enthusiasts at the helm of key Congressional committees; and even Senator Edward M. Kennedy's battle against brain cancer.
 Mr. Obama, among others, has observed that if a deal is not concluded this year, when his popularity is high and lawmakers are not running for re-election, it is not likely to happen at all.
 What separates this year's initiative from past health care expansions is that it would try to address the system's shortcomings in cost, access and quality all at once. It would do so with intricately interlocking components intended to make health care affordable, end discriminatory insurance practices and redirect treatment toward prevention. 
 Whether any individual piece will produce its intended savings or improvements is impossible to tell; when judging how they might work in concert, the uncertainty is compounded. 
 Seeking broad popular support, the president and Congressional leaders have played between the 40-yard lines of the health policy spectrum. Those who favor a single-payer, government-run insurance system have been marginalized, along with those who would unleash the system to the free market. 
 Mr. Obama and the Democrats began by using the stimulus package to direct new money toward the computerization of health records and research on the effectiveness of medical procedures. In the legislation now being considered, there is broad Democratic consensus on mandating that almost all Americans have coverage, expanding eligibility for Medicaid, subsidizing insurance for the working poor, establishing an insurance marketing exchange and requiring insurers to cover those with pre-existing conditions.
 But there are profound disagreements on other proposals, including the Medicare cuts, tax increases to pay for the subsidies, and the public-plan option, which insurers regard as a threat to their existence. The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, has been searching for a compromise that might attract Republican support.
 Although the Democrats may be able to pass bills without Republican votes, bipartisanship is important to Mr. Obama because it would set the tone for the rest of his term. The essential tension of the coming few weeks will revolve around whether the Democrats can maintain momentum while working to satisfy Republican concerns. Mr. Obama is leaving the details to Congress while pronouncing that he is ''open to'' particular compromises, like substituting member-owned insurance cooperatives for the public plan.
 At a comparable stage of the Clinton health care push of 1993, ''it seemed that health care reform was unstoppable,'' former Senator Tom Daschle has written. The Clinton administration's subsequent tactical failures have become the antimatter of Mr. Obama's strategy, persuading him to move quickly, stay out of the weeds and share ownership with Congress. 
 In addressing the doctors this week, Mr. Obama argued that whatever the cost of revamping the system, ''the cost of inaction is greater.'' But he also made clear that he understood the most enduring lesson from past efforts.
 ''As clear as it is that our system badly needs reform,'' he said, ''reform is not inevitable.''

HEADLINE: Confrontation Builds in Iran With No Clear Exit

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI and MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Nazila Fathi reported from Tehran, and Michael Slackman from Cairo. Alan Cowell contributed reporting from Paris, and Neil MacFarquhar and Sharon Otterman from New York.

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
As another day of defiance, concessions and ominous threats transfixed Iran's capital, it was increasingly apparent on Thursday that there was no clear path out of a deepening confrontation that has posed the most serious challenge to the Islamic republic in its 30-year history. 
 The situation had all the hallmarks of a standoff. Hundreds of thousands of silent protesters flooded into the streets. They roared a welcome to their champion, Mir Hussein Moussavi, the opposition candidate for president whose reported defeat by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Friday's election touched off the crisis. 
 Iran's leaders offered conciliation, while simultaneously wielding repression. 
 With one hand, the government offered to talk to the opposition, inviting the three losing presidential candidates to meet with the powerful Guardian Council. While that reflected a continuing retreat from the initial insistence by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that the election results were accurate, many Iranians saw the offer as an effort to buy time and shield the ayatollah from public accountability. The Guardian Council is loyal to him. 
 Even Mr. Ahmadinejad, who has kept a defiant if low profile, made an unusual public concession. After insulting the huge crowds that poured into the street by dismissing them as ''dust,'' the president issued a statement on state television, according to The Associated Press: 
 ''I only addressed those who made riot, set fires and attacked people. Every single Iranian is valuable. The government is at everyone's service. We like everyone.''
 With the other hand, the government continued to arrest prominent reformers, limit Internet access and pressure reporters to stay off the streets, and security officials signaled their waning tolerance. 
 It was not clear whether Iran's government, made up of fractious power centers, was pursuing a calculated strategy or if the moves reflected internal disagreements, or even uncertainty.
 ''Most analysts believe the outreach is just to kill time and extend this while they search for a solution, although there doesn't seem to be any,'' said a political analyst in Tehran, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. ''This will only be a postponement of the inevitable, which is indeed a brutal crackdown.''
 Important clues could emerge Friday, when Ayatollah Khamenei is scheduled to lead the national prayer service from Tehran University. Political analysts said that they hope that the leader will reveal his ultimate intent, indicating a willingness either to appease the opposition, or to demand an end to protests. 
 There was some speculation among Iran experts in the United States of a possible compromise, with reformers being given positions in a new government. But it was unclear if that would be acceptable to the opposition, which understands that in Iran, positions do not necessarily come with power. For eight years, the reform president, Mohammad Khatami, saw his program stifled by the conservative interests of the religious leadership and its allies.
 ''There could have been a very easy political solution, and that would have been nullifying the election results, but they have refused to do that so far,'' said Mashalah Shamsolvaezin, a political analyst in Tehran. ''Postponing the resolution means they want the military to find the solutions,'' he said, referring to the Revolutionary Guards, not the army. 
 On Thursday the opposition remained firm in its demand for a new election, and it was not immediately clear how it would respond to the council's offer of talks, which could take place as early as Saturday. The meeting would include Mr. Moussavi and two other candidates, Mehdi Karroubi and Mohsen Rezai.
 Mr. Moussavi has indicated in the past that he does not trust the Guardian Council because some of its members campaigned on behalf of Mr. Ahmadinejad before the election. State radio said the Guardian Council had begun a ''careful examination'' of 646 complaints about the vote. 
 Nor was it clear what role was being played by a former Iranian president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who supported Mr. Moussavi and is in a power struggle with Ayatollah Khamenei. Today there were unconfirmed reports that two of his children had been banned from leaving the country because of their role in helping the protesters. 
 The path to resolution is so cloudy because Iran's political system is not based on coalitions or compromise. It has evolved into a winner-take-all contest, with each side holding competing views of what kind of country Iran should be: one in continuing opposition to the West, where individual freedoms are tightly restricted, or one more open to engagement with the world and greater civil liberties.
 ''We don't have a consensus on who we are,'' said a political scientist with close ties to Iran's leadership. ''Here we have ideology and ways of thinking that have nothing in common.''
 In Iran's theocracy, the supreme leader has vast power over the military, the judiciary and broadcasting. He also appoints 6 of the 12 jurists on the Guardian Council, which oversees Parliament and certifies election results, and so he exerts a profound influence on the organization. 
 The president and Parliament are elected by the people, and in recent years, popular demands have grown for social freedoms and economic gains. That pressure was easier to resist with Mr. Ahmadinejad as president, because it meant that conservatives controlled all the levers of power.
 If Mr. Moussavi had been declared the winner, his victory would have broken the hard-liners' monopoly, and that possibility was seen as a threat to the group's material interests and its ideological goals.
 Not only would the conservatives have lost control of important ministries, but also the new government might have been more amenable to talking with the United States. Opposition to the United States is a central component of the leadership's identity, and legitimacy.
 As the streets filled with protesters for yet another day, Ayatollah Khamenei appeared to be arguing that even in this crisis, everyone supported the system over which he holds ultimate power. ''The friendly atmosphere that existed before the elections should not turn into an atmosphere of conflict and confrontation after the vote because both groups of voters believe in the system,'' he was quoted as saying in Iran Daily, an English-language newspaper. 
 But the streets told a different story -- not one of confidence in the system, but rage. Starting about 4 p.m., thousands of people began gathering in Imam Khomeini Square in Tehran. The crowd quickly grew to hundreds of thousands, stretching beyond the borders of the square, one of the city's largest, and filling the surrounding streets, witnesses said. 
 The protest seemed to grow larger than demonstrations on previous days. But it was not as big as Monday's rally; that outpouring involved three million people, Tehran's mayor said Thursday, making it the largest protest since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. 
 ''These protests are nothing short of magnificent, hundreds of thousands of people marching in peace and total silence,'' said a witness to the events in Tehran. 
 At one point, a car drove into the thick of the demonstration, and Mr. Moussavi, wearing a black shirt and suit, and his wife stood on top of their vehicle to roars of approval. 
 As on previous days, the police kept to the sidelines. Although vigilante forces appeared, there were no immediate reports of clashes. 
 In a statement on his Web site, Mr. Moussavi had called on his followers to mourn those protesters killed in clashes with paramilitary forces over the past several days, and protesters responded by wearing black and carrying black candles. Many held up their fingers in a V-sign for victory. 
 Meanwhile, some protesters expressed growing fears that the government's tolerance of the persistent protests would soon wear out. 
 The Iranian authorities reported that at least seven people were killed in Tehran in the first days of unrest after the election. Student activists say seven more people have died since then in attacks by government militia on student dormitories in Tehran and in the southern city of Shiraz.
 Iranian Web sites have carried reports of violence in some other cities, but given the press restrictions now in place, those could not be verified. 
 According to news reports and a human rights group, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, the latest detainees include Ibrahim Yazdi, a former foreign minister who leads an organization called Freedom Movement. 
 Amnesty International issued a tally of detentions, saying 17 people had been detained in the northwestern city of Tabriz. It added that students appeared to have been ''particularly targeted.''
 The opposition signaled that it would not let up the pressure. State television's Press TV reported on its Web site that Mr. Moussavi was already planning to address a rally on Saturday, called by a group of reformist clerics loyal to Mr. Khatami, the former president.

HEADLINE: In a Staff Shuffle, Signs of Obama's Direction on Mideast

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
So now Dennis B. Ross, the Obama administration's senior Iran policy maker, less than three months into his State Department job, is moving to the White House, administration officials say.
 As Mark Landler of The New York Times reported on Tuesday, Mr. Ross will be taking on an expanded role covering Iran and other Middle East issues at the National Security Council. White House officials still haven't officially announced the move -- hopefully they won't keep Mr. Ross hanging on a limb for as long as the State Department did before announcing his job one night back in February. But several officials confirm that it is about to happen.
 The big question, though, is why? Obama administration officials have been cryptic when asked about the reason for the shuffle. Does it mean that the White House is the real center of the action when it comes to foreign policy? Were there too many special envoys over at the State Department? Was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton not giving Mr. Ross enough face time? Or is Mr. Ross going to assume more of a role in Mr. Obama's evolving Middle East policy, particularly in relations with Israel? 
 Senior administration officials said that Mr. Obama values Mr. Ross, who backed Mr. Obama early on during the election campaign, and wanted the benefit of his strategic thinking nearby. One official suggested that the combination of Mr. Ross, a veteran Arab-Israeli negotiator and longtime foreign policy hand, and National Security Adviser General James L. Jones would help the administration to come up with a better, more cohesive long-term strategy for America's relations with the world.
 David Makovsky, Mr. Ross's co-author in the just-published book Myths, Illusions & Peace: Finding a New Direction for America in the Middle East (Viking), offered a different possible reason: ''Dennis Ross is the Lebron James of Middle East diplomacy,'' Mr. Makovsky said.
 While the comparison is somewhat strained, the larger point is as valid as any of the other theories meant to explain Mr. Ross's move from Foggy Bottom to Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr. Obama is taking on the contentious issue of Israeli-Palestinian peace early on in his administration, in contrast to his predecessors, former President George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, who both pushed hardest for Israeli-Palestinian peace towards the end of their terms.
 Mr. Obama, then, could use Mr. Ross closer to him in the White House, to take advantage of his wide network of contacts in the Israeli political world and among the Israel lobby here in the United States, and his years of experience as a senior adviser to former presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush.
 In their book, Mr. Ross and Mr. Makovsky lay out prescriptions for how to deal with Iran, including with a blend of international diplomatic and economic pressure.
 They suggest that past efforts to stabilize the Middle East have failed because American policy leaders were working under wrong assumptions, or ''mythologies.'' In particular, they seek to knock down the idea that Israeli-Palestinian peace is the key to solving all of the Middle East's problems; too often that formula lets Arab countries and Iran off the hook. ''We ought to be deepening our relationship with Israel so that we can work more closely to resolve challenges and address new opportunities in ways that maximize the benefit to both sides,'' the two men write. 
 In recent weeks, Mr. Obama has struck a sharp tone with Israel, calling for a halt to Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank and elevating the Palestinians, in his speech to the Muslim world from Cairo earlier this month, to equal footing with the Israelis.
 Those actions have earned for Mr. Obama some wariness in Israel, where recent polls show that 51 percent of Israelis sampled said that Mr. Obama cared more about Palestinian statehood than about Israeli security. Mr. Obama's administration, from Mrs. Clinton to Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel to Mr. Ross, is filled with politicians and foreign policy experts who have high standing among the pro-Israel lobby in the United States, but moving Mr. Ross from the State Department to right next door at the White House could help to protect Mr. Obama's flank even further when it comes to Israel.
 For Mr. Ross, there's an added benefit as well: Unlike the two other high-profile special envoys at the State Department -- Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan and George Mitchell, the special envoy to the Middle East, who are both presidential envoys -- Mr. Ross has reported exclusively to Mrs. Clinton.
 Transfering to the White House with an expanded portfolio moves Mr. Ross from the periphery to the center of the Obama administration's foreign policy operation, one administration official suggested.
 Not to mention that it really is crowded in the special envoy hallways at the State Department, what with Mr. Mitchell, the Kobe Bryant of Northern Ireland diplomacy, and Mr. Holbrooke, the Michael Jordan of global diplomacy, already parked there.

HEADLINE: Out Of the Shadows

BYLINE: By Paul Krugman

 BODY:
Would the Obama administration's plan for financial reform do what has to be done? Yes and no.
 Yes, the plan would plug some big holes in regulation. But as described, it wouldn't end the skewed incentives that made the current crisis inevitable. 
 Let's start with the good news. 
 Our current system of financial regulation dates back to a time when everything that functioned as a bank looked like a bank. As long as you regulated big marble buildings with rows of tellers, you pretty much had things nailed down.
 But today you don't have to look like a bank to be a bank. As Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, put it in a widely cited speech last summer, banking is anything that involves financing ''long-term risky and relatively illiquid assets'' with ''very short-term liabilities.'' Cases in point: Bear Stearns and Lehman, both of which financed large investments in risky securities primarily with short-term borrowing.
 And as Mr. Geithner pointed out, by 2007 more than half of America's banking, in this sense, was being handled by a ''parallel financial system'' -- others call it ''shadow banking'' -- of largely unregulated institutions. These non-bank banks, he ruefully noted, were ''vulnerable to a classic type of run, but without the protections such as deposit insurance that the banking system has in place to reduce such risks.''
 When Lehman fell, we learned just how vulnerable shadow banking was: a global run on the system brought the world economy to its knees.
 One thing financial reform must do, then, is bring non-bank banking out of the shadows.
 The Obama plan does this by giving the Federal Reserve the power to regulate any large financial institution it deems ''systemically important'' -- that is, able to create havoc if it fails -- whether or not that institution is a traditional bank. Such institutions would be required to hold relatively large amounts of capital to cover possible losses, relatively large amounts of cash to cover possible demands from creditors, and so on. 
 And the government would have the authority to seize such institutions if they appear insolvent -- the kind of power that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation already has with regard to traditional banks, but that has been lacking with regard to institutions like Lehman or A.I.G.
 Good stuff. But what about the broader problem of financial excess?
 President Obama's speech outlining the financial plan described the underlying problem very well. Wall Street developed a ''culture of irresponsibility,'' the president said. Lenders didn't hold on to their loans, but instead sold them off to be repackaged into securities, which in turn were sold to investors who didn't understand what they were buying. ''Meanwhile,'' he said, ''executive compensation -- unmoored from long-term performance or even reality -- rewarded recklessness rather than responsibility.''
 Unfortunately, the plan as released doesn't live up to the diagnosis. 
 True, the proposed new Consumer Financial Protection Agency would help control abusive lending. And the proposal that lenders be required to hold on to 5 percent of their loans, rather than selling everything off to be repackaged, would provide some incentive to lend responsibly.
 But 5 percent isn't enough to deter much risky lending, given the huge rewards to financial executives who book short-term profits. So what should be done about those rewards? 
 Tellingly, the administration's executive summary of its proposals highlights ''compensation practices'' as a key cause of the crisis, but then fails to say anything about addressing those practices. The long-form version says more, but what it says -- ''Federal regulators should issue standards and guidelines to better align executive compensation practices of financial firms with long-term shareholder value'' -- is a description of what should happen, rather than a plan to make it happen. 
 Furthermore, the plan says very little of substance about reforming the rating agencies, whose willingness to give a seal of approval to dubious securities played an important role in creating the mess we're in.
 In short, Mr. Obama has a clear vision of what went wrong, but aside from regulating shadow banking -- no small thing, to be sure -- his plan basically punts on the question of how to keep it from happening all over again, pushing the hard decisions off to future regulators.
 I'm aware of the political realities: getting financial reform through Congress won't be easy. And even as it stands the Obama plan would be a lot better than nothing. 
 But to live up to its own analysis, the Obama administration needs to come down harder on the rating agencies and, even more important, get much more specific about reforming the way bankers are paid.

HEADLINE: $400 Million From Tax Amnesty Program Gives Trenton a Budget Breather

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
It is a surprise that governments, businesses and people everywhere would envy in these lean times: a windfall of more than $400 million in revenue.
 Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey announced news of the state's bounty just as legislators were about to approve a $28.6 billion budget that calls for spending cuts and tax increases. But the windfall, from the state's tax amnesty program, led lawmakers to postpone the vote to allow them and the governor to determine how to use the money to help ease New Jersey's property taxes, which are among the highest in the nation. 
 ''This money belongs to the taxpayers, and we're going to give it back to them in property tax relief,'' Mr. Corzine said. 
 But the governor, and his fellow Democrats who control the Legislature, did not commit to restoring the property tax rebate program, which had been cut during contentious budget negotiations this spring.
 The infusion of unexpected cash was a rare bit of good news in a budget season characterized by a series of disappointments. The recession and falling tax revenues have forced Mr. Corzine to slash spending and increase taxes, decisions that have no doubt contributed to his dismal showing in many public opinion polls. 
 With Mr. Corzine facing re-election this year -- and trailing his opponent, the former United States attorney for New Jersey, Christopher J. Christie, in recent surveys -- Republicans were derisive about the timing of the announcement, suggesting that it was an election-year stunt intended to sugarcoat the budget's bitter realities.
 ''Finding $500 million in the cushions of his State House office does not make Governor Corzine a fiscal wizard,'' said Jay Webber, the state Republican chairman. ''He's still going to raise taxes on New Jerseyans by over $2 billion next week, in the middle of a recession. He is raising income and payroll taxes, and our highest-in-the-nation property taxes will continue to skyrocket.''
 New Jersey's tax revenue was hit hard by Wall Street's woes and was expected to fall at least $5 billion below last year's.
 The plan legislators had been set to vote on called for a $4 billion reduction in spending compared with last year. It was expected to pass the Democratic-controlled Legislature largely along party lines. The plan called for increases in taxes on cigarettes, liquor and on state residents earning more than $400,000 a year. It also cut property tax rebates for homeowners who are not elderly or disabled, and forced state workers to take nine unpaid furlough days and delay a scheduled pay increase. 
 When Mr. Corzine announced the tax amnesty plan two months ago, state officials projected that it would reap $200 million in revenue. But the governor said Thursday that the initiative has already brought in $600 million and there are still thousands of envelopes yet to be opened and tallied.
 Democratic lawmakers were relieved by the news, and were quick to trumpet it. Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr., a Democrat from Camden, chastised Republicans who had criticized the amnesty plan and said it proved that Mr. Corzine and his legislative allies had been shrewd and prescient in responding to the nation's fiscal crisis. 
 But Mr. Corzine's opponent, Mr. Christie, called the tax windfall a symptom of the Democrats' failure to provide steady leadership in handling the state's finances.
 ''It is now clear that Jon Corzine has no control over the budget or our government,'' Mr. Christie said. ''He promised four years ago to change the way Trenton budgeted, but this budget uses billions in one-shot gimmicks -- including this latest tax amnesty windfall -- that will have to be made up in future budgets. This kind of haphazard governing by chance just doesn't cut it when we're facing 8.8 percent unemployment, skyrocketing property taxes and real pain for all middle-class New Jerseyans.''
 The Legislature is now scheduled to debate a revised budget bill next Monday and vote on it on Thursday. The State Constitution requires that a budget be in place by July 1.

HEADLINE: Christie Aims at Democrats Unhappy With Poor Schools

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
He's white, he's conservative, and his support is strongest in New Jersey's suburbs, where the public schools include some of the nation's best.
 Yet Christopher J. Christie, the Republican candidate for governor, is hunting for votes in cities like Newark, Camden and Trenton, where Democrats routinely pile up big margins, but where black and Hispanic parents are increasingly running out of patience with the public schools, among the nation's worst.
 A battered economy, rising unemployment and tax increases are expected to be the major focus of this year's campaign for governor, as Mr. Christie seeks to oust Gov. Jon S. Corzine. 
 But what could emerge as the sleeper issue is Mr. Christie's push for education reform: merit pay for teachers, more charter schools, and above all, vouchers as a way to give poor and minority children better educational choices and create competition that would improve the public schools.
 Fighting for education reform also allows Mr. Christie, whose party affiliation is a liability in blue-leaning New Jersey, to align himself with Democrats. In Washington, Education Secretary Arne Duncan is encouraging charter schools and merit pay, using federal stimulus money as a lever. 
 ''It's an issue whose time has come,'' Mr. Christie said in an interview. ''When a Republican candidate for governor is advocating the same thing as President Obama's secretary of education, who's out of step? I think Jon Corzine's out of step.''
 Mr. Christie said that he did not expect to carry any heavily Democratic cities. But he is gambling that school choice has become popular enough among urban blacks and Latinos that he can cut into their support for Mr. Corzine, who opposes it.
 The strategy, not without risk, is inspired in part by history: In 1993, lackluster minority turnout helped Christie Whitman defeat Jim Florio, another unpopular Democratic incumbent. 
 Michael DuHaime, Mr. Christie's top strategist, said that merely holding down Mr. Corzine's margins in urban areas could be decisive. ''You'll know if we won on election night not by how much we win Ocean and Sussex by,'' he said, naming Republican strongholds in the outer suburbs, ''but how much do we lose Hudson, Essex and Camden by.''
 A rift within the Democratic Party has created the opening for Mr. Christie, with the powerful teachers' union, the New Jersey Education Association, and its allies -- Mr. Corzine chief among them -- arrayed against a small but potent cadre of urban lawmakers, ministers and community and tenant activists.
 Democrats who have broken with the union include Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark; Raymond J. Lesniak, an influential state senator from Elizabeth; Assemblyman Joseph Cryan, the party's state chairman; George E. Norcross III, a South Jersey power broker; the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, longtime head of the Black Ministers' Council; and Martin Perez, founder of the Latino Leadership Alliance, an umbrella for dozens of groups and hundreds of churches.
 They have joined with conservatives to push for a voucher program in the eight cities in the state that have the worst schools. Their pet bill would let businesses direct part of their state taxes to scholarships for needy students in those areas to attend private or parochial schools.
 Allies of the teachers' union repeatedly blocked the bill from moving out of various committees. But last year, its proponents said, they won a promise from Barbara Buono, the chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee, to allow a vote if they gathered support from a majority of the 15 members on her panel. 
 They eventually did. But on March 5, Ms. Buono -- who is vying to be Governor Corzine's running mate as lieutenant governor -- said things had changed and there would be no vote, according to several people who attended a testy meeting with her that day.
 ''Why do you want to do this to the governor?'' she said, according to three people in the room. (Ms. Buono, in an interview, denied ever promising to let the bill come up for a vote, and called the voucher program too expensive.)
 This week, Mr. Jackson and the Black Ministers' Council sent questionnaires to Mr. Corzine and Mr. Christie asking about school choice, the voucher bill and related issues. Mr. Jackson is scheduled to appear with Mr. Christie at a Camden high school on Monday. And he has told people privately that if he does not endorse Mr. Christie outright, he might sit out the election and encourage others to do so.
 Mr. Perez, of the Latino Leadership Alliance, is less coy. Four years ago, the alliance endorsed Mr. Corzine. But he called Mr. Christie, a former federal prosecutor, ''probably the best United States attorney we've ever had,'' and described Governor Corzine as well-intentioned but ''ineffective.'' He said education reform, including school choice, was his top concern.
 ''It's a tossup right now,'' he said of the alliance's endorsement.
 Democrats in Mr. Corzine's corner scoffed at such talk, saying that voters do not choose a governor based only on school choice. Mr. Corzine is preferable on many other issues dear to minority voters, they said, and they questioned whether Mr. Jackson or Mr. Perez would actually abandon the Democratic candidate.
 ''I don't think any real leader tells anybody to sit out an election,'' said Bonnie Watson Coleman, the Senate majority leader, who represents Ewing, just outside Trenton.'' Of Mr. Jackson, she said, ''At the end of the day, I think he stays where he is.''
 As he tries to exploit Democratic disunity, meanwhile, Mr. Christie faces risks, primarily in antagonizing the 200,000-strong teachers' union.
 In the 2001 governor's race, the union helped the Democrat, James E. McGreevey, persuade voters that Bret D. Schundler, the Republican candidate, wanted to rob the public schools of some $600 million. Bill Pascoe, who managed Mr. Schundler's campaign, said the union's phone banks and army of canvassers deeply wounded the Republican.
 Still, Mr. Pascoe said, the gambit holds potential for Mr. Christie.
 ''If he takes Reginald Jackson or Cory Booker to the worst school in Newark, and they do a photo op and Chris Christie says, 'Fifty years ago, Democrats stood in the schoolhouse doors and told little black kids you can't go in; today Democrats tell little black kids you can't get out' -- then, you've got an issue,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Senators Skeptical of Plan On Financial Regulation

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama's plan to overhaul the regulatory structure of the nation's financial system faces formidable obstacles on Capitol Hill, if the reception accorded Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, on Thursday was any indication.
 Mr. Geithner went before the Senate banking committee and urged the lawmakers to act quickly on the president's plan. 
 ''Every financial crisis of the last generation has sparked some effort at reform,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''But past efforts have begun too late, after the will to act has subsided.'' 
 One senator after another said his or her will to act was in no danger of subsiding. But they also signaled an unwillingness to accept the White House recommendations intact, particularly the idea of expanding the powers of the Federal Reserve to enable it to regulate risk across the financial system.
 ''I believe that we can find common ground in a number of the areas contained in your proposal,'' the committee's chairman, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said in a comment that typified the lukewarm reaction to the administration's plan. 
 As for the Federal Reserve's role, Mr. Dodd described himself as ''open on the issue.'' But, borrowing a quote from an economics professor, he went on to wonder aloud if giving the Federal Reserve more authority ''is like a parent giving his son a bigger, faster car right after he crashed the family station wagon.'' 
 The panel's ranking Republican, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, said he did not want to allow the administration's recommendations ''to limit the debate we are about to undertake.'' And while agreeing that the present regulatory setup is antiquated and inadequate, Mr. Shelby said he thought the Federal Reserve already had enough to do, with a lot of responsibilities that ''conflict at times.'' 
 Mr. Geithner tried to knock down any impression that the Federal Reserve would become much more powerful. ''Our proposals for the additional authority we're giving the Fed are actually quite modest and build on their existing authority,'' he said. 
 Moreover, he said, the Fed was not responsible for the current situation, and ''it has a greater knowledge and feel for broader market developments than is true for any other entity in that context.''
 Mr. Geithner is sure to face more sharp questioning. He was to have appeared Thursday afternoon before the House Financial Services Committee, but the session was postponed because of heavy House business on the floor. 
 At least twice, Mr. Geithner described the White House plan as ''pragmatic'' and meant to do what is essential, rather than what would be ideal. ''It does not propose reforms that, while desirable, would not move us toward achieving those core objectives and creating a more stable system.''
 But Democrats and Republicans alike voiced skepticism, if not outright hostility. For instance, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said he shared his colleagues' concerns about the administration's blueprint, including ''this expansion of authority within the Fed.''
 Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, was almost disdainful. ''Your plan puts a lot of faith in the Federal Reserve's ability to spot risk and exercise its power to prevent the next crisis,'' he told Mr. Geithner. ''If the Fed and other regulators had been doing their jobs and paying attention to what the banks and other firms were doing earlier this decade, they almost certainly could have prevented the mess.''
 Aware that some legislators have suggested that a council of regulators, not a single agency, might be better for overseeing large institutions, Mr. Geithner said in his opening remarks that ''you cannot convene a committee to put out a fire.''
 The administration's proposal for a new agency to protect consumers in their banking transactions was more warmly received. Mr. Dodd applauded the idea and lashed out at banking interests who have already criticized it, saying that the people who created the mess ''are the ones now arguing that consumers ought not to be protected,'' he said.
 Mr. Geithner alluded to one element of the recent, and still not entirely resolved, financial crisis that has caused particular anger among the public. From now on, he said, ''no one should assume that the government will step in to bail them out if their firm fails.''
 An intriguing question was posed by Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado. If the regulatory setup the administration is advocating had been in place not many months ago, would things be different now?
 Such ''what if'' questions are ultimately unanswerable, of course, but Mr. Geithner tried anyhow. 
 ''Banks would not have taken on so much risk,'' he said. ''Institutions that were not regulated banks would not have been permitted to take on that level of risk; consumers would have been less vulnerable to the kind of predation we saw, particularly in mortgage markets.''
 And Washington, he said, ''would have had the ability to act earlier, more swiftly to contain the damage posed by the inevitable pressures that come when firms fail.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and Switzerland Agree To Share More Tax Data

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The United States and Switzerland have agreed to increase the amount of tax information they share to help crack down on tax evasion.
 The Treasury Department said Fridaythat the two nations had concluded negotiations on an amended tax treaty. The discussions took place as American legal authorities were conducting investigations into accusations that the giant Swiss bank UBS helped thousands of American customers evade taxes. 
 The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said the Obama administration was committed to reducing offshore tax evasion.
 ''This treaty will increase our ability to enforce our tax law and will help bring an end to an era of offshore accounts and investments being used for tax evasion,'' Mr. Geithner said in a statement.
 The protocol, which the two countries are expected to sign in the next few months, would revise the existing treaty to allow for a greater exchange of information as permitted by a model income tax convention adopted by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
 The negotiations over a strengthened tax treaty were taking place as American authorities have been pressing UBS to hand over the names of 52,000 clients suspected of tax evasion.
 A federal judge in Miami has scheduled hearings for July 13-15 on the Internal Revenue Service's effort to obtain the names of the 52,000 American account holders. The Swiss government had asserted in court filings that the case might jeopardize the progress of the tax treaty talks and that turning over the names would violate Swiss law.
 UBS already has paid $780 million in fines and restitution to settle accusations that it helped American customers evade taxes.
 In a statement issued in Bern, the Swiss economics ministry said the agreement was reached after a final three days of negotiations. The ministry said that Swiss businesses and local governments would be given the chance to comment on the proposed changes. Switzerland's Federal Council and Parliament will decide if the new agreement is allowed to take effect.

HEADLINE: With Afghan People in Mind, a New Commander Rethinks How to Measure Success

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The new American commander in Afghanistan has ordered a 60-day review of the entire military mission to identify better ways to separate the population from insurgents, an assessment that is expected to lead to new economic and military steps to carve fighters off from the Taliban. 
 Over the next week, the commander, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, is scheduled to crisscross Afghanistan to meet provincial leaders, villagers and American and allied officials, while counterinsurgency experts from inside and outside the government assist in the top-to-bottom review. 
 Although the review is in its preliminary stages, General McChrystal is already pledging to expand the fight beyond the purely military campaign to defeat the insurgents.
 ''The measure of effectiveness will not be enemy killed,'' General McChrystal told a Senate committee at his confirmation hearing on June 2. ''It will be the number of Afghans shielded from violence.'' 
 The comment was viewed as particularly significant coming from General McChrystal, who was trained in ''hearts and minds'' counterinsurgency theory as a young Green Beret but more recently spent five years commanding the most secret capture-or-kill teams in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 General McChrystal took command this week, as the American military starts to double its number of personnel members in Afghanistan, to about 68,000 by late summer. 
 More than a dozen senior military officers and Pentagon civilians involved in the review described the effort to refocus military planning, tactics and operations, but spoke on the condition of anonymity because the assessment was just getting under way.
 Military planners predict that the increased troop presence will allow the military to raise the stakes on insurgent ''day fighters'' who pick up arms less for ideology than for money to survive. Until now, they could join the insurgency ad hoc and at relatively little risk of being captured, wounded or killed.
 ''We are going to bring the hurt to the insurgency and offer them an existential choice,'' said another senior military officer.
 ''Those who are ideologically committed -- we don't expect them to change. They will fight, and they will die,'' the officer said. ''But for the many for whom ideology is not the motivation, we are going to offer them a serious motivation to stop, to make another choice.''
 The key, of course, is creating other employment. Senior advisers to General McChrystal acknowledge that the increase in troop levels must be complemented by more civilian support for the Afghan government as it struggles to deliver economic opportunities, education, health care and a rule of law. 
 One key will be increasing the size and professionalism of Afghanistan's security forces. Another will be assuring that farmers who agree to cultivate legitimate crops will be protected from intimidation by narcotics bosses, whose proceeds form a main base of financial support to the insurgency.
 The military says it will also seek to form a social contract with farmers and small business leaders: If they choose legitimate crops and pay taxes, they will be guaranteed secure transportation routes to markets without the pressure of bribes at illegal checkpoints.
 The impact of the economy on the insurgency is significant, officials said. Even a primitive economy that is self-sustaining will reduce the number of unemployed men who join the insurgency for day wages. 
 A major task will be gaining people's trust in government. Many Afghans, with their history of powerful regional warlords, remain unconvinced of the legitimacy -- or staying power -- of the central government and its American sponsors.
 ''Unless and until the government can be seen to rise above corruption, it will never find acceptance among the people,'' said one senior military officer.
 Commanders want to measure whether increased security -- and, with it, increased economic vitality -- can generate more support for the government. In preparation for the troop increase, the military conducted a series of public opinion polls to gauge how Afghans view their government and the quality of their lives.
 Even with the increase in American forces, senior advisers to General McChrystal warned that the military still did not have sufficient troops to do all it wanted. This will prompt commanders to focus on population centers and, in the first months of the troop increase, even surrender the fight in isolated and unpopulated valleys that provide a haven for insurgents.
 ''A key to the strategy is to determine where should our limited forces be applied and to what end,'' said a senior military officer in Afghanistan. ''The population centers are key to this, and the vast terrain of Afghanistan that may allow for refuge of insurgents may be less of a priority, at least for the near term.''
 But the larger troop presence should allow General McChrystal, in cooperation with Afghan forces, to put in place a fuller counterinsurgency strategy to clear out insurgents, hold territory and build economic and government institutions. 
 In an important addition to this strategy of clear, hold and build, the McChrystal team is officially adding a fourth goal: to sustain progress, officers said.
 With widespread outrage over civilian deaths from allied bombing, General McChrystal will also review the rules for ordering in warplanes to drop heavy bombs, officers said.
 Analysts in Washington and Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, are also trying to map the insurgency to help the military understand the varied, regional nature of the fighters, and to craft different tactics to counter the differing motivations behind those who fight against allied and Afghan forces.
 For example, insurgents in southern Afghanistan mostly live in southern Afghanistan, while those in the east often fight from havens across the border in Pakistan.
 Those with a haven in Pakistan attack but surrender ground when confronted with an overwhelming force -- to disappear and melt away, and then come back once that force leaves, according to Defense Department officials.
 ''Some of the fiercest fighting we run into is where it's local,'' said one Defense Department official, because those fighters are rooted in the community by tribe or local interests in narcotics, lumber harvesting or smuggling.

HEADLINE: Retired or Closing In on It, And Protecting a Nest Egg

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
The stock market's damage has already been done. And if you're one of those people near or already in retirement, you already know you're going to have to work longer, save more or spend less.
 But what should you do right now with the money you have left? Should you wade back into the stock market, if you bailed out when the market was plunging? Or if you watched your investments drop and then recover a little in the last few months, should you just hold on? What happens if the market doesn't fully recover for a long time? (That happened in Japan in the '90s.)
 This economic downturn has been steep enough and frightening enough to undermine the idea that the stock market, over time, will always deliver. So a lot of investors have retreated to a more conservative stance. 
 The wisdom of that move is debatable. The investment industry warns that becoming too defensive is costly in the long run. Its argument goes something like this: People are living longer, retirement may last 25 or 30 years and stocks are supposed to protect you from the ravages of inflation. And since stocks tend to outpace most investments over long periods of time, the industry says, your savings will do all right in the end. 
 But some people are no longer comfortable with that logic. There's even a new study that contends holding stocks over long periods of time may be riskier than previously thought. Robert F. Stambaugh, a finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the report, said most investment research only accounted for the risk of short-term market swings around the stock market's average gain over time. It doesn't factor in the fact, he said, that the average itself is subject to change. 
 So what should retirees and pre-retirees make of all of this?
 ''If another decline in the market is going to bankrupt you or put you out of business or destroy your retirement account, you should not go back into the stock market,'' said John C. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard and viewed by many as the father of index investing. ''It's not complicated. The stock market can go up and down a lot and nobody really knows how much and when.''
 What's worked for Mr. Bogle may not work for you, but his method isn't a bad place to start. ''I have this threadbare rule that has worked very well for me,'' he said in an interview this week. ''Your bond position should equal your age.'' Mr. Bogle, by the way, is 80 years old.
 That's a rather conservative recommendation, by many financial planners' standards. In fact, Vanguard itself offers products that are more aggressive. Its target-date funds -- whose investment mix grows more conservative as retirement nears -- recommend that people retiring in 2010 (generally, people who are 65) should split their savings evenly between stock and bonds.
 Charles Schwab, by contrast, has recently reduced the risk for its target-date funds. The company's 2010 fund will allocate about 40 percent to stock funds next year, down from 50 percent in the past. ''It's a reflection that our clients' appetite for risk has changed,'' said Peter Crawford, a senior vice president at Charles Schwab Investment Management.
 But you shouldn't simply view your investments through the lens of how much you allocate to different investments (though you will need to come up with a plan). Instead, you should work your way backward. First, consider how much you will need to live when you're retired and then figure out how you'll pay for it.
 Nearing Retirement
 Ideally, you should have started to slowly shrink your stock position over your working career. But some financial planners have become more conservative about that. Before the market's sharp downturn, Warren McIntyre, a financial planner in Troy, Mich., typically reduced his clients' stock allocations by about 1 percent each year. Now, for older investors, he ratchets down their stocks by 2 percent each year once they reach 60. So a 65-year-old's investments would be evenly split between stocks and bonds. 
 Other planners are taking even more defensive positions. ''We are still very concerned about the status of the economic recovery and remain quite defensive as a result,'' said Chip Addis, a financial planner in Wayne, Pa., who invests his clients' portfolios in only 40 percent stocks.
 Of course, there's no one formula. Milo Benningfield, a fee-only planner in San Francisco, for instance, said he put a 61-year-old client in a portfolio with 60 percent in diversified stocks and alternatives (like real estate) and 40 percent in fixed-income (largely split among high-quality, short-term and intermediate-term bonds and cash). But this client can afford to take that risk -- the client owns a house, rental property and has other holdings outside the portfolio.
 The picture may change for pre-retirees who are 61 and close to meeting their savings goals, but can't afford to lose any money. ''We would ask ourselves to what degree, if any, can you afford equities,'' Mr. Benningfield said. If inflation was their only concern, he might invest their money across a ladder of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, which are backed by the government and keep pace with inflation.
 But since retirees generally spend money on entertainment, health care and food -- whose costs often exceed the general rate of inflation -- he said he might invest 40 to 50 percent of their money in a portfolio of diversified stock funds (with at least 30 percent of that in international stock funds). But, he added, ''Cash is risky, stocks and bonds are risky, life is risky.'' 
 As to those investors who got out of stocks, Mr. Bogle said it might be time for some of them to get back in. ''But I would take two years to do it,'' he said. ''Maybe average in over eight quarters, and do an eighth each quarter. I am just not in favor of doing things in a hurry or emotionally.''
 And then? ''Don't touch it,'' he said, emphatically. ''One of my rules is don't do something. Just stand there.''
 Retirement
 Several planners recommended different variations on a similar strategy for retirees. Set aside anywhere from eight to 15 years of your expected expenses -- that includes food, utilities, housing, insurance -- in bonds and cash. That way, you'll never have to tap your stock holdings at the worst possible moment.
 ''Once you have that in place, you feel like you can weather any economic storm,'' said Chip Simon, a financial planner in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
 When you have figured out how much it costs to live each year, the next step is to see how much Social Security will cover. Whatever is left needs to be financed by your retirement portfolio. And the general rule of thumb is that you shouldn't withdraw more than 4 percent of your portfolio (adjusted for inflation) each year. 
 There are different ways to invest your cash and bond holdings.
 Rick Rodgers, a financial planner in Lancaster, Pa., invests 10 years of annual expenses in a bond ladder, with an equal amount coming due every six months. The ladder can include high-quality corporate bonds, Treasury notes, certificates of deposit or municipal bonds, depending on the retiree's tax bracket. Mr. Simon takes a similar approach using a 15-year ladder of zero-coupon bonds. He says that investors can start building the ladder in their 50s, with the first rung coming due the year they retire. 
 Some advisers also say you can guarantee you'll be able to cover your basic expenses by purchasing an immediate annuity from an insurance company. The annuity pays you a stream of income until you die. ''You can buy four small ones from four insurers if you are worried about insolvency risk,'' said Dallas L. Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit Research Institute. ''And if you are just worried about inflation protection, you can do TIPS.''
 But you should probably delay any annuity purchases because payouts rise with interest rates. With current rates so low, and the possibility of inflation later, advisers said it's best to wait a few years. You can also research inflation-adjusted annuities, but you'll receive lower payouts in the beginning, Mr. Benningfield said, adding: ''Less than most people can stomach.''

Mets Cut Ticket Prices for Coming Games
 Perhaps it's the opposition, perhaps it's the economy, perhaps it's the Mets' mediocre record. Whatever the reason, the Mets are discounting tickets to their coming home games. 
 Select tickets for the three games against the Tampa Bay Rays are going for half price, and tickets for the four-game set against the St. Louis Cardinals, who will play at Citi Field starting Monday, are being discounted by one-third. 
 The Mets ran similar discounts earlier this year when the team played the Washington Nationals and the Florida Marlins, two traditionally weak draws. The Rays, however, advanced to the World Series last year, and the Cardinals are playing well and are one of the most popular teams in the National League. KEN BELSON

HEADLINE: Federal Regulators Close 3 Small Banks

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Federal regulators closed three small banks on Friday, bringing the number of bank failures to 40 so far this year. The largest of the banks closed on Friday was the Cooperative Bank of Wilmington, N.C., with $970 million in assets and $774 million in deposits, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said. 
 The failure is expected to cost the F.D.I.C. deposit insurance fund an estimated $217 million. First Bank of Troy, N.C., will purchase all the deposits, except about $57 million in brokered deposits. The F.D.I.C. said it would pay the brokers directly.
 The Cooperative Bank's 24 branches will reopen on Monday as branches of First Bank.
 The F.D.I.C. also announced the failure of Southern Community Bank of Fayetteville, Ga., which had $377 million in assets and $307 million in deposits. The failure is expected to cost the insurance fund an estimated $114 million.
 United Community Bank of Blairsville, Ga., agreed to assume the insured deposits of Southern Community Bank, whose five branches will reopen on Monday as branches of United Community Bank.
 In Kansas, the F.D.I.C. said regulators closed First National Bank of Anthony, with $156.9 million in assets and $142.5 million in deposits. The failure is expected to cost the insurance fund an estimated $32.2 million.
 Bank of Kansas in South Hutchinson agreed to assume the insured deposits of First National Bank of Anthony, whose six branches will reopen on Monday as branches of Bank of Kansas.
 Customers can get access to their money over the weekend by check, teller machine or debit card, the F.D.I.C. said.
 The rate of bank failures has accelerated in 2009 as the 18-month-old recession continues. There were 25 failures in all of 2008 and just three in 2007.

HEADLINE: 10.1% Jobless Rate in West Is 25-Year High in Region

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in the West surpassed 10 percent last month, the first time that regional threshold has been broken in about 25 years. Nationwide, eight states set record highs and only two, Nebraska and Vermont, did not report increases. 
 The Labor Department reported Friday that in 48 states and the District of Columbia employment deteriorated last month. The fallout from the longest recession since World War II was the worst in Michigan as automakers cut tens of thousands of jobs, pushing the unemployment rate to 14.1 percent.
 The West reported the highest jobless rate of any region, 10.1 percent. The last time any region had a rate of at least 10 percent was September 1983, when the country was emerging from a recession and the Midwest reported a rate of 10.1 percent. The region includes California, where the jobless rate jumped to a record 11.5 percent last month; Nevada, where it is a record 11.3 percent; and other states that were affected when the housing boom went bust, snatching jobs and wealth.
 The other six states with record highs based on figures dating from 1976 were Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
 Nebraska's jobless rate dipped last month, while Vermont's was flat.
 On the layoff front, Arizona and Florida had the largest monthly percentage decreases, followed by Oklahoma and Arkansas, Kentucky and Michigan.
 The national jobless rate has hit a quarter-century high of 9.4 percent, and more pain lies ahead as millions of unemployed Americans find scarce job opportunities.
 Even if the recession ends this year, as the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and other economists predict, the unemployment rate will keep rising. Companies will not increase hiring until they are certain their sales and profits are rebounding and any economic recovery will endure.
 As a result, the unemployment rate is expected to hit 10 percent this year. Some predict it could rise to 11 percent by summer 2010 before starting to decline slowly. The highest rate since World War II was 10.8 percent at the end of 1982.
 After Michigan, the state with the highest jobless rate in May was Oregon at 12.4 percent, followed by Rhode Island and South Carolina at 12.1 percent each. California had the fourth-highest jobless rate.
 The few bright spots: North Dakota and Nebraska each reported unemployment rates of 4.4 percent, the nation's lowest. North Dakota has been helped by its oil production and extraction work, while Nebraska was supported by farm businesses. Neither state got carried away with the housing boom, or had huge declines in household wealth like California.
 By region, the Midwest had the second-highest rate, at 9.8 percent, underscoring the toll of job losses in manufacturing. The South's unemployment rate was 8.9 percent, and the Northeast had the lowest at 8.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Big Retailers Shift Strategy In a Recession

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Shopping as we know it is on the brink of major change. 
 Hammered by the recession, some of the nation's biggest retailers are seizing the moment to reinvent their business strategies. And the impact will mean both sweeping changes in the merchandise on their shelves and subtler alterations, like how many pantyhose to keep in stock. 
 High-end stores like Neiman Marcus, Saks and Coach will offer more midpriced merchandise. Many chains, including Wal-Mart, will carry less inventory and fewer brands. The likes of Sears and J. C. Penney will put self-service computers in stores so customers can browse collections or buy out-of-stock items. And retailers of all stripes will offer more exclusive merchandise and more attentive customer service. 
 One of the biggest changes consumers are likely to see is greater personalization and regionalization of merchandise. 
 An initiative known as ''My Macy's'' requires the retailer's merchandisers and other planners to go into stores each week to learn from the sales staff -- who keep logs at the cash registers -- what shoppers are requesting, snapping up or complaining about. 
 For instance, when strapless and bare-shouldered dresses were selling well everywhere except Salt Lake City and Pittsburgh, Macy's employees in those stores knew the problem was that their customers wanted more modest dresses. So they passed that information on to the merchandisers. Out went the strapless dresses; in came dresses with cap sleeves. And sales went from lackluster to robust. 
 Under the new system it will not be unusual for a local Macy's to stock the merchandise customers request, be it wide-width shoes or Sean John suits, and for those offerings to be different from the ones in a Macy's store 100 miles away. 
 ''I think what Macy's is embarking on is perhaps the largest transformation in our company in a couple of decades,'' said Terry J. Lundgren, president and chief executive. 
 The Macy's change is just one example of a wide range of initiatives retailers are pursuing as they struggle to cope with an economy where sales are lower than they were just a few years ago.
 At high-end stores, the era of ever-escalating prices on luxury goods appears to be over. In the future, consumers will still be able to buy chic brand names, but at a wider range of prices.
 ''Our customer loves our brands,'' said Stephen I. Sadove, chairman and chief executive of Saks. ''They don't want to trade down to lower brands. But they want more of a range in price within the brands that they love.''
 And that is what retailers intend to give them. Burton M. Tansky, president and chief executive of Neiman Marcus Group, told investors on a conference call last week that ''we're working with the designers to try and ease a portion of their collections into a new price range.'' 
 Prices will also be lower at some ''affordable luxury'' chains, like Coach, which is increasing the proportion of handbags it sells for less than $300. About 50 percent of the company's handbags will cost $200 to $300, in contrast to about 30 percent of handbags last year. 
 Another change is that consumers will have fewer brands from which to choose. Wal-Mart, Target, Home Depot, and PetSmart are just a few of the chains winnowing their brands. As Home Depot's executive vice president for merchandising, Craig Menear, put it: consumers are ''time-starved'' and ''looking for simplification in the entire shopping experience.'' 
 That may delight minimalists, because it will be easier to find items on the shelves. But it also limits choice.
 Another potential drawback for consumers is that stores may run out of stock more quickly than in the past because, as Mr. Lundgren of Macy's explained, ''retailers learned that you can't get out of the merchandise that you ordered months before.'' 
 ''Instead,'' he said, ''you're more likely to see retailers ordering fewer of each individual size and taking that risk that they'll sell out and not capture every sale, rather than the risk of having too much inventory left over to mark down.'' 
 Another trend is on the horizon: seasonal transitions for apparel will probably have shorter lead times. With strapped consumers buying only what they need when they need it, it has occurred to retailers that selling swimsuits to New Yorkers in early March is not necessarily a winning strategy. And so chains are beginning to work with suppliers to shorten the time between ordering and delivering merchandise. 
 Consumers will also see even more of the exclusive collaborations between retailers and prominent designers that are so prevalent today. That will help distinguish stores as well as avoid price wars because the same items will not be sold at multiple chains.
 Yet another change will be the obliteration of any remaining divide between online and in-store shopping. 
 In Sears stores, ''appliance research centers'' with computers are enabling customers to compare local competitors' prices. (If Sears does not offer the best price, it will match the lowest offer and hand over 10 percent of the difference.) Four J. C. Penney stores in Dallas are testing ''FindMore'' machines the size of arcade games, letting customers see every item J. C. Penney sells and find out if the item they want is in the store or online.
 Shopping by cellphone will also become widespread. 
 ''Everything we are developing is with a mind-set that it's going to be running on a handset,'' said J. C. Penney's chief information officer, Thomas M. Nealon.
 Despite all the new technology, consumers will be getting more attention from sales staff. During the last few years, retailers did not have to work hard to separate consumers from their dollars. 
 But those days are over. More middle-market chains are striving for Nordstrom-quality service to win customers. Even Home Depot has adopted its ''most extensive customer service training ever,'' its chairman and chief executive, Frank Blake, told investors and retailing analysts last week. 
 Of course, luxury chains have always featured a high level of attentiveness. But the chains say that in this economy, customers have heightened expectations. Saks, for one, has invested tens of millions of dollars in the last year on software that provides its sales staff easy access to information about client purchases and preferences, so that a returning customer might be greeted by a sales representative who recalls the shopper's suit size and penchant for Christian Louboutin heels. 
 Economists and analysts forecast that it will take up to 10 years to return to 2007 levels of consumer spending -- which makes now a good time for retailers to re-imagine the future. Paul A. Laudicina, chairman and managing officer of A. T. Kearney, the management consulting firm, noted that major consumer innovations like Neoprene and Teflon came out of the Depression. 
 Mr. Lundgren pointed out that if consumers were still throwing money around, stores might not want to alter strategies that were still working. 
 But with today's recession, he said, ''now is the time to aggressively rock the boat.''

HEADLINE: For 'Modern Gals,' Religion as Off-the-Rack Therapy

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
Dear Jillian, 
 Please forgive the first-name greeting, but it seems the proper way to reply to your ''Hi Peter'' e-mail message of June 4. 
 What was surprising was not the informality of your note -- everyone knows that for public relations folks, journalists are on an automatic first-name basis -- but that it came from Marie Claire magazine. Fashion writing has not loomed large in this column. 
 ''Today's hard economic times,'' you helpfully explained, ''have a profound effect not only on our bank accounts but on our sense of hope and psychological well-being,'' an insight, you must admit, that has not escaped millions of Americans, to count only those who still have bank accounts. 
 Still, you announced that it had inspired an article in the current issue of Marie Claire featuring accounts by ''five modern career gals'' of ''how their belief in faith helped them through the hardest of struggles.'' 
 The article is titled ''Cheaper Than Therapy.'' 
 The idea of faith as therapy, you probably know, is not exactly new. Fifty years ago, Norman Vincent Peale preached the power of positive thinking, and Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen insisted that the Roman Catholic confessional was more effective than the psychoanalyst's couch. And the language of healing, both physical and psychological, is prominent in many religious traditions. 
 Still, you should anticipate the objection that promoting religion as bargain-basement therapy is something of a category mistake, like publishing someone's account of voting under the banner ''More Engrossing Than Sudoku'' or trumpeting romance as ''Juicier Than Fish Sticks'' or describing the joys of cooking as ''Faster Than Gardening.'' 
 Then there's the word ''cheap.'' It doesn't appear a lot elsewhere in these pages. This is not to complain about the items surrounding your article about the effect of today's hard economic times on our sense of hope -- the $4,100 skirt or the $4,995 dress or the $1,250 clutch or the $315 diamond-dust-based body treatment at one spa or the $250 head-to-toe feng shui scrub-down and massage at another. 
 After all, Marie Claire also features what it calls ''steals'' and ''best buys,'' although nothing that is ''cheaper,'' except of course faith. Be warned, however. Some grump will probably write you about the best-known religious use of ''cheap'' in recent times. It occurs in the opening sentence of ''The Cost of Discipleship,'' by the Protestant theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was executed for his role in a plot to assassinate Hitler. 
 ''Cheap grace is the deadly enemy of our church,'' Bonhoeffer wrote. ''We are fighting today for costly grace.'' Perhaps your ''five modern career gals'' are too young to have heard of Bonhoeffer; otherwise they might have felt nervous about their tendency to treat religious faith like comfort food or a fashion accessory. Tell them not to worry. Bonhoeffer was the kind of guy who wouldn't know a Manolo Blahnik from a Vera Wang. 
 What remains puzzling, though, is exactly what their belief had to do with ''today's hard economic times'' or how it ''helped them through the hardest of struggles.'' 
 The Jew among them seems mainly preoccupied by the glitches that a Hebrew first name creates for her dating life -- it seems she has to rush to assure guys of her ''pork-eating ways.'' Worse, it sometimes provokes discussions about Israeli politics, including a tiff at a pizza party that ''cast a major pall over the rest of the evening.'' 
 Maybe Marie Claire ought to rethink its standards for ''the hardest of struggles.'' 
 The Muslim's struggle is to find private places, like a dressing room at the Gap or a corner of an office at work or even the 14th-floor lactation room in the company's building, to prostrate and say her afternoon prayers. For her, these prayers strike a balance between secular worries -- ''bills, deadlines, missing the latest episode of 'Lost' ''-- and her sense of purpose and tradition. They are ''also a welcome breather.'' 
 All this makes sense, but when she writes that it ''may seem like an ordeal,'' you know that she is giving a special Marie Claire meaning to that word.
 Then there is the Catholic, or ''recovering Catholic,'' as your fashion magazine knows is the fashionable term. Her hardest struggle, it appears, was initially with guilt over the sex she was enjoying during a semester abroad and then, years later, with a souring new marriage.
 Because her youthful guilt was obviously the pope's fault, she can retail some hoary anti-Catholic images: John Paul II ''wrapping his infallible frame in a cashmere blanket'' and ''laying his head on a gilt-trimmed pillow,'' all at the expense of hard-working parishioners back home ''who turned over a chunk of their weekly take-home to ensure that J. P. II could maintain the lifestyle to which he'd grown accustomed.''
 The bargain therapy comes when the disconsolate newlywed wanders into a Mass and discovers, can you believe this, a priest who sounds humane. Gratitude puts her ''in the market for a new place to worship'' but does not preclude an obligatory crack about pedophilia. 
 What ties these stories together, Jillian, is not struggling through hard times. It is a much better theme for a fashion magazine, the story of each author's exercise of choice, of how she rejects one religious outlook for another or makes it clear that when traditional ties are maintained they won't stand in the way of being a modern ''career gal.'' 
 O.K., no one expects Marie Claire to publish Augustine. One young woman does mention him, though not his ''Confessions'' or its motif that ''you have made us for yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.'' After all, that was the story not of choice but of the slow, difficult recognition of having been chosen -- a recognition that demands a changed life. 
 Sorry to turn serious, Jillian. But thanks very much for your press release. That was a great article on ''When White-Collar Hubbies Go to Jail.''
 Yours truly.

HEADLINE: Protecting Your Job While Coping With a Chronic Illness

BYLINE: By LESLEY ALDERMAN

 BODY:
IT started with an odd sensation in her right hand and a feeling of exhaustion so profound she could hardly get through an hour of work, let alone a full day.
 After numerous tests and countless doctors' visits, Natasha Frechette, then 27, learned she had multiple sclerosis, a disease that attacks the central nervous system and can cause numbness, blindness and eventual paralysis.
 In addition to grappling with the diagnosis, Ms. Frechette was concerned about keeping her job as a data manager for a small research organization in Brooklyn Park, Minn. ''I didn't want to have to depend on someone to take care of me,'' she said. ''But I know that I could wake up tomorrow and not be able to walk.''
 Workers with chronic illnesses face chronic uncertainty, forced to worry not only about their health but about their jobs as well. The protections afforded chronically ill workers in the United States are thin and somewhat vague. To protect their health and their jobs, workers must navigate employers' policies, which may include short- and long-term disability plans, as well as a patchwork of federal laws and regulations. 
 A recent study by the Center for Economics and Policy Research, a Washington research organization, found that among 22 rich nations, the United States was the only one that did not guarantee workers paid time off for illness. 
 Most other countries provide their workers not only with paid sick days, but also time off for cancer treatments, the study found. German citizens, for example, are allowed five sick days and 44 days for cancer treatment, if needed, in addition to vacation days. 
 Most employers in the United States allow employees to take days off for minor ailments, like the flu or outpatient operations, without docking their pay. And 41 percent offer employees days off -- nine, on average -- for illness or other reasons, in addition to vacation days, according to a 2007 survey by Mercer, a benefits consulting business based in New York. 
 But when an employee has a serious or chronic illness, like diabetes, major depression or lupus, the rules about time off become murky. 
 Two laws offer workers some relief. The Family and Medical Leave Act allows employees to take up to 12 weeks off each year for medical or family emergencies -- but without pay. And the Americans With Disabilities Act requires employers to make reasonable adjustments for disabled workers, often in the form of additional time off.
 Ms. Frechette explained her condition to her supervisor and said she would need time off for physical and occupational therapy. Her boss readily agreed, and Ms. Frechette, who plans to marry this fall, continues to work full time.
 ''I'm careful,'' she said. ''I don't want my disease to be seen as a cop-out.''
 If you are dealing with an chronic illness, here are some strategies to help you maintain your job.
 INFORM YOUR EMPLOYER If you have a condition that could interfere with your performance, tell your boss. ''People are often afraid of being discriminated against,'' said Rosalind Joffe, a career coach who counsels people with chronic illnesses. ''I had one client who didn't disclose his illness to anyone. His odd behavior led his boss to conclude he was a drug abuser.'' 
 Be honest. Explain what your condition is and how it might affect your work. ''Don't be ashamed,'' Ms. Frechette said.
 A supervisor who understands what is wrong is less likely to make false assumptions about what you can and cannot do. ''Be clear about your value and what you can deliver,'' Ms. Joffe said. ''If you're a valued employee, your boss will work with you.'' 
 If you feel you are being unfairly treated, speak with your supervisor. If that doesn't work, go to the human resources department.
 ASK FOR ADJUSTMENTS If your illness meets the definition of a disability, your employer is required to make reasonable accommodations to your job or work environment, according to the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
 What is a disability? ''It's a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,'' said Chris Kuczynski, director of the division that deals with the disability act at the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
 Although your illness may be episodic or controlled by medications, it is still a disability, according to a recent amendment to the law. 
 Your employer does not have to provide an accommodation if it would impose significant difficulty or expense. Asking for a car and driver to take you to and from work would probably not be reasonable, Mr. Kuczynski said. But taking time off for chemotherapy treatments certainly would.
 According to the Society for Human Resource Managers, the top five accommodations for the disability act provided by employers in 2005 (the last year for which data are available) were parking or transportation modifications, making existing facilities accessible, offering new equipment to workers, restructuring jobs and modifying the work environment.
 If you are not sure what type of accommodations you are entitled to or how to ask for them, contact the Job Accommodation Network (800-526-7234), a service provided by the federal Department of Labor. In general, the network recommends that you put your request to your employer in writing. If you work in a small, informal setting, that may not be necessary. 
 KNOW THE TIME-OFF POLICIES You can learn about the on-the-books rules by going to your company's intranet or speaking with its human resources department. 
 If you need to take a few weeks or months off for an operation, for example, or chemotherapy, research your company's short- and long-term disability plans. Disability policies typically allow you to take a specific time off at reduced pay. According to Mercer, the consulting firm, 78 percent of employers offer short-term plans and 80 percent offer long-term disability plans. 
 You can also tap into your 12 weeks of family and medical leave at any time. You may take the time intermittently or all at once. You will not be paid, but your job will be secure.
 EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES If the hours are too long or the work is too taxing to handle while you are ill, find out whether you could work part time or could even take a different job in your company. 
 If neither is feasible, explore new career possibilities. One of Ms. Joffe's clients was a high-powered lawyer who had a serious heart condition. To reduce stress, he decided to give up litigation and become a teacher. 
 If you are worried about your finances or health insurance, be sure to check with the advocacy organization focused on your disease. The American Cancer Society, for instance, has a call center (800-227-2345) that helps people who don't have health insurance or are on the verge of losing it. 
 If your illness finally prohibits you from working altogether, you may apply for Social Security disability insurance. The process is lengthy, and you must be able to prove that you cannot work at any job. The amount you are paid is based on your lifetime earnings -- you can find the number on the annual statement you receive from the Social Security Administration. 
 Generally, payments are modest: the average in 2008 was $1,063 a month. But once you have received disability payments for two years, you automatically qualify for Medicare coverage.

HEADLINE: Doors Close At Elite Club Atop the Rock

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When Joel Stein, a writer for Time magazine, first started going to the buffet breakfast at the Rockefeller Center Club in 1997, he and a friend thought they should find some use for the pads of paper and pencils the club put out at the place settings. ''So we would write down big numbers and just pass them back and forth,'' recalls Mr. Stein, who was then 27.
 The club, in the Rainbow Room atop 30 Rockefeller Plaza, had until its last day on Friday that kind of high-roller feel. At breakfast, Mr. Stein might sit a few tables from Richard Parsons, the former Time Warner chairman; the Washington power lawyer Vernon E. Jordan Jr.; or George E. Pataki, the former governor. And at lunch, he could run across David Rockefeller Jr. at the buffet table. Executives from Lazard, which has offices in the building, were regulars, as were a number of managers from NBC. Various prominent financiers got together and talked shop at the club. They included Robert Hormats, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, and Andrew Zacks, considered, among his colleagues, a prophet of doom. 
 ''After a conversation with him, you want to jump out the window,'' said Gary Hindes, a banker who was at some of those meals. ''So depressing.''
 The Cipriani family, the official operator of the storied restaurant until June 30, has butted heads over back rent and rent increases with the landlord, Tishman Speyer, and apparently was not prepared to wait out the bad economy. On June 5, the Rainbow Room was open to the public as a glittering nightclub for the last time. 
 On Friday, the Rockefeller Center Club, a less familiar but equally historical scene, served its last jumbo shrimp, tuna tartare and tiramisu.
 There will be a few events at the restaurant this weekend, and then the Rainbow Room will close its doors, and the club, open since 1934, will cease to exist. Around 300 employees will find themselves looking for work, many of the club's nearly 1,000 members (most of whom paid $2,000 in annual fees) will scatter to various dining clubs around the city, none of which, it must be said, have those famously sweeping views of Manhattan, or could possibly be quite so gloriously stuffy. 
 Lauren Zalaznick, president of NBC Universal Women & Lifestyle Entertainment Networks, tried to squeeze in as many meals at the club as she could this week. She said she always found ''the combination of faded elegance and hard-charging capitalism energizing and enervating, all at the same time.''
 Like a once-radiant movie star who slowly loses her celebrity before quietly retiring, the Rainbow Room pretty much came to an end, or at least prepared for a long pause, on Friday, with hardly any pomp or circumstance. No Champagne-all-around or teary public toasts, just the usual polite shuffling around the buffet table and quiet clinkings of forks, with a few additional goodbyes, some flowers and wrapped gifts for Miriam Mueller, the general manager of the club for the past 10 years.
 JILL SPALDING, a writer and radio host who was impeccably dressed and sitting at a table for two, paused a minute to share some of her own Rainbow Room history. She recalled the coming-out party of a friend (whom she remembered as Pebbles Rockefeller) at the Rainbow Room around 1960. ''She said she'd only have it there if she could do it her own way,'' she recalled. That apparently meant serving the sherbet first and the soup last. ''Our parents were all appalled,'' said Ms. Spalding. 
 Such is subversion at the Rainbow Room. Management has changed there before, but the chandelier and the revolving dance floor have so far endured. Even without the official landmark status the Ciprianis sought, the Rainbow Room has kept, until now, many of the relics of its earlier glamour. 
 Even six months ago, it might have sounded sacrilegious to suggest dramatic changes to those fixtures, but the next tenant -- as yet unknown, although Wolfgang Puck has checked it out -- might well be justified in overhauling the space. Change is in the air; hard-charging capitalism itself now has a faded elegance. The Rainbow Room, like the market that the club's members consider their other playground, is primed for reinvention.
 One of the waiters, who had bigger problems than trying to figure out where to impress his next client, said he would take a break before starting the job search. He said he hoped to find himself back at the same spot under new management, in better times. ''We'll all see each other again,'' he said. ''But who knows when?''

HEADLINE: Perfumers Breathe In Sales Data, and Strategize

BYLINE: By CHANDLER BURR

 BODY:
Long after most other consumer goods companies were getting detailed reports on how their products were selling, giant perfume makers like Estee Lauder, l'Oreal and Coty operated mostly by intuition.
 While they might know that orders from a retailer were down, they could not track what was selling and what was not. They did not know who was buying what perfume.
 That changed in 1996, when Karyn Schoenbart, an executive of the NPD Group, a market research firm, visited the chief executive of an international scent brand and offered to sell him retail data on his perfumes -- and on all his competitors' as well. And they would buy data on his perfumes. 
 ''This,'' Ms. Schoenbart said, ''is when he said, 'You're going to sell us what? How can you do that?' And then, 'Is this legal?' '' 
 It was. And in providing detailed retail data for the first time, NPD revolutionized the management of the huge scent industry. But this may have come at the cost, some argue, of the artistry of perfumery.
 NPD data provides ''a thorough understanding of the marketplace before critical decisions are made,'' said Dennis Keogh, Coty Prestige's senior vice president of marketing in the United States, who manages Jennifer Lopez, Kenneth Cole, Calvin Klein and Vera Wang. ''For years, the industry had no reliable information to go on.'' NPD, he said, ''has totally changed the way we analyze the category and conduct business.'' 
 Mr. Keogh credited NPD's insights with the successful reintroduction of Davidoff's Cool Water, a Coty cornerstone whose success had been eroding after 15 years on the counter. ''The result was all-new advertising, stronger promotional packaging,'' he said, ''making Cool Water less 'gift with purchase' driven.''
 Now, with the economy weak, NPD's figures are even more crucial as the industry navigates rough times. According to NPD, overall prestige fragrance sales in the United States fell 6 percent in 2008. And in the first quarter of this year, retail perfume sales were down 7 percent, said Karen Grant, vice president for beauty at NPD. The perfume industry's annual sales today are $25 billion to $30 billion.
 The declining sales have hit all the major perfume brands and may be even worse than the retail numbers show. One perfume company executive, who spoke anonymously to avoid hurting his business, said he believed that the sales figures were even worse than reported -- down 15 to 20 percent -- because distributors were sending inventory to retailers without buying more from suppliers. 
 Estee Lauder, the American company that owns or licenses scent brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Tom Ford and Sean John, said fragrance sales fell 20 percent in the last quarter of 2008, which Lauder's chief executive, William P. Lauder, called ''one of the worst holiday seasons in decades.'' 
 The NPD Group (originally called National Purchase Diary) started tracking data in 1967 for Scott Paper Company products. It now tracks 14 industries, including entertainment and consumer technology, through relationships with more than 140,000 stores. 
 Ms. Schoenbart said she realized that the beauty industry was a potential NPD client. Lauder had ''sell in'' data, shipments of perfumes to stores.
 ''But at retail?'' asked Diane Nicholson, president of beauty at NPD. ''They knew nothing, no 'sell through' to the consumer. So our data was the first time the beauty industry could see how things performed at retail. It's connecting them to their consumers.''
 NPD receives its data free from retailers, which, in turn, benefit by getting back, again free, the compiled data from all of NPD's retailer sources. The retailers, including Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Sephora, Dillard's and Saks Fifth Avenue, are able to see how they compare with the overall market and their competitors. 
 NPD covers 97 percent of the prestige fragrance market, and it sells that data to perfume brands and scent producers. 
 Moreover, NPD essentially has no competitors. The Kline Report and Nielsen offer figures, but they are less detailed. Euromonitor International gives broad trend analyses, with data once a year.
 NPD's basic product is known in the industry as ''the list,'' the best sellers listed from No. 1 to 100. The company breaks the list down into components, each with different prices, so clients can pick how much detail they want and at what cost.
 Clients can buy NPD's monthly retail tracking data in a number of packages, Ms. Nicholson said. ''But you could just buy semiannual,'' she said. ''It's very a la carte.''
 One of NPD's significant weaknesses is that it reports data from only high-end department stores, ''and that might not be the only distribution channel you're playing in,'' said Matt Frost, global marketing director of fine fragrance and beauty care at International Flavors and Fragrances. NPD captures no data from Wal-Mart, Victoria's Secret or other mass-market retailers, which, Mr. Frost said, have become major outlets for fine fragrances. 
 Similarly, it has no data on Axe, Bath and Body Works, Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy or Brooks Brothers or on direct sales from companies like Avon and Mary Kaye. 
 This has become a bigger factor as perfume makers change their market strategy. 
 Reaction to NPD is not entirely positive. Some in the perfume industry say ''the list'' has generated relentless pressure to rank in the top 10. That pressure can make a house put less money into the raw materials used in a scent and more into advertising. And the advent of NPD has, perhaps not coincidentally, been accompanied by a rise in the number of perfume introductions. A decade ago, perhaps 100 perfumes were introduced each year. In 2008, there were around 1,000. 
 But with the growing sophistication of the industry and the economic downturn, NPD is trying to position itself as even more indispensable. It has expanded to cover France, Italy, Spain and China and hopes to get into Britain. It has also introduced new products. It now offers ''topicals,'' one-time consumer reports costing $10,000 to $25,000 on, for example, a specific perfume that clients like l'Oreal or Coty might buy.
 Fragrance Track, market research reports based on American consumer responses.
 ''Say Chanel wants to know about consumer attitudes towards No. 5, or Lauder and Coty want to know about, respectively, Sean John and Sarah Jessica Parker,'' Ms. Nicholson said. ''We ask consumers where, how and why they bought.''
 Ms. Nicholson said 75 percent of NPD's income in the fragrance industry came from retail tracking and 25 percent from consumer panel tracking.
 At the moment, many perfume makers want to find out not so much what is going wrong but what is going right. NPD's data show, for example, that 46 percent of designer brands were priced over $75 but less than 1 percent of celebrity brands were. And its says that designer perfumes priced over $75 posted an increase of 11 percent in dollars last year, while those priced over $100 rose 28 percent. 
 And in an economy in which the idea of growth seems implausible, NPD's statistics give their clients an interesting counter: though 83 percent of American women wear fragrance, only 36 percent say they wear it every day. The lesson for perfume executives? Do not chase first-time perfume buyers. Instead, try to turn the 62 million occasional wearers into everyday users.

 CORRECTION:
An article on June 20 about the fragrance industry's use of detailed sales data from the NPD Group misspelled part of the name of one company on which NPD does not collect data. It is Mary Kay, not Kaye.

HEADLINE: Treaty to Strengthen the European Union Gets Another Chance

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
After two days of tough talks, leaders of the European Union said Friday that they had agreed on an overhaul of the European system of financial supervision and rekindled prospects that a treaty to strengthen the union will come into force this year. 
 The pact, known as the Lisbon Treaty, seeks to alter the bloc's political institutions to bolster its global role, but it was rejected by Irish voters last June. Leaders meeting in Brussels said Friday that they had agreed on the legally binding guarantees Ireland said it needed to hold a new referendum, which is expected to have a greater chance of approving the treaty, given the economic crisis.
 Brian Cowen, the Irish prime minister, said the new vote would take place in early October, and the declaration issued Friday at the end of the European summit meeting predicted that the Lisbon pact would enter into force ''by the end of 2009.''
 Ratification of the treaty by all the European Union countries is required for it to become law, so the Irish rejection stopped the treaty in its tracks. If the Irish can be persuaded to vote ''yes'' and the union's current president, Vaclav Klaus of the Czech Republic -- a critic of the treaty -- can be persuaded to sign the document, an eight-year struggle to overhaul the union's institutions will come to fruition. 
 The Lisbon Treaty is intended to streamline decision making, create a permanent president of the European Union Council, where member states meet, and upgrade the job of the bloc's chief of foreign policy.
 At the root of the drive for change is an effort to overcome the disunity often seen as undermining the effectiveness of a bloc of 27 nations that often have competing interests. 
 Also at the meeting, Britain dropped its reservations and signed up for the union's most ambitious plan yet for financial regulation, after winning concessions that the new European supervisors would not be able to force nations to spend money bailing out institutions if they opposed doing so. 
 Britain had worried that with its large financial center in London, it might face more demands on its taxpayers, though the government had already pursued aggressive efforts to shore up ailing financial institutions and stimulate its economy.
 Like the United States, the Europeans want to overhaul regulation to avoid a repeat of the mistakes that led to the banking crisis last year. Though the union's plans are less ambitious than those of the United States, the president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, said they underlined a shift in attitudes.
 ''It's a starting point and, in my view, there will be an evolution,'' Mr. Sarkozy said, suggesting that the system would gain expanded powers.
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain said that stronger cross-border supervision was in his country's interests, adding that ''U.K. taxpayers will be protected.''
 Much of the two-day meeting was devoted to drafting the legal assurances demanded by Ireland to stage another Lisbon referendum. These guarantees state that the treaty will not affect Ireland's traditional military neutrality, its right to set its own taxes or its ability to determine policies on ethical issues like abortion.

HEADLINE: Hawaii Blues

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE DOWNES

 BODY:
The state of Hawaii turns 50 this year (it joined the union on Aug. 21, 1959). People there should be happy. But it's hard. 
 The economy is really bad. The housing market and construction industry are in deep slumps. Tourism has been hammered by the recession and swine flu. Unemployment is double what it was a year ago. To close a $688 million budget gap, the governor announced the most drastic furlough program in the country. She's closing state offices three days a month, for two years. Aloha Friday, where people go to work in aloha shirts and muumuus, is going to be Furlough Friday, where they stay home in pajamas and look for jobs on the Internet. 
 And now, to top everything off, a communist dictator supposedly wants to blow up Hawaii. A Japanese newspaper, The Yomiuri Shimbun, reported this week that North Korea planned to launch a ballistic missile in Hawaii's direction around the Fourth of July.
 You can take the threat for what it's worth. Hawaii isn't panicking. But then, while no one wants to think of extinction, the word is far less of an abstraction in Hawaii than in other places. The islands have seen the disappearance of the Hawaiian kingdom, the decimation of its people and language. Today, Hawaii is the world's hottest hot spot for threatened and endangered species. As the only island state, it's the only one that faces an existential threat from global warming and rising oceans. 
 For years, financially squeezed Hawaii residents have been leaving in droves, setting up colonies in places they can afford, like the moonscapes of the Las Vegas suburbs. They're exiles from paradise. Many people assume Hawaiian music is sweet and happy. Actually, much of it is solemn and melancholy. To hear Bla Pahinui sing his version of ''Waimanalo Blues'' -- ''the beaches they sell, to build their hotels,'' is to glimpse the depths of the Hawaiian sense of loss.
 Visitors go to Hawaii to get happy and tan, and they carry home with them vast measures of good will, serenity and memories of joy and peace. Maybe it's time to give some of that back to the suffering 50th state. How? Maybe by telling your representatives in Congress to support the Akaka bill, to give Native Hawaiians a measure of lost sovereignty, and right some old injustices.
 There's a great July Fourth parade in Kailua, on Oahu's windward side. It's normally followed by fireworks, but they were canceled this year: too expensive. Some residents are trying to raise money to keep the tradition alive. Since 1948, people have sat on the warm sands of Kailua Beach, oohing and aahing as fireworks burst over black water. Now they can't, in their state's golden anniversary year. Could anything be sadder than that?

HEADLINE: Taking Sides in the Cupcake Wars

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Mother's Fight Against Junk Food Puts a School on Edge,'' by Susan Dominus (Big City column, June 16):
 As a pediatrician and a child weight loss specialist, I am conflicted about this article. MeMe Roth, the mother ''driven mad'' by junk food, may not use the best tactics, but her point is right. We are in the midst of a child obesity epidemic. One out of every three children in our country is either overweight or obese. Our schools should be a safe haven for our children.
 I have overweight children crying in my office on a daily basis because they are trying to eat well but are confronted with temptations at school. I do believe in all foods in moderation. But our children have plenty of exposure to unhealthy foods outside of school. 
 In a typical classroom of 26 children, there are up to 26 days of birthday cupcakes to contend with. Then you add in celebrations for holidays, and many classes have a party every week. There are many healthy birthday options, and we can use them to celebrate our children's birthdays without sacrificing their health.
 Joanna Dolgoff New York, June 16, 2009
 To the Editor:
 As a former trainee schoolteacher before switching to education research, I am saddened by MeMe Roth's militancy on obesity, and especially so in elementary classrooms. 
 During my two years in the classroom I had worse things to deal with than trying to completely eliminate junk foods.
 The best pedagogy I found was to model well and suggest alternatives to children who bring ''bad choices.'' But to ban sugary food even for a child's birthday or other class celebration is a waste of valuable time. The focus should be on: yes, you can enjoy yourself, but in moderation.
 Simply put, serve as an example to students and give them choices, and you make it ''cool'' for children to eat healthy. The high school in my hometown (Taita College, Lower Hutt, New Zealand), and I am sure many others, have done this successfully. 
 Jonathan Ah Kit Erie, Pa., June 17, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I was mildly horrified when I read about MeMe Roth's emphatic belief in avoiding everything less virtuous than okra or spinach. 
 While I certainly believe a healthy diet is essential for children, I also believe that instilling them with such an incredible fear and suspicion of sugary treats can do just as much damage as the occasional cupcake.
 When I was in the hospital recovering from an eating disorder, patients were repeatedly told that no food is a ''bad'' food, and that a balanced diet, including chocolate and baked goods every once in a while, is a healthy and happy medium.
 Espousing a strict avoidance of junk food seems only to heighten its allure for children. It seems much more sensible to encourage fruits, vegetables and other healthy food every day, and allow a doughnut or ice cream cone on special occasions.
 Tova Ross Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. June 16, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Fresher Food, With Some Help'' (Business Day, June 17):
 Gov. David A. Paterson's effort to bring fresh-food stores to low-income communities is a boon for the health and economies of neighborhoods that need boosts in both. 
 By trying to replicate the astounding success of the Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Initiative -- which has already provided nearly 400,000 Pennsylvanians with better access to healthy food -- New York is at the leading edge of a national wave to bring healthy food and jobs to communities that were abandoned decades ago by the well-stocked supermarkets most Americans take for granted.
 That is why my organization is working in partnership with the leaders of these state efforts -- the Food Trust and the Reinvestment Fund -- to bring this smart, innovative idea to a national scale. Using the leadership and leverage of the federal government, we can make a real impact on the health and welfare of millions of residents of low-income communities and communities of color.

HEADLINE: Cashmere Makers Feel a Chill

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HOHHOT, China 

 BODY:
This summer, as always, the cashmere on offer in department stores and malls is mostly in ultrathin ''summer weight'' tops. Come fall, these usually are replaced by thick, luxuriant sweaters. But this year is shaping up to be different.
 Merchants in China say that American and European orders for the holiday season, for which sweaters are just starting to be knit, have fallen by as much as 30 percent. And the garments chosen by buyers from Western stores are noticeably skimpy, using less of the costly material. 
 ''They are too small -- half the breast is outside the sweater,'' complained Wang Jie, the sales manager of the Inner Mongolia Dongda Cashmere Products Company Ltd.
 Western consumers are buying fewer luxury goods, and demand for cashmere has plunged. The painful effects of this are being felt all the way to these nearly empty plateaus of Inner Mongolia, by goatherds and factory workers and owners -- showing how ripples from markets in the United States, Europe and Japan can reverberate to some of the most remote corners of the world.
 Nicknamed the ''diamond fiber'' in Inner Mongolia, cashmere has changed the life of Yrthashun, a herder who like many ethnic Mongolians has only one name. He lives in the tiny village of Baiyuanhua, a four-hour drive north of Hohhot on a two-lane, paved road that traverses a vast flatness, where close-cropped grass and areas of dirt stretch beneath an immense sky.
 As affluence spread worldwide in the 1990s, the middle classes began to wear cashmere and Mr. Yrthashun grew prosperous. As recently as a year ago, the cashmere combed from his flock of 100 thigh-high Kashmir goats sold for as much as $27.50 a pound, allowing Mr. Yrthashun to buy a compact Chinese car. 
 But the price of cashmere has fallen by almost half since then and herders have been forced to sell many of their goats for meat. 
 ''The end to goat herding after centuries is the most sorrowful thing I have ever had to face,'' Mr. Yrthashun said.
 The problem is not just the collapse of the cashmere market, but also a government ban on Kashmir goats across much of Inner Mongolia for environmental reasons. Hungry goats with sharp hooves have denuded arid plateaus and broken up the soil, contributing to dust storms that fill the sky in Beijing and other cities in northeastern China.
 Yarn factories, which take cloud-soft wool from the goats and spin it for the sweater factories' looms, are suffering too. The Tiaje Cashmere Company's factory here, a windowless hall the size of a football field, is filled with rows of machines that transform wool into yarn. But because business has shrunk, in recent months only a handful of workers have labored in small pools of light in an otherwise dark expanse of shadowed machinery.
 ''I wish more of the lights were on; it's a bit dark,'' said Lin Siuchi, a soft-spoken 38-year-old, adjusting several spools of downy white cashmere being twisted into yarn. 
 ''I'm not afraid to be here alone,'' she said, ''but I would be happier if there were more people here with me.''
 The Tiaje Cashmere Company sells yarn to the nearby Inner Mongolia Harmony Industry and Trade Company, which knits beautifully textured sweaters and other cashmere garments for the American and Italian markets.
 But the factory has been operating at less than half of capacity for much of the last year. Employment at the factory fell to 50 early this year. Muren, the owner and general manager, who also has only one name, said that employment had since recovered to 70 -- but this is supposed to be the annual surge of production, from June to September, to accommodate the autumn retailing season in the West.
 Inner Mongolia Harmony has orders for 20,000 sweaters so far this year, compared with 28,000 at this time last year. And Mr. Muren differs with some economists, saying that he sees little sign of a nascent recovery in the United States.
 ''Our American and European customers say the situation is terrible,'' he said.
 Da Lisu, the merchandise manager of the rival Inner Mongolia Saihan Cashmere Products Company, said some cashmere companies had failed in recent months. One mistake by the failed companies was to ship sweaters to American customers on promises that they would be paid later, Ms. Da said.
 ''I've had friends at companies that have gone bankrupt because U.S. buyers have reneged on payments,'' said Ms. Da, who added that she did not know the identity of these American buyers.
 Her company demands payment in advance and has not had problems, she said, and it is following that policy with particular attention now. ''We all have to be much more cautious,'' she said.
 Mr. Wang said that American buyers facing slower sales had become much quicker to reject shipments by complaining that the garments did not precisely match the original specifications.
 ''Our sizes are very accurate -- now they say, 'You made a mistake,' '' he said.
 Complaints about the accuracy of designs are often followed by demands from buyers for further deep price reductions. ''They say, 'please give me a discount and I can sell it anyway,' '' Mr. Wang said, folding the fingers of his left hand in the shape of a gun and pretending to shoot such buyers.
 As China tries to make up for falling exports of all sorts, many export industries are trying to sell more to the domestic market. But garments designed for American customers frequently cannot be marketed in China, and demand in China is still weak for luxuries like cashmere sweaters.
 Indeed, the speed of the economic downturn last autumn left Inner Mongolia Dongda with 2,000 unsold sweaters made for Americans. Now they are piled in a warehouse.
 In China, Mr. Wang said, ''we can only sell the 'S' size.''
 But Mr. Muren sees one small sign of hope in Inner Mongolia: the global recovery in commodities prices is starting to reach cashmere, as companies have started stockpiling raw cashmere again in anticipation of eventual better times, pushing up the price by 3 to 5 percent in the last several weeks.
 ''Some people are collecting the cashmere even though they do not have orders,'' he said, ''because they think, and I also think, that this is the bottom price.''

HEADLINE: Disaster Request for a Drought-Hit County in California

BYLINE: By SOLOMON MOORE

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger made an unusual request Friday, asking President Obama to declare Fresno County a federal disaster area because of a three-year drought that is straining California's agricultural industry and worsening unemployment in the hard-hit Central Valley.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, announced his request on a visit to the county, the state's breadbasket, where unemployment is near 17 percent. 
 Tough new environmental regulations to protect endangered freshwater fish are also hindering California's huge agricultural industry, which provides about half of the nation's fresh produce. 
 Government statistics released Friday showed California's unemployment rate at 11.5 percent in May, the highest since World War II, compared with 11.1 percent in April, representing a loss of 68,900 nonfarm jobs. 
 Requests for a presidential disaster declaration are rarer for droughts than for other natural disasters. In 2007, the governor of Georgia requested a declaration because of a prolonged drought, but President George W. Bush declined to make one. 
 The White House did not respond immediately to Mr. Schwarzenegger's request.
 Should Mr. Obama grant the request, California would qualify for direct aid, low-interest loans and other resources offered by the federal government. 
 Without the declaration, drought relief is usually handled through the Department of Agriculture's crop insurance program, which subsidizes underwriters of agricultural concerns and provides direct payments to farmers and ranchers. 
 The governor also signed an executive order to provide about $3 million a month in food assistance and unemployment insurance in the Fresno area.
 ''These are dire circumstances,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said at a stop in Mendota. ''Here in the Central Valley, no water means no work. And no work means people cannot feed their families.'' 
 About 450,000 acres across California are fallow this year because of water shortages, state officials say. Fewer planted acres means fewer jobs in agriculture and higher prices at supermarkets across the country, said Victoria Bradshaw, the governor's deputy chief of staff.
 ''Last month, agriculture lost 29,000 jobs'' in the state, Ms. Bradshaw said. 
 ''That has huge impact not only on California's economy but on the nation's food supply,'' she said. ''If we can't keep our agricultural communities together, then we're going to be more dependent on foreign food supplies.''
 California had only 53 percent of its normal rainfall in 2007, and 58 percent in 2008, and has had only 77 percent this year, said Lester Snow, director of the California Department of Water Resources. Federal and state reservoirs that collect rainwater and melting mountain snowpacks in Northern California remain critically low, Mr. Snow said.
 Also, a recent federal court ruling on the Endangered Species Act requires the water authorities to restrict severely the operation of pumping stations in the San Joaquin River Delta because they were destroying endangered smelt populations. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger's visit to the Central Valley came at the suggestion of Mayor Robert Silva of Mendota, a hard-hit rural town of cantaloupe farms and 10,700 people where unemployment is about 41 percent.
 ''We've been having food giveaways every two weeks,'' Mr. Silva said. ''We had another one yesterday where we gave away 1,200 boxes of produce. The crime rate has gone up because a lot of people around here are desperate, and a lot of people are traveling to other places for work.'' 
 Todd Allen, 46, a wheat and cotton farmer from the Fresno County community of Firebaugh, said he was angry that the government seemed to be more concerned about ''bait fish'' than about his livelihood.
 ''I'll be damned if I'll let a little fish take all my water away,'' Mr. Allen said. ''I will sue for everything and make sure that I get a bunch of farmers together and people who have lost jobs to fight the government to the end.''
 Most of Mr. Allen's 600 acres are a tangle of dead wheat stalks and weeds because he lacked enough water to irrigate his crops. And his finances are a jumble of bank debts, he said, adding that he had begun taking pills for high blood pressure.
 ''I've been out there weeding it myself because I can't afford any employees,'' Mr. Allen said. ''It's going to be a disaster in the supermarkets when people have to pay $4 for a cantaloupe. You got people sleeping in cars out here. I've seen people getting turned away from food lines.''

HEADLINE: We Don't Need the F-22

 BODY:
You would think that with all the legitimate and expensive claims on the government pocketbook -- including two wars, an economic crisis and desperately needed health care reform -- Congress would be extra judicious about how it spends the taxpayers' money. But no, at least not when it comes to the House Armed Services Committee and lucrative defense contracts. 
 The panel has proved again how the insatiable drive to keep fancy weapons systems alive can trump all good sense. With Representative Rob Bishop of Utah and other Republicans leading the charge, and with the support of six Democrats, the committee this week narrowly voted to keep producing the Air Force's F-22 stealth fighter jet. 
 We adamantly opposed Defense Secretary Robert Gates's proposal to buy four more F-22s in next year's budget. But at least he wanted to cap the fleet at 187 planes. The House committee has voted to approve a $369 million down payment on 12 more. If all of those are bought, the total price tag would be about $2.8 billion.
 The Pentagon budget must be more closely attuned to military and economic reality than the misdirected and undisciplined spending of the last eight years. Mr. Gates has made a compelling case for ending programs that significantly exceed their budgets or use limited tax dollars to buy ''more capability than the nation needs.'' 
 No weapons system fits that criteria better than the F-22. It is a cold war relic, designed for defense against the Soviet Union. It has never flown in combat, much less in the wars this country is actually fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Air Force's new high-performance F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which begins production in 2012, uses stealth technology to elude enemy radar like the F-22, and should be sufficient.
 Lockheed Martin and its partners parceled out work on the plane widely to ensure maximum political protection. And we deeply regret that jobs will be lost by phasing out the F-22. But the United States cannot keep paying for redundant and dubious systems. There are too many other compelling demands on the country's battered budget -- some of which will certainly create new jobs. It is up to House Democratic leaders to make this case to their members and ensure that the committee's decision on the F-22 is overturned.

HEADLINE: Seeking a Sea Change in Europe, a Green Coalition Gathers Strength

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Jeanette Coombs contributed reporting from Paris.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
One of the real victors in this month's elections for the European Parliament is a 64-year-old former radical, an ebullient Franco-German who has turned his efforts to transform society from revolution to ecology. 
 During the student uprisings of May 1968, the Franco-German, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, was known as Danny the Red, but now he is Danny the Green, and he has directed and ridden the suddenly fashionable political wave of environmentalism into considerable influence. 
 Behind his articulate, vivid presence and sense of fun, Mr. Cohn-Bendit's Europe Ecologie coalition of European Green parties came in third in French voting for the Parliament, winning 16.28 percent of the vote. It was just behind the squabbling Socialists, who had only 16.48 percent, and ahead of a presumptive presidential candidate, Francois Bayrou of the centrist Democratic Movement, or Modem. 
 The European Parliament is the only directly elected institution of the European Union, and voting took place in all 27 member states. One reason for the coalition's success, Mr. Cohn-Bendit said in an interview in his Brussels office, is that it concentrated on European issues and the idea of a better future, instead of turning the vote into a referendum on the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. There was also an element of collaborative fun and joy, he said, evident in the coalition's campaign videos, which were viewed thousands of times on the Internet. 
 ''We said that on the European level, we can deal with the crises that confront us,'' he said. ''We have a project for Europe, an idea -- the ecological transformation of our way of production and way of life, with a social shield to protect the people who are negatively affected by the process of transformation.'' 
 The Green parties want to defend the future of everyone, he said. ''It's not for the privileged,'' Mr. Cohn-Bendit said. ''It's for the survival of mankind.'' If Mr. Sarkozy campaigned on the idea of working more to earn more, Mr. Cohn-Bendit said, the Green coalition urged, ''Work differently for a better life.''
 More than that, he said, the coalition was ''the only group who had fun in the campaign.'' President Obama ''won by trying to redefine the American dream, and we have to redefine the European dream,'' he said. 
 ''Obama won because he gave hope to people, and we want Europe to give hope to people,'' Mr. Cohn-Bendit said. 
 So far in this economic crisis, Europe has given little hope, said Mr. Cohn-Bendit, who is the only person to have been elected to the European Parliament from both Germany and France. ''The problem is that Europe reacted nationally,'' he said. ''They didn't get the momentum necessary to give a coordinated, European answer.''
 The lack of an answer is what doomed the Socialists all over Europe in this election, he said. The Socialist narrative and its ideology are outdated, he said, ''not fit for modern society.'' And in general, but especially in France, Socialist leaders are perceived to be ''completely out of touch,'' while they squabble for personal position and the presidential candidacy three years from now, he said. 
 ''It's become too personalized,'' he said, ''so it's not a collective productive effort.'' In the competition of personalities, he said, ''you can't beat Nicolas Sarkozy.'' Rather, Mr. Cohn-Bendit said, ''You've got to have an alternative project'' -- a positive new model for society around which voters can gather. 
 In this election, in which the French turnout was roughly half that of the 2007 presidential race, the Ecologists attracted a number of Socialist voters who did not turn to Mr. Bayrou. Jerome Fourquet, of Ifop, the French Institute of Public Opinion, said some voters who helped the Socialists win municipal elections in March 2008 turned to the Ecology coalition. ''These are precisely the middle-class voters that the Socialist Party could not attract that Europe Ecologie steered away from Modem,'' Mr. Fourquet said.
 Marc-Olivier Padis, editor in chief of the monthly magazine Esprit, said the election ''shows that a part of the electorate is hesitating -- the center-left, which was disappointed by Segolene Royal and was able to vote for Bayrou in the presidential election, was disappointed this time by Bayrou,'' he said, referring to another former Socialist presidential candidate. ''If there is a center in France,'' he said, ''it is about Europe.''
 The Socialist leader, Martine Aubry, called the vote ''an important electoral defeat'' and said the party had ''six months to change course.'' Her plan is to bring together a ''sages council'' of other Socialist leaders -- nearly all of them her bitter rivals. 
 The magazine Marianne commented, ''The Socialist Party needs to undergo shock therapy, and Martine Aubry proposes six months of chamomile.'' As for the ''sages,'' the magazine said, ''Given the affection they feel for each other, metal detectors will need to be installed at the entrance.''
 Mr. Sarkozy, meanwhile, did very well, winning 27.87 percent of the vote. Despite low popularity ratings, he consolidated the center-right and became the first French president since 1979 to lead his party to victory in a European Parliament election.
 His victory was echoed elsewhere, as center-right parties like the Christian Democrats, led in Germany by Chancellor Angela Merkel, did well throughout the Continent. 
 After these elections, Mr. Sarkozy is preparing to start the second phase of his presidency with a speech on Monday and a reshuffle of his cabinet. He is expected to keep the prime minister, Francois Fillon, and the foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner. But he is likely to shift ministers in the areas of justice, agriculture, education and the environment, while trying to keep lines open to the Socialists and to immigrants.
 Mr. Sarkozy is already moving to try to attract the environmental vote. ''What is fascinating about Sarkozy is the rapidity with which he can react,'' Mr. Cohn-Bendit said. ''There's a Green vote on Sunday, and on Monday he makes a big proposal on renewable energy, etc. He doesn't stop. He says, 'O.K., society wants it, I'll go in this direction.' ''
 On Thursday, Mr. Sarkozy invited Mr. Cohn-Bendit; Cecile Duflot, the head of the French Greens; and Pascal Durand, an adviser to a well-known environmentalist and likely Green coalition presidential candidate, Nicolas Hulot, to the Elysee Palace. ''Sarkozy realized there was a green wave in France,'' Mr. Cohn-Bendit said afterward, ''and he wants to surf it.''
 Mr. Sarkozy is now discussing an idea to create a global organization for the environment with the Brazilian president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
 The next challenge for Mr. Cohn-Bendit and his coalition will be the French regional elections next March. The Greens intend to run in the first round of voting, to gauge their strength, and then go into coalitions with others, probably the Socialists. ''But you have to think regional, the way we thought European,'' Mr. Cohn-Bendit said.

HEADLINE: The Myth of the $12 Million Uighur

BYLINE: By STUART BECK. 
Stuart Beck is Palau's permanent representative to the United Nations.

 BODY:
CONGRATULATIONS Palau. Our little country, a group of islands 500 miles east of the Philippines, has become, if only briefly, a household word. President Obama, much admired in Palau, asked our new president, Johnson Toribiong, to do the United States a favor: Please accept, as refugees, a group of innocent Chinese Muslims. They are not anti-American terrorists, but victims of human rights violations, who landed at Guantanamo Bay for seven years. Innocent, stateless, harmless.
 President Toribiong, a lawyer trained at the University of Washington and a highly regarded litigator, told President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that he needed to assure his people that the Uighurs were indeed harmless, and could be integrated into Palau's small, diverse and friendly culture. Assuming that this due diligence brought satisfactory results, Palau would be pleased to give the refugees temporary residence. Last weekend, he dispatched a number of officials to Guantanamo to interview the Uighurs and review their records. 
 One would have thought that this positive gesture of friendship from a staunch American ally would have been applauded, at least in the United States. Instead, for reasons that are beyond me, unattributed leaks and unsubstantiated rumors have twisted Palau's act of decency into another grab for dollars by a cunning third-world country. In breaking the story that Palau was amenable to President Obama's request, the Associated Press reported that two anonymous State Department officials had linked Palau's acceptance of the Uighurs to a $200 million payoff.
 Almost immediately, much of the news media took the bait, did the math and asserted that Palau was getting nearly $12 million dollars per Uighur. Within a day or two, The Wall Street Journal was pontificating against a shakedown. 
 Before the story gets too far out of hand, let's consider a few facts. It is true that the United States and Palau have an economic relationship. Palau has been receiving American aid since it was wrested from the Japanese in 1944. (Over the past 15 years, this has averaged about $56 million a year.) This aid has come with strings; as the United States has always insisted that the Palauan government be ready to promptly turn over land for bases should the security of the United States or Palau require it. 
 In 1994, the two countries agreed to a 50-year option that allows the United States to use Palau for military purposes. That agreement's economic terms expire in October 2009, and a new economic package for the remaining 35 years is in the works -- and has been for some time. But there has never been a mention of $200 million. And no one has even hinted at linking the deal to Palau's acceptance of the Uighurs. The United States simply offered to pay relocation costs for the Uighurs of less than $90,000 per person to cover transportation, food, housing and medical help until the men can get oriented and get jobs.
 Palau is a small and peaceful community. Its constitution bans weapons of all kinds. Capital crimes are virtually unknown. Social life revolves around the family. Children wander from house to house. Could anyone believe that the leaders of Palau would risk the safety and serenity of their modern Eden in exchange for money? Is it plausible that these close-knit people would countenance the presence of terrorists in their midst? I can assure you the answer is no.
 Last week, the Palauans lowered their flags to half-staff in memory of Sgt. Jasper Obakrairur, a Palauan who joined the United States Marines and died on June 1 helping to root out the Taliban in Afghanistan. He was the fourth Palauan serviceman to die in recent years, following his fallen comrades in American uniform Cpl. JayGee Meluat, Cpl. Meresebang Ngiraked and Specialist Philton Ueki. The people of Palau are very proud of them, and of our country's special relationship with the United States. Can't Americans be proud of the relationship, too?

HEADLINE: A Do-Gooder With a Potential Image Problem

BYLINE: By DEVIN LEONARD

 BODY:
BACK in August 2007 Charlie Corwin pitched an unusual idea for a television show to Ben Silverman, the recently appointed co-chairman of NBC Entertainment, over dinner at the Chateau Marmont, the decadent celebrity refuge in Hollywood. 
 Mr. Corwin is known for producing reality shows about tattoo artists (''L.A. Ink'' on TLC), celebrity stylists (''The Rachel Zoe Project'' on Bravo) and scientists crazy enough to film the insides of tornados (''Storm Chasers'' on the Discovery Channel). But now he had something entirely different in mind. 
 Mr. Corwin wondered if NBC would be interested in a scripted series about a billionaire chief executive called ''The Philanthropist,'' inspired by his friend Bobby Sager, who had made piles of money investing in distressed companies and now spent much of his time jetting off to dangerous places like Rwanda and Pakistan to do charitable work. The show would revolve around a ruthless, philandering chief executive named Teddy Rist, who, after the death of his young son, decides to use his talents, connections and sharp elbows in the name of righteous causes like bringing clean water to Kashmir, fighting starvation in Haiti and aiding sweatshop workers in Myanmar. 
 It must have been quite a pitch. Mr. Corwin had never done scripted television before. Nevertheless Mr. Silverman green-lighted ''The Philanthropist'' without waiting to see a pilot. Now Mr. Corwin, 36, said he hopes ''The Philanthropist,'' which makes it debut on Wednesday at 10 p.m., will deliver the ratings it needs to survive. 
 That may not be easy. Much has changed since he sold the show to NBC. The world is in the midst of the worst economic crisis in decades. People are livid about leaders of public companies who make eight-figure salaries and are pushing thousands of employees out the door. Even the roguish charm of James Purefoy, the British actor who plays Teddy (and who portrayed Mark Antony in ''Rome'' on HBO), may not be enough to counteract the public disdain for chief executives.
 In the pilot Teddy delivers vaccines to sick children in Nigeria. But along the way he flaunts his wealth and power in a manner that would make Gordon Gekko proud. He conspires with a drug dealer to smuggle the serum into the country. He has a midnight romp with four women proffered by the same gentleman. And he escapes from the Drug Enforcement Administration's clutches by giving a malleable agent the chance to fly his Gulfstream. 
 Mr. Sager, the former president of Gordon Brothers, a Boston investment group, said he hoped viewers would be inspired by Teddy's altruism. But he distances himself from his fictional counterpart. ''I said at a screening the other night in Los Angeles: 'This guy isn't me. He is just some guy who wants to be me.' ''
 Bruce Fretts, articles editor of TV Guide, said he wondered if ''The Philanthropist'' might simply be out of step with the times. 
 ''The networks are moving away from conspicuous consumption shows like 'Dirty Sexy Money,' '' Mr. Fretts said, referring to the gaudy ABC drama about the richest family in New York, ''in favor of shows about working people, or like ABC's new Kelsey Grammer sitcom, 'Hank', about a C.E.O. who loses his job and has to move back to his hometown.'' He added that this may be why NBC has chosen to burn off Mr. Corwin's show in the summer. 
 Mr. Silverman said nothing could be further from the truth. He argued that Teddy's transformation from a self-interested capitalist to a freebooting do-gooder fit the new national mood. Still, Mr. Silverman conceded that ''The Philanthropist'' was a risk for the network. ''It's not straight ahead,'' he said. ''You can't just promote it like a cop show.''
 Mr. Corwin insists ''The Philanthropist'' will benefit from the economic turmoil: ''We call it the first Obama drama. This is a show about a character who finds his own salvation in helping other people.''
 ''The Philanthropist'' is a pivotal project for Mr. Corwin, a New York University-trained lawyer who sports a fedora and dresses casually in jeans and flannel shirts. He started producing cable reality shows seven years ago after an Internet music Web site he had created in the late 1990s fell victim to the dot-com bust. ''Reality television was still very young,'' Mr. Corwin said. ''It had lower barriers to entry for a producer like me without a track record.''
 He quickly got one, thanks to shows like ''Miami Ink,'' about South Florida body illustrators and their colorful patrons. He also set out to become a Hollywood player, earning producer or executive producer credits on independent films like ''The Squid and the Whale'' and ''Half Nelson.'' 
 Then, in 2007, Mr. Corwin sold a majority stake in Original Media, his privately held company, to Endemol, the Dutch reality television giant responsible for ''Deal or No Deal.'' He won't say how much he made. But his resume quotes news reports saying the price was close to $50 million. Will he be as successful in the realm of scripted television? Mr. Corwin said that there isn't that big a difference between ''The Philanthropist'' and one of his typical docu-soaps: ''I think what I'm known for is character-driven storytelling. In this particular case Bobby Sager's story needed to have a scripted iteration. He wasn't about to followed around by a camera crew.''
 Mr. Corwin is too busy to worry about whether the public will embrace Teddy Rist. He has two TLC reality shows making debuts this year: ''Masters of Reception,'' about a New Jersey catering hall, and ''The Rock and Roll Florist,'' a behind-the-scenes look at Jeff Leatham, artistic director of the Four Seasons Hotels. And he's working on a new show for NBC with Padma Lakshmi, host of Bravo's ''Top Chef.'' Mr. Corwin won't say much about it, except for this: It is a half-hour comedy. And, yes, there will be actors reading scripts.

HEADLINE: Too Big To Fail, Or Too Big To Handle?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
''No one should assume that the government will step in to bail them out if their firm fails.'' 
 That's Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, talking tough with lawmakers last week as he promoted the government's remake of the financial regulatory framework. 
 Talk is cheap, however. And the notion that the plan shows a new aversion to bailouts is not at all supported by its chapter and verse. In fact, there's precious little in the 88-page document about how the government will eliminate systemic risks posed by financial firms that aren't allowed to fail because they're simply too big or to interconnected to other important economic players here and abroad. 
 Rather than propose ways to shrink these companies and the risks they pose, the Geithner plan argues instead for enhanced regulatory oversight of the behemoths. This suggests the taxpayer safety net will be larger after our national financial train wreck, not smaller. 
 More than two years after the crisis began, ''too big to fail'' remains ''too problematic to address'' with anything other than more souped-up regulation. Given that earlier efforts at policing these entities failed so miserably, why should anyone think that a new-and-improved regulatory approach will fare better? 
 ''The sudden failures of large U.S.-based investment banks and of American International Group were among the most destabilizing events of the financial crisis,'' the Geithner proposal said. ''These companies were large, highly leveraged, and had significant financial connections to the other major players in our financial system, yet they were ineffectively supervised and regulated.''
 All true, of course, with Citigroup -- a bank that Mr. Geithner himself regulated -- being Exhibit A. But the solution the document proposed is ''a new, more robust supervisory regime for any firm whose combination of size, leverage, and interconnectedness could pose a threat to financial stability if it failed.'' 
 Hmmm. Sort of an enhanced status quo, just with a bigger safety net.
 That this taxpayer-supported net will be larger and more encompassing when this mess finally ends comes as no surprise to some people. Last August, Edward J. Kane, a finance professor at Boston College, wrote about just this likelihood in a paper titled ''Ethical Failures in Regulating and Supervising the Pursuit of Safety-Net Subsidies.'' 
 In the paper, Professor Kane described why the policy responses to financial crises historically had involved expanding the universe of companies eligible for taxpayer support if another mess arose.
 ''When a substantial portion of the financial sector appears to be at risk, it is far easier to patch up the weaknesses in the system with ad hoc loans and guarantees than to negotiate genuine reform,'' he wrote. 
 PROFESSOR KANE'S paper certainly is prescient. For top regulators to be able to push through larger bailouts, he argued, two conditions must hold. ''First they must be able to control the flow of information,'' he wrote, ''so as to keep taxpayers and the press from convincingly assessing either the magnitude of the implicit capital transfer or the anti-egalitarian character of the subsidization scheme.'' 
 Sound familiar? Recall the months of secrecy surrounding the bailout of A.I.G.'s counterparties and the refusal of the Federal Reserve Board to disclose how it chose BlackRock to oversee three of its rescue programs and what it was paying the firm to do so? 
 Then there is Professor Kane's second condition: Regulators' commitment to these bailout policies ''must be continually nourished by praise and other forms of tribute from the bankers, borrowers and investors whose losses are being shifted to less-influential parties.'' 
 We've heard a lot of this, of course, in recent weeks. Here is Timothy Ryan, president of the securities industry lobbying group, responding to the Treasury plan on the group's Web site. ''This is an important step forward,'' he said. ''We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rebuild our regulatory structure so that our financial system is more stable, more resilient and better underpins a dynamic U.S. economy.'' 
 To be sure, the Treasury proposal does hope to curb the growth of large, systemically scary companies by raising their costs of doing business. But entrusting greater responsibilities to the same supervisors who missed the risks at the institutions they oversaw during the mania doesn't inspire confidence. 
 And with the exception of merging the Office of Thrift Supervision into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the plan doesn't suggest how the regulators who failed will be held accountable for their mistakes. 
 According to some experts who study systemic risks posed by huge and complex companies, installing a ''more robust supervisory regime'' isn't enough. 
 ''I do not think that intensification of traditional supervision and regulation of large financial firms will effectively address the too-big-to-fail problem,'' Gary H. Stern, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and an authority on resolving big and troubled institutions, said last month in Congressional testimony. 
 Mr. Stern declined to comment last week on the Treasury proposal, citing Fed rules against its officials speaking publicly in the days surrounding meetings of its Federal Open Market Committee. But he told Congress that the key to tackling problems posed by financial behemoths is to convince uninsured creditors of these companies that they will not be bailed out by the government. (Rescuing uninsured creditors is exactly what the government did a great deal of in 2008; think Bear Stearns and A.I.G.) 
 To protect other companies from also becoming unnecessary casualties when a troubled institution founders, regulators must have a quick-response plan in hand, Mr. Stern advised. Reforms that do not materially reduce spillover effects, he warned in his testimony, shouldn't be relied upon. 
 There isn't much in the Treasury plan about such spillovers. Nevertheless, it is candid about the failings of regulatory efforts during the recent credit boom. ''It is clear now that the government could have done more to prevent many of these problems from growing out of control and threatening the stability of our financial system,'' it says. 
 It's beyond disappointing that the Treasury plan offers no way to measure regulators' effectiveness or hold them accountable for their failures. Neither is there a discussion of mechanisms that could be used to signal regulatory failings well before they put the entire system at peril. 
 True financial reform should reward efficient regulation and supervision, Professor Kane said in his paper. ''Regulators should be made accountable not just for producing a stable financial economy, but for providing this stability fairly and at minimum long-run cost to society,'' he wrote. This means creating incentives that encourage regulators to perform in the taxpayers' interests. 
 ''The public policy problem,'' Professor Kane concluded, ''is to design employment contracts that would make it in supervisors' self-interest to invoke 'market mimicking' disciplines when and as a country's important institutions weaken.'' 
 It may be naive to expect the nation's top regulators to devise ways to ensure that their dismal performance of late will not occur again. But it's certainly worth hoping for.

HEADLINE: People's Open Is Now Official As Crowd's Roar Is Clearly Heard

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Farmingdale, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 There were no calls for restitution at the United States Open on Saturday, no demands for freebies. No matter what they paid, golf fans got their money's worth, hole after hole, round after round, as the evil-looking radar splotches of yellow and green storm cells failed to materialize from the west. 
 After the uproar on Thursday, when rain stopped play after a mere three and a half hours, this time, they played all day. The money was in the till shortly before 9 a.m., as the Open reached the announced 90-minute minimum -- then late in the day, 60 qualifiers kept going into the third round until heavy rain mercifully ended the day at 7:10 p.m. No refund, just reprieve. 
 After two rounds, Ricky Barnes had set a 36-hole record with a 132 total, and Tiger Woods had grimly salvaged his Open with a 69 after his first-round 74. And most important, golf officials did not have to fire tear gas at rebellious fans. 
 This sport is more exciting than I realized, particularly meteorological golf held in my hometown, the world capital of litigation and protest and talk-show bleating. This tournament had been billed as the People's Open because it was being played at a public course, but I did not understand the true ramifications until Thursday. That was when the United States Golf Association first said it would not honor Thursday's tickets for another round after a mere three and a half hours of sodden golf had been completed. 
 As a virtual stranger to golf, I was impressed with the general tolerance of the fans trudging away from the course. I attributed this attitude to the general affluence of anybody who identifies with golf -- money respects money, or something like that. 
 But apparently, after some of the People had fired up the heaters in their cars to take the chill out of their knees, their inner New Yorker kicked in, and they began complaining to radio talk shows or assorted Internet outlets, or they just plain bayed at the moon. 
 Or maybe the protesters never had a ticket to the Open but were acting out of deferred anger over the unbelievable price of tickets our two friendly New York ball clubs have inflicted on the People this season -- prices from which they are now backtracking. 
 The Mets have been discounting tickets for this weekend's series against Tampa Bay, with seats listed at $90 going for $45. And the Yankees rewarded loyal fans who sat out a five-hour rain delay Thursday by allowing them into the expensive seats, with the bonus of using their rain check to purchase selected half-price tickets. 
 And let us not forget the grotesque seat licenses our two friendly football teams are extorting from loyal fans for the new stadium in New Jersey. So the People are not amused. And golf took the hit.
 Sensing the possibility of the People bearing wooden pitchforks and converging on Bethpage Black, the U.S.G.A. executive director, David Fay, said approximately 34,000 tickets from Thursday would be honored on Monday, if the tournament were to be extended an extra day. He noted that somebody had complained to him while he was filling up his car at a gas station, the revolution becoming personal. 
 Until then, I had been under the impression that people who attend events like the Open accept the caveat emptor. The United States Open of tennis has a 90-minute policy, and the British Open of golf accepts two hours of play as fulfilling its responsibility. And at Wimbledon, if it rains all day, sorry, sir, but you may purchase another punnet of strawberries. 
 Real golf fans seem to get the rules. No mulligans. Stephen Folan, who runs a family insurance agency in Port Washington, N.Y., said of his Open ticket for Thursday: ''Once they started, I never expected to be able to use it again. It's not like football or baseball, where they can reschedule it. You can't have 55,000 extra people come back the next day. That's golf.'' Folan did hold on to his ticket but will not be able to use it himself. He has a golf outing with colleagues on Monday. 
 How bad can the economy be if people pay $75 or $100 or more to get very wet and catch a distant glimpse of Tiger Woods? Then again, I have a distant relationship with the sport. I guffaw at the memory of Furio, the pony-tailed gangster on ''The Sopranos,'' as he menaced a doctor for a favorable medical opinion. Furio edged him into the water while delivering his verdict on golf: stupid blankety game. 
 Still, golf is a great sport -- to play or watch. Woods looked miserable Saturday as he tried to marshal himself back into contention. Some golfers do a little dance for joy or shake their head in disgust. I liked the way Nathan Tyler, 26, disdainfully slung his club after holing a bogey from a sand trap. Woods wastes no energy displaying emotions. He always seems to be thinking about the next shot. And he kept himself alive for the third round, on a long day of golf. 
 The main thing was that the U.S.G.A. did not confront the mob, did not detect the clatter of wooden pitchforks. The revolution was averted, for the moment.

LENGTH: 925 words

HEADLINE: ...and One That's Off-Key

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
MORE than a year ago, a Chevrolet marketing man was gamely presenting the new Malibu family sedan to the press in a suburb of New York City. The company had trumpeted a hybrid offshoot of the car, but with the standard Malibu about to go on sale, Chevy became strangely evasive.
 Queried about the hybrid -- how many they would build, when we might see it -- officials hemmed and hawed like parents pressed for the whereabouts of a pregnant teenage daughter. 
 Now we know why. The standard, gasoline-only Malibu turned out to be an impressive family sedan. But it's time to add the Malibu Hybrid to the growing pile of hybrid failures from General Motors.
 These half-hearted efforts have included pickups (now defunct) that couldn't save fuel, but could run your power tools. Even the guys who wear tool belts to weddings wouldn't bite. Then G.M rolled out full-size hybrid S.U.V.'s from Cadillac, Chevy and GMC. These 20-m.p.g. behemoths (with outsize window stickers) have proved as popular as the A.I.G. corporate jet.
 And last week -- long after I had driven the Malibu Hybrid and recorded these impressions -- G.M. abruptly pulled the plug on the car after just a year of production. In May, Chevy sold just 706 Malibu Hybrids, along with only 35 units of its sister car, the Saturn Aura Hybrid.
 The Aura and Malibu are so-called mild hybrids, which makes them as authentic as supermarket salsa. To keep the price down, the Malibu forgoes the things that let full hybrids generate impressive mileage: a large electric motor that can propel the car with no help from the engine, a sizable battery pack and a continuously variable transmission to efficiently mix and match electric and gas power. 
 Instead, the Malibu adopts a simple motor-generator driven by a wide engine belt and connected to a small nickel-metal-hydride battery pack in the trunk. Like other hybrids, the Malibu recharges the batteries by capturing energy generated by coasting or braking.
 Unlike full hybrids, the system delivers only supplementary squirts of electricity; aside from automatically shutting down and restarting at stoplights, the engine is always on duty. The Malibu also gains a bit from a taller rear-end gear ratio that lets the engine spin slower at highway speeds. 
 The car, which starts at $26,275, has a federal rating of 26 miles a gallon in town and 34 on the highway. That's solid mileage for such a roomy, comfortable sedan. The problem is that the conventional 1LT 4-cylinder with an optional 6-speed transmission is nearly as economical at 22/33 m.p.g. and costs $2,325 less, comparably equipped. The feds estimate that the hybrid will save you -- wait for it -- just $146 a year in fuel compared with that 4-cylinder sibling. Even accounting for a one-time $1,550 tax credit, this hybrid won't put you in the black through fuel savings. 
 That wouldn't matter as much if the Malibu Hybrid felt smoother, quicker or more advanced than the straight-up gas version. But it drives worse, not better. 
 The gas pedal and 4-speed transmission misinterpret messages from your right foot, making it hard to hold a steady speed or accelerate smoothly. The result is a queasy sensation of surging and relaxing, especially in heavy traffic and hilly terrain. Drop off the gas to coast, even at freeway speeds, and the clumsy power-regenerating mode makes the car feel as if it is dragging an anchor.
 Because of the batteries, the hybrid also has slightly less trunk space: 13.3 cubic feet compared with 15.1 for the standard model. 
 The Chevy lacks another compelling feature: an animated display screen to coach you to drive more efficiently. Instead, a dull microwave-oven readout shows the trip mileage and an Eco light comes on when you're coasting. A small indicator shows when the 2.4-liter, 164-horsepower engine is sleeping, and a gauge shows whether the batteries are charging or assisting the engine. 
 It's as though G.M. would rather not focus attention on the underachieving system under the hood. 
 These days, offering a hybrid without an engaging system display is like building Yankee Stadium and forgetting the scoreboard. In either case, you want digital fireworks to celebrate the home team's performance. That's what the superior Ford Fusion Hybrid does, with a screen that affirms the owner's enviro-shrewdness even as it helps her to achieve maximum mileage -- in the Ford's case, a knockout 41 m.p.g. in the city.
 Doing my best slow-lane imitation of a Prius driver, I managed a respectable 28 m.p.g. in overall city-highway driving in the Chevy, just below the E.P.A.'s combined estimate of 29 m.p.g. 
 If you are not already scared off by G.M.'s sudden abandonment of this hybrid, the upside is that Malibu Hybrids were being sold at fire-sale prices even before the cancellation. G.M. has pledged to improve its mild-hybrid system and bolt it into yet-unidentified models next year -- small consolation to existing owners. 
 Oddly, while G.M. may win the race to mass-market a plug-in hybrid (the Chevy Volt), it can't seem to build a conventional hybrid to save its endangered life. Perhaps G.M. should take a lesson from the Toyota Prius: sell a hybrid as a loss leader until the technology finds a critical mass of buyers. Those buyers become unpaid spokesmen, bragging to anyone who'll listen about their wonderful Chevy hybrid.
 What G.M. would ultimately gain in buyers and public image might be as valuable as, oh, a spare couple of billion dollars in government aid.

HEADLINE: A Harvest in Brick

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL. 
E-mail: bigdeal@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In the 1970s a real estate investor named Antonios Morfesis paid $1,350 at a city auction for three 25-foot-wide lots on Edgecombe Avenue, near West 140th Street, around the corner from St. Nicholas Park. That payment works out to less than two months' common charges for one of the 12 new condominiums about to open there. 
 Despite the recession, which has dampened sales of new condos across New York City, developers continue to put finished products on the market, just as farmers continue to harvest corn planted long before a slump in the price of grain.
 ''This project took two years to materialize,'' said Romy Goldman, the developer of the small new project, known as Hamilton Lofts. Ms. Goldman bought two of the lots for $850,000 in 2007. By then they had changed hands several times since Mr. Morfesis first snapped them up. 
 Ms. Goldman believes that her project will be able to navigate the troubled market by keeping costs low, providing good value, and qualifying for low-cost financing. The condos, which are in two six-story brick buildings, at 117 and 121 Edgecombe Avenue (separated by the third lot, which was caught up in a title dispute), have asking prices from $539,000 to nearly $700,000 for two- and three-bedroom apartments.
 Each apartment is a 25-foot-wide floor-through unit, with its own keyed elevator, and the prices work out to about $550 per square foot. Last year, Ms. Goldman briefly marketed the apartment at prices about 18 percent higher. But when the economy soured, they were pulled from the market until the work was just about completed.

HEADLINE: A Social Trailblazer, And an Ode to a River

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
FRANCES PERKINS was a 31-year-old social worker, having tea at a friend's townhouse on Washington Square in 1911 when they were interrupted by screams and sirens. She rounded the corner and witnessed the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, in which 146 workers, mostly young Italian and Jewish women, were trapped behind locked doors and died. ''What Frances Perkins saw that day started her on her career,'' a journalist friend later wrote.
 Another journalist, Kirstin Downey, has now published a full-fledged biography of ''The Woman Behind the New Deal: The Life of Frances Perkins, FDR's Secretary of Labor and His Moral Conscience'' (Doubleday, $40). 
 Ms. Downey's book offers fresh insights into a woman who profoundly influenced social welfare legislation in New York and the nation (she worked with Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt), but has been largely forgotten as both a suffrage leader and labor advocate credited with a range of reforms, from fire escapes to Social Security, unemployment benefits to the minimum wage. She was also the first woman to serve in a presidential cabinet.
 Ms. Downey skillfully paints a portrait of a no-nonsense pragmatist who changed her name from Fanny because it left her a ripe target for ridicule, and who wore dowdy attire because she always believed a man responded better to a powerful woman if she looked like his mother. 
 Secretary Perkins also appealed to the enlightened self-interest of political bosses in New York, Albany and Washington by reminding them that tragedies like the Triangle fire were claiming not only innocent victims but constituents as well.
 Much of her outlook was shaped in New York. As a young social worker living in a settlement house, she was asked to intervene when a teenage boy, the sole supporter of his mother and two younger sisters, was arrested. (It would help the narrative to know for what offense.) After a charity organization rejected Miss Perkins's appeals to help the family, she turned to a legendary Democratic leader in Hell's Kitchen. He mostly wanted to know whether Miss Perkins lived in his district. The next day the boy was released. 
 ''Frances never knew exactly how The McManus had done it,'' Ms. Downey writes, referring to Thomas J. McManus, the founder of an enduring Manhattan political dynasty. ''He likely called in a favor at the courthouse, perhaps from an unqualified court official who got his job in exchange for a kickback. Still, the experience taught her the valuable lesson that venal politicians can sometimes be more useful than upstanding reformers.'' 
 September will mark 400 years since Henry Hudson sailed up the Hudson River, the first European explorer to do so. You can get a summertime head start on the festivities armed with ''The Hudson Valley: A Cultural Guide'' (Quantuck Lane Press, $29.95).
 This colorfully illustrated volume, with text and photographs by Benjamin Swett, is an erudite reminder that much of the physical splendor that inspired the Hudson River School of artists in the mid-19th century survives today. In the words of Randall Bourscheidt, the president of the Alliance for the Arts, the nonprofit group that produced the book, there is in fact a ''cultural renaissance'' of music, film, painting, photography and the spoken word throughout the region of the river, from Staten Island to the Adirondacks.

HEADLINE: Dad's Reminders Never Grow Old

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IT'S Father's Day, and I've been trying to think what my father -- keenly missed every hour of every day of these 10 years since he died -- would have said about what's going on in the economy and what it means to Americans as investors. 
 Let me start with the basement of my home in Malibu. It is filled to the brim with file cabinets. In those cabinets are letters from Richard M. Nixon, love notes from high school heartthrobs and, most of all, a mass of material from my primary life work -- the investigation of the Drexel Burnham Lambert-Michael Milken junk-bond scheme. That colossal machination worked because Drexel and its colleagues were able for a while to deny the real default rate of the bonds. 
 By persuading the markets that the bonds defaulted at a rate substantially less than the real rate, the sellers of the junk could demand and receive a higher price for several years. When the real default rate became known, as it inevitably did, the bonds collapsed in value.
 This dragged down many savings and loan associations, insurance companies and other entities that held these junk bonds. And this in turn had some effect in causing the recession of the early 1990s, although certainly not the dominant effect.
 Saying a bond is worth more than it is -- this has been a problem in financial markets for some time. It was a huge issue in the 1920s (remember that Jay Gatsby dealt in bad bonds), and it is a big problem now.
 The subprime crisis was essentially the old junk-bond scam on supersteroids, with nuclear weapons thrown in.
 Collateralized mortgage obligation bonds were sold as having far lower risk of default than was really true for the subprime mortgages within them. This was bad enough. But those bonds were also booby-trapped by being attached to credit-default swaps, like a Viet Cong trap in Quang Tri province in 1971.
 Once the C.M.O. bomb was detonated, its connection to the staggeringly potent credit-default swaps blew holes in immense entities like A.I.G. and took down Lehman Brothers.
 In essence, because of the hugely incorrect estimates of how likely defaults were in a very large asset class owned by the finance sector, the reserves that the sector took for defaults were too small. That meant the earnings of this sector were staggeringly unrealistic and inflated. When these losses were taken, a panic set in and we are still in it: we have badly shaken financial entities and in many cases an extreme hesitation to lend has developed.
 Now, what does this have to do with Father's Day? 
 Only that this kind of thing happens again and again where Wall Street is concerned, as my father, Herbert Stein, the sensible and witty economist, always reminded me. If Wall Streeters can fudge numbers and get very rich from that fudging, some may do it -- and ordinary Americans will see their hard-earned money disappear.
 And as my father used to say, Wall Street makes itself seem indispensable, so it is never really punished.
 Since late 2007, a stupendous amount of Americans' savings has disappeared as prices of stocks and real estate have collapsed. This means that money you and I worked for, and money our fathers worked for and left to us, has vanished, along with some of our hope for a peaceful and serene old age. Again, the responsible parties are sitting pretty.
 What do we do about it? 
 As individual investors, we undoubtedly should hold more cash and short-term Treasuries. We should be more leery of stocks and real estate. It's true that we might miss out on big upward moves in stocks and real estate -- and those moves can be humbling. Nevertheless, we have to be more cautious. 
 It's Father's Day, and some of us have to remember that we are the daddies now. That means that if we aren't cautious, there will be no one there to bail us out except for Daddy Obama, and then only along the margins. 
 It's Father's Day, and, unfortunately, it's time to remember that there's a sucker born every minute, and that plenty of sharp operators are ready -- sometimes wearing yellow suspenders with ducks on them and smiling. 
 It's Father's Day, and I can well imagine my father sympathizing with my losses and saying my grandmother's favorite line: ''Don't worry about it -- you'll do it again.'' And so we do, time after time. 
 Man is divided into predator and prey, and there is some of both in each of us. When our fathers are not there to protect us, we can get into trouble.

HEADLINE: Getting By, by Taking It All Off

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
Good news, everybody. Even in the middle of a major recession that may have hit your industry hard, you can get yourself out of that financial hole. And the people you care about, the ones you sometimes feel you've disappointed? They do love you, very much. And if glossy magazines and TV commercials depress you because you don't look like the latest gym-toned, 20-year-old Versace model, guess what? It doesn't really matter.
 With messages like that, it's no wonder ''The Full Monty'' is such an audience favorite. The sweet and lively new production at the Paper Mill Playhouse, smoothly directed by Mark S. Hoebee, is absolutely exhilarating. And it has the fabulous Elaine Stritch. 
 The timing couldn't be more apt. In 1997, when the movie version, set in Sheffield, England, was released, the story of unemployed steelworkers looking for a way to pay their bills and regain their self-esteem was touching from a distance. In 2000, when the movie morphed into a musical and opened on Broadway, the steelworkers were transplanted to Buffalo, so the situation seemed a bit closer. In 2009, a lot of white-collar Americans can feel these blue-collar characters' pain all too well. 
 It's certainly another sign of changing times that hardly anybody seems shocked or offended by this story about male strippers (that's the job the unemployed men turn to, for one night only). Not even by the split second of multiple full frontal male nudity at the end. It must be one of the few nude scenes in theater history that is best described as heartwarming.
 The musical's central character is Jerry Lukowski (Wayne Wilcox), whose lack of a paycheck may lead him to lose joint custody of his 12-year-old son, Nathan (played alternately by Luke Marcus Rosen and Alex Maizus). He's already behind on child support payments, and his ex-wife (Kelly Sullivan) is with an affluent white-collar guy now. Jerry comes up with the idea to do a male strip show after noticing the big bucks that local women are spending to see a visiting Chippendales-style troupe. 
 Jerry's best pal and former co-worker, Dave Bukatinsky (Joe Coots), doesn't care for the idea, partly because he's considerably overweight. But he is persuaded, and they decide to hold auditions. Meanwhile, they happen upon their old boss, Harold Nichols (Michael Rupert), dancing beautifully with his wife, and blackmail him into joining them. (Harold's wife doesn't know he's unemployed, and he wants to keep it that way.)
 That's where Ms. Stritch comes in, as Jeanette Burmeister, the crusty rehearsal pianist and the only show biz professional in the entire enterprise. As might be expected, Ms. Stritch's star power throws the production a bit off balance, but it's an enjoyable ride.
 She cracks wise about the time ''Arthur Godfrey came on to me'' and her opinion that some people who want to be in show business ''ought to be spayed first.'' For ''Jeanette's Showbiz Number,'' in Act II, she only talk-sings her lyrics, but the audience seems to embrace her just for showing up. 
 The audition scene also includes what is always a showstopper: the song and dance number ''Big Black Man,'' performed by a character, Noah T. Simmons, whose nickname is Horse. This production is fortunate to have Milton Craig Nealy, who played Horse in the national tour of the Broadway production, in the role. Mr. Nealy turns an already disarming musical expression of casual self-confidence into a burst of joy. 
 In the film, several of the men are in line at the unemployment office when they, unconsciously, begin to rehearse their steps, in perfect sync. On the Paper Mill stage, that incident takes place at a graveside service (one man's elderly mother has died). The background music is ''Nearer, My God, to Thee.'' Yeah, these guys can even get away with a hint of sacrilege.
 ''The Full Monty,'' by David Yazbek and Terrence McNally, is at the Paper Mill Playhouse, 22 Brookside Drive, Millburn, through July 12. Information: (973) 376-4343 or papermill.org.

HEADLINE: Harem Envy

BYLINE: By TONI BENTLEY. 
Toni Bentley danced with the New York City Ballet for 10 years and is the author of five books, including ''Sisters of Salome'' and ''The Surrender: An Erotic Memoir.''

 BODY:
THE EAST, THE WEST, AND SEX
 A History of Erotic Encounters
 By Richard Bernstein
 Illustrated. 325 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.95
 ''Harem culture.'' Is that like HBO's series ''Big Love'' except Muslim, not Mormon, and with tassels, a potted palm and no bickering? Well yes, sort of. But there are a lot more women in a harem. A lot. The seraglio of the sultan of the Ottoman Empire housed about 1,600 virgins, each hoping to be chosen for one night of honor. The sultan makes Brigham Young, who had only a few dozen wives, look like a piker with low self-esteem. 
 Yet after reading Richard Bernstein's fascinating new book, ''The East, the West, and Sex'' (which could have been subtitled ''Boys Behaving Badly''), you really have to give the Mormons credit for trying to implement an American version of the infamous harem of ''the East.'' As if that were going to work around here. Most of the world is not only not around here, of course, but also so old and so vast that the United States is less than a blip on the screen of human erotic history. India was playing Twister -- the Kama Sutra version -- more than a thousand years before Columbus got a boat and came to find us. 
 It is a sobering fact that, according to Bernstein, until the mid-19th century, ''most of the world still subscribed to what I have been calling the harem culture, and in only the few countries of the West, the small peninsular domain of Christendom, did a different attitude prevail.'' He describes the harem attitude as ''both more realistic about male sexual desire than the Western culture of chastity and monogamy and less sentimental about it.'' Bernstein's harem mirrors the Darwinian male mind, which is sexually programmed for youth, beauty, variety and a great deal of it, ''a place of limitless erotic possibility'' where lust and pity party.
 Already your mind is wandering from this dry -- unless you just spilled your coffee -- flat page to a smoky room filled with the potent scent of sandalwood and hashish, where exotic young women with veils on their limbs and bells on their ankles dance languidly (sans pole) as you recline on a red brocade divan bulging with pillows, while another beautiful, silky-haired girl. . . . But wait, before you take that final plunge (or puff) that brings perfect wisdom and contentment, come back! We must first consider the political, social, economic (the old ''he has the money, she doesn't'' routine) and feminist (ditto but with outrage) implications of the intoxicating collision between Caucasian heterosexual men and, well, any lovely young thing who is not of their own ethnic or cultural heritage. It is here that Bernstein comes to our aid with his accessible, much-researched and far-reaching book -- though his subject is so complex that he provides only a bare introduction, a kind of hybrid of history, interview and anecdote. 
 Bernstein also proffers a rather stiff agenda. ''Orientalism,'' as defined most famously by Edward Said, means, Bernstein writes, that ''the Western vision of the Orient is a highly eroticized one that arose not from reality but from the need to find in the East what had been planted in the Western mind even before Westerners started going there.'' Bernstein searches for evidence that the sexualized East is not just a Western wet dream but a reality, and just about drowns in his findings. (It should be noted that one could easily stumble on the same lusty iniquities in New York, London or Paris if horizontally inclined.) ''The eroticized vision of the East carries a hard kernel of truth,'' he reports from the trenches, ''which the followers of Said are loath to acknowledge.'' Let the battle continue.
 The author of six previous books and a columnist for The International Herald Tribune, Bernstein has logged more than 30 years of distinguished service as a journalist; as a former head of Time's Beijing bureau and The New York Times's bureaus in Paris and Berlin, he has spent considerable time overseas and plenty in the lands of which he speaks. He covers a lot of terrain: from second-century Chinese sex manuals that describe the beautiful bodies -- ''supple like grass'' -- of dancing girls, who ''put forth all their charms so that one forgets life and death''; to Marco Polo's reports on imperial concubines in the 14th century; to the 16th century, when ''Portuguese seamen cohabited with local women in Goa, Malacca, Sumatra and Japan''; to Bangkok today, where the glories of empire have been reduced to the bars and bordellos of Patpong Road. 
 Bernstein defines the East as ''most of the world's territory from North and East Africa to South, Southeast and East Asia.'' If your geography is a little fuzzy, this includes Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia, Tunisia, Yemen, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Japan, and, oh yes, China and India. I must protest. Isn't this so broad a definition of the East as to be rendered both meaningless and insulting -- and, in our post-9/11 world, rather irresponsible, not to mention retro? (It's like saying that Los Angeles is all about movie stars, medical marijuana, unreadable screenplays and gargantuan lips -- O.K., not a good example.) I hate to spoil the fun, but is it really appropriate to throw all these incredibly numerous and varied countries, not to mention their women, into one big bouillabaisse called ''the East''?
 It is true, however, that many of the different cultures Bernstein studies do have ancient histories of sexual sophistication, and often sweetness, far beyond what's been attained in the West, despite the considerable efforts of the Marquis de Sade, Hugh Hefner, the Moonlite Bunny Ranch and the silicone hills of the San Fernando Valley. It is not news that Christianity, with its Virgin Birth (just to start things off right), has had little interest in exploring human sexual desire or potential. Sexual energy is way too out of control even for the most committed Christians (see the Holy Trinity of Bakker, Swaggart and Haggard). Remember, genetically, we're far more bonobo than righteous, and ''harem culture'' answers the simian call.
 fter telling us the sordid and predictable tale of a foreign English teacher in present-day China boasting on his blog of his own mini-harem of Chinese conquests, Bernstein quickly takes us back to the good old days of imperialism and colonialism, when the British, French and Dutch moved in on the East -- like a bad boyfriend in every way -- and then to the mid-20th century, when unerring American know-how took its profligate and tacky turn in Vietnam, producing ''a wartime erotic circus of historic proportions,'' and the V.D. to match. The story was certainly much prettier when ''Madama Butterfly,'' ''The Mikado,'' ''The Arabian Nights,'' Japanese woodcuts, and Delacroix and Ingres provided the prism through which to view the East as a rhapsody of delicacy and ecstasy.
 When Flaubert traveled to Egypt in 1849, he, along with Sir Richard Burton -- easily the most interesting men in Bernstein's book -- recorded some of the most detailed, salacious and divine views of sex in the East, which still color our vision today. Flaubert adored prostitution (even in Paris!): ''a meeting place of so many elements -- lust, bitterness, complete absence of human contact, muscular frenzy, the clink of gold.'' In the dancer Kuchuk Hanem, he found the soul of his East. Her vagina (not the word Flaubert used) ''felt like rolls of velvet. . . . I felt like a tiger,'' he wrote. ''My night was one long, infinitely intense reverie. . . . Toward the end there was something sad and loving in the way we embraced.'' En Egypte, Madame Bovary, ce n'est pas moi!
 Burton, one of the most brilliant and romantic figures of the 19th century, conducted parallel searches for the source of the Nile and the source of Flaubert's pleasure, not unconnected drives. While he did not quite succeed with the Nile, he did find that certain tribal slave girls made expert use of ''the constrictor vaginae muscles,'' so that a woman could induce her partner's orgasm ''not by wriggling and moving but by tightening and loosing the male member with the muscles of her privities.'' (Now there's a decent indecent word for us, girls!) She was known as a kabbazah, which in Arabic means ''holder.'' Holders were quite expensive. Meanwhile, of the single brutal swipe that rendered a boy a eunuch, Burton reported laconically, ''He often survives.'' 
 The first Viscount Wolseley, a field marshal in the British Army, brashly admitted that he ''consorted with an 'Eastern princess' '' who provided ''all the purposes of a wife without any of the bother,'' and that he had no plans to marry '' 'some bitch' in Europe, unless she were an heiress.'' Today the viscount could read Burton on how best to survive the castration likely to come his way. (It involves boiling water and implantation ''in a fresh dunghill.'')
 A commander in the Indian Army in 1803, one David Ochterlony, landed himself 13 spouses and ''liked to parade around Delhi with his wives following behind, each on her own elephant.'' Not exactly the kind of afternoon outing he could take through Beacon Hill back in Boston, where he was born. 
 In one of his well-meaning attempts to look at the female side of things in this very male-oriented book, Bernstein states that in the age of exploration ''it would seem implausible, if not entirely impossible, for there to be a story of, say, a Frenchwoman who falls in love with a Persian or Arab adventurer.'' But if you want to know what the girls were doing while the boys were indulging themselves, try Lesley Blanch's transporting classic ''The Wilder Shores of Love,'' where you will find the (Caucasian) ladies of Arabia doing even more brave and interesting things than the gentlemen, as well as having plenty of sex with Bedouin sheiks. 
 Bernstein's survey suggests a near-perfect illustration of the psychotherapist Jack Morin's simple but brilliant sexual equation -- Attraction + Obstacles = Excitement -- where being ''neither too close nor too far'' is the ideal distance from one's beloved. While Bernstein's book provocatively externalizes, and maps, the heterosexual male erotic mind, he does not dig deeper into the real heart of darkness, the labyrinth where sex actually takes place, where hostility, anxiety, Oedipus and inequality (the truly erotic cannot distinguish the politically incorrect from a cheap garter belt) mingle with the overwhelming desire to merge. His book's real topic is the history of men's joy in defiling, often while loving, what is innocent and beautiful, of finding purity and wantonness in one.
 Unfortunately, but perhaps of necessity, Bernstein does a certain amount of apologetic tiptoeing around his subject -- with phrases like ''it could be argued'' -- owing to the extremely politically incorrect nature of the facts: voracious males and compliant females are his subjects. The result of this journalistic diplomacy is that his writing has little edge, while his subject is all edge. He suggests rather meekly, early on, ''Let's not be judgmental about this, at least not yet.'' But the orgy he is discussing constitutes the male West having global intercourse with the female East on Aladdin's magic carpet, leaving Western women and Eastern men awkwardly conversing in the Jacuzzi. Try as Bernstein does to find them a connection, they simply do not have much interest in each other. So hold on tight, feminists, Bernstein's got a major bone for you to chew. But don't worry, in your favor, he has written a not very sexy book about a very sexy subject. He describes the women of Asia as ''more plumlike than melonlike of breast, spare rather than full of buttocks and hips.'' Where is young Flaubert when you need him? 
 Bernstein does risk a bit of passion (if that's not an oxymoron), but only, literally, in the last sentence of his book -- like the lover who finally weeps as he departs -- when he writes of the ''power of the urge that has populated the globe, that drives some men crazy and makes other men wise, the urge for a moment of delirious, primal, sublime contact with an exquisite perfumed creature.'' The topic is clearly very close to his heart: the book is dedicated to his wife, the beautiful Chinese dancer Zhongmei Li, whom he calls ''my vision of the East.'' 
 But Bernstein has let us know all along that he is a decent sort of fellow, and just in case we suspect he's a little too pro-harem he tells us that ''wisdom, of course, teaches that the greatest sexual pleasure for a man comes in a healthy monogamous and loving relationship with one woman.'' Whose wisdom is this? Dr. Phil's? It's not the wisdom of anybody who tells the truth.
 Let's leave something as nebulous as the truth to the great mystic poet Jalaluddin Rumi -- born 800 years ago in the land of those dancing girls -- a man who knew the value of a veil and the real nature of the longing behind all that mind-bending harem sex: 
 If you want what visible reality can give, you're an employee. If you want the unseen world, you're not living your truth. Both wishes are foolish, but you'll be forgiven for forgetting that what you really want is love's confusing joy.

HEADLINE: The Last-Minute Guide to Summer Camping

BYLINE: By JANE MARGOLIES

 BODY:
CARLA AND JIM BOERMAN of Walworth, N.Y., have been campers for nearly two decades, starting when their twin daughters, who are now in college, were just 18 months old. Their family has stayed in Yellowstone and Yosemite, and they've sampled campgrounds in New York and neighboring states, graduating fStaterom pop-ups to small travel trailers to a 30-foot fifth wheel. Last year, the Boermans went on 18 camping trips, for a total of 50 nights under the stars. 
 But this year, Mrs. Boerman, a school secretary, has noticed something new: campgrounds are fuller, and booking reservations has gotten trickier. ''Even if you're calling months in advance, you might not get the exact campsite you want,'' she said, ''or you might have to adjust your dates.'' 
 Although it's still early in the season, there are already signs that more Americans will be vacationing in campgrounds this summer. Bookings are up at many parks -- in some cases by as much as 30 percent. And some campgrounds were filled on weekends even before Memorial Day, the traditional kickoff of the camping season. 
 Many in the camping community believe that the bad economy is causing this sudden interest in the great outdoors, with people who are worried about finances forgoing a stay at a fancy resort or a trip overseas in favor of a sojourn in the woods that can cost 10 bucks a night. Gas prices that are significantly lower than last summer's (albeit rising) may also be affecting decisions to hit the road.
 Suzi Dow, who with her husband, Fred Dow, writes guides to United States Forest Service campgrounds, said that back in April, traffic to their Web site, Forestcamping.com, reached 300,000 hits a day, a rate they don't normally see until summer, and the queries were decidedly more family-focused.
 ''In the past, young people, singles, were writing to us saying, 'Hey, I want to go to Glacier National Park and want to do it in two weeks,' '' Mrs. Dow said. ''Now we're hearing from families who want to know where to go so their 10-year-old son can go fishing and 13-year-old daughter can have hot showers.'' 
 Although certain parks have always been magnets, camping in general has been declining for a generation, according to the National Park Service. In 1980, there were 3.93 million overnight tent stays at Park Service properties, including the country's 58 national parks, which contain 861 campgrounds ranging from primitive (pit toilets) to modern (hot showers); last year, 2.95 million stays were registered. 
 General visitation is down, too, prompting the Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, whose department includes the Park Service, to announce that 147 of its sites would waive entrance fees this weekend and two other weekends this summer (July 18 and 19, and Aug. 15 and 16). 
 ''I'm optimistic,'' said David Barna, the chief of public affairs for the National Park Service, whose budget this year increased to $2.5 billion from $2.4 billion last year. This does not count $741 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, some of which will go toward campground upgrades like restroom remodeling and the resurfacing of access roads later this year. ''Typically, when the economy is not in good shape that bodes well for the park service,'' Mr. Barna said. 
 Indeed, bookings at the 141 national park campgrounds in the National Recreation Reservation Service were up 9 percent from January through March 26 over the same period last year. The reservations are handled by ReserveAmerica, a private company, through the Web site Recreation.gov and at (877) 444-6777 (a fee of $10 is added). 
 Although many experienced campers booked five and six months ago, when many national park campsites went on sale, the good news for latecomers is that there is still plenty of room at campgrounds that take reservations, particularly during midweek, when demand is lower. 
 Cancellations do occur, and first-come-first-served campgrounds abound. (Arrive in the morning, when the previous night's campers are checking out.) 
 In addition to Park Service properties, there are 5,800 campgrounds in national forests and grasslands, not to mention campgrounds in state parks. 
 Following is a guide for people interested in scoring a campsite at one of the country's most popular national parks this summer, along with alternatives if their first choice is sold out. The information was accurate as of June 15. 
 ACADIA NATIONAL PARK: MAINE (207) 288-3338; www.nps.gov/acad Travel Guide
 On Mount Desert Island off the Atlantic coast of Down East Maine, this park has rocky beaches, 1930s carriage roads (ideal for hiking and biking) and two wooded campgrounds, both renovated within the last five years.
 Campground Status The Blackwoods Campground (207-288-3274; reservations: 877-444-6777 or www.recreation.gov; $20), which is convenient to carriage roads, hiking trails, the Park Loop Road and Bar Harbor, five miles north, takes reservations for nearly all its 290 sites. It is already booked for the Fourth of July weekend but has openings at other times, according to Jennifer Webber, the Blackwoods supervisor. 
 Seawall Campground (207-244-3600; $14 for walk-ins, $20 for vehicles), on the quieter western side of the park, has 205 sites -- tents are separated from RVs -- available first come first served. Even during peak camping season -- the last two weeks of July and the first two of August -- ''you have a good chance of getting a spot at Seawall,'' said the Seawall supervisor, Don Jenkins.
 Also Consider Just across Frenchman Bay from Mount Desert is the 62-site Lamoine State Park Campground (207-667-4778; www.maine.gov/doc/parks; reservations: 800-332-1501 for Maine residents, $15; 207-624-9950 for everyone else, $25; or at www.campwithme.com). 
 GLACIER NATIONAL PARK: MONTANA (406) 888-7800; www.nps.gov/glac
 By late June, the snow that blankets this million-acre park in the northern Rockies for much of the year is melting, and most of the 13 campgrounds, with 1,009 sites, have opened.
 Campground Status All but two of the park's campgrounds are welcoming guests, with Logging Creek and Quartz Creek slated to open by July 1. The two campgrounds in the park that take reservations (877-444-6777 or www.recreation.gov; $23) -- the 178-site Fish Creek Campground, on the west side of the park, and 148-site St. Mary Campground, on the east side -- have ample availability. 
 In this park, the first-come-first-served campgrounds, most of which are smaller than the those that can be reserved, tend to be the most desirable. The Many Glacier Campground ($20) -- which offers 109 sites among aspen and pine trees, ranger programs and prime access to trails, including one leading to (you guessed it) a glacier -- often fills by 11 a.m. Wondering what your chances are? This park's sophisticated Web site keeps campers informed with a continuously updated map showing where there are openings, and calendars indicating when each campground has historically reached capacity.
 Also Consider The Flathead and Lewis and Clark National Forests (www.fs.fed.us) border Glacier National Park and have campgrounds near the park's western, southern and eastern entrances. Example: The Big Creek Campground (406-387-3800; $13), in Flathead, two and a half miles from the Camas Creek entrance on the western side of the park, has 22 first-come-first-served sites on the north fork of the Flathead River (garbage must be packed out).
 GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK: ARIZONA (928) 638-7888; www.nps.gov/grca Travel Guide
 The 277-mile-long, mile-deep canyon divides the park into two parts: the more accessible, and visited, South Rim, where there are two campgrounds; and the higher-elevation North Rim, which has a single campground.
 Campground Status On the South Rim, the 327-site Mather Campground takes reservations (877-444-6777 or www.recreation.gov; $18) and still has openings, but ''has been filling up by midafternoon every day,'' according to Jim O'Sickey, the deputy fee-program manager for the park. The Desert View Campground ($12) is first come first served, and its 50 sites generally fill by early afternoon. The North Rim Campground takes reservations for its 88 sites (877-444-677 and www.recreation.gov; $18 and $25), but has only a scattering of openings in July, slightly more in August.
 Also Consider Kaibab National Forest (www.fs.fed.us/r3/kai) borders Grand Canyon National Park and has campgrounds near park entrances. For example, 4.5 miles from the park's South Rim entrance, Ten-X Campground (928-638-2443; $10) has 70 primitive sites available first come first served. 
 On the North Rim, there's the DeMotte Campground (928-643-7395; $17), with 32 sites five miles from the park (fills between noon and 3 p.m.); and 52-site Jacob Lake Campground, 30 miles from the park, which rarely fills. Both are first come first served and were recently renovated.
 GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK AND JOHN D ROCKEFELLER JR. MEMORIAL PARKWAY: WYOMING (307) 739-3300; www.nps.gov/grte Travel Guide
 Along with the peaks of the Teton Range, jutting up from a sage-covered plain, the park and the parkway, the eight-mile scenic connection between this park and Yellowstone, have six campgrounds and an RV park, all run as concessions.
 Campground Status Flagg Ranch (800-443-2311 and www.flaggranch.com; $25 and $50 a night), a reservation campground five miles north of Grand Teton, has 30 percent of its 86 RV sites available and 70 percent of its 74 tent sites available for July, according to Mike Perikly, the president of Flagg Ranch Resort; bookings are lighter in August. 
 Of the nonreserved campgrounds, Jenny Lake (800-628-9988 and www.gtlc.com/lodging; $19 and $7), with 59 tent-only sites (10 are for hikers and bicyclists only) among evergreens and glacial boulders near the lake for which it's named, is the most popular and sometimes fills as early as 10 a.m. The same company runs the 350-site Gros Ventre Campground, and even visitors arriving late at night should be able to find a spot there, according to a park spokeswoman, Jackie Skaggs.
 Signal Mountain (800-672-6012; www.signalmountainlodge.com; $20) has 81 sites that typically are occupied by noon.
 Also Consider The Caribou-Targhee (in Idaho) and Bridger-Teton National Forests (www.fs.fed.us) border Grand Teton National Park and have campgrounds near park entrances. The campground guidebook author Suzi Dow suggests driving a bit farther, to Granite Creek Campground (307-734-7400; $15), in Bridger-Teton, 45 minutes south of the park, for its 51 first-come-first-served sites near a hot springs-fed pool built into the side of a mountain.
 GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK: TENNESSEE AND NORTH CAROLINA (865) 436-1200; www.nps.gov/grsm Travel Guide
 Among the misty mountains of America's most visited national park -- marking its 75th anniversary this year -- are 10 developed campgrounds, four of which take reservations.
 Campground Status All four reservation campgrounds (877-444-6777 or www.recreation.gov; $14 and $23) -- the 142-site Smokemont, the 159-site Cades Cove, the 220-site Elkmont and the 165-site Cosby -- are almost fully booked for the Fourth of July weekend, but have openings at other times. All but 20 sites at Cosby, a good jumping-off point for hiking to the Mount Cammerer Fire Tower -- with fabulous 360-degree views, rare in this forested park -- are first come first served. Balsam Mountain (45 sites), at 5,310 feet, is the coolest spot on hot nights; Deep Creek (92 sites), in North Carolina, offers fishing and tubing; and peaceful Look Rock (68 sites) is ideal for campers who want to string up a hammock and do absolutely nothing.
 Also Consider The Cherokee, Pisgah and Nantahala National Forests (www.fs.fed.us) border the national park. Tsali Campground (828-479-6431; $15), in Nantahala, a half-hour from the southern boundary of the park, has 42 unreserved sites, hot showers and a network of mountain-biking trails.
 OLYMPIC NATIONAL PARK: WASHINGTON (360) 565-3130; www.nps.gov/olym Travel Guide
 Thanks to the ''Twilight'' books -- the young-adult series about the romance between a high-school girl and a vampire, written by Stephenie Meyer and set in the Forks, Wash., area -- this park has been drawing a new breed of visitor. These ''Twihards'' wander, wide-eyed, down trails in the misty Hoh rain forest under giant trees festooned with moss, ''trying to see what Bella saw,'' said a park ranger, Jon Preston. He estimated that at times up to 30 percent of park visitors are Twilight-related and said that he was contemplating putting together a nature program on bloodsuckers (mosquitoes, flies and lampreys).
 Olympic has 16 campgrounds, all run by the Park Service.
 Campground Status The sole reservation campground, the 170-site Kalaloch (877-444-6777 or www. recreation.gov; $14 to $18), on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, has only scattered openings. Of the other campgrounds, the 82-site Sol Duc Campground ($14), with a riverside location, great hiking and proximity to the pools at the Sol Duc Hot Springs Resort, often fills by noon. The 88-site Hoh Campground ($12) is right in the rain forest, and, Mr. Preston said, almost always has openings.
 Also Consider The Olympic National Forest (www.fs.fed.us/r6/olympic) surrounds the national park. Nine miles from the park's northwest entrance, the Klahowya Campground (360-374-6522; $17), with 55 spacious, moss- and fern-covered sites, many of them right on the Sol Duc River, is first come first served. 
 ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK: COLORADO (970) 586-1206; www.nps.gov/romo
 The chance to ogle ''charismatic megafauna''-- the elk, bighorn sheep, moose and other large animals that roam within easy viewing distance -- is part of the allure of this land of majestic mountains. Five campgrounds await, and sadly, so does a beetle epidemic that has infected forests from British Columbia to Mexico. The park has removed many dead trees and sprayed others, and these continuing efforts will result in fewer campsites this summer, though an exact count has yet to be determined.
 Campground Status The two campgrounds taking reservations (877-444-6777 or www.recreation.gov; $20) -- the 245-site Moraine Park Campground, in a ponderosa pine forest with Continental Divide views; and the 54-site Aspenglen, bordering the Fall River -- are already booked on weekends through July, though there are some openings midweek. There is more availability in August, including on weekends. 
 Glacier Basin ($20), where many infected lodgepole pine trees have been removed, has opened 61 sites; parts of the 98-site Timber Creek ($20) are expected to open by the end of June. Both these campgrounds no longer have the woodsy character that they did in the past. 
 But Longs Peak, in the southern part of the park, with 26 first-come-first-served sites for tents only, is as yet unaffected by the epidemic, according to Kyle Patterson, a park spokeswoman.
 Also Consider The Arapaho, Roosevelt, and Routt National Forests (www.fs.fed.us) border Rocky Mountain National Park and have campgrounds near park entrances. Five miles from the Wild Basin entrance on the east side of the park is Olive Ridge (303-541-2500), in the Roosevelt National Forest, with 56 sites, half of which can be reserved after June 26 (877-444-6777 or www.recreation.gov).
 SEQUOIA AND KINGS CANYON NATIONAL PARKS: CALIFORNIA (559) 565-3341; www.nps.gov/seki
 Groves of giant sequoias are the big draw at these adjoining parks in the southern Sierra Nevada. Overnight stays increased almost 8 percent in 2007, and 5 percent last year. Fourteen campgrounds offer more than 1,200 sites in all.
 Campground Status The two campgrounds that accept reservations (877-444-6777 and www.recreation.gov; $20), both in Sequoia, are the largest and busiest: 203-site Lodgepole is fully booked for summer, and 204-site Dorst Creek is fully booked on weekends and 80 to 85 percent on weekdays. But it doesn't hurt to check for cancellations before your visit and no-shows when you arrive. Tracy Thetford, the revenue and fee business manager, said, ''We sell 10 to 15 percent of the sites with daily walk-up sales.'' Among the other campgrounds ($12 and $18), the 40-site Potwisha and 28-site Buckeye Flat, which are near the entrance to Sequoia, tend to fill by early Friday evening.
 Also Consider The Inyo, Sierra and Sequoia National Forests (www.fs.fed.us) surround the parks, and there are campgrounds in Sequoia National Forest (877-444-6777 or www.reserveamerica.com) convenient to the entrances of both parks (the 90-site Princess, $18, and 74-site Hume Lake, $20, for instance). Eshom (559-338-2251; $18), also in Sequoia, and reached by a narrow, dusty hairpin-turn drive, has 23 first-come-first-served campsites in a former Indian settlement.
 YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK: WYOMING, MONTANA, IDAHO (307) 344-7381; www.nps.gov/yell Travel Guide
 America's first national park (1872), famous for its steaming hot springs, bubbling mud pots, exploding geysers and roaming grizzlies, bison and elk, has 12 campgrounds. Four of them and an RV park, run by Xanterra Parks and Resorts, take reservations; the Park Service operates the other seven on a first-come-first-served basis. There are 2,100 sites in all, and most of them fill up every night from mid-May through mid-August.
 Campground Status The Xanterra campgrounds (866-439-7375 or www.travelyellowstone.com; $18.50) still have ample availability, according to Rick Hoeninghausen, director of marketing and sales for Yellowstone, but ''walk-ins have been strong.'' The RV park ($35) is almost sold out through the second week of August. The Park Service campgrounds ($12 and $14) often fill by 10 a.m.
 Also Consider The Beaverhead, Gallatin, Custer, Caribou-Targhee and Shoshone National Forests (fs.fed.us) surround Yellowstone and have campgrounds on all sides of the park. Three miles from Yellowstone's west entrance, in Gallatin, is the Baker's Hole Campground (406-646-1012; www.hebgenbasincampgrounds.com; $14 and $20), which has 73 first-come-first-served campsites and fishing on the Madison River -- all that separates the grounds from Yellowstone. 
 Just southwest of the park, in the Caribou-Targhee National Forest, the Cave Falls Campground (208-652-7442; $10) is rustic and secluded, with 23 unreserved sites a mile from Cave Falls, in Yellowstone's backcountry.
 YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK: CALIFORNIA (209) 372-0200; www.nps.gov/yose Travel Guide
 This 1,200-square-mile wilderness in the heart of the Sierra Nevada has 13 National Park Service-run campgrounds containing 1,410 sites. (A 1997 flood wiped out 353 campsites.)
 Campground Status The seven that accept reservations (877-444-6777 or www. recreation.gov; $20) -- two of them also have first-come-first-served sites -- sold out in minutes, as they do every year, when they went on sale five months ago. Cancellations do occur, and no-shows mean that spots at these campgrounds can open up at any time. 
 But visitors' best bets are the first-come-first-served campgrounds ($10 and $14). At Camp 4, the only such campground in Yosemite Valley, lines form at 6 a.m. for the 35 walk-in sites. The farther campers go from this prime area, the more likely they are to get a spot as the day wears on. ''You have a better chance of getting into Tuolumne Meadows than you do at Tamarack Flat,'' Ranger Kari Cobb said.
 Also Consider Yosemite National Park is surrounded by the Inyo, Sierra and Stanislaus National Forests (www.fs.fed.us) with campgrounds near entrances on all sides of the park. Three to five minutes from the eastern entrance, in Inyo, are the rustic Lee Vining campgrounds (760-647-3044; $19), including Tioga Lake, with 13 unreserved sites right across the lake from Yosemite. 
 THE STATE PARK SQUEEZE
 All 50 states have park systems of their own, together offering 1,737 camping areas with almost 213,000 sites, according to the National Association of State Park Directors. 
 Overnight stays increased 12 percent in the year ending June 30, 2008, to 15,486,687, the association, based in Raleigh, N.C., reported. But this total was still well below the peak of 18,011,516 stays in 2003. 
 This year, budget cuts have forced parks to reduce the days some campgrounds are open, close less popular sections and, in some cases, shut down campgrounds altogether. In New York, for instance, where reservations statewide are up 5 percent over last year, two campgrounds have been closed, and in California, a proposal is under consideration that could result in the shuttering of 220 parks and 56 percent of the state-park campsites. 
 ReserveAmerica (through www.reserveamerica.com and the company's call centers) handles campground reservations for 19 states; other states have their own reservation systems. The Missouri State Parks and Historic Sites Web site (www.mostateparks.com/camping.htm), for example, lets you look up campgrounds, then click on photos of actual campsites at some of the parks -- not just general campground views -- so campers can pick the home away from home that appeals to them most.

HEADLINE: A Comedy to Inspire Premise Envy

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
A HUSBAND and wife are in the kitchen of their Los Angeles home one day, talking. Not arguing; just talking. The wife is chopping a carrot; just -- chopping a carrot. Their conversation is spurred by that familiar question: You know what would make a great television show? 
 No. What?
 First of all, enough already with mobsters and men with guns. How about a fresh comedy, with a male protagonist who is just a regular guy, a high school teacher, maybe, who coaches basketball? And what if his marriage had broken up, and he had no money, and the local economy was tanking? 
 The carrot-chopping wife, Colette Burson, then says: And what if he had nothing going for him except that he had a really big penis?
 Actually, Ms. Burson used another term that cannot be published here. In fact, such effort is being made here to write this story without violating propriety -- or without slipping in a few sophomoric double entendres -- that the words being muttered at this very moment make Ms. Burson's original term seem almost Psalm-like.
 Now back to the kitchen conversation. So Ms. Burson says, wouldn't it be great if the down-on-his-luck-regular-guy protagonist had a big penis? To which her husband, Dmitry Lipkin, immediately gives a name to this imaginary show: ''Hung.''
 These two professional writers giggle, eat their raw salad with chopped-up carrots -- and before long sell this concept to HBO. Next Sunday will offer the premiere of a comedy about a teacher in Michigan. Once a star athlete who seemed destined for success, he is divorced, separated from his children and so financially strapped that he is camping outside the fire-damaged home inherited from his parents. Heeding the words of a motivational speaker, he vows to capitalize on his greatest asset (see above) and decides to become a male prostitute.
 The show's name: ''Hung.''
 HBO is banking on this show to become a breakout hit. Not just a niche-market gem like ''Flight of the Conchords'' or a critical (but ratings-challenged) darling like ''In Treatment,'' but something that speaks to the national mood, a ''Sex and the City'' for both sexes that would cement the reputation of a relatively new management team at the cable channel. It is the first show to be nurtured from conception by Sue Naegle, the president of HBO's entertainment division; she started championing the ''Hung'' proposal the moment she assumed the job 13 months ago.
 Michael Lombardo, the president of HBO's programming group and West Coast operations, admits to having a ''multitude of reactions'' when he first heard the show's proposed name, which he acknowledges comes with its share of marketing challenges. ''It diminished my expectations about what was to follow,'' he said. ''At the same time it was clearly provocative and it piqued my interest. Then I read it and I fell in love with the script.''
 Ms. Burson, 40, a playwright, and Mr. Lipkin, 42, the creator and head writer of the ''The Riches,'' the canceled FX show about con artists on the lam, discussed the show's evolution during a recent three-way telephone conversation, with Mr. Lipkin in Los Angeles and Ms. Burson in Detroit, where another episode was being filmed. These partners in life and in writing prefer to be interviewed together, which made for a lot of talking over each other. 
 But they talked as one in saying that -- the name notwithstanding, a name they never once considered changing -- their show is more than a mischievous one-liner. Yes, at first it was a joke. Whenever people asked what project they were working on, they would matter-of-factly say: ''We're working on a show called 'Hung.' It's about a guy with a really big penis.''
 Gradually, though, the couple realized the possibilities of this throwaway joke, and together they developed the characters and plot. They explore economic pressures and male-female relationships, while trying to answer the question: Who would you find if you tracked down the Big Man on Campus some 20 years after his high school graduation? 
 Ms. Burson and Mr. Lipkin set the story in Michigan in part because it is, sadly, the First State of Economic Distress. But they made this choice before the national recession took hold, which meant that in a strange but hardly serendipitous way, others around the country might now identify with a struggling teacher from a middle-class Detroit suburb, or with his ex-wife's new husband, a wealthy dermatologist whose net worth suddenly drops. 
 ''I think we were a little ahead of the curve,'' Ms. Burson said, referring to the recession, and not to some trend in which more and more men are moonlighting as male escorts.
 As for the protagonist, Ray Drecker, played by Thomas Jane (''The Punisher,'' the HBO movie ''61*''), there is a sweet earnestness in the way he comes to realize that while he may be endowed, and while he may consider himself a stud, he has much to learn about women. 
 ''He's so outmatched, I think,'' Mr. Lipkin said. ''There is sex in the show. But a lot of it is not sexual. It's psychological. It's emotional.''
 ''But he's not a dolt,'' Ms. Burson added. ''He loves women.''
 True. But the show is not called ''The Dolt Who Loved Women.'' The writers have turned a penis into a plot device. What's more, judging by the first four episodes, they advance the theory -- fact? myth? -- that bigger is better, risking the alienation of a sought-after segment of television viewers: men who are average in every way. The writers said they didn't want to make too much of this. Although Mr. Lipkin asserted that ''smaller is not better.'' And Ms. Burson said: ''It's just like a car with leather seats. It's better than cloth.''
 Where were we?
 Anyway, in the opinion of Tim Brooks, a pre-eminent television historian and the co-author of ''The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present,'' the writers and HBO know exactly what they are doing. ''It's all about marketing, it's all about breakthrough, it's all about titillation,'' he said. ''They want to make people think they're going to see something they haven't seen in the past.''
 This is a standard technique. Take, for example, ''Three's Company,'' that long-ago sitcom about a single man sharing an apartment with two (!) single women. Nudge, nudge. This living arrangement managed to wink at America from 1977 to 1984, until, finally, all that chastity exhausted the country.
 Given the name and premise of ''Hung,'' the first episode or two will almost certainly attract viewers, including those who may merely want to educate themselves about the, the, the emotional needs of the opposite sex. Yeah, that's it. Emotional needs.
 ''But once they sample the show, it has to be a strong show,'' Mr. Brooks said, adding: ''They won't come back to see bits and pieces of genitalia. They will come back to see characters they like and writing that is really sharp.''
 Mr. Lombardo, HBO's programming chief, said he never doubted the power of the writing. He just felt that the title at least warranted a chat about whether it was appropriate. When that chat finally took place, everyone agreed: Stick with ''Hung.''
 The conversation, he added, was surprisingly short.

HEADLINE: The Uncertain Future Life Of Ashton Ballets

BYLINE: By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

 BODY:
A BALLET dies with the fall of the curtain. Nobody knows whether the inner life that makes each ballet special will still be there next year, or even tomorrow. The text of a ballet's steps may be preserved by film, notation or the often remarkable memories of dancers, but you can use all three and still find that what was a living work of theater has become a mausoleum. 
 Merce Cunningham, who recently announced plans for the preservation of his choreography after his death, probably knows the problems as well as anybody. In recent years when two of his 1980s works were revived, ''Fabrications'' (1987) looked even fresher than it had in its original production, but ''Pictures'' (1984), which when new seemed like Prospero's Isle and proved the most popular success his company had ever enjoyed, had inexplicably lost its spell. 
 Nonetheless many ballets manage to survive their makers. George Balanchine (1904-83) and Frederick Ashton (1904-88) -- the world's foremost choreographers of classical ballet in the last half of the 20th century (their equals have not yet emerged) -- both often spoke with skepticism about the survival of their ballets but then acknowledged the likelihood of their survival by bequeathing them to specific friends in their wills. 
 Following Balanchine's example in this, Ashton singled out six friends in his will, leaving to each a brace of ballets. The ballerina Margot Fonteyn, for example, received ''Daphnis and Chloe'' (1951) and ''Ondine'' (1958), in each of which she had created the ballerina role. The remainder he left to his nephew Anthony Russell-Roberts.
 A wide range of Ashton choreography has endured. On Tuesday the Royal Ballet dances his one-act ''Month in the Country'' (1976) in Washington; beginning June 29 American Ballet Theater, which in 2007 danced his ''Dream'' (1964), dances a week of performances of his three-act ''Sylvia'' (1952). Neither 2009 nor 2010 brings any special Ashton anniversary, and not all companies have yet announced their plans for 2009-10, but we already know that the coming season will see stagings of his choreography by both the Royal Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet in Chicago, the Sarasota Ballet and Ballet West in Salt Lake City. These surviving dances range from 1930 to 1985, from three-act ballets to gala divertissements and from pure-dance academic classicism to character-laden narrative comedy.
 But in what shape and in whose hands? Fonteyn died in 1991; she left the bulk of her estate to her brother, Felix, who in turn left it to his daughter, Lavinia Hookham. The two ballets used to be performed exclusively by the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden, and there were doubts about whether they could remain serious without Fonteyn's own interpretations. But not only were both revived in this decade at Covent Garden, ''Ondine'' was also staged by the ballet of La Scala, Milan, and ''Daphnis'' more recently by the Birmingham Royal Ballet. Both ballets have brought Ms. Hookham more royalties in this decade than came her aunt's way. 
 As it happens, Ms. Hookham's role has been admirably passive. She has neither proposed nor made any changes to the ballets; she delegates responsibility for their stagings to those deemed by the Royal Ballet to know best. 
 Another of Ashton's long-term dance friends was Alexander Grant, who created roles in Ashton ballets from 1948 to 1976 and who was staying with Ashton when he died. To him were left ''Facade'' (1931, recently danced by the Sarasota Ballet, among others) and the two-act ''Fille Mal Gardee'' (1960); Ashton himself told me in 1984 that ''Fille'' was the ballet he expected to survive best. 
 Ashton's will was ambiguous about what ownership of the ballets implied. Mr. Grant and Michael Somes, another legatee, assumed that they could take control of how the ballets were danced and who danced them. The dance text of ''Fille,'' as happens with all ballets, underwent a few reaccentuations and adjustments during Ashton's lifetime. Under Mr. Grant's care, however, many more of these emerged, so that by 1994 I was hearing of how the Birmingham Royal Ballet dancers were referring, affectionately but ruefully, to ''Alexander's 'Fille.' ''
 It is a later stage of ''Alexander's 'Fille' '' that was danced by American Ballet Theater in this decade. Mr. Grant is an endearing and beloved figure; it is easy to feel that even while he changes the letter of Ashton's ballets, he is true to their spirit. I didn't see Ballet Theater's ''Fille,'' but I'm happy to hear that it was better than the one by the Royal Ballet at the same time. 
 Still, I don't think it is mere pedantry that makes me fret about the letter of the choreography's being lost. The Royal Ballet and Mr. Grant rely on the use of Benesh dance notation when staging their ballets. In 1997, at the Roehampton conference on revivals and reconstructions of ballet, the notator Michele Braban recounted how she had had to spend so long analyzing the differences among various filmed versions of ''Fille'' that she had finally been required, for sake of economy, simply to record the version currently being danced as the new standard text; this story became more distressing when it emerged that nobody had even given her a copy of Margaret Dale's definitive film of the original ''Fille'' production. 
 Many steps and gestures have demonstrably been altered since Ashton's day; in one recent season at Covent Garden every single ''Fille'' performance seemed to bring the erosion of some further detail. The ballet still pulsates with the tenderness, love and joy that always made it one of the most life-enhancing ballets ever made, but it's being danced in what Shakespeareans might fairly call a Third Quarto edition, with many details of Ashton's finer poetry smudged. And who can be sure that when Mr. Grant is no longer with us, its more lovable qualities will survive?
 Mr. Somes, the main regisseur of the Ashton repertory during Ashton's lifetime and his fiercest loyalist, was left ''Symphonic Variations'' (1946) and the three-act ''Cinderella'' (1948), in both of which he had created the leading male role. Mr. Somes was disgruntled with the Royal Ballet at the time of Ashton's death, so he staged the pure-dance ''Symphonic Variations'' -- which had been exclusively Royal Ballet fare in Ashton's lifetime -- for several other companies, including (in 1992) American Ballet Theater, which has revived it several times since then. 
 This did more good than perhaps even Mr. Somes had anticipated. He had tended to infantilize Royal Ballet dancers in relation to ''Symphonic Variations''; I remember one dancer telling me in 1979 that merely to be admitted to rehearsals for this ballet was like being allowed to see the Holy Grail. But Ballet Theater's dancers brought no excessive reverence to the ballet and restored to it a spontaneity that had long been missing.
 When Mr. Somes died in 1994, he left the ballets to his wife, the former dancer Wendy Ellis, and there is no question that he also gave her his perfectionist zeal. Still, problems arose in 2003, when she commissioned new designs for ''Cinderella,'' with sets by Toer van Shayk and costumes by Christine Haworth that were more pretty-pretty than any of the three versions in Ashton's lifetime. (The Joffrey Ballet, shrewdly, acquired the previous designs, which were by Ashton's longtime colleague David Walker and were part of a production supervised by Ashton only eight months before his death.) 
 Ms. Ellis has a keen eye for dancers: she was the first -- in the 1999 Royal Ballet revival of ''Symphonic Variations'' -- to give a major role to Alina Cojocaru, now a leading exponent of the Ashton style. At its 2005 Covent Garden revival, ''Symphonic Variations'' was looking more radiant than it had since 1977, with audience ovations to match. 
 But Ms. Ellis cannot always make the corps de ballet of ''Stars'' in ''Cinderella'' dance with the attack and pliancy that Ashton demanded, let alone be the best guide to the clowning of the Ugly Sisters, two potentially hilarious but frequently exaggerated drag roles. And what will happen to these ballets when Ms. Ellis can no longer supervise them? 
 Choreography is the most fragile of art forms. The Balanchine repertory was lucky in that, within a few years of his death the Balanchine Trust was established to supervise stagings, and every owner of a Balanchine ballet placed his or her works into the Balanchine Trust's domain (apart from John Taras, who owned ''Symphony in C,'' a work whose text has become controversial). Even in these circumstances there are controversies: the marriage between a company acquiring a Balanchine ballet and the person authorized to stage it is not always fortunate. 
 But the Ashton repertory is in more perilous condition. In 2004 the centenary of Ashton's birth arrived with the long-desired announcement of an Ashton Trust. Certainly this now acts for Lavinia Hookham and the two ballets originally left to Fonteyn; Tony Dyson, to whom Ashton left ''Monotones'' and ''Enigma Variations,'' is the trust's chairman. 
 Just how the Ashton Trust operates is otherwise vague. It seems as yet not to include the ballets now belonging to Alexander Grant and Wendy Ellis Somes. When I have approached a number of international ballet companies about their negotiations to stage or revive an Ashton ballet, none of them has mentioned any dealings with any Ashton Trust. 
 ''La Fille Mal Gardee'' is not the only ballet whose text has been posthumously revised. To whom should I complain about one ruinous change that has been made by the great dramatic ballerina Lynn Seymour to Ashton's ''Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan''? (She stages it next season in Copenhagen.) When dancers of Ashton's 1952 ''Sylvia'' say that the 2004 version -- reconstructed from a film of a 1963 rehearsal -- and its latest revivals feature steps on the downbeat that should be on the upbeat, who will listen? Must we, only 21 years after Ashton's death, settle for Third Quarto versions of ballets that once made him the toast on both sides of the Atlantic?

HEADLINE: Atlanta Is Making Way For New Public Housing

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
In 1936, Atlanta built Techwood Homes, the nation's first housing project. By the 1990s, a greater percentage of the city's residents were living in housing projects -- sprawling red-brick barracks that pockmarked the skyline -- than in any other city in America.
 Now, Atlanta is nearing a very different record: becoming the first major city to knock them all down. By next June, officials here plan to demolish the city's last remaining housing project, fulfilling a long and divisive campaign to reduce poverty by decentralizing it. 
 Mixed-income developments oriented toward families, with trendy shops, golf courses and Y.M.C.A.'s, are emerging where bleak, uniform towers once stood. Displaced residents are receiving vouchers to move to private housing. And a landmark experiment in housing the urban poor in large government-run facilities that began under the New Deal is being undone.
 Over the past 15 years, Atlanta has bulldozed about 15,000 units, spread across 32 housing projects, some of which once contained as many as 2,500 residents.
 ''We've realized that concentrating families in poverty is very destructive,'' said Renee L. Glover, the executive director of the Atlanta Housing Authority. ''It's destructive to the families, the neighborhoods and the city.''
 The elimination of housing projects does not mean the abandonment of public housing. The Atlanta Housing Authority pays for more residents' housing these days than it did in the 1990s. But they are scattered throughout the city in mixed-income communities and private housing financed with vouchers through the government's Section 8 program. 
 Still, critics of the demolitions worry about the toll on residents, who must qualify for vouchers, struggle to find affordable housing and often move to only slightly less impoverished neighborhoods. Especially in a troubled economy, civil rights groups say, uprooting can lead to homelessness if more low-income housing is not made available. Lawsuits have been filed in many other cities, generally without success, that claim that similar relocations violate residents' civil rights and resegregate the poor.
 The federal government has advocated variations of this approach for several decades, particularly since President Bill Clinton began the Hope VI program in the 1990s to disperse residents from centralized projects. Atlanta may be the furthest along, but its plans to demolish buildings, relocate residents and work with private developers to gentrify destitute neighborhoods are being mirrored across the country in cities like Chicago, Detroit, Miami and New Orleans. 
 Over all, 195,000 public housing units have met the wrecking ball across the country since 2006, and over 230,000 more units are scheduled for demolition, according to the Housing and Urban Development Department.
 Atlanta began its demolition effort in 1995 in preparation for the Olympic Games, with the encouragement of local politicians and real estate developers. 
 Only four of the city's housing projects remain, along with 13 smaller public housing facilities, mostly for senior citizens, that the city will continue to operate.
 ''Atlanta's plan signifies in a very clear way that the social contract that cities and citizens have with the poor has fundamentally changed,'' said Sudhir Venkatesh, a sociologist at Columbia University who studies urban neighborhoods. ''We've decided that the market can function to create housing and the role of government should be to move people into the market.''
 Some researchers and policy makers say the model is succeeding. Thomas D. Boston, an economist at the Georgia Institute of Technology who has tracked Atlanta's housing-project residents since 1995, said those who move are more likely to find work, their children were likely to perform better in school and they report higher satisfaction with their living conditions.
 The housing authority says the overwhelming majority of residents support the relocations. But critics say unsuspecting residents are forced into only marginally better neighborhoods. The vouchers, which usually provide families with $568 to $758 per month, according to the housing authority, are not available to residents with certain criminal backgrounds and are often viewed suspiciously by landlords in wealthier communities.
 A large majority of displaced residents settle in 10 of Atlanta's poorest ZIP codes, according to an analysis of housing authority data by Creative Loafing, an alternative newspaper. Only about 20 percent return to their communities once the property becomes a mixed-income development, Mr. Boston said.
 ''Until you have alternative housing that is affordable, available and appropriate, you have no business going into these communities and destroying them,'' said Anita Beaty, the executive director of the Metro Atlanta Task Force for the Homeless. ''To disperse these people without giving them alternatives is wrong.''
 The real winners, Ms. Beaty said, are business developers who make fortunes once the projects are torn down and the neighborhoods gentrify. For years, wealthier Atlantans, frustrated by long commutes, have been moving closer to their jobs downtown and, critics say, displacing poorer residents to outlying suburbs. 
 ''Very much intertwined in all of this is the issue of race,'' said Deirdre Oakley, a professor of sociology at Georgia State University. ''The people being affected are almost all poor African-Americans.''
 A similar complaint could be heard this month after the housing authority held a celebration to mark the destruction of one of its oldest housing projects, Bowen Homes.
 ''What were they clapping about?'' asked Shirley Hightower, a former president of the tenants' association who picketed the demolition. ''Clapping for a demolition? You've had generations behind generations behind generations living in this public housing. This is not a time for celebration.''
 Ms. Glover, the executive director of the housing authority and a former Wall Street lawyer with graduate degrees from Yale and Boston Universities, is the architect of Atlanta's public housing model. She has become well known in housing circles, hailed as visionary by supporters and condemned as ruthless by critics. Ms. Glover -- along with Atlanta's mayor, Shirley Franklin -- was considered by President Obama as a nominee for HUD secretary. 
 Ms. Glover does not blame the social engineers of the 1930s for creating housing projects. Their solution worked during the New Deal, she said, but collapsed as public housing became more racially segregated and attracted drug crime.
 These days, Atlanta is again the vanguard in an experiment that Ms. Glover acknowledged could have unintended consequences. But her greater concern, she said, is that cities will safeguard the status quo.
 ''For us to think that a program that was conceptualized 70 years ago is still the right answer, it makes no sense,'' she said. ''Today is a whole new era.''

HEADLINE: This Summer, Some Galleries Are Sweating

BYLINE: By DOROTHY SPEARS

 BODY:
Postscripts Appended
 IT'S hard to believe that only nine months ago art dealers everywhere were still dreaming up plans for vast multinational expansions. Since September, however, the contemporary art market has careened from boom to bust. Nowhere has that reversal of fortune been more sharply felt than in New York, whose galleries represent the full spectrum of the art world's pecking order. 
 Some two dozen galleries here have folded. The most notable among them -- Clementine, Guild & Greyshkul, Roebling Hall and Rivington Arms -- are midsize galleries, where the reputations of up-and-coming artists first gain traction. 
 Aside from slashing prices or deepening discounts, art dealers across the city have been coping not just by laying off employees but by dropping artists with poor sales records, creating partnerships with other galleries and reaching out in desperation to tried-and-true customers, many of whom were priced out of the market during its peak. Still, with the exception of several blue-chip galleries who show well-known artists, foot traffic in Chelsea and other gallery precincts has thinned markedly where crowds jostled just a year ago. 
 Now, on the heels of the annual Art Basel fair in Switzerland, dealers are bracing for the notoriously quiet summer months. ''Art galleries typically bring in very little revenue from mid-June to October,'' said Josh Baer, founder of the art industry newsletter Baer Faxt, ''which is already pretty tough on the cash flow. But when business is off 50 to 80 percent, one wonders how many galleries will reopen in September.''
 The most recent casualty, the Charles Cowles Gallery, set to close before the end of the month, will leave a gaping storefront on West 24th Street, the heart of the Chelsea gallery district. After 30 years of selling art, Mr. Cowles said in a recent interview, he was ready to retire. But the economic slide left little room for hesitation. ''It's shocking how bad business has been,'' he said. During the big New York auctions last month, he said, ''I didn't see a single major collector in the gallery.''
 Also absent in Manhattan these days are the young Wall Street executives who in flusher times routinely dropped the occasional $10,000 on an artwork. Now it's the wealthiest collectors who are calling the shots. And while they continue to buy, albeit more slowly, they've been taking far fewer risks, favoring bigger galleries, like Gagosian and David Zwirner, whose menu of services ranges from discreet backroom sales to name-brand artists with a long history of museum shows and works in prestigious collections. 
 ''What's going on with the collectors,'' said Roland Augustine, co-owner of the Luhring Augustine Gallery in Chelsea and president of the Art Dealers Association of America, ''is that there's far more selectivity in the buying at all levels.''
 The tougher times have led many dealers to cancel expensive installations and fat, splashy catalogs, keep exhibits running longer, ask artists to cover their own production costs and drastically limit their participation in art fairs, once considered a boon to business. Although the downturn affects everybody, some younger dealers have responded by promoting low-priced artworks and forging collaborative relationships with fellow dealers.
 At Schroeder Romero on West 27th Street, for example, Sara Jo Romero said that Compound Editions, a joint venture founded last fall with the neighboring Winkleman Gallery, offers artworks produced in multiples in the $100 to $300 price range. ''That's been a big success for us,'' Ms. Romero said. ''Also we don't have any employees, and our space is off the beaten track,'' she added, which helps to minimize her gallery's costs.
 Tracy Williams, whose gallery is in the West Village, is also focusing on lower-priced art. Seeing her bottom line plummet in December, Ms. Williams said, she asked a consultant to take a look at her books. After being told, ''This is what you did last year, this is what you're going to do next year, this where you have to cut back,'' she said, she let go one of two full-time employees. 
 She asked her artists to begin covering their own production costs. Then she asked three young curators to recommend emerging artists whose work she could sell -- ideally -- for less than $2,000. Her goal, she said, was ''to show inexpensive work by younger artists'' that would sell and draw attention to the gallery. (The exhibition, ''Tactical Support: Curator's Choice,'' is open through July 31.)
 Cutbacks and bargains on the home front have been accompanied by a vastly reduced presence at foreign art fairs for many dealers.
 Referring to her 18-square-foot booth at Art Basel, Ms. Williams said, ''It's $40,000 before anything's even hanging on the walls.'' On top of standard expenses like airplane tickets, hotel rooms and meals for four or five days, ''you have to pay for all of the light bulbs,'' she said. ''You pay for every outlet. And that's before you even think about framing and transporting the art, or the building of an extra partition.''
 Ms. Williams said she has eliminated all plans to attend art fairs for the remainder of this year. 
 Brent Sikkema, co-owner of the Sikkema Jenkins gallery in Chelsea, said bidding farewell to art fairs has been easy. He participated in five fairs last year. ''We'll never do that again,'' he said.
 ''On the positive side,'' he added, ''art fairs have contributed enormously to the globalization of art. But on the negative side they spawned a culture of shoppers,'' typically newcomers who rarely visit galleries. 
 ''I've said for years, the shoppers will be the first to head for the hills when the market softens,'' he said. ''That has absolutely been the case.''
 If business is far quieter than a year ago, Mr. Augustine, for one, said he takes solace in collectors' renewed focus on gallery programming, as opposed to faddish speculative buying.
 In March, he said, Luhring Augustine mounted the first solo show of the British artist David Musgrave, whose meditative monochromatic drawings and sculptures were priced from $5,000 to $18,000. Everything sold, according to Mr. Augustine: ''Did we make a huge whopping profit or cover our expenses for years to come? No, we did not. But we created a market.''
 More recently, he added, the gallery's eighth show of work by Albert Oehlen sold a single picture for a substantial sum, $375,000, suggesting to Mr. Augustine that ''it's not a complete desert out there.''
 Desert or not Mr. Zwirner appears to have found an oasis at the high end of the market. Yes, he's working six-day weeks, he said in a recent interview. Yes, he has to negotiate arduously to find the perfect collector for very choice pieces of art. But after a dry period of about nine months, he said, ''collectors have been stepping back in, both as buyers and sellers.'' 
 ''The last auction cycle ended the slide,'' he said. ''It really felt for me as if a floor were appearing under our prices.''
 Mr. Zwirner attributed this shift, in part, to clients who are frantically raising cash and negotiating deals privately. ''I don't think anybody was bringing any significant work to the auctions,'' he said. ''In this, galleries are really strengthened right now.''
 That said, he added: ''Collectors are very price conscious. And it is a process.'' 
 In this economy, ''you need two strong legs to stand on,'' he said. ''You need a secondary market with a proven trackrecord that's really focused.'' (Mr. Zwirner's secondary sales cater mostly to Minimalist and Expressionist tastes.) ''And you need artists accepted by the canon of art history.'' 
 ''If you can't define yourself right now,'' he said, ''you're going to get swallowed up, because the ones who do define themselves are going to take all of the business.''
 One could argue that the Chelsea dealer Zach Feuer has defined himself through the painter Dana Schutz, whose work continues to woo institutions and collectors.
 But for dealers representing artists who have yet to achieve big success, the recession has swung like a wrecking ball. And as Mr. Baer noted, dealers once raking in $100 million in sales whose business is now down 75 percent are still in far better shape than those once making $1 million, who are now down to $200,000. With half of a dealer's profits typically going to the artist, he said, ''that doesn't give much room to run a business.''
 As if to prove Mr. Baer's point, on a recent Saturday at the Bellwether Gallery in Chelsea the owner, Becky Smith, stared at the screen of a laptop, her aging Chihuahua mix splayed at her feet. With the bulk of her income generated by five major collectors whose purchases have all but dried up in recent months, Ms. Smith said her current revenues are a mere 20 percent of what they were at the height of the market. She's laid off all of her employees. She's renegotiated her rent.
 ''I've gone at my overhead with a machete,'' she said. Referring to other galleries she considers peers that have already closed, she said, with a wan smile, ''I'm kind of in the perfect sweet spot of misery. 
 ''I might not be open at the end of the summer,'' she acknowledged, ''and it makes me mad.'' 
 ''I bet a lot of great galleries won't be opening in the fall,'' she added, noting that without them a whole generation of voices would be silenced. On Wednesday, she announced that she would be closing her gallery at the end of June. 
 Lisa Spellman, the owner of 303 Gallery, who will be consolidating her headquarters above a vast second space she opened last fall in the center of Chelsea, said: ''What drives me crazy are these cliches that say only the very, very best survive. I don't believe that recessions are Darwinian systems.''
 Postscript: June 20, 2009
 An article this weekend about the economic difficulties facing galleries in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan quotes Becky Smith, owner of Bellwether Gallery, as saying, ''I might not be open at the end of the summer.'' After some copies of the section were printed, Ms. Smith announced that Bellwether was closing at the end of this month.

HEADLINE: 'Transit Cities' Face Roadblocks

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
THE state's emphasis on ''transit-oriented development,'' most particularly with its 10-year-old Transit Village program, has brought transformative change in city after city along commuter rail lines.
 Jersey City, Morristown, New Brunswick and Rahway are among 20 state-designated Transit Village communities in which whole new neighborhoods have been planned, are under way or are almost complete near downtown transit stations.
 By providing planning models and incentives for developers to create mixed-use projects around transit stations, New Jersey has established a national reputation among planners for its ''smart growth'' approach. And for a long time, the program's momentum seemed unstoppable. 
 Then came the roadblock of a severely strained economy. As Jeffrey Otteau, a residential analyst, put it in a recent interview, ''Nothing has been able to escape the economic and financial collapse we've seen over the last year -- transit-oriented development included.'' 
 Work on several large projects has continued. In Morristown, for example, a new 217-unit rental building next to the train station is nearing completion, and leasing begins this week. 
 But work and planning at others have slowed, or even stopped. The area around the rebuilt transit center in Rahway, for instance, is considered a ''shining star'' of Transit Village design, according to Martin E. Robins, a senior fellow at the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University. 
 Yet despite that, and despite downtown Rahway's new identity as a residential and retail center, the area's transformation was halted halfway through. Construction financing dried up last year, and the retail market shriveled, so work on a number of planned condominium buildings with street-level retailing was put off, or else never begun.
 Similarly, in Somerville, work continues on a $153 million upgrade to the Raritan Valley Line train station, but redevelopment of a huge former landfill beside it as a potential Transit Village is one of two stalled projects. 
 ''In today's market, developers won't just show up,'' said Colin Driver, Somerville's director of economic development. ''We made a two-year study, and involved the entire community in creating a great plan for a transit-oriented development -- and then the bottom sort of fell out for any kind of development.''
 The town, which is in Somerset County, had hoped to approve contracts by March 2008. Instead, when it requested proposals from developers last fall, none responded -- even though four had earlier expressed interest.
 Now, Mr. Driver said, the town has decided to act as the primary developer of the land, seeking state financing for landfill cleanup, creating open space, and beginning to install roads and utilities.
 ''The transit-oriented development plan is still alive,'' said Mr. Driver, noting that ground was broken two weeks ago on the new Mass Transit Tunnel under the Hudson River, which will double train capacity and someday make Somerville a ''one-seat commuter town,'' without a change of trains to Manhattan. ''The town is just going to have to take the lead during this time of economic difficulty.''
 Meanwhile, on the other side of the Somerville train station, a second project hasn't had much luck, either. The planned remaking of an old strip mall into a mixed-use center with more than 300 condos, offices and shops had already been stymied for several years by a legal battle with Pathmark, a former tenant, when the developer's bank financing fell apart last fall.
 The town agreed that the developer, Edgewood Properties, could scale back the plan by half -- and it even agreed to provide a construction loan, permitting the developer to borrow against future tax income on the project. But work has yet to begin.
 Is this merely a stumble, or are the projects doomed not to recover their momentum? 
 ''We cannot know that yet,'' Mr. Robins of Rutgers said, ''but they still appear to be the best possible hope for healthy growth in the future.''
 Mr. Otteau, whose company, the Otteau Valuation Group, provides data and analysis to real estate companies, agreed. Even with the downturn, he said, housing values are holding up better in cities with mass transit stations and new development around them. He cited fresh statistics showing that ''transit cities'' were outperforming their counties of residence so far this year:
 In Hudson County, where sales prices are down by 21 percent from last year, they have fallen only 12 percent in Hoboken. 
 In Union County, prices are down by 13 percent over all but have dipped 9 percent in Summit.
 In Monmouth County, prices are down 11 percent, but in Matawan, they are up by 10 percent.
 In Middlesex, prices are down 21 percent, but in Metuchen they have dipped only 11 percent.
 ''Nine of the top 10 housing markets in the state have rail stations,'' Mr. Otteau pointed out in a recent report, adding that ''the new tunnel just increases the appeal of downtown living.''
 Communities around the state continue to apply for Transit Village designation and support. Two weeks ago, Orange became the 20th city to receive Transit Village redevelopment designation for the area around its train station. In addition to Rahway, New Brunswick, Jersey City and Morristown, Orange joined Belmar, Bloomfield, Bound Brook, Burlington, Collingswood, Cranford, Elizabeth, Matawan, Metuchen, Netcong, Pleasantville, Riverside, Rutherford, South Amboy and South Orange. 
 In Somerville, town officials say they continue to work closely with the state on the transit-oriented plan. But a Transit Village designation is not being pursued at this time, Mr. Driver said.

HEADLINE: At Some Campgrounds, 'Roughing It' Means No Espresso

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
AT Smokey Hollow Campground in Lodi, Wis., a typical weekend goes something like this: Families splash around in the man-made ''swimming pond'' -- a lined, sand-bottomed swim zone filled with outsized inflatable toys. Staffers in blue or white T-shirts deliver pizza to tents, RVs and air-conditioned cabins scattered across the grounds. Kids line up for face painting, temporary tattoos, Segway riding clinics and amusement-style rides while parents sip coffee and surf the Web on laptops outside the General Store, where they can also buy firewood for the requisite campfire and hot dog roast. 
 ''Never a dull moment,'' said Kathy Kranz, an office manager from Chicago, who spent this past Memorial Day weekend at the campground with nine other family members, including her 15-year-old son, Jimmy, and her 17-year-old daughter, Krystal.
 At some campgrounds, said Ms. Kranz, who owns a 34-foot motor home with another family, there is ''absolutely nothing to do, except if you want to go fishing.'' But with all the amenities at Smokey Hollow, her family ''just had a ball,'' she said. ''There were so many things to do.'' 
 Getting close to nature and telling ghost stories around a fire are no longer the main attraction at many campgrounds.
 In an effort to attract families -- and charge more -- private campgrounds across the country have been reinventing themselves from sleepy, rustic campsites to bustling ''camp resorts.'' You can still pitch your own tent, but with food delivery, you don't have to slave over an open flame for dinner. 
 ''It's Disneyland for campers,'' said Jim Rogers, the chief executive of Kampgrounds of America, one of the country's oldest operators of private campgrounds, which has been adding free Wi-Fi, espresso bars and air-conditioned cabins to some of KOA's 450 parks. 
 Mr. Rogers likens the evolution of campgrounds in recent years to the amenity creep in the hotel business. Just as hotels have added free cocktail hours, fluffy beds and spas to attract clients and get them to stay longer, he said, campgrounds too have been ''ratcheting up the value'' with new features and services. 
 The Santa Cruz/Monterey Bay KOA in La Selva Beach, Calif., is the home of an espresso bar, but also has miniature-train rides, outdoor movies, a mechanical bull and a giant outdoor Jumping Pillow (sort of a cross between a trampoline and a bouncy castle). 
 In Kimball, Mich., the Port Huron KOA features an in-line skating rink, batting cages, bumper boats, an ice cream parlor and seven playgrounds. 
 And Yogi Bear's Jellystone Park in North Java, N.Y., just added a 16,000-square-foot water playground with water slides, water cannons and other spray features to its long list of kid-oriented attractions. 
 Not unlike hotels, which offer different room types at different prices, private campgrounds have been expanding their lodging options. The Santa Cruz/Monterey Bay KOA, where tent sites cost about $60 a night, has RV sites (from $75), 50 air-conditioned cabins (from $115) and 13 lodges that can sleep six and have a small kitchen, dining area, bathroom and central air and heat (from $225). In April, the campground added six Airstream trailers that sleep a family of four for $150 a night. 
 Also like hotels, KOA introduced its Value Kard Rewards program, last year, allowing repeat campers to earn points redeemable for savings on their next visit. 
 ''We're campers in name only at this point,'' said Bob Mills, a retired firefighter from Stockton, Calif., who parks his 30-foot trailer stocked with, as he puts it, ''every luxury known to man'' at the Santa Cruz/Monterey Bay KOA for a few weeks each summer to spend time with his daughters, Lisa, 15, and Julie, 12.
 After rolling out of their bunks each morning, Lisa and Julie may take a ride on the motorized Fun Train, race around on three-wheeled recumbent bikes or hit the heated swimming pool with friends. In the evening, they'll meet up with Dad for dinner -- pizza delivered straight to their campsite -- and the requisite campfire with s'mores, before turning into their comfy bunk beds inside the trailer.
 All of this may elicit a swift roll of the eyes from hard-core campers, used to pitching a tent deep in the woods and relying purely on nature for entertainment. But the ''camping lite'' travelers offer no apologies. 
 ''I like to camp two hours a day,'' said Scott Crompton, owner of Yogi Bear's Jellystone in North Java. ''Then I retreat into my motor home with every amenity there is.''
 His staff caters to campers like him with a roster of activities, food delivery, people who will park your RV for you and a fleet of golf carts campers can rent for $50 a day to cruise around the 100-acre park. ''Certainly nobody is rubbing two sticks together to make their own fire,'' he said.
 The recent surge in amenities at private campgrounds partly grew out of the rise of the RV business, as ownership grew by 15 percent from 2001 to 2005, with more than eight million households owning a recreational vehicle. As droves of baby boomers snapped up increasingly fancy motor homes over the previous decade, they sought out campsites that could not only handle the increasing need for electricity and water these vehicles required but that also matched the plush interiors of their RVs. 
 Campgrounds soon found out that the more amenities and services they provided, the more they could charge.
 ''The objective is to maximize dollars,'' said Bud Styer, a camping consultant who owns and manages several RV parks and campsites in Wisconsin, including Smokey Hollow. ''If I have 100 sites and I'm charging $10 a night, that's $1,000. If I add an amenity, I can charge $15 more a night. The return on investment is staggering.'' 
 The campsites at Smokey Hollow cost about $45 a night on average and include access to the swimming pond and other water features. Campers can pay an extra $25 a person for a V.I.P. wristband for unlimited weekend use of the miniature golf course, pedal carts, the Jumping Pillow and other amenities. 
 But even at these rates, a weekend of camping can still be more affordable than staying at a hotel or motel -- especially if you cook your own food -- a point the industry expects to bank on during the recession. So far this year, Mr. Styer said, business is up about 12 percent across his four campgrounds. 
 ''When the economy gets a little rough, camping usually gets better,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Plaza Stirs

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
FEW developments rode the wave of high prices in the Manhattan residential real estate the way the 181 condominium apartments at the Plaza Hotel did, and few have chilled as much in the downturn. 
 As it happened, the financial panic on Wall Street last September came just as the Plaza, the city's most expensive condominium conversion ever, per square foot, was hit by a wave of bad publicity. 
 There were complaints that the finishes and details did not live up to the building's luxurious image. A lawsuit by a Russian billionaire who signed up for a $53.5 million penthouse alleged ''bait and switch'' tactics. The suit and a countersuit by the Plaza were later settled. 
 Several buyers closed on apartments, but put them back on the market after barely a walk-through, including a gallery owner who bought five apartments, the Frank Lloyd Wright Suite among them, for $49.2 million, and promptly put them in the recycling bin.
 Since then, inventory has been growing, and little has been selling. There are now about 30 listings at the Plaza, with a total asking price of more than $250 million. A review of property records as of last week shows that only one resale has closed since September 2008, a sharp reversal of fortune for a building that sometimes had two or three sponsor closings in a single day. 
 In May, a seventh-floor apartment sold for $8 million, more than 8 percent below the original $8.74 million price. A sponsor-owned unit also sold in May for $11.8 million. In the last few weeks, after price cuts and the public's reacquaintance with the Oak Room and other long-closed public spaces at the Plaza, activity has picked up, brokers say, and a handful of deals have been done. 
 Carrie Chiang, a broker at the Corcoran Group with two apartments in contract at the Plaza, said buyers had begun to realize that despite the building's ''bad press,'' it was ''New York's trophy, a building that nobody can ever build again.'' She said her apartments were selling because they had the ''bargain prices'' in the building. ''If you buy low,'' she said, ''the value can only go higher.'' 
 She has just knocked more than $4 million off the price of two apartments on the fourth floor, including a $3 million cut in the asking price for the four-bedroom 4,000-square-foot Frank Lloyd Wright Suite. It is now priced at $18.5 million, down 28 percent from the $25.7 million asking price of last year and 14 percent from the $21.5 million sales price set in a contract signed in March 2006. 
 The Plaza, which is on Central Park South and Fifth Avenue, and 15 Central Park West, a new building a few blocks away at West 62nd Street, were the standout buildings at the height of the real estate boom, status symbols for multimillionaires. In the first quarter of 2008, closings at the two buildings drove the average condominium sale price in Manhattan up by 22 percent, to a record of more than $1.9 million, a level that may not be matched again for decades. 
 But since then, their fortunes have diverged. Despite the downturn, eight apartment resales at 15 Central Park West have closed since mid-September 2008, though only one so far in 2009.
 Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., said that at the peak, sales at the two buildings ''fed off each other,'' driving prices ever higher. He said that sales over the next two years would establish which building will hold its value better. ''The early signs are showing that 15 Central Park West has more interest,'' he said.
 A 17th-floor apartment at the Plaza was listed in contract last week. It was owned by Oscar Schafer, a managing partner at O.S.S. Capital Management. Mr. Schafer closed on the three-bedroom apartment for $14.6 million in June 2008, and put it on the market the next month for $18 million. By the time it went into contract, the asking price was $12.5 million. The sale price was not disclosed.
 Roger Erickson, a broker at Sotheby's International Realty, has one of the most expensive listings at the Plaza, the Astor Suite, with an asking price of $38 million, down from $55 million last year. After no buyer interest in the apartment for months, he said, several potential buyers, including one from Russia and one from Brazil, have come through. ''The negative publicity really put a cloud over the building,'' he said. ''We are seeing the sun through the clouds.''

HEADLINE: Campari? Crostini? Step Into My Umbrian Estate

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER. 
HELENE COOPER is the White House correspondent for The New York Times and the author of ''The House at Sugar Beach: In Search of a Lost African Childhood'' (Simon & Schuster).

 BODY:
IT is not exactly my olive oil estate. But it feels like mine. Because every July, when daylight stretches across the Umbrian landscape until 9:30 p.m. and the smell of fresh figs -- roasted with Gorgonzola, wrapped in prosciutto, of course -- wafts from the villa's two kitchens, you can find me, glass of prosecco in hand, holding court with my friends at the top of my own little mountain.
 I play the gracious hostess, inviting an ever expanding group of friends to join me at my estate outside Perugia every year. I rattle off directions to my mountaintop with cool precision. ''From Fiumicino, it's about two hours,'' I say authoritatively. ''Once you pass Deruta on the E47, exit at Torgiano. Follow the gravel road to the top of the mountain. Oh, and bring wine.'' 
 I'm so at home that I invite the real owner of the Montagnola estate, Vittoria Iraci Borgia, along with Carmela Guzzo, her factotum-cum-culinary-magician, and their families to elaborate multicourse feasts. When they arrive, bearing lovely gifts for the hostess, my friends and I sweep out to welcome them, the picture of gracious beneficence. We proffer Campari-vodka-grapefruit juice aperitivos, along with crostini alla Romana and arancini before moving on to the main feast as the sun starts to set. 
 Global recession? What global recession? If you don't count discretionary spending (read eight pairs of shoes from the Prada outlet in Montevarchi), my dolce vita sojourn is cheaper than a week at many beach houses stateside. For 2,400 euros (about $3,400 at $1.42 to the euro) for the whole week, we rent the six-bedroom (each with private bathroom) Caprareccia, the simply furnished, staggeringly beautiful hilltop jewel of La Montagnola's rental offerings. 
 Umbria is to Tuscany what Sonoma is to Napa -- a little less trafficked, a little less touristy, a lot less money. It is dotted with historic cities and towns, from the imperious, intellectual Perugia, to the spiritual and high-minded Assisi, to the wine-lover's paradise, Montefalco, home of sagrantino di Montefalco, one of Italy's finest and most robust red wines. 
 The region also has a number of beautiful, yet simple and rustic agriturismi (farm rentals) that are available by the day or by the week. These range from rooms in farmhouses to large villas on vineyards to country house estates, like mine. They are, by and large, far less expensive than a hotel, with the added benefit of the freedom to sleep late and eat breakfast when you want, shop in the local markets for artichokes and try your hand at Italian cooking in your own kitchen. It's a great way to play house (well, play villa) with friends.
 I found my own villa back in 2003, through Vittoria's cooking class at La Montagnola, her family's 1,500-acre olive oil estate 15 minutes south of Perugia. It was a gloriously hot day, and we made stuffed tomatoes, white pizza in a wood-burning oven, and biscotti. The rest, as we say in Italy, is la storia.
 After the class, Vittoria took us up a gravel road. We bounced past row after row of olive trees, their jade-tinged branches brushing against the car. Around a bend, a picnic table sat awaiting the olive pickers who would be coming at harvest. The landscape felt like a nature preserve. Finally, at the top the mountain, we arrived at Caprareccia. 
 I stepped out of the car, mouth agape. Two peacocks were strutting to the far end of the swimming pool, pondering the panorama before them: gently undulating olive hills, a medieval castle in the distance, a scattering of sienna-tiled rooftops, the spires of Assisi in the distance. Behind the pool stood Caprareccia, its windowed shutters closed to keep its rooms cool in the warm midday sunshine.
 A hedgehog scurried between two rosemary bushes before disappearing. ''How much?'' I croaked. Vittoria's reply -- 2,400 euros, or 400 euros per bedroom for a whole week -- had me babbling instantly: 
 ''I'll take it,'' I said. ''Sign me up for next year. First week of July. The whole house. It's mine, you hear?''
 And mine it has been. Every year, my friends and I uncover a little more of the shine of our mountain and valley and the area's towns. Last year we discovered that the deli section in the hypermarket in San Martino has roasted pigs, which when enjoyed with a crisp Orvieto Classico on a picnic table back at our villa, can go a long way toward helping one uncover the meaning of life.
 We have learned the best restaurant for dinner with a view -- the hilltop Osteria I Birbi, just outside Torgiano, where we can sample bistecca alla Fiorentina on the patio. The best drive: along Lago Trasimino through San Savino at sunset. We investigate just about every single zucchero bowl that Deruta, the heart of Italy's pottery industry, has to offer, and then decide that, actually, we prefer the sugar bowls at the pottery place in Torgiano, the village down the mountain from La Montagnola. 
 We take day trips: hillside drives to Montefalco for sagrantino, Montalcino for brunello, and even to Torgiano, where the Lungarotti vintners turn out the easy-drinking Rubesco Rosso di Torgiano. We walk down to the village for ciabatta and pecorino, to visit the butcher for pork chops, and then call whoever is back at the house to come get us in the car for the trip back up the mountain. I quickly learned to keep the car in first gear for the whole steep ascent. 
 We take evening trips: aromatic drives to Foligno for dinner at Il Bacco Felice, where we sample deep-fried rabbit and whole chicken cooked in what tasted to me like bacon fat. Sometimes we're bold, and venture to Siena, an hour away, to sip Campari and fresh orange juice in the famous Il Campo piazza, or to Florence, two hours away, to visit David and haggle in the leather market. We make multiple trips to the Prada outlet; after all, can one really have enough shoes?
 More often we idle the days and nights away on our private mountaintop, patio loungers scattered on the lawn around the pool, chilled wine resting on the side tables Vittoria has fashioned out of tree stumps. We watch the sun arc across the sky, listening to the sound of utter quiet. 
 We all love our Italian host. The guys love her because, well, she's a hot blond Italian. The girls love her because she tells us where to find the spectacular Brunello Cucinelli cashmere outlet in Solomeo, or the La Perla outlet on the road to Assisi. We also quickly try to copy her style, and glide around in tight tank tops, flowy linen palazzo pants and flat sandals. 
 And we love our estate's olive oil. ''Taste this one,'' Vittoria said during a tasting last year. 
 I sipped the cup. ''It tastes salty,'' I said. 
 Vittoria sniffed, dismissively. ''Yes, that one is from Croatia, so it tastes like the sea. Me, I think olive oil should taste like olives.'' She handed me another small cup of olive oil, this one from La Montagnola. 
 I sniffed, then tasted. It was fruity and spicy, triggering every memory I have of my yearly stays on the top of my Umbrian mountain. 
 And yes, it tasted like olives. 
 A VILLA FOR A DAY
 To find the agriturismi, or farm rentals, of Umbria, check rental Web sites like www.agriturismo.net amd www.agriturismoevacanzeverdi.it . Rooms are available in a wide range of prices and amenities: a simple room in a farmhouse may be as little as 250 euros a week (about $355 at $1.42 to the euro); a well-appointed villa may run 7,000 euros or more. Most of these places are self-catering, so expect to do your own grocery shopping and cooking, although some of the more upscale places can provide in-house cooks. Housekeeping arrangements vary from daily (rare) to weekly (more common). 
 Weekly prices for accommodations at La Montagnola (Via Roma, 11, Torgiano; 39-075-9880048; www.lamontagnola.it) range from 180 euros for a double bedroom in a farmhouse with a swimming pool and shared kitchen during low season (October to April) to 2,500 euros during August for the six-bedroom mountaintop house called Caprareccia. Vittoria Iraci Borgia's cooking classes, at La Montagnola, are 70 euros for a half-day session, with lunch. Information on how to reserve is on the La Montagnola Web site. 
 The cities and towns of Umbria offer a number of dining options, from simple country trattorias to full-blown seven-course restaurants. At Il Bacco Felice (Via Garibald, 73-75, Foligno; 39-393-8668407; www.ilbaccofelice.it), dinner for two with wine is about 100 euros. Osteria I Birbi (Miralduolo; 39-075-9889041), in Torgiano, offers about 15 kinds of steak, along with rustic soups like cannellini and mushroom. Dinner for two with wine costs about 100 euros.
 To reach the Prada outlet in Montevarchi, take the Montevarchi exit from the A1 autostrada and follow the signs to ''centro'' and Localita Levanella. The sign on the store doesn't say Prada; it says ''Space.''

HEADLINE: Can Governments Till the Fields of Innovation?

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
INNOVATION -- the tricky, many-step process by which ideas become products and services -- has typically been seen, studied and celebrated at the micro level, as a pursuit for entrepreneurs and clever companies.
 But governments are increasingly wading into the innovation game, declaring innovation agendas and appointing senior innovation officials. The impetus comes from two fronts: daunting challenges in fields like energy, the environment and health care that require collaboration between the public and private sectors; and shortcomings of traditional economic development and industrial policies.
 Innovation policy, to be sure, is an emerging discipline. It lacks crisp definitions or metrics. The most explicit embrace of it has been outside the United States, though the Obama administration is taking some initial steps. Its new budget directs the Bureau of Economic Analysis to develop statistics that ''uniquely measure the role of innovation'' in the economy. And the government's new chief technology officer, Aneesh Chopra, speaks of building ''innovation platforms'' to spur growth. 
 The rising worldwide interest in innovation policy represents the search to answer an important question: What is the appropriate government role in creating industries and jobs in today's high-technology, global economy?
 That central issue animated much of the discussion at an unusual gathering earlier this month at a lodge north of San Francisco. This invitation-only affair was organized and moderated by John Kao, a former professor at Harvard Business School and founder of the Large Scale Innovation. 
 A few speakers covered big-think issues like climate-altering geoengineering and water-management technologies. But the main participants were innovation-policy practitioners from nine countries: Australia, Brazil, Britain, Chile, Colombia, Finland, India, Norway and Singapore. 
 The meeting offered a window onto the state of innovation policy -- how it is being defined, and what countries are doing. Above all, innovation policy is an attempt to bring some coordination to often disparate government initiatives in scientific research, education, business incentives, immigration and even intellectual property.
 ''It's about setting an agenda and helping build a portfolio of skills that let an economy and a society move forward in smarter, faster ways,'' Mr. Kao said.
 Yet if the reach of innovation policy is broad, the attendees agreed, it is best done with a lighter touch than industrial policies of the past, which often focused on specific companies for government support. They used metaphors like ''impresario'' and ''orchestra conductor'' to describe government's role. The ideal, they said, is ''stewardship,'' not command and control.
 In Britain, a national innovation agenda is beginning to take shape with policy documents and the creation of a Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. ''We're determined not to second-guess the future by trying to pick winners and losers,'' said Philip Rycroft, a senior government official overseeing innovation policy. ''But we do think government can create the conditions so that new industries can rise more easily.''
 Finland has long taken a comprehensive approach to innovation policy, investing in areas as varied as an outstanding national education system and high-speed Internet connections for its residents. It has also produced a power in the cellphone industry, Nokia.
 But Mikko Kosonen, president of the Finnish Innovation Fund, a public investment fund, says Finland now needs an ''innovation policy 2.0'' to climb the economic ladder to remain competitive. ''We see value migrating to software and services,'' he explained.
 The country has the second-fastest-aging society in the world, after Japan, and its health care costs are rising rapidly. To turn that challenge into a growth engine, Finland intends to become a global leader in developing software and services for medical monitoring and preventive health services. ''We think well-being services are the next big opportunity for Finland,'' said Mr. Kosonen, a former senior executive at Nokia. 
 Other governments are also focusing on targets of potential advantage. In Australia, the government is looking to nurture industries that arise from its harsh climate and a scattered population. So research centers are working to improve strains of drought-resistant wheat and cotton for export as adaptive technologies to cope with climate change, said Terry Cutler, who recently headed a government-appointed expert panel on innovation in Australia. And Boeing last year selected Australia as the location for a Phantom Works lab for developing unmanned aircraft, he said.
 ''Test flights don't bump into things,'' he said. ''Sparsity can be a global competitive advantage.''
 In India, the government and industry have financed research into products and services that reverse the traditional pattern of innovation flowing gradually from wealthy nations to the rest of the world, said R. A. Mashelkar, chairman of the country's National Innovation Foundation. Early evidence of the trend, he said, includes the $2,000 Nano automobile, and low-cost drugs for tuberculosis and psoriasis.
 ''If you make something for the rich, the poor cannot afford it,'' Mr. Mashelkar said. ''But if you design for the poor, everyone can afford it.''
 CLEARLY, the innovation meeting in California was a gathering of enthusiasts. One view not heard was that innovation policy itself is a mistake -- government meddling in decisions best left to the marketplace -- as free-market purists contend.
 Lars Aukrust, executive director for innovation at the Research Council of Norway, answered that criticism by comparing a nation with a large corporation. ''If you are going to run a big company,'' he said, ''are you going to leave it all to serendipity or make some strategic choices?''
 ''Innovation policy is a probability game,'' Mr. Aukrust added. ''You can improve the odds of success.''

HEADLINE: A Factory For Words In a Sea Of Debt

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A factory in New York has vanished. The door is locked and the lights are out. The phone rings and rings. No one answers. The promised checks are not in the mail, and a small army of workers, owed hundreds of thousands of dollars, scramble to pay the rent and buy groceries. 
 This factory was Inkwell Publishing Solutions, and the widgets it made were the innards of textbooks -- the sentences and pictures, chapter headings and study guides, all written and designed to the specifications of education panels in big states like Texas and California and New York. The states buy their books from publishing houses like Houghton Mifflin Harcourt that hire Inkwell and similar companies, called book developers, to assemble the parts. 
 And Inkwell, on West 27th Street, hired freelancers like Taylor Baxter, 28, to execute the mission of providing a language arts book for fifth graders in San Antonio, and to keep the multibillion-dollar textbook industry chugging along. Inkwell, Mr. Baxter says, has not paid him more than $10,000. ''I owe the I.R.S. over $4,000,'' he said. ''My credit card is days from being frozen. I am two months late on rent. I have $100 in cash.''
 Mr. Baxter is one of about 50 unpaid freelance writers, editors, page designers and others who worked this year for Inkwell on textbooks that are to be published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, which is owned by a holding company based in the Cayman Islands, and floats in oceans of debt.
 ''The explanation I have been given is that Houghton Mifflin Harcourt owes Inkwell money,'' Mr. Baxter said. More than 30 freelancers who were interviewed by phone or e-mail told the same story: Inkwell stopped paying them for work on textbooks, claiming that Houghton had stopped paying it. 
 Jan Kraus, owed $6,000, has dropped her health insurance. Jennifer Mallow, who is due $3,100 and says she is lucky to survive with extra night shifts at Macy's, now budgets her subway trips and frets when it is time to do the laundry. Gini Dustin, owed $11,000, is behind on apartment maintenance fees. Phil Opatz has maxed out his credit cards and has discovered that unemployment benefits are based on how much he was actually paid, not what he billed. ''Without the pay stubs for the $10,000 that is owed me, I hardly made enough to qualify,'' Mr. Opatz said.
 The opening pages of any respectable textbook include pictures of distinguished professors and authorities on reading or biology or whatever the subject is. They look like the people who wrote the thing, but are actually human brand nameplates. In the real world, the books are written and edited by faceless workers in textbook factory towns like New York.
 ''Sometimes it's writing,'' said Patrick Egan, an editor who worked at Inkwell and is owed $3,712. ''But it's more like engineering or mechanical work -- trying to make the textbook program fit the way the state wants it.'' 
 Mr. Egan said that after he left Inkwell in late January, he went to work at another book development company, and is owed about $13,000 there, also for work done on Houghton textbooks. 
 And what of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt? The company did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday and Friday. Led by Barry O'Callaghan, an Irish businessman, the company has been under pressure from ratings agencies, which were critical of the debt it was carrying from mergers. 
 Houghton stands in the same distant place from its products as Wal-Mart did in 1996, when a factory on West 38th Street stopped paying the workers who made the Kathie Lee Gifford clothing line for the retailer. This is outsourcing, like making superstar sneakers in China and stitching soccer balls in Pakistan on behalf of far-off conglomerates.
 ''The publishing houses produce practically nothing,'' said Mr. Egan, the editor. ''They depend on development houses for almost all their products.''
 That would be places like Inkwell, which is owned by Israel Luzunaris and Patricia Cooke. Mr. Luzunaris did not respond to a message left on his voice mail. Ms. Cooke, who also is the company's president, did not think the unpaid people from her factory warranted any attention.
 ''What business is this of yours?'' she asked. ''I'm not going to say anything about any of our clients.'' 
 Hadn't she written an e-mail message to the freelancers on April 1 saying, ''We, especially Brian, are doing everything possible to get payments from Harcourt. They have been very slow to make the payments that they owe us.''
 Yes, she said, she had written the message. But to quote it, she said, would be ''disgusting.''
 No doubt.

LENGTH: 1020 words

HEADLINE: A Detroit Hybrid That Hums ...

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
FOR the next few hundred words, I am going to detail all the great attributes of the 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid and explain why you might want to buy such an economical car with so many cool features. Then I'm going to explain why you will probably ignore me and decide not to buy one.
 First, let's talk fuel economy: it is stellar for a car this large and useful. The Environmental Protection Agency rates the Fusion Hybrid at 41 miles a gallon in the city, 36 on the highway and 39 in combined driving. That is an incredible 8 m.p.g. better than the similar-size Toyota Camry Hybrid in city driving and 2 m.p.g. better on the highway. 
The Fusion Hybrid is also refined and comfortable. Like most of today's hybrids it combines a gasoline engine with electric motors, but it drives and performs pretty much like a conventional car, without many of the quirks -- squishy brakes, abrupt power transitions, odd noises -- that hybrid owners take for granted. 
 Indeed, the new gas-electric Fusion is not only a standout among hybrids, it may well share honors -- with the redesigned 2010 Toyota Prius -- as the most well-rounded hybrids yet. At last, consumers have a choice of no-excuses hybrids that leave little to be desired.
 What message does this Detroit-bred standout send us about the beleaguered American auto industry -- you know, the one that reportedly can't build high-mileage cars, the one that supposedly can't compete with foreigners or take a lead in high technology, the one whose hybrids are routinely dismissed as years behind Honda's and Toyota's? 
 Perhaps the Fusion Hybrid suggests that Ford, the only Detroit automaker to decline a government handout, really can deliver the advanced fuel-saving technology that it has been promising for years. (Remember Bill Ford's unfulfilled pledge to raise the mileage of S.U.V.'s by 25 percent by 2005? )
 The Fusion Hybrid and its mechanically identical cousin, the Mercury Milan Hybrid -- which, for simplicity's sake, I won't mention again -- sit atop the midsize hybrid segment. All right, that's true only if you don't count the redesigned 2010 Toyota Prius hatchback, which recently went on sale and is rated at 51 m.p.g. in the city. (The Prius is smaller, but because its interior volume has expanded a bit, the new model is classified as a midsize car by the E.P.A.) But beating the Camry Hybrid is what really matters to Ford. The less capable (and recently suspended) Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid was never really in the game.
 The Fusion Hybrid is powered by a 156-horsepower 4-cylinder 2.5-liter Atkinson cycle gasoline engine mated to a continuously variable transmission without fixed gears. The electric boost from two battery-driven motors raises net horsepower to 191, compared with 187 for the Camry Hybrid.
 The system is similar to the one in the Escape Hybrid, but is tweaked to produce 20 percent more power from its nickel-metal-hydride battery pack. Variable timing for the engine's intake cam helps the system transition fairly seamlessly (no clunks!) between electric and gas modes.
 While most hybrids can operate on electric power alone only up to about 25 miles an hour, the Fusion Hybrid can be coaxed up to 47 m.p.h. before the gas engine kicks in. But all-electric mode will take you only a mile or so before the batteries need a recharge.
 In my test-driving, I was able to beat the mileage estimates for both city and highway by 3 to 5 miles a gallon. But the Fusion Hybrid proved less capable of racking up the hypermile-type numbers (65 to 70 m.p.g.) that I managed through careful manipulation of the new Prius and the 2010 Honda Insight. Ford seems to have engineered the Fusion Hybrid for consistent mileage in real-world conditions, rather than the stellar results that can be obtained only from gimmicky driving techniques.
 Outside, to differentiate the Hybrid from other Fusions, there is a small road-and-leaf badge and multispoke 17-inch wheels. Inside, the Hybrid has distinctive displays meant to coach a driver toward better economy. Gauge-minders are rewarded with mileage, like mine, that can exceed E.P.A. ratings. But some people may tire of the driving style required to achieve the best results, reverting back to their old, fuelish jackrabbit starts and abrupt stops. 
 The gauge screens can be configured to show different levels of information, including fuel use, battery power, average economy and instantaneous m.p.g. There's also an animation of vines that grow representational leaves as the driver's efficiency improves. 
 But beyond the array of economy readouts, the Fusion Hybrid can masquerade as a regular car. 
 Despite its 3,805-pound curb weight, the car accelerates from a stop to 60 m.p.h. in a little more than eight seconds. Though the chassis is tuned toward providing a cushy, Crown Victoria-caliber ride, the Fusion Hybrid is reasonably responsive and still entertaining to drive. That is refreshing among hybrids, because most in the genre sacrifice driving fun on the altar of minimalism.
 That reminds me: an eco-friendly fabric seat made from recycled materials is standard.
 Heated leather seating is an option, but if you start adding upgrades like that, along with a sunroof, a powerful stereo and a navigation system, the price zooms from $27,995 to more than $33,000.
 Without all the budget-busting extras, Ford notes that the Hybrid costs about $3,300 more than a comparable gasoline model, the 4-cylinder Fusion SEL. Consider not only the price but the economy, too. The gas-only Fusion also gets impressive mileage; the Fusion S's 34 m.p.g. highway rating is just 2 m.p.g. less than the hybrid. Do you drive enough in the city to foresee a payoff from the hybrid's higher urban mileage (41 m.p.g. vs. 23 for the gasoline 4-cylinder)?
 Therein lies the dilemma that may keep potential customers out of the Fusion Hybrid. There are cheaper hybrids and even some, like the Prius, that get better mileage. But the Fusion Hybrid's worst enemy could turn out to be the conventional Fusion, which offers many of the same attributes for less money.

HEADLINE: An Improbable Cradle of Rock Music

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY. 
E-mail: streetscapes @nytimes.com

 BODY:
NOW it is cloaked in white netting, its movie-set facade as secret as the fraternal society that built it in 1927. But later this summer the ghostly renovation wrapping will come off the spectacular Pythian Temple, at 135 West 70th Street, one of the greatest productions by the theater architect Thomas Lamb. 
 The Knights of Pythias was founded in 1864, taking the name from the legendary friendship of Damon and Pythias. 
 Fraternal orders flourished after the Civil War, and by the 1910s and '20s, the Elks, the Knights of Columbus, the Masons and other organizations felt the need for huge lodges, sometimes with hotel rooms. One of these is the Level Club of the Masons, on 73rd Street west of Broadway, Romanesque in style with a cascade of setbacks, completed in 1927.
 The Pythians completed their high-rise house that same year. About 150 feet tall, it was built mostly in buff brick and terra cotta. Sprinkled over the surface is some of the most brilliant polychrome terra cotta in New York, but because it is hidden away on a narrow side street, many veteran New Yorkers have never seen it. 
 The Pythians had an eye for drama, and hired Lamb, a Scottish-born specialist in magnificent movie palaces. The architect created a blockbuster synthesis of Egyptian, Babylonian and Assyrian motifs evoking the grandeur of D. W. Griffith's Babylonian movie set for his 1916 ''Intolerance.''
 Lamb's $2 million center, to be shared by the 120 smaller lodges in the city, had 13 lodge rooms, a gym on the roof and bowling and billiards in the basement. Lamb was fortunate that the lodge rooms did not require windows, and the plain walls gave his structure a brute strength rare in architecture. 
 The Pythian Temple's ground-floor colonnade, with Assyrian-type heads, is centered on a brilliantly glazed blue terra-cotta entry pavilion. The windowless middle section steps back at about 100 feet up, with four seated Pharaonic figures similar to those of Ramses II at Abu Simbel. Two more setbacks rise to a highly colored Egyptian-style colonnade, and to giant urns carried by teams of yellow, red and green oxen. In a rendering, the urns are lighted with fires. 
 Published photographs of the lobby show a double-height space in what appears to be polished black marble, with Egyptian decor, like a winged orb, or perhaps Isis, over the doorway. 
 Various organizations rented space at the temple, including, in 1928, the Women's 13 Club, whose dinner there featured spilled salt, smashed mirrors and ladders to walk under. 
 In 1930, the Level Club went into foreclosure, but the Pythian Temple had a more solid foundation. Indeed, in 1932 The New York Times reported that the trustees planned to turn over the operating profits to unemployment relief. That doesn't quite square with a 1940 tax exemption case in New York State Supreme Court, which found that the temple had had no net income since the day it opened. The clubhouse was then valued at $625,000. 
 Nevertheless, the Pythians somehow hung on, renting space to Decca Records. In 1954, Bill Haley and His Comets recorded ''Rock Around the Clock'' there, and Buddy Holly, Sammy Davis Jr., Billie Holiday and others are also said to have used the studio. 
 In November 1956, the singer and actor Paul Robeson spoke at the temple at a meeting of the National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association, and according to The Times ''hailed the achievements of the Soviet Union.'' He and others leaving the building, including clueless Pythians, were bombarded with eggs, tomatoes and other missiles by protesters incensed by the brutal Communist suppression of the Hungarian revolt only days before. 
 The Pythians departed in 1958, leaving behind halberds, staffs, magic wands, coffins with skeletons, lanterns, thrones and Egyptian garb, The Times reported. The grand structure was bought by the New York Institute of Technology. 
 In the early 1980s, the architect David Gura oversaw a radical conversion of the Pythian Temple into apartments, a devilishly complicated alteration because of large beams, the windowless facade, and double-height lodge and other rooms. He inserted banks of windows into the facade as gently as possible, and added greenhouse-type structures on the upper terraces. 
 The white netting, put up for a facade restoration project by Luke LiCalzi Engineers, should come down by the end of July. Then, the Pythian Temple will rock the block again.

HEADLINE: Warrior on Poverty

BYLINE: By MAURICE ISSERMAN. 
Maurice Isserman is a professor of history at Hamilton College and the author of ''The Other American: The Life of Michael Harrington.''

 BODY:
If there is a heaven, and it has a place for virtuous skeptics, I imagine Michael Harrington is looking down, amused by the recent cover of Newsweek proclaiming, ''We Are All Socialists Now,'' not to mention Newt Gingrich's lament that the United States is seeing ''European socialism transplanted to Washington.'' Back in the 1960s, Harrington had some experience trying to ''transplant'' some socialist ideas to Washington -- and the results were rather different from what he had hoped.
 Fifty years ago this July, Commentary magazine (at the time a journal of bracingly liberal sentiments) ran Harrington's article ''Our Fifty Million Poor,'' in which he sought to overturn the conventional wisdom that the United States had become an overwhelmingly middle-class society. Using the poverty-line benchmark of a $3,000 annual income for a family of four, he demonstrated that nearly a third of the population lived ''below those standards which we have been taught to regard as the decent minimums for food, housing, clothing and health.'' 
 Harrington's own knowledge of poverty was decidedly secondhand. Born in 1928 in St. Louis and educated at Holy Cross, Yale Law School and the University of Chicago, he moved to New York City in 1949 to become a writer. In 1951 he joined Dorothy Day's Catholic Worker movement as a volunteer at its soup kitchen. Within a few years he left the Catholic Worker (and the Roman Catholic Church) and joined the Young People's Socialist League, the youth affiliate of the battered remnants of the American Socialist Party.
 In researching the Commentary essay, Harrington picked up the notion of the ''culture of poverty,'' a casual bit of intellectual borrowing with fateful consequences. The phrase was coined by the anthropologist Oscar Lewis, who contended that being poor was not simply a condition marked by the absence of wealth; rather, poverty created ''a subculture of its own,'' and those raised within it were unlikely to escape. However different their places of origin, he argued, poor people in Mexico might have more in common with their counterparts in New York than with better-off people from their own countries. 
 Echoing Lewis, Harrington argued that American poverty constituted ''a separate culture, another nation, with its own way of life.'' He elaborated on this idea in ''The Other America: Poverty in the United States,'' published in the spring of 1962. It was a short work with a simple thesis: poverty was both more extensive and more tenacious than most Americans assumed. An ''invisible land'' of the poor existed in rural isolation or in crowded slums where middle-class visitors seldom ventured. ''That the poor are invisible is one of the most important things about them,'' Harrington wrote. ''They are not simply neglected and forgotten. . . . What is much worse, they are not seen.''
 Harrington argued that poor Americans were ''people who lack education and skill, who have bad health, poor housing, low levels of aspiration and high levels of mental distress. . . . And if one problem is solved, and the others are left constant, there is little gain.'' Instead of relying on a rising tide of affluence to lift all boats, he argued, America needed a broad program of ''remedial action'' -- a ''comprehensive assault on poverty.'' 
 Harrington said he would be happy if ''The Other America'' sold 2,500 copies. Instead, it sold 70,000 within a year (and well over a million in successive editions). Among the book's readers, reputedly, was John F. Kennedy, who in the fall of 1963 began thinking about proposing antipoverty legislation. After Kennedy's assassination, Lyndon Johnson took up the issue, calling in his 1964 State of the Union address for an ''unconditional war on poverty.'' Sargent Shriver headed the task force charged with drawing up the legislation, and invited Harrington to Washington as a consultant.
 In February 1964 Harrington helped write a background paper, working with the radical writer Paul Jacobs and a Labor Department aide named Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an old drinking partner from the Greenwich Village days. The memo argued that ''if there is any single dominant problem of poverty in the U.S., it is that of unemployment.'' The solution was a return to the model of the New Deal, creating massive public works projects to end unemployment and redistribute income to those most in need.
 But of what relevance was the concept of the ''culture of poverty'' if all that was needed to counter it was jobs? In ''The Other America,'' Harrington used the concept interchangeably with ''vicious circle of poverty'' -- by which he meant poor living conditions leading to poor health, poor attendance at school or work, and so on. Nothing in this ''vicious circle'' was culturally rooted in the sense that Oscar Lewis had argued -- so at any point additional income would suffice to break the circle.
 Jobs programs, however, were expensive: the Works Progress Administration had cost $5 billion in 1936, and Johnson had made it clear that appropriations for his ''unconditional'' war on poverty had to be brought in under a billion dollars for the coming year. The strategy was to help the poor to improve themselves -- a ''hand up, not a handout,'' as Shriver put it. The resulting legislation, passed in August 1964, provided funds for preschool education, community action agencies, legal services and the like, but did little directly to provide jobs and income for the poor. 
 Harrington's active involvement with the war on poverty came to an end after his month of consulting. But Moynihan continued to fight for their alternate strategy from his Labor Department post. His famous 1965 position paper, ''The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,'' better known as the Moynihan Report, was bitterly attacked from the left for describing the urban black family as a ''tangle of pathology.'' Less noted was his continued advocacy of an expanded federal jobs program.
 Indeed, that aspect of Moynihan's and Harrington's thinking was roundly rejected by the group of thinkers who ultimately carried the day on poverty. In the 1970s, neoconservatives -- former liberals disillusioned with the welfare state (Harrington himself popularized the term in a 1973 article) -- neatly turned the argument of ''The Other America'' on its head, arguing that welfare programs only strengthened the culture of poverty by encouraging single-parent families and discouraging work. The poor, in their view, would be better served by dismantling the welfare state and instituting tougher neighborhood policing than through further meddling by would-be social engineers. When Bill Clinton ran for office pledging to ''end welfare as we know it,'' it was clear who had won the political argument. 
 In 1999, Time magazine named ''The Other America'' one of the 10 most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century. But how relevant does it remain today? As social theory, it is deeply flawed. Harrington's culture-of-poverty thesis was at best ambiguous, at worst an impediment to making the case for what he regarded as the real solution. (In later books, he made no use of the term.) 
 But what remains fresh and vital in ''The Other America'' is its moral clarity. Harrington argued that Americans should be angry and ashamed to live in a rich society in which so many remained poor. ''The fate of the poor,'' he concluded, ''hangs upon the decision of the better-off. If this anger and shame are not forthcoming, someone can write a book about the other America a generation from now and it will be the same or worse.''
 Today the poor are no longer invisible, thanks to writers like William Julius Wilson, Alex Kotlowitz and Adrian Nicole LeBlanc, and to a popular culture that has young people in middle-class suburbs emulating the styles of the inner city. But Harrington's prediction is otherwise correct. For all the changes ushered in by the 2008 election, a renewed war on poverty does not seem to be in the offing.

HEADLINE: Trying to Gauge The REIT Rebound

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Real estate investment trusts have long been touted as good portfolio diversifiers because they typically don't move in lock step with other financial markets. But REITs have hardly been impervious to the recent debacle on Wall Street. By early March, returns on property-owning REITs had plunged an average of 75 percent from their peak in February 2007. 
 But as the broader stock market has been slowly recovering, so, too, have REIT shares. Many REITs have already made up a chunk of their losses -- from March 6 to May 5 alone, overall returns shot up 55 percent, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts -- and the market may be poised to post some modest gains in the second half of 2009.
 The trade association's index of equity REITs, which own property and constitute the bulk of the market, was up nearly 27 percent from April 1 through Thursday, though it was off 13.5 percent for the year to date, with some property sectors in positive territory. Among the top categories this year were lodging, up 3 percent; manufactured homes, up 2.5 percent; and free-standing retail stores, up 0.03 percent. (The battered mortgage sector was off 1.5 percent, on average, with home-financing REITs up an average of 0.73 percent.) 
 Does this mean that the worst may be over for the REIT market?
 Some in the industry seem to think so. ''We believe that we have seen a market bottom and a rebound from that bottom,'' said Brad Case, the association's vice president of research and industry information. 
 Though he sees a bumpy recovery ahead, Mr. Case says that publicly traded REITs are projected to lead the rebound in commercial real estate, in part because they have the ability to raise money by selling securities, an option not available to credit-starved private firms.
 ''REITs are likely to use access to the equity markets to pay down debt; then they will be in a position to acquire new assets later on,'' he said. ''Deleveraging is the theme for 2009.''
 Debt levels for REITs have typically averaged 40 percent of market capitalization, though the figure exceeded 70 percent by the first quarter of this year, according to Mr. Case, a result of the deep drop in share prices and, for a few, the wide availability of cheap debt. Now the goal for some REITs is to lower the average debt load to 25 percent. 
 To that end, many REITs have taken advantage of improved conditions on Wall Street this year to issue additional shares. Those have included a wide range of companies like the Simon Property Group and the Kimco Realty Corporation, which own shopping centers, and Host Hotels & Resorts. 
 There have been 52 secondary offerings through mid-June (18 in April alone), according to the REIT association, raising around $16 billion. By contrast, in all of 2008 there were 78 offerings that raised nearly $15 billion.
 Despite concerns that the offerings could dilute the value of current shares, and even hurt REIT share prices in the future, they have largely been well received by investors, who, analysts say, still consider many issues to be trading at bargain prices. 
 ''The investor believes that it will be a better company after the offering than before,'' said Paul Puryear, the director of real estate research at Raymond James & Associates, ''and so the feeling is, 'Why don't I participate in this discounted price?' ''
 Nonetheless, Hamid Moghadam, the chairman and chief executive of the AMB Property Corporation, said he was ''a little surprised'' by the strong investor demand. In late March, a secondary offering raised $550 million in less than a week. That money is now earmarked to help AMB shore up its balance sheet, repay loans and, Mr. Moghadam said, eventually allow the company to ''go on the offensive instead of the defensive.'' 
 Industry analysts say it may be some time, however, before most REITs reach that enviable position. 
 For one thing, the commercial property market has been extraordinarily quiet lately. ''There's no trading right now; there's no property market to speak of,'' said Mr. Puryear, noting, too, that valuing properties remains an arduous task. ''We've been focusing on replacement costs: if you're going to build a new building, what would it cost?''
 This, of course, will make it hard for those REITs looking to sift through the detritus of available distressed properties -- especially if property market conditions get worse before they get better, as some expect. 
 ''REIT stocks have turned a corner,'' said Paul E. Adornato, a senior real estate analyst at BMO Capital Markets. ''But we fully expect fundamentals will worsen for just about all property types, and by that we mean we can expect higher vacancies, lower rents and more difficulties for all real estate players.''
 At AMB Property, for example, the proportion of space occupied at the warehouses and distribution centers it operates worldwide fell from a near-historic high of 96 percent at the end of the third quarter last year to 92.5 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2009, while rents slipped 3 to 4 percent, according to Mr. Moghadam. 
 Still, he remained hopeful that market conditions would begin to stabilize. ''In the last six months, the economy was basically falling off the cliff,'' he said. ''Now, instead of falling off the cliff, it is just rolling down the hill.''
 For now, industry analysts believe that some property sectors -- and companies -- are likely to recover sooner than others.
 Mr. Adornato singles out parts of the industrial and office sectors, while other analysts at BMO Capital Markets have a positive outlook on apartments, largely because that sector continues to have access to relatively inexpensive financing from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage companies.
 On BMO's preferred list is AvalonBay Communities, which operates apartments in markets described as having a ''high barrier to entry,'' meaning that developers may encounter obstacles to construction, like strict zoning limitations or community resistance to new developments.
 Mr. Adornato particularly favors Liberty Property Trust, which owns office and industrial space in more than 20 markets in the United States and Britain. ''They did not engage in development for sale to third parties,'' he said. ''Instead, they developed a smaller volume of properties intended for their own portfolio.''
 He said he also liked First Potomac Realty Trust, which owns and operates office and industrial buildings in the Washington area. The economic stimulus package and new government programs, he said, will benefit that region. ''We expect job growth to return to Washington much earlier than the rest of the country,'' he said.
 Mr. Puryear, meanwhile, prefers REITs focused on health care, like Health Care REIT, which makes a range of investments, from housing for the elderly to hospitals and medical office buildings. ''This is a tremendous company with an outstanding track record,'' he said. ''They have a larger development pipeline than they would like to have, but they are leasing their properties very well and are well-financed.
 ''Our view so far this year has been to play the more defensive sectors.''

HEADLINE: If It's Too Big To Fail, Is It Too Big to Exist?

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Nearly a century ago, the jurist Louis Brandeis railed against what he called the ''curse of bigness.'' He warned that banks, railroads and steel companies had grown so huge that they were lording it over the nation's economic and political life. 
 ''Size, we are told, is not a crime,'' Brandeis wrote. ''But size may, at least, become noxious by reason of the means through which it is attained or the uses to which it is put.''
 Today, amid the wreckage of the gravest financial crisis since the Great Depression, bigness is one of our biggest problems. Major banks, the Detroit automakers, the financial basket case that is the American International Group -- the only reason these giant, sclerotic companies are still standing is that they have been deemed ''too big to fail.'' 
 Or, more precisely, too big to be allowed to fail. Policy makers fear companies like these are so enormous and so intertwined in the fabric of the economy that their collapse would be catastrophic. Hence, all those multibillion-dollar, taxpayer-financed bailouts. 
 In its overhaul of financial regulation last week, the Obama administration proposed several measures to try to contain the biggest of America's big banks. But it stopped far short of calling for the dismantling of those institutions. 
 A few Jeremiahs within the administration wanted more. They contended that the biggest banks must be streamlined, and that, in the future, banks should not be allowed to grow to the point where they pose a threat to the financial system. But they are losing a battle to other officials and banking executives who argue that such radical steps would be impracticable and deal yet another blow to the nation's damaged financial industry. Washington, the argument goes, let banks grow into behemoths in the first place. Now, all of us must live with the consequences. 
 But if a company is too big to fail, should it be considered too big to exist? Brandeis worried that the corporate giants of his day would imperil democracy through concentrated economic power. His essays, collected in book form and published in 1914 under the title, ''Other People's Money -- and How the Bankers Use It,'' helped drum up support for the creation of the Federal Reserve System, antitrust laws and trust busting. 
 One dissenter within the administration -- Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- says the government must stamp out the notion that Washington will ride to the rescue if big banks run into trouble. Investors must understand that they will lose money even if the government has to step in, she says. 
 ''The reality is there are investors and creditors out there that have relied on 'too big to fail' to make investment decisions,'' Ms. Bair said. ''We have to take this security blanket away.''
 That is easy to say, but not so easy to do.
 ''You have to be flexible,'' said Andrew Williams, a Treasury Department spokesman. ''You have to be clear that there is not a presumption of too big to fail. But you can't give it up entirely because to do so may not allow you to avoid, in extremis, a major meltdown.'' Lawrence H. Summers, the White House economic adviser, says there is no going back to the days of small banks. The financial world has moved on. ''I don't think you can completely turn back the clock,'' he said. 
 Policy makers argue that shackling some of the very biggest banks with new rules will keep the behemoths from getting into trouble. The overhaul of financial regulation proposed last week by the Obama administration would provide so-called resolution powers that would allow big, complex financial institutions to, in fact, fail and let regulators take them over. The government could then wind down giant financial companies over time, as it does with smaller ones. 
 The administration also wants greater regulatory scrutiny and higher capital requirements for financial companies that pose so-called ''systemic'' threats. Details about these proposals are sparse, but the thinking is that investors would press companies to curb their risks and streamline their operations if bigness had some drawbacks.
 That is not enough for some. Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman and current White House adviser, for instance, has suggested that the government limit how much money big institutions can wager trading. The way things are now, banks reap profits if their trades pan out, but taxpayers can be stuck picking up the tab if their big bets sink the company. 
 Ms. Bair and others argue that the government should impose fees on giant banks to encourage them to operate more carefully and offset some of the costs of rescuing big institutions. The administration's plan imposes such a charge only after a government rescue occurs. 
 Bigness has always been a powerful American theme. But in business, where many executives live by the creed of ''Grow or Die,'' it is dogma. Devotees of economic Darwinism insist that corporate size, and its accompanying economies of scale, brings progress and benefits to consumers.
 But how big is too big to fail? And how would you measure it anyway? In the case of banks and giants like A.I.G. and Fannie Mae, policy makers argue that the interconnectedness of modern finance, as much as the size of the players, is the real issue. The collapse of one big financial company could cascade through the industry. In the case of General Motors and Chrysler, a failure could mean that thousands of jobs -- not only at those companies, but at their suppliers as well -- could evaporate. 
 The too-big-to-fail doctrine, sometimes called T.B.T.F., goes back at least as far as Brandeis' time, when, in 1914, the Treasury stepped in to provide financial aid to New York City. In the 1980s, when the government rescued Continental Illinois Bank, Stewart B. McKinney, a Connecticut Congressman, declared that the government had created a new class of banks, those too big to fail. The phrase returned and stuck. 
 Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, often uses a wonkish euphemism. He refers to Brobdingnagian banks as ''systemically critical'' institutions. The Obama administration rolled out another description last week: ''Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies.'' 
 What is remarkable is that, even now, the T.B.T.F. club and some of its members are actually growing, not shrinking. A decade-long run of mergers in the banking industry has concentrated power in fewer hands. Last autumn, when the financial crisis was at its height, policy makers pushed some banks to buy weaker ones to head off failures. (See Merrill Lynch, acquisition of, among others.)
 Frederic S. Mishkin, a former Federal Reserve governor from 2006 to 2008, for one, said there could be no turning back on too big to fail. ''You can't put that genie in the bottle again,'' he said. ''We are going to have to deal with it.''

HEADLINE: Disgruntled Mexicans Plan an Election Message to Politicians: We Prefer Nobody

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
With Mexico's midterm elections two weeks away, the most spirited campaigning has been for a candidate with no name, no face and no particular policy positions. Call him Nulo.
 Nulo -- Spanish for null and void -- is drawing support from disgruntled Mexicans who say the country's politicians are focused more on their own power games than on the people they are supposed to serve. So, instead of urging voters to throw their weight behind any of the real candidates vying to be elected mayors, governors or members of Congress on July 5, Nulo's backers are calling on Mexicans to nullify their ballots -- and vote for no one at all.
 ''There have been campaigns like this in the past, but it's never caught fire,'' said Daniel Lund, president of the MUND Group, a Mexico City polling firm. ''Now, it's catching fire.'' 
 Support for the Voto Nulo campaign has spread on the Internet, where supporters extol the virtues of sending Mexican political parties a stark message: Voting for nothing is better than backing the politicians currently running the country.
 Mexico was essentially a one-party state until 2000, when the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, finally lost its grip on the presidency. But a sense of frustration has developed in recent years as more choices on the ballot have not, in the minds of many Mexicans, translated into a more responsive government.
 The country is now in the midst of a particularly rough patch. The economy is in the doldrums, hit hard by the financial crisis in the United States. Political corruption is regarded as being as bad as ever, a point highlighted recently by the arrests of several mayors accused of consorting with drug traffickers. And insecurity remains a constant worry, despite the anticrime offensive being waged by President Felipe Calderon.
 Just how much support Nulo will receive is unclear, although the Federal Election Institute, the public body that oversees the voting, has taken it seriously enough to put forward a counter campaign, and seven of the eight political parties in Mexico City gathered the other day to argue against the Nulo effort.
 Political analysts say about 2.5 percent of the ballots cast in any Mexican election are nullified, most unintentionally. With the Nulo campaign seeming to gain support by the day, spoiled ballots next month are expected to be higher -- from 5 percent of the voters to significantly more, according to various estimates.
 But there is a great difference of opinion on what effect even strong support for Nulo will have, since under Mexican voting rules, Nulo cannot win.
 Strong support could embarrass the candidates, supporters say, and send a message to the parties now controlling Mexican politics that they need to change. Luis Manuel Perez de Acha, a lawyer who is spearheading www.votaenblanco.org.mx, one of the main Nulo campaign sites, wants voters to mark their ballots in a special way, first by drawing a giant circle to represent the nation's citizens and then marking it with a big X to symbolize support for them.
 Detractors of the Nulo campaign counter that those spoiling their ballots are doing damage to democracy and allowing other voters to decide who will govern them.
 ''Those who lose if we don't respect institutions and don't go to vote are future generations,'' Augustin Llamas Mendoza, a political analyst at Pan-American University, wrote in a recent newspaper commentary.
 Ravi Singh, an Internet consultant from the United States who is helping several Mexican candidates with their online campaigning, described the Nulo effort to an American reporter as ''unpatriotic'' and ''like a bunch of babies crying.''
 Some of Nulo's backers have not always been so turned off by politics. One of the biggest names to join the Nulo cause is Dulce Maria Sauri, a former governor, a member of Congress and a leader of the PRI.
 Party leaders prevented her from appearing on the ballot next month, which seems to have turned her against her former profession to set off on her own Internet campaign backing Nulo.
 Experts do not expect a surge by Nulo to significantly change the distribution of support for the various parties. The PRI has been leading in most polls, followed by Mr. Calderon's National Action Party and, in a distant third place, the left-leaning Democratic Revolution Party.
 With Nulo's campaign getting the kind of buzz candidates desire, other creative protest efforts have sprung up. Some are pushing for voters to write in figures from the country's past, like Pancho Villa, a revolutionary leader, or Benito Juarez, a beloved president from the 19th century.
 Turnout is typically low for Mexico's midterm elections, which take place every three years, and some polls suggest that as many as 60 percent of voters will stay home next month, supporting none of the real candidates and not Nulo, either.

HEADLINE: Putting a Price on News

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT. 
The public editor can be reached by e-mail: public@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ON June 1, The Times raised its newsstand price to $2 for the daily paper and $5 or $6 for the Sunday paper, depending on the part of the country where you live. Home delivery prices went up an average of roughly 10 percent. In the last week, the newspaper has trimmed the dimensions of its Sunday magazine and announced that it was eliminating a half page of financial tables and other features in Business Day.
 It is a familiar pattern. In the face of a severe recession and a technological revolution luring readers away from print, the price of the ink-on-paper Times keeps going up and some content is reduced or disappears. The losses are as small as a list of companies mentioned in each day's paper and as large as whole sections, like Escapes and zoned sections for local news in the New York area. 
 Some readers feel slighted. Janet Kronfeld of Haverford, Pa., said she still has not gotten over the loss of TV listings in February and is thinking about canceling her subscription. Marianne Lepre-Nolan of Somers, N.Y., in northern Westchester County, protested the elimination of the Westchester section. ''A section omitted and a price increase?'' she wrote. ''I simply want someone to care enough to read of my discouragement.'' Bruce Einsohn of the Bronx is upset that there is no longer a section for live local news in the Sunday paper. ''I understand the need for cost cutting, and I understand the desire of The Times to market itself as a national paper, but what about us locals?'' he asked.
 Times editors say the new Sunday Metropolitan section will still have meaty reporting and that major breaking local news will appear in the front section. Some of the Escapes content moved to the back of the Weekend section.
 And the editors urge readers to find missing content like financial data on the paper's Web site. But this could drive customers away from the printed newspaper -- the part of the business that, though declining, generates most of the revenue.
 It may be necessary as The Times tries to align revenue and costs. But I think it is risky and makes it imperative to find a way to get money from online readers, who now get everything that is in the newspaper -- and more -- free.
 ''Surely they've heard of that phrase, 'death by a thousand cuts,' '' said John Morton, a newspaper analyst. ''The more reason you give people to go away from your newspaper for information, the more damage you do to your franchise.''
 Morton said he recognizes the pressures that The Times and all newspapers are under, with advertising revenue essentially falling off the table. In the first quarter of this year, it was down 27 percent for The New York Times Media Group, which includes The Times and the International Herald Tribune.
 The Times deserves great credit for cutting far less than other newspapers. While others have closed Washington and overseas news bureaus, made wholesale reductions in newsgathering staffs, and slashed the space devoted to news, The Times has held remarkably steady.
 The newsroom budget of more than $200 million is being trimmed by millions this year -- editors refuse to say exactly how much -- and staffers have taken a 5 percent pay cut. But editors say the newshole for the main daily sections has not changed since it was reduced by 5 percent in 2007. The newsroom head count, roughly 1,250, is close to its peak, although many are doing jobs unheard of a few years ago, like producers of video and audio for the Web site. While there are fewer reporters covering local news, there are more covering Washington and more overseas than a decade ago. Though the number of still photographers is down by a couple, there are a dozen new videographers.
 John Geddes, the managing editor in charge of newsroom operations, said he knows that readers are upset when they lose content about which they care passionately, but he said the goal in these tough times is to preserve ''what separates us from everyone else: that's the reporting and the writing and the scope.'' 
 Scott Heekin-Canedy, the president and general manager of the newspaper, said that The Times has always added and subtracted content and that most readers believe that the overall value of the paper is undiminished by recent changes. He said that roughly 825,000 of The Times's one million subscribers have been taking the paper for two years or more, a sign of remarkable loyalty. Some newspapers turn over -- or churn -- a majority of their subscribers every year.
 Heekin-Canedy said The Times looks at other products when it considers a price increase -- $1.50 to $2 for a bottle of Coke, $2 for a cup of Starbucks coffee or $2 for a Wall Street Journal. Michael Norris of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., wrote to Yasmin Namini, the executive in charge of circulation, ''I am embarrassed that we pay so little for what continues to be the finest daily newspaper in the world.'' Norris added, ''Count us in for whatever rate you decide to be necessary to ensure the continued survival of The Times.''
 Times executives are studying possible ways to charge readers for online content, an increasing focus in the industry as the world moves to the Web. Heekin-Canedy said options include a so-called metered model, charging customers for how much they read, and a membership model that would leave much content free but give members benefits, like access to special events. He expects decisions by mid to late summer.
 I am already hearing from readers who want to pony up for what they read online. ''I would pay a lot to keep a free press and energetic reporters on the job,'' said Cherie Rouse of Loma Linda, Calif. Jeffrey Alexander of Kenosha, Wis., asked, ''Could there at least be a tip jar?''
 Some readers, like Brian Jones of Newport, R.I., say they cannot do without The Times but wish it would be more candid in explaining what is going on. He had to do the arithmetic to figure out from the notice of the price increase that his subscription was going up by a double-digit percentage. ''Deal honestly with me,'' he said.
 Some announcements of changes have been models of clarity and candor. In a letter last Sunday explaining why the magazine was 9 percent smaller, its editor, Gerald Marzorati, made clear that he did not like making the change but told how he and his staff turned a crisis into a redesign that better organized the magazine and minimized content loss.
 Other announcements are perfunctory, failing to explain the reasons behind the moves. Readers deserve those details. They have shown that they understand the problems The Times faces. 
 ''I've been in this business a long time,'' Namini said, ''and I always get letters from people unhappy about price increases.'' But this time is different, she said. ''I've never seen so many letters from people who say, 'I understand it,' '' she said. Those readers feel ''they have a relationship with The Times. They're not just reading a newspaper.''
 The Times is indeed the strongest news brand in the United States. Preserving it through what amounts to an advertising depression and the Internet revolution may be the greatest challenge the newspaper has ever faced.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths BAER, DR

 BODY:
BAER--Dr. George Martin, died on June 2, 2009, in Mexico City, Mexico at the age of 73. Dr. Baer was an eminent scientist, veterinarian and public health specialist. He was responsible for developing the oral vaccine for rabies that led to the eradication of wildlife rabies in Europe. At the time of his death he was working on a new vaccine against numerous strains of the influenza virus, a project that he was especially eager to complete given the recent worldwide outbreak of the H1N1 virus. Throughout his professional career, Dr. Baer acted from a deeply held belief in the power of preventive medicine and the desire to combat disease both in animals and in humans. Dr. Baer was born on January 12, 1936, in London, England. 
He was the only son of Kathi Meyer Baer, of Berlin, and Curtis Otto Baer, of Strassburg, Germany. His mother was a renowned musicologist and the first woman to be awarded a doctoral degree in musicology in Leipzig, Germany in the 1920s. His father was a student of Heidegger, a professor of art history at Vassar College and a noted collector of 18th and 19th century master drawings and paintings. Dr. Baer's parents fled Nazi Germany for Paris, France, and then emigrated to the United States in 1940. He grew up in New Rochelle, New York, where he became a competitive horseman and thus began his lifelong love of animals. To his parents' surprise, he did not follow a career in the arts, but instead chose the sciences. After graduating from the Westtown School in Westtown, Pennsylvania, in 1952, he attended Cornell University, where he earned an undergraduate degree in agricultural sciences in 1954 and a degree in veterinary medicine in 1959. He earned a master's degree in Public Health from the University of Michigan in 1960. Dr. Baer began his career in public health by joining the New York Public Health Service, where he learned the practice of epidemiology and virology. In 1968 he entered the U.S. Public Health Service and, thanks to Dr. James H. Steele, his friend and mentor, started a long and successful career at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. There, he became head of the Rabies Laboratory and with his team of scientists and researchers developed the oral vaccine for wildlife rabies. His expertise in the virology of rabies and his role in developing the oral vaccine against wildlife rabies made him one of the foremost international experts in this area. His book, The Natural History of Rabies, is a definitive reference in the field. On his father's suggestion, in 1959 Dr. Baer traveled to Mexico. There, he met and fell in love with his wife, Maria Olga Lara, and with the country, its people, history, culture and traditions. From 1966 to 1968 he was sent by the CDC to work with the Mexican Public Health Service in Palo Alto, Mexico. Based on his training and working closely with a group of young Mexican scientists and veterinarians, he helped lay the groundwork for Mexico's public health programs against rabies. In addition to his native English and German, Dr. Baer was a fluent Spanish speaker, and loved languages, literature, art and music. He was also an avid mountaineer. Dr. Baer is survived by his wife of 49 years, Maria Olga Baer, three daughters, Katherine Baer, economist, of Washington, D.C., Alexandra Baer, sculptor and artist, of New Paltz, New York, and Isabella Baer, an opera singer, of Mexico City, and four granddaughters. Funeral services were held in Mexico City at the Iglesia de Santa Rosa de Lima on June 4, 2009.

HEADLINE: Go East, Young Man, And Make Your Fortune

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
Dire economic times have left many people wondering if the American dream is just a fairy tale. In his autobiography, ''The Education of an American Dreamer'' (Twelve, $34.99), Peter G. Peterson offers a refreshingly credible, often cautionary tale of his own classic rags-to-riches rise -- and a few glimmers of hope, inspiration and guidance for the rest of us.
 At 83, Mr. Peterson is a child of the Depression, but his resume puts most modern-day multitaskers to shame. He is a self-made billionaire and philanthropist as well as a former ad executive, manufacturing mogul, Wall Street financier and secretary of commerce. What distinguishes this book from most memoirs by business titans is Mr. Peterson's ability to mix insider tidbits with humor, painful self-revelation and candid skepticism of the Eastern establishment that eventually welcomed him as a tuxedo-wearing member. 
 The book is subtitled ''How a Son of Greek Immigrants Learned His Way From a Nebraska Diner to Washington, Wall Street, and Beyond.'' His narrative begins in Kearney, Neb., where his father opened the diner in 1923 after changing his name from Georgios Petropoulos to George Peterson. 
 ''My biggest challenge as a boy was trying to fit in,'' Mr. Peterson recalls. ''But fitting in was really tough because I wanted to be 100 percent American, while my parents clung to their Greek customs. They pulled furiously one way, I the other. All children struggle to escape their parents so they can define themselves, but mine had roots deep in another world.''
 After having to wear homespun Greek outfits and submitting to cheap haircuts offered as barter for food in his father's restaurant, he won admission to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Though blessed with mathematical aptitude, he lacked the drawing skills required of engineers, and says he was distracted by ''the boozing and debauchery'' of college life. 
 He says he was expelled near the end of freshman year for ''borrowing'' portions of a class paper from Roy Cohn (later a right-hand man of Joseph McCarthy). Sobered, he later graduated from Northwestern and the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.
 Mr. Peterson's early business forays marked him as a wunderkind who relied on systematic market research. By 29, he became a top-ranking executive at the McCann-Erickson ad agency. In an ironic twist, he says his boss submitted a paper that Mr. Peterson had written to an industry publication under his own byline. Mr. Peterson quit. Soon, he was recruited by Charles Percy, chairman of Bell & Howell (and future senator), and eventually became that company's C.E.O.
 In 1970, two Republicans, Douglas Dillon and George Shultz, lured Mr. Peterson to Washington, where he became a special economic adviser to President Richard M. Nixon and later was commerce secretary. He says he bridled under the ''Palace Guard'' led by H. R. Haldeman. After a ''deepening estrangement from the White House,'' he left the Commerce job in 1973, before the Watergate scandal upended the administration. 
 Mr. Peterson started the next of his careers on Wall Street that same year, joining the notoriously fractious Lehman Brothers as vice chairman on its investment banking side. After helping save Lehman from the brink of bankruptcy and rising to chairman, he tried to share power with Lew Glucksman, a veteran from the firm's trading side, but was ousted in a palace coup.
 That turned out to be a blessing in disguise. With the former Lehman Brothers partner Stephen A. Schwarzman, Mr. Peterson went on to be a co-founder of the Blackstone Group, the private equity firm with the then-iconoclastic philosophy of pursuing only ''friendly'' deals. Blackstone's role in deals, including Bridgestone's acquisition of Firestone and Sony's of Columbia Pictures, helped propel the firm into Wall Street's top tier.
 On Valentine's Day 2007, Mr. Schwarzman threw himself an extravagant birthday party with entertainment by the likes of Rod Stewart, creating what Mr. Peterson calls a ''press firestorm.'' Four months later, Blackstone floated an initial public offering. Having already announced plans to retire, Mr. Peterson, by then an octogenarian, cashed out, receiving a wire transfer in the staggering amount of $1.85 billion. 
 Upon receiving the transfer, he recalls, ''my mind raced back to the 'Blazing Saddles' character played by Madeline Kahn who said in her Germanic lisp, 'It's twooo, it's twooo!' '' He says he gave most of the money to his private foundation.
 NOTING that he twice underwent intensive psychoanalysis, Mr. Peterson recounts his private life with self-effacing candor. He blames himself for the failure of two of his three marriages. (He is now married to Joan Ganz Cooney, a creator of ''Sesame Street.'') The root causes, he says, were traits inherited from his father, namely a pursuit of perfectionism and ''obsessive devotion to work'' at the expense of family. He has long since come to terms with the challenges of having a son with a learning disability, and he says he is proud of having at last grown close to his five children and nine grandchildren.
 Mr. Peterson is both overly modest and a bit too sketchy in accounting for his business success, which he repeatedly attributes to ''pure dumb luck.'' In fact, he demonstrated a rare gift for combining his pioneering market research statistics with keen insights into human behavior in analyzing business and political issues.
 Mr. Peterson may be among the last of a dying breed, but it is still uplifting to be reminded that the son of Greek immigrants made his American dream come true.

HEADLINE: Drug Makers Agree to Offer Medicare Discounts

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Drug makers have offered to spend $80 billion over 10 years to help older Americans afford medicines and to lower the cost of a proposed overhaul of the health care system, officials said Saturday. 
 In a statement, President Obama said an agreement reached between drug makers and Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who is the chairman of the Finance Committee, narrowed the ''doughnut hole'' in the Medicare prescription-drug program that raises costs for many seniors.
 ''As part of the health reform legislation that I expect Congress to enact this year,'' Mr. Obama said, ''pharmaceutical companies will extend discounts on prescription drugs to millions of seniors who currently are subjected to crushing out-of-pocket expenses.'' 
 Congressional Democrats have been working on draft legislation to fulfill one of his top campaign promises: expanding health care coverage and lowering the cost of a system that makes up 17 percent of the economy.
 Republicans questioned the price tag of an overhaul when the Congressional Budget Office estimated that a version of the plan being considered by Mr. Baucus's panel would cost at least $1.6 trillion. The United States Chamber of Commerce began a campaign against the plan, criticizing provisions being proposed, like a mandate on employers to provide health insurance to their workers.
 The agreement would commit companies to cover as much as 50 percent of the cost of brand-name medicines in Medicare's Part D prescription drug program.
 Under Medicare's prescription drug benefit program, patients buy medicines through conventional or mail-order pharmacies. They pay the first $295 of costs, then the plan covers 75 percent of the purchases until the total reaches $2,700, according to Medicare's explanation of the program. Patients must then pay all costs until spending $4,350 out of pocket. Thereafter, patients pay a small co-payment for each drug until the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Taking The Hill

 BODY:
In Matt Bai's description of President Obama's team working with Congress, specifically toward health care reform, he writes that ''doctors' bills and hospital stays'' swallow up an ever-increasing share of the economy. As Julie Weed put it in her article in Sunday Business that appeared on the same day, ''A third of the money received by primary-care physicians pays for interactions between a doctor's practice and patient's health plans.'' Real savings are achievable in the billing-management arena. Maybe some of the savings could even be used to hire more hospital nurses and pay for more primary-care settings that offer services like those of Lili Sacks, a doctor in Weed's article. 
 GARY W. NYMAN Baltimore
 Matt Bai writes that fixing the health care system is ''like ripping out all the walls of your house and completely reconfiguring the plumbing, the air ducts and the wiring all at once.'' Having lived though a recent kitchen renovation, I would add to this comparison that we will still have to live in this gutted house while the renovation is going on, unless we all move to Canada and Mexico until it's done.
 SIDNEY MANANSALA Oak Park, Ill.
 It is amusing to think of Joe Biden and Rahm Emanuel running on treadmills in the Senate and House gyms, respectively, to gather rumors and talk policy. I certainly agree that the Obama administration is likely to have more success in dealing with Congress because of the makeup of its staff and the approaches that it is taking. That said, I think Matt Bai gives the administration too much credit. Yes, the Obama administration is loaded with ex-congressmen and Congressional aides. With both Obama and Biden coming from the Senate, what else would we expect?
 Obama does not inherently deserve credit for deliberately preparing to deal with Congress by hiring people from that branch. He hired them because that is one of his primary networks. Bush, Clinton, Reagan and Carter all brought in ''outsiders'' because that is who they knew.
 The president has brought in people from the legislative branch because they are who he knew. That is natural organization building, I think, and not necessarily a sign of a more enlightened approach.

HEADLINE: Obama Pushes Financial Regulatory Overhaul

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama, striking a forceful tone, said Saturday that he would fight for his package on overhauling the financial regulatory system as he tried to drum up support for his proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency. 
 In his weekly radio and Internet address, Mr. Obama promised to battle what he called special interests. ''The American people sent me to Washington to stand up for their interests,'' he said. ''And while I'm not spoiling for a fight, I'm ready for one.''
 The president characterized the need for regulatory changes as ''necessary to end'' the economic crisis.
 ''As we continue to recover from an historic economic crisis,'' he said, ''it is clear to everyone that one of its major causes was a breakdown in oversight that led to widespread abuses in the financial system.
 ''An epidemic of irresponsibility took hold from Wall Street to Washington to Main Street. And the consequences have been disastrous. Millions of Americans have seen their life savings erode. Families have been devastated by job losses. Business large and small have closed their doors.''
 The administration's plan, unveiled on Wednesday, would give the Federal Reserve greater supervisory authority over large financial institutions whose problems pose potential risks to the economic system. It would also expand the reach of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to seize and break up troubled institutions. And it would create a council of regulators, led by the Treasury secretary, to fill in regulatory gaps. 
 In doing so, the plan seeks to give Washington the tools to police the shadow system of finance that has operated outside the government's purview, and to make it easier for regulators to head off problems at large, troubled institutions or take control of them if they fail.
 The Consumer Financial Protection Agency would require banks, mortgage lenders and credit card companies to provide consumers with a more nutritious diet, financially speaking. Banking officials have complained that the scope of the agency is too large. Obama administration officials argue that banking regulators in the past have had an inherent conflict of interest between ensuring the soundness of institutions and protecting consumers.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Wide Support for Idea Of Government-Run Health Plan

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Marina Stefan and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Americans overwhelmingly support substantial changes to the health care system and are strongly behind one of the most contentious proposals Congress is considering, a government-run insurance plan to compete with private insurers, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 The poll found that most Americans would be willing to pay higher taxes so everyone could have health insurance and that they said the government could do a better job of holding down health-care costs than the private sector. 
 Yet the survey also revealed considerable unease about the impact of heightened government involvement, on both the economy and the quality of the respondents' own medical care. While 85 percent of respondents said the health care system needed to be fundamentally changed or completely rebuilt, 77 percent said they were very or somewhat satisfied with the quality of their own care. 
 That paradox was skillfully exploited by opponents of the last failed attempt at overhauling the health system, during former President Bill Clinton's first term. Sixteen years later, it underscores the tricky task facing lawmakers and President Obama as they try to address the health system's substantial problems without igniting fears that people could lose what they like. 
 Across a number of questions, the poll detected substantial support for a greater government role in health care, a position generally identified with the Democratic Party. When asked which party was more likely to improve health care, only 18 percent of respondents said the Republicans, compared with 57 percent who picked the Democrats. Even one of four Republicans said the Democrats would do better.
 The national telephone survey, which was conducted from June 12 to 16, found that 72 percent of those questioned supported a government-administered insurance plan -- something like Medicare for those under 65 -- that would compete for customers with private insurers. Twenty percent said they were opposed. 
 Republicans in Congress have fiercely criticized the proposal as an unneeded expansion of government that might evolve into a system of nationalized health coverage and lead to the rationing of care.
 But in the poll, the proposal received broad bipartisan backing, with half of those who call themselves Republicans saying they would support a public plan, along with nearly three-fourths of independents and almost nine in 10 Democrats.
 The poll, of 895 adults, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 Mr. Obama and many Democrats have argued that a public plan would be essential, in the president's words, to ''keep insurance companies honest.'' But Mr. Obama has also signaled a willingness to compromise for Republican support, perhaps by establishing member-owned insurance cooperatives instead.
 It is not clear how fully the public understands the complexities of the government plan proposal, and the poll results indicate that those who said they were following the debate were somewhat less supportive.
 But they clearly indicate growing confidence in the government's ability to manage health care. Half of those questioned said they thought government would be better at providing medical coverage than private insurers, up from 30 percent in polls conducted in 2007. Nearly 60 percent said Washington would have more success in holding down costs, up from 47 percent.
 Sixty-four percent said they thought the federal government should guarantee coverage, a figure that has stayed steady all decade. Nearly 6 in 10 said they would be willing to pay higher taxes to make sure that all were insured, with 4 in 10 willing to pay as much as $500 more a year.
 And a plurality, 48 percent, said they supported a requirement that all Americans have health insurance so long as public subsidies were offered to those who could not afford it. Thirty-eight percent said they were opposed. 
 In a follow-up interview, Matt Flurkey, 56, a public plan supporter from Plymouth, Minn., said he could accept that the quality of his care might diminish if coverage was universal. ''Even though it might not be quite as good as what we get now,'' he said, ''I think the government should run health care. Far too many people are being denied now, and costs would be lower.'' 
 While the survey results depict a nation desperate for change, it also reveals a deep wariness of the possible consequences. Half to two-thirds of respondents said they worried that if the government guaranteed health coverage, they would see declines in the quality of their own care and in their ability to choose doctors and get needed treatment. 
 ''It is the responsibility of the government to guarantee insurance for all,'' said Juanita Lomaz, a 65-year-old office worker from Bakersfield, Calif. ''But my care will get worse because they'll have to limit care in order to cover everyone.''
 When asked their opinion of specific changes being considered in Washington, three-fourths of those surveyed said they favored requiring health insurers to cover anyone, regardless of pre-existing medical conditions. Only a fifth supported taxing employer-provided health benefits to help pay the cost of coverage for the uninsured. And there was deep uncertainty about whether employers should be required to either help insure their workers or pay into a fund for covering the uninsured. 
 Three of four people questioned said unnecessary medical tests and treatments had become a serious problem, suggesting that they would support calls by health researchers for a payment system that would better reward appropriate care. But an even higher number, 87 percent, said the inability of people to have the needed tests and treatments was a serious problem. One in four said that in the last 12 months they or someone in their household had cut back on medications because of the expense, and one in five said someone had skipped a recommended test or treatment.
 The poll found that Americans were far less satisfied with the cost of health care than with the quality of it. Mr. Obama, who has emphasized the need to reduce costs, has found an audience for his argument that health care legislation is vital to economic recovery. Eighty-six percent of those polled said rising costs posed a serious economic threat.
 Yet only a fifth of those with insurance said the cost of their own medical care posed a hardship. And only a fourth said that keeping health costs down was a more urgent need than providing coverage for the country's nearly 50 million uninsured. That was a notable change from a Times/CBS poll taken in early April, when 40 percent said that controlling costs was more pressing.

HEADLINE: Obama Pushes Financial Reforms

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama, striking a forceful tone, said that he will fight for his package to reform the financial regulatory system -- unveiled on Wednesday -- as he tried to drum up support for his proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency. 
 In his weekly radio address aired Saturday morning, Mr. Obama promised to battle what he called special interests and to push hard for regulatory reform.
 ''The American people sent me to Washington to stand up for their interests,'' he said. ''And while I'm not spoiling for a fight, I'm ready for one.''
 He took another punch at Washington and Wall Street--as he has been doing in the past, and characterized the need for regulatory reform as ''necessary to end'' the economic crisis now facing the country.
 ''As we continue to recover from an historic economic crisis, it is clear to everyone that one of its major causes was a breakdown in oversight that led to widespread abuses in the financial system,'' Mr. Obama said. ''An epidemic of irresponsibility took hold from Wall Street to Washington to Main Street. And the consequences have been disastrous. Millions of Americans have seen their life savings erode; families have been devastated by job losses; business large and small have closed their doors.''
 The plan the president announced on Wednesday would give the Federal Reserve greater supervisory authority over large financial institutions whose problems pose potential risks to the economic system. It would separately expand the reach of the Federal Deposit Insurance Cooperation to seize and break up troubled financial institutions. And it would create a council of regulators, led by the Treasury secretary, to fill in regulatory gaps.
 In doing so, the plan seeks to give Washington the tools to police the shadow system of finance that has grown up outside the government's purview, and to make it easier for regulators to head off problems at large, troubled institutions or take control of them if they fail.
 The Consumer Financial Protection Agency would require banks, mortgage lenders and credit card companies to provide consumers with a more nutritious diet, financially speaking. But the banking industry, which says it stands to lose billions of dollars, is bracing for a fight as the administration's plan to overhaul the way the industry is regulated heads to Capitol Hill.
 Banking officials have complained that the scope of the agency is too large. Obama administration officials, for their part, argue that banking regulators in the past have had an inherent conflict of interest between ensuring the safety and soundness of institutions and protecting consumers.
 ''It is true that this crisis was caused in part by Americans who took on too much debt and took out loans they simply could not afford,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But there are also millions of Americans who signed contracts they did not always understand offered by lenders who did not always tell the truth. Today, folks signing up for a mortgage, student loan, or credit card face a bewildering array of incomprehensible options. Companies compete not by offering better products, but more complicated ones -- with more fine print and hidden terms. It's no coincidence that the lack of strong consumer protections led to abuses against consumers; the lack of rules to stop deceptive lending practices led to abuses against borrowers.''

HEADLINE: Why Those Flies Are So Hard to Swat

BYLINE: Compiled by THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
WHY THOSE FLIES ARE SO HARD TO SWAT
 The science Web site Cosmos explores the difficulties of swatting a fly -- which President Obama succeeded in doing last week during an interview with John Harwood for CNBC and The New York Times. (''I got the sucker,'' the president boasted after fatally slapping the fly on the back of his hand.) 
 Michael Dickinson has been interviewed hundreds of times about his research on the biomechanics of insect flight. One question has always dogged him: Why are flies so hard to swat? 
 ''Now I can finally answer,'' said Dickinson, a bioengineer at the California Institute of Technology.Using high-speed, digital imaging of fruit flies faced with a looming swatter, Dickinson and graduate student Gwyneth Card determined the secret to a fly's crafty behavior. 
 Long before the fly leaps, its tiny ''brain'' calculates the location of the impending threat, comes up with an escape plan, and places its legs in an optimal position to hop out of the way in the opposite direction. All of this action takes place within about 100 milliseconds after the fly first spots the swatter.
 ''This illustrates how rapidly the fly's brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response,'' said Dickinson, who this week publishes a paper detailing the research in the U.S. journal Current Biology.
 THE ECONOMICS OF ONLINE FRIENDSHIPS
 Stephen Baker, writing in BusinessWeek, about the many values of friendships.
 Friendships aren't what they used to be. We now have tools, from e-mail to social networks, to keep in touch with people who a decade ago would have drifted into distant memories. Practically every hand we shake and every business card we exchange can lead to an invitation, sometimes within minutes, for a ''friendship'' on LinkedIn or Facebook. And unless we sever them, these ties could linger for the rest of our lives. 
 What do these relationships say about us and the people in our networks? Companies armed with rich new data and powerful computers are beginning to explore these questions. They're finding that digital friendships speak volumes about us as consumers and workers, and decoding the data can lead to profitable insights. Calculating the value of these relationships has become a defining challenge for businesses and individuals. 
 SUSHI, AMERICAN-STYLE
 Trevor Corson, writing in The Atlantic, about how some American chefs are returning to sushi's roots.
 During the pleasant years I spent in Japan, friends would take me to neighborhood sushi joints. Most of the customers would sit around the counter, while the chef, a convivial character who knew many of his patrons, would suggest dishes based on the seasonal and local delicacies he had purchased that morning. After I returned to the U.S., I made a strange discovery: most American sushi diners sat at tables and ordered from menus, through waiters. Confused, I would seek out the sushi bar, but when I sat down, the Japanese chefs were initially standoffish, even dismissive. As soon as I explained -- in Japanese -- that I'd lived in Japan, they treated me differently. 
 Jeffrey Nitta helped me understand what I was experiencing. Nitta, a restaurant consultant in Los Angeles, has watched the sushi business since it took root in the U.S. in the 1970s. He and I quickly bonded over our nostalgia for the Japanese way of eating sushi. ''The whole industry of sushi worries me,'' Nitta told me. ''There's no more chefs getting to know customers.'' Nitta's explanation: ''Most Japanese restaurant people think that Americans ultimately cannot appreciate the real deal.''

HEADLINE: Changing The Patterns of Medical Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 As a physician, I see every day the type of overuse of medical care described in ''Something's Got to Give in Medicare Spending'' (Economic View, June 14). 
 But the column took too narrow a view in asserting that ''the financial incentives for doctors and medical institutions to recommend more procedures'' are the chief driving force behind the high cost of care; nonfinancial incentives are at least as strong. 
 Much has been written about defensive medicine, wherein physicians order additional, and often unnecessary, tests to avoid being sued. Even without the threat of lawsuits, I suspect that this practice would continue. Physicians don't want to miss things, lawsuits or not. There are also times, perhaps due to the harried nature of medical decision-making, when ordering tests takes the place of careful consideration of a test's usefulness or the likelihood of an important finding.
 Patients are also often insistent on having tests, just as they are insistent on getting prescriptions for the latest, greatest drugs they saw advertised on TV.
 Reining in this overuse of care thus goes against the perceived interests of both physicians and patients. Necessary as it may be, changing these attitudes will be difficult.
 Eric Elton, M.D.
 Evanston, Ill., June 15
 To the Editor: 
 Universal coverage, cost control and quality medical care are essential but insufficient to achieve good health in our nation. As the column stated, factors including where and how we live, as well as social standing, are the significant determinants of health. 
 Until we begin to seriously address those factors, worsening health status and a growing burden of preventable chronic disease will exceed the health system's ability to adequately deliver necessary care -- health care reform notwithstanding.

HEADLINE: Obama's Make-or-Break Summer

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THAT First 100 Days hoopla seems like a century ago. The countless report cards it engendered are already obsolete. The real story begins now. With Iran, universal health care, energy reform and the economic recovery all on the line, the still-new, still-popular president's true tests are about to come.
 Here's one thing Barack Obama does not have to worry about: the opposition. Approval ratings for Republicans hit an all-time low last week in both the New York Times/CBS News and Wall Street Journal/NBC News polls. That's what happens when a party's most creative innovations are novel twists on old-fashioned sex scandals. Just when you thought the G.O.P. could never match the high bar set by Larry Craig's men's room toe-tapping, along came Senator John Ensign of Nevada, an ostentatiously pious born-again Christian whose ecumenical outreach drove him to engineer political jobs for his mistress, her cuckolded husband and the couple's son. At least it can no longer be said that the Republicans have no plan for putting Americans back to work. 
 But as ever, the lack of an adversary with gravitas is a double-edged sword for Obama. It tempts him to be cocky and to coast. That's a rare flaw in a president whose temperament, smarts and judgment remain impressive. Yet it is not insignificant. Though we don't know how Obama will fare on all the challenges he faces this summer, last week's big rollout of his financial reform package was a big punt, an accommodation to the status quo. Given that the economy remains the country's paramount concern -- and that all new polling finds that most Americans still think it's dire -- this timid response was a lost opportunity. It violated the Rahm Emanuel dictum that ''you never want a serious crisis to go to waste'' and could yet prompt a serious political backlash. 
 A tip-off to what was coming appeared in a Washington Post op-ed article that the administration's two financial gurus, Lawrence Summers and Timothy Geithner, wrote to preview their plan. ''Some people will say that this is not the time to debate the future of financial regulation, that this debate should wait until the crisis is fully behind us,'' they wrote by way of congratulating themselves on taking charge. 
 Who exactly are these ''some people'' who want to delay debate on the future of regulation? Not anyone you or I know. Most Americans were desperate for action and wondered why it was taking so long. The only people who Summers and Geithner could possibly be talking about are the bankers in their cohort who helped usher us into this disaster in the first place. Both men are proteges of one of them, Robert Rubin, the former wise man of Citigroup. 
 There are some worthwhile protections in the Summers-Geithner legislation, especially for consumers, but there's little that will disturb these unnamed ''people'' too much. I'll leave it to financial analysts to detail why the small-bore tinkering in the administration blueprint won't prevent another perfect storm of arcane derivatives, unchecked (and risk-rewarding) executive compensation and too-big-to-fail banks like Citi. Suffice it to say that the Obama team has not resuscitated the Glass-Steagall Act, the New Deal reform that Summers helped dismantle in the Clinton years and that would have prevented the creation of banking behemoths that held the economy hostage. 
 A particularly dramatic example of how the old Wall Street order remains intact can be seen by looking at the fate of credit-rating agencies like Moody's, which gave triple-A grades to some of the cancerous derivatives at the heart of the economic meltdown. As Gretchen Morgenson of The Times reported last year, Moody's sins during the subprime frenzy included upgrading its rating of securities underwritten by Countrywide Financial, the largest mortgage lender, after Countrywide complained that the ratings were too tough. 
 Since then, more details have emerged in this unsavory narrative. When the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Countrywide's former chief executive, Angelo Mozilo, with securities fraud and insider trading this month, it produced e-mails from 2006 in which Mozilo referred to his company's subprime loan products as ''toxic'' and ''poison.'' Mozilo wrote that ''we have no way, with any reasonable certainty, to assess the real risk of holding these loans on our balance sheet.'' Yet Moody's didn't warn the public by downgrading Countrywide's securities until the summer of 2007. Meanwhile, this supposed watchdog for investors, which, like other credit-rating agencies, is paid by the very companies it monitors, took its own tranche of the bubble. Moody's profit margins even surpassed Exxon's.
 And how have it and its peers in the credit-ratings game fared in the Obama regulation crackdown? Incredibly enough, they can still collect fees from the companies they grade. ''It is as if Hollywood studios paid movie critics to review their would-be blockbusters,'' wrote Eric Dash in The Times. 
 Non-Wall Street Americans who signed on to Countrywide's toxic loans are doing far less well. The White House stood by passively this spring as banking lobbyists mobilized to castrate the administration's Helping Families Save Their Homes Act. The final version eliminated the key provision that would have allowed judges to lower the principal for mortgage holders whose homes are worth less than their loans. Dick Durbin, the Democratic senator from Illinois, correctly observed in April that the banks are ''still the most powerful lobby'' in Congress and that ''they frankly own the place.'' 
 The banks' influence at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue is also conspicuous. The revolving door between the government and Wall Street is as greasy as ever in this White House. It's all too depressing that the administration enforced its no-lobbyists policy to shun a human-rights advocate, Tom Malinowski, a lobbyist for genocide victims in places like Darfur, but granted Geithner a waiver to appoint a former Goldman Sachs lobbyist, Mark Patterson, as his chief of staff. 
 Obama is very eloquent in speaking of the ''culture of irresponsibility'' that led us to the meltdown, but that culture isn't changing so much as frantically rebranding. A.I.G. is now named A.I.U., and has employed no fewer than four public relations firms, including one whose bipartisan roster of shills ranges from the former Hillary Clinton campaign strategist Mark Penn to the former Bush White House press secretary Dana Perino. 
 Taxpayers are paying for that P.R., having poured $170 billion-plus into A.I.G. But we still don't have a transparent, detailed accounting of what was going down last fall when A.I.G. and its trading partners, including Goldman, snared that gargantuan cash transfusion. Perhaps if there had been a thorough post-crash investigative commission emulating the Senate investigation led by Ferdinand Pecora after the crash of 1929, we would now have reforms as thorough as F.D.R.'s. It was because of the Pecora revelations that Glass-Steagall was put in place. 
 If you watch CNBC, of course, the recovery is already here, and the new regulations will somehow stifle it. The market is up, sort of. Even some bank stocks are back. Unemployment, as Obama reminds us, is a lagging indicator. And so, presumably, are all the other indicators that affect most Americans. One in eight mortgages is now either in foreclosure or delinquent, with the share of new mortgages going into foreclosure reaching a record high in the first quarter of 2009. Credit card debt delinquencies are up 11 percent from last year in that same quarter. 
 The test for Obama issimple enough. If the fortunes in American households rise along with Wall Street's, he is home free -- even if his porous regulatory fixes permit a new economic meltdown decades hence. But if, in the shorter term, the economic quality of life for most Americans remains unchanged as the financial sector resumes living large, he'll face anger from voters of all political persuasions. When the Fox News fulminator Glenn Beck says ''let the banks lose their tails, they need to,'' he illustrates precisely where right-wing populism meets that on the left.
 It's still not too late for course correction. Before rolling out his financial package, Obama illustrated exactly what's lacking when he told John Harwood on CNBC: ''We want to do it right. We want to do it carefully. But we don't want to tilt at windmills.'' 
 Maybe not at windmills, but sometimes you do want to do battle with fierce and unrelenting adversaries, starting with the banking lobby. While the restraint that the president has applied to the Iran crisis may prove productive, domestic politics are not necessarily so delicate. F.D.R. had to betray his own class to foment the reforms of the New Deal. Lyndon Johnson had to crack heads on Capitol Hill to advance the health-care revolution that was Medicare. So will Obama for his own health-care crusade, which is already faltering in the Senate courtesy of truants in his own party, not just the irrelevant Republicans. 
 Though television talking heads can't let go of the cliche that the president is trying to do too much, the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll says that only 37 percent of Americans agree. The majority knows the country is in a crisis and wants help. The issue has never been whether Obama is doing too much but whether he will do the big things well enough to move us forward. Now that the hope phase of his presidency is giving way to the promised main event -- change -- we will soon find out.
