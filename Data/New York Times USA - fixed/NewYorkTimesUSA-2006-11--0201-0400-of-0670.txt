HEADLINE: Dark Plots Conceived In a Tudor Setting

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

DATELINE: Garden City, N.Y. 

 BODY:
MIDWAY through the acknowledgments in his 21st novel, ''Wild Fire'' -- which reached the No. 3 spot at Amazon by lunchtime on Nov. 6, the day it was released -- Nelson DeMille tells his readers that he is following a trend among writers to thank famous people for ''inspiration, non-existent assistance, and/or some casual reference to the author's work.'' He proceeds to extend his gratitude to the former Secretary of Defense, William S. Cohen, for once saying something nice about his books; to Paris Hilton, for belonging to a family whose hotel chain carries them in gift shops; and to Don DeLillo and Joan Didion, whose names appear before and after his in almanacs and lists of American writers. ''Thanks,'' he writes, ''for being there, guys.'' 
 No one visiting Amazon will learn that customers who bought, say, ''Night Fall,'' Mr. DeMille's fictionalized account of the story behind the crash of T.W.A. Flight 800, also bought ''White Noise'' or ''Salvador.'' Though he is a writer of topical political thrillers, Mr. DeMille is not the kind of genre writer with whom the literary-minded tend to experiment. His success during the past three decades, however, has marched on unimpeded. At 63, he is among the best-selling writers in recent history, with more than 30 million copies of his books in print worldwide.
''Stephen King once told me he liked my writing,'' Mr. DeMille said in the vast and impeccable white kitchen of his new home here. ''And that was great.''
 Mr. DeMille is a conspiracy theorist of jovial disposition, someone who assigns truth to the most horrifying avenues of speculation without, it would seem, allowing his darker convictions to dampen an otherwise fine time. 
 His newest book imagines a government plot, set in motion by a band of aging neoconservatives, to destroy two American cities as a means of justifying an attack that would eradicate the Islamic world. Originally, he'd thought to make the villains evangelical Christians, he said, but decided against it. The responsibility of preventing the catastrophe falls to John Corey, a recurring character, an agent on an antiterrorist task force who is prone to puerile sex jokes and fantasies about sitting around in his underwear eating chili.
 Mr. DeMille explained: ''I thought to myself, what is everyone's worst fear? Nuclear terrorism in America. So why write anything else?''
 Mr. DeMille, a builder's son and self-described Rockefeller Republican, began conjuring this particular insidious scenario while building his new house, one he designed largely himself, and recently completed after four years. It is a home oddly suited to the peculiarities of his sensibility -- a 10,000-square-foot Tudor full of light and free of the ominous qualities of that architectural style. It replaced a 1923 shingle-style house built on the lot by a business partner of Howard Hughes.
 On a tour, Mr. DeMille pointed out that the heating system is completely computerized. ''If we were in Florida, we could change the temperature of each room,'' he said. ''Have we ever done that? No.'' 
 The intricate slate roof seems a point of pride. Mr. DeMille employed specialists from Normandy, who spend summers installing such roofs on the north shore of Long Island, to attach it. 
 No one is ever made to travel too far to powder one's nose in his home. It has 10 bathrooms, in no small part because his fiancee, Sandy Dillingham, loves them. The bathroom off the master bedroom has five layers of Venetian plaster, a ceiling painted cerulean and a Murano glass chandelier that Ms. Dillingham designed. 
 ''I've always loved Tudors, but I really wanted a Roman bath,'' Mr. DeMille said. 
 The author and his fiancee, 41, met a number of years ago when she served as his publicity escort on a book tour that took him through Denver. They stayed in touch and became romantically involved four years ago. On Oct. 23, they had a son, James Nelson, Mr. DeMille's third child.
 ''Initially, Sandy and I didn't have much to say to each other,'' Mr. DeMille said. ''It wasn't exactly what I'd call a high boil.'' Eventually, though, they found that they enjoyed each other's company, and now, as he writes at his Web site, he is ''head over heels in love.''
 Mr. DeMille, who has two adult children from a previous marriage, grew up in post-World War II Long Island and stayed here to study history and political science at Hofstra University before serving a stint in Vietnam. 
 ''I had a very strong desire to be successful at something,'' he said. ''There are writers who say, 'Oh, if I don't write the big book, I'm going to kill myself.' That was never me. I had other ideas -- the law was one of them -- and I'd also thought about becoming an architect.''
 After a series of odd jobs as a young man, Mr. DeMille tried his hand at writing police procedurals, beginning in 1973. He produced a number of them before turning out the first book that would make him a good deal of money, ''By the Rivers of Babylon,'' which told the story of two Concorde jets, filled with passengers bound for a United Nations peace conference, which were forced to crash-land and then were besieged by Palestinian terrorists.
 ''I wrote the book in 1977, when the whole idea of Mideast terrorism was a relatively new phenomenon,'' he said. ''Thomas Harris had written 'Black Sunday' in the early '70s, which dealt with this, and it was a big best seller. If you were a thriller writer, you were writing about the Cold War and nuclear Armageddon, so what Harris did was unusual, and I was really inspired by it.''
 In 2000, Mr. DeMille's book ''The Lion's Game'' envisioned an American commercial jet taken over by a Libyan terrorist who gasses everybody on board. As a result, after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the ''Today'' show and other TV programs asked him to appear. 
 ''I declined every interview,'' he said. ''As a novelist, I had nothing to add, and as someone with something to sell, it would have only seemed exploitive.''
 The idea for the book had come to him after speaking with acquaintances in the F.B.I. and the New York City Joint Terrorist Task Force. ''These guys were all obsessed with the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center, and they were convinced we'd be attacked again,'' Mr. DeMille said.
 ''Night Fall,'' his immediately previous novel, revolves around the theory that Flight 800, which exploded over the south shore of Long Island in July 1996, was taken down by a surface-to-air missile. Mr. DeMille, who gained access to eyewitness transcripts of the crash through the Freedom of Information Act, remains a proponent of this version of events. 
 ''You just kept hearing the same story over and over again, people who'd said they'd seen a streak of light coming from the ocean, followed by a huge explosion in the sky,'' Mr. DeMille said. ''The animated film explaining the crash was made by the C.I.A. Why was the C.I.A. involved?''
 A conspiracy theorist's library is a place one expects to find shelves full of books about the falsities perpetrated by the Warren Commission. Mr. DeMille's, instead, has some detective novels, books on Tudor architecture and a collection of essays on crime-fighting by his friend Jeanine Pirro. 
 ''I read Time, Newsweek and The Economist,'' Mr. DeMille said. ''I haven't read any fiction in two years.''
 Except, Ms. Dillingham reminded him, ''the books you've blurbed.'' Mr. DeMille laughed. Some time ago, he said, he was asked to comment on the manuscript of ''The Da Vinci Code.'' Mr. DeMille did not predict the eventual fuss. ''I said, 'This is ridiculous! It makes no sense,' '' he recalled. ''And, well, we all know what happened with that.''
 Unlike some of his peers -- James Patterson comes to mind -- Mr. DeMille does not produce his books with co-writers. Rather than turning out three or four books a year, he commits to no more than one about every 18 months or so. Each takes at least a year to research and write, he said. And he writes in longhand, leaving his assistant to type his drafts. House-building -- and infants -- can slow things down even further.
 ''It's been a long time between babies,'' Mr. DeMille said. ''But the first time out, I didn't have anything; my wife had to quit working. I think it's going to be a little easier this time around.''

HEADLINE: Afghans Losing Faith in Nation's Path, Poll Shows 

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Afghans have lost a considerable amount of confidence in the direction of their country over the past two years, according to an extensive nationwide survey released Wednesday. 
 While the national mood remains positive on the whole, the number of people with negative or mixed views on the trajectory of the country has grown significantly since a similar survey in 2004, according to the Asia Foundation, which conducted both surveys. 
''The number of Afghans who feel optimistic is lower than on the eve of the 2004 presidential elections,'' the survey found.
 It was the largest opinion survey conducted in Afghanistan. In it, 44 percent of Afghans interviewed said the country was headed in the right direction, compared with 64 percent in 2004 on the eve of the first democratic presidential elections in Afghanistan. Twenty-one percent said the country was headed in the wrong direction -- compared with 11 percent in 2004 -- and 29 percent had mixed feelings. Four percent were unsure. Security was the main reason for the increased concern, the survey said.
 Financed by the United States Agency for International Development, the survey was conducted by the Asia Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, and by local partners, who interviewed more than 6,000 people from June through August this year in rural and urban areas of all but two of Afghanistan's provinces. The main goal of the survey was to determine the attitudes of Afghans toward the political process, public policy and development progress.
 The national mood was almost identical across the different ethnic groups, but varied according to region.
 Security was the main source for optimism among those who said the country was headed in the right direction. But among those who expressed pessimism, more than half said the biggest problem was a lack of security, the Taliban threat and warlords. Indeed, two southern provinces were excluded from the survey due to extreme security problems. 
 Respondents listed the economy and unemployment as other big issues. Fifty-four percent said they felt more prosperous than they had under the Taliban, but 26 percent said they felt less well off. On a local level, unemployment was cited as the biggest problem, while security and a lack of infrastructure and basic services like electricity and water featured less prominently.
 Corruption, which has become one of the main criticisms of the government, was less of a concern for respondents than unemployment and lack of services, with only 8 percent naming it as the biggest problem locally. But when asked specifically if corruption was a problem nationally, 77 percent of respondents said it was, and 60 percent said it had increased.
 The survey showed strong support for democratic elections, and strong approval of new national institutions, including the Afghan National Army, of which 87 percent approved, and the Afghan National Police, of which 86 percent approved. A similar amount expressed trust in the electronic media, and 57 percent in nongovernmental organizations, whose performance has often been criticized. The justice system, local militias and political parties were not trusted, the survey said.
 Eighty-six percent supported equal rights for women. Freedom of speech also received wide support.
 Deep respect for religion also was apparent. Sixty-one percent said religious leaders should be consulted on issues and problems. Sixty percent of those surveyed said an Islamic nation could attain democracy without becoming Westernized, while 35 percent said democracy challenged Islamic values.

PERSON: Sid Davis

HEADLINE: Sid Davis, 90, a Filmmaker Of Cautionary Tales for Youth 

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Sid Davis, a prolific educational filmmaker of the 1950s and '60s whose cautionary movies -- from ''The Dangerous Stranger'' to ''The Bottle and the Throttle'' -- sought to terrify an entire generation of young people into straitlaced middle-class obedience, died on Oct. 16 at his home in Palm Desert, Calif. He was 90. 
 The cause was lung cancer, his family said. 
A former Hollywood stand-in for John Wayne, Mr. Davis was considered one of the foremost practitioners of the social-hygiene film. Originally underwritten by Mr. Wayne, Mr. Davis's work took on a range of subjects that most educational filmmakers considered taboo: sex, drugs, alcohol, rape and molestation.
 Mr. Davis lost count of all the films he made, but there seem to have been at least 150, perhaps as many as 200. His best-known titles, familiar to legions of baby boomers, include ''The Terrible Truth'' (about marijuana); ''Name Unknown'' (juvenile delinquency); ''Why Take Chances?'' (flying kites in rainstorms and other heedless acts); ''Girls Beware'' (sex) and ''Seduction of the Innocent'' (marijuana, barbiturates and general depravity).
 The movies are squarely in the tradition of cautionary literature for children, whose best-known example is probably ''Struwwelpeter,'' the German tale of the dreadful fate of a dreadful child, which has been traumatizing young miscreants since the mid-19th-century. Mr. Davis's films, most live-action, some animated, are 16-millimeter equivalents. They are small mirrors of postwar anxiety in an age when juvenile delinquency was perceived as a looming threat.
 The Sid Davis universe is fraught with peril. Every transgression -- a swig from a bottle, a drag on a cigarette -- leads to swift and certain doom, usually in under a half-hour. Among the series of unfortunate events to which Mr. Davis's young protagonists fall victim are these: abduction, murder, rape, stabbing, robbery at gunpoint, falling off a cliff, suffocating in an abandoned refrigerator, being burned to a crisp, being stuffed into the trunk of a car, being run over, pregnancy, venereal disease, unemployment, time in pool halls, time in prison, myriad auto accidents, heroin addiction (a direct result of smoking marijuana), prostitution (ditto) and bad hair (ditto).
 Even by the standards of independent filmmaking, Mr. Davis's budgets were minuscule. He made several of his early pictures for just $1,000 apiece. He directed and photographed most of his work himself, featuring friends, family members and local police officers in the cast.
 To modern audiences, Mr. Davis's work can look like high camp. Some of his films have aged strikingly badly, in particular ''Boys Beware,'' which warns of the dangers of child molestation at the hands of roving, predatory homosexuals. (Mr. Davis played one of them in a brief cameo.)
 But a few films have artistic merit even now, Rick Prelinger, a historian of nontheatrical films, said in a telephone interview yesterday. Among them, he said, are ''Gang Boy,'' made with real gang members and notable for its social realism and fantastic dream sequences. He also cited ''Age 13,'' about a youth growing up poor in Southern California. Both films were directed by Arthur Swerdloff.
 Sidney Davis was born in Chicago on April 1, 1916, the son of a housepainter and a seamstress. The family moved to Los Angeles in 1920, and as a boy, Sid found work as an extra in Hollywood films. To help support his parents, he dropped out of school in junior high. (Mr. Davis would later make ''The Dropout,'' cautioning against just such a course of action.)
 From 1941 to 1952, Mr. Davis, a strapping man of over 6 feet, worked as Mr. Wayne's stand-in. He became a filmmaker in 1950, after his young daughter, Jill, seemed unimpressed by parental warnings about strangers. Borrowing the money from Mr. Wayne, Mr. Davis made ''The Dangerous Stranger,'' in which several children accept rides and are never heard from again.
 His other films include ''Vandalism,'' ''Gossip,'' ''Too Young to Burn,'' ''What Made Sammy Speed?,'' ''Say No to Strangers!,'' ''ABCs of Walking Wisely,'' ''Alcohol Is Dynamite'' and ''Keep Off the Grass.'' 
 Mr. Davis's wife, the former Norma Henkins, whom he married in 1941, died in 1996. He is survived by his companion, Shirley Friesen, and one grandson.
 Also surviving is Mr. Davis's daughter, Jill Davis, who as a child was shown being impaled by an errant pair of scissors in ''Live and Learn.''

HEADLINE: Cellphone Service in Subway Stations Still a Gleam in the Bidders' Eyes

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
Hello? Hello? Are you still there? 
 Like a dropped wireless call, the once-animated debate over cellphones in the subways has gone silent. At least in public.
It has been nearly 10 months since the Metropolitan Transportation Authority received four bids from companies interested in bringing cellphone service to the subway system's 277 underground stations. 
 The agency has yet to announce a winner. Straphangers who groan at the prospect of being surrounded by fellow commuters yakking on their cellphones, or think being connected could be crucial in the event of a terrorist attack, will have to keep waiting to learn if underground cell service will become a reality. 
 The authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, said in a recent interview that officials were ''in discussions'' with the bidders, who submitted proposals in January outlining how they would install and operate the system and how much they would pay the authority.
 While he would not go into details, some of the bidding participants suggested that the authority was moving slowly toward a decision.
 James D. Taiclet, chief executive of American Tower, a leading developer of wireless communication sites, said his company submitted a revised bid about two months ago, ''based on feedback from the transit authority on our initial bid.''
 He said that he had originally expected the authority to choose a winner last spring. He added that he anticipated a response to his company's latest bid before the end of the year, but that he had been given no indication of when a final decision would be made. 
 The system would be limited to the stations and not extend into the tunnels. 
 ''This really hasn't been done in the U.S. on this wide a scale,'' he said. ''It's very complex technically, very expensive, large capital expenditures. You've got multiple parties, the operator of the system, the carriers and the M.T.A., all of whose interests ultimately have to be aligned to make it successful.''
 He added, ''We're being patient.''
 Mr. Taiclet said the underground stations posed technical challenges that were similar to those encountered in the large above-ground structures, like casinos, convention centers or shopping malls, where his company has installed cellphone systems because regular wireless service was spotty or absent. 
 Mr. Taiclet would not share details of his company's bid or say how it had changed, because he did not want to provide information that might give an advantage to his competitors.
 Another bidder, a group of companies that include Dianet Communications, a small company that builds and operates wireless systems, and Nab Construction, said through a spokesman that it was still in talks with the authority, although it had not been asked to submit a revised bid. 
 In response to a question, the spokesman, Howard J. Rubenstein, said the group, which has formed a company called Transit Wireless, had hired former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato as a consultant. 
 ''He is hired as a consultant to give strategic advice,'' Mr. Rubenstein said. ''He is a very experienced person.'' He added that Mr. D'Amato ''is not functioning in any way as a lobbyist.''
 Mr. D'Amato's contacts with the transportation authority have drawn attention in the past. Tamir Sapir, the landlord of a building leased by the authority at 2 Broadway, in Lower Manhattan, has said that he paid Mr. D'Amato $500,000 to help iron out a disagreement with the authority in 1999, when the agency was led by a friend of Mr. D'Amato's, E. Virgil Conway. 
 Mr. D'Amato is also considered a close friend of the authority's current chairman, Mr. Kalikow. Mr. D'Amato's consulting company, Park Strategies, rents office space in a building owned by Mr. Kalikow at 101 Park Avenue. 
 Christopher P. D'Amato, Mr. D'Amato's son and a senior vice president of Park Strategies, said that the firm had not had contact with the authority regarding the solicitation and that his father had not discussed it with Mr. Kalikow. He said Park Strategies arranged a meeting between some members of the bidding team and officials at the authority in early 2004, to suggest that the agency install a subway cellphone network. Mr. D'Amato said the meeting resulted in no commitment from either side.
 A third bid was submitted by a consortium of four large wireless carriers, Cingular Wireless, Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile. Clay Owen, a spokesman for the group, said he could not provide information about the group's talks with the authority. 
 The fourth bidder has not been identified. 
 The project is no stranger to delay. The authority issued its request for proposals in August 2005, and the deadline for bids was pushed back three times, largely because of questions in the telecommunications industry about what the project would entail. 
 Some companies said they refrained from bidding because they did not feel it was economically feasible to wire the stations and not the tunnels, since subway riders spend far more time on the moving trains. But Mr. Taiclet said that at least two factors would motivate the major cellphone carriers to use a station-only system. First, if one carrier was able to offer underground service, even in a limited fashion, the others would feel they needed to go along in order to remain competitive.
 He also said that even relatively short periods of time every day spent talking on cellphones or using them to get e-mail or search the Web would add up.

HEADLINE: Newark Mail, But Postmark Is for Town Next Door

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: NEWARK, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
It may involve just a little splotch of ink barely noticed on discarded envelopes, but a recent decision by the United States Postal Service to discontinue the Newark postmark is causing a fair amount of consternation in a place desperately trying to bulk up on self-esteem. 
 Starting Nov. 18, every postcard and first-class letter dropped into a mailbox here will arrive at its destination bearing the words ''Kearny, N.J.,'' stamped in an adjacent town that is known for, well, not much of anything. 
It turns out that Kearny, an industrial outpost nestled amid the swampy goo of the Meadowlands, is blessed with a more modern assemblage of mail-sorting equipment, sprawled across a single level totaling one million square feet. Newark's postal distribution center, by contrast, is in two floors of a building constructed during the New Deal.
 George Flood, a Postal Service spokesman, said Newark was one of a dozen places -- among them Waterbury, Conn.; Pasadena, Calif.; and Olympia, Wash. -- that will soon lose their postmarks as part of a cost-savings initiative by the Postal Service, which has suffered from the growing use of electronic mail. 
 ''It's nothing personal against Newark,'' Mr. Flood said.
 Still, the loss was described by some residents on Wednesday as a personal affront. 
 ''We're finally turning a corner, standing stronger and stronger, and this comes like a metaphorical punch to the gut,'' said Mayor Cory A. Booker, who tried unsuccessfully to prevent the Postal Service from moving the 98 sorting jobs at the Newark center to Kearny. ''By the time they told us, it was already a done deal.''
 For postal employees, the change will be more than metaphor. Jack Dougherty, president of the North Jersey local of the American Postal Workers Union, said that workers at the Newark distribution center would have to commute to jobs in other towns or even other states, and that the city would feel the economic pinch from the loss of those jobs. 
 ''They're obliterating the city of Newark,'' he said. ''It's identity theft.''
 Newark's postmark was born in 1766 as a handwritten scribble. In 1799, the city became one of the first in the nation to receive an ultra-modern hand-stamped marker from Washington. 
 Linda Caldwell Epps, president of the New Jersey Historical Society, said Newark, the nation's third-oldest city and the state's largest, deserved to keep its postmark because of where the city had come from and where it was going. 
 ''Considering that the city is celebrating a major renaissance, the timing is awful,'' she said. ''What happened to respect for tradition, for the human spirit, for culture?''
 Robert G. Rose, president of the New Jersey Postal History Society, called the decision ''the end of an era,'' and said Newark would enter the ranks of what philatelists call the D.P.O.'s, or dead post offices. ''For collectors, it's terrible news when the state's largest city loses its postal identity,'' he said. 
 But Mr. Flood, of the Postal Service, said reports of the postmark's demise were slightly exaggerated. Local companies with their own meter machines, he pointed out, will still be able to brand their junk mail, invoices and collection notices with a Newark postmark. 
 And for the purely nostalgic, he suggested going to a local post office, waiting in line and insisting that the word ''Newark'' be stamped by hand on bills, letters and holiday greeting cards.

Natallia Biahliak's two sons, Igor, 7, and Nikita, 10, started school the first week of September, just like many children across the country. 
 But while Ms. Biahliak and her husband, Andrei, watched the children in their neighborhood in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, begin the school year, they could only hear about their own children's first day in school over the telephone from Minsk, Belarus, their hometown.
Their dream of finding better opportunities and medical care for Mr. Biahliak in America has evaporated as the separated family struggles emotionally and financially. 
 Because Mr. Biahliak has brain cancer and is unable to work, he and his wife cannot afford to care for their sons. One month after they all moved to the United States in April, the Biahliaks sent their boys back to Minsk to live with Ms. Biahliak's parents.
 Ms. Biahliak communicates with her sons through e-mail. Speaking on the telephone is too difficult for them. 
 ''When it happened with Andrei's sickness, it was too much,'' Ms. Biahliak, speaking with the help of a translator, said of the painful decision to send her children back.
 Mr. Biahliak, who was a tile worker in Belarus, found out in 2005 that he had brain cancer. Doctors there removed some of the tumor, but they said that parts of it were very close to a major artery. 
 After receiving green cards to move to the United States, they moved in with a friend in Stamford, Conn., in April. But because neither of the Biahliaks speaks English, and the couple has no car, they found that their opportunities were limited. 
 They decided that New York City -- with its public transportation system, wider employment opportunities and large population of Russian-speaking immigrants -- would give them a better chance of establishing a new home. Still, it proved too hard to keep their children with them.
 To help them adjust, a friend recommended the Marks Jewish Community House of Bensonhurst, a charity affiliated with UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven beneficiaries of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In addition to providing advice and help with job applications and Medicaid enrollment, their caseworker, Yana Bril, drew on the fund for $800 to help with the Biahliaks' rent, $825 a month, and other expenses.
 The Biahliaks were Ms. Bril's first case as a social worker. On her first day of work, she read about the UJA-Federation's involvement with the fund. As soon as she met the Biahliaks, Ms. Bril thought they were good candidates for the fund.
 ''The family just got torn apart,'' she said. ''It's very, very sad, and at the same time very inspiring. They're trying to hold it together.''
 In Minsk, Ms. Biahliak, who has an economics degree, worked for the city statistics department. But her limited English prevents her from finding a similar position here. She has found work as a housekeeper and as a nanny to three sisters younger than 5. Her total take-home earnings from both jobs is $224 a week. 
 As for Mr. Biahliak, doctors at NYU Downtown Hospital removed most of the rest of the tumor, and he began chemotherapy treatments. In a recent interview, he was visibly drained, resting his head -- shaved and scarred -- on his hand.
 The absence of their sons is clearly a source of sadness for the Biahliaks. They wish they could afford a bigger apartment and airfare for the boys. But meanwhile, they are adjusting.
 ''We couldn't dream that here there was such a nice organization,'' Ms. Biahliak said in Russian. ''I would be completely lost in my problems without the help.''

HEADLINE: Brown Walks Away With $18.5 Million in His Settlement With the Knicks 

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK; Richard Sandomir contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DENVER, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Larry Brown's chaotic 331-day term as coach of the Knicks netted him $28.5 million -- or $1.24 million for each of the 23 victories he posted last season -- after he was awarded $18.5 million in a settlement with the team.
 The figures came to light Wednesday afternoon, when Brown's contract settlement was included in Cablevision's third-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the filing, the Knicks agreed to pay Brown $18.5 million to resolve their dispute -- significantly less than the $53 million Brown sought through arbitration. 
 Brown had $41 million and four years left on his contract when the Knicks fired him in June. In challenging the Knicks' decision to withhold that sum, Brown also asked for $12.5 million in liquidated damages.
 Brown was paid $10 million last season, so he walked away with $28.5 million for less than a year's work.
 The settlement was announced Oct. 30 by Commissioner David Stern, who was serving as arbitrator in the dispute. The two sides reached the agreement before Stern could render a decision. Stern also ordered all parties not to comment publicly. A Madison Square Garden spokesman cited that order Wednesday in declining to comment on the settlement figure.
 James L. Dolan, the Garden chairman and Cablevision president, indicated in June that he did not intend to address the issue publicly again.
 Although the settlement was deemed confidential when it was announced, the amount became a matter of public record because of Cablevision's status as a publicly traded company.
 It has been an expensive two months of housecleaning for the Knicks. On the same day that the Brown settlement was reached, the Knicks bought out the contract of the veteran forward Jalen Rose for about $15 million. On Sept. 29, they bought out the contract of Maurice Taylor for about $7 million. The Knicks will pay an equal amount in luxury-tax penalties on the two players' contracts.
 The Knicks failed spectacularly under Brown, despite his Hall of Fame credentials and a well-earned reputation as a reclamation artist. Brown clashed with his superiors over personnel issues, openly feuded with his star point guard, Stephon Marbury, and alienated nearly all of his players.
 After dismissing Brown, Dolan said he was fired ''for cause'' and detailed a long list of grievances that he said constituted a breach of contract. Among the allegations were that Brown undermined the team's president, Isiah Thomas, by trying to negotiate trades and that Brown violated team rules about dealing with the news media.
 Based on the fraction of the contract that Brown received in the settlement, it appears that the Knicks had a strong case when it went to Stern for arbitration hearings on Sept. 29 and Oct. 3.
 In contrast to Brown's results elsewhere, the Knicks underachieved with him as coach. Despite an N.B.A.-high $120 million payroll, they finished with a franchise-record 59 losses. Brown, a Brooklyn native who grew up on Long Island, departed with the worst record of any coach in Knicks history. He has since moved back to Philadelphia, where he coached for six seasons.
 This is the second straight job that Brown has left under adverse circumstances. In July 2005, he agreed to a $7 million buyout with the Detroit Pistons. He had three years and $21 million left on that contract when the relationship soured. Over his last two seasons of coaching, Brown has earned a staggering $42.5 million in salary and contract buyouts. 
 Brown has kept a low profile since his dismissal. His agent, Joe Glass, declined comment Wednesday afternoon, saying, ''I think Commissioner Stern's message speaks for itself.''
 It has fallen to Brown's extensive circle of friends in the N.B.A. to provide insight into his plans. They have generally been reluctant to say much.
 ''He's doing good,'' said Doug Moe, a Denver Nuggets assistant coach and a former college and pro teammate of Brown's. ''To get out of a situation that's really bad for you for some pocket change is pretty good.''
 Concerning Brown's tumultuous season with the Knicks, a position Brown once called his ''dream job,'' Moe said: ''He's probably thrilled that it's over. And you go on with your life and New York goes on with their life. It didn't work out.''
 A consummate gym rat, Brown has kept busy despite being unemployed for the first time since 1972. He has spent time with the University of Memphis team, coached by his friend John Calipari. In the N.B.A., he has standing invitations from Mike Woodson of Atlanta, Gregg Popovich of San Antonio and George Karl of Denver to visit their teams.
 ''How can you bring him here? His schedule is already filled,'' Moe said, laughing. ''I said, 'Larry, when am I going to see you?' He said, 'I'm free in July of '09.' ''
 Asked if the 66-year-old Brown missed basketball, Moe said, ''How can you miss it if you're around it every day?''

HEADLINE: SENATE IS AT STAKE 

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and IAN URBINA

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va., Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Never mind that Senator George Allen of Virginia had not conceded. Jim Webb, his Democratic opponent, claimed victory Wednesday on the strength of a roughly 7,000-vote margin.
 And The Associated Press, a widely accepted authority for calling elections, agreed with Mr. Webb, declaring Mr. Allen, a Republican, the loser.
For the first full day after the balloting, Virginia remained the focal point of American politics, with a race whose outcome will determine which party controls the United States Senate. Mr. Allen's advisers said Wednesday night that he would do nothing until a canvass of ballots was completed. But Democrats -- ecstatic at the prospect that they might have swept both houses of Congress -- were not waiting.
 ''It is virtually 100 percent that Webb is going to win the race,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who is leading the Democratic effort to take back the Senate. ''I think you can say without any hesitancy or doubt that Democrats are going to be the majority party in the Senate.'' 
 Mr. Webb began planning his transition, and aides to Mr. Allen suggested that he could acknowledge defeat as early as Thursday afternoon.
 If they hold up, the victories of Mr. Webb and Jon Tester, the Democratic Senate challenger in Montana, would give the Democrats control of the Senate for the first time since 2002 and control of the entire Congress for the first time in a dozen years. 
 Mr. Webb, taking a page from the Republican playbook in the contested presidential vote count in Florida in 2000, tried to cast his victory as inevitable. But Mr. Allen's advisers on Wednesday still held out the possibility of a recount. 
 Aides to Mr. Webb began referring to him as Virginia's senator-elect, and this afternoon he issued a news release naming three members of his transition team.
 Democratic Party officials and some news organizations, including MSNBC and The A.P., declared Mr. Webb the winner of the election with a margin of less than one-half of 1 percent out of more than 2.3 million ballots cast. A candidate can request a recount in Virginia if the vote difference is less than one percentage point.
 State officials were conducting a rapid canvass of the vote as part of a formal certification of the result. They could be done by Thursday afternoon, officials said.
 Members of the Allen camp said earlier in the day that they expected the review would cut into Mr. Webb's lead, but stopped short of predicting that it would reverse the outcome.
 Mr. Allen will speak as soon as the canvass is done, said a senior Allen adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The adviser made it clear that if the margin did not narrow significantly, Mr. Allen would not challenge the result.
 ''He has no intention of dragging this out,'' the adviser said.
 Democratic leaders expressed certainty that their margins in Virginia and Montana would hold, giving them unquestioned control of the Senate, to accompany the grasp of the House, which they won convincingly on Tuesday.
 A concession by Mr. Allen would end a rough campaign marked by accusations of racism against him and sexism against Mr. Webb in a contest that alienated many voters, particularly women, and has apparently left the senator's once-promising political career in tatters.
 Mr. Webb, a former Republican who was secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration, ran a fairly listless campaign until the final weeks, when he adopted the persona of the warrior he was in the Marine Corps. 
 A spokeswoman for him, Kristian Denny Todd, said Wednesday that Virginia's vote-counting procedure was methodical and accurate, and expressed confidence that Mr. Webb's margin would hold .
 ''The bottom line,'' Ms. Denny Todd said, ''is the votes have been counted and Jim Webb has won. It could have gone the other way, but it didn't. We're on top, and that's the way it's going to stay.''
 Virginia election results ''rarely, rarely, rarely'' change after certification, Ms. Denny Todd said, citing a recount in a race for attorney general last year in which the margin was fewer than 400 votes both before and after a recount.
 At least one other race faced the possibility of a recount. In Florida, Vern Buchanan, a Republican, and Christine Jennings, the Democrat opposing him in the race for the Congressional seat being vacated by Representative Katherine Harris, appear headed for a recount with Mr. Buchanan ahead by 368 votes.

The kerfuffle over a Republican Party-financed advertisement denounced as injecting race into the campaign seemed to have little effect, with Mr. Ford leading by only eight points among those who thought Mr. Corker attacked him unfairly. Relatively strong support for the Iraq war among Tennessee voters made it less of an issue in this race.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Groups Get U.S. Aid Amid Meddling Charges

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Jens Erik Gould contributed reporting.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Since President Hugo Chavez returned to power after a brief coup in 2002, the United States has channeled millions of dollars to Venezuelan organizations, many of them critical of his government. This aid has become a key issue in the presidential election next month amid claims of American interference in the domestic political system.
 ''Washington thinks it can buy regime change in Venezuela,'' said Carlos Escarra, a constitutional lawyer and a leading legislator in the National Assembly who has been pushing for tighter regulation over the American financing of Venezuelan groups. ''This is an affront to our sovereignty as a nation that is not docile to Washington's interests.''
 He echoed recent comments from other high-ranking officials and from Mr. Chavez, who has a double-digit lead in most polls over his main opponent, Manuel Rosales, the governor of Zulia State. Mr. Chavez rarely refers in public to Mr. Rosales by name, instead framing his campaign as a choice between his government and the Bush administration. 
 American diplomats here have remained largely quiet in commenting on the election, which is scheduled for Dec. 3, in contrast to the active role American officials played in Nicaragua before the election of Daniel Ortega earlier this week. Government officials here exploit any example of American efforts to counter Mr. Chavez's influence as evidence of what they see as a looming confrontation with Washington.
 For instance, Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel has organized an event this week to publicize the release of ''Bush vs. Chavez: Washington's War Against Venezuela,'' a book by Eva Golinger, an American lawyer who has become famous in Venezuela for detailing the American financing of groups here.
 The United States Agency for International Development has distributed about $25 million to various Venezuelan organizations over the last five years, according to officials involved in the projects. The funds have been channeled to the Venezuelan groups through private and public entities from the United States that have opened offices in Caracas.
 These include Development Alternatives Inc., a Bethesda, Md., company that works closely with the State Department in dispersing funds around the world, and the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, two Washington groups that have carried out training for emerging political leaders in Venezuela.
 Documents obtained from the United States government under the Freedom of Information Act point to numerous grants made by the United States in the past two years to groups whose activities are viewed as critical of Mr. Chavez's government. The international development agency withheld the names of many of the grant recipients, saying that the disclosure of their identities could put them at risk of political retaliation.
 All of the grants were channeled through Development Alternatives, which worked on behalf of the Office of Transition Initiatives, a little-known branch of the international development agency that started operating in Venezuela after the April 2002 coup.
 O.T.I., which was created in the 1990s to push for democratic change in the former Soviet Union, normally finances activities in strife-torn countries like Liberia, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Its only operations in Latin America are in Venezuela and Bolivia, two countries that have developed an alliance based in part on shared distrust of the United States.
 Mr. Chavez has repeatedly lashed out at the United States government's activities, mixing his attacks with unsubstantiated claims that the Bush administration is financing covert intelligence operations aimed at strengthening his opponent's campaign. This criticism has played well among the president's political base, where anti-American sentiment has flourished since Mr. Chavez was briefly removed from power in a coup in 2002 with the Bush administration's tacit approval.
 Officials from the agency for international development did not withhold all of the identities of its grant recipients in Venezuela, as if to point out that some of the aid went to groups receiving charity in the form of baseball equipment and roofing materials. One $15,728 grant for a nutrition program went to the municipal government of Baruta, an area of Caracas whose mayor, Henrique Capriles Radonski, is an outspoken critic of Mr. Chavez.
 American officials here and in Washington say the aim of the assistance is to bring opponents and supporters of Mr. Chavez together to discuss ways to prevent the erosion of democratic freedoms. 
 ''U.S. activities, as has been publicly discussed on numerous occasions, focus on strengthening civil society in Venezuela, which is a critical element for any healthy democracy,'' David Snider, an international development agency spokesman in Washington, said in a statement.
 ''These nonpartisan activities are no different than those activities that U.S.A.I.D. supports in many other countries throughout the world,'' he added.
 But some grants were directed at organizations whose stated objectives seemed to look for potential weaknesses in Mr. Chavez's administration. One $33,304 grant in March 2005 was called ''Land Redistribution Dos and Don'ts,'' and required its unidentified recipient to investigate agricultural policies in areas where the federal government had been carrying out land expropriations.
 Other grants had what appeared to be an objective of building support for potential rivals to Mr. Chavez. A $47,459 grant, for instance, was made in July 2005 to an organization whose goal was to meet with organizations to build a ''democratic leadership campaign.''
 The agency's grants in Venezuela have raised concern among some political analysts who see parallels in efforts by Washington to destabilize the socialist government of Salvador Allende in Chile in the early 1970s or attempts to influence the domestic political system of Nicaragua in the 1980s. 
 ''I wouldn't feel comfortable with the Chinese government doing something like this in the U.S.,'' said Jeremy Bigwood, an international policy analyst at the Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington. Mr. Bigwood filed a pending lawsuit against the agency for international development this year asking that it name its recipients. He said not doing so changed it from a ''civilian to a clandestine service.''
 Meanwhile, a backlash to the American financing has been building. Prosecutors filed conspiracy charges against leaders of Sumate, a voter education group, after it received $31,000 from the National Endowment for Democracy, another entity backed by the United States government that distributes money to groups in Venezuela.
 A proposed law is also making its way through the National Assembly that would regulate international financing of nongovernmental organizations. The bill, which has been criticized by anticorruption groups like Transparency International, has been held up until after the election.
 Increased scrutiny by the government here of the American financing has been described as hypocritical by some analysts at a time when Venezuela has increased its own foreign aid in an attempt to influence the political direction of countries like Bolivia and Nicaragua.
 ''The thinking goes that if it's for the revolution, then by definition it is correct,'' said Anibal Romero, a professor of political science at Simon Bolivar University. ''But if the money comes from Washington, then it's definitely wrong.''

HEADLINE: After the Thumpin'

BYLINE: By William Safire. 
William Safire, a former Times Op-Ed columnist, is chairman of the Dana Foundation.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
''WHY all the glum faces?'' President Bush asked at the opening of yesterday's news conference. 
 Though the assembled reporters were hardly glum, conservatives of every stripe can console themselves by considering the limited scope of the Democrats' midterm sweep.
Despite the pervasive weariness with the war and the high tide of irritation at Bush's steadfastness; despite the general disgust at the policy paralysis and ethical laxity in the wake of muscle-bound one-party control -- the result was only the average loss of House and Senate seats of the party in power midway in the second term of a president. 
 A political shakeup every dozen years is a necessary cathartic for the two-party system. What's more, the rightward cast of many Democrats in the freshman class is hardly bad news for conservativism. And the heartening victory of Joe Lieberman over the angry far left in liberal Connecticut augurs a renewal of a brief period of bipartisanship at the water's edge.
 Where does our renewed two-party nation go from here?
 First, leadership is never weakened by a little humility. After what he called ''the thumpin','' the president showed he got the voters' message on Iraq: ''I recognize that many Americans voted last night to register their displeasure with the lack of progress being made there.'' But in acknowledging that ''they cast their vote for a new direction,'' he didn't wring his hands: ''The people have spoken and now it's time to move on.'' 
 Months ago, he had made provision for that ''new direction'' response -- a phrase acceptable to hawks provided the direction is not out, quick -- in the post-election report to be made by James Baker and Lee Hamilton's Iraq study group. The report should give cover to increased pressure on elected Iraqi leaders to confront the urgent needs of nationhood. 
 By placing Robert ''Fresh Eyes'' Gates, a former C.I.A. chief, on that panel, Bush paved the way for Donald Rumsfeld to absorb the need of opposition politicians for bureaucratic punishment. The loyal SecDef's resignation after the poll results was Bush's act of contrition. 
 Now the president should take the Democratic leaders up on their fine post-election expressions of bipartisanship. He's headed to Asia for an economic meeting in Hanoi. In its lame-duck session beginning next week, Congress should pass the $67 million earmark to Vietnam called for by Bush primarily for AIDS treatment. Then he should seize the initiative to get some cooperation on domestic progress during the final days of the outgoing, unlamented 109th Congress. In addition to the usual budgetary housekeeping between Thanksgiving and Christmas, both parties should make a concerted effort to deal with the most doable urgent domestic need: to resolve the fears of 12 million Hispanic ''illegals'' living in the United States.
 Bush has already proposed a comprehensive compromise: a guest worker program with earnable citizenship for those here now, as well as a border fence to stop the influx of Mexicans. But Republicans -- fearful of nativist voters shouting ''no amnesty'' -- passed only the harsh half, and that unfunded fence is a joke. Now Bush, with many Democrats already supporting his approach, should get recalcitrant Republicans to pass his fair-minded immigration package. It would be a test of both new Republican discipline and Democrats' sincerity on bipartisanship. 
 The window of bipartisan compromise can also fit a minimum wage increase tied to inheritance tax reduction; energy drilling tied to mileage standards and alternative fuels subsidy. But the window won't be open long. That's because the committees of the 110th Congress will be headed by the liberal Old Bulls eager to pass ''one-house bills'' useful only to provide hearings and make headlines.
 Committee chairmen like Charles Rangel of Ways and Means, John Dingell of Energy and Commerce, Barney Frank of Financial Services and others will crowd the airwaves with hearings grilling contractors and torturing accused torturers. 
 After a few months of this posturing, a newly emboldened Bush, emulating F.D.R.'s derision of the isolationists ''Martin, Barton and Fish,'' will be moved to denounce ''Rangel, Dingell and Frank.'' This will be the signal for new Republican leaders, like Mike Pence of Indiana, to take up the tactic of Harry Truman by denouncing ''the do-nothing 110th Congress.'' At the same time, as the 2008 primaries loom, the Trumanesque Bush will measure his reduction of troops in Iraq by the ability of the Iraqis to take over their own defense.
 That's when the new Democratic majority will suffer great stress. Senator Hillary Clinton evoked ''the vital, dynamic center'' in her victory speech, and Representative Rahm Emanuel was the model of non-hubristic responsibility during the delighted Democratic deluge. But it's hard to imagine Nancy Pelosi, Howard Dean, Kerry-Gore-Edwards campaigners and the whole loser left holding still into the snows of New Hampshire. 
 Into that incipient split of the new Congressional majority will march John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney and the other conservative, internationalist hopes. So cheer up, my fellow right-wingers, especially those of you who have grown too accustomed to winning every election night. Sometimes we have to suffer a loud, corrective slap before readying the political counterpunch.

HEADLINE: RUMSFELD RESIGNS; BUSH VOWS 'TO FIND COMMON GROUND'; FOCUS IS ON VIRGINIA

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Faced with the collapse of his Republican majority in Congress, President Bush responded swiftly on Wednesday by announcing the departure of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and vowing to work with Democrats ''to find common ground'' on the war in Iraq and domestic issues.
 With Democrats having recaptured the House and control of the Senate depending on the outcome of a single unsettled contest in Virginia, Mr. Bush, sounding alternately testy and conciliatory at a White House news conference, said he was ''obviously disappointed.'' He portrayed the results as a cumulative ''thumping'' of Republicans and conceded that as head of the party, he bore some responsibility.
In Virginia, though Senator George Allen had not conceded Wednesday night, the Democrat, Jim Webb, was confident enough of victory to begin talking about transition. Mr. Allen's defeat would mean that the Democrats would control the Senate for the first time since 2002 and would control both houses of Congress.
 Just days after telling reporters that he would keep Mr. Rumsfeld on for the rest of his term, Mr. Bush said that the two had agreed ''after a series of thoughtful conversations'' that it was time for Mr. Rumsfeld, a magnet for criticism about management of the war, to go. 
 The president asked Robert M. Gates, who was director of central intelligence under Mr. Bush's father, to take over at the Pentagon at a time when the administration is under intense pressure to develop a new approach in Iraq. 
 Senior White House officials said the Rumsfeld resignation had been discussed for weeks, coming as the violence intensified in Iraq and a growing number of critics -- including Republicans -- called for the secretary's firing. 
 Several weeks ago, with the White House's own internal polls showing Democrats making gains on antiwar sentiment, Mr. Bush and a few top aides began a series of secret meetings to discuss what he knew would be an explosive announcement. 
 Meanwhile, the president was holding heart-to-heart talks with Mr. Rumsfeld. As the longest-serving member of Mr. Bush's cabinet -- and a member of Mr. Bush's father's cabinet as well -- the defense secretary had always enjoyed Mr. Bush's unconditional public support. 
 The impending resignation was so closely held that the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, did not learn of it until Mr. Rumsfeld called him 45 minutes before it was announced. The White House was also wary about how the news might affect the election.
 ''It's like when you get asked about the dollar,'' one senior White House official said in describing why Mr. Bush gave no hint of the resignation when asked directly about it last week. ''If you don't give the same answer every time, the markets move.''
 The timing of the announcement left no doubt that Mr. Bush wanted to make a dramatic demonstration of flexibility in dealing with a war that has come to define his presidency.
 The White House said it had not yet determined whether to ask the departing Republican-controlled Senate to take up the Gates nomination or to wait for the new Senate, potentially in the hands of Democrats, to take it up next year. But Mr. Warner said he would like to see Mr. Gates confirmed by the end of the year, if possible. 
 Tuesday's vote ripped apart the political landscape in Washington just two years after Mr. Bush won re-election and declared that he intended to expend his political capital on behalf of an ambitious agenda. 
 While members of both parties said the election was about the war as much as anything, Republicans opened a debate about whether they had also been undone by failing to stick closely enough to conservative principles. Republicans in the House moved toward overhauling their leadership, and presidential contenders in both parties began preparing for an almost immediate start to the 2008 campaign.
 Democrats picked up at least 28 seats in the House, putting them in control of that chamber for the first time in 12 years. 
 By midday Wednesday, Democrats had won one of the two Senate races that had been left undecided overnight, claiming a seat in Montana from the incumbent Republican, Conrad Burns. 
 In Virginia, the Democrat, Mr. Webb, held a lead of less than 0.5 percent of the 2.3 million votes cast, aides to Mr. Allen suggested on Wednesday evening that he could acknowledge defeat as early as Thursday afternoon.
 After spending weeks questioning Democratic approaches to the economy and national security as dangerous for the nation, Mr. Bush said he recognized ''that many Americans voted last night to register their displeasure with the lack of progress'' in Iraq. He said he intended to ''work with the new Congress in a bipartisan way'' and invited leading Democrats to meet with him at the White House beginning on Thursday.
 Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who is now expected to become the first female speaker of the House, said Mr. Bush had invited her to lunch, calling her ''Madam Speaker-elect.''
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who spearheaded his party's campaign to take back the Senate, said he had received calls from Mr. Bush's press secretary, Tony Snow, and his chief political adviser, Karl Rove, as well as the president himself. Mr. Schumer said he thought it meant the White House was serious about reaching out.
 ''He was gracious,'' the senator said of Mr. Bush. ''He said, 'You did an amazing job, congratulations.' He said, 'I wish you were on my team.' And I said, 'No you don't, Mr. President.' ''
 In the Capitol, Ms. Pelosi vowed to use the first 100 hours of the new Congress to push through what Democrats dubbed their ''Six for '06'' agenda. 
 That program includes calls to raise the minimum wage, repeal subsidies for oil companies and incentives for companies to send jobs overseas, cut interest rates on student loans, give the government the authority to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower prescription drug prices, and expand opportunities for embryonic stem cell research. On one of those issues, the minimum wage, Mr. Bush signaled there was room for a deal, as he also did on immigration. 
 But Democrats made it clear that their first order of business, even before taking over in January, would be pressing the Bush White House to change course in Iraq. 
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, called for Mr. Bush to convene a bipartisan summit meeting on Iraq. Ms. Pelosi, apparently unaware that Mr. Rumsfeld's resignation was about to be announced, called pointedly on Mr. Bush to get rid of the secretary of defense, saying it would ''signal an openness to new, fresh ideas.''
 As Democrats turned their attention to governing, Republicans -- including Mr. Bush -- grappled with their losses. Although Mr. Bush had been insisting in public that he was confident Republicans would retain control of both houses of Congress, his aides said privately on Wednesday that the president knew as early as several weeks ago that Democrats were likely to capture the House, even as he hoped for an upset.
 ''If you look at it race by race, it was close,'' the president told reporters in the East Room of the White House. ''The cumulative effect, however, was not close. It was a thumping.''
 Washington has been a one-party Republican town for almost the entire six years Mr. Bush has been president. Tuesday's election ended any talk about Republicans establishing a permanent majority in the capital and upset a power structure that extended from Congress and the White House through the network of lobbyists, interest groups and donors who have supported Republicans and their agenda for years.
 ''We're going to take a two-year hiatus,'' Representative Thomas M. Reynolds of New York, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told reporters at a morning news briefing. Of Ms. Pelosi, he said: ''My goal and job will be to make sure she never sets the record that Denny Hastert set.''
 Mr. Reynolds was referring to the current speaker, Representative J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, who has held the job longer than any other Republican in the nation's history. Mr. Hastert issued a statement on Tuesday saying he would not seek the role of minority leader in the new Democratic-controlled House.
 In addition to upending the balance of power between the parties in Washington, Tuesday's election also set up a leadership scramble within the parties themselves. Two Democrats, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland and Representative John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania have both said they will seek the position of majority leader, to replace Ms. Pelosi if, as expected, she moves up to speaker. 
 And there has been speculation that Representative Rahm Emanuel, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee who is widely viewed as an architect of Tuesday's House victory, would seek the position of Democratic whip. Mr. Emanuel said Wednesday that he had not made any decision about the whip's race but would do so ''in short order.''
 At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, Mr. Bush gathered his senior aides -- Mr. Rove; Joshua B. Bolten, the White House chief of staff; and Dan Bartlett, counselor to the president -- in the Oval Office before 7 a.m. Wednesday to assess the new power structure on Capitol Hill. 
 Although the White House had been insisting for weeks that it was not planning for a Democratic takeover, those in the room were part of a small cadre of presidential advisers, also including the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, and the domestic policy adviser, Joel D. Kaplan, who had already been doing just that.
 ''We got thumped, it's time, let's go,'' Mr. Bush said, according to one person who was present at the early morning meeting. ''Let's get them on the phone. Is it too early?''
 Aides to Mr. Bush said they wanted to make some fast moves to show they were nimble in the face of the new challenge and to seize at least some of the stage on a day that belonged to Democrats. At the same time, they said, they wanted to show they had heard the voters' message that it was time for a new direction in Iraq. 
 And they said Mr. Gates was someone the president was comfortable with; Mr. Bush considered him for the position of director of intelligence, now held by John D. Negroponte. 
 Mr. Gates and the president met secretly on Sunday at Mr. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex.; to avoid the prying eyes of reporters and low-level White House officials who were camped out in nearby Waco, Mr. Gates met senior aides to Mr. Bush in the little town of McGregor and was then spirited into the ranch, aides said.
 Mr. Gates, the president of Texas A&M University, had a difficult confirmation as director of central intelligence 15 years ago because of accusations that he had slanted intelligence. Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, pledged to give Mr. Gates ''a fair and fresh look,'' despite voting against his confirmation in 1991.
 Despite the pronouncements of bipartisanship on both sides, there were questions about how Mr. Bush would work with a party whose Senate leader, Mr. Reid, has called him ''a liar,'' and whose House leader, Ms. Pelosi, has called him ''incompetent.''
 Asked in an interview on ABC News about her comments that Mr. Bush was incompetent, Ms. Pelosi replied, ''Incompetence in the implementation of a war is dangerous,'' but she quickly added that it was time to move past old conflicts.
 Mr. Bush, meanwhile, was asked at his news conference how he could have been so hopeful of Republican victory in the face of polls predicting such serious losses.
 ''I thought when it was all said and done, the American people would understand the importance of taxes and the importance of security,'' the president said. ''But the people have spoken, and now it's time for us to move on.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Gain Senate Seat With Late Count in Montana

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN; Jim Robbins contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: GREAT FALLS, Mont., Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Democrats picked up the fifth of six seats needed to win control of the Senate on Wednesday when the late counting of votes from the mining town of Butte showed Jon Tester had unseated the three-term Republican incumbent, Conrad Burns. 
 Although Mr. Burns did not concede, election officials said it would be impossible for him to find enough votes among those still to be counted to win. According to an unofficial tally posted on the Web site of the Montana Secretary of State, Mr. Tester was ahead by 2,601 votes out of 373,109 counted. 
At most, there are about 1,000 ballots still to be processed, said Bowen Greenwood, a spokesman for the secretary of state.
 ''This is a great time to take the government back, empower the middle class and move the country forward,'' Mr. Tester said in declaring victory here in Great Falls. He was named winner shortly after the area around Butte, a longtime Democratic stronghold, released its totals at mid-morning. 
 It was unclear if there would be a recount. The state will not pay for one unless the margin is less than one-quarter of 1 percent, or about 1,000 votes in this election. A candidate can pay for a recount if the margin is one-half of 1 percent, in this case about 2,000 votes. 
 Mr. Burns, who retreated to his home in Billings, did not address his supporters. In a statement, he said, ''Jon Tester ran a good race and has the lead right now, but it is extremely close. The state of Montana has a process in place and it is our obligation to see it through. There are still votes out there that deserve to be counted.''
 The defeat, according to exit polls, could be attributed in large measure to Mr. Burns's ties to Jack Abramoff, the disgraced former lobbyist who gave about $150,000 in various contributions to Mr. Burns. More than two-thirds of voters in exit polls here listed corruption as an important issue in their vote, and about half questioned the ethics of Mr. Burns. 
 Democrats had hammered away at Mr. Burns and his ties to the lobbyist, saying he had lost contact with ''Montana values.'' 
 In Mr. Tester, an organic farmer from a homestead on the prairie outside a little town with barely 700 people, the Democrats offered a candidate who looked as if he had just stepped from a hoedown inside a High Plains grange. He was a music teacher and soil conservation district leader before running for the State Senate, where he served as president this year. 
 Mr. Tester said he was against gun control, and the USA Patriot Act, the law that President Bush promoted as an essential tool to fight terrorism. 
 When Republicans attacked him for opposing the law, Democrats responded by suggesting the law could infringe on gun rights. 
 ''The Democrats were able to neutralize the social issues and hammer away at economic and fairness issues,'' said Jerry Calvert, a professor of political science at Montana State University in Bozeman, ''and that's what you need to do in this part of the country to win.'' 
 Mr. Tester will make a striking physical presence in the capital: he is a big man with a large belly, a buzz cut and three missing fingers on his left hand. He was probably the only major candidate for Senate who took time off in the heat of a campaign to harvest his crops. 
 Mr. Burns tried to save his office by reminding Montanans of his power to bring home the bacon. Behind in the polls for the most of the election, Mr. Burns closed the gap to nearly a dead heat as he kept telling people how much money he was bringing back to Montana, a poor state with a population of less than a million.
 Professor Calvert said a late visit last week by Mr. Bush, and two visits by Vice President Dick Cheney, probably did little to change the dynamics of the race. But he said that reminders of the federal spending Mr. Burns took credit for probably brought many voters back to his side. 
 ''I think what made it so close was Burns's constantly reminding people of how much money he brought to the state,'' Mr. Calvert said. ''People may have said, 'Oh, my God, we can't lose him. What about all that money?' ''
 The victory was a triumph for Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat who is a mentor and friend of Mr. Tester. Mr. Schweitzer has helped recast the image of Democrats as more culturally conservative but economically populist. He campaigned relentlessly for Mr. Tester, drawing large crowds in the closing days of the campaign.
 Montana, a state that Mr. Bush won by 20 points in 2004, will now have two Democratic senators to go with a Democratic governor.

 BODY:

With Democrats seizing a majority in the House, elected officials from a blue region may hold sway over the national agenda in a way they have not for years.

Connecticut
 In August, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman was on the ropes, having lost in the Democratic primary to Ned Lamont, a former town selectman in Greenwich. But with the Senate split nearly evenly, Mr. Lieberman, who roared back to win a fourth term as an independent on Tuesday, will almost certainly see his power and influence rise. He is often willing to cross the aisle and vote with the Republicans, and he owes his re-election largely to heavy support from Republican and independent voters.
Mr. Lamont financed his own campaign and ran on an antiwar message. The Republican candidate, former State Representative Alan Schlesinger, was not a major factor. Mr. Lieberman, who sought the Democratic nomination for president in 2004, has been regarded as aloof by many Connecticut Democrats since 2000, when he ran simultaneously for vice president and for his own Senate seat. But while Mr. Lieberman was spurned by most Democrats this year, enough Republicans and independents sought his name to lift him to victory with almost 50 percent of the vote. 
 In a stunning pickup for the Democrats, State Senator Chris Murphy ousted Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a 12-term incumbent Republican, who won re-election in 2002 and 2004 even after her district was redrawn to include more traditionally Democratic areas.
 Representative Christopher Shays, also a Republican, fought off a tough challenge by Diane Farrell, the Democrat, to win an 11th term. Ms. Farrell ran an antiwar campaign, but Mr. Shays allied himself with Mr. Lieberman and apparently benefited from the senator's strength with Republicans. 
 In the Second District, the race remained undecided. The Republican incumbent, Rob Simmons, was virtually tied with the Democratic challenger, Joe Courtney.
 Gov. M. Jodi Rell, the Republican who succeeded Gov. John G. Rowland in 2004 after he was implicated in a corruption scandal, easily won election to her first full term by defeating John DeStefano, a Democrat.

Delaware
 There was little doubt among voters and analysts that Senator Thomas R. Carper, a Democrat, and Representative Michael N. Castle, a Republican -- two of Delaware's longest-serving politicians -- would cruise to re-election. Mr. Carper was challenged by Jan Ting, a Republican, and Mr. Castle by Dennis Spivack, a Democrat. Mr. Carper and Mr. Castle are moderate partisans, and each said he would play a pivotal role in helping to reconcile a divided Congress. In the state's closest race, for attorney general, Joseph R. Biden III, a Democrat and a son of Delaware's senior senator, defeated Ferris Wharton, a Republican and career prosecutor, by 13,000 votes.

District of Columbia
 Adrian M. Fenty, 35, became Washington's youngest mayor with an easy victory over David W. Kranich, a Republican, and Chris Otten of the Green Party. Mr. Fenty's victory could portend clashes over the fate of Chief Charles H. Ramsey of the Metropolitan Police, whom Mr. Fenty has criticized. 
 Mr. Fenty, a two-term city councilman, overcame doubts about his inexperience with a high-energy, door-to-door campaign, promising to accelerate the economic turnaround begun by Mayor Anthony D. Williams, who chose not to run again.
 In another notable race, Robert C. Bobb, city administrator under Mr. Williams, was elected school board president. He may butt heads with Mr. Fenty, who is expected to try to turn the school board into an advisory panel. 

Maine
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Republican, won re-election, as did the governor, John Baldacci, a Democrat, and the two House members, Representatives Tom Allen and Michael H. Michaud, both Democrats.
 Ms. Snowe, an influential centrist, is completing her 12th year in the Senate. She defeated the Democrat, Jean Hay Bright, a writer and organic farmer, who criticized Ms. Snowe's initial vote for the war in Iraq. 
 Mr. Allen, who won the right to represent Portland for a sixth term, and Mr. Michaud, who won a third term from a vast district in northern Maine, may have more power when the Democrats organize the House next year.
 Governor Baldacci won a second four-year term. But more than half the voters supported his Republican challenger, State Senator Chandler Woodcock, or an independent candidate, State Representative Barbara Merrill.
 By a vote of 54 percent to 46 percent, Mainers rejected a referendum question that would have set statutory limits on spending by state and local governments. Supporters said the measure, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, would rein in spending and hold down taxes. But opponents said it could lead to drastic cuts in social services, education and law enforcement.

Maryland
 A brief flirtation with Republican leadership ended this year with Democrats sweeping major races, including the battles for governor and an open Senate seat. Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., who four years ago became the first Republican elected governor since Spiro Agnew, conceded defeat yesterday morning to Mayor Martin O'Malley of Baltimore, ending the most expensive governor's race in state history. 
 Analysts said Mr. Ehrlich's defeat appeared to be largely about partisan whiplash in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans two to one. ''Ehrlich ran a very competitive race, but partisanship really defeated him,'' said Paul S. Herrnson, a professor of government at the University of Maryland. 
 Benjamin L. Cardin, the longtime Democratic congressman, won a hotly contested race to succeed Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, a Democrat who is retiring after 30 years. Mr. Cardin defeated Lt. Gov. Michael S. Steele, a Republican, by just over 10 points in a contest pitting issues against image. Mr. Steele, who is black, distanced himself from the party line but had limited success courting black voters and edging away from voter discontent over the war in Iraq. Mr. Cardin voted against the war and played up his educational and environmental record. 
 ''Steele's problem was worse than Ehrlich's,'' said Thomas F. Schaller, a political science professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. ''He had to answer questions on Iraq.'' 
 Democrats kept their six-to-two majority in House races, with incumbents winning across the board and John P. Sarbanes, a Democrat and the son of Senator Sarbanes, picking up Mr. Cardin's seat. The Montgomery County state's attorney, Douglas F. Gansler, a Democrat, won the race for attorney general.

Massachusetts
 Ending 16 years of Republican control of the governor's office, Deval Patrick, a former assistant attorney general in the Clinton administration, was elected the Bay State's first black chief executive. Mr. Patrick will be the nation's second black governor since Reconstruction.
 He trounced Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey, a Republican, and two others to succeed Gov. Mitt Romney, who is retiring after one term to explore a presidential run in 2008. The state's last Democratic governor, Michael S. Dukakis, left office in 1991.
 Turnout was so heavy that some Boston precincts ran out of ballots; city officials had replacement ballots delivered in police cruisers.
 Mr. Patrick offered voters a compelling biography. He grew up poor on the South Side of Chicago, received undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard and was the Justice Department's top civil rights officer from 1994 to 1997, before working as a lawyer for Texaco and Coca-Cola. This was his first run for elected office. 
 Although Massachusetts elected Edward W. Brooke, an African-American, attorney general in 1962 and senator in 1966 and 1972, court-ordered desegregation in the 1970s opened an ugly chapter in Boston's racial history.
 Paul Y. Watanabe, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, said Mr. Patrick became a symbol of hope and inclusion, even as he played down the race issue in the campaign.
 Jeffrey M. Berry, a political scientist at Tufts University, credited Mr. Patrick with running a superb primary campaign in which he handily defeated two better-financed opponents. But in the general election, he said, ''Any Democrat probably would have won easily.'' 
 Mr. Patrick faces formidable tasks; perhaps the biggest is putting into effect a landmark law requiring all state residents to obtain health insurance by July. 
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy easily won an eighth term, defeating the Republican Kenneth G. Chase. The state's 10 House incumbents, all Democrats, were re-elected. A ballot measure to allow local authorities to license food stores to sell wine was defeated.

New Hampshire
 New Hampshire was the stage for striking Democratic success Tuesday night, as both House seats, occupied by Republicans, were won by Democrats. The Second District in particular had been viewed as vulnerable in recent weeks, and both parties poured money and celebrity into the state, including a last-minute visit from Laura Bush, the first lady. But it was not enough to stem the rising antiwar sentiment that ultimately contributed to the defeat of both Republicans.
 Paul Hodes captured the Second District seat that Representative Charles Bass had held for 12 years, winning by a larger proportion than expected (52.6 to 45.5 percent). 
 The First District was the bigger shock, as Carol Shea-Porter, a relatively little-known antiwar Democrat, defeated Jeb Bradley, 51.5 to 48.5 percent. 
 ''For a while now, the demographics of the state have been changing -- it has been getting bluer,'' said J. Mark Wrighton, an associate professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire. ''You add to that a fairly popular incumbent Democratic governor and a national tide in favor of the Democratic Party, and you get what happened here in the state last night.''
 Gov. John Lynch easily won re-election over Jim Coburn.

GOVERNOR

Lynch: 298,206 73.9%

New Jersey
 Thomas H. Kean Jr., a Republican, channeled most of his efforts to take away Robert Menendez's Senate seat into portraying Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, as a man of flawed character, more interested in lining his pockets than in promoting the good of his constituents. But in this reliably blue state, voters seemed to care less about possible ethical lapses than the state of President Bush's presidency and the war in Iraq. Those issues, in the end, gave Mr. Menendez the edge.
 Exit polls showed that about half of the voters rated corruption as an ''extremely important'' factor in shaping their decision. Nearly an equal number of them cast their ballot for Mr. Kean as for Mr. Menendez, a sign, perhaps, that mudslinging was not the most effective weapon of either campaign.
 Two-thirds of the voters said they opposed the war in Iraq, and three out of four of them voted for Mr. Menendez, who garnered similarly strong support from those who disapproved of Mr. Bush's presidency. Additionally, Mr. Menendez, who was appointed to the Senate by Gov. Jon S. Corzine in December, drew votes from a traditional Democratic coalition of women and labor. Mr. Kean earned the support of the state's smaller conservative bloc.
 Albio Sires won Mr. Menendez's former House seat in two rounds of balloting that give him the post for the remaining two months of Mr. Menendez's term and the full congressional term, which starts in January. Mr. Sires became the state's second Hispanic elected to Congress.

SENATE
98.9 % reporting

Menendez: 1,159,642 53.1%
Kean: 973, 895 44.6%

New York
 The transformation of upstate New York from a Republican bastion to fertile ground for Democrats took a leap forward, abetted by the national backlash against the war in Iraq and various Washington scandals.
 Democrats took away three Republican-held Congressional seats and came close to gaining three more -- mostly in traditionally Republican areas -- and captured all the statewide offices for the first time in more than 60 years, building on their usual dominance downstate with powerful performances upstate, as well.
 Eliot Spitzer was elected governor with the largest share of the vote in state history, 69 percent with nearly all precincts reporting, and 63 percent upstate. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton won 67 percent of the statewide vote in her re-election, and 60 percent upstate. They each carried 59 counties, losing only three small, rural upstate counties.
 Attorney General-elect Andrew M. Cuomo narrowly carried upstate but comfortably won his race, which until recently was considered a tough contest. Even Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, scarred by recent scandal and threatened with the possibility that he could be removed from office, easily won re-election and ran nearly even with his opponent upstate.
 Democrats took two Congressional races in Republican-leaning regions: Michael Arcuri won the central New York seat held by Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican who is retiring, and John Hall defeated Representative Sue Kelly in the Hudson Valley. Kirsten Gillibrand unseated Representative John E. Sweeney in a solidly Republican district stretching from the Hudson Valley to the Adirondacks.
 Three upstate Republicans -- Representatives James Walsh, Thomas Reynolds and John R. Kuhl -- narrowly survived strong challenges.
 But little changed in the State Legislature, where three decades of divided control will continue, with Republicans ruling in the Senate and Democrats in the Assembly.

Pennsylvania
 Democrats scored big victories, toppling a conservative Republican senator, ousting four Republican House members and trouncing a Republican who challenged the state's popular governor.
 The senator, Rick Santorum, held the No. 3position in the Senate Republican leadership and was an outspoken opponent of abortion rights and gay marriage.
 Bob Casey, the state treasurer and son of a former governor, easily defeated Mr. Santorum, whom he described as a rubber stamp for the Bush administration.
 After representing Pittsburgh suburbs in the House for six years, Representative Melissa A. Hart, a Republican, lost to Jason Altmire, a former health care executive and onetime aide to a Democratic member of Congress.
 In Bucks County, outside Philadelphia, a freshman Republican, Representative Michael G. Fitzpatrick, was narrowly defeated by the Democratic challenger, Patrick Murphy, an Iraq war veteran and former prosecutor. Mr. Murphy's antiwar message resonated with many voters.
 The other Republicans who lost their seats, Representatives Curt Weldon and Don Sherwood, were touched by scandal.
 Federal agents are investigating whether Mr. Weldon used his influence to help his daughter, a registered lobbyist, win consulting contracts.
 Mr. Weldon, a 10-term veteran representing a suburban district outside Philadelphia, was defeated by Joe Sestak, a retired vice admiral. 
 In the northeast corner of Pennsylvania, Christopher Carney, a Democrat, unseated Mr. Sherwood, a four-term veteran who acknowledged having an extramarital affair with a Peruvian immigrant less than half his age. Mr. Carney, an associate professor at Pennsylvania State, once worked at the Pentagon. 
 In the Sixth District, Lois Murphy, a lawyer and Democrat, narrowly lost her bid to oust Representative Jim Gerlach, a Republican who won a third term. 
 Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat, easily beat back a Republican challenge from Lynn Swann, a former football star with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Rhode Island
 Senator Lincoln Chafee, the most liberal Republican in the Senate and a vocal opponent of the war in Iraq, was widely admired throughout the state.
 But in a state where 63 percent of voters told exit pollsters they wanted the Senate to change hands, and where registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by more than three to one, Mr. Chafee's party affiliation was enough to get him voted out of office. 
 He will be succeeded by Sheldon Whitehouse, a former state attorney general and former United States attorney whose positions on the issues have been indistinguishable from Mr. Chafee's in many respects. He is a Democrat.
 Throughout the campaign, Mr. Whitehouse held up Mr. Chafee as a supporter of President Bush and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, and their policies, despite Mr. Chafee's record of against-the-grain votes. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld's resignation yesterday buoyed Mr. Whitehouse further. 
 ''The Democrats campaigned on a promise that we could bring change,'' Mr. Whitehouse said. ''I didn't quite expect it to happen so fast.''
 His victory ended three decades of Chafees representing Rhode Island in the Senate. Mr. Chafee took the seat in 1999 after his father, John H. Chafee, died in office. The elder Chafee had held the seat since 1976.
 Democrats poured money into Rhode Island and mounted one of their most successful get-out-the-vote operations there. It was almost strong enough to sweep away the Republican governor, but with 51 percent of the vote, Gov. Donald L. Carcieri squeaked out a victory over the Democratic lieutenant governor, Charles Fogarty.
 The state's two Democratic congressmen were easily re-elected.
 Voters rejected a proposal to give the Narragansett Indian tribe and Harrah's exclusive rights to operate a casino. The measure failed with 63 percent of voters rejecting it. Opponents had criticized it as a ''no-bid deal'' for Harrah's.

Vermont
 In the Senate race, Vermont voters embraced their state's independent streak, electing Representative Bernard Sanders, a longtime independent who proudly calls himself a ''democratic socialist,'' to succeed Senator James M. Jeffords, who is retiring. 
 Mr. Sanders defeated Richard Tarrant, a Republican businessman who spent $7 million of his own money on the race. Mr. Sanders promised to fight for the interests of working families and immigrants and to work to end the war in Iraq. 
 Mr. Jeffords left the Republican Party in 2001 -- a defection that turned control of the Senate over to the Democrats for 19 months. He is retiring for health reasons.
 State Senator Peter Welch, a Democrat, won the House seat vacated by Mr. Sanders. Mr. Welch defeated Martha T. Rainville, a Republican who recently retired as adjutant general of the Vermont National Guard.
 Gov. James Douglas, a Republican, easily won re-election by defeating Scudder Parker, a former state senator and former chairman of the state Democratic Party. 
 This means that one of the few places where Howard Dean, the national Democratic Party leader, cannot boast of winning the governor's mansion is in his home state.

West Virginia
 Senator Robert C. Byrd, first elected to the House in 1952 and to the Senate in 1958, is the longest-serving senator in United States history and a few years shy of having the longest Congressional tenure. He easily won a ninth term, defeating John R. Raese, a businessman and former state Republican chairman. 
 The victory came after a campaign that like many others nationwide had its nastier moments. At one point Mr. Raese disparaged the physical condition of Mr. Byrd, who is 88. And Mr. Byrd had suggested earlier that his opponent's late father would be ashamed of his son's candidacy. 
 All three House incumbents, two Democrats and one Republican, were re-elected.

 Re ''Democrats Take House'' (front page, Nov. 8):
 So President Bush is not ''the decider.'' We, the American people, are -- as it was meant to be.

 I watched, disheartened, as our country grew sicker and sicker. On Tuesday, it proved that its legendary self-healing abilities were still in good working order. 

Anne Bernays
Cambridge, Mass., Nov. 8, 2006

To the Editor:
 Now that our electorate has finally woken from its stupor, we should ask ourselves why it took six years to recognize the incompetence and demagogy of this administration and the responsibility of the Republican leadership that blindly followed its lead. 
 The damage done is enormous, in Iraq, in the United States and around the world. Years have been squandered while the critical issues of our time have gone unattended. 
 How and why were we fooled?
 We have a fascination with personalities instead of policy, a desire to be entertained rather than enlightened, and a need to have an enemy to define us and give our lives meaning.
 Thankfully, our democracy is still functioning, though we will not see really meaningful progress until we can disconnect the electoral and legislative processes from the flow of corporate cash. 
 Let's not forget that the Senate voted to give President Bush authority to start a war in Iraq. Our euphoria should be short-lived, and our vigilance should be redoubled.

 Re ''A Loud Message for Bush'' (news analysis, front page, Nov. 8):
 It's almost too good to believe the American people have done the ''almost'' impossible using the greatest democratic process known to man, the vote! 
 A president so convinced of his power and his mandate has been handed a message: ''You wasted your power and your mandate to act without consensus. The people have shouted, Enough! No more abuses of the Constitution and our freedoms; no more disregard for the values our forefathers fought hard to establish; no more 'I am, therefore I can!' ''
 Thank you, my fellow Americans, for taking back our great country and for putting us back on the path to leadership and greatness in America and the world!

 Re ''A Loud Message for Bush'':
 To President Bush et al.: 
 Here's why we Democrats won: For six years, even though the Republicans barely won their elections (if they won at all: see the 2000 election), they have disregarded us, scorned us and demonized us.
 The debacle in Iraq is not the problem; it's a symptom of profound arrogance. Here's the ''loud message'': We don't like being ignored.

Westfield, N.J., Nov. 8, 2006

To the Editor:
 The shift in power in Washington is the result of a desire by midterm voters to cut the engines of President Bush's wayward ship of state.
 That most of us regard the present course as being disastrous is shown by the fact that we made this change with no clear, unified ideas as to how to plot a better path.
 We can only hope that the White House will get the message, accept this verdict and unbend somewhat from its rigid ideology.
 While there is certainly a need for an accounting by the Bush administration on many matters, the investigative powers that the Democrats have gained are not means for revenge. 
 Any true wrongdoing must be brought to justice, of course, but our most immediate goal should be to stanch the bleeding in Iraq.
 As is so often the case, the way out of this mess seems to lie somewhere in the middle ground. We must all be prepared for sacrifice, to seek compromise where we can find it and tolerance where we can't.
 Like it or not, we are all Americans, all with a common fate. And we're in trouble.

Reese Lloyd

To the Editor:
 As a Republican, I suppose I could go on and on with excuses for Tuesday's debacle, but nothing would change what has happened, so let's look at the bright side. It should be clear to all that much of the recent spike in violence in Iraq was an effort to affect our election.
 With this out of the way now, perhaps there will be less of this bloodshed and the Iraqi government can get a handle on the pacification of the country and give us a legitimate reason to leave. 
 Also, with the election out of the way, the Democrats will have less need to carp at the administration; at the very least, they should start coming up with some solutions of their own.
 I am hopeful that as much as the Democrats enjoy railing against the wealthy, productive element of our society, they will not kill the tax cuts that have led our economy out of recession and given us the best economic numbers seen in a long time.

Geoffrey W. Bramhall
Bronxville, N.Y., Nov. 8, 2006

To the Editor:
 While voters may have identified Iraq, the economy or scandals as the issues that were important to them, I am convinced that it is the incompetence of this administration that was the foundation for the Democratic victory. 
 Its incompetence in every sphere belied its claim that there were pros now running the country. 
 The list of failures is long. Here is my abbreviated list: 
 Failing to heed clear warnings and evidence before 9/11; failure to believe the intelligence on Iraq's ''weapons of mass destruction''; failure to address health care costs; Katrina, of course; failure to address energy concerns; failure to address global warming; and failure to accept scientific principles. 
 This was the foundation for the Republicans' defeat. 
 The debacle in Iraq was the catalyst. Defeat was the result.

Richard Lenter
Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
Nov. 8, 2006

To the Editor:
 As a liberal independent who generally but not always votes Democratic, I'd like to be jubilant about the results from Tuesday's election. But I can't be.
 Over the last six years, this administration has done perhaps irreparable damage to our international relations, our constitutional guarantees, our economy, our credibility on human rights, our middle class and working poor, and the environment.
 Above all, I mourn the ordinary people, Iraqi and American, killed needlessly in the administration's wrong-footed adventure in Iraq.
 I'm sure that the Democrats are sharpening their knives for their new day of leadership. Doubtless, the public will learn many disturbing things about the way our country has been run by this government.
 But this president and his enablers will continue to insist that their theory of a unitary presidency should trump every attempt to bring them to heel. They will, for example, resist every investigation, arguing that the only check on the president's power is the voters' power to displace him. 
 That opportunity was lost forever in 2004.
 The adults stand again in the doorway of the nursery, surveying the wreckage. Perhaps we can repair this mess, but I am not optimistic.

Alan H. Neff
Chicago, Nov. 8, 2006

To the Editor:
 Now that the election is over, the Republicans might appreciate some advice: If you intend to regain power, consider getting back to basics. Lower taxes, more freedom and less government are what Republicans care about. Immigration and the Iraq mess are important, too.
 Instead of paying attention, the leadership allowed members to engage in self-dealing beyond comprehension, allowed out-of-control spending and looked the other way as the system was abused.
 More advice: Consider fielding candidates who care more about the people than lining their pockets with ill-gotten gains. It's amazing what a few honest people can accomplish.
 And finally, visit your G.O.P. Web site and read the section on what a Republican is, follow the basics and maybe, just maybe, you'll be back in power one day.

Bruce Feher
Las Vegas, Nov. 8, 2006

To the Editor:
 Re ''For Democrats, Time to Savor Victory at Last'' (front page, Nov. 8): If all of the newly elected and re-elected officials remember that they are employees of the citizens of the United States and act accordingly, the American public will also be able to ''savor victory at last.''

HEADLINE: As Man of the Hour and Chairman-to-Be, Rangel Is on the Move 

BYLINE: By ERIC KONIGSBERG

 BODY:
Representative Charles B. Rangel's Town Car was doing the late-afternoon creep down Fifth Avenue yesterday, ferrying him from a conference call in his Harlem office (87 political reporters on the line at once) to a live television appearance at the Fox News studios in Midtown, when he glanced at his phone list.
 These were the calls congratulating him on his impending ascension, with the previous night's Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives, to chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee. These were calls he had to return, more than 100 since 9 a.m. But there was one particular well-wisher he was eager to get on the line: Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.
 ''Mr. Secretary, I been using your name all over the press saying I'm looking forward to sitting down with you,'' Mr. Rangel said into his cellphone. ''Finding out what your priorities are and how we can work together.'' 
 There was a silence while Mr. Paulson got in a few words. Mr. Rangel thanked him and hung up. Then he launched into his best imitation of a buttoned-up treasury secretary by way of Wall Street.
 '' 'We had a bad night last night, but I couldn't think of anybody I'd rather have as chairman of Ways and Means than you,' '' Mr. Rangel said. Then, in his own voice, he added, ''He already told me that before.''
 Mr. Rangel, 76, has been waiting for this moment a long time. In 1970, he defeated the long-serving Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and went to Washington to represent Harlem. Four years later, he got a seat on Ways and Means, which writes tax policy and oversees some of the federal government's largest entitlement programs. It was not an easy appointment to get, he recalled.
 ''Oh my God, I had the support of Governor Rockefeller and Mayor Lindsay to get on Ways and Means,'' he said. ''They were telling me I had to get on the committee to help the city. I got on to fill the vacancy left by Hugh Carey when he ran for governor. He told me I didn't endorse him until he provided me a seat on Ways and Means. I forgot about that: he's right.''
 The chairman-to-be raised his eyebrows in a manner that might be described as impish, if it were possible to imagine an imp with a bushy mustache and that slicked-back silver pompadour. Just days ago, the suggestion that a Bush administration official, much less the treasury secretary, might call to congratulate Mr. Rangel for becoming Ways and Means chairman might have seemed a bad joke. Throughout the final weeks of the campaign, the president, the vice president and legions of less prominent Republicans had warned in dire tones that a Rangel-led committee would lead the country to economic disaster. 
 ''Charlie doesn't understand how the economy works,'' Vice President Dick Cheney said in one such blast, all but promising ''a big tax increase'' if Mr. Rangel became the committee chairman.
 Mr. Rangel, who won re-election on Tuesday with 94 percent of the vote, is quick to emphasize that the years following the Gingrich revolution of 1994 made the House a lot less fun.
 ''The leadership was not interested in working together,'' he said. ''They wanted to make political statements. The frustration was so deep. I felt like I was in a house that was on fire. I was on patrol with the fire department and I had a hose, but no water came out of it.'' 
 Even so, Mr. Rangel said yesterday that he had every intention of working with Republicans to return bipartisan civility to the House. 
 ''My biggest job is convincing the Democrats, the young people especially, not to try to get even if we want to get something done,'' he said. ''Hopefully, we can find some noncontroversial issues to start with. I used to work very well with Republicans, you know. Of course, many of those people are gone now.''
 One such Republican, Clay Shaw of Florida, would have been the ranking minority member on Ways and Means, had he not lost on Tuesday in a close race. ''Charlie and I have been close friends for years, which is all too rare today,'' Mr. Shaw. 
 Together, Mr. Shaw said, they had been hoping to organize weekend retreats for committee members, get rid of the Alternative Minimum Tax and add investment opportunities to the Social Security program.
 Mr. Shaw was asked what he felt Mr. Rangel's chances were of bringing harmony to the committee. ''Well, if the ranking member is for it,'' he said. ''And of course, that won't be me.''
 In the car, Mr. Rangel said that he was not going to try to increase taxes. ''Yeah, right,'' he said. ''With the presidential veto? Of course I'm not raising taxes.''
 He returned another call, this one to Keller George, an Oneida tribal leader. ''George is going to get me a DNA test,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''I need a casino.''
 Mr. Rangel and his driver, Al, both laughed, and the moment seemed to shake him loose from the constrictions of his statesman's mantle. A moment or two later, he was asked what he thought of making President Bush's tax cuts permanent rather than allowing them to expire in 2010.
 He gave a look of mock reproach.
 ''Oh, don't do that,'' he said. ''I'm trying to start out nice here.
 ''But I'll tell you, I was just watching the president's news conference on television. It looks like he's having a little fit up there. Those exaggerated head movements. I felt so sorry for him. He acted like he didn't know where he was.''
 As for Mr. Cheney, Mr. Rangel said: ''I don't have any problem with him.'' In fact, Mr. Rangel was surprised that Mr. Cheney had singled him out in his late-campaign stump speeches. ''He doesn't normally get involved with any of this tax stuff. He's just war, war, war.''
 Mr. Rangel said he was very interested in the future use of a special room, situated on the second floor of the United States Capitol, that Representative Bill Thomas, the current Ways and Means chairman, has allowed Mr. Cheney to use. 
 ''I wonder what's going to happen to that office,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''I wonder. It's going to be my office. That's right, it is.''

 BODY:

A blue streak sweeps through the region, and a victory in a hotly contested Senate race takes center stage, announcing a new breed of Democrat.

Alaska
 Sarah Palin, a Republican and former mayor of an Anchorage suburb, became Alaska's first female governor, fighting off a comeback bid by Tony Knowles, a Democrat and former governor. Ms. Palin, a social and fiscal conservative who calls herself a ''hockey mom,'' rose to prominence by uncovering misconduct in the administration of Gov. Frank Murkowski, whom she later trounced in the Republican primary in August.
Mr. Knowles had called Ms. Palin inexperienced and said he was better positioned to help the state profit from its natural gas reserves, but Ms. Palin beat him by eight percentage points. 
 Representative Don Young, a congressman since 1973, was easily re-elected. 

GOVERNOR
99.5% reporting
Palin: 99,145 48.7%
Knowles: 82,956 40.7%

Arizona
 
 Immigration dominated the political discourse in Arizona, from a number of ballot initiatives to the closely watched Senate race. Republicans positioned themselves as hard-liners on immigration, and for Senator Jon Kyl, the incumbent Republican, the strategy paid off. He gained almost a 9-point victory against his Democratic challenger, Jim Pederson, a developer and former state Democratic Party chairman. 
 Mr. Kyl's win was a major victory for the Republicans, who lost crucial Senate races across the country and could not afford to lose a seat that was, not so long ago, solidly Republican. 
 One House seat in the spotlight was held by Representative J. D. Hayworth, a Republican first elected in 1994. But he lost to Harry Mitchell, a former state Democratic Party chairman, 50 percent to 46 percent. 
 Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, easily held onto her seat by an almost 28-point margin against Len Munsil, a Republican. 
 Immigration was an issue in several ballot initiatives, directly or indirectly. Seventy-four percent of the voters approved an initiative to make English the state's official language, but most Hispanic voters disapproved of the measure. The voters overwhelmingly passed Proposition 100, which would ban the opportunity for bail to illegal immigrants. 
 Voters narrowly rejected a measure that banned same-sex marriage, approved a measure to raise the minimum wage, passed an antismoking measure and rejected a measure that, in the hopes of increasing voter participation, would have established a $1 million ''voter reward'' lottery.

Munsil: 405, 456 35.1%

California
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger found the formula for winning as a Republican in this state that usually goes against his party: sound like a Democrat.
 Deeply unpopular less than a year ago, the governor courted the mostly Democratic Legislature, criticized President Bush and signed bills to raise the minimum wage and combat global warming. The result was a resounding victory over State Treasurer Phil Angelides as Republicans around the country -- and even around his state -- struggled.
 The national tide was seen most clearly in the re-election races of two Republican congressmen with districts near Sacramento that would usually be safe for them. Representative Richard Pombo, under fire for ties to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, lost to a Democrat, Gerald McNerney. And Representative John Doolittle narrowly won re-election over his Democratic challenger, Charlie Brown.
 Aside from governor, Democrats won six of the seven races for statewide office; they included former Gov. Jerry Brown, elected attorney general. Senator Dianne Feinstein was re-elected with almost 60 percent of the vote, the best showing in decades by a Senate candidate, in defeating Dick Mountjoy.
 Californians upheld their reputation for frequent and unpredictable use of the initiative process, voting on 13 ballot measures and taking liberal stances on some and conservative ones on others.
 They rejected an initiative to require parental notification before a minor can have an abortion and one to limit government's power of eminent domain. They also voted to reject public campaign financing, and to toughen penalties for sex offenders and require them to submit to lifetime Global Positioning System monitoring. Yesterday, a federal judge blocked enforcement of the sex offender law, ruling that it was probably unconstitutional, and ordered a hearing later this month.
 The voters also continued a pattern of being averse to taxes, but amenable to higher state debt. They approved $37 billion in borrowing through bond acts for highways, housing, schools and levees, but rejected taxes on cigarettes and oil production.

Feinstein: 3,983,385 59.7%

Colorado
 The last time Colorado Democrats elected a governor and majorities in both houses of the legislature was 1958. So the election of Bill Ritter, a former Denver prosecutor, to the Colorado Statehouse felt like a watershed, capping a four-year string of Democratic victories that has turned a red state into one that is more blue.
 But the Colorado electorate did not vote in the way, say, California Democrats might have. The same night the state elected Mr. Ritter governor, and increased to four the Democrats' share of Colorado's seven-member Congressional delegation, voters also approved a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and rejected proposals to extend many basic legal rights to same-sex couples and to legalize marijuana.
 ''This is a centrist electorate,'' said Floyd Ciruli, an independent pollster based in Denver. ''In this election, voters punished Republicans, but they'll keep Democrats on a short leash unless they approach their victories cautiously.''
 Mr. Ritter, who won more than 56 percent of the vote in defeating Representative Bob Beauprez, a Republican, was born and reared on a Colorado farm. He has said that he is against abortion but committed to upholding the right of women to seek one. He portrayed himself as tough on crime but pragmatic on immigration, arguing that the construction and farm industries were being hurt by strict new immigration laws. He advocated a strong role for government in solving public problems.
 That centrist stance contrasted with Mr. Beauprez's image as a hard-line social and fiscal conservative who once backed a measure that threatened to shut down community colleges or allow state roads to go unrepaired. Independent voters supported Mr. Ritter by a huge margin.
 ''As Republicans, we've got some work to do,'' Mr. Beauprez said in his concession speech. ''There's a bit of a wind blowing out there, and it's not necessarily a warm, friendly wind.''
 In House races, the former State Senator Ed Perlmutter, a Democrat, defeated Rick O'Donnell, the Republican former chairman of a state education commission.

GOVERNOR
97.9% reporting
Ritter: 779,741 56.3%
Beauprez: 566,303 40.9%

Hawaii
 There was little suspense about the outcomes of the races for governor, Senate and the two House seats in Hawaii. 
 Senator Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat, easily held back his Republican challenger, State Representative Cynthia Thielen, to capture his third full term. He immediately renewed his promise to make the war in Iraq, which he opposes, his first priority. Gov. Linda Lingle, a Republican, overcame Hawaiian voters' anti-Republican mood to win her second term, defeating Randy Iwase. 
 Mazie Hirono, a Democrat and former lieutenant governor, defeated Bob Hogue to win the House seat in the largely Democratic Second District. In the First District, Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat, won his 9th consecutive term and 10th over all.

SENATE
99.4% reporting
Akaka: 197,731 61.3%
Thielen: 118,867 36.8%

GOVERNOR
99.4% reporting
Lingle: 202,906 62.6%
Iwase: 114,550 35.3%

Idaho
 This heavily Republican state had two surprisingly close races. 
 In one, a three-term Republican congressman, C. L. Otter, known as Butch, defeated a Democratic newspaper publisher, Jerry M. Brady, in the race for governor. The current governor, James E. Risch -- a Republican who took office in May after his predecessor, Dirk Kempthorne, became the United States interior secretary -- decided not to seek a full term but to run instead for his former job as lieutenant governor. 
 In the western of Idaho's two House districts, which Mr. Otter represents, State Representative Bill Sali, a Republican, narrowly beat Larry Grant, a Democratic lawyer. Mr. Sali, who emerged from a divisive primary with many enemies within his party, was seen as vulnerable; Vice President Dick Cheney campaigned with him, and national Republicans paid for advertisements attacking Mr. Grant.
 ''The Democrats have been closing the get-out-the-vote gap in Idaho, and yet it wasn't enough,'' said Douglas C. Nilson, a political scientist at Idaho State University, in Pocatello. ''Last-minute Republican attack ads really helped.''
 Solid majorities approved a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and rejected a proposition to limit the use of eminent domain for economic development. 
 ''We are the reddest of the red states,'' said Todd Shallat, the director of the Center for Idaho History and Politics at Boise State University. ''We're dealing with God, guns and gays. At a time when the whole nation, even in Montana, was sending Republicans packing, the Republicans swept every statewide office here.'' 
 But Mr. Shallat, a historian, said the state's demographics were changing. Boise, the capital and largest city, is growing rapidly with migrants from the Pacific Northwest and Southern California, and now leans Democratic, and an influx of Latino immigrants statewide could make future races more competitive.

GOVERNOR

Montana
 Jon Tester, a new-style Western Democrat, narrowly won his Senate race against Conrad Burns, the Republican incumbent, who had been seeking his fourth term. The victory secured at least a 50-50 tie for the Democrats in the Senate and capped a fierce contest crucial to the party's hopes of gaining control of Congress.
 Mr. Tester, the president of the State Senate, is a farmer and a part-time butcher who often waved to voters with his left hand, showing where he had lost three fingers in a meat grinder. He is a macho Rocky Mountain politician whose image was molded after his patron, Gov. Brian Schweitzer. 
 Mr. Tester's win and the victory by Bill Ritter, the Democrat in the Colorado governor's race, amounted to major triumphs for Mr. Schweitzer. 
 Mr. Schweitzer has been promoting a new image for the Democratic Party in the Rocky Mountain West, with candidates strong on gun rights and environmental protection, against free-trade deals and in favor of the death penalty, lower taxes and abortion rights.
 States once taken for granted as Republican strongholds now have a blue Democratic streak running through them.
 Mr. Burns, who as of yesterday evening had not conceded the race, was hurt by his ties to Jack Abramoff, the convicted lobbyist, having received more money from Mr. Abramoff than any other Republican. 
 Recent visits by President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney did not help Mr. Burns and might even have hurt. In exit polls, 60 percent of voters said they believed that Mr. Burns had been in office too long, and 55 percent said they disapproved of Mr. Bush's performance. 
 Voters approved an increase in the minimum wage to $6.15 and a measure banning certain state officials from becoming lobbyists too soon after leaving their government jobs. The Republican representative, Denny Rehberg, easily won re-election.

SENATE
100% reporting
Tester: 198,302 49.1%
Burns: 195,455 48.4%

Nevada
 Rural voters proved critical in Representative Jim Gibbons's triumph in the governor's race. 
 Mr. Gibbons, a Republican from Reno, defeated his Democratic opponent, State Senate Minority Leader Dina Titus, a political science professor from Las Vegas.
 ''We have one of the most solid Republican bases in the rural counties, and thank God for our rural counties,'' Paul Adams, chairman of the Nevada Republican Party, said yesterday.
 Mr. Gibbons's lead had narrowed significantly in the last month after a waitress said he had tried to force himself on her in a parking garage. The accusation, which Mr. Gibbons has denied, is under investigation.
 Senator John Ensign, a Republican, comfortably defeated Jack Carter, a Democrat who is the son of former President Jimmy Carter. And the Republicans maintained their 2-to-1 advantage in the state's House delegation.
 The Republicans also held control of the State Senate, but lost four of six statewide offices: attorney general, secretary of state, comptroller and treasurer. 
 Mr. Adams attributed the losses to ''voters looking for some change.'' Democrats maintained control of the state assembly, picking up one seat each in both houses of the Legislature.
 Voters approved an increase in the state's minimum wage, to $6.15 an hour from $5.15 an hour, for employees who do not have health benefits. The measure calls for further increases if the federal minimum wage is raised and in years when inflation is greater than 3 percent.
 Nevadans also approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would restrict the use of eminent domain; by state law, they must approve it once more before it can take effect. 
 And voters rejected separate ballot proposals that would have legalized marijuana and barred smoking in public places.

New Mexico
 One of the nation's tightest House races was still undecided yesterday.
 With 99 percent of precincts reporting, the Republican incumbent in the district around Albuquerque, Heather A. Wilson, led the Democratic attorney general, Patricia A. Madrid, by 1,364 votes. But thousands of ballots remained to be tallied in Bernalillo County, which includes Albuquerque and has far more registered Democrats than Republicans. The county clerk told The Associated Press that the counting would not be completed until tomorrow.
 Iraq was a hot topic in the campaign to represent the district, which has sent Republicans to the House for nearly 40 years. Ms. Wilson, a four-term incumbent and a former staff member of the National Security Council, sits on the House Intelligence Committee. And Ms. Madrid, who has served two terms as the attorney general, held Ms. Wilson partly to blame for inaccurate reports on Iraq's weapons programs. 
 New Mexico's Democratic senator, Jeff Bingaman, easily defeated Allen W. McCulloch, a Republican. The Democratic governor, Bill Richardson, routed John Dendahl, a Republican. The state's other two representatives -- Tom Udall, a Democrat, and Steve Pearce, a Republican -- also won re-election.

Oregon
It was a good night for the Democrats in Oregon. The party will control both legislative chambers and the governor's mansion for the first time since 1990.
 Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski, a Democrat, won a second term, and Democrats kept control of the State Senate. But they won a majority in the State House, which was controlled by Republicans. 
 By a vote of 55 percent to 45 percent, Oregonians turned down a ballot proposal that required parental notification when girls ages 15 to 17 sought abortions. They overwhelmingly approved a separate measure under which the state will use its purchasing power to negotiate discounts on prescription drugs for state residents who have no insurance coverage for them.
 The Republican candidate for governor, Ron Saxton, had described Mr. Kulongoski as a lackluster leader. But the governor took the election results as a vote of confidence. Voters rejected two ballot measures that imposed new financial constraints on the governor's plans for more spending on schools and universities, health care and public safety. Mr. Kulongoski acknowledged that some of his proposals would require higher taxes.
 All five members of the state's Congressional delegation were re-elected. The four Democrats are in line for more influential committee and subcommittee positions.

GOVERNOR
78.4% reporting
Kulongoski: 566,139 51.3%
Saxton: 470,138 42.6%

Utah
 Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Finance and Judiciary Committees, easily won a sixth term, defeating a Democratic opponent, Peter Ashdown, the founder of an Internet service provider. All three House incumbents, two Republicans and one Democrat, were re-elected.

SENATE

Hatch: 343,372 62.6%
Ashdown: 169,034 30.8%

Washington
 Maria Cantwell fell victim to the changing balance of power in Congress in 1994, when Republicans swept Democrats from control and she lost her seat after one term. Ms. Cantwell retreated from politics, only to return in 2000 and eke out a victory for the Senate seat held by Slade Gorton, the Republican.
 This time, empowered by voters' disapproval of the national Republican leadership, and as an incumbent senator, Ms. Cantwell sailed to re-election by a solid margin over the challenger, Mike McGavick, a Republican businessman.
 At her victory celebration in Seattle, when it was clear that Democrats had won control of the House, Ms. Cantwell told supporters, ''We're going to change the course in our country because tonight we're changing who is in charge.'' 
 According to a poll by The Associated Press, nearly two-thirds of Washington voters said they disapproved of the war in Iraq and President Bush's performance, and most of them said they had cast ballots for Ms. Cantwell. 
 Mr. McGavick, an outspoken critic of the Bush administration, drew most of his support from voters who strongly backed the president, according to the poll. 
 The only one of the state's nine House races not called as of yesterday evening was in the Eighth District, where Dave Reichert, a Republican seeking a second term, held a slight lead over Darcy Burner, a Democrat and former Microsoft executive. In the other races, the incumbents, six Democrats and two Republicans, prevailed.
 Ballot initiatives to repeal the estate tax and regulate eminent domain were defeated.
 The fate of a measure promoting clean energy remained unclear; voters appeared to be narrowly favoring it as of late yesterday evening.

Wyoming
 The race for Wyoming's only House seat was not settled as of yesterday evening, but the Republican incumbent, Representative Barbara Cubin, was leading the Democratic challenger, Gary Trauner, by fewer than 1,000 votes. Ms. Cubin declared victory in an interview with The Associated Press, but Mr. Trauner had not conceded. Wyoming election officials said yesterday that the vote margin was just wide enough to avoid an automatic recount. However, either candidate can request one. 
 Ms. Cubin swept into the House in 1994 as part of Newt Gingrich's ''Republican Revolution.'' But her sometimes caustic personality appeared to turn off some voters. 
 After a contentious debate in October, she reportedly told the Libertarian candidate, Thomas Rankin, who has multiple sclerosis, that if he were not in a wheelchair she would ''slap'' him. 
 ''It's things like that that have not played well,'' said Thomas Seitz, a professor of political science at the University of Wyoming.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 22, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A report about Nevada in the State by State election summary on Thursday referred incompletely to voting on smoking in public places. The ballot had two measures to ban smoking, not one. The more restrictive of the two measures was approved. Voters did not reject a ban.
Reports about Washington State in the State by State election summary on Nov. 8 and 9 referred incorrectly to a voter initiative on property rights, which was defeated. The measure would make governments pay for enacting zoning restrictions that reduce the value of private land; it would not regulate eminent domain.

 BODY:

Across the heartland, Democrats make strides at the expense of moderates and incumbents in the Republican Party.

Illinois
 The race to fill the open House seat being vacated by the Republican elder statesman Henry J. Hyde became less meaningful for Democrats after they took control of the lower chamber with key victories in other states.
 But losing it stung the Democrats nonetheless after they spent millions to support a hand-picked candidate whose compelling personal story drew national and international attention.
Tammy Duckworth lost both her legs when a National Guard helicopter she was piloting was shot down near Baghdad in 2004. Recruited by national Democrats to challenge for Mr. Hyde's Sixth District seat, she campaigned with her prosthetic legs and in a wheelchair and became a powerful symbol of the country's growing discontent over President Bush's policy in Iraq. 
 But her strong showing wasn't enough to overcome State Senator Peter Roskam's home-field advantage in suburban DuPage County west of Chicago, a heavily Republican area that kept Mr. Hyde in power for 32 years. Mr. Roskam, who supported the president, won by less than 3 percent of the vote. 
 In another closely contested House race, the Democratic incumbent, Melissa Bean, retained her Eighth District seat with 51 percent of the vote, beating David McSweeney. 
 Democrats also earned a key victory in the governor's race, with the incumbent, Rod R. Blagojevich, winning a second term despite a campaign marred by scandal. Mr. Blagojevich's administration is under federal investigation for allegations of hiring fraud and a kickback scheme in a pension program. 
 His Republican challenger, State Treasurer Judy Baar Topinka, tried to make the race a referendum on Mr. Blagojevich's ethics, but had to fend off attacks over her ties to former Gov. George Ryan, who was convicted on charges of federal racketeering and fraud. 
 But voter concerns over corruption apparently did not weigh heavily enough to unseat Mr. Blagojevich, who won by 10 percentage points.

Indiana
 Indiana, which along with Kentucky had the earliest poll closings in the country, proved to be a bellwether for Democratic victories nationwide. 
 In the Eighth Congressional District, nicknamed the Bloody Eighth because of its history of close races, the outcome was anything but. Brad Ellsworth, a conservative Democrat, trounced John Hostettler, the six-term Republican, who had a reputation as a colorful maverick. He once took a gun to the Louisville airport and said he had forgotten that it was in his briefcase.
 Mr. Ellsworth, the sheriff of Vanderburgh County, was one of three Democrats who ousted incumbents in this traditionally Republican state. Mr. Ellsworth and Mr. Hostettler agreed on many issues, opposing abortion rights, for instance, favoring gun rights and calling for tougher enforcement of immigration laws. A major difference was Mr. Ellsworth's support for an increase in the minimum wage, which Mr. Hostettler opposed. 
 In the Second District, Joe Donnelly, a lawyer and businessman, defeated Chris Chocola, who had been seeking a third term. In the Ninth District, Baron Hill, a former two-term congressman, took back the seat from Mike Sodrel, who won it from Mr. Hill in 2004. 
 Six incumbent representatives, four Republicans and two Democrats, won re-election. Senator Richard G. Lugar, a Republican, easily won re-election to a sixth term. Steve Osborn, a Libertarian, opposed him.

Iowa
 Democrats elected a governor, won control of both houses of the state legislature and, in a stunning upset, ousted Representative Jim Leach, a moderate Republican from Iowa City who had been in Congress for 30 years.
 It is the first time since 1964 that Democrats have controlled the governor's office and both houses of the legislature. 
 Mr. Leach voted against the war in Iraq, but that was not enough to secure victory in the Second District, which includes the University of Iowa. He was defeated by Dave Loebsack, a professor of politics and international relations at Cornell College in Mount Vernon.
 Mr. Loebsack framed the race as a referendum on Bush administration policies. Democrats described Mr. Leach as an ''enabler'' for more conservative Republicans.
 In some ways, Mr. Leach said, ''This is the happiest day of my life.'' He said he felt ''as if a burden has been lifted.''
 Chet Culver, the Democratic candidate for governor, defeated Representative Jim Nussle, a Republican who went to Congress as an insurgent in 1991 but became a reliable ally of party leaders. Mr. Nussle did not run for re-election to Congress so that he could concentrate on his campaign for governor.
 Democrats noted that the federal budget deficit increased in recent years while Mr. Nussle was chairman of the House Budget Committee. Mr. Culver, the son of former Senator John C. Culver, is the Iowa secretary of state. 
 In the contest for Mr. Nussle's seat in Congress, the Democratic candidate, Bruce L. Braley, a former president of the Iowa Trial Lawyers Association, defeated the Republican, Mike Whalen, who owns and operates hotels and restaurants.
 Mr. Braley, like Mr. Loebsack, campaigned against President Bush and the war in Iraq. Mr. Whalen said the war was ''the overwhelming issue.'' 
 Democrats will have at least 29 seats in the 50-member State Senate and at least 54 of the 100 House seats.

Kansas
 Gov. Kathleen Sebelius has what so many of her fellow Democrats want: popularity with moderate and conservative voters in a deep red state. And as she cruised to re-election to her second term, that popularity prompted talk of her potential to be one of the party's national stars.
 Democrats had a good year in Kansas, largely because they wooed Republicans. Paul Morrison, until recently a Republican, ran for attorney general as a Democrat and easily unseated Phill Kline, the incumbent who had been criticized for linking his campaign operation to evangelical churches. A former Republican state party chairman, Mark Parkinson, changed sides this year and was elected lieutenant governor.
 A Republican member of Congress, Jim Ryun, the former Olympic distance runner, lost his seat to a Democrat, Nancy Boyda.
 Republicans retained control of the state Board of Education, but critics of teaching evolution lost their majority.

Michigan
 Democrats took the State House for the first time in eight years, retained control over the governor's mansion and won other key races, giving the party significant control over political apparatus in the state.
 And the passage of a measure that prohibits public institutions from considering race and sex in public education, employment and contracting set the stage for litigation and similar proposals in other states.
 Economic issues like job losses in the auto industry served as an undercurrent to the elections, but the top Democratic Party official in the state said the party did a good job emphasizing local issues such as health insurance, the liability of drug companies in defective product cases, and importation of trash from Canada.
 ''Economic issues were important in the House races, but not overwhelming,'' said Mark Brewer, chairman of the state's Democratic Party. 
 In the State Senate, the Democrats were still awaiting final vote tallies on several races to see whether they would take control of that chamber.
 And as supporters of the anti-affirmative-action ballot initiative celebrated and considered the national implications of their victory, officials at the University of Michigan said they would fight the constitutional amendment in court.
 Michigan's proposal is similar to a measure approved by California voters in 1996. The Michigan campaign was backed by Ward Connerly, a former University of California regent and a wealthy black Republican from Sacramento, and Jennifer Gratz, a white woman placed on a waiting list by the University of Michigan 11 years ago.
 In other top races, Gov. Jennifer Granholm defeated the Republican candidate, Dick DeVos, and Senator Debbie Stabenow bested Michael Bouchard, a Republican.

Missouri
 Missouri has a well-earned history as a bellwether state, voting for the presidential victor every time but one since 1904. On Tuesday, Missourians seemed to reflect the national mood again, handing a Senate seat to the Democratic state auditor, Claire C. McCaskill, in one of the country's most closely watched races.
 Ms. McCaskill ousted the Republican incumbent, Jim Talent, in a race lately dominated by debate over a measure to protect stem cell research, which Ms. McCaskill supported and Mr. Talent opposed, and which passed by the same 2-point margin that Ms. McCaskill held over her opponent.
 The amendment blocks state and local governments from banning any federally permitted stem-cell research effort, including the embryonic cloning opposed by conservative Christians. A late-October advertisement featuring the actor Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson's disease, praising Ms. McCaskill as he swayed before the camera, attracted national attention -- and the opprobrium of the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who accused Mr. Fox of exaggerating his symptoms.
 According to exit polls, evangelical and born-again Christians voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Talent, but Ms. McCaskill performed strongly in the traditional Republican rural strongholds while beating Mr. Talent soundly in the cities.
 As in much of the country, the election was also in part a referendum on Iraq and the president. Fully 90 percent of McCaskill voters said in exit polls that the war was an important factor in their vote, and more than 60 percent said they voted for her to express disapproval of President Bush.
 Missourians voted to increase the minimum wage to $6.50 an hour from the federal level of $5.15. They rejected a proposal to increase the cigarette tax. 

SENATE
98% reporting
McCaskill: 1,028,920 49%
Talent: 987,383 47%

Minnesota
 In one of the most closely watched races for governor in the nation, Gov. Tim Pawlenty eked out a victory over Mike Hatch, a Democrat. Mr. Pawlenty won by a percentage point, earning 46.7 percent of the vote to 45.7 percent for Mr. Hatch. 
 In the final weeks of the campaign, Mr. Pawlenty was behind in statewide polls, a marked departure from his status as an up-and-coming star of the Republican Party, and suffered from rising local opposition to the war in Iraq. Still, holding onto his seat may have a rejuvenating effect on Mr. Pawlenty's national status in the wake of widespread Republican losses in other states.
 But the state had notable Democratic triumphs as well. In the Senate race to fill the seat vacated by Mark Dayton, a Democrat, Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat and the county attorney in Hennepin County, became the first woman elected to the Senate in Minnesota history. In a landslide victory, Ms. Klobuchar captured 58 percent of the vote to defeat Representative Mark Kennedy, a Republican who had to struggle to keep his House seat in 2004. 
 Representative Gil Gutknecht, a six-term Republican, lost his seat to Tim Walz, a teacher and former member of the National Guard, 52 percent to 47 percent.

Klobuchar: 1,279,515 58%

Nebraska
 Nebraska appeared largely untouched by the Democratic wave that swept over many other states.
 The state's Congressional delegation will continue to have just one Democrat, Senator Ben Nelson, who easily won a second term by defeating Pete Ricketts, the Republican. But Mr. Nelson, a former governor and state insurance director, prides himself on being able to work with President Bush and other Republicans.
 State Senator Adrian Smith, a 35-year-old Republican, won an open seat in the conservative Third District, which Mr. Bush carried with three-fourths of the vote in 2004. Mr. Smith said he was inspired to run for public office by President Ronald Reagan, whom he has admired since the fourth grade. 
 Mr. Smith defeated Scott Kleeb, a Yale-educated rancher who was endorsed by the conservative Omaha World-Herald, the state's largest newspaper. The seat has been held for six years by Representative Tom Osborne, a former football coach for the Nebraska Cornhuskers who made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for governor.
 Gov. Dave Heineman, who won the Republican primary, sailed to victory in the general election, defeating his Democratic challenger, David Hahn, a political newcomer. Mr. Heineman, a former lieutenant governor, became chief executive in January 2005, after Mr. Bush chose Gov. Mike Johanns to be secretary of agriculture.

North Dakota
 There may be no state whose voting habits are harder to pin down. North Dakotans vote heavily Republican for president and state offices, yet for many years they have sent only Democrats to Congress.
 Senator Kent Conrad and the state's only representative, Earl Pomeroy, both won re-election by roughly two to one over little-known challengers, Dwight Grotberg and Matt Mechtel. That was a marked change for Mr. Pomeroy, who has had some close races. 
 Voters also showed their conservative side in approving a constitutional amendment limiting state and local governments' power to seize private property to transfer it to another private owner for economic development. North Dakota was one of several states with such measures on the ballot.

SENATE

Conrad: 149,317 68.8%

HOUSE

Pomeroy: 142,121 65.6%
Mechtel: 74,364 34.4%

Ohio
 Voters brought the Republicans' monopoly over Ohio politics to a dramatic end.
 Ted Strickland, the Democratic candidate for governor, garnered more than 60 percent of the votes in defeating his Republican rival, J. Kenneth Blackwell. Sherrod Brown, the Democratic candidate for the Senate, won almost 56 percent of votes in defeating the incumbent, Senator Mike DeWine. And Democratic candidates for attorney general, secretary of state and other statewide offices also won with significantly more than 50 percent of the votes.
 Still, Democrats appeared to have gained only one seat in Congress, winning six of Ohio's 18 Congressional seats. Two races in which Republicans led by narrow margins, in the suburbs of Columbus and Cincinnati, had not yet been called yesterday.
 Driving the Democratic victories were the voters' anger with corruption in government, job losses in Ohio's crumbling industrial economy, the war in Iraq and President Bush, voters said in interviews after they cast ballots. About 6 of every 10 voters called Ohio's economy not so good or poor and said they disapproved of Mr. Bush's job performance and of the war in Iraq, according to exit polls.
 Those percentages, which matched Mr. Strickland's and Mr. Brown's margins of victory, raised the question: If as many as 60 percent of Ohio voters statewide cast ballots for Democratic candidates for governor and for the Senate, why did Democrats apparently win only 33 percent of the Congressional seats? 
 ''It's the gerrymander effect,'' said Richard Gunther, a political science professor at Ohio State University. Republicans in control of the Ohio legislature had drawn the state's congressional districts in ways that concentrate Democratic voters into some districts, thereby wasting some of their votes, while diluting Democratic votes in cities like Columbus, where the vote-rich metropolitan area is splintered into three districts that extend deeply into mostly Republican rural counties, Mr. Gunther said.
 Tuesday's victories in the races for governor and for secretary of state will give Democrats a majority on the board charged with drawing the boundaries of state legislative districts. But the power to draw Congressional boundaries rests with the legislature, both houses of which are still controlled by Republicans.
 Four candidates who support the teaching of evolution in public schools either retained or won seats on the Ohio Board of Education in all four races in which the teaching of evolution was an issue. In one of the most-watched races, Tom Sawyer, a former Democratic Congressman and mayor of Akron, defeated Deborah Owens Fink, a marketing professor at the University of Akron. Scientists at Ohio State University, Case Western Reserve University and elsewhere recruited Mr. Sawyer to challenge Dr. Owens Fink and, in an unusual move, most of the Case Western Reserve faculty signed a letter endorsing Mr. Sawyer's candidacy. Dr. Owens Fink's says children should be taught to think critically about evolution, although she no longer advocates the teaching of intelligent design. Intelligent design is an ideological cousin of creationism.

South Dakota
 A majority of voters rejected a broad ban on abortion put to South Dakotans by state lawmakers, halting an effort, at least for now, to prompt the Supreme Court to reconsider the Roe v. Wade decision.
 Abortion-rights advocates hailed the 56 percent to 44 percent vote as a reminder that most Americans support women's right to choose, but supporters of the ban were undeterred, saying they had failed to communicate their message effectively.
 ''This is a wake-up call to lawmakers in other states that America's pro-choice majority will not allow an assault on Roe v. Wade to go unanswered,'' Nancy Keenan, the president of Naral Pro-Choice America, said in a statement.
 Officials at the South Dakota group Vote Yes for Life said they were heartened by support for the measure. The group said some voters might have been confused by the measure's wording on the ballot, and others might have been turned off by anti-abortion advocates not affiliated with the campaign who used images of dead fetuses.
 ''Our biggest enemy was the outside groups that came in,'' Leslee Unruh, who leads Vote Yes for Life, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''We begged them to stay out, but they wouldn't stay out.''
 There were no significant upsets in statewide races. Gov. Michael Rounds, a Republican, and Representative Stephanie Herseth, a Democrat, easily won re-election.

Wisconsin
 A barely blue state in 2004, Wisconsin stayed Democratic again on Tuesday. Gov. Jim Doyle narrowly escaped with a re-election victory over his Republican challenger, Representative Mark Green, a four-term member of the House.
 The race was one of the most heated and divisive in decades, as candidates sparred over stem cells, the economy and taxes.
 Senator Herb Kohl, a widely popular Democrat, handily recaptured his seat for a fourth term, defeating Robert Lorge, a Republican. 
 The more revealing outcomes of the election were the results of two ballot initiatives, both indicating a rising tide of conservatism in a state that once prided itself as the home of political creativity and progressive thought under Robert M. La Follette.
 Wisconsin voters approved a measure to amend the state Constitution to prohibit same-sex unions, an initiative with wording so ambiguous that some experts have expressed concern that it could also apply to heterosexual cohabitation, said David Canon, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
 Another initiative represented a shift in opinion on the death penalty, which was abolished in Wisconsin in 1853.
 In a nonbinding state referendum, the majority of voters said they approved the reinstatement of the death penalty. Mr. Doyle has promised to veto a death penalty bill if it is passed by the State Legislature.
 Mr. Doyle will enter his second term with a host of issues to confront, including a stagnant economy, a rapid loss of manufacturing jobs and a rising budget deficit.

HEADLINE: Setting Out Into the Wilderness With Only a Knife

BYLINE: By JONATHAN GREEN

 BODY:
ON a brisk morning in October, Lee Posner, a stout New York orthopedic devices salesman, drove to a remote spot in the northern Arizona mountains, removed his glasses, unclipped his cellphone and placed them in the glove box. Then, with a deep sigh, he stepped into the cougar-infested wilderness with nothing more than a sharp knife. 
 His face was a mask of apprehension as he struck out through the thick Ponderosa pines. ''My survival will come down to this,'' he said, patting the knife (a Swedish Mora knife with a four-inch blade) at his waist as he negotiated some thick sagebrush. ''The blade will decide.''
Mr. Posner was one of three people taking a two-day course led by Tony Nestor of Ancient Pathways, an Arizona outdoor survival school that teaches survival using only primitive technology. Participants are allowed to take only a knife, the clothes they arrive in and a tiny survival kit containing parachute cord, a fire sparker and a water bottle. Tent, sleeping bag, G.P.S., camping mattress and, more important, food, are all forbidden. The idea is to learn how to survive if a day hike goes wrong. 
 Shaded under the greasy brim of a worn bush hat, Mr. Nestor hiked a few steps behind the group. ''We belong out here,'' he said, scrambling up mossy rocks with the agility of a mountain goat. ''It's our birthright. We've had a spear in our hands a lot longer than we've had a laptop. If you have knowledge, all you need out here is a knife.'' 
 Mr. Nestor, a soft-spoken man with a phlegmatic demeanor and a natural, calorie-saving economy of movement, has made it his life's work to understand how to survive in the wild with nothing. From the age of 17 he has wandered the country spending years with mountain men, Indians and outdoor survivalists to learn his craft. Proudly mounted on the living room wall of his solar-powered house in Flagstaff are the sticks he used the first time he started a fire ''in the old way.'' 
 He has become such an authority on outdoor survival, particularly desert survival, that he has taught it to Hopi and Navajo students, as well as to the Army's Special Forces before their deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan. He also trains prospective contestants on the television reality show ''Survivor'' who are eager to gain an edge.
 Mostly, though, he teaches a growing band of people intrigued with primitive technology. ''With Y2K and then 9/11, the numbers interested in this have exploded,'' Mr. Nestor said. ''A lot of people want to be less reliant, particularly after Hurricane Katrina. People want to know how to survive when the shelves at the grocery store are not filled with food and the government is not around to supply water.'' A significant number of his students are women.
 Becoming a real weekend Rambo appeals on a number of different levels. ''Modern hiking inventions are great,'' Mr. Posner said. ''But Gore-Tex is not going to find me water if I am stranded. I was a huge fan of Tarzan growing up, and I have always been fascinated with the idea of living in the wild with only a knife.''
 Elliot Spaulding, 23, an undergraduate at Northern Arizona University, agreed. ''I'm more interested in how my ancestors used to live,'' he said. ''I want to sleep in a shelter that I have made myself, in front of a fire that I have lit myself with nothing more than sticks.''
 The kind of course Mr. Spaulding and Mr. Posner were taking (this reporter was the third student) does have very real dangers. Last July, Dave Buschow, 29, a security operative from River Vale, N.J., died in Utah while taking part in a 28-day survival course run by the Boulder Outdoor Survival School. 
 After an hour of hiking up and down mountains and canyons at 7,000 feet, Mr. Nestor led the group to a clearing in the dense pine woods. ''Shelter is one of the first thing you need to take care of, whether you are roasting in the desert or freezing in sub-zero degrees,'' he said. 
 He instructed his students on how to make a primitive shelter called a wickiup. We lashed the ends of two 12-foot logs to the trunk of a tree with a half-hitch at roughly waist height, forming a steeple. We then hacked and laid branches along the sides and dropped pine needles over the top to seal it. We were left with a wigwam shape big enough for two people, along with a pie-shaped space at the front where we would build our fire pit. We then littered the floor inside with pine needles. ''You have to have something between you and the ground,'' Mr. Nestor said. ''Otherwise the ground will suck the 98.6 degrees of temperature right out of your body.'' 
 The next imperative was the hunt for water and food. We hiked deep into a tree-lined canyon, where the rocks at the bottom held rust-brown rainwater. The oasis was used as a waterhole by local animals. Mr. Nestor pointed out footprints. ''Those three-lobe prints would indicate a cougar,'' he said. Mr. Posner filled his water bottle with a wary eye on the canyon's rocky outcrops. 
 Sinewy stalks of wild onions protruded from the boggy ground around the waterhole. Mr. Nestor instructed the group to dig out the marble-size onions using our blades. It took a good hour of hard labor to collect even a cupful.
 MR. NESTOR regarded everything in the outdoors as having a utilitarian purpose. Don't have a toothbrush for the night? Cut a fresh twig from an oak tree and scrape your teeth with it; the tannin acts as a natural toothpaste. Don't have rope? Use the fibrous leaves of the yucca plant and braid them into a line which is strong enough to lash shelters or even to use as mountaineering rope. 
 We foraged a few wild cranberries and spent a further hour collecting acorns in our bandanas. But soon hunger, a chilling drop in temperature and darkness descended on the group. Mr. Nestor could tell how many hours of daylight were left by measuring how many fists there were between the sun and the horizon. ''We have an hour to get back to camp to light a fire,'' he said.
 Back at camp, we whittled wood to make fire-making implements. A bow drill consisted of a flexible piece of wood bent into a bow shape with some cord, a spindle made from yucca stalk and a flat piece of wood known as a fireboard. Mr. Spaulding pulled the bow back and forth, with a jerky, forceful momentum, spinning the spindle in the fireboard and producing a fine, hot dust. The friction eventually produced a little billowing cloud of smoke and then a few licks of flame in the withering light, just as the sun sank below a tree-lined ridge. The dust was used to light pitch from a pine tree. A blanket of complete darkness descended just as the fire gathered a roaring life of its own. ''Natural fire that I made myself,'' Mr. Spaulding said, grinning with his accomplishment.
 The group, ravenous with hunger, began the laborious process of shelling acorns, which were dropped into a rusty can we had found. Then we boiled up an acorn-and-wild-onion broth and devoured it ravenously. But we were all still hungry. Despite laboring for much of the day collecting onions and acorns we still couldn't fill our bellies.
 ''I'm so hungry I could eat a squirrel,'' Mr. Posner said morosely. Mr. Nestor explained that in an emergency situation hunting could burn up more calories, especially when there was a chance of not actually catching anything. 
 Mr. Nestor has regularly dined on pack rats, mice and squirrels on his long sojourns in the wild. ''When it's winter and there is no food on the ground, you have to eat that to survive,'' he said, shadows cast by the campfire flickering over his face. ''You can't be squeamish about it. It's a good thing our ancestors weren't or we wouldn't be here today. Mice are too small to skin, so you just throw them on the fire and eat them whole. Rats you throw on for 30 seconds to burn off bubonic plague, lice and parasites and then skin them. If you're really hungry you just eat them straight down.'' 
 The long night stretched out ahead of us. The temperature dropped to 36 degrees. The soaring darkness of the woods enclosed as the needling cold stabbed into our clothing. We lay on our beds of prickly pine needles, sticking some into our clothes for extra insulation. We fed the fire to stay warm. The smoke from the fire pit billowed into our eyes, turning them bloodshot and sooty. We either roasted in the shelter or froze when we fell asleep and the fire died. 
 A gray dawn woke us early. Despite lack of sleep and a gnawing hunger with little food for 24 hours, there was a sense of pride we had survived the night. ''There are students and advanced students,'' Mr. Nestor said, ''but no masters when it comes to outdoor survival.''
 Our trip was only a taste, but it demonstrated the brutality of life without easily accessible food, heat, light and all the other features of modern living that we take for granted. ''It's about a positive mental attitude and knowledge of the jungle,'' Mr. Posner said. ''Just like Tarzan had.''
 Mr. Nestor demonstrated signaling with a mirror to use in an emergency. The flash can be seen as far as 105 miles away by rescue workers. And with that lesson we made our escape from the wilderness. 
 Mr. Posner tucked his knife securely into the waistband of his pants and hiked back to civilization. ''Right,'' he said, safely back at his car. ''Where's a McDonald's? I want a quarter-pounder with cheese.''

HEADLINE: Declining Bill for Oil Imports Improves U.S. Trade Balance

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The gaping trade deficit that the United States has with the rest of the world shrank in September, largely because Americans imported less oil -- and paid less for it.
 The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the imbalance between exports and imports narrowed to $64.3 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis. The 6.8 percent decline, from $69 billion in August, was the steepest in nearly two years.
But the contraction in the deficit from August to September, helped by a small increase in exports, was not as straightforward as the numbers suggest. Economists said that because August's record deficit was inflated by high oil prices, the improvement in September appeared stronger than it actually was. 
 Furthermore, economists noted, the nation's trade situation continues to be far out of balance. The trade deficit now stands at $586.2 billion for the first nine months of the year, and it remains on track to break last year's record of $716.7 billion. 
 Trade with China continued to be wildly lopsided. In September, China accounted for a bigger chunk of the American deficit than any other foreign nation: $23 billion on an unadjusted basis. 
 News of the declining American trade gap came a day after China reported that its trade surplus rose to $23.8 billion in October. That was another record, far surpassing the previous high of $18.8 billion set just two months earlier.
 About a fourth of the trade deficit the United States has accumulated so far this year is attributable to Chinese imports.
 Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Southampton, Pa., said that compared with the August trade deficit numbers, the September statistics were bound to look good. ''In August, they were probably artificially bloated by the oil price increases,'' he said. The American trade gap, he said, remains ''terribly unhealthy, no matter what.''
 The drop in oil prices in September was the first since March. At the same time, the amount of oil imported also declined as the summer driving season ended and consumers continued to worry about the cost of filling their gas tanks. The average price dropped to $62.52 a barrel in September, from a record $66.12 in August, while the number of barrels imported a day fell to 10.553 million from 11.080 million.
 The trade picture was brightened in September by growing exports. The United States set a record by exporting $123.2 billion in goods and services. While the increased flow of American products abroad did not help improve the trade deficit with China, imbalances with Europe, Africa and South America narrowed.
 Growing exports and declining imports in September will help improve the nation's gross domestic product in the third quarter, economists said. The government reported last month that the economy expanded just 1.6 percent in the third quarter. Many economists said yesterday that they expected a rate closer to 2 percent when the government revises that figure this month.
 With the economy slowing -- economic growth was 5.6 percent in the first quarter and 2.6 percent in the second -- an increase in exports is one way economists think the United States can avoid a severe slowdown. 
 ''Export strength is quite impressive, and it's being driven by strong global growth,'' said Dean Maki, chief United States economist with Barclays Capital. ''We do expect global growth to continue to be strong and an ongoing source of support for the U.S. economy.''
 One byproduct of a slowdown is fewer imports, which helps improve the trade deficit.
 Edward F. McKelvey, senior economist with Goldman Sachs, said, ''I guess it's a silver lining of a slowdown.''
 Evidence of that slowdown was apparent in consumer confidence numbers released yesterday by the University of Michigan. The survey's index of consumer confidence showed a decline since October, which economists attributed to waning enthusiasm over falling gas prices.
 ''Over the last couple of months, confidence has been boosted by the sharp decline in gasoline prices,'' Capital Economics, an economics research group, said in a report yesterday. ''But the bigger concern going forward is the clear evidence of a slowdown in the housing market.''
 Also yesterday, the Labor Department reported that the number of people filing for unemployment benefits fell last week by 20,000, to 308,000. It was the latest employment report to suggest that the job market remains vibrant, another factor economists are hoping will help reduce the severity of the current economic slowdown.

HEADLINE: Turning Toughened Rules Into an Advantage 

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ind. 

 BODY:
Executives at Cummins Inc. did not expect their blessings to come in disguise, particularly when they were disguised as government regulations.
 So, when engineers at Cummins, a diesel engine maker, first saw the suggested new federal clean-air standards for their engines in the early 1990s, they argued that the standards would be impossible to meet.
After the standards became official in 2000, Cummins sued, and industry insiders started placing bets on whether the company would be one of the few to meet the technical challenges -- and survive. 
 But in October, when the Environmental Protection Agency needed a place to trumpet the success of the standards, it came here, to Cummins's headquarters. A day after the E.P.A. event, Cummins followed with more good news, announcing that it would invest $250 million to revive a partly idled plant and hire 600 workers to build state-of-the-art light duty diesel engines. 
 What had changed at Cummins, and at other diesel engine manufacturers, was not just that they had learned to adapt to tougher environmental regulations. Instead, the new, cleaner engines have become a point of pride. 
 ''Cummins is the Mark Twain of the engine business,'' said Mike Osega, the publisher of the trade magazine Diesel Progress. ''Their demise has been predicted by everyone in the last 20 years. But they keep getting better.''
 Indeed, Cummins, along with companies like Caterpillar, has led an unexpected industry revival. ''Columbus, Peoria, these were all supposed to become ghost towns,'' Mr. Osega added. ''But this whole industry has prospered. Cummins is a microcosm of what the industry is going through.'' 
 The main market in the United States for diesel engines remains trucks and heavy equipment for construction, mining and off-road transportation, like locomotive engines. But new engines, with pollution-control technology, open the way for more diesel-powered light trucks and sport utility vehicles.
 Diesel engines, the muscle T-shirts of the automotive world, may be the new black.
 Much of the clatter of the old diesel engines is gone. Pickup is improved. Light-duty diesel engines can get 30 percent more miles to the gallon than their gasoline counterparts.
 Almost half the cars sold in Europe in 2005 were diesel-powered. And the new generation of diesel engines, compliant with the standards that take effect on Jan. 1, may eventually compete with hybrids for the energy-conscious consumer in the United States.
 Cummins's revived local factory, for instance, will make light-duty engines for as-yet-unspecified new Chrysler vehicles -- probably light trucks, maybe sport utility vehicles.
 The engine manufacturers lobbied heavily for the petroleum refiners to reduce the sulfur in diesel fuel. Without much cleaner fuel, the engine manufacturers argued, the essential pollution control devices would not work and the new standards could not be achieved. 
 Thanks in part to the diesel engine makers' arguments, the E.P.A. mandated that the sulfur content of diesel fuel be cut to 15 parts per million from 500. Sulfur is a major factor in stopping the cleansing action of pollution-control equipment like catalytic converters. A result is the formation of microscopic soot, which can penetrate deep into lungs and cause serious illness. This tiny soot, or particulate matter, is the deadliest air pollutant regulated by the federal government.
 As John C. Wall, Cummins's vice president and chief technical officer, explained: ''People are always asking what are the limits of diesel combustion? The answer is it depends on what day you ask, because we've got a lot of people working hard to move those limits and we've done that over time.''
 Cummins has tailored its designs and manufacturing processes to incorporate the E.P.A.'s mandates into all its machines. The company offers truckers engines with pollution-reducing parts that are part of the Cummins family, not proprietary components from other manufacturers.
 Asked about the devices that treat the exhaust once it has left the engine, Christina M. Vujovich, Cummins's vice president for marketing and environmental policy, said: ''We didn't want to take on after-treatment just because it was sexy to do. We only wanted to take it on because it provided additional value to customers.'' 
 Mr. Wall, the Cummins vice president, said that the company did not want to get in the position where it might be blamed for a problem caused by another manufacturer's components. ''You really like to have all that in your control,'' he said, ''so that you're not at the mercy of someone else not turning up with their part of the costume.''
 Analysts are divided on the wisdom of this strategy, some sharing the belief that one-stop shopping is a virtue, others arguing that the company, by limiting the suppliers of engine components, could be cutting itself off from technological advances that might emerge elsewhere.
 Ms. Vujovich said the company's extensive contacts in engineering schools ensure access to emerging technologies.
 Pleasing the E.P.A. with an integrated, fuel-efficient, low-emissions engine is not the point of the exercise for Cummins or its big rival, Caterpillar, of Peoria, Ill., which is heavily marketing the environmental and performance attributes of its Acert engines. Rusty Dunn, a Caterpillar spokesman, wrote in an e-mail message, ''We've invested heavily in what we believe is a very competitive, clean diesel technology.'' 
 Mr. Wall of Cummins said: ''As we remind our engineers, the E.P.A. has never bought a single engine from Cummins. This is really about how do you create customer value.'' 
 Environmentalists have long embraced the notion that environmental rules can create competitive advantage, but it has not been well received in most boardrooms -- except, perhaps, companies like Corning and Engelhard, which have made huge profits on emissions-control technologies.
 In most company annual reports, environmental regulations routinely are labeled ''risks.'' But more and more, they are hard-wired into business strategy as well. 
 For instance, a smaller but fast-growing part of Cummins business is its components segment. It specializes in emissions-related engine parts like filtration systems, fuel systems, turbochargers that regulate the amount of air going into the engine and emissions-reducing technologies.
 The research budget for these businesses has grown by 45 percent, to about $57 million this year from about $39 million in 2004, the company reports. Such expenses reflect the high priority given this segment, though they also held down margins on earnings before interest and taxes, which dropped to 4.5 percent in 2005 from 6.7 percent in 2003, even as sales rose 50 percent to $2 billion.
 In 1998, the E.P.A. wrung a stringent settlement from the industry. It got the largest civil penalty in environmental enforcement to date, $83.4 million, and made seven major manufacturers reprogram devices that disabled emissions controls when the engines became hot in traffic -- what the E.P.A. called ''defeat devices.'' 
 Cummins's overall sales, like those in the rest of the industry, have boomed for three years. Industry analysts say this is a product of a mini business cycle for the diesel industry: with regulatory deadlines approaching, customers are motivated to buy the last of the old trucks to delay as long as possible the purchase of new ones with emissions controls that can add as much as $7,000 to $10,000 to the price of a $100,000 truck. 
 As Mr. Osega wrote in June, ''The '07 truck regs have spawned a long steady pre-buy.'' He went on, ''This, and a robust economy, has driven truck and truck engine sales to historical highs.'' 
 Profits and stock prices followed. Caterpillar, with a market capitalization of $40 billion, is nearly six times the size of Cummins. But Cummins has surged faster. Its net income reached $550 million in 2005, up tenfold from $54 million in 2003. Caterpillar's sales in the same period rose fourfold, to $2.85 billion from $798 million in 2003.
 But that cycle is peaking. ''Engine manufacturers and truck people are earning record profits,'' said David Bluestein, an industry analyst with UBS Warburg. ''Early next year, it's going to come to a screeching halt.''
 [On Oct. 20, Caterpillar reported record results but cut its earnings forecast for 2007. The company's stock closed at $59.20 Thursday, up slightly from a year ago, but down from last June, when it broke $80. Cummins's shares are up 29 percent for the year, though they have fallen 14.7 percent in recent weeks. They closed at $118.77 Thursday.] 
 But Ms. Vujovich and Mr. Wall said that Cummins's other businesses, like engines for power generators, combined with its ability to keep up with the new requirements in the United States and Europe, which take effect in about a year, will help cushion the expected decline in the basic truck business. And they think they have a competitive advantage going forward.
 Ivan Feinseth, an industry analyst with Matrix USA, agrees. ''They have the resources to comply,'' Mr. Feinseth said, ''and they have low-emission engines to start with.''

HEADLINE: Ford Will Delay Reporting Of Its 3rd-Quarter Results 

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Nov. 9 

 BODY:
For the second time this year, a Detroit automaker will be late filing an earnings report with the Securities and Exchange Commission because of accounting errors.
 The Ford Motor Company said Thursday that it needed several more days to finish restating previous years' earnings, the first time in recent memory that the automaker has sought an extension for a quarterly filing. Ford said on Oct. 23, when it reported a preliminary third-quarter loss of $5.8 billion, that it would have to restate its earnings since 2001 because of incorrect accounting of derivatives linked to interest rates by its finance arm, Ford Motor Credit Company.
Ford also said it would eliminate one of two shifts at a factory 10 miles from its headquarters that builds sport utility vehicles, and the Dana Corporation, an auto parts supplier, announced that it planned to close eight plants in North America. 
 Ford said it would need a few more days before it filed its third-quarter earnings report, which it expected to file by Tuesday.
 ''I think it makes sense, considering what we're looking at in terms of restating, that we might need a couple more days,'' said a Ford spokeswoman, Becky Sanch.
 The delay comes eight months after General Motors delayed filing its 2005 annual report, in which it revised its loss to $10.6 billion, from $8.6 billion. G.M. also restated earnings for the first and second quarters of this year, and earlier this week it filed a report showing a third-quarter loss of $24 million less than it had previously reported.
 Both G.M. and Ford have been grappling with slow sales, particularly of their most profitable vehicles -- trucks and sport utility vehicles -- and drastically cutting jobs and expenses in attempts to regain profitability. Nearly one-third of G.M.'s 113,000 unionized workers accepted buyout offers this summer, and Ford's 75,000 hourly employees have several more weeks to decide whether they want to take a similar offer.
 Ford said it would eliminate one of two shifts at its Michigan Truck Plant, which builds two newly redesigned S.U.V.'s, the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator. The move is expected to eliminate at least one-quarter of the 2,800 jobs at what was the world's most profitable auto plant in the 1990's, when the popularity of S.U.V.'s was at its peak.
 Ford said it was cutting production by 21 percent in the fourth quarter, to its lowest level in 25 years. G.M. and the Chrysler Group, a division of the German-American automaker DaimlerChrysler, have also reduced output because of declining market share.
 Those cuts have added to the misery being felt by parts suppliers like Dana, which said that it not only planned to close eight North American plants but would also try to renegotiate its labor contracts and seek to eliminate retiree health care costs. It also said it would reduce operations at three other plants.
 Dana, based in Toledo, Ohio, filed for bankruptcy protection in March. The company, which makes brakes, axles and other components, said it intended to reduce annual expenses by as much as $540 million.
 ''We expect to continue to move manufacturing capacity from the U.S. to lower-cost countries, such as Mexico, while maintaining and improving the productivity of our final assembly operations in the U.S.,'' Dana said in a regulatory filing. Dana currently has 46,000 employees at 116 factories worldwide, including 66 in North America.
 Its third-quarter sales were down $110 million, or 5 percent, from a year ago, although previous cost-cutting moves helped the company shrink its net loss to $356 million, from $1.27 billion last year.
 Dana did not say how many jobs would be affected or which plants would be closed, which are in addition to eight plants that have already been shut down or told they would close this year. The company's chief executive, Michael J. Burns, told employees in a letter yesterday that he would make a detailed announcement within the next month.
 Dana is one of several large suppliers operating under bankruptcy protection, which also include the Delphi Corporation and Tower Automotive. The automakers' recent production cuts have made reorganizing and emerging from bankruptcy more difficult.
 ''Dana does have some new business coming on with Ford that's going to help them stabilize the production flow through 2007,'' said James Gillette, director of supplier analysis at CSM Worldwide in Northville, Mich. ''The last four or five months were, and the next 12 months are going to be, very difficult.''

Broadway

'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included). Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called ''Little'' Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (as her bed-ridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)

'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to a demonstration, with partners including a vulture who sings ''My Way,'' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'LOSING LOUIE' This second-rate English import depicts the impact of an adulterous liaison on two generations of a family in Pound Ridge. Directed by Jerry Zaks, it's a queasy mixture of coarse comedy and soap operatic contrivances (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN' ' The brilliant Twyla Tharp interprets the Bob Dylan songbook less than brilliantly. When a genius goes down in flames, everybody feels the burn (1:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, , are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Neil Genzlinger)

'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)

*'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'EMERGENCE-SEE!' Daniel Beaty's solo show takes stock of the urban African-American mind in the new century, as dozens of men and women flock to Liberty Island when a slave ship mysteriously appears in New York Harbor. The performance captivates; the material doesn't (1:15). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'esoterica' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)

'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE HAIRY APE' The Irish Repertory Theater has put together a startling production of Eugene O'Neill's tale of a galoot called Yank who goes looking for his place in the world, one that vividly conveys what a gut-punch this work must have been when it was first seen in 1922. Eugene Lee's set is something to see, and the soundscape, by Zachary Williamson and Gabe Wood, is something to hear (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)

'LIVE GIRLS' Victoria Stewart's drama sends up the docudrama and an Anna Deavere Smith-like performance artist (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)

'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)

'MY DEAH' ''The mind of a beauty queen is a thing to fear!'' John Epperson, a k a Lypsinka, brings his love of cultural deconstruction and reconstruction to this lovably trashy spoof of a certain exalted Greek tragedy, in which a scorned woman sets about chicken-frying her own children to get even with the no-account man who done her wrong. Nancy Opel and Maxwell Caulfield lead the cast in offering big servings of honey-baked ham (1:30). Abingdon Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)

'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'PORT AUTHORITY THROW DOWN' Mike Batistick's intercultural tale of an angry Pakistani cabdriver, a white Christian missionary from Ohio, a black homeless alcoholic and the driver's activist brother is far from profound, but it has some solid laughs, and its battered heart is in the right place (2:00). Culture Project at 45 Below, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)

'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called ''Post Mortem'' by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)

'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE' A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)

'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE SUNSET LIMITED' Cormac McCarthy's elegiac two-man play distills his previous work into a debate about suicide (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)

'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)

'WRECKS' The tail wags the scorpion in the latest play by Neil LaBute to be propelled by a poisoned punch line. This slender, prickly tease of a monologue -- whose whole raison d'etre is its last-minute revelation -- is given substance by an expert performance by Ed Harris as a newly bereaved widower (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley)

Off Off Broadway

'THE FLOOD' This eager show about a deluge in an Illinois town has a majestic score by Peter Mills and Cara Reichel and an able, ingratiating cast. Unfortunately, they're playing cookie-cutter characters (2:00). The American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Rob Kendt)

'STANLEY 2006' Todd D'Amour's performance-art piece rethinks Stanley Kowalski's feelings about Blanche DuBois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' The work is striking and original but at times heavy on the angst (1:15). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)

Spectacles

'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

Long-Running Shows

'ALTAR BOYZ' This satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Van Gelder)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart and tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)

'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line,'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'ASCENSION' Brandon Ruckdashel makes a stunning debut in Edmund De Santis's clever comic mystery about a priest, a beautiful young man and a mother's accusation of sexual abuse (1:30). The Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Gates)

'THE GIVEN' Grim without being rewarding, Francine Volpe's drama involves a stripper, a gay man with H.I.V., another gay man who wants to be infected with H.I.V., and a married man who becomes a bit more than a good customer at a strip club. The playwright seems to hope that the mixture is explosive, but it's merely distasteful (2:20). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger)

'THE THUGS' Rumors of death at a law firm make Adam Bock's new play a chilling little nightmare (1:15). SoHo Rep, 46 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)

'THE TIMEKEEPERS' Dan Clancy's play, which throws a Jewish artisan and a gay hustler together in a concentration camp, transcends standard Holocaust psychodrama on the strength of its characterizations and definitive performances by Seth Barrish and Eric Paeper (1:35). Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, third floor, (212) 760-2615; closes tomorrow. (Kendt)

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'ABSOLUTE WILSON' (No rating, 105 minutes) This appreciative look at the life and work of the theater artist Robert Wilson includes a notably candid interview with the man himself, as well as mostly friendly testimony from friends and experts and glimpses of his strange, difficult and often thrillingly original work. (A. O. Scott)

'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not-quite-simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott)

* 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN,' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Manohla Dargis)

* 'CLIMATES' (No rating, 97 minutes, in Turkish) The story of a man and a woman, one of whom murders the other's love, and a haunting portrait of existential solitude. The Turkish writer and director Nuri Bilge Ceylan also stars. (Dargis)

'COMMUNE' (No rating, 78 minutes) A breezy, informal history of the Black Bear Ranch, a long-running California commune begun in the summer of 1968 and still in existence, ''Commune'' offers the fascinating spectacle of observing people then and now. (Stephen Holden)

* 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)

* '51 BIRCH STREET' (No rating, 88 minutes) The mysteries of ordinary life drive this moving, engrossing documentary, in which the director, Doug Block, tries to figure out his parents' 54-year marriage. (Scott)

* 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)

* 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)

* 'A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS' (R, 98 minutes) Rough, ragged and full of life, this autobiographical movie, written and directed by Dito Montiel, about his youth on the streets of Astoria, Queens, is a remarkable debut, stuffed almost to bursting with bold performances and operatic emotions. (Scott)

* 'JONESTOWN: THE LIFE AND DEATH OF PEOPLES' TEMPLE' (No rating, 85 minutes) The scariest aspect of this powerful, meticulously chronicled history of Jim Jones and his flock, who committed mass suicide in Guyana on Nov. 18, 1978, is that so many of the followers of this demented demagogue appear to have been intelligent, idealistic, life-loving people. Watch this documentary and shudder. (Holden)

'THE LAST ATOMIC BOMB' (No rating, 92 minutes, in English, Japanese and French) This deeply affecting look at the bombing of Nagasaki and its aftermath is seen primarily through the eyes of a 70-year-old survivor named Sakue Shimohira, a tiny, tireless woman who now devotes herself to disseminating her harrowing story. Directed by the veteran documentarian Robert Richter, the film interweaves expert interviews with a remarkable collection of declassified films and photographs. The result is an unvarnished and blatantly emotional plea for nuclear disarmament whose images speak for themselves. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

* 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)

'THE MAGIC GLOVES' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Spanish) Depression, drugs and professional stasis commingle in this limp Argentine comedy whose characters remain trapped several rungs below their aspirations. In the foreground of a featureless Buenos Aires, paths cross and lock without import, and lives inch sideways (a cab driver becomes a bus driver), in reflection of the country's larger economic blight. Yet the fleeting moments of deadpan humor are pungent enough to suggest that the writer and director, Martin Rejtman, is saving himself for greater things. (Catsoulis)

* 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott)

* 'THE PRESTIGE' (PG-13, 128 minutes) Entertaining, spirited and shamelessly gimmicky, Christopher Nolan's new film tells the intricate tale of two rival magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman) practicing their art in late-Victorian London. Scarlett Johansson is the lovely assistant. (Scott)

* 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)

'ROMANTICO' (No rating, 80 minutes, in Spanish and English) The sympathetic portrait of a mariachi musician and illegal immigrant who returns to his Mexican hometown feels more like a mosaic than a narrative film with a clearly defined continuity. (Holden)

'THE SANTA CLAUS 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE' (G, 98 minutes) Ho, ho, ho? No, no, no. (Dargis)

'SAW III' (R, 107 minutes) The franchise rasps on with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the masked sadist whose fondness for men in chains continues unabated, playing marriage counselor to a couple whose young son has been killed in a car accident. Having learned the (knotted) ropes on ''Saw II,'' the 27-year-old Darren Lynn Bousman returns to direct, while James Wan and Lee Whannell push their original story to ever new heights of monstrousness. In the end, the most depressing thing about this franchise is not the creativity of the bloodletting but the bleak view of human nature, specifically our talent for ruining the present to avenge the past. (Catsoulis)

* 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed that the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)

'UMRAO JAAN' (No rating, 145 minutes, in Hindi and Urdu) Weak dubbing and melodramatic overkill hamper this retelling of a historical Indian story, about the travails of a performing courtesan. But its star, Aishwarya Rai, a potent presence, appears destined for international success. (Andy Webster)

'UNKNOWN' (No rating, 90 minutes) This twisty thriller, which locks five men inside a dingy warehouse, where they regain consciousness with no recollection of who they are or how they got there, features a whole lot of buildup and a real letdown of a payoff. (Kern)

* 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodovar, with Penelope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)

* 'THE WILD BLUE YONDER' (No rating, 81 minutes) An artful mixture of carefully culled and originally produced material, Werner Herzog's self-described ''science fiction fantasy'' purports to tell the story of an alien species beset by misfortune. Brad Dourif stars alongside some floating astronauts and a few exquisitely beautiful underwater drifters. (Dargis)

'WONDROUS OBLIVION' (No rating, 106 minutes) Form and content fight to the death in Paul Morrison's defiantly gauzy tale of racial friction in 1960s England. As a cricket-obsessed Jewish boy (Sam Smith) comes of age under the tutelage of his Jamaican neighbor (Delroy Lindo), the boy's mother (Emily Woof) experiences an awakening of her own. Bathing everything in an inappropriately peachy glow, Mr. Morrison serves up prejudice lite, joining the ranks of too many filmmakers who suggest that sports and sexual flirtation can cure all social ills. (Catsoulis)

BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, www.bam.org; $10. (Gates)

JACQUES AUDIARD RETROSPECTIVE (Through Dec. 5) Cinema Tuesdays at the French Institute Alliance Francaise continues its five-week tribute to Mr. Audiard, a contemporary master of the French thriller.

Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5600, www.filmlinc.com; $10. (Gates)

ROBERTO ROSSELLINI (Through Dec. 22) The Museum of Modern Art's retrospective of the work of Rossellini (1906-77), the grand old man of postwar Italy's neo-realist movement, begins on Wednesday.

Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, and Celeste Bartos Theater, 5 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400, www.moma.org; $10. (Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

AND YOU WILL KNOW US BY THE TRAIL OF DEAD, BLOOD BROTHERS (Tomorrow and Sunday) Proving once again rock's inexhaustible lesson that loudness equals liberation, these two bands work their way to chaotic, cathartic peaks. Trail of Dead (as impatient fans call them), from Austin, Tex., gets there slowly and somewhat patiently, while the Blood Brothers, from Seattle, are a nonstop weapon of frantic noise and surrealist poetry (''Set fire to the face on fire''). At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario)

* 'Broadway Unplugged' (Monday) This third annual all-acoustic concert offers a rare opportunity to hear theatrically trained stars performing without microphones in an ideal setting. The many scheduled performers include John Lloyd Young, Beth Leavel, Marc Kudisch, Norm Lewis and Roosevelt Andre Credit (whose ''Ol' Man River'' last month at the Jerome Kern tribute stopped the show). At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100, the-townhall-nyc.org; $25 to $75. (Stephen Holden)

CALIFONE (Tonight) A mainstay of the Chicago experimental scene, Califone plays wistful songs with a constant, thin hum. At 8, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $12. (Sisario)

CHRISTINA COURTIN, BELL ORCHESTRE (Thursday) Continuing its series of concerts straddling classical music and experimental pop, Merkin Concert Hall presents Christina Courtin, a recent Juilliard graduate who writes tender, capricious songs in the Regina Spektor idiom, and Bell Orchestre, a Canadian quintet that likes slow, broad soundscapes and includes a French hornist -- what could be more classical than that? At 8 p.m., 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, merkinconcerthall.org; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)

THE CULT (Monday) On leave from his job as a stand-in for Jim Morrison in the touring band that features former members of the Doors (a court order prevents it from using that name), Ian Astbury returns to his first job: a stand-in for Jim Morrison in the Cult, a British band of 1980s vintage that hitched the brooding melodrama of the Doors to the bruising guitar power of AC/DC. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $40. (Sisario)

* BOB DYLAN (Monday and Thursday) On his 32nd studio album, ''Modern Times'' (Columbia), Mr. Dylan is obsessed with the mythic past, serving up a sleek, bluesy time warp that dips into Muddy Waters, Bing Crosby and the obscure 19th-century ''poet laureate of the Confederacy,'' Henry Timrod. Even when studying contemporary popular culture, he is reminded of his own back pages: ''I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying,'' he sings. ''When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line.'' With Jack White's roadhouse band, the Raconteurs. Monday at 7:30 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $39.50 to $79.50. Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $39.50 to $89.50. (Sisario)

'ENCUENTRO' (Sunday) An annual gathering of a diverse and inventive group of Colombian musicians in New York who mix traditional sounds with rock and jazz. Led by Pablo Mayor and his group Folklore Urbano, this fourth ''Encuentro'' (''Encounter'') also features Hector Martignon, Edmar Castaneda, Marta Gomez, Coba with Lucia Pulido, La Cumbiamba eNeYe and others. At 5 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $35. (Sisario)

ARETHA FRANKLIN (Tuesday) Ms. Franklin has said she intends to stop extensive touring, but she keeps coming back, to grateful crowds. After a rare appearance at the Apollo Theater this summer, she returns to the Hammerstein Ballroom. At 7 p.m., 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $75 to $500. (Sisario)

* GUNS N' ROSES (Tonight) Only Michael Jackson inspires more morbid curiosity than Axl Rose, who has spent 12 years recording the next Guns N' Roses album with a steadily rotating cast of replacements, only occasionally coming up for air and paparazzi. But he has been a common sight lately -- showing up in public (which is unusual) and completing tours (even more unusual) -- fueling speculation that the album, ''Chinese Democracy,'' might be ready for release soon. Patient fans are not holding their breath. With Papa Roach and Sebastian Bach. At 8, Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-7171, thegarden.com; $49.50 to $89.50. (Sisario)

BRUCE HORNSBY (Tonight) Mr. Hornsby spent much of the 1990s touring as the pianist with the Grateful Dead and its spinoffs, and the experience transformed his own music. Even in earnest songs, he's freer and more playful, letting loose his two-handed virtuosity so that songs dance through jazz, gospel, country, Latin music and rock. At 8, the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; sold out. (Jon Pareles)

BERT JANSCH (Tuesday) One of the prime movers of the 1960s British folk scene, Mr. Jansch played knotty and expressive acoustic guitar that influenced Jimmy Page and Neil Young, and in songs like ''Needle of Death'' sang in an invitingly guileless voice of a bohemian demimonde. He has remained productive, but two things have brought him a new audience: his appearance on the soundtrack to ''The Squid and the Whale'' last year, and his embrace by young folk stars like Beth Orton and Devendra Banhart, who both appear on his new album, ''The Black Swan'' (Drag City). At 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $15. (Sisario)

KIKI AND HERB (Wednesday and Thursday) Fresh from a run on Broadway, the world's most brilliantly perverse cabaret duo -- they've performed a medley of ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ''Frosty the Snowman'' -- begins a series of late-night shows in the intimate Joe's Pub. At 11:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario)

AMY MILLAN, ERIC BACHMANN (Thursday) When indie rockers dabble in country music, they tend to lose their sense of humor entirely. Ms. Millan, the guitarist of Stars, a band from Montreal that plays witty and sophisticated songs, cries a river of twang on her one-dimensional new solo album, ''Honey From the Tombs'' (Arts & Crafts), and Mr. Bachmann, under his own name or as Crooked Fingers, has long been obsessed with a grim Southern Gothic country-folk that has none of the sparkle of his former rock band, Archers of Loaf. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario)

* MODEST MOUSE (Monday through Wednesday) A band so emblematic of 21st-century indie rock that it was mentioned by name in the Supreme Court's decision on MGM v. Grokster last year, Modest Mouse links antsy, catchy guitar lines to vocals that are always just a few shrieks away from a destructive tantrum. These three shows begin a five-concert New York series that is likely to show off songs from the band's long-delayed new album. Monday at 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $31. Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario)

MARISA MONTE (Tuesday) One of Brazil's most sensual (and successful) singers, Ms. Monte took a break five years ago to have a child, and after a joint record with Carlinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes, has returned with two superb new solo albums: ''Universo ao Meu Redor,'' which won a Latin Grammy last week, is made up of traditional sambas, and ''Infinito Particular'' (both on Metro Blue/Blue Note) sets her own compositions to orchestral and electronic accompaniment. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; $49.50 to $78.50. (Sisario)

MOUSE ON MARS (Tomorrow) Since 1993, Andi Toma and Jan St. Werner, two German electronic musicians with a knack for surrealistic mischief, have been making some of the strangest and most compelling music on the planet out of slippery squiggles of sound that seem to dance around in space as if part of some wild sonic cartoon. At 8:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)

* JOANNA NEWSOM (Monday) The fairy queen of the freak-folk movement, Ms. Newsom uses a harp and her froggish little voice to spin elaborate, beguiling fantasies, always giving the sense that no matter how imaginative her music is, she is capable of much, much more. Her latest, ''Ys'' (Drag City), contains five dense orchestrated songs that are on average about 11 minutes long. With P. G. Six, also known as the guitarist Pat Gubler. At 5 and 9:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario)

OAKLEY HALL, MICAH P. HINSON (Tonight) Patient country-folk mutates into powerful, throbbing drones in the songs of Oakley Hall, a Brooklyn band led by Pat Sullivan, a former member of Brooklyn's other masters of psychedelic minimalism, Oneida. With a groaning, melancholic baritone and fractured guitar chords, Mr. Hinson, from Abilene, Tex., sings of regret, wasted lives and the sacrifice of ''rock 'n' roll's worst leading guy.'' At 7:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12. Mr. Hinson also plays tomorrow night at 7:30 at Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $8. (Sisario)

PLASTIC PEOPLE OF THE UNIVERSE (Monday) In Prague in the 1960s, the Plastic People of the Universe transmuted the lessons of Frank Zappa and the Velvet Underground into dank, dissonant, precise songs that drew the wrath of Czechoslovakia's Communist government. But the reconstituted band's songs are more than period pieces; by finding a rock language for Eastern European angst, they turn desperation inside out. The guitarist Gary Lucas opens the show with his band Gods and Monsters. At 7 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Pareles)

PLUS-44 (Tuesday) It's not often that the rivaling former members of a multiplatinum band pass through the same club, giving curious fans a controlled experiment to judge who has made out better. Last year the boys-will-be-boys pop-punk band Blink-182 went on acrimonious hiatus, and one of its two singers, Tom DeLonge, started a new group, Angels and Airwaves; it played the Bowery Ballroom in May. Now come the two other alumni, Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker, with their own band, Plus-44. Both groups are darker and more emo-influenced than Blink-182, and unfortunately for fans scrambling for a way into this show, neither has much of the fire of their former band. At 8 p.m., with the Matches, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)

ROBERT POLLARD (Monday) One of the most prolific and gifted songwriters in alternative rock -- or any kind of rock -- Mr. Pollard, now 49, dissolved his long-running band Guided by Voices two years ago but has persisted with the style and work ethic of that band, releasing a small stack of solo albums and EP's whose songs vary from indulgent lo-fi sketches to clean, crisp glories of guitar-rock that conjure the best of the Who and Big Star. At 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $23 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)

* SCRITTI POLITTI (Tonight) Green Gartside, the 51-year-old Welsh singer and songwriter who is the core of Scritti Politti, works slowly and deliberately. A bright light in the confrontationally arty post-punk scene in the late 70s, he turned in the 80s to sweet and almost classically elegant pop; Miles Davis performed one of his songs in admiration. His latest album, ''White Bread Black Beer'' (Nonesuch), is one of his strongest in years, and his band is only now on its first American tour. At 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $20. (Sisario)

TWILIGHT SINGERS (Thursday) Greg Dulli led the Afghan Whigs before he started the more introspective Twilight Singers, who help him wallow in loneliness and romantic insecurity as he confesses all in his smoky voice. At 8:30 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $22. (Pareles)

WITCHCRAFT (Tonight) No, that's not Black Sabbath playing some long-lost track from 1971. It's Witchcraft, a Swedish band that even in a deeply retro metal culture stands out for a remarkable simulacrum of its heroes' knuckle-dragging fuzz-blues, even down to Magnus Pelander's helium-voiced Ozzy Osbourne. If Black Sabbath made it look easy, Witchcraft makes it look even easier. With Danava. At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $12. (Sisario)

Jazz

* MUHAL RICHARD ABRAMS (Tonight) Mr. Abrams, the pianist and composer, is an architect of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, or A.A.C.M. He performs tonight in a solo piano setting, in duets with the vibraphonist Bryan Carrott and in a quintet whose other members are Aaron Stewart and Howard Johnson on reeds, Saadi Zain on bass and Tyshawn Sorey on drums. At 8, Community Church of New York, 40 East 35th Street, Manhattan, aacm-newyork.com; $25. (Nate Chinen)

PETER APFELBAUM AND NEW YORK HIEROGLYPHICS (Thursday) Peter Apfelbaum, a saxophonist and pianist, formed his African-inspired Hieroglyphics Ensemble more than 20 years ago in the Bay Area. His 11-piece East Coast edition of the group includes Peck Allmond on trumpet, tenor saxophone and flute; Charlie Burnham on violin; and Abdoulaye Diabate on vocals. (Through Nov. 17.) At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; members, $10. (Chinen)

MARC CARY AND ABSTRAKT BLAK (Tonight) The keyboardist Marc Cary and the producer Shon (Chance) Miller make up Abstrakt Blak, an experimental electronic project inspired by sources from Langston Hughes to go-go funk. At midnight, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $10, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

BILL CHARLAP TRIO (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Bright and breezy yet unfailingly precise, the pianist Bill Charlap keeps a standard repertory percolating in the present tense. (Through Nov. 19.) At 9 and 11, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

THE COOKERS (Wednesday and Thursday) A dream team of powerhouse post-bop, with the trumpeters Charles Tolliver and David Weiss, the saxophonists Billy Harper and James Spaulding, and the pianist George Cables. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25. (Chinen)

CHICK COREA (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) This weekend Mr. Corea leads his Elektric Band, with Eric Marienthal on alto saxophone, Frank Gambale on guitar, Victor Wooten on bass and Dave Weckl on drums.

STEVE DAVIS QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Update'' (Criss Cross), the new album by the trombonist Steve Davis, earns its title by gently bringing 1950s hard bop into a modern sphere. Mr. Davis enacts a similar process with his quintet, which features the saxophonist Mike DiRubbo. At 7:30 and 9:15, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

* ANDREW HILL OCTET (Tuesday) Three years ago Blue Note Records issued ''Passing Ships,'' recorded by the pianist Andrew Hill in 1969. It was a revelation: Mr. Hill's compositions suggest a lyrically focused approach to avant-garde exploration. The album receives an unprecedented concert interpretation by Mr. Hill, 69, with an ensemble that includes the trumpeter Keyon Harrold and the trombonist Curtis Fowlkes; of note is the participation of Howard Johnson, who played tuba and bass clarinet on the album. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $30 in advance, $35 on Tuesday. (Chinen)

MIKE HOLOBER AND THE GOTHAM JAZZ ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) Mike Holober is a pianist, composer and arranger for the Gotham Jazz Orchestra, a big band stocked with the trumpeters Tony Kadleck and Joe Magnarelli, the trombonist Bruce Eidem and the drummer John Riley. Their lone album, ''Thought Trains'' (Sons of Sound), was released in 2004 but recorded back in 1996, and it's a safe bet that the band's sound has evolved since then. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20. (Chinen)

BOBBY HUTCHERSON QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) Bobby Hutcherson has been the chief proponent of a harmonically restless post-bop vibraphone style for roughly 40 years. Still a searcher and a dynamo, he leads a propulsive rhythm section composed of Renee Rosnes on piano, Dwayne Burno on bass and Al Foster on drums. (Through Nov. 19.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)

At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; members, $10. (Chinen)

BRIAN LYNCH/EDDIE PALMIERI PROJECT (Thursday) The trumpeter Brian Lynch has a new album, ''Simpatico'' (ArtistShare), that highlights his longstanding affiliation with the pianist Eddie Palmieri. To celebrate the album's release, Mr. Lynch leads a group featuring Conrad Herwig on trombone, Yosvany Terry on alto saxophone and Dafnis Prieto on drums, among others; filling in for Mr. Palmieri is a smart up-and-comer, Manuel Valera. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

RUSSELL MALONE QUARTET (Tonight through Sunday) Russell Malone's new album, ''Live at Jazz Standard Volume One'' (MaxJazz), affirms his stature as one of the finest guitarists in the modern jazz mainstream. He returns to the club with the working band of Martin Bejerano on piano, Tassili Bond on bass and Johnathan Blake on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $30; $25 on Sunday. (Chinen)

MARCIN MASECKI (Tomorrow) Mr. Masecki, a pianist based in Warsaw, performs a solo set presented in part by the Polish Cultural Institute. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)

CHARLES MCPHERSON QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Charlie Parker serves as a clear model for the alto saxophonist Charles McPherson, one of bebop's premier torchbearers. His well-pressed band includes his son, Chuck McPherson, on drums; Jeb Patton on piano; and Ray Drummond on bass. At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $30. (Chinen)

BEN MONDER TRIO (Tomorrow) A sleekly proficient guitarist and deeply imaginative composer, Ben Monder focuses his ideas best in this nimble trio with the bassist Chris Lightcap and the drummer Ted Poor. At midnight, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $10, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

LUIS PERDOMO TRIO (Tomorrow) ''Awareness'' (RKM) is the second release by the pianist Luis Perdomo, and it marks a significant advance: he plays with exploratory urgency, and his compositions take unforced yet unexpected turns. Here he reunites with the album's primary bassist, Hans Glawischnig, and one of its two drummers, Nasheet Waits. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; members, $10. (Chinen)

* DJANGO REINHARDT NY FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) What began as a salute to the gypsy guitarist has evolved into a smorgasbord of buoyant swing. This season's stars include the guitarists Dorado Schmitt, Samson Schmitt and Tchavolo Schmitt -- gypsy swing tends to be a family affair -- along with the accordionist Ludovic Beier. Among other guests: the clarinetist Ken Peplowski (tonight), the pianist Ray Kennedy (tomorrow) and the harpist Edmar Castaneda (Sunday). At 8 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

* MATTHEW SHIPP (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Shipp's pianism is often prickly but rarely off-putting, because his even his free improvisations tend to follow a faintly linear path. Drawing from a new body of compositions called ''Sacred Geometry,'' he performs a solo set as well as a performance with the bassist Michael Bisio and the cellist Okkyung Lee. At 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, thekitchen.org; $10. (Chinen)

TYSHAWN SOREY'S OBLIQUE (Sunday) Tyshawn Sorey is often an explosive drummer, but he brings subtlety to this band, which includes the trombonist Ben Gerstein and the alto saxophonist Loren Stillman.

VISION CLUB SERIES (Tomorrow) This off-season outreach of the Vision Festival presents two free-jazz ensembles: a trio consisting of the alto saxophonist Rob Brown, the cellist Daniel Levin and the drummer Satoshi Takeishi (at 7:30 p.m.); and Test, featuring the multi-reedists Daniel Carter and Sabir Mateen, with the drummer Tom Bruno (at 9 p.m.). Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681, visionfestival.org; cover, $10 a set; students, $7. (Chinen)

YELLOWJACKETS (Tuesday through Thursday) After 25 years, this pace car of light-fusion bands has not slowed, thanks to the stewardship of two of its founding members -- the keyboardist Russell Ferrante and the bassist Jimmy Haslip -- and the strong contribution of Bob Mintzer on saxophones and Marcus Baylor on drums. (Through Nov. 18.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

 Opera

* 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tonight, Monday and Thursday) There is tremendous buzz around this ''Barber,'' partly because it will be staged by Bartlett Sher (''The Light in the Piazza''), partly because it features Juan Diego Florez, today's hottest (in more than one sense) Rossini tenor. And it will probably be good, because you have to work hard to mess up ''Barber.'' Diana Damrau, a much-praised soprano, is the Rosina; Peter Mattei is Figaro; and Maurizio Benini conducts. Tonight at 8, Monday and Thursday nights at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $100 to $550 tickets remaining tonight, $175 to $375 for Monday, and $80 to $320 for Thursday. (Anne Midgette)

'CARMEN' (Tomorrow) A new cast has taken over for the remainder of the run. In her first season at New York City Opera, Vanessa Cariddi plays the Gypsy; Kerri Marcinko and Daesan No, two other newcomers, are Micaela and Escamillo. Scott Piper, who has a promising voice, is Don Jose, and Gary Thor Wedow conducts. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; sold out. (Midgette)

'COSI FAN TUTTE' (Wednesday) City Opera's intelligent, well-sung production of Mozart's masterpiece reappears. Julianna Di Giacomo and James Maddalena are still highlights of the cast, with Julius Rudel conducting. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Bernard Holland)

'The Elixir of Love' (Tonight, Tuesday and Thursday) Jonathan Miller has created an all-American version of Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore,'' transposing the action to a vintage roadside diner to create something that is dramatically consistent but also dramatically slight. Yet ''Elisir'' is a delightful opera, and that prevails whatever you think of the director's conceit (using the word advisedly). The second cast of the run includes the American tenor Leonardo Capalbo, making his company debut as Nemorino, and Georgia Jarman, a fine soprano, as his Adina. Gerald Steichen conducts. Tonight at 8, Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Midgette)

'HANSEL AND GRETEL' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Opera is big and loud, ''children's theater'' is light and fun, and Engelbert Humperdinck's classic represents an uneasy juxtaposition of the two. By setting the action in 1890s New York, City Opera moves the story into a more adult or believable realm, with Hansel and Gretel as immigrant children lapsing into German ditties in a singing English translation, but without losing some of the important elements, like the witch going into the oven at the end. The singers trade off between performances; Jennifer Aylmer and Jennifer Rivera are one pair of leads who do a fine job. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Sunday at 1:30 and 5:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $115. (Midgette)

* 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The abstract staging of this visually beautiful production by the Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella deftly employs movable screens, billowing fabrics, stylized costumes and, most daringly, a life-sized puppet manipulated by three black-clad puppeteers to portray Butterfly's 3-year-old son. Vocally, neither of the leads, the earthy-voiced soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domas as Butterfly, and the robustly Italianate tenor Marcello Giordani as Pinkerton, is ideal. But they do honorable work. Asher Fisch conducts tomorrow, and James Levine conducts on Wednesday. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)

* 'ORPHEE AUX ENFERS' (Wednesday) This Offenbach sendup of the Orfeo and Euridice story (and specifically of Gluck's operatic version of the tale) is one of this composer's cleverest operettas. The Juilliard Opera Center is presenting an ambitious production of this work, directed by John Pascoe (who also designed the sets and costumes) and conducted by the admirable Anne Manson. The later, stronger 1874 version will be presented. At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; $20. (Tommasini)

* TEATRO GRATTACIELO (Tomorrow) With its boundless enthusiasm for Italian opera from the verismo school, which flourished in the early 20th century, Teatro Grattacielo has been drawing loyal audiences to its performances of some very obscure works. Tomorrow is the North American premiere of a Zandonai opera, ''La Farsa Amorosa.'' David Wroe conducts a full orchestra, chorus and cast. At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $25 to $75. (Tommasini)

'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Andrea Gruber is a soprano who flings herself into roles; accordingly, she takes on her first Tosca with a certain violence. The character becomes tough yet vulnerable in her reading, yet the vulnerability is perhaps too pronounced in her uneven, patchy singing. Jose Cura is a bad-boy Cavaradossi who proves, when he sings out, also to be vocally uneven; he sings tomorrow, but Vincenzo La Scola will sing the role on Tuesday. James Morris is a known and growly quantity as Scarpia. The real news is the company debut of the conductor Nicola Luisotti, who conducts the piece as if it mattered. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 to $375 tickets remaining for tomorrow, $15 to $375 on Tuesday. (Midgette)

Classical Music

* AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Thursday) The composer Derek Bermel has won acclaim for pulsating works that vividly draw from classical, jazz and rock idioms. He has begun a three-year stint as composer in residence with this orchestra, which is collaborating for the first time with Jazz at Lincoln Center to present the premiere of his new work, ''The Migration Series.'' The program includes music by Gershwin, Mingus and John Lewis. Steven Sloane conducts. At 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; sold out. (Tommasini)

SERGIO AND ODAIR ASSAD (Tonight) This superb fraternal guitar duo move easily between the classical repertory and Latin pop, and this concert -- although it includes works by Ginastera, Copland (an arrangement of ''Hoe Down'' from ''Rodeo'') and Agustin Barrios -- edges more than usually toward the pop side. Paquito D'Rivera plays clarinet with the group in a program that includes music of his own, as well as pieces by Egberto Gismonti, Astor Piazzolla, Angel Villoldo, Rey Guerra, Eliseo Grenet and Pixinguinha. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $48. (Allan Kozinn)

KRISTIAN BEZUIDENHOUT (Tuesday) This South African harpsichordist and fortepiano player performs a program called ''J. S. Bach Sturm and Drang,'' with Le Nuove Musiche, a period-instrument ensemble. The concert includes the Ciaconna from Bach's Partita in D minor; Benda's Sonata in A minor; Hertel's Piano Concerto in F minor; and Mozart's Rondo in A minor (K. 511) and Piano Concerto in A (K. 414). At 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35; $21 for students. (Vivien Schweitzer)

JONATHAN BISS AND BENJAMIN HOCHMAN (Wednesday) These talented pianists perform Mozart's Sonata in F for Piano Four Hands; Schubert's Fantasy in F minor for Piano Four Hands; and Schumann/Debussy: Six Pieces in Canonic Form for Two Pianos. They will be joined by James Deitz and Ayano Kataoka for Bartok's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40. (Schweitzer)

BORROMEO STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) The Peoples' Symphony Concerts organization has been offering a chance to hear first-rate artists at a wallet-friendly price since the conductor Franz X. Arens founded it in 1900. Tomorrow the Borromeo will play Osvaldo Golijov's ''Tenebrae,'' Shostakovich's Quartet No. 3 and Brahms's Clarinet Quintet, with Richard Stoltzman. At 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, 16th Street and Irving Place, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org; $9. (Schweitzer)

* BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) With the Boston Symphony, the music director James Levine is in the midst of a programming adventure in which works by two revolutionaries, Beethoven and Schoenberg, are paired. For this concert at Carnegie Hall, though, he pairs works by two other path-breakers: Brahms's Symphony No. 1 and Bartok's gripping one-act opera ''Bluebeard's Castle.'' Albert Dohmen sings the role of the fearsome, secretive Duke Bluebeard, and Anne Sofie von Otter is Judith, his tragically innocent new wife. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $39 to $127. (Tommasini)

BRENTANO STRING QUARTET AND MITSUKO UCHIDA (Tomorrow) Prime musicians play a prime program that includes Mozart's Piano Quartet in G minor, the Bartok Second String Quartet and the Schumann Piano Quintet. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $50 and $68, with limited availability. (Holland)

'ECCE COR MEUM' (Tuesday) Few composers of any stripe can touch Paul McCartney's melodies, and this choral work -- his third large-scale score -- has some lovely touches. It is also about as conservative as can be, and would have been fully at home a century ago. Recently issued on CD, it has its New York premiere with Kate Royal as the soprano soloist with the Concert Chorale of New York, the American Boychoir and the Orchestra of St. Luke's, conducted by Gavin Greenaway. At 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $35 to $125. (Kozinn)

ENSEMBLE EUROPEEN WILLIAM BYRD (Sunday) This Paris-based vocal quintet, directed by Graham O'Reilly, makes its New York debut with a program of motets by Charpentier, Du Mont, Moulinie and Brossard. At 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266, mb1800.org; $25 and $40; $20 and $35 for students and 62+. (Kozinn)

JUiLLIARD ORCHESTRA (Monday) This first-rate young orchestra, conducted by George Manahan, will play Stravinsky's ''Chant du Rossignol,'' Ravel's orchestration of Mussorgsky's ''Pictures at an Exhibition'' and Prokofiev's Sinfonia Concertante (Op. 125), with Anna Burden, a 22-year-old American cellist. At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required. (Schweitzer)

JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET (Tonight) Now an American chamber music institution, this ensemble celebrates its 60th anniversary with a traversal of the Bartok string quartet cycle, the group's signature repertory since its earliest days. The first installment was on Wednesday, and it concludes the set tonight with Nos. 2, 4 and 6. At 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn)

GIDON KREMER, ANDREI PUSHKAREV AND ANDRIUS ZLABYS (Sunday) The 60-minute Movado Hour series, inaugurated last fall after the completion of the Baryshnikov Arts Center, continues with a concert by Mr. Kremer, a violinist; Mr. Pushkarev, a percussionist; and Mr. Zlabys, a pianist. They will play works by Bach, Busoni, Tickmayer and Piazzolla. At 6 p.m., 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212) 218-7540, baryshnikovdancefoundation.org; free, but reservations are required. (Schweitzer)

MARYINSKY ACADEMY OF YOUNG SINGERS (Tonight through Sunday night) Shostakovich, the ''other'' birthday boy, would have been 100 this year, and some of the most interesting musical tributes have been to him. This weekend the Maryinsky offers a three-concert survey of his songs, presented by some recognized young singers from its training program. Daniil Shtoda, a tenor who made a bit of a splash a few years back, sings tonight, and the mezzo Ekaterina Semenchuk, who competed in the 2001 Cardiff Singer of the World, is on all three programs. The concerts are grouped roughly chronologically, with exceptions, from Opus 21 tonight (''Six Romances on Texts of Japanese Poets'') to Opus 145 on Sunday night (Five Songs from ''Michelangelo Suite''). At 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26. (Midgette)

MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO (Tonight) This concert features chamber music by performers linked to the summer school and festival in Vermont. Seven players mix and match to play Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok and Mozart. At 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $40. (Holland)

ANNE-SOPHIE MUTTER (Wednesday) This German violinist and her longstanding collaborator at the piano, Lambert Orkis, give one of their regular Carnegie Hall recitals. The anniversary year (you know whose) is coming to an end, but the celebration isn't slowing down. So once again it's all Mozart, with five violin and piano sonatas. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $98. (Holland)

NEW JUILLIARD ENSEMBLE (Thursday) Joel Sachs leads his young players in another foray into contemporary music.

At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required. (Holland)

'NEW SOUNDS LIVE' (Tonight) The composer Phil Kline's best-known works use boomboxes and other street-level devices, but his latest score, ''John the Revelator'' -- commissioned by WNYC and influenced by everything from the Bible to the blues -- will be given its premiere by Lionheart, the early-music vocal ensemble, and Ethel, the new-music string quartet. At 7, Winter Garden at the World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com; free. (Kozinn)

NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG (Wednesday and Thursday) Fans of this series don't go to a concert for a particular program but for what is always an entertaining evening of unfamiliar music, wittily elucidated by Steven Blier. ''Brava Italia'' is the theme of this week's (repeated) recital, with 20th-century Italian song, from Puccini and Mascagni onward, as its putative scope, and the definition of ''Italian'' stretched to include any composer with an Italian name: Dominick Argento, John Musto. Singers include Carolyn Betty, Sasha Cooke and Jeremy Little. At 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $45; $35 for 65+. (Midgette)

At 7:30 p.m., St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360, saintthomaschurch.org; $25 to $60. (Schweitzer)

LAWRENCE GOLDHUBER (Tonight through Sunday) O.K., O.K., we know this is billed as ''theater,'' that dull alternative art form.

 Museums

* Bronx Museum of the Arts, 'Tropicalia: A Revolution in Brazilian Culture,' through Jan. 28. Tropicalia, or Tropicalism, wasn't a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over Brazil in the late 1960s like a sunshower, and soaked into everything -- art, music, film, theater and architecture -- until a military government clamped down. This show is an attempt to recapture the moment's fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and musicians like Gilberto Gil, it comes close. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)

Brooklyn Museum: 'ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: A PHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE, 1990-2005,' through Jan. 21. With photographs of her close-knit family and her companion, Susan Sontag; bits of photojournalism; and a pretentious foray into landscape photography, this large exhibition tells you more about Ms. Leibovitz than you probably want to know. The first-person text labels don't help. Not surprisingly, her well-known celebrity portraits are strongest, and at their best in a re-creation of the large pin-up boards on which she plotted the lavish book that accompanies the show. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Roberta Smith)

* Frick Collection: 'Domenico Tiepolo (1727-1804): A New Testament,' through Jan. 7. The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattist, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal peity. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious, but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary's mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses, who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)

* SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK,' through Jan. 21. If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, evoked his personal experience of the lagoon city in glowing colors during the passage of a day. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the wired energy and architectural vivacity he saw as the essence of the futuristic metropolis. The two groups are united for the first time, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Grace Glueck)

Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Americans in Paris: 1860-1900,' through Jan. 28. The Americanization of the world may be a done deal now, but not so long ago the United States was a buyer rather than a seller of cultural information, and France was a major source between the Civil War and World War I. That's the story told in this exhibition. The basic ideas, though undeveloped, are inherently interesting, and the art, with some notable exceptions, is conservative and staid, especially when compared with work in the Met's Vollard show, done at the same time. (212) 535-7719, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)

The Met: 'Coaxing the Spirits to Dance,' through Sept. 3, 2007. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck)

MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'FRAGONARD AND THE FRENCH TRADITION' AND 'MOZART AT 250: A CELEBRATION,' through Jan. 7. Memorializing Mozart's 250th birthday and the 200th anniversary of the death of the French painter Jean-Honore Fragonard, these small, paired shows reflect the elegance and brio of 18th-century culture. The Fragonard display consists only of his drawings and those of some compatriots, among them Francois Boucher, Hubert Robert and Jean-Baptiste Greuze; 40 works in all, drawn almost entirely from the Morgan's collection. The show effectively displays the virtuosity and variety of Fragonard's many styles, from his skills at depicting foliage-filled landscapes and the play of water in fountains and streams, to his keenness at capturing people, mythological scenes and ephemeral creatures. Although the works in the Mozart display -- letters and musical scores -- are in quite a different visual language, they go very happily with the Fragonard group. And you can hear excerpts from the manuscripts at two different listening stations in the show. 255 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Glueck)

* Museum of Modern Art: 'Manet and the Execution of Maximilian,' through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show remind us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here: eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded here by a riveting selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting, that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)

* Moma: 'BRICE MARDEN: A RETROSPECTIVE OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS,' through Jan. 15. This quietly magnificent 40-year retrospective pays tribute to an artist who helped rebuild painting in the 1970s, working back from the brink of single-panel monochromes to elegant tangles of thick line on vibrant monochrome grounds that encompass a tremendous emotional range and sense of physical energy, and give the lie to the idea that any art can be purely formal or completely abstract. Mr. Marden converted the rule-ridden zone of Minimalist abstraction into a capacious yet disciplined place, pushing it toward landscape, the figure and its roots in Abstract Expressionism and beyond, in non-Western art. And he may have saved the best for last. (See above.) (Smith)

NEWARK MUSEUM, the Jewish Museum: 'Masters of American Comics,' through Jan. 28. Organized by the Hammer Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where it made a splash, this show has come east, cut in size and split between the far-flung Newark and Jewish museums, in which it looks cramped. Art Spiegelman, one of the masters who helped instigate the exhibition, felt so aggrieved by the circumstances that at nearly the 11th hour he pulled his work. Still, the show shouldn't be missed. It spotlights artists like Chris Ware and Gary Panter, amazing state-of-the-art talents and endearing in the tradition of all those shy, gifted kids who drew endlessly in their rooms when other kids wouldn't play with them, dreaming about someday telling the world, ''I told you so.'' Newark Museum, 49 Washington Street, (973) 596-6550, newarkmuseum.org; and the Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Michael Kimmelman)

P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Katrin Sigurdardottir: High Plane,' through May 7. Cut into a space between two levels of P.S. 1 is the Icelandic artist Katrin Sigurdardottir's ''High Plane V,'' a miniature artificial landscape of glacial mountains arranged in a naturalistic, faux-snow-covered setting against a painted white background. Visitors climb ladders and peer into one of two holes in the ceiling to view the work. The installation works best when two people mount the ladders and poke their heads in at the same time: then they can both see a disembodied head floating in the middle of the icy landscape. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Benjamin Genocchio)

* UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,' through March 11. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art -- Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter -- were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists , including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. The entirely nonobjective Suprematist work of Kasimir Malevich, for instance, was based in part on Ukrainian folk motifs, and the exuberant Cubist-Futurist theater designs and paintings by Alexandra Exter relate to icons and patterns from village embroideries and weavings and bright peasant costumes. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. Stressing as it does the importance of Ukrainian participation in Modernist art, the show is equally significant in its exposure to Americans of lively talents, largely unknown. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck).

* The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD,' through Jan. 21. This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the ''specific objects'' of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. The less-known Moholy-Nagy looks especially adventuresome. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)

The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Picasso and american art,' through Jan. 28. Despite the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. Next slide, please. The show ends with a virtual retrospective of Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velazquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him. See above. (Kimmelman)

Galleries

Anant Joshi Cities in Asia are changing fast. They're going up and coming down at about equal speed. Urban culture, flooded with global goods and media, is changing too. Inevitably, such transformations have a big impact on art, and they are the subjects of new work by Anant Joshi, who lives and works in Mumbai. Paintings show a vision of the city modeled on commercial packing materials. Small sculptures, monuments to consumerist chaos, are assembled from hundreds of miniature toys, all made in China. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 673-3096, talwargallery.com, through Nov. 18. (Cotter)

Last Chance

* NICK CAVE: SOUNDSUITS Whether the efforts of this Chicago designer/artist qualify as fashion, body art or sculpture, they fall squarely under the heading of Must Be Seen to Be Believed. Worn in performance and covering the artist from head to toe and beyond, they also suggest mysterious ritual costumes of possibly African origin or aliens from a galaxy of extravagantly fashion-conscious planets. Embroidery, beads and especially sequins join forces with Easter grass, found fabrics, old sweaters, twigs and dryer lint, to bedazzling effect. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 654-1701; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

Robert Colescott: 'A Survey of Paintings' It's good to have Robert Colescott back in town for his first New York solo show here since 2000. Now 81, Mr. Colescott has been dealing in a slap-in-the-face way with race, class, sex and American life for nearly 40 years. His early pictures, like ''George Washington Carver Crossing the Delaware'' (1975), were riffs on museum classics; the five paintings from the 1990s in this mini-survey are a lot harder to pin down. They're richly and expressively painted; they don't hinge on a joke or a clear-cut contrast between good and bad, though they tend to feel bad, in a bad-dream way, and sick-joke funny. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-2238, kravetswehbygallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)

* DICE THROWN (WILL NEVER ANNUL CHANCE) This admirably focused exhibition reveals the ways that 12 emerging and recently emerged artists push at the boundaries of photography -- mixing found, appropriated and made (or even drawn) images in ways that expand the medium's technical means and make it resonate in time, space and memory. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-5959; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Toilets Underused to Fight Disease, U.N. Study Finds

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
The toilet and the latrine, which helped revolutionize public health in New York, London and Paris more than a century ago, are among the most underused tools to combat poverty and disease in the developing world, says a United Nations report released yesterday.
 ''Issues dealing with human excrement tend not to figure prominently in the programs of political parties contesting elections or the agendas of governments,'' said Kevin Watkins, the main author of the report. ''They're the unwanted guests at the table.'' 
The human cost of that taboo, however, is more unspeakable than the topic itself, he said. Every year, more than two million children die of diarrhea and other sicknesses caused by dirty water and a lack of ''access to sanitation.'' 
 That is the common euphemism for the reality that more than a third of the world's people -- 2.6 billion -- have no decent place to go to the bathroom, while more than a billion get water for drinking, washing and cooking from sources polluted by human and animal feces. 
 At any time, almost half the people in developing countries have one or more of the main illnesses associated with inadequate water and sanitation and fill half the hospital beds, the report said. They are plagued by diarrhea, cholera, typhoid, trachoma and parasitic worms. 
 The United Nations Development Program's annual attempt to measure human well-being focuses this year on the dearth of clean water and adequate sanitation for the world's poor. The report, ''Beyond Poverty: Power, Poverty and the Global Water Crisis,'' lays out the grim facts.
 In Kibera, the sprawling slum in Nairobi, Kenya, people defecate in plastic bags that they dump in ditches or toss into the street -- a practice known as ''the flying toilet.'' In Dharavi, the vast slum in Mumbai, India, there is only one toilet per 1,440 people -- and during the monsoon rains, flooded lanes run with human excrement.
 Across the countryside in Asia and Africa, people are forced to squat in streams, backyards and fields, befouling the water they drink, the places where their children play and the plots where their food grows. 
 The report's authors estimate that it would cost $10 billion a year to halve the percentage of people without access to safe drinking water and to provide them with simple pit latrines. But that is less than half what rich countries spend annually on bottled water.
 The report blames the governments of poor and rich countries for paying too little attention to this fundamental problem. 
 ''Life-saving investments in water and sanitation are dwarfed by military spending,'' the report says. ''In Ethiopia, the military budget is 10 times the water and sanitation budget -- in Pakistan, 47 times.''
 The report also notes that since the mid-1990s, aid from wealthy nations for water and sanitation has declined in real terms, falling to 5 percent from 8 percent of overall development aid -- ''a marked contrast to education, where aid commitments doubled over the same period.'' Japan is by far the leader in aid for water and sanitation, providing $850 million in 2003 and 2004, a fifth of the total.
 Some of the most innovative efforts to expand the availability of latrines and simple sewage systems have occurred in South Asia, the report says. 
 In Karachi, Pakistan, a local group began organizing slum dwellers lane by lane in 1980 to build sewer channels to collect waste from their homes. Entire neighborhoods then collaborated to construct larger channels, and the city eventually agreed to finance a trunk sewer line. The infant mortality rate in the slum, Orangi, has fallen to 40 deaths per 1,000 births, from 130 in the early 1980s.
 In Bangladesh, more than 600 private groups work with communities to map the places where people defecate and the routes of disease transmission, helping to fuel demand for sanitation services. More than 3,000 small businesses have sprung up to produce, market and maintain cheap latrines.
 In India, a private group called Sulabh has built thousands of public toilets and more than a million private latrines that cost as little as $10 each in more than 1,000 cities nationwide. The local authorities pay to build the public toilets, but user fees cover the costs of running them. The fee is about 2 cents, with free access for children, the disabled and the destitute.

HEADLINE: China: Scapegoat Or Sputnik

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
As I was saying, Mr. Rove, Americans aren't as stupid as you think.
 Now that we've settled that, and now that we've had an election that clarified which country is most important in shaping U.S. politics in 2006 -- Iraq -- I've come to visit the country that's most likely to shape U.S. politics in 2008: China.
The civil war in the Republican Party, which you are about to see, will be all about Iraq -- whom to blame and how to withdraw before the issue wipes out more Republican candidates in 2008. But the coming civil war among the Democrats will be all about China. 
 I still believe that when the history of this era is written, the trend that historians will cite as the most significant will not be 9/11 and the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. It will be the rise of China and India. How the world accommodates itself to these rising powers, and how America manages the economic opportunities and challenges they pose, is still the most important global trend to watch. 
 It really hits you when you see the supersize buildings sprouting in Shanghai, or when you look at the world through non-American eyes. Kishore Mahbubani, the dean of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, told me the other day that Asia right now ''is the most optimistic place in the world.'' More people have come out of poverty faster there -- particularly in India and China -- than at any time in the history of the world, and as a result, he notes, more people in Asia than anywhere else in the world today ''wake up every morning sure that tomorrow is going to be better than yesterday.''
 But one person's optimism can be another person's flat wages. And that is why the Democrats and China are almost certain to butt heads. The Bush team's focus on Iraq and terrorism, coupled with the Democrats' lack of control over either house of Congress, has kept China-U.S. relations largely out of the headlines and on a relatively even keel during the Bush II years.
 But two things will change that. One is the Democrats' return to control of both the House and Senate -- powered by politicians like Nancy Pelosi, who has long taken a hard line vis-a-vis China on both economics and human rights, and Sherrod Brown, the newly elected senator from Ohio, who comes to D.C. with strong protectionist leanings from a state that has lost thousands of manufacturing jobs to Asia. 
 The other is the mood reflected in a Nov. 2 analysis in The Financial Times, headlined: ''Anxious Middle: Why Ordinary Americans Have Missed Out on the Benefits of Growth.''
 Technology and globalization are flattening the global economic playing field today, enabling many more developing nations to compete for white-collar and blue-collar jobs once reserved for the developed world. This is one reason why growth in wages for the average U.S. worker has not been keeping pace with our growth in productivity and G.D.P.
 ''Economists call this phenomenon median wage stagnation,'' noted The Financial Times. ''Median measures give the best picture of what is happening to the middle class because, unlike mean or average wages, median wages are not pulled upwards by rapid gains at the top. As the joke goes: Bill Gates walks into a bar and, on average, everyone there becomes a millionaire. But the median does not change.''
 Many Americans lately have started to get that joke, and it is one reason that with this new Democrat-led Congress we are likely to see a surge in protectionist legislation, more Wal-Mart bashing, a slowdown in free-trade expansion and increased calls for punitive actions if China doesn't reduce its trade surplus -- which surged to a record in October.
 China, in other words, is inevitably going to move back to the center of U.S. politics, because it crystallizes the economic challenges faced by U.S. workers in the 21st century. The big question for me is, how will President Bush and the Democratic Congress use China: as a scapegoat or a Sputnik? 
 Will they use it as an excuse to avoid doing the hard things, because it's all just China's fault, or as an excuse to rally the country -- as we did after the Soviets leapt ahead of us in the space race and launched Sputnik -- to make the kind of comprehensive changes in health care, portability of pensions, entitlements and lifelong learning to give America's middle class the best tools possible to thrive? A lot of history is going to turn on that answer, because if people don't feel they have the tools or skills to thrive in a world without walls, the pressure to put up walls, especially against China, will steadily mount.

HEADLINE: Opponents Try to Lock Up Bronx Before Wal-Mart Knocks

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Last year, opponents of Wal-Mart -- including neighborhood, labor and small-business groups -- helped persuade a real estate developer to drop one of the company's stores from a planned mall in Queens. In August, opponents again helped thwart plans for a Wal-Mart at the southern tip of Staten Island. 
 Now, the Bronx has emerged as the latest battleground over attempts by Wal-Mart to open its first store in New York City. Leaders of the anti-Wal-Mart campaign have been forming alliances with Bronx community groups and politicians as well as holding town hall meetings to plan their attack and energize their ranks.
At Our Lady of Refuge Roman Catholic Church in the Bedford Park section of the Bronx, where for decades parishioners have rallied to denounce neighborhood drug dealers, people gathered last summer to demonstrate against an enemy that deals in digital cameras, toasters, shower curtains and thousands of other products. 
 But for the most part, they are fighting a ghost: Wal-Mart has not officially announced any intentions to build in the Bronx, and no one is certain where, when and even if it will try to open a store in the borough.
 ''The effort here is to head them off at the pass,'' said Richard Lipsky, director of the Neighborhood Retail Alliance, an advocacy group representing more than 10,000 city supermarkets, bodegas, greengrocers and restaurants that helped lead the recent fights against Wal-Mart on Staten Island and in Rego Park, Queens.
 Just the possibility of Wal-Mart moving in has already galvanized opponents, who began meeting in the Bronx in June and who say they need to be well organized to take on the nation's biggest retailer.
 One of the challenges for Wal-Mart critics, though, has been maintaining a sense of urgency against a perceived threat is, for now, but a rumor. 
 ''What's harder in any of these situations is organizing folks around a theory,'' Mr. Lipsky said. ''What made it easier to organize in Staten Island is people knew the store was being planted over there.''
 Adding to the uncertainty, a local newspaper, The Bronx Press-Review, reported in September that Wal-Mart was planning to locate a store in one of the biggest commercial spaces in the borough, the Bay Plaza shopping center near Co-op City.
 But Wal-Mart remained vague about its plans. Philip H. Serghini, a senior public affairs manager for Wal-Mart Stores, said in a statement that Wal-Mart was reviewing potential sites throughout the city. Asked specifically about the Bay Plaza site, Mr. Serghini responded: ''Wal-Mart continues to consider its options in all five boroughs.''
 The coalition forming in the Bronx includes members of Local 1500 of the United Food and Commercial Workers union and community groups like the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition. The coalition's work is sometimes serious (lobbying members of the City Council from the Bronx) and sometimes not (performing for audiences as the Reverend Billy and the Stop Shopping Gospel Choir). 
 The coalition's members believe that Wal-Mart represents capitalism run amok, reaping billions of dollars in profits while snuffing out smaller family-owned businesses and offering workers low-wage nonunion jobs.
 ''The Bronx needs jobs,'' said Patrick Purcell, director of organizing for Local 1500 and coordinator of Wal-Mart Free NYC, which was formed in response to Wal-Mart's attempts to open a store in Rego Park. ''Just because the Bronx is trying to develop itself economically does not mean that it needs any job. It needs good jobs. It needs responsible employers.''
 Even as the Bronx undergoes an economic revitalization, it continues to struggle with high rates of poverty, unemployment and crime. Opponents of Wal-Mart have had a hard time convincing some in the Bronx that a borough with the state's highest unemployment rate and the nation's poorest Congressional district would be better off without a Wal-Mart. The average wage for full-time Wal-Mart workers in the state is $10.17 an hour, the company said. The minimum wage in the state is $6.75.
 In a Quinnipiac University poll taken in January, 64 percent of Bronx residents said they supported the opening of Wal-Mart stores in the city, and 27 percent opposed it. 
 The borough president, Adolfo Carrion Jr., has said that though he is not trying to woo Wal-Mart, he is not interested in turning it or any other company away, either. 
 ''Anyone who's interested in doing business in the Bronx I will listen to and hear their pitch,'' Mr. Carrion has said.
 Other elected officials, like City Councilman Joel Rivera, have also staked out a neutral stance. 
 ''I'm of the belief that we have to spur economic development, but at the same time it has to be responsible economic development,'' said Mr. Rivera. Wal-Mart officials would need to be willing to negotiate on wages, health care benefits and other labor issues before he could welcome the store, he said. 
 Other Bronx elected officials remain firmly opposed, citing Wal-Mart's labor practices and impact on small businesses.
 Activists are emboldened by two behind-the-scenes victories in the Bronx. Earlier this year, the developer turning the old Bronx Terminal Market into a shopping mall specifically agreed not to lease space to Wal-Mart. 
 And the request for proposals for the redevelopment of the giant Kingsbridge Armory, issued in September by the city's Economic Development Corporation, discourages suburban-style big-box stores.
 As the campaign against it continues in the Bronx, Wal-Mart has tried to build a higher profile in the borough, subtly and not so subtly.
 Last year, Wal-Mart paid for large ads in several Bronx newspapers. ''In the Bronx,'' the ad read, ''you can watch the Yankees beat Boston, spend the day at the Botanical Garden, visit the Bronx Zoo, and do just about anything. The only thing missing is every day low prices.'' 
 The company was also a sponsor of the Latin Grammy Awards, held at Madison Square Garden on Nov. 2, and the banners promoting the show that hung in the South Bronx featured Wal-Mart prominently.
 Wal-Mart officials say a new store would create about 300 jobs and generate about $5 million in tax revenue for the city. Last year, New York City residents spent about $128 million at Wal-Mart stores in New Jersey and Connecticut, and in Westchester County and on Long Island in New York, the company said. 
 ''We don't think a small group of special interests should be able to stifle consumer choice and force the residents of the borough -- 72 percent of whom want Wal-Mart in their neighborhood -- to shop somewhere else,'' Mr. Serghini of Wal-Mart said.

HEADLINE: When Buddy (Psychotic) Meets Buddy (Weakling)

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Christian Bale is an actor who tries harder. In ''Harsh Times,'' his immersion in the role of an unhinged war veteran running amok on the streets of South Central Los Angeles offers the latest evidence that he will go to any lengths to nail down a character. Yet Mr. Bales's spectacular technical performance of a toxic bad boy on the fast track to hell somehow lacks an inner core.
 That loathsome menace to society is Jim Davis, about whom we are told little beyond the facts that he was an Army ranger (whether in the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan or Iraq remains unspecified) and left the service suffering from post-traumatic stress. Jim is as intense a character as Patrick Bateman, Mr. Bale's yuppie serial killer in ''American Psycho,'' and Trevor Resnik, the cadaverous insomniac from ''The Machinist,'' for which the actor lost 60 pounds. 
Whether stocky or emaciated, Mr. Bale has the look of a man staring into the abyss: think of the young Oliver North crossed with the Anthony Perkins of ''Psycho.'' The deep-set eyes in his handsome face are weirdly close together and their expression strangely opaque, as though all he sees are dead people. 
 ''Harsh Times'' is the directorial debut of David Ayer, who wrote its screenplay a decade ago, before his script for ''Training Day,'' which tells a similar story about a weakling under a bad influence. Both films portray raw American machismo as a disease and the buddy-buddy bond of two guys who goad each other into bad behavior as a psychological suicide pact. It suggests that on the mean streets of Los Angeles, men, when asked to choose between spending time with their wives and girlfriends or getting in trouble with their pals, will always opt for trouble. 
 Jim is first seen awakening from a nightmare in the arms of his doting, all-forgiving Mexican sweetheart, Marta (Tammy Trull). But his hopes of bringing her to the United States and marrying her are shattered when his application to join the Los Angeles Police Department is rejected. He goes into an immediate tailspin, dragging his best friend, Mike Alvarez (Freddy Rodriguez) with him. 
 Mike is a downscale variation of Federico Diaz, Mr. Rodriguez's character in the HBO series ''Six Feet Under.'' Wearing a mustache and casting oily sidelong glances, he plays out the same internal battle between macho adolescent and devoted husband that tears at Federico. His shaky marriage to Sylvia (Eva Longoria), a lawyer he put through school while working as a telemarketer, is severely strained by his lengthening unemployment and his reluctance to look for work. As he follows Jim on his downward spiral, he deceives Sylvia by having Jim and other friends impersonate potential employers on his home answering machine. 
 Jim's despair over his rejection from the L.A.P.D. lifts when the Department of Homeland Security calls, and the movie suggests an ugly jockeying for manpower among local and federal agencies. Jim knows how to play the obsequious straight arrow when required, and he makes a good impression until he fails both his drug and polygraph tests. He is offered a job nonetheless, but it is in Colombia fighting the drug war and would prevent him from marrying Marta. Mike unexpectedly lucks out with a job interview with an old acquaintance.
 By then, however, ''Harsh Times'' has signaled that the possibility for redemption is long past. For much of the movie, the pair rides around the neighborhood getting wasted on beer and pot and muddling through assorted brawls, robberies and shootings. A visit to an ex-girlfriend of Jim's is interrupted by the arrival of her new boyfriend and his posse, and the pair end up with a gun. 
 When Jim insists they celebrate in a final spree to Mexico, Mike dutifully tears himself away from his disgusted wife, and off they go. Jim's psychosis kicks in during a party at Marta's shack, and he has the first of several breaks that the rudimentary cinematography portrays in garish, wobbly multiple exposures. 
 ''Harsh Times'' purports to reflect Mr. Ayer's background, but much of the flashy gangbanger argot he wields sounds forced and unconvincing. The film builds to a melodramatic finale that would like to make you weep, but by then it has worn out your patience. These losers are too repellent to waste time feeling sorry for. 
 ''Harsh Times'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence, profanity and sexual situations.

Harsh Times
Opens today nationwide.

Written and directed by David Ayer; director of photography, Steve Mason; edited by Conrad Buff; music by Graeme Revell; production designer, Devorah Herbert; produced by Mr. Ayer and Andrea Sperling; released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Running time: 119 minutes.

HEADLINE: Democratic Victory Raises Spirits of Those Favoring Citizenship for Illegal Aliens 

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Nov. 9 

 BODY:
Supporters of granting citizenship to some or all illegal immigrants say the Democratic takeover of Congress has galvanized their cause and could lead to sweeping changes in immigration law.
 Democrats will take over leadership of committees in the House and the Senate that could guide new immigration legislation, while President Bush and the presumptive House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, have cast changes to immigration laws as an opportunity to demonstrate bipartisan bonhomie.
''We have never had the table set for the possibility of action as we do now,'' Andrea LaRue, a Democratic political consultant, said in a conference call with reporters. 
 Some immigration experts, however, predict a more arduous debate. Although conservative Republicans have led the opposition to accommodating some illegal immigrants, a handful of the newly elected Democrats, including Claire A. McCaskill of Missouri and Jim Webb of Virginia in the Senate, campaigned promising a tough approach to illegal immigration. 
 Some Democratic incumbents who won re-election did the same.
 ''It is still a long way from a deal,'' said Roberto Suro of the Pew Hispanic Center, a Washington research group. ''The question is, can somebody illuminate a middle ground where people who come at this issue from all different directions can reach a settlement.''
 Supporters of more relaxed policies on illegal immigration count among the casualties of the Democratic victory at least 11 House members who had opposed giving illegal immigrants an opportunity to gain legal residency and, ultimately, citizenship. 
 Representative J. D. Hayworth published a book on immigration titled ''Whatever It Takes'' and campaigned heavily on a platform of sealing the border and ejecting illegal immigrants. 
 Although Mr. Hayworth, a six-term Republican from the suburbs of Phoenix, has not conceded defeat, unofficial tallies indicate that he has lost his seat by four percentage points to a Democrat, Harry Mitchell.
 Mr. Mitchell, who is a former mayor of Tempe, had said that a path to citizenship made sense in some cases.
 Also in Arizona, a self-described Minuteman border vigilante, Randy Graf, a Republican seeking an open seat near the border, was soundly defeated by Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat willing to consider citizenship for some illegal immigrants.
 The Republican-controlled Congress failed to pass a broad immigration bill this session, stuck over whether to provide steps toward citizenship for illegal immigrants, although a measure calling for 700 miles of fencing on the 2,000-mile border was approved, with the backing of several Democrats, and signed by Mr. Bush.
 Many political analysts, however, called the fence an election-eve effort to placate conservatives that stood little chance of being completely built.
 Still, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington group favoring tighter limits on immigration, said six state ballot initiatives making life harder on illegal immigrants were approved by voters on Tuesday, four of them in Arizona, where immigration is intensely discussed, and two in Colorado.
 The Arizona measures include blocking illegal immigrants from collecting punitive damages in civil lawsuits, being released on bail for serious felonies and taking state-subsidized adult education and child care programs. 
 In Colorado, the measures require the state attorney general to sue the federal government for failing to enforce immigration laws and deny tax credits to employers who knowingly hire illegal workers.
 Bruce Merrill, an Arizona State University pollster, said the measures were popular because voters believed the federal government was not taking action.
 ''My feeling is that the frustration with nothing being done was so strong that if there had been 10 initiatives dealing with cracking down on illegal immigration, all 10 of them would have passed,'' Mr. Merrill said. 
 ''In other words,'' he said, ''what the initiatives were proposing substantively may not have been as important as giving people something, anything, they could vote for to feel something was being done.''
 Advocates of a get-tough approach said that despite their losses they had gained in the battle of ideas.
 ''When the incumbent Democrat runs a race on securing the border and cutting taxes, our ideas are doing just fine, let's remember that,'' said Len Munsil, the Republican candidate for governor who was soundly defeated by the incumbent, Janet Napolitano, a Democrat. 
 The governor had declared an emergency on the border last year and called for National Guard troops to go there.
 Senator Jon Kyl, a two-term Republican who supports a temporary guest worker program but not provisions that would lead to citizenship for illegal workers already here, won re-election by a healthy margin. 
 The final days of the race, however, focused less on immigration than on the backgrounds of the contenders. 
 Still, immigration advocates said the Democratic gains had brought new energy to a cause that seemed to flag after a round of demonstrations in the spring were followed by disappointing results in legislation and voter registration drives that fell short of goals.
 The election ''shows what we have been saying all along, that the anti-immigrant, enforcement-only rhetoric to motivate conservative voters was not reflecting where the majority of Americans are on this issue,'' said Angela Sembrano, director of the Central American Resource Center in Los Angeles, one of the groups that helped organize large pro-immigrant marches in the spring.
 Ms. Sembrano and other protest leaders said that, in the afterglow of election night, they would refrain from detailing what they will ask of Democrats until they meet with the new leadership in the coming weeks. But Chung-Wha Hong, executive director the New York Immigration Coalition, said the goal would still be ''legalization for as many people as possible.''
 People on all sides of the immigration debate had watched Arizona closely because illegal immigration has surged dramatically here in the past decade while its politics drifted toward the center from the right. 
 Earl de Berge, a veteran pollster here, said Republicans who made a hard-line approach the centerpiece of their campaigns misjudged a moderating shift.
 ''The fact is immigration was not, never has been, and is not the No. 1 issue in this state,'' Mr. De Berge said. ''The big issues were the same as the ones nationally, the war, the economy and Bush and so on.''
 ''The mistake Graf and Hayworth made,'' he said, ''is that they simply were outmaneuvered by their own insistence on beating on that one issue.''
 ''This,'' he added, ''is a moderate state, not a conservative Republican state.''

HEADLINE: An Army of One Less

BYLINE: By Paul D. Eaton. 
Paul D. Eaton, a retired Army major general, was in charge of training the Iraqi military from 2003 to 2004.

DATELINE: Fox Island, Wash. 

 BODY:
DURING the Watergate scandal, as I remember it, Garry Trudeau published a ''Doonesbury'' strip in which an embattled President Richard Nixon asks his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, ''Well, the Army's still with us right?'' 
 Haldeman replies, ''Sir, I'll go check.'' 
Perhaps President Bush and Donald Rumsfeld had a similar discussion after the midterm election results came in, and Mr. Rumsfeld's resignation as secretary of defense indicates what the answer was. 
 So, what will the new Democratic-controlled House and Senate and the new Pentagon, apparently to be led by Robert Gates, have to accomplish over the next two years to bring the Army -- and the other services -- back ''with'' us? I have a few suggestions. 
 First, on Iraq, the Democratic leadership needs to push the administration to move immediately on whatever recommendations come from the Iraq Study Group led by James Baker and Lee Hamilton. The decision to hold the commission's report until after the election was political idiocy -- every day we wait risks the lives of our soldiers and our Iraqi allies.
 At the same time, we need a Manhattan Project-level effort to build the Iraqi security forces. A good blueprint can be found in an article in the July-August Military Review by Lt. Col. Douglas Ollivant, a former operations officer with the Army's Fifth Cavalry Regiment in Iraq, and Lt. Eric D. Chewning. The plan is to create new multifaceted battalions -- blending infantry, armor, engineers and other specialists -- that would live and work beside Iraqi security forces and civilians. Some of our troops, working largely at the platoon level, have had great success along these lines; but as the authors note, such small units ''lack the robust staff and sufficient mass to fully exploit local relationships.'' It's time to replicate that success on a larger scale. 
 Democrats in Congress must also demand that the administration abide by the old adage, ''Keep your friends close and your enemies closer,'' in the Middle East. We should return our ambassador to Syria and re-establish diplomatic relations with Iran as first steps in building a coalition of Iraq's neighbors to plan the way forward. While their motives may not be identical to ours, they have little desire to see Iraq dissolve into civil war. 
 It is also vital to reinvigorate the military leadership. First, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Peter Pace, must begin to act in the role prescribed by the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986. This requires the senior man in uniform to have direct access to the president, a role denied to him and his predecessor, Gen. Richard Myers, by Mr. Rumsfeld. 
 As for the next secretary of defense, he must stand up to his own party. Congressional Republicans have told the Army that 512,000 troops are enough, and that the Pentagon should pay for them with the money already allocated, a zero sum game. This would mean raiding the funds that are supposed to go toward the first real Army modernization program since the Reagan years. (Today, military spending is 4 percent of gross domestic product, as opposed to 6.2 percent during the hugely successful Reagan build-up and more than 9 percent during the Vietnam War.) 
 The Army must rise to at least 570,000 troops to meet the demands placed on it. Before he was forced out as Army chief of staff in 2003, Gen. Eric Shinseki warned us to ''beware the 12-division foreign policy with a 10-division Army.'' That was a spot-on prediction of the problem we face today. 
 One thing everyone in Washington should agree on is that we must not allow Iraq to become a failed state. With Mr. Gates, look for a fresh start and fresh plan -- with both parties, and the entire cabinet and the military working through a robust interagency process -- to ensure it doesn't happen.

HEADLINE: Russia May be Close to Joining W.T.O.

BYLINE: COMPILED BY MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers on Friday.
 TOP STORIES
KOMMERSANT
 RUSSIA'S W.T.O. HOPES AND HURDLES: Presidents Bush and Vladimir V. Putin may announce the completion of bilateral talks on Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization when the two leaders meet in Hanoi on Nov. 18, according to American and Russian government sources. The new Democrat-controlled American Congress, which experts believe is less open to Russia's entry into the W.T.O., would then have to approve the agreement. Russia must also sign agreements with Costa Rica, Moldova and Georgia. Officials in Tbilisi have promised to block Russia's entry into the trade organization. 
 NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
 ''SCANDALOUS'' ELECTION AMENDMENTS PASSED: State Duma deputies approved dozens of amendments to Russia's election law on Thursday, including a controversial plan to eliminate a rule on minimum voter turnout, practically without discussion. During the 25-minute hearing, the turnout rule was not even mentioned. According to one Russian analyst, if the country's laws on political parties were not so repressive and if the state did not meddle in the electoral process, the new amendments would have a less negative impact. 
 WOMEN LEADERS GET A SMALL BOOST: The Novgorod regional administration has allocated about $5,500 to a local women's organization in the hopes of increasing the role of women in regional politics. The director of the Novgorod Women's Parliament complained that the sum would cover the group's rent for only a year. After 10 years of activism, however, the organization has made some gains. In last October's elections, three women won seats in the 25-person regional Pparliament.
 GAZETA
 THE DANGER OF EVERYDAY XENOPHOBIA: Russian human rights groups marked the pan-European day against racism on Thursday by releasing some startling figures. In 2006, attacks fueled by ethnic hatred have left at least 36 dead and 345 injured in Russia. Experts believe that there are about 10 dangerous ultranationalist and racist organizations operating in Russia. The biggest danger, according to analysts of this problem, comes from the stark rise in xenophobia among the general population. 
 WHO'S MORE AUTHORITARIAN? President Viktor A. Yushchenko's Our Ukraine party may discuss the possibility of repealing constitutional reforms restricting presidential powers when party members meet on Saturday. According to Mr. Yushchenko's parliamentary representative, increasing presidential powers may be the only way to offset the authoritarian tendencies of Ukraine's prime minister, Viktor F. Yanukovich. According to the newspaper, the ''cold war'' between the president and prime minister is slowly but steadily developing into open confrontation. 
 IZVESTIA
 KOZLOV KILLERS' CLOUDY HISTORY: The three suspects accused of murdering Andrei Kozlov, the former deputy head of the Russian Central Bank, may have been members of a criminal organization in Ukraine, the newspaper reported Interfax as saying. According to sources in law enforcement, the three are suspected in a series of bombings in Sebastopol. A source in a Sebastopol organized crime unit told the newspaper he had no information on the three. 
 VEDOMOSTI
 UNITED RUSSIA EYES AGRARIANS: United Russia's leader, Vyachslav Volodin, announced on Thursday that his party planned to absorb one of Russia's smaller parties, though would not say which one. Sources from United Russia, however, said Mr. Volodin had the Agrarian Party in mind. According to one United Russia deputy, his party works closely with the rural electorate that tends to support the agrarians. The Agrarians' chief said that he had not been approached by United Russia with a proposal for unification, and had no plans to join any other party.

HEADLINE: Drug Makers Lead a Broad-Based Retreat

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday for the first time this week as higher oil prices and weaker-than-expected consumer confidence data revived concern that household spending would not support economic growth. The dollar fell to a two-month low against the euro on speculation that China might diversify its currency reserves.
 The drug makers Pfizer, Merck and Johnson & Johnson paced the stock retreat on speculation that a Democratic-controlled Congress would reduce subsidies for medicine. A group of health care shares in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell the most in three years. 
The Dow Jones industrial average declined retreated 73.24 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,103.30, a day after closing at a record. The S.& P. 500 lost 7.39 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,378.33. 
 A rally in Cisco Systems, which predicted faster-than-expected sales growth, limited the decline in the Nasdaq composite index. It slipped 8.93 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,376.01.
 Wal-Mart Stores and Procter & Gamble dropped on the prospect of lower consumer spending.
 ''The overall data suggests we're still in a slowdown scenario,'' said Eugene Sit, chief executive of Sit Investment Associates, which manages $6.3 billion in Minneapolis. ''The question on investors' minds is whether this will lead to something more serious and what impact it will have on profits.''
 Crude oil rose to the highest price this month after an Energy Department report showed that domestic diesel supplies fell for a fourth week.
 Diesel inventories plunged 2.92 million barrels, to 78.4 million last week. Crude oil stockpiles rose 435,000 barrels. OPEC may cut output next month, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said Monday.
 ''The big draw in distillate stocks coupled with the small size of the gain in crude oil supplies is in part responsible for this rally,'' said Nauman Barakat, senior vice president for global energy futures at Macquarie Futures USA in New York. ''We're digesting the Saudi statement that the market is oversupplied. The Saudis are moderates and usually don't push for cuts.''
 Crude oil for December delivery rose $1.22, to $61.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest close since Oct. 25. Prices are up 3.8 percent from a year ago.
 The dollar fell after Reuters reported that the governor of the People's Bank of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, said that he had a ''clear'' plan to diversify the country's foreign-exchange reserves.
 China's foreign-currency reserves have exceeded $1 trillion to become the most ever held by a single country, China Central Television reported. United States assets may comprise 72 percent of China's reserves, according to Miller Tabak & Company in New York.
 ''The market is taking this as a hint that China may speed up its pace of diversification away from the dollar and into other currencies,'' said Alan Ruskin, head of international currency strategy in North America at RBS Greenwich Capital Markets in Greenwich, Conn.
 The dollar traded at $1.2824 per euro, compared with $1.2773 on Wednesday. The dollar touched $1.2848, the lowest since $1.2875 on Sept. 5. It traded at 117.97 yen, compared with 117.73. The dollar earlier reached 118.59 yen.
 Treasuries were little changed, with yields on benchmark 10-year notes hovering near the lowest in a week, after the government sold $13 billion of the securities at the lowest yield since February. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rose 2/32, to 101 30/32. The yield remained near 4.63 percent at auction.

HEADLINE: The Dress Code Is Relaxed, but the Courting Is Intense 

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Dozens of the world's biggest media moguls and investment bankers, dressed in perfectly pressed suits, mingled in the lobby of the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan yesterday at the annual FourSquare conference.
 And then there was Mark Zuckerberg, the 22-year-old chief executive of the social networking site Facebook, wearing Adidas flip-flops -- sans socks -- with a blazer and jeans.
Welcome to Web 2.0, Wall Street style. 
 The FourSquare conference has become the East Coast incarnation of Allen & Company's annual summer gathering in Sun Valley, Idaho, which has been the hatching place for all kinds of major and minor deals.
 And if Chad Hurley, the chief executive of YouTube, was the belle of the ball at Sun Valley this summer, then Mr. Zuckerberg was the ''it'' boy of FourSquare.
 Mr. Hurley was also in attendance yesterday, still basking in the glow of his company's sale to Google for $1.65 billion -- and also wearing a blazer and jeans, though he had shoes on. 
 YouTube's sale may be only a month old, but Wall Street had already appeared to move on to the next big deal with all eyes on Mr. Zuckerberg, who has been in on-and-off negotiations with Yahoo. At the conference yesterday, Mr. Zuckerberg could be seen standing amid a throng of high-powered would-be suitors. Analysts have estimated that Facebook could have a value of as much as $1 billion.
 Mr. Zuckerberg demurred when asked whether he would sell to Yahoo. (Terry S. Semel, Yahoo's chief executive, was also in attendance, though he was not seen talking to Mr. Zuckerberg.)
 Many speakers and attendees at the conference, including Barry Diller of IAC/InterActiveCorp, Shari E. Redstone of National Amusements, David J. Stern of the National Basketball Association, Martin Sorell of WPP and Harvey Weinstein of the Weinstein Company, among others, attended a dinner the night before, where much of the conversation was about the YouTube deal and its astronomical price tag. Several people questioned whether Internet valuations had once again gotten out of control. 
 ''We've seen how this movie ends,'' said one executive at a traditional media company who nonetheless was still looking at a bevy of new media acquisitions. ''But we all believe we can change the ending.''
 Among the companies being whispered about as takeover targets were sites with user-generated content like Digg and del.icio.us and other video sites like Brightcove.
 The two-day FourSquare conference, now in its fifth year, has become a hot spot for executives to see and be seen and also attracts much of Wall Street's banker elite. The conference is run by the Quadrangle Group, a private equity firm that specializes in media and technology. The firm was founded in 2000 by Steven Rattner, Peter R. Ezersky and Joshua L Steiner.
 Much of the conference also focused on how user-generated content was upsetting the traditional media model and whether it was a fad or here to stay.
 During a luncheon panel, Howard Stringer, chief of Sony, joked that in 10 years, ''I will be on my MySpace page entirely alone.'' 
 Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian, lamented the quality of the comedy on user-generated YouTube clips. ''It's terrible,'' he said. Mr. Stringer retorted, ''It's funny to them.''
 The discussion turned to how the erosion of the economics of television had forced networks like NBC to decide to show only lower-budget reality and game show fare during part of evening prime time.
 ''I think of the entertainment industry and Detroit similarly,'' Mr. Seinfeld said as he dressed down the television executives in the room for not being bolder in their programming. ''They don't have confidence in their instincts. Maybe they don't have instincts to be confident in?''
 For all the technological shifts going on in media, Mr. Stringer described an article from Time magazine in 1960 that lamented the dearth of new programming on television. ''Nothing changes,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Are High Credit Ratings Just a Thing of the Past?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
IS it a good thing to have a high credit rating?
 More and more corporations have their doubts that the answer is yes. There are still companies with solid balance sheets, but they tend to be the older and the more staid. New companies see little value in that. 
''You have an incredible amount of liquidity sloshing around in the market,'' said Diana Vazza, the head of global fixed-income research for Standard & Poor's, the bond rating company. 
 Much of that money is seeking higher returns, and is thus willing to accept higher risks. That willingness to buy has meant that borrowers with dubious credit end up paying relatively little for the money. 
 Of the companies receiving their first ratings from Standard & Poor's this year, fewer than 10 percent received investment grade. 
 The median rating for all American nonfinancial companies is now BB, or relatively high-quality junk. A decade ago, the median rating was BBB, an investment grade rating.
 Then, as can be seen in the accompanying charts, 41 percent of all American corporate borrowers earned ratings of A or better; now the figure is 16 percent. Then, 23 percent earned ratings of B or worse; now the figure is 39 percent. 
 In Europe, the same trends are under way, but are less far along. There the median rating has fallen to BBB from A. But most newly rated companies are happy to be rated lower than that. In fact, 69 percent of them get junk ratings. And while a decade ago 4 in 10 European borrowers could boast AA or better ratings, now the figure is only 8 percent. 
 Buyers seem more and more willing to accept lower quality credit. Ms. Vazza reports that in the United States even better quality junk bonds are becoming rare. Among new high-yield issues in the third quarter, 45 percent were rated B- or lower. That is a very low rating.
 And yet default rates remain low. S.& P. reported this week that just 1.3 percent of all corporate bonds went into default over the last 12 months, while the figure in Europe is just 0.5 percent. It expects the United States rate to rise to 3.5 percent by early 2008, but that is still below historic averages.
 Some companies that would have defaulted in earlier times, Ms. Vazza said, can avoid that fate simply by refinancing their debts. Lenders, including hedge funds and private equity funds, retain a lively appetite for risk.
 There is something circular here: Almost no one defaults because almost everyone can borrow. That defaults are few reassures lenders there is little danger.
 There will be a catch one of these days. If and when credit tightens -- in the sense that lenders are less willing to lend to poor credits -- then many companies are likely to find that they are in trouble that they cannot ride out without new loans, which would be unavailable. The problem could be particularly acute if it came when the country was in a recession.

HEADLINE: As Rally Ages, Old Standbys Take the Lead

BYLINE: By CONRAD de AENLLE

 BODY:
BULL markets do not go on forever, but many of the leaders of this one seem to have been in business forever. Their stability and financial strength, and their dominant positions in diverse industries, may buy the rally more time, with them in the vanguard.
 Nearly all of the 10 largest contributors to the 12.4 percent total return this year in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- the companies that, by virtue of their size and share price performance, have had the biggest influence on the change in the index -- are longstanding marquee names in corporate America. Four even have histories that stretch back a century, give or take. 
The old-timers are Exxon Mobil, the world's biggest energy concern; two giants of financial services, Bank of America and J. P. Morgan Chase; and AT&T, the phone company founded by Alexander Graham Bell.
 The other six are comparative upstarts, but they are all among the leaders in their fields: the investment bank Goldman Sachs; Cisco Systems, the dominant supplier of Internet infrastructure; the drug maker Merck; Comcast, a provider of cable television service; the computer maker Hewlett-Packard; and BellSouth, once a part of AT&T and soon to be one again after regulators approved their merger.
 Jim Huguet, president of Great Companies Funds, finds a lot to like in this group, with five of them-- Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, Morgan, Goldman and Bank of America -- in his portfolios.
 ''When you look at those companies,'' he said, ''they do business all over the world, they're very well managed and they tend to have strong protective barriers that make it difficult for competition to come in.'' 
 That is what they have in common. He also likes the differences. The 10 stocks represent six distinct sectors of the economy, none with more than three companies. Contrast this list with the 10 biggest contributors to the S.& P. 500 in 1999, just before the stock market tanked. Eight of the 10 were in technology, including Cisco, the only name making a repeat appearance, and many of them had only fleeting trading histories.
 The fascination with unproven businesses concentrated in one segment of the economy, and the dearth of interest in almost anything else, made sense at the time to believers in a new economic era, but it could not be sustained. It was like a one-legged stool that was bound to topple over, no matter how vigorously the cognoscenti extolled its radical new design.
 ''Traditional companies back then were cast aside,'' said Walter McCormick, lead manager of the Evergreen Fundamental Large Cap fund. ''The market was concentrated into a couple of dozen tech-related big names. Now it's much more balanced.''
 But it took a while to get that way. Mr. McCormick pointed out that only in the last year or so have blue chips found favor again with investors.
 ''For four of the last five years these stocks haven't done much,'' he said. ''It looks finally like it's their year in the sun.''
 That has worked well for him. He holds 7 of the 10 leaders, all but Merck; Comcast, which he said was ''one that I wish I'd owned this year''; and BellSouth.
 WHILE blue chips were avoided in favor of smaller companies, emerging markets, precious metals and whatever other fad captured investors' imaginations, they continued to make good money, sending their valuations ever lower. They finally became too cheap to ignore, and concerns that economic growth was decelerating strengthened the case for owning them.
 ''Most people would argue that we're at the latter stage of economic expansion,'' said Stephen Biggar, director of American equity research at Standard & Poor's. ''When we're on the precipice of a possible slowdown, it's not the time to go into high-risk situations. There has been a rotation into high-quality names -- large companies you can depend on for earnings and dividend growth.''
 The economy may be rolling over and share prices are close to multiyear highs, but Mr. Huguet offered another reason to expect the rally, especially in big names like these, to persist. The stocks that are leading the way may remind some investors of themselves: stable, well-off and mature -- but with plenty of life left in them yet.
 ''As you get an aging population, people become more conservative as investors,'' he explained. ''They're looking at retirement and saying, 'We need to put our money in companies that have been around for years. I don't want to own the hottest stock on the Street. I want to own something I can count on.' ''

HEADLINE: The Paradoxes Of Businesses As Do-Gooders 

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
The annual Business for Social Responsibility conference came to New York this week, and it only seemed as though half of corporate America ground to a halt to attend. Starbucks was there, of course, in force, but companies like Chevron, J. C. Penney, Pfizer, McDonald's, Ford Motor and Exxon Mobil all had representatives as well, according to the program. You'd be surprised at the range of companies that are embracing the corporate responsibility mantle. Certainly, I was.
 Corporate Social Responsibility, as the movement is called by its adherents, has gone mainstream. The Grand Hyatt Hotel in Midtown Manhattan was teeming with some 1,200 corporate practitioners, experts, headhunters, academics and consultants. (Business for Social Responsibility, which runs the conference, is one of the leading consultants.) ''It's become a sexy field, and lots of people want to get into it,'' said someone at my luncheon table on Wednesday, the first day of the conference. That was easy enough to see. 
You could walk through the exhibition area and pick up fat reports -- fatter in some cases than the annual report --from General Electric or Coca-Cola listing all the things they are doing to make the world a better place: saving the environment, building projects in the third world, ensuring that the labor they employ in developing countries work in decent conditions and get a fair wage. You could attend packed breakout sessions with titles like ''Being Green Is Glorious: Beijing's Green Olympics.'' You could watch Time Warner's chief executive, Richard D. Parsons, parry questions about corporate responsibility in the media industry. You could listen to just about everybody talk about the need for corporations to confront climate change.
 And you could listen to people say over and over that being socially responsible just made good business sense, and had become critical to the way their companies did business. ''This is core to the way we do business,'' said Bob Langert of McDonald's, the company's vice president for corporate citizenship.
 And you could wonder about that.
 OVER 35 years ago, the economist Milton Friedman wrote a famous article for The New York Times Magazine entitled, ''The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase its Profits.'' It's not hard to find critics of corporate social responsibility who still take that hard-line view. 
 ''C.S.R. is a misguided attempt by a subcategory of business managers to deal with the crisis of corporate legitimacy,'' said Isaac Post of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Russell Roberts, an economist at George Mason University, said: ''Doesn't it make more sense to have companies do what they do best, make good products at fair prices, and then let consumers use the savings for the charity of their choice?'' Their essential point is that companies are simply not equipped to ''save the world'' -- nor is it their mission. That's what governments are supposed to do.
 The truth is, though, companies have rarely viewed their role solely as generating profit. Do the shareholders come first -- above other ''stakeholders'' (a favorite buzzword at the conference, by the way, encompassing customers, employees, activists, and so on)? Of course. And in hard times, when profits evaporate, social goals tend to disappear as well. But there is something a little too nihilistic about so narrow and mercenary a goal; most people want more purpose than that. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, the major American companies tended to underwrite many of the large, important endeavors in their headquarters cities: the opera, the big charities, the museums, and so on. These were clearly peripheral to what the company did, but nobody seemed to mind. Nor did they care that the money came out of the shareholders' pockets. 
 Much of that old paternalism died as the global economy heated up, and ''shareholder value'' became the modern mantra. And in fact, what initially spurred the modern corporate social responsibility movement was the rise of nonprofit activist groups, which pushed and prodded -- and boycotted -- companies to force them toward, say, treating workers better in developing countries. 
 But then the thing took on a life of its own. Nike, which had been the subject of fierce criticism in the 1990s over the labor practices in the factories it engaged to make its goods, decided it made sense to go the other way completely. It has worked to raise labor standards in the factories it does business with, and now has an extensive monitoring program. Its customers took comfort in that, and so did its employees. Did it help sales? It's hard to say. But no one's complaining that shareholder money is being wasted. That's what the culture was demanding.
 Most recently, the environment has taken center stage; indeed, it would be hard to think of anything that has done more to propel the corporate social responsibility movement than the realization that global warming is a real phenomenon with potentially dire consequences. So corporations have raced to get on the right side of that issue.
 ''We struggled with climate change at Ford,'' said Niel Golightly, who was formerly Ford Motor's corporate responsibility maven. (He recently moved to Shell.) ''We were among the first in the industry to openly acknowledge it,'' -- and that was something, he added, that he took pride in. Ford also worked to make its plants ''environmentally responsible,'' to use the words on its Web site. 
 In fact, virtually all of the companies at the conference have set goals for reducing greenhouse gases, and making their operations more energy efficient. I talked to Mark F. Buckley, the vice president for environmental affairs at Staples. He waxed on about how the company had set carbon reduction goals, and had reduced the energy used per square foot in its stores by 14 percent. It was working to help its customers recycle, and reducing the environmental impact of its own branded products. ''And it makes the company money,'' he said.
 From the left, the essential criticism of corporate social responsibility is that it is little more than window-dressing, intended to give companies a good name without having to back it up with real deeds. ''There is a whole lot of lip service,'' said Judith Melby of Christian Aid, a British-based aid group -- and a tough critic of corporate behavior. But when you actually see what these companies are doing, at least the ones at the conference, it is hard to write it off as all window-dressing. Surely, it's a good thing that companies are trying to lower their energy costs and become more environmentally sensitive. Will that alone solve the problem of global warming? Hardly. But I wound up thinking: why not? It's better than nothing. And the fact that most corporations are now facing up to the problem of global warming instead of denying it -- that's real progress. 
 But as to whether it really is ''core'' to their business, that struck me as another question entirely. ''It always makes sense for people to act more responsibly,'' said Paul Hawken, the co-founder of Smith & Hawken and a well-known corporate critic and environmentalist. ''But what are they responding to? They are responding to stakeholder pressure. To the zeitgeist. To their own internal cultures, as employees retire and younger people take their place. But,'' he added, ''corporate social responsibility is a very safe place to talk about these things. By safe, I mean it doesn't challenge the business model.''
 And he's right about that. McDonald's may support sustainable fisheries, but its core business is still selling Big Macs. Big oil companies can talk all they want about reducing greenhouse emissions but they are still drilling for hydrocarbons. And Ford Motor, well, think for a minute about the predicament that company is in.
 When William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of the founder, first became chairman in 1999, he talked up his environmental credentials. And internally, Ford has had a first-rate corporate social responsibility program. But for most of his tenure as both chairman and chief executive (he recently stepped down as C.E.O.), the bulk of Ford's profits have come from gas-guzzling trucks and S.U.V.'s -- even as Toyota was working on hybrids and other autos that get better gas mileage and are better for the environment. Would Mr. Ford and his company have been better off if he had taken those environmental values and applied them to the core business of making cars? It's hard to imagine it could have made things worse.
 ''Bill Ford understood that we needed to be prepared for better fuel economy,'' Mr. Golightly said, ''but those things are difficult to do.''
 On the second day of the conference, Amory Lovins, co-founder of the Rocky Mountain Institute, made a passionate speech laying out a logical -- if quite radical -- plan for significantly lowering energy consumption. He showed pictures of prototypes of aerodynamic automobiles that used light-weight materials and could get three to five times better fuel economy. The people in the audience were dazzled -- as was I -- but I couldn't help thinking that that kind of radical new auto design, which spoke directly to the business model of the auto industry, wasn't about to happen anytime soon. It's a lot easier to come out against global warming than it is to change, fundamentally, the way you do business.
 ''Value systems change,'' said Dr. Daniel Vasella, the chief executive of Novartis, during his keynote, ''and it is our duty to adapt our behavior when and where appropriate.'' That's really what has happened here: as the values of Western consuming culture have changed, companies have begun to change with them. That is what the rise of corporate social responsibility really represents.
 If the movement takes that next step -- if it really does become about the core business model -- it won't be because corporations have led the way. It will be because the rest of us have.

HEADLINE: Shares Up, Led by Home Builders

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, wrapping up their sixth weekly gain in the last seven weeks, as falling oil prices lifted companies that thrive in an expanding economy. Treasuries had their biggest weekly gain since September on speculation that the government would curb spending.
 KB Home, D. R. Horton and Centex led a rally among home builders, the best performers in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Solectron, a maker of electronic components, had the index's biggest gain after saying that it would meet or exceed profit forecasts. 
''I'm very positive on this market as the basic fundamentals are back in place,'' said John Merrill, who helps manage about $475 million as president and founder of Tanglewood Capital Management in Houston. ''It's hard to have better earnings. The market does have further room to rise.''
 The S.& P. 500 rose 2.57 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,380.90. The Nasdaq composite index increased 13.71 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,389.72, its highest close since February 2001.
 Walt Disney weighed on the Dow Jones industrial average, which added 5.13 points, to 12,108.43. Disney said that a higher tax rate might reduce earnings next year.
 In the last five days, the S.& P. 500 rose 1.2 percent, the Dow gained 1 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 2.5 percent. Technology companies led the weekly advance on better-than-expected earnings and expectation that gridlock in Congress might forestall new regulations.
 Treasuries also rose on expectations that demand for new securities would climb. Democratic control of Congress may lead to lower spending.
 Yesterday's gain helped bonds erase losses from Nov. 3, when a government report showed that the national unemployment rate fell to a five-year low, raising concern that growth might be strong enough to allow the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates steady.
 The 10-year Treasury note rose 6/32, to 100 9/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.59 percent, from 4.63 percent.
 Yesterday, crude oil fell the most this month after the International Energy Agency cut its demand forecast for the third consecutive month.
 World oil demand this year will average 84.49 million barrels a day, 80,000 barrels a day less than estimated last month, the agency said. Slower growth in Chinese use of transport fuels, especially gasoline, was behind the revision, it said. China, the world's second-biggest oil consumer, behind the United States, is still expected to drive growth this year and next.
 ''The I.E.A. has cut its demand forecast for three months in a row, which could be the start of a trend,'' said Kyle Cooper, director of research at IAF Advisors in Houston. ''This is very different from 2004 and 2005 when we saw demand revised higher repeatedly. This may be evidence that these high prices are putting a lid on demand growth.''
 Crude oil for December delivery fell $1.57, or 2.6 percent, to $59.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices were up 0.8 percent this week and are 3.1 percent higher than a year ago.
 The dollar declined versus the euro and yen after the head of China's central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan, said the nation would keep diversifying its foreign exchange reserves.
 The dollar fell after Mr. Zhou said China would ''stick to the existing policy'' of reducing the share of United States assets it holds. The European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, and the Bank of Japan governor, Toshihiko Fukui, suggested this week that they would raise interest rates, adding to the allure of their currencies.
 ''It was just a timely reminder there is a potential the Chinese central bank will diversify out of dollars into euros and even sterling,'' said Mike Moran, senior currency strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. ''People have forgotten about this in a market where the dollar bears are winning out.''
 The dollar traded at $1.2847 per euro from $1.2824 on Thursday and $1.2718 a week ago. The dollar has declined about 1 percent this week versus the euro.

HEADLINE: Ortega Redux: A History Smolders on Cold War Embers

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
For most of the world, the cold war ended when the Berlin Wall came down. Not so in the Caribbean basin. 
 Here the stubbornness of old cold warriors in Washington and the equal tenacity of leftist governments in Cuba and Venezuela have kept a miniature cold war going. Just as it was 20 years ago, Nicaragua now finds itself smack in the middle of the conflict with the election this week of Daniel Ortega, the former Marxist rebel leader, as president.
Mr. Ortega faces a balancing act no politician would envy, both inside the country and on the world stage. On the one hand, to satisfy his supporters, he must fulfill promises to ''eradicate poverty,'' curb ''savage capitalism,'' and remain friendly with his leftist allies, Fidel Castro of Cuba and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. Venezuela, in particular, could be a source of cheap oil and money for social programs. 
 On the other hand, he can ill afford to lose more than $50 million a year in United States aid or credit from the International Monetary Fund. Neither can Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, jettison the newly approved free trade agreement between Central American countries and the United States. Just to survive economically, this nation of some 5.6 million people needs to continue exporting textiles and fruit to the United States and receiving remittances from Nicaraguans in the north. 
 ''Nicaragua is basically a welfare state that depends on foreign inputs to survive, remittances and foreign aid,'' said an American diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
 What is more, Mr. Ortega won with only 38 percent of the vote, and the National Assembly is divided among four parties. Every move he makes will involve negotiation and compromise with conservative lawmakers, who are desperate not to anger the Bush administration. 
 ''The problems facing him make it almost impossible to have a successful presidency,'' said Larry Birns, the director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs in Washington. ''He has no arrows in his quiver.''
 Mr. Ortega's precarious position may explain the careful nuance in his recent speeches. He ran on a rosy and vague promise of ''jobs, peace and reconciliation,'' seldom attacked the United States, avoided Marxist rhetoric and wore his newfound religious convictions on his sleeve. These days he talks more on the stump about God than the proletariat.
 For the moment, Mr. Ortega is walking very softly and speaking in dulcet tones. ''Today more than ever, the Sandinistas have to be patient,'' he said to ecstatic Sandinista Party supporters after his victory this week. ''We are not going to fall into provocations or insult anyone.''
 Still, once in a while, the old revolutionary flares in him. He has called President Bush ''the Reagan of these times,'' and asserted that the ''Yankee Reagan'' wanted ''to bring death and destruction to the region.'' Sometimes, he rails against the havoc the free trade agreement has wrought on small farms.
 Since the election, he has taken pains to calm businessmen, assuring foreign investors on Wednesday that he will protect property rights in exchange for help combating poverty. ''No one is going to allow the seizure of property big or small,'' he said. He has also reached out to his political opponents, saying he will keep in place reforms limiting the president's power.
 Yet at his victory speech later the same day, Mr. Ortega made it clear that he would not be Washington's lackey. He thanked his leftist ''brothers,'' Mr. Castro and Mr. Chavez, then took a dig at Washington, saying it was not the Sandinistas who broke off relations after the 1979 revolution. ''It was the reverse,'' he said. 
 He also said he would push the country, which currently sells more than 60 percent of its exports to the United States, to join the anti-United States trade association Mr. Chavez wants to organize. And he said he would seek trade agreements with Europe and South America. ''We have to know how to make our economy grow not depending on only one market,'' he said.
 So far, the Bush administration has taken a wait-and-see attitude in the face of what seems like two different Ortegas. A State Department spokesman, Gonzalo Gallegos, said the United States' cooperation with Mr. Ortega would be ''based on their action in support of Nicaragua's democratic future.''
 Meanwhile, Mr. Castro and Mr. Chavez have used Mr. Ortega's victory to feed their own propaganda machines. 
 In Havana, Mr. Castro put out a statement saying the victory ''fills our people with joy, at the same time filling the terrorist and genocidal government of the United States with opprobrium.'' In Caracas, Mr. Chavez claimed he and Mr. Ortega would be ''uniting as never before'' to construct a socialist future.
 The outcome of this tug of war hinges on what steps Washington takes, several experts on the region said. The Bush administration has many high-ranking officials who were involved to one degree or another in the covert war against the Sandinistas and Mr. Ortega in the 1980s, among them Robert M. Gates, the man Mr. Bush put forward to be the new secretary of defense. 
 So even though Nicaragua is hardly a threat to national security, the memories of the 1980s may influence the Bush administration's policies, some experts say. ''One of the big questions is, independent of what Ortega does, what approach will the U.S. take?'' said Geoff Thale of the Washington Office on Latin America, an independent research group.
 People who know Mr. Ortega worry his temper will get the best of him if Washington tries to put pressure on him. 
 ''The worst thing that could happen is if Daniel Ortega extends his hand to Bush and Bush rejects it,'' said Sergio Ramirez, who was the vice president in the late 1980s under Mr. Ortega. ''What will happen is that he's going to say, 'Fine, I will go with Chavez.' ''

HEADLINE: Renewal of 1960s Marina Blocks Coveted Views and Irks Boaters 

BYLINE: By CINDY CHANG

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
From the dockside patio he often uses as an office, Don Davidson can hear waves lapping against pleasure boats just a few feet away and the answering creaks as the vessels shift on their moorings.
 In addition to its proximity to the water, Mr. Davidson's second-floor apartment once had a view -- a sweeping vista of the Santa Monica Mountains to the north and the iconic Hollywood sign far to the east. That view disappeared a year ago after construction began on a five-story luxury apartment complex on a neighboring dock.
Marina del Rey is changing, and many residents are already mourning the loss of their slow-paced boater's paradise, an oasis of relative calm on Los Angeles's moneyed, traffic-plagued Westside. 
 The unfinished building that blocks Mr. Davidson's view is just one of many new additions to the marina. Under construction or winding their way through a byzantine approval process, these include at least five other large apartment complexes as well as several hotels and retail plazas. Los Angeles County officials say that the new development, which they engineered as part of a plan to invigorate the aging marina, will attract more residents and visitors and generate as much as $30 million a year in new revenue. 
 ''The marina needs to be upgraded, but I hope that doesn't change the nice, casual, cozy, slower, eclectic lifestyle,'' said Mr. Davidson, 60, the owner of an Internet marketing company.
 Marina del Rey has built the largest recreational marina in the world, according to the Marina del Rey Convention and Visitors Bureau -- though it will be eclipsed by one under construction in Dubai. Its more than 5,000 boat slips and 804 acres of land and waterways are owned by the county. Aside from a few hundred condominiums, most housing consists of rental apartments. 
 But with its low-lying 1960s-vintage buildings and faux-Cape Cod shopping plaza, the marina is also a major financial underachiever. County officials expect the $30 million or so a year its leases earn to double as the addition of about 3,000 high-end apartments, new Woodfin and Marriott hotels and businesses like the Cheesecake Factory enhances land values.
 Only about 8,000 people live in Marina del Rey, which is an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County; about half its acreage is under water. The population would increase significantly as four- and five-story apartment buildings replace two- and three-story ones just off the water.
 ''Obviously, we've always considered Marina del Rey the crown jewel of Los Angeles County,'' said Don Knabe, a Los Angeles County supervisor whose coastal district includes Marina del Rey. ''But it's one of those jewels that needs a little polishing.'' 
 For many local residents, the marina's slightly dilapidated look is part of its charm. They view the marina's original ring-based design, with smaller buildings unobtrusively blending with the clutter of boat masts in central areas and high-rise apartments at the perimeter, as holy doctrine. ''I think it should be upgraded, but why should they have to make it bigger and higher?'' said Don Klein, head of the Coalition to Save the Marina, a residents group that has filed several lawsuits to stop the new development. ''If they want to build it, they should keep the heights the way they are now, limit traffic and cars and don't mess with parking lots. They need to keep it to a reasonable and sensible thing.'' 
 With more apartments and more tourists will inevitably come more traffic, which residents complain has already increased to intolerable levels as other large-scale housing developments go up in surrounding areas. A planned extension of the Marina Freeway to the marina itself would add to the congestion.
 Boaters complain that wind patterns are being thrown off, as winds bounce off new, taller buildings and gusts weaken. Some say the county's new boat slip designs favor large boats at the expense of smaller ones.
 ''They have a cash cow and they want to exploit it as much as possible,'' Irving Beid, head of the 500-member Del Rey Yacht Club, said of county officials. ''In my and other people's opinions, they should be more concerned with the boating community that supports Marina del Rey, versus the people who come in and use the services.''
 In the early days after the marina was completed in 1965, its bars and restaurants were a magnet for singles. The social scene now is mostly confined to locals, who include yuppies, 60-something bachelors, and sailing fanatics who pay only a few hundred dollars a month to live aboard their boats.
 Some residents fear that with the increase in rents that new high-end housing is sure to bring, the marina's diverse mix of residents will disappear along with the unobstructed vistas of boat masts and Pacific sunsets. 
 ''You'll have a much more homogenous population, a much wealthier and more exclusive community,'' said Nancy V. Marino, an anti-development advocate who has lived here for 18 years.
 Even now, living at the marina is expensive. The going rate for a one-bedroom apartment is at least $2,200 a month. 
 But county officials point to a state requirement that a percentage of new construction must be set aside as housing for low- and moderate income families. The marina belongs not just to the people who live there now, the officials say, but to those from other parts of the county who will be attracted to the area by an expanded oceanside park and a new mix of shops and restaurants. 
 ''We have to create economic and physical viability,'' said Kerry Silverstrom, chief deputy director of the county's Department of Beaches and Harbors. ''We just can't have these things aging. Plus, this is an asset for the county of Los Angeles and we need to maximize our return from the land and use this money to fund county services.''
 Mr. Davidson, whose view was blocked by the new apartment complex, is more sanguine about the changes than are many of his neighbors. After a few months of fuming at the loss of his view, he put his name on the waiting list for an apartment in the new building.
 ''I want to get a corner, high-up unit over the channel,'' Mr. Davidson said. ''I was so mad watching them construct that I decided to go the other route.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about development in Marina del Rey referred incorrectly to the marina's construction. It was built by Los Angeles County with help from state and federal money -- not by Marina del Rey, which is an unincorporated area of the county.

HEADLINE: Slow Home Grants Stall Progress in New Orleans

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
The $7.5 billion program to rebuild Louisiana by helping residents repair or replace their flooded homes has gotten off to a slow start, frustrating government officials and outraging many homeowners who say they are still in limbo 14 months after Hurricane Katrina hit.
 Though nearly 79,000 families have applied to the program, called the Road Home, only 1,721 have been told how much grant money they will receive. And just 22 have received access to the cash, which was provided by federal taxpayers and is being distributed by the state.
 ''I don't know of anyone who has actually received any money,'' said Cassandra D. Wall, who is active in a group of homeowners from the eastern part of New Orleans. Ms. Wall said she planned to attend a protest Nov. 17 in Baton Rouge, the state capital, ''to go public with the outrage and the outcry.''
 Many hopes have been pinned on the Road Home program, which is widely considered the most important factor in rebuilding the ruined neighborhoods of New Orleans and is also meant to start an economic boom in southern Louisiana. Homeowners who rebuild or buy new houses in the state are eligible for grants of up to $150,000 to cover their uninsured losses, although the average award has been about $68,000. 
 The city's mayor, C. Ray Nagin, is so dissatisfied with the pace of the program that on Nov. 1 he announced that the city was developing a plan to lend money to people waiting for their Road Home grants.
 [Officials announced on Nov. 6 that Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco had ordered the contractor managing the program to calculate 10,000 awards by the end of the month.]
 ''It's time to kick into high gear,'' said Walter Leger, a lawyer and a member of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which devised the federally financed Road Home program. ''It's time to forget the reasons and excuses'' for the slow pace so far.
 In some ways, the program's low-speed beginning reflects an urgent need to avoid the kind of waste and fraud that plagued federal programs after the hurricane. The government, among other things, is demanding that applicants produce details of insurance policies and payouts, proof of title to a house, and, if possible, official assessments of a home's prestorm value. Many New Orleans residents lost such paperwork in the flood, or never had it in the first place.
 But the larger explanation is that the program is, in effect, a giant experiment.
 ''There is no precedent,'' said Andy Kopplin, executive director of the recovery authority. ''Louisiana's version is the single largest housing assistance program ever done anywhere.''
 The only similar program is in Mississippi, which got a full Congressional appropriation for its roughly $3 billion plan months before Louisiana got the full $7.5 billion it asked for. The Mississippi program is smaller and differs in many details; fewer people are eligible, for example, and the grants do not have to be used for housing.
 But Mississippi's program has been plagued by some of the same problems, including a slow start that drew public criticism from, among others, Trent Lott, the state's junior Republican senator. New data from the program show that it has now paid $320.6 million in 5,201 grants -- but officials had originally planned to have given out most of the grants by the end of August, the first anniversary of the storm.
 Some Louisiana officials also point out that the Mississippi program got a public-relations black eye when it turned out that several state lawmakers had won a lucrative legal contract with the program. No accusations of fraud or conflicts of interest have surfaced in Louisiana's program. 
 That is not much comfort to people like Lisa A. Lincoln, a social worker flooded out of New Orleans who now lives about 130 miles away, near Lafayette. Ms. Lincoln applied for a Road Home grant in August. She was interviewed, her house was inspected and her thumbprint was taken as a fraud-prevention measure. 
 But she still has not heard if she will get a grant to repair her Creole cottage in the Gentilly neighborhood of New Orleans. The house still needs at least $60,000 worth of work, she said; it took all her insurance money, and help from community groups, to gut it and install some wallboard.
 The delay appears to be that the program has to verify that she had insurance, and how much it paid her, she said. ''And that could take however long to get,'' she said. ''I'm in limbo.''
 Dealing with the insurance companies is just one challenge the program has faced, said Michael Byrne, a former New York City firefighter who is now chief program executive for ICF International, the private company the state hired to run the Road Home program.
 Complicated federal regulations bar what is called ''duplication of benefits,'' so anyone who received insurance money or housing assistance from a different government agency, like the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has to document it and have it subtracted from the Road Home grant. And there have been computer systems to coordinate, documents to verify, hundreds of people to hire and offices to open across the state and, soon, in Houston.
 Even figuring out how much a house was worth before the storm -- the cap on the amount of a grant -- is difficult, slow and often controversial. 
 Michael M. Homan, a professor of theology at Xavier University, is among the few who has been told how much he can get to repair his badly damaged house in the Mid-City neighborhood. But Professor Homan thinks the amount he was offered, about $64,000, is too low.
 That is because the program assigned a prestorm value to his house of $146,000, less than he paid for it in 2002 and about $40,000 less than the appraisal when he refinanced his mortgage the next year. So he has appealed, and is hoping that his grant will be increased. Because he writes about his experiences on the Internet (at michaelhoman.blogspot.com), his results are being anxiously watched by other applicants. 
 Professor Homan said he was not dissatisfied with the program, compared with his other experiences after the storm. It has been, he said, ''a year of incredible frustration,'' starting when the levees broke. He had flood insurance, but is suing his insurance company, which denied his claim for wind damage.
 It is not just the financial strain. As anyone here will tell you, trying to live in New Orleans is hard. Professor Homan, his wife and two children are living in the second story of their tilted house and in a FEMA trailer parked out front. Around them, some houses look abandoned, and a few have waist-high weeds in their yards.
 Because housing in New Orleans has traditionally been relatively inexpensive, limiting grants to the prestorm value of a house may keep many people from rebuilding, said Melanie Ehrlich, a professor at Tulane University who is a founder of Citizens Road Home Action Team, a group that is pushing for changes in the state program.
 Dr. Ehrlich, a molecular biologist, cites statistics suggesting that before the storm, about 10 percent of the city's houses were valued at less than $50,000, and about two-thirds were valued at less than $125,000, far less than it would cost to build them from scratch. State officials say that low-income homeowners will be eligible for special loans that will be forgiven if they live in their houses for five years. 
 Salvatore S. Barone may be a test case, of sorts. Mr. Barone and his sister inherited a house in the eastern part of New Orleans after their mother died in 2000. Mr. Barone said that the house was valued at about $72,000, and that a contractor told him it would cost $52,000 to fix the flood damage.
 But his situation, like many here, is complicated. His sister, who lived in the house before the storm, failed to pay the insurance or tax bills, probably because she was suffering from dementia, Mr. Barone said, adding that she was now in a nursing home.
 A former driver for United Cabs in New Orleans, Mr. Barone said he was disabled by a stroke a decade ago and lives on $699 a month in federal benefits. He is staying in a trailer in rural Mississippi.
 Though he has applied for a Road Home grant, Mr. Barone must first get his name on the title to the house, a common problem in New Orleans, lawyers there say. 
 Paul Tuttle, the pro bono counsel for Southeast Louisiana Legal Services, said that since the storm, his office had heard from hundreds of people living in family homes that they suddenly have to prove they own.
 And the issue is critical. In Mr. Barone's case, he said, ''I'll be living in a cardboard box under the Interstate if I don't get this grant.''

HEADLINE: Labor Movement Dusts Off Agenda as Power Shifts in Congress

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
After the Republicans took control of the House in 1994, perhaps no group was on the outs as much as organized labor. But now that the Democrats have swept both houses of Congress, the nation's labor unions feel as if they are back -- and then some.
 Eager to be treated as an important force, union leaders have worked overtime since Election Day reminding Democrats about all that organized labor did to help put them over the top, including spending more than $100 million and dispatching more than 100,000 volunteers to help get out the vote.
After years of being sidelined by the Republican majority, the nation's unions are now pushing Congress to act on a long list of issues: improving mine safety, putting a brake on outsourcing, making it easier to unionize workers and extending health coverage to millions of uninsured Americans. 
 ''There's a lot of pent-up demand on organized labor's part,'' said Randel Johnson, vice president for labor, immigration and employee benefits of the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''Money talks, and they dumped a lot of money into the campaign.''
 For now at least, organized labor sounds fully in tune with the presumed House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, because they both want to raise the minimum wage, rein in drug prices and help students with high college tuitions. 
 Representative George Miller, a California Democrat and ally of Ms. Pelosi who is expected to become chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, said, ''There's a strong sense among the members that a lot of middle-class workers are getting left out of the economic growth in this country, and we are eager to do something about that.''
 Mr. Miller and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is expected to head the Senate Labor Committee, say that raising the federal minimum wage will be the first issue they address. 
 ''Clearly the minimum wage is front and center,'' Mr. Miller said.
 Even with Democrats back in power, organized labor faces serious hurdles. Republicans and even some Democrats are uncomfortable with labor's demand to deny the Bush administration trade promotion authority, which makes it easier to negotiate trade pacts because Congress would be barred from amending them. 
 In the Senate, Republicans are likely to use the filibuster to block one of labor's most coveted pieces of legislation, a bill that would in many ways make it easier for unions to organize workers. The bill would, among other things, greatly increase penalties for companies that illegally fire workers to undermine unionization drives. Labor sees the bill, which is co-sponsored by more than 90 percent of House Democrats, as pivotal for reversing labor's decline.
 ''The filibuster, there's no question it's a hurdle,'' said William Samuel, the legislative director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''We will have to build a movement behind this legislation because it will give workers more bargaining power to respond to the loss of pensions, health coverage and jobs with good wages.''
 John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, said unions and the Democrats largely agree on most issues. Mr. Sweeney's wish list includes barring federal contracts for companies that send jobs overseas and making it harder for companies to shed their pension obligations when they file for bankruptcy protection.
 Mr. Sweeney was eager to talk about how well labor did on Election Day. He pointed out that nonunion voters split more or less evenly between Democratic and Republican House candidates, while union members preferred Democratic candidates by a margin of 30 percentage points. 
 Union leaders said that among all voters nationwide, there was a 6.8 million-vote margin in favor of Democrats over Republicans in the House races. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. pointed to exit polls showing that members of union households accounted for 5.6 million of that margin.
 ''We were by far the most powerful turnout engine on the progressive side,'' Mr. Sweeney said. 
 Labor unions helped orchestrate successful minimum wage initiatives in Montana, Missouri, Ohio and three other states. Those efforts encouraged many low-income workers to vote, giving an additional lift to Democrats, especially in close contests like the Senate race in Montana.
 ''The Democrats wouldn't have won nearly as many seats without labor's money and manpower,'' said Larry J. Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.
 Professor Sabato said unions were not as demanding as they had sometimes been in past decades. ''They're not pushing the Democrats far to the left on many subjects,'' he said. ''They want to win, too. They were perfectly willing to back a lot of those moderate to conservative Democrats, who are Blue Dogs.''
 Representative Jim Matheson, a Utah Democrat who is co-chairman of the Blue Dog Coalition of moderate to conservative Democrats, said he strongly supported a higher minimum wage and the Employee Free Choice Act, the bill that would make it easier to unionize workers. 
 ''A lot of Blue Dogs have a strong labor record,'' Mr. Matheson said. ''But I'm a pro-trade Democrat, and that's where labor and I are on different sides of some issues. I'm a strong believer in the economic growth benefits of free trade.''
 Labor is urging Congress to block the ratification of free-trade accords negotiated with Peru and Colombia unless President Bush includes stronger protections on worker rights, human rights and the environment. Many unions have also pledged to oppose granting Mr. Bush new trade promotion authority to help him complete a worldwide trade agreement as well as free-trade accords with individual countries. 
 ''If you look at the new Democrats elected, if they mentioned trade it was almost always unfavorable,'' said Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''Those Democrats are replacing a lot of pro-trade Republicans. There's been a substantial shift.''
 Mr. Hufbauer said Mr. Bush might have to do a lot of horse trading, like agreeing to a higher minimum wage and higher housing subsidies for the poor, to persuade Mr. Sweeney not to block some trade pacts and legislation. 
 When several unions quit the A.F.L.-C.I.O last year, many Democrats feared that the schism would hurt labor's effectiveness in election campaigns. 
 ''People said the split would be terrible for labor in politics,'' said Anna Burger, chairwoman of the breakaway coalition, Change to Win. ''Labor had its best year ever.''
 Ms. Burger said the two union federations were seeking to cooperate on a lobbying program. Her coalition is making a big push for universal health coverage.
 ''More and more workers are losing their health coverage,'' Ms. Burger said. ''We need a way to stop that once and for all. One way to do that is extend the health insurance program that covers everyone in Congress. If it's good enough for them, why isn't it good enough for every American?''

HEADLINE: For Readers, a New Forum for Black Literature 

BYLINE: By CELIA McGEE

 BODY:
Joy Bramble remembers when black writers struggled to attain their dreams and the attention needed to sustain them. 
 ''Now I can't believe how many books are being published by black writers,'' she said. ''It's almost as if we're recognizing suddenly that people want to read them, and we have so many stories to tell.''
 Getting the word out to potential readers, though, has not been easy.
 Publishers and authors still worry that African-American titles receive sparse coverage in the mainstream media -- where the space allotted to books has been dwindling -- while historically black newspapers like The Baltimore Times, where Ms. Bramble is publisher, often have scant resources to cover the arts. 
 But next week The Baltimore Times will join The New York Amsterdam News, The Philadelphia Tribune and several others in introducing Blacks & Books, a monthly insert focusing on books by or of interest to readers of African descent. The project was conceived by Ken Smikle, president of the Chicago-based market research and media consulting company Target Market News, which in March acquired the respected bimonthly magazine Black Issues Book Review.
 ''We're trying to bring an otherwise unheard black perspective about things happening in book publishing across the board,'' said Mr. Smikle, who is publishing Blacks & Books from Black Issues' small, book-stuffed suite of offices on the 15th floor of the Empire State Building. ''I have long thought that black newspapers were underutilized in that area.''
 The first cover story: Senator Barack Obama and his current best seller, ''The Audacity of Hope.''
 Contributors will include Black Issues regulars, as well as freelancers, established authors and newspaper journalists. In addition to reviews and features, there will be a best-seller list, author interviews, a literary calendar and a children's and young-adult section.
 Mr. Smikle has placed day-to-day supervision in the hands of Susan McHenry, a founding editor of Black Issues who returned as editorial director after Mr. Smikle's acquisition. ''The writers will be a combination of familiar names and young people,'' Ms. McHenry said, ''because it's an opportunity to help another generation find a voice.'' 
 The publishing industry is greeting the enterprise and its initial 100,000-copy print run with enthusiasm, and caution. Delivering a national publication to a local, selected readership does make economic sense, publishers said, especially with advertising rates topping out at $8,000 for a full-page color ad and the potential for additional presence in retail outlets, at book festivals and among book clubs. 
 Still, said Sara Nelson, editor in chief of Publishers Weekly: ''In this day and age, with newspapers cutting back on book coverage, I think it's a brave move.'' Even her publication, the book industry's chief trade journal, addresses the flourishing black market primarily ''with several features a year and during Black History Month,'' she said, so she would welcome someone compiling an African-American best-seller list.
 With so little marketing money to spread around, and so much of it going to a handful of high-profile titles, publishers depend on the attention of book reviews. But mainstream reviews often suffer from ''a complete absence of African-American titles,'' said Patrik Henry Bass, the books editor of Essence magazine. ''To read them, you'd think that in a month only one or two are released.''
 Sam Tanenhaus, editor of The New York Times Book Review, said, ''Nothing is sufficiently covered.'' 
 ''We get so many books, and space is so limited,'' he said, ''and we tend to concentrate on serious fiction and nonfiction. So we're more likely to do a big takeout on Edward P. Jones, as we did, and we published Skip Gates's introduction to 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' '' he said, referring to Henry Louis Gates Jr. ''Our books tend to be a small, select group, but that's across the board,'' he added. 
 Instead, African-American authors have come to rely on radio, word of mouth, church group appearances, book signings and the occasional ''Oprah effect.'' The best-selling novelist Terry McMillan, who helped kick-start the upsurge in black books, first introduced herself to a wider public by ''putting her books in the back of her car and driving to churches and conventions and wherever else she could talk to black folks,'' Mr. Smikle said.
 Blacks & Books, he suggested, is his declaration that writers shouldn't have to do that.
 This is especially true now that the larger publishing world has taken notice, adding new imprints and more African-American editors in recent years. The flood of new titles range from literary to populist, chick lit to street lit to spirit lit, Edward P. Jones to Tyler Perry to Tavis Smiley's surprise hit ''The Covenant With Black America.'' Seven-figure deals are being made. 
 Nonetheless, the frustration remains. ''Black authors don't succeed because of the system, but in spite of it,'' Mr. Smikle said.
 When fresh out of Queens College in the early 1970s, Mr. Smikle started with his brother, the photographer Dawoud Bey, a black arts journal called Easy. It was short-lived. 
 ''I wanted to be the black Jann Wenner,'' he said, laughing. His short Afro is graying now, and his wardrobe runs to crisp white shirts and conservative ties. Blacks & Books is a means of joining the system with a twist.
 For the first issue, the cover story by the Chicago journalist Sabrina Miller fits that bill, Ms. McHenry said. Senator Obama's book, following on the success of his memoir ''Dreams From My Father'' (1995), explores this Illinois Democrat's political vision. And, unlike other books by political figures, he actually wrote it, Ms. McHenry said. 
 ''His memoir was one of my absolute favorites,'' she said. ''He's like the 21st-century Frederick Douglass. He gives us an interesting way to launch. As an icon in America and in our community, lots of different hopes are pinned on him.''
 Valerie Boyd, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of Georgia and author of ''Wrapped in Rainbows: The Life of Zora Neale Hurston,'' believes Blacks & Books is an important step. ''For me, as a black writer,'' she said, ''it indicates that there's at least a perception of black people as active and engaged readers who are willing to read new books, which is the opposite of the way the book industry seems to think of them.'' 
 It also means that African-American newspapers can begin to regain the role they once played in the literary marketplace, Mr. Bass said. 
 ''It's gratifying to know that the black press can once again have the continuing presence of books,'' he said. 
 Mr. Smikle knows he and his staff have their work cut out. He doesn't have as many ad pages in the first issue as he would like, and some newspaper markets he has been courting are not yet on board.
 ''I have this theory, though,'' he said. ''When you get an idea, you launch first, and the rest will come.''
 No splashy party is planned, either, Ms. McHenry said. ''We'll have an anniversary party, a celebration of its longevity instead,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Jobs of Investment Bankers Appear to Be Safe 

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
EVEN more than usual, it was a good week to be an investment banker. Certainly better than it was to be a floor specialist at the New York Stock Exchange or the editor of a major metropolitan newspaper.
 Pharmaceutical stocks fell on speculation that Democratic gains in this week's midterm elections would encourage legislative efforts to curb drug prices. Other shares also fell later in the week as weak consumer-confidence data revived concern about spending and economic growth.

DEALS A GO-GO -- Companies that make everything from steaks to forklifts or provide services like hotel rooms and trucking were all on the market this week, in a mergers-and-acquisition bonanza among small and midsize companies.
A pair of private equity firms, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, offered 4 billion euros ($5.1 billion) to buy the forklift-making operations of Linde of Germany, a maker of industrial gases and machinery.
 Private equity investors also swooped down on the Outback Steakhouse casual-dining chain, with Bain Capital and Catterton Partners agreeing to buy the company for $3.2 billion, one of the biggest restaurant deals ever. 
 Abbott Laboratories agreed to $3.7 billion for a smaller prescription drug maker, Kos Pharmaceuticals, which makes Niaspan, a fast-selling drug that raises the level of ''good'' cholesterol, or HDL, in people at risk of heart disease.
 Backed by investment financing from Bill Gates of Microsoft and Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, the chief executive of the Four Seasons Hotels chain, Isadore Sharp, offered to buy the company from its shareholders for $3.7 billion in cash.
 A former chief executive of Swift Transportation, Jerry Moyes, put in a bid for his former employer, a trucking company, offering about $2.2 billion.
 If the past is any indication, more deals are likely soon. More than $3.2 trillion worth of mergers and acquisitions have been announced around the world so far this year, compared with $2.4 trillion in 2005, according to Dealogic.

NEXT UP? A day after the popular editor of The Los Angeles Times stepped down rather than make further money-saving cuts to his staff, two Los Angeles billionaires, Eli Broad and Ronald W. Burkle, jointly offered to buy the newspaper -- and the nationwide media corporation that owns it.
 Details of the bid were not made public, but the target, the Tribune Company, has a market capitalization of almost $8 billion. In addition to The Los Angeles Times -- its biggest property and the nation's fourth-largest newspaper -- the company, which is based in Chicago, also owns 10 other daily newspapers, more than two dozen television stations and the Chicago Cubs.
 Losing the editor, Dean Baquet, was seen by some people in Los Angeles as a sign that Tribune was willing to sacrifice the paper's quality for bigger profits. It certainly was indicative of tumult in the industry, coming just a day before Amanda Bennett was forced out as editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer.
 A third Los Angeles billionaire, the film and music mogul David Geffen, may make his own bid for the Los Angeles newspaper.

SURE WINNERS -- Whether all of these deals eventually work out for the buyers, they have already produced big gains for the investment bankers who are arranging the transactions.
 Annual bonuses on Wall Street this year are forecast to rise 10 to 15 percent from 2005, according to Alan Johnson Associates, an executive compensation consultant. Investment bankers, who advise corporations on mergers and financing, are expected to experience the biggest percentage jump, about 20 to 25 percent this year.
 Traders, who invest their firms' own capital, will make even more, as much as $40 million to $50 million, Wall Street executives say.
 Abundant global capital and rapid international growth will keep salaries and bonuses high for years, analysts said.

THE BAD NEWS -- Flush times for traders, however, does not necessarily mean as much for the people who execute trades for them. The New York Stock Exchange said it would cut more than 500 jobs, or 17 percent of its staff, from now to next March.
 The exchange, which is moving toward more electronic trading, recently said it would close one of its five trading floors in downtown Manhattan as part of that shift. Coincidentally, the exchange, which became a public company in March, is seeking to reduce its overhead costs by $200 million.
 Analysts expect more cuts, saying the Big Board has excess staff, compared with its rivals.

TOO LATE -- Citing production delays dogging the Airbus double-deck A380 airliner, the FedEx Corporation canceled its order for 10 cargo versions of the huge aircraft and in their place ordered 15 Boeing 777 freighters and took options on 15 more.
 Airbus recently said problems with wiring and other production processes would delay the delivery of A380's by as much as two years, twice as long as initial estimates. FedEx is the only customer so far to cancel an order for the giant aircraft.
 Airbus representatives are canvassing other customers to see whether they, too, are considering canceling orders, and how to dissuade them from doing so.

TOO SLOW -- Amid criticism that he has been too slow to curb labor costs by cutting jobs and extending the typical employee's workweek, Bernd Pischetsrieder was forced out as chief executive of Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker.
 Although VW's board extended Mr. Pischetsrieder's contract for five years just last May, the chairman, Ferdinand K. Piech, remained hostile to Mr. Pischetsrieder, saying he had lost the support of employees.
 Volkswagen's board will meet on Friday to choose Mr. Pischetsrieder's successor. Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive of VW's Audi division, is the leading candidate.

BRIGHT SPOT -- While much of the world's automobile industry struggles with falling sales or mounting losses, Toyota said its profit surged more than 33 percent in the three months through September, driven by strong sales in the United States and Europe.
 In the quarter, Toyota said it made a profit of $3.4 billion, compared with $2.6 billion in the period last year. The company raised its profit forecast for the full year to more than $13 billion, up from about $11 billion a year earlier.
 Toyota plans to increase production outside of Japan by 40 percent, to five million vehicles, by 2008 as it tries to top General Motors as the world's largest automaker.

HEADLINE: Russia Near Deal to Join The W.T.O. 

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER and EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Andrew E. Kramer reported from Moscow and Edmund L. Andrews from Washington.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Officials in Washington and Moscow reached an agreement in principle for Russia to join the World Trade Organization, crossing the final big hurdle in the stop-and-go cycle that has marked the process since Moscow began its application shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
 The deal is expected to be signed next Saturday, when both President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia will be in Hanoi for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, negotiators from both countries said. The White House also announced this week that President Bush planned to stop in Moscow on Nov. 15 on his way to Vietnam. 
''We have agreement in principle and are finalizing the details,'' the United States trade representative, Susan Schwab, said in a statement. ''It is a clear indication of Russia's efforts to participate fully in and benefit from the rules-based global trading system.'' 
 Mr. Putin has repeatedly said that joining the 149-member W.T.O. was a major foreign policy goal, though Russia's oil-driven economy will get few direct gains from membership in the organization, which sets the ground rules for globalization. But joining would give Russia a voice in world trade talks, with the potential to help set future trade policy. 
 ''Russia today is the only major world economy outside the W.T.O. -- the only one,'' Mr. Putin said at a news conference early in his presidency, in June 2002. ''Staying outside this organization, outside this process is dangerous and stupid.''
 American officials say the countries gradually worked out nagging disputes on issues like agriculture inspections, chicken exports to Russia and intellectual property protection. 
 The Bush administration has other contentious issues with Russia, particularly its support for Iran and that country's nuclear program. There was no immediate sign of any broader deal involving those issues.
 One American official said that Russian negotiators had been a ''moving target'' back in July, balking on issues that Washington thought had been resolved. But they said Russian officials had become more forthcoming in recent weeks. 
 ''At the bitter end, the issues were quite trivial,'' said Gary C. Hufbauer, a trade policy expert at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, who has followed the negotiations. 
 Mr. Hufbauer suggested that Russian leaders might have decided to seal a deal out of worry that this week's elections would mean greater resistance by Democrats to an accord. ''I think the Russians read the election returns and realized that if they don't go for it now, they might not get anything,'' he said.
 Russia still must win approval from Moldova and Georgia, countries with deep grievances over a Russian ban on importing wine, ostensibly for health reasons. Those countries could further delay any final deal on W.T.O. membership, which is expected to take place next year. Russian officials have said they want to join in 2007. 
 Georgia first approved Russia's membership but rescinded it last month, after Russia blockaded its border. Maksim Medvedkov, Russia's chief negotiator, said Friday in remarks carried on state television that he would not negotiate with Moldova and Georgia separately but try to allay their objections during multilateral talks with the W.T.O. in Geneva.
 The European Union, China and Japan have already signed off on Russian membership. 
 American officials said they reached agreement on longstanding disputes about American exports of poultry, beef and pork. Russia is the United States' biggest export market for chicken parts, but American producers have long complained about being hindered by Russian inspection procedures.
 The agreement also calls for Russia to offer greater access for foreign services, from construction to overnight parcel delivery and telecommunications. Russian officials also agreed to allow banks and investment firms in Russia to be owned by foreign companies, meaning that foreign banks would not need to team up with Russian partners.
 American trade negotiators accepted an unusual restriction on foreign players in the banking and insurance sectors, according to the trade representative office. It will limit foreign investment to no greater than 50 percent of total investments in these businesses. In Moscow, state television reported Friday that Russia was the only country in the W.T.O. to win this concession. 
 Russia also promised to step up enforcement of intellectual property rights, which had been carried out in spotty fashion.
 Russian trade relations with the United States, while forming only a tiny share of both countries' total foreign trade, have gone through some dismal periods. In 2002, President Bush imposed tariffs on steel, a major Russian export commodity, and Mr. Putin retaliated by banning imports of chicken thighs, known as ''Bush Legs'' because the product first arrived in Russia as food aid under the president's father in the early 1990s. 
 In contrast to China, Russia's oil-dependent economy gains little from joining the W.T.O. ''China is a consumer goods manufacturer and exporter and there was a huge benefit for China,'' said Peter Westin, chief economist at the MDM Bank. ''There will be nothing like that for Russia.''
 Instead, Mr. Westin and other economists say, the primary benefit for Russia would come in exposing the domestic banking, telecommunications and other sectors to more direct foreign competition. This should increase productivity.
 Ford Motor, which produces about 70,000 cars a year in Russia and exports another 50,000 cars to Russia, said it was delighted by the deal. Over the next seven years, Russian duties on foreign-made cars are set to decline to 15 percent, from 25 percent today. 
 ''What all this adds up to,'' said Stephen E. Biegun, Ford's vice president for international governmental affairs, ''is that we will be able to grow as fast as we possibly can in Russia.''

HEADLINE: Was It a Victory for the Moderates?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 David Brooks observes the smoking ruins of Republican Congressional rule and sees a resounding defeat for the left (''The Middle Muscles In,'' column, Nov. 9).
He argues that voters didn't swing left, but instead ''exchanged moderate Republicans for conservative Democrats.'' 
 To succeed in power, he says, Democrats must demonstrate independence from ''economic nationalists'' and progressive bloggers. 
 The problem with Mr. Brooks's analysis is that the same socially conservative Democratic candidates whose victories he celebrates -- Heath Shuler, Brad Ellsworth and Jim Webb -- offered an unabashedly progressive economic message. 
 They railed against outsourcing and Republican sops to big business, and they were echoed by Democrats nationwide. 
 Representative-elect Ellsworth: ''Bad trade agreements and corporate giveaways are just sweetheart deals for big corporations that don't need them. ''
 Democrats campaigned against two Republican wars: Iraq and the war on the American working class. On the key issues in the election, Democrats moved left and won big. 

Scott Nova
Washington, Nov. 9, 2006

To the Editor:
 David Brooks's observations about America's newly ''muscular middle'' were spot on, and no one said it better than the president's mother.
 Barbara Bush, at the 1992 Republican convention, when her husband, George H. W. Bush, was president, said in an interview that the hardest job in politics is motivating a moderate. She added, I know because George has been trying to for 40 years. 
 She went on to note (and I am paraphrasing here) that if folks thought that their party was veering too far to the right or the left, they needed to get out and do the hard but vital work (including voting) that the more zealous or committed among us are wont to do anyway. 
 Though the change on Tuesday was hardly convulsive, it does appear that the moderates have finally been motivated and the altered political landscape bodes well for all of us, Republican and Democrat alike.

Anna Perez
Mill Valley, Calif., Nov. 9, 2006

The writer was Barbara Bush's press secretary from 1989 to 1993.

To the Editor:
 David Brooks is correct. Polls show that much of the country is dissatisfied with the obstinate stance of the Bush administration as well as with politicians like Senators Rick Santorum and George Allen. 
 I also believe that there is no appetite for the politics of the ''hard left.'' 
 I hope that Senator Harry Reid and Representative Nancy Pelosi understand this as well. There is a great opportunity to heal the wounds of divisiveness and to produce legislation that would benefit the country. 

Martin B. Freedland
Atlanta, Nov. 9, 2006

To the Editor:
 As a former Republican mayor of Fort Wayne, Ind., and the new president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, I have long considered myself a ''moderate'' and welcome David Brooks's comments.
 But Mr. Brooks, by using labels like ''pro-gun Democrats'' to describe candidates like Jim Webb, falls back into one of the good-bad traps of political discourse he criticizes.
 Concerns for gun violence prevention and public safety should not be categorized as pro-gun versus anti-gun.
 What's ''anti-gun'' about wanting background checks to make sure that those with criminal records aren't buying guns legally? What's ''anti-gun'' about restricting bulk sales of handguns, a sure sign that someone wants to sell those guns illegally on the secondary market?
 Why isn't it ''pro-gun'' to want to crack down on the 1 percent of gun dealers who sell 57 percent of the guns that end up being used illegally; or to support more financing for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives? 
 When a candidate says he wants to enforce ''the gun laws on the books,'' why don't we see that as being opposed to the gun lobby's efforts to weaken ''the laws on the books''?
 I came to the Brady Campaign to bring a common-sense, ''moderate'' approach to reducing the gun violence that is too prevalent in our communities. This is where most Americans seem to be on the issue.

Paul Helmke
Washington, Nov. 9, 2006

To the Editor:
 David Brooks can use whatever adjectives he wants to describe them, spin their victories however he chooses, and theorize about what they will do in office, but the bottom line does not change. 
 They are Democrats. Happy days are here again!

HEADLINE: Ortega, Again

 BODY:
Nicaragua's top Sandinista is back -- and with him international anxiety. Daniel Ortega won the presidency of Nicaragua on Sunday, raising fears that Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro now have another faithful acolyte. 
 But while Mr. Ortega's election is bad news, it is not because he is still a Marxist revolutionary. He is an old-style Latin American strongman who, we fear, will further weaken Nicaragua's democratic institutions and retard economic progress. Washington's challenge will be to figure out how to help curb Mr. Ortega's authoritarian impulses without pushing him into Mr. Chavez's arms.
Mr. Ortega, who was voted out of power in 1990, won this time because his opponents could not agree on a single candidate. The 39 percent of the country that voted for him was yearning for any change that could dig the country out of its deep poverty. He still had to use a series of political maneuvers and dirty tricks to ensure his victory. 
 As leader of the Sandinistas in the late 1990s, he made Nicaragua ungovernable by sending protesters into the streets. In return for peace, Arnoldo Aleman, the president then, allowed Mr. Ortega to pack the Supreme Court and the election commission, and arranged for both Mr. Ortega and himself to be granted lifetime legal immunity. That allowed Mr. Ortega to escape prosecution after his stepdaughter accused him of sexual abuse, beginning when she was 11. (Since stripped of his immunity, Mr. Aleman is serving 20 years for embezzlement.)
 Mr. Aleman also agreed to lower the threshold of votes required to win a first-round election -- upping the chances of an Ortega victory.
 In his last pre-election act of cynicism, Mr. Ortega neutralized the powerful Catholic Church's opposition by backing passage of a bill that criminalizes all abortion. Mr. Ortega was once pro-Marxist, but now he's pro-Ortega. And that's the problem.

HEADLINE: Treasury Chief Set to Seek Deals

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
For his first months in office, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. kept to the shadows while cabinet colleagues were campaigning for a Republican Congress. He made it plain that he disliked politicking, and he irritated some Republicans the Friday before Election Day by not joining the administration chorus talking up a drop in the jobless rate.
 But now the new Treasury chief is set to plunge in. Untainted by the harshly partisan rhetoric of the past, he hopes to use his prowess as the former head of Goldman Sachs not just to pursue critical economic deals with China and other American trading partners but -- equally important for the weakened administration -- to explore deal-making with Democrats in Congress, as well.
 An objective is to restore the long-term financial stability of Social Security and Medicare as baby boomers head toward retirement. 
 While that may prove politically impossible, in the short term Mr. Paulson is also expected to be at the center of efforts to find economic issues on which Congressional Democrats and the Bush administration can agree next year. 
 Lawmakers in both parties say talks may include middle-class tax breaks and simplification of the tax code. Democrats, for their part, hope to use Mr. Paulson's comments this summer, in which he deplored income inequality, to press for a minimum wage increase. 
 The White House says it is counting on the best from Mr. Paulson. But the chances for real cooperation are limited. 
 Mr. Paulson could easily run up against hard-liners in the administration who are likely to doubt that negotiation with the Democrats is the best course for Republicans already looking ahead to the 2008 elections. And while there is much talk in Washington of finding common ground after the vitriolic campaign, the mood could sour as early as next week when Congress returns for a lame-duck session where Republicans will still be in control.
 ''I have every reason to believe that Paulson will have some influence with the president,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the expected Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. ''The question is how much.''
 The day after the Democratic victory in the midterm elections, President Bush announced that he asked Mr. Paulson ''to reach out to folks on the Hill'' on Social Security and Medicare, subjects that inevitably will lead to discussions about taxes and spending.
 ''With the election over, there may be an opportunity for some renaissance of bipartisanship,'' said Joshua B. Bolten, the White House chief of staff. ''Hank Paulson is an important ingredient in that chemistry.''
 In an interview after the voting this week, Mr. Paulson said he was determined to work with Democrats to get something done next year.
 ''It has always been my view, even before the election, that on the major issues this country is facing, any solution was going to have to take a bipartisan approach,'' he said. ''We were going to have to build a consensus, no matter who won the election.''
 Mr. Paulson is a professed neophyte in political and legislative warfare, but is recognized as a master at striking bargains in the business world. As chief executive of Goldman Sachs he made billions of dollars in investment banking deals in the United States, as well as in China, Germany and other countries.
 ''I don't think you'll find anybody as tenacious as he is,'' said John F. W. Rogers, a managing director at Goldman Sachs who served for a time as Mr. Paulson's chief of staff there. He added that it was instructive to go hiking with Mr. Paulson, an avid outdoorsman whose environmental views are not always in sync with the administration's.
 ''It's like a forced march,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''If he sees a downed tree, he says, 'You can go over it, you can go under it, but you can't go around it.' There's an active sense of attacking problems head-on.''
 He has already delved into the issues presented by China. Mr. Paulson plans to lead an unusual delegation to China in December that will include at least a half-dozen cabinet colleagues dealing with issues like commerce, trade, energy and transportation. The trip underscores his first-among-equals status in the cabinet when it comes to economic matters.
 For all his business experience, though, others who know Mr. Paulson say that he may have trouble navigating the egos and competing interests on Capitol Hill as well as those inside the administration.
 Beginning to address government benefit programs could be an early test of Mr. Paulson's leadership and negotiating skills. The Treasury chief has repeatedly asserted that he wants to fix Social Security and Medicare, which are set to rise sharply in cost in the coming years, and to work with Democrats on solutions. 
 But Democrats say that if the Treasury chief revives Mr. Bush's emphasis on private investment accounts, as a partial replacement for Social Security for future retirees, it will be rejected -- and seen as an act of bad faith.
 ''I once told President Bush that if he took private accounts off the table, I would go around the country with him in support of Social Security reforms,'' Mr. Rangel recalled. ''He said, 'As long as I'm president, private accounts will be on the table.' Well, if he says that now, he's basically saying he doesn't want a deal on Social Security.''
 Mr. Bush said a couple of weeks ago that he would continue to push for private investment accounts. But the president also said that he would retain Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, only to reverse himself this week.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who will lose his position as chairman of the Finance Committee next year, said it appeared that Mr. Paulson was already advocating more efforts to listen to Congress. But it was not clear whether he could persuade Vice President Dick Cheney or Karl Rove, the political strategist, to go along.
 ''I don't know whether he's going to win or lose,'' Mr. Grassley said, ''but I sure applaud what he's doing.''
 In recent weeks, the Treasury secretary has spent a lot of time courting lawmakers like Mr. Rangel, who will be at the center of any discussion of taxes and benefit programs, and Senator Max Baucus of Montana, his counterpart as the expected chairman of the Finance Committee.
 ''I'm very impressed,'' Mr. Baucus said. ''Hank Paulson seems to have very few ideological bones in his body.''
 But there is also precedent to consider or -- possibly for this president -- to avoid. Mr. Bush's father, President George H. W. Bush, negotiated a grand budget and tax deal with Congress in 1990, only to have it shot down by Republicans in the House because it contemplated some tax increases. (Later that year, after a temporary government shutdown, lawmakers finally approved a budget that included limited tax increases.)
 That budget deal remains a source of bitterness among conservatives. Some argued that it was an excellent model for cooperation -- in that Democrats accepted some spending cuts -- and helped usher in economic growth in the 1990s. But it also involved Mr. Bush's going back on his ''read my lips: no new taxes'' pledge in the 1988 presidential campaign.
 If there are marathon negotiations to resolve tax and budget issues, an administration official said, they would not take place at Andrews Air Force Base, the scene of the 1990 talks.
 Taking over as Treasury chief this summer, Mr. Paulson has surrounded himself with an eclectic team. The only top official he has brought from his time at GoldmanSachs is Robert K. Steel, now the under secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance.
 His chief of staff and top political aide is James Wilkinson, a veteran of Texas politics who has served as a top aide to Mr. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
 The environment in Congress on budget and tax issues will be tricky, because Democrats are loath to begin the discussion of increasing any taxes, having been accused by Republicans of being a bunch of tax raisers in the last election. 
 But Democrats all say they embrace enactment of a ''pay as you go'' regime in which any future tax cuts or spending increases will have to be paid for by spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere. While few insiders expect major changes to Mr. Bush's big tax cuts until after the 2008 election, the subject of increasing some taxes, or scaling back past tax cuts, may end up on the table next year.
 Democrats, however, are determined to increase the minimum wage, now $5.15 an hour, to $7 or more. Mr. Paulson has not taken any stand on whether he would favor such an increase. 
 Mr. Paulson has declared that his other economic priorities are to combat protectionist sentiment in the United States and to engage in a widespread dialogue with China that could eventually prod the Chinese leadership to overhaul their nation's economic practices.
 Mr. Paulson succeeded in persuading Mr. Bush to let him head an inter-agency committee of cabinet members on dealing with China. He did so by lining up support among the cabinet members and the White House staff first.
 The mid-December trip is aimed at persuading the Chinese to liberalize their economy, crack down on piracy, discuss future cooperation on energy and encourage greater flexibility in currency practices.
 Mr. Paulson is to be accompanied by Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative; Carlos M. Gutierrez, the commerce secretary; and Samuel W. Bodman, the energy secretary. Treasury officials say they would like quick progress on China's practice of keeping its currency artificially low in relation to the dollar, which aggravates the trade imbalance by making exports to America cheaper and imports to China more expensive. But many experts say the Chinese are resisting out of concern that such a step could damage their banking system, throwing people out of work.
 Mr. Paulson will be raising the pressure on China, but political experts say his skills have mostly revealed themselves so far in getting United States lawmakers to withdraw a bill punishing China if it does not change its currency policy.
 The Treasury secretary also hopes to help Ms. Schwab get a global trade deal that could be approved by Congress next year. But the consensus among Congressional leaders is that it is probably too late for that.
 Beyond a possible breakthrough with China, they say that Mr. Paulson's greatest hope for success lies in striking smaller bargains on the budget and taxes. Mr. Rangel and Mr. Baucus said it would be better to reach agreements on incremental tax issues first to build up trust.
 Mr. Paulson, in the interview, also said he thought that the approach of reaching for ''low-hanging fruit'' on economic issues might make sense.
 ''I'm hoping there will be some things that we can get some quick victories on,'' Mr. Paulson said. ''Then if we can get some things done, it will be a good basis for going on to more difficult issues.''

HEADLINE: Blair Says Homegrown Terrorism Is Generation-Long Struggle

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair said Friday that the threat from homegrown Islamic terrorism would last ''a generation,'' reinforcing a highly unusual warning by the head of the MI5 domestic intelligence agency that it was keeping some 1,600 suspects in 200 terrorist cells under surveillance.
 The warning by Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller, head of MI5, in a speech on Thursday was by far the most extensive and somber of recent times and included assertions that about 30 terrorist conspiracies were under investigation and that ''tomorrow's threat may include the use of chemicals, bacteriological agents, radioactive materials and even nuclear technology.'' 
She also asserted that operatives for Al Qaeda in Pakistan were helping to guide some of the plots, reflecting British assessments that Qaeda operatives survived campaigns against them to steer conspiracies in Britain from afar. 
 ''We are aware of numerous plots to kill people and to damage our economy,'' she said. ''What do I mean by numerous? Five? Ten? No, Nearer 30 -- that we know of. These plots often have links back to Al Qaeda in Pakistan and through those links, Al Qaeda gives guidance and training to its largely British foot soldiers here on an extensive and growing scale.''
 The British counterterrorism authorities say they cannot move too quickly to break up plots because they need enough evidence to prosecute suspects successfully. 
 Since the London bombings of July 2005, Britain has sounded frequent terrorist alarms, most notably last August when it issued a major alert alleging that Islamic terrorists planned to blow up trans-Atlantic airliners. And just this week, a judge sentenced a 34-year-old Muslim, Dhiren Barot, to a minimum of 40 years in prison for plotting a series of attacks in the United States and Britain from 2000 to 2004.
 The news and warnings have left many Britons with mixed feelings: a sense of foreboding, but also some skepticism about the government's motives in making such announcements since there have been no attacks for more than a year. 
 Among the more frightening aspects of Dame Eliza's warning was her statement that support for terrorism among British Muslims was broader than previously known, as more young people had become radicalized. 
 ''More and more people are moving from passive sympathy toward active terrorism through being radicalized or indoctrinated by friends, families, in organized training events here and overseas, by images on television, through chat rooms and Web sites on the Internet,'' she said.
 Moreover, Dame Eliza said, since the July 2005 subway and bus attacks, five other ''major conspiracies'' had been thwarted in Britain, ''saving many hundreds, possibly even thousands, of lives.'' MI5's caseload has increased 80 percent so far this year alone, she said.
 Historically, the head of MI5 does not make such public pronouncements. ''Emerging from the shadows is not something they like to do,'' said Neil Ellis, a domestic security expert at Royal United Services Institute, a research group. Indeed, Dame Eliza acknowledged in her speech to academics on Thursday night: ''I rarely speak in public. I prefer to avoid the limelight and get on with my job.''
 But it was a sign of changed times -- and, perhaps of MI5's campaign to secure more government money and expand its ranks of agents and recruits -- that the text of her speech was posted Friday on the MI5 Web site, prompting some Islamic leaders to say the authorities were demonizing Britain's Muslim minority of 1.6 million. 
 Massoud Shadjareh, the chairman of the Islamic Human Rights Commission, said, ''Although we recognize that there is a real threat, the suggestion that we could even face a nuclear threat will only contribute to paranoia rather than safety and security.''
 Dame Eliza echoed some longstanding arguments by Mr. Blair, who has resisted critics' accusations that his support of the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan had made Britain a target for terrorist attack. ''Let there be no doubt about this,'' she said, ''the international terrorist threat to this country is not new. It began before Iraq, before Afghanistan and before 9/11.''
 But she went on to say that terrorist recruiters had woven a ''powerful narrative'' of Muslim oppression. She said the video wills of British suicide bombers made it clear that they were motivated, in part, by their interpretation of British foreign policy, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, as anti-Muslim, but also by perceived worldwide and longstanding injustices against Muslims and an ''extreme and minority interpretation of Islam promoted by some preachers and people of influence.''
 She said the terrorist threat was ''serious, is growing and will, I believe, be with us for a generation.'' 
 ''It is a sustained campaign, not a series of isolated incidents,'' she continued. ''It aims to wear down our will to resist.''
 In a separate news conference on Friday, Mr. Blair said, ''I think it's absolutely right that it will last a generation.''
 ''It's a very long and deep struggle,'' he said, ''but we have to stand up and be counted for what we believe in and take the fight to those people who want to entice young people into something wicked and violent but utterly futile.''
 Dame Eliza has presided over a major, public effort to expand MI5, which deals exclusively with domestic security and espionage. In her speech, she said the MI5 staff now numbers 2,800, ''an increase of over 50 percent since 9/11.'' 
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Ellis, of the Royal United Services Institute, said there had been a series of public statements by British officials warning of an increasing threat and seeking public support. Just on Wednesday, for instance, the foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, urged British Muslims to ''speak up against extremism.'' 
 From that point of view, Mr. Ellis said, Dame Eliza may have been trying to promote this ''cultural shift in how the security services engage with the public.'' 
 ''If society is to engage in this battle of ideas,'' Mr. Ellis said, ''then perhaps we need to know the level, the size and the scale of this threat.''

HEADLINE: Military Team Undertakes a Broad Review of the Iraq War and the Campaign Against Terror

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Senior military leaders have begun a broad review of strategy in Iraq and other crisis areas in the Bush administration's campaign against terrorism, according to Pentagon officials. 
 In a closely held effort, Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has assembled a team of some of the military's brightest and most innovative officers and told them to take a fresh look at Iraq and Afghanistan, among other flashpoints.
Pentagon officials said that the team's objective was to outline a range of options that General Pace might draw on in advising President Bush and Robert M. Gates, selected by Mr. Bush to become defense secretary, as the White House adjusts its strategy in Iraq. Ideas that have been discussed include increasing the size of the Iraqi security forces, along with the American effort to train and equip them, and adjusting the size of the American force in Iraq. 
 But Pentagon officials stressed that the review extended well beyond Iraq, and that some unorthodox ideas on how to fight terrorism were being weighed. The review reflects the recognition that military efforts need to be part of an overall approach that includes all aspects of American power, including diplomatic and economic.
 Pentagon officials said the military review, which formally began Sept. 25, is being coordinated with the rest of the government, but that the military team had not met with members of the Iraq Study Group, the commission that is also looking into options for Iraq. The creation of that commission, headed by a former secretary of state, James A. Baker III, and Lee H. Hamilton, a former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, had raised the possibility that fundamental decisions on how to proceed in Iraq might be determined largely outside of the Pentagon. The commission is being advised by former military officers, but none of its members have served as senior military commanders. 
 The team involved in the military review includes Col. H. R. McMaster, the Army officer whose 2005 operation in Tal Afar has been cited as a textbook case in how to wage counterinsurgency in Iraq. 
 Other military officers include Col. Peter R. Mansoor, the director of the United States Army and Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., who previously commanded an Army brigade that fought the Mahdi Army militia in 2004 at Karbala. 
 Col. Thomas C. Greenwood, the director of the Marine Command and Staff College, who oversaw efforts to train Iraqi security forces in Anbar, the restive province in western Iraq, is also on the team. All told, more than a dozen military officers are on the team, which is overseen by Capt. Michael Rogers of the Navy, who serves as a special assistant to General Pace. 
 Though the review has been under way for six weeks, it has acquired special urgency as a result of the Democratic gains in the election, President Bush's decision to replace Donald H. Rumsfeld as defense secretary and the clamor for some kind of course adjustment in Iraq. 
 The goal is to finish the review in December, but some of its interim thinking has been made available to the military chiefs, Pentagon officials said. 
 Initially, the Pentagon tried to keep the existence of the review secret. But in recent days the Bush administration has advertised its willingness to consider fresh approaches in an effort to counter criticism that it was rigidly adhering to a faltering strategy. General Pace referred to the review in general terms in TV appearances today. 
 ''We have to give ourselves a good honest scrub about what is working and what is not working, what are the impediments to progress and what should we change about the way we are doing it to make sure that we get to the objective that we set for ourselves,'' General Pace said in an interview with CBS. ''I am looking at it with the Joint Chiefs. We're making our recommendations. We're having our dialogue.''
 General Pace said that Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the top commander in Iraq, and General John P. Abizaid, the head of the United States Central Command, were part of the effort. 
 Mr. Bush is to meet Monday with the commission headed by Mr. Baker and Mr. Hamilton. Others who will meet with the group are Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice; Mr. Rumsfeld; the national intelligence director, John D. Negroponte; Gen. Michael V. Hayden, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency; and Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador to Iraq. The study group is expected to issue its recommendations around Dec. 7.

HEADLINE: McGraw-Hill Looks East, And Upward 

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
The McGraw-Hill Companies was stagnating in 1993 when Harold McGraw III, great-grandson of the founder, took over. Despite employees' whispered jokes about bringing in le dauphin, the company's stock has risen 730 percent since then, closing yesterday at $64.20.
 To prove the doubters wrong, Mr. McGraw, known as Terry, started to dump dozens of magazines and newsletters, keeping BusinessWeek and Architectural Record, among others. 
 He was interviewed this week in his New York office atop the McGraw-Hill Building on the Avenue of the Americas, in one of the most sumptuous chief executive's offices around: dark wood paneling, oriental rugs and a huge, bare and glossy mahogany conference table. Following are excerpts:

Q. One of the most recent news stories about McGraw-Hill concerned a rumor that you might be bidding for Bloomberg L.P. Was that true?

A. I have no idea where that story came from. We can only assume someone thought of it because we're both information companies. We know that company really well; we have personal friends there. We sell information products on their system. Bloomberg's a great company but that's as far as it goes. Anyway, I don't think Mike Bloomberg wants to sell.

Q. Are you looking for companies to buy?

A. We always are. We have a lot of free cash flow, and it's a balancing act how to treat it. You can increase dividends, make share purchases or make acquisitions? Prior to this year, we returned over $5.5 billion to the shareholders since 1996, $1.5 billion of it so far this year. We think that's pretty good.

Q. What are the hottest areas of growth for the company?

A. Within the last year, we've continued to focus on the real growth drivers: global, digital and productivity. We're growing so fast. We moved out of the United States in the late 1980s and we are now in 38 countries, with 300 offices.

Q. Where is the most exciting place?

A. India. India's a country that started liberalizing in the early '90s, when it was still obstructionist and protectionist, still breaking away from the Nehru era. Under the new coalition government, they have turned into a globally responsible player. Two and a half, three years ago we had 250 employees there; today we have 3,000 -- and these are real employees, not offshore projects, we broker all those. And we will continue to expand there. China is still a very controlled economy; liberation is imperative for them.

Q. What do you see as McGraw-Hill's biggest growth patterns?

A. We're 33, 34 years into a 75-year trend toward global capital markets. We have a company, Standard & Poor's, that helps investors assess capital markets. Investors need some quality benchmarks. We have three main segments: information and media, education and financial. In information and media, we've worked away from our advertising base, into online. Platts was an all-print operation. Now it's an 24/7 energy and metals and petrochemicals information source. We set the markets. We set the prices. We have J. D. Power and we have a construction group. In terms of future growth, we say all roads go online, all roads go to Asia.

Q. At 58, you're probably too young to think of a successor, but if you were, would you look for someone in the family?

A. I would love a family member. But this is a public company and it has to be run as a public company. Performance counts 100 percent.

Q. When you first came in, weren't you perceived as, well, hard-nosed?

A. I don't like to think of it that way. I say I am 100 percent selfish for the company; once you let complacency creep in, you're going to lose the really talented people.

Q. Yes, wasn't McGraw-Hill once perceived as one of those old-fashioned, somewhat complacent companies?

A. For sure. When I took over as president, we weren't performing as well as we should have been. Some people had been here a long time, wonderful people, but in terms of performance, the culture had to become tougher. There was always a feeling that if you performed reasonably well you were here for life. Today, change is pervasive. We're thinking now about how to create a better R&D center. You cut back R&D at your peril.

Q. What about the stock price?

A. Up is good.

In terms of future growth, we say all roads go online, all roads go to Asia.
 Q. We don't hear about many $6 billion companies that are being run by the original founder's family members. Can you tell me a little about your background?
 A. (Laughs) I come from a great family. I went to Tufts University and I started work in broadcasting, in business, in advertising, even a little bit of on-air. I went to Wharton and then I worked at GTE in corporate finance for six years. There I began to see, in the 70's, huge changes in management's role, in pension fund systems. In 1979, American Express began a hostile takeover attempt at McGraw-Hill. I took a three-month leave of absence from GTE -- that was a time I had not expected to come back and work at the company. We were successful in repelling the takeover attempt, but I saw how involved the employees were, and about a year later, I did come back. I started off with the pension fund -- I probably gave some concern to a few people around here -- ''oh, what's he going to do to our pension?'' -- but now we are one of only 52 fully -funded pension systems in the S & P 500. And we haven't made a contribution in a long time, the returns have been so terrific.
 Q: Then what happened with your career?
 A: I became publisher of Aviation Week & Space Technology -- we still own it -- before going downtown to Standard & Poor's, and then became executive vice -president of operations; in 1993, I took over as president and chief operating officer.
 Q: Who else in the family works here?
 A: I have a cousin, Jay, who runs McGraw-Hill Construction and my brother Bob is on the board.
 Q. At 58, you're probably too young to think of a successor, but if you were, would you look for someone in the family?
 A. I would love a family member. But this is a public company and it has to be run as a public company. Performance counts 100 percent.

HEADLINE: ART

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:

The Neue Galerie may be the first place in Manhattan that comes to mind when the itch strikes to see works by German artists. But just a few blocks away, the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART will be showing ''GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s.'' 


On view starting Tuesday will be 40 paintings and 60 works on paper by 10 artists: Max Beckmann, Heinrich Maria Davringhausen, Otto Dix, George Grosz, Karl Hubbuch, Ludwig Meidner, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter, Georg Scholz and Gert H. Wollheim.

These artists, who visually recorded the rampant unemployment, hyperinflation and social panic besetting German cities like Berlin, Dusseldorf and Dresden just after World War I, found subjects who represented all walks of life, epitomizing the extremes of the era, from cabaret dancers and wounded soldiers to wealthy bankers, military men and priests. Through Feb. 19, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org.

By contrast, all week Christie's, Sotheby's and Phillips de Pury & Company will be showing an embarrassing wealth of contemporary art up for sale day and night, beginning Tuesday at Sotheby's. Blue-chip artists like WARHOL and DE KOONING head an all-star list. At Sotheby's there is a collection of 90 paintings and sculptures from Roger and Josette Vanthournout, relatively unknown Belgian collectors. By far the most important of the works, which include examples by Damien Hirst, Lichtenstein, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Gerhard Richter and Carl Andre, is a 1968 FRANCIS BACON, ''VERSION NO. 2 OF LYING FIGURE WITH HYPODERMIC SYRINGE,'' in which Bacon took one of the most familiar subjects in art -- the reclining female nude -- and painted it as a tortured soul, as he painted many things. It is expected to sell for $9 million to $12 million.

Christie's has several important Warhols for sale, including the familiar portrait of Chairman Mao. Considered by experts to be one of best examples of Warhol's Mao paintings, this one measures 82 by 61 inches, and is expected to sell for $8 million to $12 million. It is being sold by the Daros Collection in Zurich.

HEADLINE: Maybe You Did Vote Your Pocketbook 

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
SOMEWHERE, deep in the consciousness of American voters, is the idea that the representatives they send to Washington can affect their economic well-being. Candidates surely share this conviction. Otherwise, why would they bother to make promises about jobs, incomes and taxes?
 It follows that if those representatives fail to bring economic benefits, they risk losing their own jobs. So politics affects economics, and vice versa -- at least that's the widely held theory. But what was the reality in last week's election? 
To paraphrase a Clinton-era mantra, it really might have been the economy, stupid. More than 80 percent of voters in an exit poll, conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Media Research/Mitofsky International, said the economy was a very important or extremely important issue. That percentage was the highest for any issue, including Iraq and terrorism. 
 Furthermore, electoral data and government economic statistics suggest that the economy played a role in the outcome: if your state wasn't among the best economic performers in the last six years, judged by the growth of personal income, it appears that you were three times as likely to vote to throw the bums out.
 That's the conclusion from an early look at the figures, and it may even be true. But the actual relationships between politics and economics are hard to pin down empirically, and some experts may even theorize that they don't exist. 
 Plenty of economists would argue, for example, that your local representative doesn't really have much control over your economic well-being. In the long run, the nation's capacity to produce is controlled by factors like educational attainment and the development of new technologies -- factors that are difficult to change in a short period. 
 Moreover, your representative can't do much, as an individual, to sway the world economy. The amount of your state's exports demanded by Europe, Japan and other economic giants relies on millions of other dynamics, even though your representative may take the occasional rainmaking trip abroad.
 Then there is pork-barreling. As a member of the ruling party in Congress -- the Republicans, in recent times -- your representative might have been able to funnel federal construction money your way, or perhaps to add a few pet projects in your district to assorted spending bills. In addition, your representative might have contributed to writing big legislation, like tax cuts, so that it favored people like you.
 Yet something like pork-barreling could have a measurable economic impact at the local level, even if its effects are dwarfed by those of globalization. And the data suggest that voting for Republicans in 2000 did help some states economically. In general, personal income rose faster from the end of 2000 through the second quarter this year in states that elected a higher share of Republicans to their House delegations. On average, states that elected no Republicans to the House could have expected nine percentage points less growth in personal income than states that elected all Republicans. The average state's income grew by 29 percent, so an additional nine points wouldn't have been anything to sneeze at. During that same six-year period, the states' economic experiences were hardly uniform. In rural states like Wyoming and South Dakota, for example, personal income rose by well over a third. In other states, like Michigan and Ohio, it grew less than a fifth. So there is a logical next question: Did voters hold their agenda-setting Republican representatives responsible for poor performance by voting them out?
 It's easier to answer this question if you leave out the six states that didn't elect any Republicans in 2000; after all, they didn't have any to throw out. If you also remove New Hampshire and South Dakota, where the percentage of Republicans elected dropped to 0 from 100 -- each state only has one seat in the House -- a pattern starts to appear. 
 It suggests that differences in economic performance could have had a big political impact, even though the overall changes to the delegations were small. In the 10 states where personal income grew the most, the Republican share of the states' House delegations dropped only 2 percent, on average. In the other 32 states, the Republican share fell an average of 7 percent. 
 None of this proves a correlation between economics and politics, or, for that matter, any causality. To be sure of any of these statistical relationships, you would have to adjust for anything else that might have affected the economy differentially across states from 2000 to 2006: things as diverse as changes in tax policy or demographic shifts. Then you could tell whether the correlations were robust. And it's by no means certain that they would be: looking at unemployment rates instead of personal income, it's tough to pick out any patterns in the raw data.
 Still, both parties have a clear incentive to learn whether these relationships exist. Winners who figure out why they won stand a better chance of winning again; losers who know why they lost won't repeat the same mistakes.
 Statistics or no, the Democrats already seem to be convinced. They have promised a raft of economic legislation during their first weeks in power, proposing to raise the minimum wage to $7.25, to cut the interest rate on student loans in half and to require any new spending to be paid for by cuts to other spending or new tax revenue.
 Without a Democratic president, of course, it will be much harder to turn these bills into law. For that reason, voters might not hold the Democrats responsible for economic performance the way they apparently did with the Republicans. Then again, if personal income doesn't rise, they might blame the Democrats -- and the statistics might just tell the tale.

HEADLINE: The New Ambassadors 

BYLINE: By JEFF LEEDS; Ben Sisario contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CRAMMED in a van loaded with guitars, a drum kit and a couple of Fender amplifiers, and driving from one American gig to the next, the four scruffy musicians in the indie-rock band the Figurines tried mightily to enjoy themselves. They snapped pictures of one another, ate junk food and drank Red Bull, which is barred from sale back home in Denmark. 
 Sometimes they drink it spiked with vodka. But on a recent trip through Idaho, on a desolate road outside Boise, one band member was drinking it straight from the can.
Catching a glimpse through the van's window, a passing trucker saw the shiny can and mistook it, somehow, for a gun. 
 Within minutes, the police were ordering the band out of the vehicle. ''We had to get down on our knees on the highway,'' Christian Hjelm, the lead singer and guitarist, said, and they then found themselves handcuffed and sitting in the back of a squad car.
 It might be a typical war story for a rumpled rock band on the road. But the Figurines, who played at the recent CMJ Music Marathon in New York, aren't just a rumpled rock band on the road. They're part of an unusual class of cultural ambassadors and trade envoys, hand-picked by their government to represent their nation to the rest of the world.
 The Figurines, who received more than $18,000 in financing through Denmark's export agency this year, are just one of hundreds of bands that occupy this odd dual status: on the one hand, road-weary independent musicians; on the other, appointed emissaries of their homelands. 
 In a little-understood chapter in the history of cultural exchange, nations from around the world have been choosing musical outfits and sending them to the biggest music markets abroad in hopes of raising their international profile and generating export sales. In a way, it makes perfect sense. 
 In a global economy that is blurring geographic borders, more and more nations view intellectual property -- films, software and the like -- as valuable commodities, easily transferred exports that can sell in previously inaccessible markets. That includes intellectual property like pop-punk or death metal. Digitally distributed, music is easier to export than ever. And the artists, many of whom have long dreamed of taking a shot at the Billboard chart, are mostly happy to play along. 
 But even viewed as a product, rock 'n' roll might not seem ready-made for government promotion. The diplomatic corps and, say, college radio darlings don't have much experience speaking each other's languages. (In America, where acts like Green Day and Pearl Jam have been racking up radio hits with songs that attack the administration, musicians aren't accustomed to speaking to the government at all.) And the efforts don't lend themselves to easy analysis. What white-paper policy report could quantify the value of an upbeat review in Spin? And how reliable is an export that might have a taste for trashing hotel rooms and wearing perilously tight pants? 
 Can would-be music stars really be put to this new use? 
 ''It ultimately comes down to what one thinks of activity of the state on behalf of art or commerce,'' said Brent Grulke, creative director of the annual Austin festival South by Southwest, which along with CMJ has emerged as a bazaar of internationally financed talent. ''Clearly one of the more inexpensive things that we can produce that potentially has great financial rewards is our culture. For nations that have any kind of forethought into the future of their economies, it's a no-brainer.''
 One way or another, between the musicians who are representing their countries abroad and the government officials who are seeking out and signing new talent, the international trend has forced all parties to invent new rules, and new roles, in situations that none of them could have anticipated.
 IN 2002 the Hives, an immaculately tailored garage-rock band from Fagersta, Sweden, seized the spotlight with the American release of the album ''Veni Vidi Vicious,'' and before long Swedish acts like Division of Laura Lee and Sahara Hotnights were having their moment too. They got the gigs, but to a large degree their home country got the credit: ''Sweden Rocks,'' declared Rolling Stone. 
 The Hives' second major United States release flopped. But by then talent scouts had been booking trans-Pacific flights to see rock acts like the Datsuns and the D4 in New Zealand, which some described as ''the new Sweden.'' The year 2004 unquestionably belonged to Canada, which bred indie-rock bands like the Arcade Fire, Stars and Broken Social Scene just in time to draw praise from the emerging music blogosphere. 
 From outward appearances, it might seem that the cultural compass just spins at random from one country to the next. But more and more the ''next big thing'' title may reflect the deliberate efforts of government trade and culture officials, who routinely attend American music festivals, organize junkets for critics and record executives, and arrange coaching and subsidies for their homegrown acts. In Canada, which has one of the most established programs, artists can apply for an array of grants or loans to finance up to 75 percent of recording costs, advertising, marketing or touring expenses.
 Heather Ostertag, chief executive of Factor, the public-private Canadian agency that oversees music funds, said it controls a budget of roughly $12.4 million and handed out awards to one-third or more of the 3,800 applicants who sought support last year. Broken Social Scene and its label, for example, have been offered more than $140,000, she said. The Arcade Fire and Stars were also beneficiaries.
 Why does the government of the world's second biggest land mass bother? ''The government recognizes the importance of a cultural spend for a cultural identity,'' Ms. Ostertag said. ''I think that we struggle as Canadians for our own Canadian identity. American dominance is so prevalent wherever you go.'' Part of maintaining the nation's place on the cultural map, she added, ''is happening through identifying ourselves through the success of other Canadians.''
 In Australia state and federal governments offer a series of programs. The country's main export program offers to cover up to 50 percent of an act's costs above the equivalent of $11,600. Over the last year trade officials provided roughly $1.8 million in grants to 80 recipients aimed at exporting their music. Past recipients included the Wiggles, the phenomenally popular music group catering to children.
 New Zealand has for several years helped cover recording costs, and recently created subsidies, overseen by music and broadcasting professionals, for artists and labels aiming to sell overseas. One recent grant went to Michael Tucker, who wanted to open a United States office for his independent label and marketing company, Loop Recordings. A fast-talking former hairdresser and fashion photographer, Mr. Tucker recently oversaw a show by one of his bands, the funk-reggae outfit the Black Seeds, at a swanky Los Angeles lounge. But not long ago he found himself at a government function hobnobbing with his government's top ministers. ''I can shave,'' he laughed. ''I can play that game.''
 TO many artists, even to many bands involved in these programs, federal financing may not initially seem very rock 'n' roll. After the Hives took Sweden's money, the band's lead singer, Pelle Almqvist, fumed that tax-financed rock was ''like working for the Man.'' 
 ''Plus,'' he added, ''we were'' -- well, they weren't very good -- ''at filling in all the paperwork.''
 Samuel Scott, a singer and guitarist in a New Zealand rock band called the Phoenix Foundation, sympathizes. ''I think that image, that rock 'n' roll is a thing of rebellion and that you should be flipping the bird to the government, is prevalent,'' he said. ''In most parts of the world it's a situation where you might give up for the sake of not starving to death. In New Zealand I think you have a bit longer to look at it before you have to make that choice.'' 
 And in America, it seems, you have to look at it longest of all. ''People over here are shocked when we tell them you can get economical support from the government,'' said Mr. Hjelm of the Figurines. ''It's not because of the money that people know us over here. It's because of the music. But you need that financial support to do those tours. We know we have the support, and it makes us concentrate 100 percent on the music.''
 Andrew Wilson, the lead singer of the New Zealand art-rock band Die! Die! Die!, said that when he and his chums received approval for their first grant -- about $3,300 in United States dollars for studio time and a producer to help record a demo single -- they used the money to buy a van instead. (An acquaintance recorded their single free.) That allowed them to tour, and eventually to scrape together enough money to buy airfare to the United States, where they spent three weeks playing house parties and crashing on strangers' floors. 
 The band later applied for, and received, more financing -- about $4,000 -- to return to America for another sweep. That tour included a stop in Austin for South by Southwest, several East Coast dates and a visit to Oakland, Calif., where Mr. Wilson smashed his white Stratocaster guitar and leapt onto a fan at a club called Grandma's -- a moment in cultural diplomacy now immortalized on YouTube. 
 That led to another trip, which in August brought the band back to New York, where Mr. Wilson said he was mugged at gunpoint one night by two young men on bicycles. ''They stole my iPod and all my money,'' he recalled. ''It was totally like my cliche idea of America.'' 
 Good times. But Mr. Wilson, whose trips to the United States helped find the band find a manager and a contract with the independent label S.A.F. Records, says he thinks that while the national subsidies may have strengthened New Zealand's music industry, they have also bred complacency. ''Bands are a lot more reliant on grants than they should be,'' he said.
 That perception is something these government agencies work hard to avoid. Scotland's Arts Council, for example, commissioned an independent entrepreneur to perform a cost analysis of the money the country devoted to South by Southwest in 2005. The 45-page report concludes that Scotland got its money's worth from the $:6,000 it gave the band the Delgados and their label, Chemikal Underground, to cover travel expenses for a gig. As a result of meetings held there, one of the Delgados' songs was used in the television show ''The O.C.,'' at a fee of $:6,667 (about $13,000) and the band was featured in a spread in the music magazine NME that the government valued at more than $:13,000. 
 Alas, the band broke up. But does it make sense -- is it even really possible -- to apply a cost-benefit analysis to the export of indie rock? It all depends on what the purpose of these programs is, beyond broad platitudes. Most export officials say they are trying to gin up acts that can achieve commercial success -- steady concert ticket sales and, potentially radio airplay -- without sounding like copycats of existing United States acts. ''We don't want to bring sand to the Arabs,'' said Gary Fortune, a former executive at BMG who now heads New Zealand's fledgling export program. 
 It doesn't always work out that way. Adam Shore, who runs the Vice Recordings label and magazine, and who recently promoted an event at CMJ with the Norwegian consulate, says certain Scandinavian countries always ''wind up sending over bands that sound like bands we already have.'' 
 ''Is the endgame selling a lot of records in America,'' he asked, ''or is the endgame exposing America to their culture and their kind of people?''
 Last year Australia's trade commission hired a former talent executive from BMI, which represents songwriters in the United States and collects their royalties, to help introduce their musicians to American listeners. Now you can listen to an all-Aussie podcast or visit an Aussie singer-songwriter show every other month. And whether coincidentally or not, this year the music establishment has been abuzz over the Led Zeppelinish rock trio Wolfmother, which despite selling 300,000 copies of its American debut will still apply to have the government reimburse its travel expenses.
 The more such successes these early experiments produce, the more are likely to be undertaken. Which will result in more frequent-flyer miles, and more strange encounters from the world of government rock. 
 In their home country, Finland, and at European rock festivals, the earnest rockers Bloodpit are used to playing to hordes of fans. But when a government grant brought the band to America earlier this year, it played at a Los Angeles club during Musexpo, an upstart music conference specializing in international talent. 
 ''The only thing that was different,'' said Matthau Mikojan, who sings and plays guitar with the band, ''was that in the audience, instead of our fans, there were suits.''

HEADLINE: Why Buybacks Aren't Always Good News

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
ONE force behind the stock market's recent strength has been the flood of money that corporate America has poured into share buyback programs. According to Standard & Poor's, the companies in its flagship 500-stock index are on track to repurchase more than $435 billion worth of their shares this year. That's significantly more than the $349 billion repurchased in 2005 and more than triple the $131 billion in shares that were bought in 2003. 
 Many investors applaud the buyback binge, considering these programs entirely beneficial. After all, buybacks support a company's stock price and buoy per-share earnings by reducing the amount of stock outstanding.
But less obvious to investors are the downsides associated with buybacks. By artificially inflating a company's earnings per share, repurchases can mask business slowdowns, for example. Companies can hurt their financial positions by putting scarce cash into repurchases. And when buybacks are used to offset multitudinous stock option grants to corporate executives, an even more pernicious outcome can occur: the purchases may actually destroy shareholder value by forcing companies to essentially buy stock in the open market at high prices to cover shares sold at lower prices to executives. 
 Furthermore, it may not surprise you to learn, buybacks can wind up bolstering top executives' compensation. A new study by Jill Lehman, a managing director at the Center for Financial Research Analysis, and Paul Hodgson, a senior research associate at the Corporate Library, makes these and other risks clear.
 ''If a company is generating negative cash flows prior to the buybacks it seems that they shouldn't also be using cash to buy back those shares,'' said Marc A. Siegel, director of research at the C.F.R.A. ''With all the buybacks going on, we thought it would be interesting to marry up which companies might be executing fiscally unwarranted repurchases with companies where executives are being compensated on metrics that are benefited by buybacks.'' 
 Thankfully, the study found only three companies that had negative cash flows over the past three years before accounting for the costs of their share reductions. They were Dominion Resources, Ryder System, and the Southern Company. 
 But the story definitely becomes more interesting as one looks at compensation practices among S.& P. companies making repurchases and generating negative cash flows as a result for the last two years. A total of 78 companies meeting those requirements popped up. 
 Of these companies, the study found, 33 used an earnings-per-share measure to analyze performance when determining executive pay -- that's about 42 percent. Among the S.& P. 500 as a whole, only 28 percent of the companies used that measure. Per-share measures, of course, are hardly exact barometers of financial performance because they can be greatly influenced by the reduction in shares outstanding associated with buyback programs.
 This disparity makes one wonder whether some repurchase programs have been instituted to generate higher levels of earnings per share, thereby ensuring the payout of short- and long-term incentives. 
 The study found that chief executives at 89 percent of these 78 share-repurchasing companies received an annual bonus in 2005, compared with 78 percent of chief executives for all companies in the S.& P. 500. 
 In addition, companies in the group that use per-share performance measures were more likely to have paid a bonus to their chief executives last year. At the 33 companies using such measures, only 3 percent did not pay out an annual bonus in 2005; by comparison, 13 percent of the companies in the sample that did not use per-share measures failed to pay a bonus.
 The median bonus among negative-cash-flow companies that have bought back shares was also a bit higher than it was in the S.& P. as a whole: $1,565,050 versus $1,487,800.
 While earnings per share is a commonly accepted measure of short-term corporate performance, the study's authors questioned its effectiveness in assessing long-term value growth. Nevertheless, some of the buyback companies use earnings per share to assess performance for both the short term and the long term, ''a very poor governance practice resulting in the same set of performance achievements being rewarded twice,'' the study said.
 Eight companies did this: Eli Lilly, Hershey, Huntington Bancshares, Masco, Pitney Bowes, Procter & Gamble, Pulte Homes and Robert Half International.
 The study said that none of the companies that engaged in share repurchases and used an earnings-per-share measure discussed in their proxies the impact of buyback programs on their pay calculations. Home Depot, a company that has been criticized for its pay practices, did the right thing starting in 2004 by excluding the effects of share repurchases during the performance period when measuring earnings per share for compensation purposes. But this year, the company said its long-term incentive plan would no longer be adjusted for the impact of share repurchases. 
 The chief executive's incentive plan at Countrywide Financial, a mortgage lender that has engaged in buybacks, seems designed to get a big boost from earnings-per-share growth, the study said. While other executives at the company receive pay based on growth in its return on equity, Angelo R. Mozilo's bonus is based solely on earnings per share. Mr. Mozilo has received bonuses worth $56.7 million in the past three years. Countrywide did not return a phone call seeking comment. 
 As buybacks have ballooned, the study said, some companies conducting the programs have changed their pay-for-performance targets to include earnings per share. In 2004, for example, Eli Lilly moved from a bonus plan that assessed changes in economic value at the company to one that measured moves in earnings per share.
 Philip Belt, a Lilly spokesman, said his company's buybacks were so small relative to its market value that linking the program to executive pay was ludicrous. ''In the last two years, our total buybacks have been approximately half a billion dollars, a very small amount,'' he said.
 Spokeswomen for Masco and Hershey said that their compensation committees consider the impact of share buybacks when they set executive pay. And a Ryder spokesman said that the company's negative cash flow position was a temporary imbalance because recent capital expenditures will generate revenues from contracts over time. He said the buyback program offsets stock grants and employee share purchase plans at the company. 
 Clearly, not all buybacks are created equal -- at least for investors. And as the numbers of buybacks grow, the manner in which they may mask a company's true performance becomes more problematic. 
 ''We have a concern here that investors may not appreciate the full impact that the buyback has on the earnings per share,'' said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.& P. ''When the buybacks stop, where is the growth going to come from?'' 
 Adding to the anxiety about repurchases, Mr. Silverblatt said, is the fact that the shares have not been completely retired. The company can bring them back onto the market at any point; this would dilute existing shareholders' stakes.
 ''What is the company going to be doing with these shares?'' he asked. ''It is an enormous amount of assets under control of management that has not been retired and could be put back into the market.'' Using cash to pay dividends would be far preferable, of course, especially given the lower tax rates that apply to such payments. But managements are wary of dividends because, once they grant them, shareholders come to expect them. 
 Buyback programs look great from a distance. Up close, however, the picture blurs. More significantly, they may be a way for some corporate managers to think, once again, of themselves first and their owners second.

HEADLINE: A Maximum Traveler (And His Maxims) 

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
I AM your humble correspondent, and, as such, travel constantly. I am on the road more than I am at home, flying hither and yon to educate and amuse and pay for the vast army of men and women who depend on little me to keep them alive and able to spend time at movies and nail salons and in front of computer games. 
 As I travel, I join many similar millions. We talk, exchange stories, make systems and create rules and laws of business travel. Because I have no better friends than you who are reading this, I now share these rules in the hope that you will learn from them and achieve the Zen-like state of acceptance that we maximum travelers achieve. 
Herewith, for your peace of mind and so that you will not be surprised, are the Iron Laws of Business Travel:
 Look around the boarding area for the person talking the loudest on his cellphone, smelling the most of stale beer. The more obnoxious he or she is, the greater the certainty that he or she will be sitting directly in front of you. 
 The likelihood that your seat will not recline is a direct function of the certainty that the person in front of you will recline as far back as possible. 
 The chance that your plane will leave on time is an inverse function of the importance of reaching your destination on time. 
 The likelihood that your flight will reach its destination on time is a function of how much time you have to catch your connecting flight. That is, the less time you have to catch that connecting flight, the more certain that your plane will be late; the more time you have to catch that flight, the more likely that your plane will be on time. 
 Late arrivals will be compounded by incompetence. If your plane is already late, for example, you can be certain that it (a) will not have a gate when it gets in, (b) will not have a crew to make the jetway meet the plane and (c) will not have a crew that, once it appears, knows how to operate the jetway. 
 The chance that the plane's galley will run out of any desirable entree just before it's your turn to make a selection is a direct function of your hunger. 
 The likelihood of not finding a taxi, or of your driver failing to show up, is a function of the probability of measurable precipitation. It is also a function of your proximity to downtown Manhattan. That is, the likelihood of a car appearing when you need it is lowest in New York City, highest in Anchorage.
 The chance that your driver will know the way to your destination is an inverse function of your fatigue and your need to use the restroom -- and of the density of traffic between the airport and the hotel.
 The chance that your room reservation will be lost is a direct function of your exhaustion and frustration before reaching the hotel. The likelihood of a desk clerk caring much about whether you have a room is an inverse function of the room's price. That is, the more the room costs, the more contemptuous the service. This is doubled in New York City.
 The chance that you will get the type of room you reserved is also an inverse function of the room's cost.
 The more that you detest tobacco, the less likely that you will have a nonsmoking room. 
 The more urgent your need to use the Internet, the less likely that the connection will work. 
 The probability of your getting a room next to the hotel elevator is directly proportional to how many times you tell the desk clerk that you do not want a room next to the elevator.
 The earlier your morning meeting, the more likely that an amateur porn movie is being filmed in the next room. 
 The chance of having bedbugs is a direct function of the snootiness of the hotel. The same is true of the likelihood that your bed will not be made properly, with about three inches of bare mattress showing at the bottom of the bed. The chance that housekeeping will be available or willing to fix the problem is zero at any hotel where the room costs over $300 a night. 
 The likelihood that your bank will call to tell you that you are overdrawn is the cubic function of how many miles you are from your bank, and how far your spouse is from the bank. 
 The likelihood of insomnia is a quadratic function of how early you have to wake up in the morning. 
 The likelihood that noisy construction will start before 8 a.m. near your room is perfectly correlated to the sum of the room's cost, your fatigue level and the hour when your day begins. 
 The likelihood that your teenage child will appreciate your business-travel efforts approaches zero as a limit; it is certain that the appreciation will be zero if you have recently bought that teenager a car. 
 It never gets any better. 
 You just get older. 
 Now you know. And now that you do, remember that acceptance is power, peace and serenity. And it is never cool to yell at a flight attendant or a gate agent.

HEADLINE: A Boom In Jobs, And Fear

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AMERICA'S biggest export, it sometimes seems, is jobs. A shocking new study by the Hackett Group, the consulting firm whose specialty is helping big business improve back-office operations, says the Fortune 500 companies could save $58 billion annually by moving more of these activities offshore.
 But the truly shocking thing about this number is how small it is. Last year, the Fortune 500 had revenue of $9.1 trillion. Moving more back-office operations overseas, in other words, could cut costs by way less than 1 percent of sales. A nice boost to profits, but hardly earth-shaking. 
Here at home, meanwhile, it's raining jobs -- an estimated 5.8 million new ones in just five years, according to a recent Labor Department report. The government's household employment survey showed a gain of 437,000 jobs in October alone. Unemployment that month fell to just 4.4 percent, a 5 1/2-year low. Jobs are so abundant that investors are worried that the Federal Reserve may delay making interest rate cuts, lest inflation revive. The concern is that all these new jobs may lead employers to bid up wages, heaven forbid. 
 There are so many jobs, in fact, that we can't fill them all ourselves. Instead, we rely on millions of immigrants to pick up the slack. The supply of employment opportunities in this country was demonstrated by President Bush's recent authorization of a 700-mile fence along the Mexican border. There is gainful employment here, and plenty of it.
 Don't let the recent election-season rhetoric fool you. The nature of American work is changing, but jobs are abundant, and the dynamic nature of the economy is one reason that they will remain so. Outsourcing isn't likely to change this in the foreseeable future, and I suspect that it's even helping to sustain domestic job growth by promoting efficiency and thereby freeing capital for better uses. We even gain jobs by insourcing -- by receiving jobs from other countries. Toyota and Honda, for example, have thousands of employees in the United States.
 While Hackett says that ''increased use of offshore resources may impact up to 1.47 million general and administrative jobs,'' the Organization for International Investment, a business group representing American units of foreign companies, says that such domestic subsidiaries employ 5.4 million people in this country. In all likelihood, that total will grow.
 SO the real issue isn't saving jobs. It's helping those whose skills suddenly become obsolete to adjust to the new world around them. The big new job gains, for example, mask continuing job losses in manufacturing as well as recent declines in construction employment, meaning more bad news for people who work with their hands. That, in turn, suggests more income inequality ahead. Washington, despite its recent track record of bungling on so many fronts, will need to play a role in helping these people and their communities adjust, and unfortunately that's one job we can't easily send offshore.
 Nor is it one that we can expect the private sector to handle. Troubled by soaring health care costs, companies are withdrawing from their longstanding role as providers of medical insurance. They've also moved away from providing long-term job security or traditional defined-benefit pensions. Maybe that style of employment no longer suits a changing world, or maybe corporations are too busy back-dating executive stock options to worry about taking care of their rank-and-file employees.
 Either way, companies are getting out of the social welfare business -- and I say good riddance. What business is really good at, aside from generating wealth, is generating jobs. Social welfare is the business of government. 
 Some important questions were rarely debated in the recent election. What should be done -- and what can be done -- for the losers in this time of rapid economic change? How much inequality are we willing to accept? What do we want our society to look like? And, perhaps most important, is our government up to the job of changing the picture?
 The next big election is in 2008, and some presidential candidate may yet make a splash by promising to clamp down on free trade, curtail immigration and embrace isolationism, all in the name of protecting American workers. That would be a far more effective job-destruction strategy than the outsourcing that may yet become a campaign issue.

HEADLINE: Is the Time Still Right for Foreign Bond Funds? 

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
AMERICAN investors have become quite enamored of foreign stocks in recent years, but they haven't fallen nearly as hard for foreign bonds.
 Roughly 90 percent of the money that Americans have poured into international mutual funds this year has gone into stock funds, according to AMG Data Services; as for domestic investments, Americans have put roughly 70 percent into bond funds.
Neglecting foreign bond funds may be shortsighted. Many bond experts say that a little foreign diversification can be good for the fixed-income side of a portfolio -- and can help smooth out returns if there's a decline in the dollar. 
 That said, some experts caution that this may not be the best time to put new money into foreign bonds. In particular, they say that investors shouldn't expect foreign bond funds to keep outpacing domestic bond funds as much as they have so far this year. 
 Funds that invest in emerging-markets debt have returned more than 8 percent this year, while a broader foreign bond fund category has returned more than 4 percent. Funds that buy long-term United States Treasury issues, meanwhile, have struggled to eke out 1 percent, according to Morningstar. 
 ''One reason that foreign bonds have outperformed over the last year is because the Fed was raising rates while other countries were not,'' said John Donohue, the chief investment officer in the fixed-income group of J. P. Morgan Asset Management.
 Bond prices fall when interest rates rise. Mr. Donohue predicts that Treasuries will fare better than foreign bonds next year, on an absolute basis, because the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates. But he says he thinks that the dollar will fall against other currencies, which would benefit Americans who hold some foreign bonds denominated in those currencies -- for example, in an unhedged foreign bond fund. 
 That view of interest rates and the dollar is becoming fairly common among bond experts.
 ''We think the U.S. economy is going to slow, and inflation pressure is going to subside,'' said Martin J. Mauro, the fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch. Mr. Mauro said he thought that the Federal Reserve would cut its benchmark short-term interest rate to around 4 percent by the end of 2007, from its current 5.25 percent.
 On the other hand, Mr. Mauro said he expected British and European central bankers to raise rates next year. While he is cautious about bonds from other developed countries, he said the risks were far greater for emerging-markets bonds, which have soared in recent years. He said investors were now being paid very little extra interest for owning emerging-markets bonds, compared with United States Treasuries. On average, he said that the difference was only 1.85 percentage points; four years ago, the emerging-markets bonds were paying 8 points more than Treasuries.
 ''If there should be any slowdown in global economies,'' Mr. Mauro said, ''emerging markets would suffer the most.'' 
 The outlook for foreign interest rates is only one part of the picture. Foreign currency markets can have a much stronger impact on foreign bond funds, which generally come in two varieties with respect to currencies. They are either hedged -- eliminating the risk of foreign currency markets -- or not hedged. If you invest in a hedged fund, you have to worry only about the relative interest rates in the countries where it invests. But keep in mind that the dollar's slide this year was responsible for a large part of the gains in unhedged foreign bond funds.
 Consider Pimco, which specializes in fixed-income portfolios and has both hedged and unhedged foreign bond funds. Sudi Mariappa, who manages both the Pimco Foreign Bond (U.S. Dollar Hedged) fund and the Pimco Foreign Bond (U.S. Dollar Unhedged) fund, says that the two portfolios aren't clones, but that they have very similar holdings. This year through Thursday, the unhedged foreign bond fund returned 5.3 percent while the hedged foreign bond fund returned 2.6 percent.
 The unhedged fund started trading in 2005. But Mr. Mariappa has managed its hedged cousin since 2000, with average annual returns of 4.5 percent over the last five years. Both funds yield more than 2.5 percent and have expense ratios of 0.95 percent. 
 Mr. Mariappa said that there was now a stronger case for unhedged foreign bond funds, because of a weak outlook for the dollar, but he thought that Treasuries might outperform foreign bonds on an absolute basis next year.
 ''We expect U.S. rates to fall more than foreign rates,'' he said, ''so you'll get a bigger capital gain by holding U.S. bonds.'' 
 Ian Kelson, who manages the T. Rowe Price International Bond fund, says that his fund never has exposure to the dollar, but that he will hedge one foreign currency against another. For example, he says he thinks that the Japanese yen is very cheap now, and that he expects it to rise against the dollar. But he also expects Japanese central bankers to raise interest rates. So he has lightened up on Japanese bonds, while emphasizing the yen.
 T. Rowe Price International Bond, which Mr. Kelson has managed since 2000, has had average annual returns of 8.3 percent over the last five years; so far this year, it has returned 6 percent. The fund yields 3.1 percent and charges 0.86 percent in annual expenses.
 Investment strategists usually recommend holding most types of bonds in tax-deferred accounts, because taxes on the bonds' interest are usually higher than taxes on dividends from stocks. The main exceptions to this general rule are municipal bonds, which should be held in taxable accounts because they receive favorable tax treatment.
 Some strategists advise against any investment in an unhedged fund if you will need the money within a year or two. That is because a short-term spike in the dollar could easily wipe out the interest earned. 
 FINALLY, if you are interested only in shielding your portfolio from a decline in the dollar, you can opt for one of the relatively new foreign currency exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.'s. These provide direct exposure to foreign currencies like the euro, the British pound or the Swedish krona. They are basically money market accounts that are held in each currency, so they do not have the interest-rate risk of longer-duration bonds in those currencies.
 But Mr. Donohue of J. P. Morgan warns that investing in a specific foreign currency is not for the faint of heart. He said that investors who didn't own any foreign bonds or foreign currencies might want to put 5 to 10 percent of their fixed-income portfolio into an unhedged foreign bond fund that invests in developed markets, and that this would probably be a lot less jarring than owning a single-currency E.T.F. 
 ''Currency is a very volatile asset class,'' he said. ''If you're wrong you can get really smoked.''

HEADLINE: An Eye On the Fed, And on Philadelphia

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
RATE cut? What rate cut?
 Many investors had hoped that the Federal Reserve was about to lower interest rates after a two-year tightening cycle, but an exceptionally strong jobs report on Nov. 3 has left them unsure which way the Fed will move next. Plenty of economic reports this week may offer clues. 
 Anthony Karydakis, chief United States economist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management, will be studying three in particular, highlighting consumer prices, retail sales and, of all things, manufacturing in and around Philadelphia. 
 ''Normally it shouldn't be a big deal -- a regional survey, who cares?'' he said. The report, from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, is due on Thursday. ''But two months ago it showed a big decline out of the blue.'' The same result occurred the next month, and the stock market took a hit, he recalled. 
 ''Everyone in the world expects a rebound in November,'' said Mr. Karydakis, who is leaving J. P. Morgan next month. ''If we get it, it will prove the last two months were a fluke.'' A Bloomberg News poll of economists forecasts a 5 percent gain in the measure.
 The poll also predicts a 0.4 percent decline in retail sales for October; that report is to be released Tuesday. Mr. Karydakis is looking for a decline of 0.4 percent or 0.5 percent.
 He expects no decline in the core Consumer Price Index for October, due on Thursday. This measure, which excludes food and energy items, could be especially troublesome for the markets, he warned. The Bloomberg poll calls for a 0.2 percent monthly increase; anything higher would send the annual inflation rate to 3 percent or more.
 ''That would be ominous,'' Mr. Karydakis said. A figure beginning with ''3'' ''is something that psychologically can prove to be very unsettling,'' he said. ''It's not going to go over well at all for either the stock or bond market.'' 
 If these reports come in as he foresees, ''the net-net is it's inconceivable the Fed will be easing over the next four to five months,'' he said. 
 ''If anything,'' he added, ''in the second half of next year the Fed may have to tweak its monetary policy with another hike.''

DATA WATCH -- Almost lost amid all the other numbers are two indicators of the health of the housing market. Housing starts for October, to be reported Friday, are expected to show a decline to an annual rate of 1.675 million units from 1.772 million in September. The forecast for building permits, a figure that anticipates construction activity, is for a gain to an annual rate of 1.625 million units from 1.619 million.

War on the Middle Class
How the Government, Big Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the American Dream and How to Fight Back.
By Lou Dobbs.
276 pp. Viking. $24.95.
 The Korean War is known by many as ''the forgotten war'' -- a conflict ignored because of its proximity to other wars. But there is a difference between a war that is forgotten and one that is deliberately ignored even as it rages in our midst. That kind of war is the subject of Lou Dobbs's fist-pounding new book, ''War on the Middle Class,'' which exposes a vicious economic battle being waged against the vast majority of Americans.
Dobbs seems an unlikely general to lead this fight. A financial journalist, he was the longtime anchor of CNN's ''Moneyline,'' where, as The Wall Street Journal noted, ''his opinions generally were seen as unabashedly pro-business.'' 
 That changed when Dobbs returned after a two-year hiatus from CNN and revealed a new personality: the pinstriped populist. His current program, ''Lou Dobbs Tonight'' (on which I have been a guest), follows his book's central thesis: ''Our political, business and academic elites are waging an outright war on Americans.''
 He examines this economic war in chapters on wages, corruption, trade, outsourcing, immigration and health care, showing how moneyed interests devise policies that harm the public, and offering up his own set of solutions.
 For Dobbs, there are no sacred cows. Sometimes his zeal runs too hot, as when he attacks religious organizations that favor amnesty for illegal immigrants with the same fire he unleashes on corporate front groups that support illegal immigration because it provides cheap labor. But more often he is right on target, as when he expertly skewers a health care system riddled by profiteering.
 The book is driven by Dobbs's seething yet remarkably matter-of-fact style. His refreshing prose, like his on-air persona, combines seemingly unmixable ingredients -- one part Ted Koppel authority, one part Bill O'Reilly bluster and one part Howard Beale ''I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore'' outrage.
 Occasionally Dobbs seems unwilling to risk his tough image by exploring difficult issues. For example, he neglects to go beyond simple law-and-order rhetoric about border security and ask why so many Mexicans risk their lives attempting to immigrate illegally to our country in the first place.
 While our border security does need improvement, illegal immigration is a result of America's having an impoverished country at its southern border and a trade policy that has helped push 19 million more Mexicans into poverty over the last two decades. Many Mexicans who illegally cross the border are motivated not by nefarious criminal intent but by sheer economic desperation. Except for a few fleeting mentions, Dobbs avoids connecting these issues in pursuit of a serious fix. Why? Maybe he knows that the real solution includes both improving border security and building Mexico's economy -- and that may be a save-the-world message far less appealing to his followers than his usual tough-on-crime mantra.
 Dobbs also peddles a few hackneyed right-wing talking points. For instance, he excoriates the news media as ''liberal.'' This charge comes in a chapter that berates reporters for refusing to cover economic issues from what would generally be considered a more working-class, ''liberal'' perspective.
 But then, that is probably one of his book's most important, if unstated, points: cultural liberalism focusing on social issues that have only varying degrees of support among the general population is far different from full-throated Dobbs-style economic populism.
 It is undeniable that aside from Dobbs and a few politicians, America's political debate is almost entirely devoid of economic populists. ''War on the Middle Class'' confronts this problem head-on -- and thanks to Dobbs's passion and charisma, it succeeds in sounding an alarm that cannot be ignored.

THE WAR OF THE WORLD
Twentieth-Century Conflict and the Descent of the West.
By Niall Ferguson.
Illustrated. 808 pp. The Penguin Press. $35.
 ''PUBLISHED on the eve of the 20th century, H. G. Wells's 'The War of the Worlds' (1898) is much more than just a seminal work of science fiction. It is also a kind of Darwinian morality tale, and at the same time, a work of singular prescience. In the century after the publication of his book, scenes like the ones Wells imagined became a reality in cities all over the world.'' 
So begins Niall Ferguson's ''War of the World,'' a hugely ambitious panorama and moral analysis of the military-industrial slaughter of the 20th century that poses the big question: Why was it that ''the hundred years after 1900 were without question the bloodiest century in modern history''? Ferguson answers his own question: ''Three things seem to me necessary to explain the extreme violence of the 20th century. ... These may be summarized as ethnic conflict, economic volatility and empires in decline.'' There is another theme in this colossal survey: the Spengleresque ''descent of the West,'' by which he means that the American Century will actually be remembered for the exhaustion of the West and the rise of China.
 The subject matter here is dark (mass murder) and overfamiliar (World Wars I and II), the text is 646 pages long and accompanies a television series, four reasons for any reviewer to dread his task -- but it turns out to have been a highly enjoyable one. Ferguson's conclusions are sensible and cleareyed even if they are not revelatory. He relishes pungent turns of phrase, witty footnotes and provocative flashes of revisionism -- like the perfectly reasonable suggestion that World War II really started with the Japanese push in China in 1937 and not with the German invasion of Poland in 1939. Yet he is always sound on the fundamentals, and on the right side.
 Ferguson is a fine narrator and impressive scholar, but above all he is a passionate teacher who understands that his responsibility in an age of philistine education and mass ignorance is to teach us the lessons of history. His achievement is to create a heartbreaking, serious and thoughtful survey of human evil that is utterly fascinating and dramatic, and always has something new to tell us. His book can be variously enjoyed as superb narrative history, a collection of essays on the key themes of the 20th century or just a sumptuous treasure trove of fresh facts and the latest scholarly interpretations.
 He begins with ethnicity and genetics: ''paradoxically ... a sharp rise in assimilation ... may actually be the prelude to ethnic conflict.'' Such conflict, Ferguson writes, was most likely to occur in regions of ''mixed settlement'' like the Balkans. He charts German anti-Semitism, with its strong sexual obsession, from the very start of the century: ''Some German anti-Semitic literature was crudely sensationalist. ... In a tract entitled 'Brothel Jews,' it was alleged that Jews considered 'the corruption of our virgins, the trade in girls, the seduction of women as no sin, but a sacrifice that they make to their Jehovah; the same applies to the spread of degenerative diseases and plagues.' '' He is equally good on how, as the concept of ethnic exclusivity and nationalism spread, the Jews, the ultimate cosmopolitans, found themselves under pressure across Russia and Central Europe: ''These Yids,'' Czar Alexander III said, ''make themselves too repulsive to Russians, and as long as they continue to exploit Christians, this hatred will not diminish.'' But Ferguson also shows how czarist authorities did not organize most pogroms, since they feared disorder more than they feared Jews.
 World War I is described as ''nothing more than the most terrific train crash'': Ferguson reveals how all the participants were soon brutalized into killing their prisoners. ''Don't take prisoners, kill them,'' an Irish soldier recalls a clergyman telling him. Yet this brutality kept armies together. When the killing instinct wavered among the Germans, they started to surrender. 
 In his section on Stalin's terror, Ferguson concentrates on an aspect only recently revealed by newly available archives. Stalin, it turns out, regarded not only class as hereditary but cultural characteristics as well, and resolved to purge and deport entire populations like the Poles and Koreans. Ethnic cleansing began in Russia before Hitler took it up. ''Whole peoples were ... marked down for destruction.'' They would be ''crushed under the wheels of the Stalinist juggernaut. ... For Stalin regarded certain ethnic groups within what was still a vast multinational Russian empire as inherently unreliable -- class enemies by dint of their nationality.'' This part of the terror was less important than the wider terror: ''persecuted nationalities accounted for around a fifth of all political arrests,'' but, Ferguson adds, ''more than a third of all executions.''
 Ferguson's best passages are his damning but entertaining narration of the naive, self-regarding and sinister folly of Anglo-French appeasement: ''Our enemies are little worms,'' Hitler said. ''I saw them at Munich.'' Ferguson argues that the Western powers should have gone to war in 1938, which would most likely have avoided much of the horror of World War II, or Britain and France could have forged an alliance with Stalin as a deterrent. He is undoubtedly correct, but this is simply omniscient hindsight: at the time, Stalin probably regarded the West as his chief enemy, while many in the West regarded barbaric Bolshevism as theirs. Moreover, it's questionable if public opinion would really have tolerated war in 1938. Still, Ferguson is certainly right that ''Stalin's policy of trusting Hitler was a calamitous blunder without equal in the history of the 20th century.''
 The book's poignant heart is the Holocaust, which Ferguson rightly calls ''the first and only industrialized genocide.'' It stands without parallel as the most wicked act in all history: ''Other regimes had perpetrated mass murder. ... Yet there was something qualitatively different about the Nazis' war against the Jews and the other unfortunate minorities they considered to be 'unworthy of life.' It was the fact that it was carried out by such well-educated people ... perpetrated under the leadership of a man who had come to power by primarily democratic means. The Nazi death machine worked economically, scientifically and euphemistically. ... It was very, very modern.'' 
 And Ferguson never loses sight of the Holocaust's human horror. He quotes the SS officer Kurt Gerstein describing a scene at Belzec: ''The train arrives. Two hundred Ukrainians fling open the doors and chase people out of the wagons with their leather whips. ... Then the procession starts to move. They all go along the path with a very pretty girl in front, all naked. ... They enter the death chambers. ... The corpses are thrown out wet with sweat and urine, smeared with excrement and menstrual blood on their legs. ... Two dozen dentists open mouths with hooks and look for gold. ... Some of the workers check genitals and anus for gold, diamonds and valuables.''
 The 20th-century ''war of the world'' ended, Ferguson argues, with the conclusion of the Korean War in 1953, though as he says, it is ''absurd for us to remember the cold war fondly as a time of peace and stability'' when ''between 1945 and 1983 around 19 or 20 million people were killed in around 100 major military conflicts.'' Now, with the cold war over, ''it is China,'' Ferguson says, ''that is the rising power.'' But his real conclusion is a warning to the West. We must study the 20th century, he insists, because in different ways, it could all happen again: ''We shall avoid another century of conflict only if we understand the forces that caused the last one -- the dark forces that conjure up ethnic conflict and imperial rivalry out of economic crisis, and in doing so negate our common humanity. They are forces that stir within us still.

HEADLINE: Senor Gross Out

BYLINE: By Jack Hitt. 
Jack Hitt is a contributing writer. His last article for the magazine was about the search for the ivory-billed woodpecker.

 BODY:
One of the highest-grossing movies in the history of Spanish cinema is Torrente 2,'' the 2001 sequel to the 1998 gross-out movie ''Torrente,'' which is not nearly as gross as the grossest movie of them all, last year's ''Torrente 3,'' which is real gross, even though it didn't gross as much as ''Torrente 2.'' 
Americans like to think we own the modern gross genre because we popularized it with ''Animal House,'' the ''American Pie'' franchise, various productions by the Farrelly brothers, the ''Jackass'' oeuvre and the animated movies of Matt Stone and Trey Parker. But gross has gone global, and the American gross-out industry may be heading the way of Detroit automobiles -- an old-economy product whose manufacturers are unaware that foreign competition is passing them by on matters of cheapness, innovation and potential crossover appeal. The story of the globalization of gross-out is not just another business yarn about American cultural exports. It is also the story of the self-made director of the ''Torrente'' series, a 41-year-old Spaniard named Santiago Segura. He grew up in an impoverished district of Madrid, taught himself how to use a super-8 camera and shot his early movies on the street, guerrilla-style, with expired film he bought on the cheap. ''Torrente 2'' pulled in $28 million at the box office in Spain, a phenomenal sum by the standards of a country with a population one-seventh that of the United States and a land mass that could be easily nestled inside Texas with more than enough room left over for Portugal. Segura, who also stars in his movies, is one of the biggest celebrities in Spain, and he is famous in other Spanish-speaking countries as well. ''The only person I've ever been out with who was approached like Santiago,'' his friend John Landis, the director, told me, ''is John Belushi, or maybe Michael Jackson.'' 
 But like all foreign comedians, Segura can't help noticing the American market, where gross receipts can run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. What European comic can watch the success of the Italian comedian Roberto Benigni here in the United States -- he won a Best Actor Oscar for ''Life Is Beautiful'' -- and not dream? The question is, Can a foreign comic break into Hollywood by reimporting new-and-improved gross-out back to the land of its birth? 
 To understand the potential of Segura, it is crucial to understand the magnitude of grossness of the character he plays. Torrente bumbles his way through everything he does, managing to offend or gross out everyone around him. (Yet he always, in the end, saves the day.) Marry Inspector Clouseau with the sensibility of the ''Aristocrats'' joke and you come close to the mise en scene of Torrente. Americans have a long and intimate affection for grossness in the cinematic form. Who doesn't get choked up thinking about that scene in ''Animal House'' when John Belushi does his famous zit impression by blasting what appears to be a mouthful of mashed potatoes all over the jock and his girlfriend? We get dewy-eyed thinking about Jim Carrey's talking buttocks in ''Ace Ventura'' and overtaken with sentimentality recalling Cameron Diaz and the hair-gel moment in ''There's Something About Mary.'' How about the pool bit in ''Caddyshack,'' when Bill Murray and that Baby Ruth bar are momentarily misunderstood? (Wait, wait. One more: The vomit scene in ''Team America.'') And yet, once you have experienced ''Torrente,'' you will look back at those scenes as quaintly innocent, like the yearbook shot of your high-school haircut. Segura's character is an unrelenting firehose of grossness, just as his name implies. He is a failed policeman, presumably fired from the force years ago for reasons that are all too easy to imagine. He is a racist, a fascist, a sexist, a gay-basher, a hater of foreigners, a pig, an idiot, a pervert -- for starters.
 Experts in gross, like 15-year-old boys, will tell you that high-quality gross-out centers on the horror we all share as existential inmates of the human body, particularly the common nightmare of contending with the escaping solids, fluids and gases required to keep it running. Flatulence is a staple of gross because, experts agree, it's always funny. Torrente relies on this comic styling a lot, as either a kicker to a good scene, punctuation to a solemn remark or the equivalent of a howdy-do. A mighty wind, though, is just the beginning of basic gross-out, and Santiago Segura is the Hieronymus Bosch of gross. The big picture is impressive enough, but for the connoisseur, it's all in the details. 
 Take hair. Torrente is bald -- but not just bald. He has a comb-over. But not just a comb-over. He hasn't bathed in weeks, so the comb-over is matted. But it's not just matted; he's also sweating most of the time, so in almost every scene the viewer must endure his stringy, clumpy comb-over draped like a greasy black squid atop a dome of glistening skull skin. It's this attention to detail that impresses the American observer. 
 Then there is Torrente's body, which is fat. And yet fat doesn't really capture his physique. Segura gained as much as 80 pounds each time he played the role. This did not yield a nice, round middle-aged paunch. Instead, Torrente is doughy, a man with a pasty, pale (and hairy) stomach with the consistency of a half-filled bag of cottage cheese, somehow always in motion as if influenced by tidal forces. This gut is seen a lot, as when, in ''Torrente 3,'' he decides to get fit and, shirt off, gets all of it jiggling while strapped into the waist belt of a vibrating exercise machine. Then he lowers the belt to a suggestive level and begins to pant. 
 I arranged to meet Segura on a bright, lovely Madrid afternoon not long ago at a coffee shop near the Plaza de Espana. It was rush hour, and we both stood waiting for each other for five minutes or so among crowded tables near zooming boulevard traffic. He didn't know what I looked like, and I was unprepared for a non-Torrente Segura. In reality, Segura is a nice-looking guy who is in fact bald but has grown his side hair to the cocky length of a freshly tenured comp-lit professor. He was wearing an orange Fred Flintstone T-shirt, complete with a printed blue tie. 
 Despite his many chameleon variations, his status as Spanish superstar is never in doubt. As we strolled down the Gran Via talking, no question from me was even half-answered before someone would jump up from a cafe table to ask for an autograph. There's a twist, though: Segura's fans, when they see him, are in the habit of calling out the most notorious catchphrase from his movies. In all three of the ''Torrente'' movies, the character finds himself on a stakeout with a newbie cop and explains that an old detective tradition involves masturbating each other in a car, adding that of course this doesn't make them gay. The phrase that Segura uses as his invitation has so permeated daily Spanish culture that occasionally a cellphone will go off, and instead of a ring, you'll hear Torrente's voice making his obscene request. And let's just say that when you're wandering the streets of Madrid with a celebrity at 2 a.m., it's a disconcerting greeting to hear from a mob of Spaniards cheerfully bolting from a bar.
 Comedy is a nightmare to translate, isn't it? Think about how much easier it is to be a straight dramatic actor who is beautiful, like Penelope Cruz or Antonio Banderas. Good looks, like wildlife programming on public television, can easily make the jump from one culture to another. But comedy, as Sir Donald Wolfit told us, is hard. ''Bruce Almighty'' and ''Meet the Parents'' were monster hits in Spain, but according to Segura, Adam Sandler can't get any traction. Now consider how difficult it is to jump the other way. When was the last time you read the phrase ''The hilarious new comedy from Germany!''? British comedy sometimes makes the leap, as in the ''Pink Panther'' movies or ''Monty Python,'' but in other cases (Rowan Atkinson) it remains incomprehensible to Americans. The sophisticated comedies of Pedro Almodovar cross over because the United States has an art-house culture that seeks them out. Torrente is very much a universal character, but he is also deeply enmeshed in the Spanish experience, a washout from the long-ago Fascism of Francisco Franco. And despite their wild success in Spain, the ''Torrente'' films have never had American theatrical distribution beyond the occasional festival screening. DVDs are available, but I had to work the South Korean corners of eBay to find them. 
 ''I don't really think that much about getting into the American market,'' Segura said, but it was clear that this was not true. New Line Cinema has optioned the rights to the Torrente character, though Segura knows that if an American version is ever made, he is not likely to play the lead. (The name Jack Black is kicking around in casting circles.) 
 For someone who insists that he's not thinking about America, Segura can also suddenly volunteer, ''I'd be happy to get a small part on 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' or play a waiter on 'The Sopranos' or a doorman in a Martin Scorsese movie.'' And it would be hard to find another person in Spain, or even Europe, who is more familiar with our culture. Late one afternoon, he invited me to his apartment on the Gran Via to watch some of his favorite clips. His place is pretty modest in size for a superstar, but it has its amenities. His plush bed has a button next to it that automatically raises a shade on a large picture window with a sweeping vista of Madrid's rooftops centered on a view of the Palacio Real, the official home of King Juan Carlos. But it's hard to see the bed, or the walls, or in fact any flat surface at all because there are thousands of DVDs, CDs, old VHS tapes, novels, magazines and comic books stacked up everywhere. It would seem that there is no American film that's not here -- screwball Cary Grant comedies, compilations of early Eddie Murphy stand-up and Chris Farley ''Saturday Night Live'' skits, the latest DVDs with Vince Vaughn or Owen Wilson. A set of shelves plopped in the middle of the room spills over with the stuff. Open boxes bursting with new films sit here and there. We snaked our way through the labyrinth to his sofa. After clearing off still more DVDs, we sat down before a wide-screen TV, itself a base for another Dr. Seuss-like tower of videos. Segura can quote his favorite comics, chapter and verse. He plugged in some Steve Martin, a magic bit from an ancient ''Tonight Show'' in which Martin, as the Great Flydini, keeps pulling things out of his zipper -- a handkerchief, some eggs, eventually a phone ringing with a call for him. 
 ''Steve Martin is my hero,'' Segura said. ''I just read in an interview that he collects art. He collects Pablo Picasso.'' He puckered his entire face into an expression of comic humility. ''Have I shown you my Snoopy originals?'' 
 Actually, what's hanging on his walls, sitting on the shelves and stacked in shipping crates, waiting to be framed, is a hip curator's museum of American visual ephemera. Original artwork by Gahan Wilson, Al Hirschfeld, R. Crumb, Frank Frazetta and a dozen New Yorker cartoonists, as well as original images of Prince Valiant, Tarzan, Little Annie Fanny and Wicked Wanda, not to mention early panels by some of MAD Magazine's illustrators -- Don Martin, Mort Drucker (who did those movie parodies) and Jack Davis. Segura confessed that he often sat late into the night at his computer, bidding for these specific pieces of American arcana in private Internet auctions and on eBay. He grabbed my arm and whisked me out the apartment to the elevator. ''You have to see this,'' he said. We traveled a few floors away to his production office. 
 ''Do you know who Drew Struzan is?'' he asked. I didn't, but he wasn't really waiting for my answer. ''He did the posters for 'Star Wars' and 'Back to the Future.' '' He pushed open a heavy door, thick as a bank vault, and swept his hand in front of him like a game-show supermodel to indicate the original artwork for the poster of ''Torrente 3.'' Sure enough, in the fish-eye perspective of Torrente's gut and the fiery amber colors of the explosions in the background, you can see the same hand that painted the poster art for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.''
 Segura crossed his arms over his chest, luxuriating in the covert pleasure of seeing his Torrente directly linked to Indiana Jones. ''For me,'' Segura said, ''I'm done.''
 Four years ago, Segura almost became the next Roberto Benigni. He received a call from a producer named Fernando Sulichin. ''He said he was a big fan of the 'Torrente' series and said, 'You have to do a movie with me,' '' Segura told me. ''I thought he was crazy. He did all this name dropping. He would say, 'Martin' and mean Martin Scorsese. I was talking about 'The King of Comedy,' one of my favorite movies, and I said, 'I wish that movie had come out on DVD.' He said, 'I think it is out on DVD,' and then he said, 'Let me call Martin.' For me, it was like a fairy tale. He called right there and said, 'You're right, it's not out on DVD, but it will be.' ''
 Soon enough, Segura was on a plane to Hollywood. The movie that Sulichin had cast him in was called ''R.V.'' (not to be confused with the Robin Williams vehicle). ''I was living the Hollywood fantasy,'' Segura told me. ''I got a script. I was the star. It was about a Spanish guy who went to a place in the South where there are a lot of R.V.s.'' Scarlett Johansson was mentioned as a possible co-star, as was Jack Palance. 
 Segura managed to make a few well-placed friends during his stay in Los Angeles. Another director introduced him to Landis, who directed ''Animal House'' and ''The Blues Brothers.'' Sulichin introduced him to Oliver Stone, who tried to option the ''Torrente'' franchise. (The deal fell apart because ''Santiago was as despicable a person as he was onscreen,'' Stone joked.) Segura is always eager to collaborate with those he admires; he gave Landis a cameo in ''Torrente 3'' as an Arab diplomat, and Stone appeared in the same film, briefly, as a drunken British soccer thug. The ''R.V.'' production was no exception. ''There was a part in the script that called for a midget who is selling Viagra in the R.V. camping sites,'' Segura told me. ''I suggested my favorite film-score composer, Paul Williams'' -- who is in fact quite short. Williams, who wrote the music for ''Bugsy Malone'' and ''The Muppet Movie,'' agreed to do it.
 ''Then Paul Williams said to me, 'Maybe you and I can write some music for the movie,' '' Segura recalled. ''I thought it was all a dream.'' 
 This being Hollywood, soon enough it all was. The film lost its financing, and Segura was busted back to struggling-foreign-actor-in-Hollywood (a remote suburb of casting hell), scraping for character bits and fetching cameos. ''In Spanish we have a saying,'' he told me. ''El mundo es un panuelo -- 'The world is a handkerchief.' It means the same as 'It's a small world.' '' For Segura,it meant that his old and new friends in Hollywood tossed him enough small parts to keep afloat. At one point he played the gross manager of a seedy hotel in ''Tiptoes,'' acting alongside Kate Beckinsale, Matthew McConaughey and Gary Oldman. ''I get beat up by Patricia Arquette in that movie,'' Segura proudly reported. ''She really pounds on me.'' 
 In fact, chances are pretty good that you are already familiar with the work of Santiago Segura, however fleetingly. He was with Oliver Stone during the filming of ''Comandante,'' which was built around interviews Stone conducted in Cuba. Santiago can be seen lurking, Zelig-like, in the scenes with Castro. Certain directors like to hire him, like Guillermo del Toro (no relation to the actor Benicio del Toro). After they met more than 10 years ago at Sitges, a horror-film festival held near Barcelona, Segura and del Toro become good buddies. ''He's the one who showed me eBay,'' Segura confessed. He went on to say: ''Guillermo said to me that it would cost him more to hire a mediocre comic actor in Hollywood than it would to hire any of the biggest comedians in Europe.'' Even a top Spanish star cast in a Spanish film will earn no more than about $250,000. Segura, in other words, works cheap. So his panuelo roles range from the bad guy in ''Agent Cody Banks 2'' to the bad guy in ''Blade 2,'' in which he plays the thug who escapes the first slaughter only to get whacked, horribly, in the final mayhem so that the film wraps up with that tidy-bow-on-top-of-the-gore feeling. ''Hellboy'' fans may recall the scene in which Ron Perlman's lovable demon is chasing that Alien-like monster down the tracks of the New York subway. The creature spies a departing train, leaps aboard, rips open the door and shoves the conductor (Segura) aside before racing through the car. Perlman then leaps onto the train, and Segura mistakes him and his sawed-off horns for another invading monster. Like any good New York civil servant, Segura's conductor clonks the beast on the head with a fire extinguisher, which sends him plunging beneath the train. 
 John Landis and Oliver Stone remain friends and admirers of Segura's. ''Torrente is Don Quixote,'' Landis explained, ''without the nobility.'' Stone told me, with a hint of jealousy in his voice: ''Torrente is just outrageous. He is just so immoral. Anything that is despicable, he does. And he doesn't do it because he is malicious. He's just a fundamentally despicable human being. In comedy, you poke fun at pretentiousness and normality. Torrente makes fun of everything we find legitimate and respectable.''
 Over the phone, Stone guffawed. ''One of my favorite scenes,'' he said, ''is when this poor guy comes to Torrente and says he's brokenhearted about his wife. He wants Torrente to track her down because he thinks she's cheating on him. And of course, Torrente goes and finds her working in a whorehouse. He uses that to force her to sleep with him, and then he insists on taking all her money. He walks out of the apartment, and the poor slob of a husband is there crying and says, 'What did you find out?' He lies to the guy, tells him everything is fine, and then takes his money. It's just completely immoral.''
 One night over dinner, Segura told me, ''Torrente is everything I hate about my country all in one place.'' And this uncompromising quality to his character may be precisely why American directors admire Torrente; they never get to go this far. American grossness or offensiveness is often eased in the end by some kind of redemption. Homer Simpson may be a selfish slob, but he actually does love his family. Chris Farley's Tommy Boy and Jack Black's ''School of Rock'' guy and Adam Sandler's Billy Madison all have their hearts in the right place. In order to make it O.K. for us to laugh at all the fat jokes and cringe-worthy sex humiliations, there must be something redemptive in the character. 
 Torrente is redemption-free.
 ''I have thought about how to make Torrente work in America,'' Segura said. ''You would have to change some things. My only advice to anyone writing it is, do not shy away from being rough. Be brutal. Whatever you don't like about America, you put in Torrente.'' 
 Will New Line, say, go that far? It's hard to imagine. The American Torrente would have to have a soft side. He will be allowed to pass all the gas he wants so long as he loves his mother. 
 Landis has his own thoughts on the matter. ''If I were doing an American version of Torrente, I would cast Santiago and make him a Hispanic cop who comes to us. They do this all the time. Arnold Schwarzenegger played a Soviet cop who comes to Chicago to work with Jim Belushi in 'Red Heat.' It's called 'fish out of water,' and it's the second most common theme after 'boy meets girl.' I would cast Santiago and surround him with great people and fantastic situations. Now, will they do that? Absolutely not. They'll go with whom they presume will deliver the opening weekend.'' 
 If ''Torrente'' makes Santiago Segura famous in Hollywood, he knows it will probably be as a producer or a writer, not as an actor (although he said he'd like to at least have a cameo in his own franchise). Not that he thinks about being famous here as an actor. No, of course not. Never crossed his mind.
 ''I did have this one other idea,'' he ventured, over dessert. ''It's a wager movie, like 'Trading Places' or 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.' I love wager movies. The pitch is these two older gigolos sitting in a country-club restaurant. They are having an argument about whether seducing a woman is a gift you are born with or a talent you can learn. The two men are, like, Burt Reynolds and George Hamilton. Reynolds is arguing that it can be taught. Hamilton says it's innate. Reynolds looks across the way at a janitor cleaning the floor and bets Hamilton he can teach him to seduce the most beautiful woman in the place. In time, of course, he does, and then both the janitor and Reynolds actually fall in love with this woman. But it starts with the two gigolos looking at this janitor and shaking hands over this wager. The camera comes in close on the guy mopping. He turns, and it's me.''

 BODY:
He didn't talk much the first day. He didn't talk much the second day. As I understand it, he doesn't talk much most days. But in our 48 hours together, Christopher Guest showed me his childhood, fell in love -- with a guitar -- and even did comedy. With me as the straight man.
On our second day, as he sat on a couch at Mandolin Brothers, the venerable guitar store on Staten Island and the kind of mecca for him that Harry Winston is for Elizabeth Taylor, I also saw an aspect of how he makes the movies he directs, writes and acts in. He held his newest object of affection, what he called a ''bizarre combination of a Gibson body and a National neck,'' and in front of him stood Stan Jay, the store's owner, wearing a blue shirt printed with yellow half moons and clouds. ''My wife makes all my shirts,'' he told Guest proudly. ''She has her own company, Bea Jay Jeans, because her name is Beatrice Jay. See?'' He showed Guest the label. 
 Guest nodded and Jay kept going, and the more intently Guest listened, the more earnestly Jay spoke, and it was a shame there was no camera, because while it looked as if Guest were only strumming a guitar, murmuring, ''Is that so?'' he was just as surely shaping a character who was delivering the monologue of his life. Like every character in a Christopher Guest movie, Jay had his dreams, albeit small ones: he wanted Guest to buy a guitar (he bought the banjo here that he learned to play for ''A Mighty Wind''); and he wanted him to visit the guys downstairs in the repair shop. Done and done.
 In Guest's films, beloved by so many that they can recite the lines by heart, his characters also have dreams, though grander and harder to realize. In ''Waiting for Guffman,'' the citizens of Blaine, Mo., want their community-theater production to move to Broadway; in ''Best in Show,'' a variety of dog owners push their pooches to win top prize at a Westminster-like show; in ''A Mighty Wind,'' three folk acts whose 15 minutes of fame expired 35 years earlier get a crack at a comeback; in ''This Is Spinal Tap,'' which was directed by Rob Reiner and written by Guest, Michael McKean, Harry Shearer and Reiner, washed-up rockers give a doomed comeback tour their all.
 Like the writer and director Preston Sturges (''The Palm Beach Story,'' ''The Lady Eve''), whose wacky characters cherish their American dreams as lofty as building an airport suspended over a city or as low as cheating at cards, Guest has respect and affection for the oddballs he creates. No matter how absurd their circumstances, he always takes them seriously, which only makes them funnier. Their wrenching heartbreaks and tiny triumphs make them exactly like us.
 His latest film, ''For Your Consideration,'' a scathing sendup of award-season hype that opens on Friday, employs his usual repertory of actors -- McKean, Shearer, Eugene Levy (who has co-written most of Guest's films), Parker Posey, Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara, among them. Guest's movies take months to write, as he and Levy painstakingly develop characters and plot. In ''Consideration,'' the unlikely Oscar candidate is the independent film ''Home for Purim,'' a hokey melodrama about a Southern-Jewish family in the 1940s and a dying mother's reconciliation with her lesbian daughter. Guest and Levy conceived the film-within-the-film to be written by two self-important hacks (played by McKean and Bob Balaban), community-college professors whose pretensions and limitations were explored so completely that Guest and Levy even wrote the titles for 27 of the fictional duo's plays. As in all Guest films, the parts were created with each actor in mind. When the outlines were finished, the actors offered input into their characters' costumes, cars, even the set designs for their homes. Then they improvised their dialogue.
 ''By that point, Gene and I have written hundreds of cards delineating what happens in every scene,'' Guest told me. ''We have no rehearsal, just turn on the camera and people start talking.'' (In the new film, the ''Home for Purim'' scenes are scripted).
 Guest, who is 58, discussed ''For Your Consideration'' on our first day together at the Carlyle Hotel. He had flown in from the Toronto Film Festival and, because his room wasn't ready, was given a suite for his interview. It was surprising to discover that he has white hair, though when you stop to think about it, it's hard to pinpoint what Guest really looks like. He has appeared in all but the first of his films, ''The Big Picture,'' which starred Kevin Bacon, and he is such a chameleon -- in ''Consideration,'' he plays Jay Berman, the director of ''Home for Purim,'' as an arty slob with a cartoonish haircut -- that it was disconcerting to find him tall and slim, polite and dignified. He barely cracked a smile for the better part of two days, so the web of fine lines around his slate blue eyes was unexpected. He must laugh sometime.
 What he did do was speak in a variety of accents and deliver countless impressions, including one of his father, distinguished and distant; George Burns, whispery and hair-raisingly accurate; and Alan Arkin, a voice Guest describes as ''impatiently intelligent'' (and very New York). It became clear that Guest's primary way of experiencing the world is through sound. He seems to carry thousands of voices in his head, and each reveals an almost eerily realized character. The character that is Christopher Guest -- smart, dry, fiercely emotional about his family and work and just as fiercely hidden -- prefers a back seat, especially when he has the chance to praise his repertory company.
 ''A reporter once asked, 'Is there someone you wish you could get on these movies?' '' Guest recalled, settling on the couch. ''I think in the back of his mind was, 'This poor guy, he can't get Angelina Jolie.' And of course, these are the most talented people at what they do walking the earth.''
 It was the Hollywood-star mentality, in all its magnified seventh-grade glory, that drove Guest to make ''For Your Consideration.'' 
 ''People have said to me, 'Gee, a guy in the dry cleaner said I should get an Academy Award for that thing I did,' '' Guest said. '' 'And you know, it was pretty good.' And I say, 'Well, maybe you shouldn't go to that dry cleaner.' ''
 Guest's first nomination of any kind was for an Obie Award for music he wrote with Paul Jacobs for the Off Broadway show ''National Lampoon's Lemmings,'' in 1973. He never did find out if they won, he said, because the category was omitted during the ceremony. Then he and other Lampoon writers were nominated for three Grammys for their comedy records. ''The first year, Cheech and Chong won,'' Guest said. ''Second year, Richard Pryor. Third year, Richard Pryor. And I thought, This isn't fun at all.''
 In 1976 he won an Emmy for writing a Lily Tomlin special, and he eventually did win a Grammy, in 2004, with Eugene Levy and Michael McKean, for the title song of ''A Mighty Wind.'' ''I was struck by what happens to your psyche being nominated, the disruption of it,'' Guest said. ''But the reason I don't look at this as just a movie about Hollywood is this could happen in any world -- the Nobel Prize or the Booker Prize, anything -- where people are in such a delicate state in terms of their esteem that there is no way to process the information.''
 When he acts, Guest creates a character starting with the voice, an obsession he honed growing up in New York City, where he spent his free time in the bathroom. ''There was some echo with the tile, so I could practice voices,'' he said. When his parents took him out to dinner, he would listen to a waiter recite the specials, then order in the waiter's voice, to the dismay of his father, Lord Peter Haden-Guest, then editorial director of the United Nations, and his mother, Jean Haden-Guest, the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants who was a vice president of casting and talent at CBS. Guest grew up in Greenwich Village and went to the Little Red School House, P.S. 41 and the High School of Music and Art. After two years there, he left for the Stockbridge School in Massachusetts, where he played in Arlo Guthrie's band and auditioned for the School of the Arts at N.Y.U.
 ''I did one of George's monologues from 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' '' Guest said and sighed. ''You know when you're young you have this unbelievable stupidity and arrogance and ignorance all mixed in? Of course, it was meant to be done by a 50-year-old man. There was a panel of people, and someone said, 'Are you willing to give your blood for the theater?' And I thought, Wow, you know what? I don't think so. I thought maybe there'd be some cute women, maybe in the acting class. What do you mean give my blood?
 ''So I went to Bard College for a year. And then, even though I didn't think I should give my blood to the theater, I did go to N.Y.U., which is where I met Michael McKean. In my second year I auditioned for 'Little Murders,' which Alan Arkin was directing at Circle in the Square, and got a part.'' Also in the cast were Fred Willard and Paul Benedict, another member of Guest's repertory. (Guest kept working and eventually left school.) Although his real name is Christopher Haden-Guest, he changed it after an audition. ''The director read the name aloud, he did this'' -- Guest made a face -- ''and said, 'That's a good one.' And I said, 'That's actually my name.' This speaks to my level of security at the time. I thought it sounded pretentious to them, so I dropped that part of it.'' 
 Even so, when his father died in 1996, Guest succeeded to his title, becoming the fifth Baron Haden-Guest of Saling in the county of Essex. His wife of 22 years, Jamie Lee Curtis, is Lady Haden-Guest. (Although his half-brother from his father's first marriage, the writer Anthony Haden-Guest, is older, he was not eligible, having been born out of wedlock.)
 ''Jamie calls the House of Lords 'the lord thing,' which is just right,'' Guest said. ''I actually went for a few years, before they kicked the hereditary peers out. My first day there I was lost. The corridors all look the same. The third time I go around, I see the same guard, who says, 'Perhaps my lord would like a compass.' With just a little smile on his face. That was worth the whole thing. I thought, Now we can go home.'' But not before Curtis visited the gift shop and loaded up on barbecue aprons, oven mitts and matches, all with the House of Lords insignia. +
 Guest stood, ready to check into his own room. ''People ask me, 'What's your next film?' And I never know,'' he said. ''I truly don't have an idea now, and it may take another year before I do. There seems to be some organic inner timing where I need the time off. That's the way it's always been.''
 Which is fine with Martin Shafer, chairman and C.E.O. of Castle Rock Entertainment -- the company that has produced all of Guest's films since ''Guffman.'' ''Chris is not at all obsessed with himself or his movies,'' Shafer said by phone. ''He's whatever the opposite of egotistical is. We've done 100 movies, and on each opening day I'm on the phone with the director giving the grosses. I ask Chris, 'You want me to call you tonight and tell you how it did?' And he says, 'No, we can talk next week.'
 ''Some of the films will do better, some will do worse,'' Shafer continued. ''But he's creating a body of work that's exceptional. He's also an economic filmmaker who doesn't go a penny over. If he says $8 million, it's $8 million. If he says the shoot is 24 days, it's not 25 days. He has total control, and he never abuses that.''
 Inside the elevator stood an elegant woman holding a small dog, and the elevator operator. Guest put his hand out, and the dog licked it effusively, in spasms of glee.
 ''Oh, well,'' Guest said and hung his saturated hand out to dry while the elevator operator tried not to laugh. The woman insisted, ''It's O.K, he's clean.'' I started to laugh. The door opened on his floor, and Guest turned to me, extending his hand, shiny with dog spit. He looked me straight in the eye, deadpan, and with the slightest lift of his eyebrow, pulled me into the joke. In that wordless moment he seemed more entirely present and connected than he had been in any of the 90 minutes that preceded it. I could see by his expression that the moment was also mine to refuse, no harm done. I clasped his hand firmly and he stifled his smile, muttering pleasantries, and got out. As the door closed behind him, both the woman and the elevator operator looked embarrassed for me, stupid enough to have taken his soiled hand, and kept their eyes on the floor. The dog, however, panted at me eagerly. He smelled his friend.
 The next day, at Mandolin Brothers, Guest said, ''I've been buying guitars since 1964, and you fool yourself into thinking it's the last one.'' He strummed. ''This is way too loud and way too good sounding.''
 Sitting beside him was David Nichtern, Guest's best friend since childhood. On their first day of nursery school, a bully threatened to beat up Nichtern and was beaten up by Guest instead. At 13, they started playing guitar together in Washington Square Park. Nichtern is a musician and composer who wrote the song ''Midnight at the Oasis.'' The two have a shorthand of baseball statistics, musical references, old jokes based on Guest's impressions and the kind of long, easy silences Guest treasures.
 They sat in what Guest called ''the grown-up room,'' for serious connoisseurs. Stan Jay brought out a succession of vintage guitars and mandolins, and as the two men played, customers peeked inside. Guest pretended not to notice. The previous day we talked about fame and how little he enjoys it. 
 ''My wife actually can't walk down the street without being recognized,'' he said. ''I can now, quite easily, but when I was on 'Saturday Night Live' in the mid '80s, I couldn't, and I didn't like it. Obviously, I'm not as comfortable as Jamie is. You'll turn around and she has her arms around three people and they're taking pictures and she's saying, 'No, I like to make it with more tomato sauce.' ''
 Curtis last starred in the movie ''Christmas With the Kranks,'' in 2004, and she has built a career as a best-selling children's-book author. So she and Guest both have to travel. ''I don't think I've ever been separated from Jamie for more than two weeks in 22 years,'' Guest said. ''That was always a rule, first as a couple, then as a family. And we've stuck to it.'' They have two adopted children, Annie, 19, and Tom, 10.
 I met with Curtis two weeks later at the Mark Hotel, while she was in New York to promote her latest book. Unlike Guest, who can be both ambling and perfunctory, Curtis gets straight to the point. I told her it was hard to imagine her reserved husband's relationship with her flamboyant father, the actor Tony Curtis. 
 ''He has none,'' she said bluntly. ''My father behaved badly once in front of Chris's family and my daughter on her ninth birthday, and my husband has not spoken to him since. Correctly, by the way.''
 While she's used to the fact that Guest doesn't talk or emote much, he can still crack her up. ''We go to a function, like a charity dinner, and he starts moaning just loud enough for me to hear,'' she said. ''And I'm trying so hard not to laugh.'' He is also, she says, an exceptionally kind person. ''He sends a handwritten letter to every actor he has to cut out of his movies, even with the tiniest part,'' she said. ''He respects that process so much, and he does it so lovingly.''
 While intimacy is not easy for Guest, Curtis added, ''he's never been more intimate than he is with his children, because children force you into it. Tom has a very vivid imagination, and with him Chris has invented an amalgam of characters from video and computer games, and they make up action-figure characters. Chris does the voice of every character. They have a fabulous time, it's beautiful.'' She smiled. ''We have a collection of New Yorker cartoons, and one is a dinner-table scene where the father is holding up a cooked chicken. And he says, 'Your mom cooks the chicken but your Dad makes it dance.' Chris can make a chicken dance.''
 It is that whimsy, tempered only by the insistence of human nature to exert itself, that characterizes Guest's films, which are a departure from his baser beginnings in comedy. In a skit in ''National Lampoon's Lemmings,'' he appeared as James Taylor and sang: ''Farewell New York City/With your streets that flash like strobes/Farewell Carolina/Where I left my frontal lobes.''
 He winced at the mention. ''James Taylor came to the show with Carly Simon, and she was laughing and he wasn't,'' he said. ''As a joke, it was a major cheap shot. They came backstage, and I was devastated, because he was such a hero to me. As a satirist you're not supposed to care about that. I guess what I'm doing now really represents who I am and always was. It just took a while to happen.''
 Meanwhile, Jay brought out more guitars for him and Nichtern to try, until Guest went back to the one he liked and they played bluegrass, side by side. The instruments were glorious, and the two men were swept up in the sound, the rush of playing they've been experiencing together for 45 years. Their energy soared with the music, and Guest kept his eyes closed in the swell of the moment, because this music, this moment, was his family, his passion, his history. The room was as packed with emotion, raw and exposed, as it possibly could be, and Guest didn't have to say a word. He should have smiled. Life was good.

HEADLINE: Funny Money

BYLINE: By Jon Gertner.

 BODY:
If you spend a week in Los Angeles asking Hollywood studio bosses what makes a comedy film successful these days, the conversations will most likely start off about art -- or, more precisely, about the art of humor. Production executives will explain that ''execution is everything.'' Or that ''perfect timing'' is what really matters. Or that ''chemistry'' between the cast and director is what truly makes things (they actually say ''magic'' sometimes) happen. But chances are the talk will turn into a discussion about money. Late one afternoon in September, just before dinner, that's the sort of conversation I had with Tom Rothman at his office on the 20th Century Fox lot. 
Rothman and his partner, Jim Gianopulos, serve as co-chairmen of Fox Filmed Entertainment; together, they have had an especially profitable run of comedies over the past few years, most recently including ''The Devil Wears Prada,'' which this year took in $125 million at the domestic box office. As Rothman put it, ''Comedies have been very good to us.'' To prove his point, he began rummaging through some low shelves outside his office that were cluttered with awards. They weren't Oscars but angular statuettes known as Gold Reels, given by a movie-tracking service, Nielsen EDI, to a studio when one of its films reaches $100 million in domestic box-office receipts. '' 'Dodgeball'!'' Rothman said triumphantly when he found the award for the movie, which starred Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. That one cost $18 million to make, he pointed out, and earned $114 million domestically. ''And here's 'Something About Mary,' '' he said, dusting off the inscription before handing me the bulky statuette. ''There's Something About Mary,'' which Rothman considers an early source for the style, appeal and eccentricity of contemporary Hollywood comedies, cost $20 million. It earned $176 million domestically. And it fared even better abroad, which is rare for a comedy, bringing in another $195 million.
To hear some studio heads tell it, comedies have been an unusually good business over the past few years, even as box-office revenues in general have languished. ''The world is grim, and comedy always plays as a healthy antidote to what's going on in the world,'' Matt Tolmach, a president of production at Sony Pictures, told me. This year, Sony had two big comedy hits with ''Click,'' starring Adam Sandler, and ''Talladega Nights,'' starring Will Ferrell. Tolmach also noted that we're in a cycle with an uncommonly high number of talented comedians and directors, which he regards as happenstance more than anything else. The success of Stiller, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn (all of whom, incidentally, share the same agency, United Talent, and all of whom now earn as much as $20 million a movie) recalls the 1980s, when an abundance of ''Saturday Night Live'' actors (many of whom shared the same manager, Bernie Brillstein) made the jump to films. Maybe the biggest difference, one film executive told me, ''is that now there are probably a lot less drugs involved.''
 When it comes to raw numbers, though, it's not so obvious that comedies are booming. According to Nielsen EDI, for instance, 145 different comedies took in $2.79 billion at the United States box office in 2003; the next year, 161 comedies made about $2.74 billion. And in 2005, 164 comedies again accounted for about $2.74 billion in domestic box-office revenues. Generally speaking, about 30 percent of total box-office revenue comes from comedies in a given year. So it would seem that things are holding steady, or perhaps even falling off a bit. The Nielsen figures, however, don't capture the renewed interest among Hollywood executives in producing comedies made on the cheap, including those that have helped turn Ferrell, Wilson and Vaughn into stars. This speaks to the difference between comedy revenue (the total amount of money taken in at the domestic and international box offices) and comedy profitability (the money left over after subtracting the costs of producing, marketing and distributing a film). To the studios, the potential profitability of a comedy is a far more important consideration than revenue. Indeed, it's the only statistic that really matters.
 Hollywood studio executives are called lots of things, many of them unprintable, but they are rarely described as what they really are: portfolio managers. They don't invest in companies, of course; they invest in movies -- a far more complex and risky endeavor, statistically speaking. But in many respects the differences end there. Essentially, the studio bosses spend a large part of their time thinking about how to manage risk. They diversify their movie portfolios -- their yearly ''slates,'' usually between 12 and 20 films -- by genre, mixing comedies, animated films, dramas and action movies. Then they diversify by cost, betting on some projects that cost $25 million and others that cost $150 million. And rather than finance all these movies themselves, they often team up with other studios, outside production companies and, more recently, Wall Street investors. Studios also shop for bargains at places like the Sundance Film Festival, figuring that they can transform a cheap purchase into a big hit by exploiting their marketing skills and vast distribution networks. That has been the case with ''Little Miss Sunshine,'' for instance, which Fox's Searchlight division bought for $10.5 million. To date, it has taken in nearly $60 million in the United States.
 Comedies don't necessarily produce higher revenues than other genres -- indeed, there are enough bombs every year (like Ben Stiller and Jack Black in ''Envy'') to suggest that, on average, a comedy earns a Gold Reel no more often than any other kind of film does. But comedies do tend to have lower physical production costs, since they often don't require extravagant sets or expensive postproduction work. And if they have low artistic production costs as well (for the cast and directors), they have a kind of jackpot potential that dramas, at least in recent years, have lacked. In other words, even when a comedy doesn't produce the huge revenues of a blockbuster like ''Harry Potter,'' it can help push the returns of a portfolio way up if it is put together in a way similar to ''Little Miss Sunshine'' or ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin,'' which starred an inexpensive and untested Steve Carell. Such a film will pay off in the theater, on DVD, in television sales -- and ultimately contribute to the studio's catalog. A popular comedy is a valuable piece of intellectual property. If it's made cheaply, it's the equivalent of investing early in Google.
 ''People think it should be easy, but it isn't,'' says Harold Vogel, a longtime entertainment-industry analyst. In part that's because creating a financial hit isn't just a matter of getting good scripts or finding up-and-coming stars; it's also the challenge of successfully marketing a new product to choosy and often skeptical audiences. Some recent comedies -- ''Wedding Crashers'' and ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin,'' for example -- have had a broad, mass-audience appeal. But the studios often think of the comedy market, and thus their comedy products, in narrower terms: romantic comedies, road-trip comedies, spoofs, ''dramedies'' and the like. In fact, studio chiefs make a concentrated effort to match specific kinds of comedies with specific demographic groups, especially young men. This may explain the existence (and, to some extent, the popularity) of a film like ''Jackass Number Two,'' as well as the inevitability of a ''Jackass Number Three.'' Indeed, the franchise's financial viability -- ''Jackass Number Two'' cost less than $12 million to make -- and demographic sweet spot suggest it may go on indefinitely, perhaps until a freak accident obliterates the entire gang in ''Jackass: The Final Wipeout.''
 When I made the rounds in Los Angeles earlier this fall, ''Jackass Number Two'' had just opened strongly for Paramount, burying ''All the King's Men,'' a period drama starring Sean Penn. Gail Berman, the president of Paramount, seemed elated. Not long after she started her job in May 2005, Berman told Variety that her plans for the studio were simple: ''Comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy.'' When I met with her at Paramount, she explained that the lack of comedies in development when she arrived led her to push for the quick greenlighting of ''Jackass Number Two'' and ''Nacho Libre,'' the Jack Black comedy. ''Nacho Libre'' proved to have a strong family appeal. But both projects were largely created with the under-25 male demographic in mind, and with an eye on strong DVD sales to those same young men. And her next priority, Berman told me, was to try to recreate her studio's success with a romantic, star-driven comedy like ''Failure to Launch,'' which starred Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker and took in $88 million domestically. Or to put it another way, she wanted to score a hit with a different market segment -- female audiences.
 ''Jackass Number Two'' represents a financial approach to comedy that you might call the penny-stock comedy model. Paramount isn't the only studio that now relies on this strategy. When I visited Fox's studios, for instance, Tom Rothman's team had just spent the summer revving up the marketing machine for ''Borat,'' which was already creating a stir in town, even among jaded movie execs. That movie cost just $17 million. Meanwhile, the studio was also laying the groundwork for the release of ''Night at the Museum,'' a special-effects-heavy comedy starring Ben Stiller (with Robin Williams, Paul Rudd, Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney and a cameo by Owen Wilson), which had been in development at Fox for 10 years and which cost $110 million, a sum that does not include marketing and distribution costs. You might call ''Museum'' the blue-chip comedy model.
 I asked Rothman to predict how the two films would do. Studio chiefs worry privately about every opening weekend; bombs, like blockbusters, can come out of nowhere. Yet the chiefs never display a lack of public enthusiasm for coming releases. On ''Museum,'' which will open just before Christmas, Rothman was blithe. He had attended some test screenings and told me that as a result he was utterly confident the film would do well. ''I know it's a smash, and I know the audience will love it,'' he declared. He also predicted that it would travel well and make a substantial profit: ''I'll tell you, I'll be shocked if whatever that movie does domestically, it doesn't do 150 percent of that internationally.'' In other words, if the film takes in $150 million domestically -- a hypothetical amount, since it could do far better or far worse -- it would earn another $225 million worldwide.
 And what about ''Borat''? Rothman sighed. It was still six weeks before the film would open, on Nov. 3, and he thought it would do well, but he could not forecast how well. ''As a matter of fact, I could predict the ultimate gross of 'Borat' probably less well than any movie we have for the rest of the year.'' Rothman noted that he and Gianopulos would never make ''Borat'' for the price of ''Night at the Museum,'' but the fact that Fox could do ''Borat'' at a modest cost made it worth putting into production. Rothman then raised the issue of whether the studios had lost their appetite for taking chances. ''That's actually not true at all, in my opinion,'' he told me. ''Borat'' was the kind of risk worth taking, he added, ''which means you have to be willing to risk failure.'' And yet ''Borat'' seemed more of a creative risk than a financial risk. The film didn't cost much by Hollywood standards, and expectations around town were so high that every studio executive I spoke with -- every executive, that is, except Rothman -- seemed to think it would be tremendously profitable. For Fox, that would make it a very safe bet indeed.
 When it works, the penny-stock model for comedies highlights the savvy of studio executives in a way a blue-chip picture can't. Anyone can spend large sums on stars, computer-generated effects and then marketing and distribution, but not everyone can conjure profits so resourcefully. One of the visionaries of this approach is Tom Pollock of the Montecito Picture Company, a partnership between Pollock and the director Ivan Reitman. When he described his projects to me, Pollock made the business sound simple: find a good script, pick an undiscovered star or anonymous acting ensemble, get a good but not expensive director and run a tight ship while filming. ''Road Trip,'' which Montecito produced for DreamWorks in 2000, was a model for this kind of film. The idea behind it -- four characters go on a raucous drive from Ithaca, N.Y., to Austin, Tex., to save a romantic relationship -- was generated internally at Montecito, but Pollock didn't have a script or a director. Then Ivan Reitman's son, Jason, who is also a director, noticed a documentary at the Sundance Film Festival called ''Frat House,'' by Todd Phillips (and Andrew Gurland); he suggested his father and Pollock take a look, too. ''We saw it and thought, Here's the guy who really gets the joke,'' Pollock told me. So Montecito hired Phillips to direct, and Phillips in turn wrote a script (with Scot Armstrong) for the lowest rate allowed by the screenwriters' union. After multiple drafts, it seemed promising enough for DreamWorks to put it into production.
 Pollock, a former studio chief at Universal, points out that you probably can't make a great action picture for $25 million. But you can be funny on any budget. A Montecito production -- so far there have been three in this vein: ''Road Trip,'' ''Eurotrip'' and ''Old School'' -- costs, on average, a fraction of what typical studio films do and (so far) earns a better rate of return. ''Road Trip'' cost about $17 million, Pollock told me, and ''Eurotrip'' and ''Old School'' each cost about $25 million. ''Eurotrip'' did about $18 million at the box office,'' he explained, ''so it lost a little money.'' But both ''Road Trip'' ($68 million) and ''Old School'' ($75 million) did well at the U.S. box office, especially with young men. ''Old School'' sold about six million DVDs, moreover, which translated into extraordinary additional profits. ''This is a long, fancy way of saying that when you make these kinds of comedies, on your losers you'll lose $3 million or $4 million,'' Pollock said. ''But on 'Old School,' DreamWorks, our partner, made over $100 million. Cash.''
 Sequels have a different calculus. When Montecito made ''Old School,'' for instance, Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell together were paid about $2 million. For ''Old School 2,'' a film Pollock would like to make even though it doesn't fit his frugal approach, Vaughn and Ferrell together could cost as much as $30 million or $40 million -- and that doesn't include the original's third star, Luke Wilson. This isn't a problem only Pollock faces; it's an industry-wide quandary. As one agent told me, unless such stars adopt a sliding scale, the economics of combining two or three of them in a single film no longer make sense. To many people I spoke with -- agents, producers and executives alike -- the top talent has been so successful that they now risk pricing themselves out of the very markets they've created.
 A few months before I visited Los Angeles, this was the situation when Rothman and Gianopulos at 20th Century Fox pulled the plug (at least for now) on ''Used Guys,'' a science-fiction comedy starring Ben Stiller and Jim Carrey, partly because its projected costs reached $112 million. In Hollywood, those close to the matter were still discussing its implications. At the very least, the blowup appeared to be a warning that the studios were getting serious -- I often heard the word ''rational'' -- about minimizing risk and boosting profits. But whether it meant that comedy stars would no longer fetch enormous upfront payments -- that seems doubtful. As financially attractive as the penny-stock model for comedies may be, movies with huge stars will not suddenly disappear. ''Those guys who are getting $20 million,'' Rothman says, ''if they're in a very funny film, they're likely, on a purely economic basis, to be worth it.'' What seems probable is that stars who have been getting large, additional ''back end'' percentages of a film's gross will find those deals a thing of the past. And it almost certainly means that the studios' interest in some blue-chip comedians is on the wane. Jim Carrey, for instance, has had a dismal year -- not only did he change agents, but two film projects he was involved in, in addition to ''Used Guys,'' collapsed. Carrey's films have taken in billions around the world; in purely financial terms, his value to the studios has been far more than $20 million a picture. Yet the difficult question now is whether, after a string of failures, employing him at a high salary plus a back-end percentage diminishes the profit potential for the studios. Put simply, Carrey may be too big a risk these days.
 Newly expensive stars like Vaughn and Ferrell present a different kind of uncertainty: both stars' movies do well here but poorly abroad. Pollock says he believes that the domestic (and DVD) potential of ''Old School 2'' makes it worthwhile to spend the money on the stars anyway. He and Reitman may get the money without going through the studios: they recently struck a deal with Merrill Lynch to help finance a slate of 10 films, at an average cost of $25 million. Michael Blum, a managing director at Merrill whose team agreed to finance the deal, says that computer-driven analysis -- usually the stock in trade of any investment banker -- can't contribute as much to this deal as it might to non-Hollywood ventures. Investing in a couple of respected movie veterans, on the other hand, who have a prudent approach and enough access to the studios to influence a range of crucial factors (a movie's opening date, for instance), should have a positive effect on box-office results. You can't be blind to the subjective side of this business, Blum told me: ''We've got sophisticated computer models. We can slice and dice and look at slates of films in prior years in various different ways. We can put probability on certain genres, in certain seasons, with certain budgets, with certain directors, and spit out various probabilities of returns.'' But as Blum sees it, Reitman and Pollock simply know how to identify promising material and make good, profitable movies. ''Old School 2'' doesn't fit their typical criteria, but Blum says that it might make sense anyway. The costs will no doubt be higher, but Blum sees higher revenues too. And he may wager that that will translate into healthy profits.
 Over time, the studios may become more receptive to relying on probability models for their decisions; several economists who study the industry, most notably Anita Elberse at Harvard and Jehoshua Eliashberg at Wharton, told me they believe we're on the cusp of understanding how studios can make more efficient bets on films. One advance would use computer models to put a more accurate value on the contributions of stars (and thus adjust their salaries accordingly); another would evaluate the financial viability of scripts before approval (Eliashberg has spent the past few years creating a database and software program called the ''scriptanalyzer'' for just such a purpose). Elberse and Eliashberg have each discussed using such methods with at least one studio and various production companies.
 One plausible outcome is that sophisticated analysis would screen out more of the losers, resulting in a higher percentage of good -- or at least financially viable -- movies. But would we get as many great and risky films? And would we get better comedies? That seems unlikely. Computers and money managers aren't the best arbiters of funny. Obviously they lack the quirky appreciation that allows for ''There's Something About Mary,'' a movie (made, not incidentally, with then up-and-comers Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz) that arguably raised the bar for what's permissible in a mainstream comedy. It's doubtful, moreover, that such a risk-averse system could tolerate the old-fashioned Hollywood pitch. When Matt Tolmach and Doug Belgrad, both production presidents at Sony, agreed to make ''Talladega Nights,'' for instance, it was an act of faith. The pitch consisted of Tolmach, Will Ferrell, the director Adam McKay, the producer Judd Apatow and Ferrell's manager, Jimmy Miller, all together in an office saying, ''Will and Nascar.'' ''That was it,'' Tolmach told me when I met with him and Belgrad in their offices at Sony. ''There was no script. And we agreed to make the movie.''
 I asked them if they could imagine backing out of the deal if the script, when it came in, wasn't funny.
 ''We didn't,'' Tolmach replied. ''And we honestly didn't think about it a lot. I mean, it wasn't literally 'Nascar!' and then they left the room. They had a character. They really knew who Ricky Bobby was.''
 Belgrad added: ''And there was a basic shape to it. It was kind of a sports movie.''
 ''There was a rise and fall and rise,'' Tolmach said. ''There was hubris and all that stuff.''
 ''But yeah, it was a big bet,'' Belgrad said.
 ''And we're doing the same thing with their next one,'' Tolmach said. ''And honestly, I feel better about that than about some scripts I have on some movies that we're making. I like those too. But these guys know what they do, and they know what is funny, and they know how to make their stuff funny. And they're commercial.''

HEADLINE: The Other Winners and Losers Nov. 5-11

 BODY:

ON WALL STREET

The News -- Investment bankers and the professionals who service hedge funds can expect year-end bonuses to rise as much as 25 percent this year over last year, according to a forecast by Alan Johnson Associates, a compensation consultant. 


Behind the News -- With profits soaring on Wall Street, this is the fourth year in a row in which bonuses are likely to be highly lucrative. The bonuses make up the bulk of a Wall Street professional's pay and can vary widely, from a million or two for a managing director to as much as $25 million for leading bankers who advise corporations and $50 million for top traders who make investment bets for their firms. A Lamborghini Murcielago, anyone?

IN THE MARATHON

The News -- Kurt Fearnley, a 25-year-old from Australia, set a record in the New York Marathon in the men's wheelchair division, finishing in 1 hour 29 minutes and 22 seconds, nearly two minutes ahead of the record set last year.

Behind the News -- Even his bicyclist escorts had trouble keeping up. Traveling at roughly 17 miles per hour, Mr. Fearnley set the record despite crashing into a pothole. It was his second marathon in a week, having finished second in Oita, Japan, on Oct. 28. Mr. Fearnley, who was born with lumbar sacral agenesis and is missing part of his spine, told The Australian that he was hurting until he turned into Central Park, where the crowd cheered him on.

IN THE WORLD

The News -- For the sixth year in a row, Norway was ranked first on the United Nations' human development index as the country providing its citizens with the best chance of living a long and prosperous life.

Behind the News -- The index weighs factors like life expectancy (79.6 years in Norway), education, unemployment and income. The United States ranked eighth, behind Iceland, Australia, Ireland, Sweden, Canada and Japan. Not that Norway's 4.6 million citizens don't complain -- about the high taxes that sustain the welfare state, for instance. ''There are unsolved problems in Norway,'' one official conceded, but he urged citizens to ''battle this culture of whining, and look at the future with optimism.''

ON BROADWAY

The News -- ''The Times They Are A-Changin,''' the Broadway musical conceived, directed and choreographed by Twyla Tharp based on the songs of Bob Dylan, is to close on Nov. 19 after 63 performances.

Behind the News -- If something's not right it's wrong. In a previous musical, set to the songs of Billy Joel, Ms. Tharp ''found unexpected depths in Mr. Joel's music'' by using the bodies of her dancers to tell the story of an American working-class generation, Ben Brantley wrote in The Times. But Ms. Tharp ''single-handedly drags Mr. Dylan into the shallows,'' Mr. Brantley said, by ''using a whole lot more scenery, props and special effects to create a circus-themed allegory of fathers and sons.''

IN POP LIFE

The News -- Citing irreconcilable differences, the pop star Britney Spears filed for divorce from Kevin Federline, a onetime backup dancer, after two years of marriage and two children.

Behind the News -- The last few weeks have not been kind to Mr. Federline. His debut rap album sank, and he had trouble attracting audiences to his shows. Still, he told reporters last Monday, his wife was pulling for him: ''She's probably my No. 1 fan, you know what I'm saying?'' But the next morning, Ms. Spears filed for divorce. Her fortune is said to be protected by a prenuptial agreement. As for Mr. Federline, a k a K-Fed, fans of Ms. Spears are calling him Fed-Ex.

HEADLINE: The Corporate End Run

 BODY:
Corporate profits are at record levels. The Dow, too, has climbed past its high-water mark from the dot-com era. Executives reap bigger and bigger paydays, even as wages have stagnated. Meanwhile, the widening investigation into stock-option backdating reminds us that the corporate malfeasance era was much more than just a couple of bad apples like Enron and WorldCom. 
 It seems almost unbelievable, then, that corporate America would pick this moment to beg for relaxed regulation and enforcement, as well as more protection from investors' lawsuits. But as Stephen Labaton reported recently in The Times, industry groups are seeking broad new protections for corporations and accounting firms, not through legislation but from the Bush administration through agency rule changes.
The rationale is that the high cost of complying with the corporate governance law, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, along with runaway lawsuits have scared foreign companies away from American stock exchanges. The timing is particularly odd given that the compliance costs associated with the much-reviled Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley -- which requires audits of companies' internal financial controls -- fell last year, as did the number of investor lawsuits, for the second year in a row. 
 What has actually happened is that opponents of regulation believe that the coast is clear. The law's namesakes, Paul Sarbanes and Michael Oxley, are retiring. Kenneth Lay of Enron is dead. The time appears ripe for rollbacks. 
 Advocates of big business like to point to a sharp decline in the United States' share of global initial stock offerings between 2000 and 2005, hoping that everyone will infer that the cause was the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002. In fact, that share had been declining since 1996, even before the Asian financial crisis. It hit bottom in 2001 and has risen since.
 United States markets lost their dominance of initial stock offerings for numerous reasons that had little to do with regulation. Some of last year's biggest deals were Chinese and French privatizations. Markets elsewhere are bigger and more liquid than they once were. There are also intangibles, such as America's recent unpopularity, increased barriers for visa seekers and extraordinary budget and trade deficits, which might make an issuer think twice about a dollar-denominated stock.
 The London Stock Exchange, one of the leading beneficiaries of the American decline, commissioned a study showing that underwriting fees in London are just 3 percent to 4 percent of a transaction, compared with an average of 6.5 percent to 7 percent in the United States.
 When workers confront globalization, they are told to adapt, take their pink slips and go to night school. It is the harsh downside of an integrated world economy that has on balance significantly enriched the country. When financiers feel the pinch from competition in Hong Kong and London, they run to the Bush administration for rule changes.
 America's investor protections and corporate regulations have made it a nation of share owners, with almost 57 million American households owning stocks either directly or through mutual funds. The Securities and Exchange Commission has already signaled that it will smooth the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley, especially for smaller companies. And abuses of the private litigation system like pay-to-play should be stopped. There is room for reform. But over all, the system is working. It may need tweaks, but it does not need a revamping.

HEADLINE: New Condos Inspired By Africa

BYLINE: By DAVID SCHARFENBERG

 BODY:
TUCKED between a rickety African market and a gleaming new luxury apartment building, the construction site on West 116th Street that will eventually be the Kalahari condominium complex is a kind of symbol for the social and economic forces shaping Harlem. 
 The building, set to open in December 2007, signals encroaching gentrification: bamboo flooring, glass-enclosed showers and an on-site gym will separate the building from the Martin Luther King Jr. Towers, a public housing project across the street.
But for all its bourgeois touches, the Kalahari also makes serious gestures toward an older Harlem. 
 Nearly half of the 249 condos planned for the $119 million building have been set aside for moderate-income buyers. A family of four with a household income of $63,800 to $131,165 would qualify for one of the subsidized units. StreetSquash, a nonprofit organization that provides Harlem children with academic tutoring and squash instruction, is to spend $9 million on a community center in the rear of the building. And an independent film center at the site, to be called My Image, will focus on Latino and African diaspora movies.
 The developers -- Full Spectrum of NY in Harlem, and L & M Equity Participants in Larchmont, N.Y. -- have emphasized African-themed design for the structure, named after the desert in southern Africa.
 The facade will be covered in decorations inspired by South African Ndebele tribal designs. Adinkra symbols, West African icons representing concepts like wisdom, unity and perseverance, will adorn the columns. And a sculpture by El Anatsui, a Ghanaian artist, is to hang in the lobby.
 Carlton Brown, chief operating officer for Full Spectrum, said culturally appropriate design is important in a place like Harlem, which he calls the ''intellectual center'' of black America. ''A lot of what has been built in what is sometimes called the Second Harlem Renaissance has not addressed the cultural elements,'' he said.
 Jack Travis, a cultural design consultant who worked with Fred Schwartz, the lead architect, on the African decorative flourishes, sees them as part of a search for an ''Afrocentric'' design.
 ''It is an environment,'' he said. ''It is a small urban plan. And it is in a black community, which begs, desperately, for a cultural identity of buildings and spaces that reflect the notions and intentions of the people in the community.''
 But for all his enthusiasm, Mr. Travis acknowledges a certain irony in the appearance of Afrocentric design on a luxury condominium that represents, at least in part, a neighborhood's gravitation beyond the means of blue-collar African-Americans.
 The irony is not lost on the locals, either. John Nelson, 54, an unemployed construction worker walking past the building recently, said he had little use for the Kalahari and its African stylings. ''They going to do that for what?'' he asked. ''To get black people to come in the apartments?''
 ''People in our category,'' he said, ''we can't afford that.''

HEADLINE: Is This Rent Legal?

 BODY:

Q. I live in a rent-stabilized apartment in Manhattan, and I have begun to suspect that the rent I was charged when I moved in two years ago had been raised beyond what the law allows. How do I research this matter?

A. Robert Sokolski, a Manhattan lawyer who represents tenants, said landlords are required to register the legal regulated rents of rent-stabilized apartments with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal every year.
 ''To ascertain whether the rent you are paying constitutes an overcharge, you must first review the rental history for your apartment,'' Mr. Sokolski said. He said a tenant can obtain a printout of an apartment's rental history from the appropriate borough office of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal. 
 The office for Manhattan apartments on the north side of 110th Street and above is at 163 West 125th Street; the telephone number is (212) 961-8930. 
 The office for apartments south of that is at 25 Beaver Street; the telephone number is (212) 480-6238.
 ''If you go in person,'' he wrote in an e-mail message, ''be sure to bring proof of identity and proof of occupancy, like a copy of your lease or a rent or utility bill.''
 It is also possible to obtain the rental history under the Freedom of Information Law. The housing division has its own request form, which you can get from its Web site at dhcr.state.ny.us/index.htm (then search for FOIL-1). Or call the Rent InfoLine at (718) 739-6400.
 Another piece of information the tenant will need is a list of annual increases allowed by the city's Rent Guidelines Board. He said, ''You can get them on the board's Web site at www.housingnyc.com/ or by calling (212) 385-2934.''
 Finally, Mr. Sokolski said, tenants should keep in mind that there is a four-year statute of limitations for an overcharge claim. This means that in most cases, tenants can get refunds for overcharges for only the preceding four years.

When a Manager Breaks Into a Co-op

Q. My co-op did not get my approval or inform me ahead of time before breaking into my apartment. They broke my expensive security lock and changed it to a different lock.
 Is it an emergency if they thought one or two loose tiles in my bathroom wall were allowing water to leak into the apartment below? They didn't even give me 24 hours to respond.

A. ''The precise rights of a cooperative to enter a shareholder's apartment are governed by the proprietary lease,'' said Aaron Shmulewitz, a Manhattan co-op lawyer. Typically, he said, a proprietary lease provides that a co-op's management personnel may enter at any time, including when a shareholder is not present, to make necessary repairs.
 ''If it's an emergency situation, the cooperative can enter by force by removing the locks, or even by breaking down the door if necessary,'' he said, noting that what constitutes an emergency depends on the particular facts. ''Active water leaks are often deemed an emergency, depending on the extent of the water flow.''
 Mr. Shmulewitz noted that it would have been unnecessary for the co-op to break into the apartment if the shareholder had left a set of keys with the building's superintendent, as required by the standard proprietary lease and state law.

HEADLINE: The $38,500 Closet

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
TO live in New York City is to covet thy neighbor's closet. Especially if it's a walk-in.
 Since apartment living is by its very nature space-limited, storage or the lack thereof can mean the difference between strolling out the front door in a well-pressed suit and shuffling out while trying to straighten a hopelessly rumpled collar. But the lowly closet is not just a place for shoe boxes and sweaters anymore. It has become a hot commodity -- a player in the New York real estate market.
Developers of new buildings tout basement storage units as an amenity almost on a par with a gym or a doorman. Wire-mesh storage cages now routinely sell for $30,000 to $40,000, and enclosed storage rooms can sell for twice as much.
 Not to be outdone, co-op and condo boards in older buildings are finding ways to retrofit extra storage space, even if that means evicting the superintendent's mops and dustpans from a utility closet so that it can be rented out. Many of these spaces have waiting lists that run for years, and they become available only when someone moves out or dies. 
 The advantages are clear. Residents get private storage without having to trek to a faraway warehouse. Unused areas of the buildings are transformed into clean, practical and profitable spaces. And building sponsors or boards get a new source of income without raising fees or imposing assessments. 
 ''Closet space is so precious in Manhattan,'' said Monica Klingenberg, an executive vice president of Marketing Directors Inc., an agency that markets and sells luxury co-ops and condos. ''We're all trying to eke every square inch out of our living space, so the ability to have additional storage space is just a gold mine.''
 That's exactly what Peggy and Jose Alonso thought when they learned last year that their co-op on East 90th Street, which is made up of three prewar walk-up buildings, was offering a 10-by-10-foot basement storage room for sale.
 Eight people bid on the space, which had a dirt floor and no door and shares a wall with a boiler room. The Alonsos won with a bid of $38,500. 
 They spent about $5,000 more to finish the space and put in shelves. ''I wish we could have found another one like this,'' Mr. Alonso said. ''When you pay $500 a month to rent a storage room somewhere else and you own nothing, you can begin to compare and you see $38,500 is reasonable.'' At $500 a month, a $38,500 storage space would be paid for in about six and a half years.
 The Alonsos are collectors, and virtually every item in their one-bedroom apartment could be featured on ''Antiques Roadshow,'' from an original Felix the Cat metal toy to their antique sleigh bed. They are still in the process of moving from a four-bedroom house in Woodside, Queens, and have filled their storage room floor-to-ceiling with vintage clothing, antiques that don't fit upstairs and seasonal items like Christmas wrapping paper.
 ''We collect everything, so we really needed this extra storage,'' Mrs. Alonso said. ''But once it's full, that's it. Whatever doesn't fit, gets donated.''
 The price trajectory of the Alonsos' storage room perfectly illustrates the growing demand and consequent price inflation for storage space in city apartment buildings.
 David Mosier, the president of the Alonsos' co-op, said the board first decided to sell basement space in 2000, after being warned that the building would lose its insurance unless the flood-prone basement was improved. 
 Still, the idea of selling the space to offset the cost of the repairs was initially met with skepticism. ''The alternative would have been to fix it and keep it as common space,'' Mr. Mosier said. ''But nobody wanted to do that because they didn't want to spend the money.''
 The co-op board installed new basement drains to solve the flooding problem and put in new walls, but made no other improvements. It initially charged just $20 per square foot for the unfinished space, and most of it sold within the next year or so. But the unit that the Alonsos eventually bought lingered. ''Nobody wanted it,'' Mr. Mosier said.
 By 2005, he said, ''prices went crazy, and apartments that were only $200,000 a few years earlier were selling for $800,000.'' So when the board offered that last remaining storage space for sale again, the auction led to the $38,500 closet, which works out to $385 a square foot. 
 In the end, Mr. Mosier said, selling the basement space ''made a lot of people happy since the basement has been improved and everyone's co-op shares are now more valuable.''
 Shaun Osher, the chief executive of Core Group Marketing, said that while developers rarely included storage space in their buildings 10 or 15 years ago, ''now it's expected, and as long as there's an opportunity to put it in, they're doing it.'' 
 But, he added, ''not all storage space is created equal.'' 
 He said he had seen storage prices ranging from $700 to $2,000 per square foot, with basic wire cages at the low end, and at the high end, sealed and climate-controlled rooms suitable for storing wine or fine art, some selling for as much as $80,000. 
 ''The storage space generally reflects what's happening upstairs,'' he said. ''And it doesn't matter if you have a small or big apartment, space is at such a premium in the city, everyone finds this additional space valuable.''
 Michael Chapman, an executive vice president of Stribling, said storage was often one of the first things that prospective buyers asked about when shopping for an apartment. ''Closet space within units is becoming more and more minimal,'' he said, ''so extra storage is becoming so important to people. If you asked New Yorkers what they would rather have, parking or storage, I think most would say storage.''
 Kenneth Horn, the president of Alchemy Properties, said that this reality led his company to incorporate storage into all of its latest projects. Three buildings under construction will offer storage cages for sale, with prices ranging from $28,000 to $36,000 in Brooklyn, and slightly more in Manhattan.
 But in three other projects that Alchemy completed in the last two years, storage units have been provided with every apartment at no extra charge. Like other developers, Mr. Horn said, Alchemy sells storage units only when there are not enough units to assign one to each apartment, and so they must be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis. 
 At the Lion's Head Condominium on West 19th Street, which is nearing full occupancy, Mr. Horn said, he and his partners decided to put in a storage cage for each of the 67 apartments after realizing that constructing a ramp for a basement garage would be prohibitively expensive. ''We had the space, so we wanted to make them an amenity as best as we could,'' he said.
 But he said that planning 67 storage cages, with larger ones for the larger apartments, was more complicated than it might seem. An architect was brought in to map out the basement, making allowances for mechanical equipment and rooms set aside for the maintenance staff. 
 The resulting space is well lighted, ventilated and equipped with sprinklers and security cameras.
 Stephen Alton, an architect who recently moved into the building, said the 6-by-8 storage cage that came with his 1,150-square-foot loft had helped to persuade him to buy at Lion's Head. ''In my opinion, storage space is probably No. 1 in the hierarchy of amenities,'' he said. 
 Mr. Alton said that he stored his luggage, winter clothing, wine glasses and large platters in his cage and that he had come to see the space as an extension of his apartment. ''When you consider that it's a place for things that would normally take up space upstairs, which you're paying $1,100 per square foot for, it's an incredible value,'' he said.
 At least one of his neighbors took that one step further. Mr. Horn said that she had no use for her storage cage, so she rents it to another resident for $175 a month.
 In new construction, when storage is provided with an apartment, the square footage is generally tacked onto an apartment's square footage, which means that it will figure into maintenance costs and property taxes.
 When storage is sold separately, however, many condo boards choose to sell licensing agreements instead of selling the storage units outright. Licensing agreements are usually transferable and entitle the owners to exclusive use of the storage space in perpetuity, but since there is no actual property transfer, buyers do not have to pay transfer taxes, closing costs or property taxes. Depending on how the agreement is written, residents can either sell the storage units with their apartment as a package, or they may have to sell them back to the board or to another resident. 
 In older buildings that are adding storage space, many co-op and condo boards choose to avoid a major capital investment in cleaning up the potential closet space, either by farming out the job to a company that will then manage and rent out the units, or by directly renting out space to residents. 
 At 56 Jane Street, a 30-unit co-op in the West Village, the board turned to a storage company that agreed to come in, clean up an unused basement area and install and manage eight metal storage lockers in the room. The company charges $65 a month for each 4-by-8-foot locker and returns a quarter of that amount to the board.
 Philip Gillich, the vice president of the co-op's board, said that before the space was finished, he was worried that none of the residents would be interested. ''If you had looked at the raw space, you would not want to put any of your stuff down here,'' he said, because the room was dark, dank and dusty. 
 But once it was finished and the bright blue lockers had been installed, they were all rented within days, and there is now a waiting list. 
 Having a storage unit in an off-site warehouse might cost less than renting or buying one in an apartment building. Prices at Manhattan Mini Storage, for example, range from $39 a month for a 4-by-4-by-5-foot cube to about $300 a month for a 7-by-12-foot room. 
 But New Yorkers are accustomed to paying more for service and convenience, said Carolyn Levitan, a vice president of Bellmarc, who pays $225 a month to rent a former utility closet just down the hall from her condo on East 72nd Street. The closet is about 3 feet deep and 8 feet wide. 
 ''My closet is a luxury I'm happy to pay for because it means I don't have to get into a cab to go to a storage space somewhere else,'' she said.
 Her 44-story condo tower was built in 1990 without any private storage, and the condo board only recently decided to rectify that. But finding space after the fact was not easy, and the building was able to install only about 20 storage cages and lockers, tucked away in basement corners and next to mechanical equipment. They rent for about $150 a month.
 Last year, the building decided to clean out utility closets on residential floors -- they had been used to store paint cans and extra carpeting for the hallways -- and the closets rented quickly. 
 Ms. Levitan uses hers to store skis, an inflatable guest bed and her off-season clothes, which she keeps on a rack that she rolls into her apartment with each change of season. ''The city is all about scaling down,'' she said, ''and I work very hard at not being a pack rat. But if I didn't have my closet for overflow, all my things would get ruined. They'd all be wrinkled.''
 In some ways, the new emphasis on in-house storage space harks back to the days before 1929 when many of the grand buildings along Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue were built.
 Edward Lee Cave, who owns a real estate agency that specializes in such buildings, said they typically provided three types of storage. Each apartment would get a wine cellar that could hold 500 bottles, a basement laundry room with deep porcelain sinks where the maids would do the washing, and a good-sized storage cage.
 ''These things would vary in size depending on the building,'' Mr. Cave said. ''But in the great, great, great prewar buildings, storage was an inalienable right.'' 
 Developers of those buildings lavished space on storage because they were trying to coax wealthy people out of town houses and into their new apartment buildings, he said.
 ''So buildings are going back to that focus on luxury, and they're allocating the space for storage again,'' he said. ''But now they're charging for it.''

HEADLINE: Celebrating Mass Without the Masses

BYLINE: By TINA SHAH

 BODY:
It was 12:20 p.m. on a recent Monday, and the Rev. Norberto Cordovez, the assistant pastor at the Chapel of San Lorenzo Ruiz, was preparing to celebrate Mass. Wearing an emerald stole atop his white robe, he peered out at the 36 empty wooden pews. Then, almost as if he were speaking to himself, he began reading from the Bible. 
 Ten minutes later, a lone elderly woman walked in and took a seat. This time, at least, Father Cordovez would not have to finish Mass by himself.
''It's good if two come,'' he said after the service. ''And we are lucky if five come.''
 This is not how the Rev. Erno Diaz, the pastor, envisioned the attendance level when the chapel opened last year. But the chapel has been a victim of the fact that almost no Filipinos live in its neighborhood.
 Housed in a brown brick building on Broome Street near Mulberry Street, part of an expanding Chinatown, the chapel was intended as a gathering place for the city's growing Filipino population. According to the 2000 Census, New York is home to 50,000 Filipinos, most of them Roman Catholic. 
 If local Filipinos crave garlicky chicken adobo, they can stroll down Roosevelt Avenue near 69th Street in Woodside, Queens. If they want news from home, they can pick up a copy of The Filipino Reporter. But to worship in a setting where specific traditions of their culture are observed, like singing hymns in vernacular and attending 5 a.m. Masses for nine days before Christmas, Filipinos' option for years was a bare-bones room in a Midtown office building that the New York Archdiocese had made available.
 After a decade of lobbying, Father Diaz persuaded the archdiocese to establish a chapel to serve this population. Named after the first Filipino saint, the chapel opened in September 2005, and while all worshipers are welcome, its services are designated especially for Filipinos. 
 To become a full-fledged church, a chapel must show that it is economically stable and has a regular congregation. San Lorenzo Ruiz is nowhere near meeting those criteria. That is because although Filipino communities can be found in Midtown, Woodside and especially Elmhurst, Queens, very few Filipinos live in Chinatown.
 Father Diaz is struggling to pay the bills. And paradoxically, not only are worshipers sparse on weekdays -- on Sundays, Filipino families and organizations sponsor Masses and invite friends and relatives -- they are not even necessarily Filipino. 
 One regular at daily Mass is Gilda Cianci, 91. Every afternoon for the past 72 years, she has descended three flights of stairs from her apartment, and, now with the help of a cane, walked across the street to the chapel.
 Ms. Cianci, who on this Monday afternoon was wearing a Blessed Mary pin on the collar of her navy coat, was a regular at the Catholic church that occupied the site on Broome Street, Most Holy Crucifix, which for decades served the neighborhood's Italian-Americans. But she is not dismayed by the fact that the chapel is for the Filipino community. ''I come to church to praise God,'' she said. TINA SHAH

HEADLINE: Where the Haircut Is Only the Beginning

BYLINE: By TYLER GRAY. 
Tyler Gray is a senior editor at Radar Magazine and Radaronline.com.

 BODY:
BEHIND a plate-glass window on West 10th Street, where the phrase ''For Men for Women'' was emblazoned in gold leaf 35 years ago, Shaun Cottle snipped away at the shock-blond locks of his client, Genesis P-Orridge. 
 Without a word from Ms. P-Orridge, Mr. Cottle, the 34-year-old stylist and co-owner of Seagull Haircutters, knew exactly how she wanted to look -- identical to Lady Jaye, her partner and collaborator in the industrial band Psychic TV. Just moments ago, Mr. Cottle had finished Lady Jaye's hair.
Ms. P-Orridge, who was born in Manchester, England, as Neil Andrew Megson, a boy, is a robust, tattooed 56-year-old with a complete set of solid gold teeth. Lady Jaye, 37, who was born in Bushwick, Brooklyn, as a woman, is a slimmer but similarly punky version of her other half. 
 ''It's an excellent canvas for me,'' said Mr. Cottle, dressed this day in his usual black pencil jeans, a ''Daddy's Boy'' tattoo on his arm. When he finished, Ms. P-Orridge and Lady Jaye were perfect doppelgangers, at least from the back. 
 Breyer P-Orridge, as the two are collectively known, are striving to transform themselves into a single persona by means of cheek implants, permanent eyeliner, lip injections, oral surgery, breast augmentation (which they had together on Valentine's Day last year) and, of course, identical hairstyles. In the couple's life-art, Genesis explained, their bodies are their raw materials. 
 ''I feel the same way about hair,'' Mr. Cottle interjected. 
 Neither Mr. Cottle nor Johanna Fateman, the shop's 32-year-old co-owner and Mr. Cottle's longtime best friend, talks about hair the way other people do. 
 Ms. Fateman, a member of the feminist electronic punk band Le Tigre, is not herself a stylist. Mr. Cottle, however, who is called Shaun Sure Thing on the Web site Citysearch, considers himself not only a hairdresser but also a ''secondary caregiver'' with whom his clients can't help sharing intimate experiences. 
 The pair, who bought the shop in April, are the fourth owners of Seagull since the salon opened in 1971 at 240 West 10th Street. Their goal is to revive the old West Village barber shop as both a haircutting operation and a salon in the broadest sense of the word. 
 Seagull may be an ideal setting for that endeavor. The raw living-room-size space, furnished with vintage pieces and found knickknacks, each with a little story of discovery attached to it, seems to have enough in the way of character -- and characters -- to justify a rate of $90 for the latest bangs cut.
 When Seagull opened 35 years ago as a hub for gay men, lesbians and transgender people, being openly gay was far riskier than it is today, even in a neighborhood where leather shops and rough-trade joints outnumbered Tex-Mex bistros and gelato shops. At the now gay-friendly Sixth Precinct, which moved in 1970 from Charles Street to its current location across the street from the salon, officers used to round up cross-dressers. A 1969 raid at the Stonewall Inn, originally at 51 Christopher Street, just around the corner, sparked the first and most famous gay rights protest in the city's history.
 But if the salon's oral history is accurate, Seagull has always been more than an ordinary barbershop. It was the first unisex barbershop in the neighborhood, the city and maybe the country. Richard Stinson, the founder, took the shop's name from Richard Bach's novel ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull,'' about a bird who grew bored with foraging for food in the same patch and took flight to chase a different destiny.
 Austin Carbonella, the shop's second owner, felt a similar pull in 1993, when he offered to sell Seagull to one of his hairdressers, Liz Henao. Ms. Henao's husband, Hernando, refurbished the floors in purple and orange checkerboard but kept the original sign, which hangs outside the shop today. 
 THE '90s recession and the subsequent recovery sent a lot of small West Village shopkeepers packing, among them the Thai knickknack seller next door (his place is now a computer shop) and the Buddhist sculpture dealer next to him (now the hip boutique Castor & Pollux).
 Seagull kept on going. ''People would come by without appointments and just hang out on the couch,'' Ms. Henao said, ''because life in New York was getting stressful.'' AIDS, too, took its toll on her customers. 
 ''A lot of the guys were coming in to say goodbye,'' Ms. Henao recalled. Among them was a man with AIDS who had gone blind in his last months. When she finished giving him what he considered his final haircut, she said, ''he asked to hold the mirror so he could see the back.'' Ms. Henao obliged. ''Seagull has always been a place where people could be themselves,'' she said, ''even in that part of their lives.'' 
 Mr. Cottle went to work for Ms. Henao in 1997 but left the following year to move to Seattle. Then, earlier this year, he and Ms. Fateman learned that Ms. Henao wanted to sell the salon and leave the city. After a decade of performing with Le Tigre, Ms. Fateman had amassed a sum of money she described only as ''not enough to buy an apartment'' but enough to enable her and Mr. Cottle to buy the shop. 
 The pair covered the walls with a thick coat of pink paint that looks like frosting on a wedding cake. They filled back shelves with mementos, among them a porcelain lamb that Mr. Cottle says was a gift from his first gay male friend, and a tiny poodle figurine that Ms. Fateman recovered while cleaning out the house of a friend's mother, who had died. 
 There are still gaps in bookings, but Seagull's new clientele seems to be expanding beyond artists and creative types. Typical of some of the new customers is Rachel Bartov, a 23-year-old investment banker, who was getting color and a cut the other day and had heard about Seagull from a woman she described as ''a hipster friend in Brooklyn who was on the hunt for the perfect bangs cut.'' 
 Did Ms. Bartov know that Ms. Fateman of Le Tigre was an owner? ''Not until I got here,'' Ms. Bartov replied, ''but it's pretty awesome. I will probably relay that.'' 
 Late one evening (the shop is open Wednesdays through Sundays from 2 to 10 p.m.), a woman with jet-black hair grown out silver at the roots walked in asking for ''detergent-free shampoo'' that she used to buy from Ms. Henao.
 What did she think of the shop's latest incarnation? 
 ''In spirit, it's the same,'' the customer replied. Then she turned to Ms. Fateman. ''You took down the beaded curtains,'' she said. ''Actually, I'm relieved.'' 
 The customer, who declined to give her name, added: ''The Village mythologized in bohemian myth doesn't exist anymore. Stores of any creativity are losing ground to lifestyle branding. I don't know the new owners. But this is clearly not a corporate lifestyle place.''

HEADLINE: The Gay Label

BYLINE: By Sean Safford. 
Sean Safford is an assistant professor of organizations and strategy at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.

 BODY:
IN the second act of Oscar Wilde's ''Importance of Being Earnest,'' Gwendolen Fairfax, the urbane social climber, and Cecily Cardew, the apple-cheeked country ingenue, realize they are both engaged to men they believe to be named Ernest Worthing. 
 ''This is no time for wearing the shallow mask of manners,'' Cecily declares. ''When I see a spade I call it a spade.'' To which Gwendolen replies: ''I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade. It is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.'' 
The decision recently handed down by the New Jersey Supreme Court requires the New Jersey Legislature to decide whether ''gay marriage'' is a spade or a slightly different social implement; similar in most respects, but not exactly the same thing. 
 The court ruled that there can be no discernible difference between the rights and obligations associated with heterosexual and homosexual relationships. 
 The only question at hand is a semantic one: are the committed partnerships of gay men and lesbians properly labeled ''marriage'' or something else? 
 Whether or not we call committed relationships between same-sex partners ''marriage'' may seem beside the point. But labels do matter -- as extensive research on businesses and the economy confirms. 
 For example, Wall Street gets into trouble when the categories it uses to describe particular stocks don't reflect investor expectations. Similarly, Hollywood studios lose when the labels they put on movies don't jibe with the way movie-goers interpret the films. 
 But Gwendolen was right about one thing. Labels live in the social spheres of day-to-day interaction, not in dictionaries, laws or regulations. People will put up with some cognitive distance between their own system of categorization and the labels officially imposed on things. But when the labels people carry in their heads differ significantly from the categories written into the books, something has to give. 
 The fact is gay people have been hitching up for time immemorial. What has changed is that more and more of us are doing our hitching up openly and with the blessing of friends, families, co-workers and neighbors. It is inevitable that the labels we use to identify our relationships should evolve to reflect that.
 Much of American society is keeping pace. More than half of the Fortune 500 provides health care benefits to the partners of gay and lesbian workers on par with those of straight employees. In popular culture, themes and characters once segregated to appeal specifically to the gay and lesbian ''demographic'' are now more likely to be woven into a mainstream narrative just as they are in daily life, as evidenced by recent television programs like ''Project Runway,'' ''Sex in the City'' and ''Six Feet Under.'' 
 The wheels of government are inevitably slower. Still, throughout American history, the labels our government has used to categorize people have changed to reflect the shifting contours of society. Because just as there are costs associated with mislabeling things in the world of business, when the categories we inscribe into law are too narrow they have harmful political, social and economic consequences.
 The most disastrous example, which was written into the United States Constitution, was the legal definition of an African-American slave as three-fifths of a person. We are still living with the results of that error two centuries later. 
 Being placed in a separate category is insulting, demeaning and humiliating. But beyond those emotions there are significant social, economic and political costs to hardening social categories that are otherwise inherently fluid. 
 So while the love that dare not speak its name has been subjected to countless euphemisms over the years -- special friends, roommates, domestic partnerships, ''Boston marriages'' and most recently civil unions -- the best label is always the simplest. And that label, in this case, is plain old ''marriage.''

HEADLINE: Foreign Import Has Clawed Its Way Up

BYLINE: By JOE WOJTAS

DATELINE: Mystic, Conn. 

 BODY:
WHEN Asian shore crabs first began to appear along the coast of Long Island Sound in 1993, James Carlton, a Williams College professor, offered a hot fudge sundae to any of his undergraduate students at Mystic Seaport who could find one along the southeastern Connecticut coastline. 
 Ten years later, Mr. Carlton, director of the Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program, was offering sundaes to anyone who could find a crab other than the Asian shore variety. 
At the other end of the Sound, in Rye, N.Y., George Kramer, chairman of the environmental studies program at SUNY College at Purchase, said that if he went out now and collected 1,000 crabs at his study site at the Edith G. Read Wildlife Sanctuary, ''between 998 and 999'' would be Asian shore crabs. 
 Long Island Sound and the New Jersey shoreline have become the epicenter of an invasion that began 18 years ago when Asian shore crabs first arrived here from the Western Pacific, most likely, scientists have said, in the ballast of a cargo ship. Since that first sighting at Cape May, N.J., in 1988, this aggressive crab -- formally known as Hemigrapsus sanguineus -- has spread from Maine to North Carolina. Along many coastal areas, including the Connecticut, Long Island and New Jersey shores, it has virtually eliminated other species of crab.
 Scientists have not been able to determine whether the crabs, which eat just about anything, will cause any significant environmental or economic damage. But one thing is sure: They are here to stay.
 ''There's nothing you can do about them,'' Mr. Kraemer said. ''Just look at the sheer numbers. It would be impossible to get rid of them.''
 The crabs are found along the rocky shore on the north and south shores of Long Island, said Robert M. Cerrato, an associate professor in the Marine Sciences Research Center at Stony Brook University. At Crane Neck Point in Brookhaven, N.Y., there used to be a large population of blue mussels, Mr. Cerrato said, but suddenly last fall there were hardly any left.
 ''Whether it could happen naturally or the crabs got in there, I can't say for sure,'' he said. ''But these are the kinds of things that could potentially take place.''
 Asian shore crabs are just the latest of many nonnative invasive species to arrive in United States waters. The zebra mussel has caused widespread damage to power plants and pipelines in the Great Lakes, while researchers at the University of Connecticut are studying the effect of a fast-growing Japanese seaweed that was found in the Sound in 1994.
 Such invasions worry scientists like Mr. Carlton, who has been trying to persuade Congress to strengthen laws regarding the release of ballast water by cargo ships in coastal waters. 
 Mr. Carlton, who has studied exotic invasive species for 44 years, said he was worried that the next invader might cause devastating ecological and economic effects.
 ''For a lot of us, the most pressing issue is what will be next,'' he said. ''What if the next species has a big impact on the Long Island oyster industry, which is one of the biggest in the country? It's ecological roulette.''
 Larry Williams, a Milford shell fisherman and co-chairman of the Connecticut Seafood Council, said that while the Asian shore crabs would chip away at juvenile shellfish, there did not appear to be any visible impact so far on Connecticut's $17 million oyster and clam industry. 
 ''We're lucky it hasn't had a huge impact on the oyster industry,'' he said. ''But it's a lesson for all us. It's a harbinger of things to come.''

HEADLINE: From a Small Loan, a Jewelry Business Grows

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IT'S no small hop from Bangladesh to Jersey City, but a strategy pioneered in Bangladesh has nourished Audrey Hu's home-based jewelry business on the west bank of the Hudson.
 The strategy is microcredit, the granting of small loans to people, often very poor, who cannot get traditional bank financing to start or expand small businesses. Last month, a Bangladeshi economist, Muhammad Yunus, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for establishing microcredit on a widespread basis in his poverty-stricken South Asian country starting in the 1970s, and for inspiring its spread to other countries, including the United States.
In America, 350 to 400 organizations provide microloans these days, specialists on the subject say. They include the Women's Venture Fund, a Manhattan-based nonprofit group that aids low-income women who seek to open or expand small businesses in New York City and New Jersey. 
 Which brings us to Ms. Hu, who began making and selling jewelry in 2002, when she was struggling financially after being laid off from her job at a cosmetics company. 
 Two years after she started her business, a $7,000 loan from the Women's Venture Fund enabled her to improve the marketing of her necklaces and earrings, and she expects that this year revenue from the business, AHJewelry, will be twice the approximately $30,000 it was in 2003.
 Ms. Hu sells wholesale and retail. Before the loan, she said last week, she lacked the money to rent space at trade shows, where she has a better chance of making more and larger wholesale deals with stores than through the means she had largely been limited to before. ''I was cold-calling stores, beating the pavement, sending them catalogs,'' she said. 
 She used part of the borrowed money to participate in trade shows, obtaining orders often worth thousands of dollars, compared with hundreds in her earlier efforts.
 Equally important, she said, the loan enabled her to upgrade her only outlet for selling directly to customers, her Web site, ahjewelry.com. Originally, it was a limited site designed by a friend, with only a phone number and an e-mail address for placing orders. It also had inadequate space for showing her creations, a major drawback considering that she was promoting the unusual look of her pieces; many of them combine peacock, duck or other feathers with semiprecious stones. With the loan, she was able to pay a professional to make the site larger and permit online buying. 
 Before she learned about the Women's Venture Fund, Ms. Hu said, banks told her that her business income was too weak for her to qualify for a loan, or that she would have to provide collateral, which she lacked.
 Maria Otero, the fund's president, said her group had a broader definition of creditworthiness. In Ms. Hu's case, for example, ''we were impressed with her passion to make this happen,'' she said. 
 But Ms. Otero also suggested that it had helped that Ms. Hu had come in with more than a mere wish to have a business. ''We won't do it with just an idea,'' Ms. Otero said. ''They have to show that they can close a sale to someone beyond a family member and friends.'' 
 Ms. Otero said that she founded her group in 1994 to help make commercial credit more available to women, and that reports of Mr. Yunus's microloan approach indicated ''a good way to go.'' The fund has since made about 150 loans totaling $1.5 million, an average of $10,000 a loan. Its loan maximum is $15,000, she said, though it may soon be raised to $35,000. 
 The higher number is the limit generally accepted for a business loan to be considered a microloan in the United States these days, said Sara Ignas, a spokeswoman for the Association for Enterprise Opportunity, whose member groups include many of the country's microlenders. 
 Such figures contrast starkly with the typical microloan, ranging from $150 to $600, in most of the more than 100 countries in which microloans were made in 2005, according to another organization, the Microcredit Summit Campaign, based in Washington. 
 But given that most of last year's 113 million microloans worldwide were made in poor and developing countries, the contrast is hardly surprising.
 ''The cost of starting and running a business in the United States is very much more than in developing countries,'' Ms. Ignas said.

HEADLINE: For Conservatives, It's Back to Basics

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE morning after the Republican drubbing in the midterm elections, Ken Mehlman, chairman of the party, headed to the weekly coalition meeting where limited government conservatives, Christian traditionalists and gun-rights groups gathered to plot strategy. He brought a message they were only too eager to hear.
 The election, he told the crowd at the headquarters of Americans for Tax Reform, was not a repudiation of conservatism. It was a mandate to ''recommit ourselves to being reform conservatives,'' he said, telling them that the president would not flinch from arguing for ideas like privatizing Social Security.
Recalling a line Woody Allen used to break up with a girlfriend in the movie ''Annie Hall,'' Mr. Mehlman said, ''If a shark doesn't keep moving he dies.'' He added, ''I think the same is true of political parties.''
 Thirty years after the birth of the conservative movement, some stalwarts worry the shark may be heading into shallow waters. At the coalition meeting, one organizer after another complained that their Democratic opponents had staked out moderate to conservative stands on what had been the movement's most potent issues -- abortion, gun rights, religious expression, income taxes and the federal deficit. 
 Perhaps most of all, a movement once galvanized by a shared determination to end Soviet Communism now finds itself deeply divided over the Iraq war. 
 ''Our successes are killing us,'' said Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform who convenes the weekly meeting. He compared Tuesday's election to the story of the princess and the pea, with the pea being liberal governance. 
 ''Whenever we solve a problem -- like cutting taxes or destroying the Soviet Union -- we are in effect adding another mattress,'' he said. ''We have to go back to the voters and convince them, 'you still can't sleep because the goddamn pea is killing you.' ''
 Assessing the Republican losses, liberals quickly pronounced the end of the 30-year rise of the conservative movement. Conservatives prefer to talk of a temporary crisis. Since the election, a chorus from the right has been noisily distinguishing between conservative and Republican, blaming deviation from conservative principles for the election losses. From George Will to Rush Limbaugh, conservatives cut loose with criticisms of the Republicans for spending too much at home and getting bogged down in Iraq. 
 ''Apostasy,'' Mr. Will declared.
 But as conservatives vow to regroup and return, many acknowledged that the path ahead may be a tough slog. The combination of Democratic moderation and Republican governance has blunted many of the right's sharpest attacks on the left. And some conservatives acknowledged that distancing themselves from the unpopular policies of their Republican allies might not be easy.
 ''What is being rejected is not conservatism,'' said David A. Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union. ''It's something far different. The problem is we're identified with it. If the wagon goes off the cliff, you're likely to go with it.''
 Liberals are writing the movement's obituary. John Podesta, founder of the Center for American Progress and former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, called the midterms ''the end of the grand conservative experiment.'' 
 The pillars of the movement, Mr. Podesta said, had collapsed under the weight of conservative rule: ''stewardship of the Iraq war'' had undercut conservatives' credibility on national security; budget deficits and stagnant wages had discredited tax cuts; and Congressional scandals had given the lie to the movement's moral values. As a result, he said, the Reagan Democrats were returning. 
 Conservatives, though, say the midterm election was less about ideology than the result of the war in Iraq, which many now disavow as an un-conservative idea, wrongly associated with their movement by a faction of the right known as neoconservatives.
 The intellectual heirs to a group of Democrats whose opposition to Communism pulled them to the right during the cold war, the neoconservatives believe that the United States should be willing to apply military force to fight terrorism and to promote democracy abroad. American conservatives have traditionally favored the use of force only for self-defense, broadly interpreted to include containing Communism during the cold war.
 ''There were no conservative grass-roots group saying, 'Invade Iraq,' '' Mr. Norquist said. ''If Bush changed the policy, you'd have four neocons whine and the rest of the movement would be fine.''
 Neoconservatives, in response, say others on the right were happy to support the war when it helped rally voters in 2002 and 2004. Gary J. Schmitt, a neoconservative foreign policy adviser in the Reagan administration, said some were ''jumping ship when the going gets tough.'' 
 And if they back away from the rationale for the war, said William Kristol, editor of the neoconservative magazine Weekly Standard, conservatives may give up their status as the forceful party on national defense, jeopardizing their long-term prospects for a governing majority. ''As a political matter, conservatives should try to help Bush succeed because they are not going to get very far distancing themselves from him,'' Mr. Kristol said.
 Whatever their views on the war, though, conservatives agree on aspect of the midterms: Republicans may have lost, but their ideology did not. Among other things, they argue that the midterms turned both the Republican and Democratic caucuses further to the right. In the House, the Republicans who lost tended to be moderates from politically mixed districts, while the conservative caucus, the House Republican Study Committee, expects to have roughly the same number of members -- about 110, making committed conservatives an even larger majority within the party. And as House Republicans begin campaigning for party leadership posts, all the candidates are framing their arguments around returning the party to its conservative roots.
 Democrats, meanwhile, have arguably grown more conservative as well. After two decades of defeats, they have largely dropped their former calls for major defense spending cuts, talk of a Canadian-style national health insurance, or campaigns for gun control. They work hard to avoid getting tagged as tax raisers, and since 2004 they have tried to open their doors to opponents of abortion as well.
 To be sure, many Democrats campaigned this fall for increasing the minimum wage, preserving the estate tax or a prompt withdrawal from Iraq. But the party made many of its gains in both the House and the Senate by recruiting candidates with conservative views on abortion and gun rights, most notably Bob Casey Jr., the senator-elect in Pennsylvania, and Heath Shuler, representative-elect from North Carolina. 
 Even the massacre of a school full of Amish children did not move the Democrats to renew their calls for gun control -- a stark contrast to the party of 1990s. ''The Democrats didn't do anything,'' Mr. Norquist marveled.
 The election has expanded the ranks of the 47-member, centrist New Democrat Coalition by as much as a third, and the 37-member conservative Blue Dog Coalition says it expects nine new members. 
 If the Democrats have backed away on those fronts, what's left for the conservative movement? Aside from the neoconservatives, conservatives have focused on a single theme: the steep growth of federal spending under Republican rule.
 ''The greatest scandal in Washington, D.C., is runaway federal spending,'' Representative Mike Pence of Indiana declared in the opening statement of his campaign to become majority leader.
 Morton Blackwell, who was President Reagan's liaison to the conservative movement, said spending was in some ways the last frontier for conservative organizers. ''On guns, on life, on the right to work'' -- that is, gun ownership, abortion rights, and opposition to organized labor -- ''the strongest supporters of the conservative cause have been identified,'' he said. ''Those who will write checks on those issues have been identified, and the people who are concerned most on those issues are already part of organizations and donor lists run by very effective people.''
 But selling spending reductions may not be as easy as selling tax cuts, which first ignited the conservative grass roots. ''It is the problem of concentrated benefits and diffused costs,'' Mr. Blackwell said. ''For the people who want a spending program, it is the most important thing in their lives. They want and need that spending. They will work day and night to get that spending. But the cost is so diffuse it is hard to find people who have similar opposition to it.''
 ASSESSING the election, William F. Buckley Jr., who founded the National Review magazine and helped define the movement, said he was not optimistic about the immediate future. ''The conservative movement is in a sense inanimate, compared to 20 or 30 years ago,'' he said.
 As for the spending habits of the Republican Congress, ''there is a kind of ideological slovenliness which affects the morale,'' Mr. Buckley said. ''It is as if the American Civil Liberties Union were every couple of days to favor proscribing a particular book or a particular performance or something, causing people to look at the A.C.L.U. and wonder if it had a credible mission.''
 He was not sure what might revive the movement, especially since the current combination of low taxes, high government spending and moderate inflation tends to create a sense of economic prosperity -- at least in the short term. 
 ''It will perhaps take something like a depreciation of the dollar, something electric,'' he said. If countries ''stop subsidizing our debt it will be terrible shock to a lot of people, and then I think conservative reservoirs of thought would be consulted.''

HEADLINE: They Came in From the Cold War

 BODY:
In his memoir, ''Man Without a Face,'' Markus Wolf chronicled his 34 years directing the foreign intelligence service of East Germany's Ministry of State Security, or Stasi. His network of spies infiltrated NATO headquarters and the West German chancellery. 
 The intelligence world, East and West, was a realm of moral shadows. Its practices were often unethical, its methods dirty. Given this fact, it seems to me that the C.I.A. was at a peculiar disadvantage in having to take part in a sort of democratic pantomime to satisfy the requirements of the American Constitution, regardless of whether or not they were relevant to intelligence work. No secret service can ever be democratic nor, however much politicians may wish it, open to constant scrutiny and still perform its tasks properly. In the C.I.A., much of senior officers' time was taken up preparing documents and summaries of their work to present outside the agency, always with half an eye on the reaction of politicians and the press. 
The C.I.A.'s miscarried attempts to unseat Fidel Castro and its haphazard tactics in Central America had brought down its reputation among conservatives and liberals alike. Assessments made by our officers in the Washington and New York stations regarding American intelligence in the 1970s and 1980s showed it to be far less respected than in the 1950s and 1960s. This, as any management consultant could have said, had an effect on the morale of its officers. The organization came to be seen not only as secretive and underhanded -- quite normal judgments of a powerful intelligence service -- but seedy, a reputation no intelligence service can afford. Secret services are psychologically unstable places and their internal mind-set is quickly reflected in performance. Reports on the traitor Aldrich Ames revealed a high level of self-hatred within the C.I.A. Ames not only disliked his own agency, he despised it. 
 In fact, spotting C.I.A. operatives in Bonn was ridiculously easy. Quite unlike my own insistence on careful preparation and slow, almost imperceptible approaches to a potential recruit, they always set off on a frantic round of making contacts. Targets we had planted often complained of the agents' poor level of knowledge of the economic problems of the East, which made it hard to know what line to spin them because their basic information about the East was so sketchy. For a time in the late 1970s and 1980s the quality of the American agents was so poor and their work so haphazard that our masters began to ask fearfully whether Washington had stopped taking East Germany seriously.
 In his memoir, ''From the Shadows,'' Robert M. Gates details his career at the Central Intelligence Agency, and especially his relationship with William J. Casey, the controversial director of the agency during the Reagan administration.
 [G]etting the C.I.A. bureaucracy to do more on Soviet covert action and subversion was painfully hard and eventually took on a political edge. Only at the end of November 1981 were all C.I.A. stations finally tasked to submit a monthly report on Soviet covert action (''active measures'') in their respective countries as a way of permitting more aggressive counteroperations. And only after I became deputy director for intelligence in January 1982 did we at last establish on the analytical side an organization to study Soviet and other foreign covert actions and deception activities around the world. 
 To establish a data base of Soviet covert activities, I finally was able to persuade the deputy director for operations, John Stein, to allow a team of analysts to pore through the operational files on the U.S.S.R. A C.I.A. ability to monitor Soviet covert action in an organized and thorough manner was at last born -- 35 years into the cold war. It was this kind of slowness and conventional thinking that exasperated -- and more than occasionally infuriated -- Bill Casey.
 Casey complained bitterly and often graphically when the analysis he got seemed fuzzy minded, lacked concreteness, missed the point, or in his view was naive about the real world, when it lacked ''ground truth.'' 
 An analyst had to be tough and have the courage of his or her convictions to challenge Casey on something he cared about and knew about. He argued, he fought, he yelled, he grumped with the analysts in person and on paper.

HEADLINE: What Do We Want In a Spouse? 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Too Close for Comfort,'' by Stephanie Coontz (Op-Ed, Nov. 7):
 Today, we want from our spouses what we have always sought in marriage: companionship, economic support, children and respectability. But now we also want our partner to be our best friend, our trusted confidant and our passionate lover. 
 The problem is that we ask one person to give us what an entire village and extended family used to provide. No wonder our isolated domestic units crumble under the expectations. 
 Work may be one devouring source of this crisis, but so are the power of the romantic ideal that emphasizes togetherness above all else and the lack of social and institutional support in the United States, a country that loves to invest in marriage but fails to support parents.

Esther Perel
New York, Nov. 8, 2006

The writer is the author of a book about marriage.

To the Editor:
 Stephanie Coontz writes that ''we need to restructure both work and social life so we can reach out and build ties with others, including people who are single or divorced.'' That statement has never rung more true in my life than after my husband died a few years ago. 
 I found it extremely difficult to forge and maintain bonds with those I initially thought would become part of my support network, so entrenched were they with their own lives. Ironically, it is the friend with the most challenging and unconventional life who is the first to offer me assistance and to include my daughter and me in family events. 
 Regrettably, I am sure I was no different when I had a nuclear family life of my own. Painful lessons indeed.

J. Athanikar
Ann Arbor, Mich., Nov. 7, 2006

To the Editor:
 Not only does the expansion of the post-industrial economy drive us back to dependence on marriage, but it also strengthens several American cultural values, which add to marriages' demise. 
 We have an ingrained pride in our independence and our individuality, which acts to separate us from feeling responsible for a larger group or community. Americans constantly scream for their individual rights, when sometimes the rights of the group should prevail. 
 When coupled with our belief in healthy competition, we struggle with the problems of life in private, isolating ourselves from a group that should support us. We tend to turn to marriage for that needed support, which, as Ms. Coontz points out, strains the relationship.
 In other cultures, Asia in particular, the importance of belonging to a group supersedes the right of the individual, and a natural support system evolves. Perhaps with globalization we can learn to embrace other cultural values and improve our relationships.

HEADLINE: Facing Reality on Europe's Immigrants 

BYLINE: By DAVID C. UNGER

 BODY:
''Write an article!'' came the shout as I left a room full of German women preparing the food for their weekly breakfast discussion meeting in the Rollberg housing project in the Neukolln section of Berlin. 
 They were Germans now, but most had been born elsewhere, generally in Muslim countries. One wore a head scarf, the others did not. The youngest looked about 19. The oldest might have been a grandmother.
These women illustrated a reality finally accepted by some of Germany's most conservative politicians -- there is no reason someone cannot be German and Muslim at the same time. In America, that idea would be unremarkable. In Germany, with its tragic history of exclusive nationalism and race-based citizenship, it is an intellectual revolution. 
 The moving spirit behind these meetings was Ayten Kose, an infectiously enthusiastic woman of Turkish descent, who relished telling a visitor what it had taken to make this project a reality. 
 The weekly breakfasts were among the activities of an outreach program sponsored by the local government and the European Union. One goal is to help the project's residents connect with one another and with local public services. That, in turn, is meant to reduce the sense of isolation many immigrants feel from the larger society they live in and from its political institutions. 
 Through this program, residents had gotten help in ridding public rooms in the housing project of the intimidating young toughs who hung out there, discouraging women from leaving their apartments. That reclaimed space became home to the Friday breakfast gatherings, where the women compared notes on problems from domestic violence to developments in Afghanistan, Gaza and Iraq.
 It took a long time for Germany's leaders to wake up to the fact that millions of foreign-born or foreign-descended residents -- people who originally arrived as guest workers or asylum seekers, along with their German-born children and grandchildren -- intend to live their lives in Germany with no plans of returning to their ancestral homelands. 
 More than three million of these new Germans are Muslims -- nearly two million from Turkey, with most of the rest from Bosnia, Albania, the Arab world, Pakistan and Iran. 
 It is in Germany's interest to help these newcomers succeed and prosper, by helping them improve their German language skills, preparing them for better jobs and smoothing their path to German citizenship. That lessens the risk of their slipping into an underground world of isolation, joblessness and despair, where they might fall prey to terrorist recruiters.
 The new realism of its politicians is welcome, but Germany has a long way to go. Immigrants still face violent attacks from xenophobic neighbors and the discriminatory attitudes and practices of some local governments. Despite recent reforms, it remains too difficult for many long-time residents to become citizens.
 Yet, despite its shortcomings, Germany's new approach contrasts favorably with that of neighboring France -- the home of Western Europe's largest and perhaps least integrated Muslim population. 
 French policies have been confounded, paradoxically, by the country's militantly integrationist official ideology. The well-meaning insistence that all French citizens are simply French has led to decades of willfully ignoring the particular needs and diverse cultures of distinctive segments of the French population. 
 The poor and unemployed young men who burned cars in suburban neighborhoods last fall weren't protesting the noble French ideal ofegalite. They were protesting the daily humiliation of coping with police officers, politicians and employers who have no real idea of what their lives are like and no desire to find out. It is that kind of estrangement that German programs like the one in Neukolln are trying to avoid.

HEADLINE: Foreign Import Has Clawed Its Way Up

BYLINE: By JOE WOJTAS

DATELINE: Mystic, Conn. 

 BODY:
WHEN Asian shore crabs first began to appear along the coast of Long Island Sound in 1993, James Carlton, a Williams College professor, offered a hot fudge sundae to any of his undergraduate students at Mystic Seaport who could find one along the southeastern Connecticut coastline. 
 Ten years later, Mr. Carlton, director of the Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program, was offering sundaes to anyone who could find a crab other than the Asian shore variety. 
At the other end of the Sound, in Rye, N.Y., George Kramer, chairman of the environmental studies program at SUNY College at Purchase, said that if he went out now and collected 1,000 crabs at his study site at the Edith G. Read Wildlife Sanctuary, ''between 998 and 999'' would be Asian shore crabs. 
 Long Island Sound and the New Jersey shoreline have become the epicenter of an invasion that began 18 years ago when Asian shore crabs first arrived here from the Western Pacific, most likely, scientists have said, in the ballast of a cargo ship. Since that first sighting at Cape May, N.J., in 1988, this aggressive crab -- formally known as Hemigrapsus sanguineus -- has spread from Maine to North Carolina. Along many coastal areas, including the Connecticut, Long Island and New Jersey shores, it has virtually eliminated other species of crab.
 Scientists have not been able to determine whether the crabs, which eat just about anything, will cause any significant environmental or economic damage. But one thing is sure: They are here to stay.
 ''There's nothing you can do about them,'' Mr. Kraemer said. ''Just look at the sheer numbers. It would be impossible to get rid of them.''
 The crabs are found along the rocky shore on the north and south shores of Long Island, said Robert M. Cerrato, an associate professor in the Marine Sciences Research Center at Stony Brook University. At Crane Neck Point in Brookhaven, N.Y., there used to be a large population of blue mussels, Mr. Cerrato said, but suddenly last fall there were hardly any left.
 ''Whether it could happen naturally or the crabs got in there, I can't say for sure,'' he said. ''But these are the kinds of things that could potentially take place.''
 Asian shore crabs are just the latest of many nonnative invasive species to arrive in United States waters. The zebra mussel has caused widespread damage to power plants and pipelines in the Great Lakes, while researchers at the University of Connecticut are studying the effect of a fast-growing Japanese seaweed that was found in the Sound in 1994.
 Such invasions worry scientists like Mr. Carlton, who has been trying to persuade Congress to strengthen laws regarding the release of ballast water by cargo ships in coastal waters. 
 Mr. Carlton, who has studied exotic invasive species for 44 years, said he was worried that the next invader might cause devastating ecological and economic effects.
 ''For a lot of us, the most pressing issue is what will be next,'' he said. ''What if the next species has a big impact on the Long Island oyster industry, which is one of the biggest in the country? It's ecological roulette.''
 Larry Williams, a Milford shell fisherman and co-chairman of the Connecticut Seafood Council, said that while the Asian shore crabs would chip away at juvenile shellfish, there did not appear to be any visible impact so far on Connecticut's $17 million oyster and clam industry. 
 ''We're lucky it hasn't had a huge impact on the oyster industry,'' he said. ''But it's a lesson for all us. It's a harbinger of things to come.''

HEADLINE: Weighing the Benefits Of Wind Power

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Your article about wind power, ''Is the Answer Blowing in the Wind?'' (Nov. 5), gave an excellent overview of current efforts to tap into this clean, abundant and domestic energy source. 
 While wind output is inherently variable, it can be successfully integrated into our electric grid. Contrary to findings in the ABS Energy Research report you cited, a U.K. Energy Research Center report and a paper from United States utility associations find that challenges posed by wind as an intermittent power source are manageable with proper planning and operating procedures.
 A recent study commissioned by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority found that here in New York we could integrate 3,300 megawatts (or 10 percent) of wind power into our grid without any significant reliability problem.
 Wind power alone will not solve our energy problems. But together with other renewable energy technologies, aggressive energy efficiency efforts, and cleaning up our antiquated power plants, wind presents a viable answer.

Gordian Raacke

The writer is executive director of Renewable Energy Long Island.

To the Editor:
 Although wind power may be economic in some locations, articles nearly always give the capacity of the installation (under ideal conditions), not the fraction of the time that the units are actually useful. 
 Even the statistics on wind speed give the wrong impression. ''Average'' winds are not the criteria for operation. 
 The percent of the time that the winds are greater than about 14 to 16 miles per hour is the key. For example, equal wind times at 10 and 20 m.p.h. average 15 m.p.h., but generation would only be possible half the time, when the speed is over 14 m.p.h. 
 An economic issue, also rarely mentioned, is that because winds are not always blowing, duplicate generation capacity must be built, and paid for, to assure electrical system reliability.
 World societies should, must, deal with carbon dioxide and atmospheric pollution issues, but in order to assess the alternatives, the true economic costs must be completely understood.

Robert W. Kupp

The writer is a retired nuclear engineer.

To the Editor:
 ''Is the Answer Blowing in the Wind?'' highlights the constant tension between energy cost and environmental consequences. As an energy attorney having represented power generators fueled by everything from wind to water, I can tell you that there is a direct relationship between cost of energy and environmental harm -- the lower the cost, the greater the harm. 
 Hydrocarbon fuels, the least expensive, have the broadest and greatest harm on the environment. While wind is readily available, it costs more to turn into energy, but its environmental costs have lesser and more limited adverse impact. 
 In addition, each fuel source not only has a direct cost, but also an indirect cost: while wind may be ''free,'' what is the cost (read: environmental harm) of fuels and raw materials used in manufacturing the turbines used to make wind power available? How much copper goes into a wind turbine generator? What fuel was used to make it? 
 As the verbal tussle between Donald Trump and Richard Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, demonstrates, to a great extent environmental pollution is in the eye of the beholder and how it affects his or her pocketbook.

For example, equal wind times at 10 and 20 m.p.h. average 15 m.p.h., but generation would only be possible half the time, when the speed is over 14 m.p.h. 
 An economic issue, also rarely mentioned, is that because winds are not always blowing, duplicate generation capacity must be built, and paid for, to assure electrical system reliability.
 World societies should, must, deal with carbon dioxide and atmospheric pollution issues, but in order to assess the alternatives, the true economic costs must be completely understood.

To the Editor:
 ''Is the Answer Blowing in the Wind?'' highlights the constant tension between energy cost and environmental consequences. As an energy attorney having represented power generators fueled by everything from wind to water, I can tell you that there is a direct relationship between cost of energy and environmental harm -- the lower the cost, the greater the harm. 
 Hydrocarbon fuels, the least expensive, have the broadest and greatest harm on the environment. While wind is readily available, it costs more to turn into energy, but its environmental costs have lesser and more limited adverse impact. 
 In addition, each fuel source not only has a direct cost, but also an indirect cost: while wind may be ''free,'' what is the cost (read: environmental harm) of fuels and raw materials used in manufacturing the turbines used to make wind power available? How much copper goes into a wind turbine generator? What fuel was used to make it? 
 As the verbal tussle between Donald Trump and Richard Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, demonstrates, to a great extent environmental pollution is in the eye of the beholder and how it affects his or her pocketbook.

To the Editor:
 In 1975 we spent our vacation time researching wind energy experiments at NASA's Plum Brook Station and on Long Island. The results of our investigation were published in technical magazines like Power Engineering, Design Engineering and Machine Design. 
 Your article stressed the many technological improvements made in the past 30 years. However, it did not include the most important and timely information: Wind energy is available to Long Island residents through Long Island Power Authority affiliation with upstate New York wind farms at an additional cost of 2 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
 This is a small price to pay in our fight against global warming and our dependence on foreign oil.

HEADLINE: Foreign Import Has Clawed Its Way Up

BYLINE: By JOE WOJTAS

DATELINE: Mystic, Conn. 

 BODY:
WHEN Asian shore crabs first began to appear along the coast of Long Island Sound in 1993, James Carlton, a Williams College professor, offered a hot fudge sundae to any of his undergraduate students at Mystic Seaport who could find one along the southeastern Connecticut coastline. 
 Ten years later, Mr. Carlton, director of the Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program, was offering sundaes to anyone who could find a crab other than the Asian shore variety. 
At the other end of the Sound, in Rye, N.Y., George Kramer, chairman of the environmental studies program at SUNY College at Purchase, said that if he went out now and collected 1,000 crabs at his study site at the Edith G. Read Wildlife Sanctuary, ''between 998 and 999'' would be Asian shore crabs. 
 Long Island Sound and the New Jersey shoreline have become the epicenter of an invasion that began 18 years ago when Asian shore crabs first arrived here from the Western Pacific, most likely, scientists have said, in the ballast of a cargo ship. Since that first sighting at Cape May, N.J., in 1988, this aggressive crab -- formally known as Hemigrapsus sanguineus -- has spread from Maine to North Carolina. Along many coastal areas, including the Connecticut, Long Island and New Jersey shores, it has virtually eliminated other species of crab.
 Scientists have not been able to determine whether the crabs, which eat just about anything, will cause any significant environmental or economic damage. But one thing is sure: They are here to stay.
 ''There's nothing you can do about them,'' Mr. Kraemer said. ''Just look at the sheer numbers. It would be impossible to get rid of them.''
 The crabs are found along the rocky shore on the north and south shores of Long Island, said Robert M. Cerrato, an associate professor in the Marine Sciences Research Center at Stony Brook University. At Crane Neck Point in Brookhaven, N.Y., there used to be a large population of blue mussels, Mr. Cerrato said, but suddenly last fall there were hardly any left.
 ''Whether it could happen naturally or the crabs got in there, I can't say for sure,'' he said. ''But these are the kinds of things that could potentially take place.''
 Asian shore crabs are just the latest of many nonnative invasive species to arrive in United States waters. The zebra mussel has caused widespread damage to power plants and pipelines in the Great Lakes, while researchers at the University of Connecticut are studying the effect of a fast-growing Japanese seaweed that was found in the Sound in 1994.
 Such invasions worry scientists like Mr. Carlton, who has been trying to persuade Congress to strengthen laws regarding the release of ballast water by cargo ships in coastal waters. 
 Mr. Carlton, who has studied exotic invasive species for 44 years, said he was worried that the next invader might cause devastating ecological and economic effects.
 ''For a lot of us, the most pressing issue is what will be next,'' he said. ''What if the next species has a big impact on the Long Island oyster industry, which is one of the biggest in the country? It's ecological roulette.''
 Larry Williams, a Milford shell fisherman and co-chairman of the Connecticut Seafood Council, said that while the Asian shore crabs would chip away at juvenile shellfish, there did not appear to be any visible impact so far on Connecticut's $17 million oyster and clam industry. 
 ''We're lucky it hasn't had a huge impact on the oyster industry,'' he said. ''But it's a lesson for all us. It's a harbinger of things to come.''

HEADLINE: Body Found in Duffel Bag Is Identified as That of Brooklyn Man

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ and KATE HAMMER

 BODY:
A body found stuffed inside a black duffel bag on Thursday evening in Brooklyn was identified by the police yesterday as that of a young man whose relatives said was easygoing and someone who never strayed into trouble. 
 The body of the man, Roberto Sesenton, 23, was found shortly before 7:30 p.m. between two parked vehicles on Shore Parkway between Bay 17th Street and 18th Avenue in Bath Beach. His body was intact inside the duffel bag, which rested half on the curb and half on the street.
Mr. Sesenton was beaten, stabbed and strangled, said a spokeswoman for Charles S. Hirsch, the city's chief medical examiner.
 Mr. Sesenton, who was unemployed, lived with his sister and his nephew at an apartment in Bay Ridge, about three miles from where the bag was discovered. 
 His sister, Tiffany Sesenton, 24, said she had no idea why someone would harm her brother, who often helped look after her 3-year-old son, Tim.
 ''Whoever did this to him didn't know him,'' she said. ''He was a funny guy.''
 Mr. Sesenton was the father of a 2-year-old daughter, Destiny, and relatives thought of him as a big kid all grown-up, spending his time helping out around the apartment, playing video games and visiting his mother and grandfather.
 ''That's all he'd do was just help around,'' said Ms. Sesenton, a sales manager at a hotel. ''He never got in trouble.''
 She added that she was told of his death by the authorities on Friday and did not know his whereabouts before he was killed. 
 The spokeswoman for the medical examiner, Ellen S. Borakove, said Mr. Sesenton suffered strangulation and brain injuries from blows to the head and stab wounds to the neck. 
 Residents say the neighborhood near the Shore Parkway had been used over the years as a dumping ground for the Mafia. But a police spokesman said there was no indication that the killing was mob-related.
 No arrests had been made as of yesterday afternoon, the police said.

HEADLINE: Perspectives on the Atlantic Yards Development Through the Prism of Race

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
It was the first of three public hearings on the $4.2 billion Atlantic Yards development, and Umar Jordan, a 51-year-old resident of Bushwick, Brooklyn, strode to the front of the auditorium and offered a vigorous defense of the proposal. ''I'm here to speak for the underprivileged, the people that don't get the opportunity to work, the brothers that just came over out of prison,'' he said.
 Those who opposed the plan, he said, were not true Brooklynites. Their concerns about traffic and noise were trivial. And stopping the project would force ''young black men'' into a life of crime. ''I suggest you go back up to Pleasantville,'' he concluded.
It was not the first time race has bubbled up to the roiling, overheated surface of the Atlantic Yards debate, where charges of dishonesty and bad faith fly with abandon. Indeed, take any major debate about urban development in Brooklyn in recent years, and sooner or later, the issue of race has moved front and center -- usually linked to the question of who wins and who loses. 
 Some of the racial rhetoric in this fight has inverted the classic development squabble in which affluent, usually white New Yorkers tolerate ambitious development, while working-class people, often minorities in struggling neighborhoods, fear they will not enjoy its fruits. 
 Like Mr. Jordan, many of the most fervent supporters of Atlantic Yards present the project as a beacon of hope for black residents living near the proposed 8.7-million-square-foot project. 
 Critics of the project -- black and white -- see merely the same old development debate, punctuated by what they describe as a cynical race ploy. They say the project's developer, Forest City Ratner, has deliberately stirred up an imagined racial divide over the project, enlisting its black allies to falsely cast affluent white residents as the chief source of opposition and as insensitive to the needs of black Brooklynites. 
 ''I think race was used from Day 1 to window-dress the project,'' said the Rev. Clinton Miller, pastor of Brown Memorial Baptist Church in Fort Greene. 
 Bruce C. Ratner, Forest City's chief executive, is white, as are most of his executives. Several local community organizations with black leaders receive funds from the developer as part of a ''community benefits agreement'' they negotiated last year.
 But a closer look at the coalitions lined up for and against the project, and the arguments they have mustered, suggests that Atlantic Yards has drawn no true color line in Brooklyn, but only a blur of intersecting agendas, opinions and constituencies, both black and white.
 The project, designed by Frank Gehry, would radically alter the neighborhoods near Downtown Brooklyn where it would be built, with residential and office towers and a basketball arena for the Nets. Proponents say the project would provide more jobs and low-cost housing where they are urgently needed. 
 When pressed, however, nearly all of those involved in the debate played down the suggestion that opinion on Atlantic Yards cleaves to any purely racial contour. 
 They point out that the project's leading political booster, Borough President Marty Markowitz, is white, and its leading opponent, Councilwoman Letitia James, is black. 
 In neighborhoods around the project site, they say, the pressures of class and gentrification have been as potent as race -- though both sides say they believe those pressures favor their view of the project. 
 ''Some of my friends are in the opposition, and they're blacker than I am,'' said the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, a supporter and well-known Brooklyn pastor. ''It ain't a straight race question.''
 Joe DePlasco, a spokesman for the developer, denied in a statement that Forest City had tried to use race to build public support for the project, or to isolate opponents. 
 ''People say a lot of things, but at the end of the day you can only do what you think is right,'' he said in a statement. 
 ''From the start,'' the statement continued, ''we have reached out to diverse groups from all over Brooklyn -- from Crown Heights to Marine Park from Sunset Park to Park Slope -- to ensure that this project reflects the realities of life in this borough and addresses the unprecedented need for affordable housing, local jobs, small business development, health care, educational and training programs.''
 He added, ''Atlantic Yards is, among other things, all about inclusion, and we have worked hard to make it that way.'' 
 Forest City, which is also the development partner in building a new Midtown headquarters for The New York Times, would not comment directly on past statements by its supporters. 
 In recent conversations, however, many of those involved in the Atlantic Yards debate spoke at length about the role that race has played -- and not played -- in shaping opinion on the project. 
 Though Brooklyn as a whole has been losing white residents for decades, the number living near the project site -- in neighborhoods like Fort Greene, Boerum Hill and Prospect Heights -- has grown steadily in recent years, according to census data. 
 Those new arrivals are more likely to be affluent and highly educated, especially compared with residents of the nearby public housing projects, where most residents are black and many are unemployed. 
 As white transplants have boosted the area's median incomes, they have also forced up housing prices. In Fort Greene, for example, which borders the project site to the north, average apartment prices rose faster from 2004 to 2005 than in any other Brooklyn neighborhood.
 ''If you live nearby, you have a nice home and you have a job, you're probably not that excited by the benefits, and you're swamped by the drawbacks,'' said Brad Lander, director of the Pratt Center for Community Development, citing the project's potential to worsen traffic and overshadow the brownstone communities nearby.
 ''If you live a little farther away, and you don't have a job and a nice house, then you probably get a lot more of the benefits,'' Mr. Lander added. ''None of that is about race per se. But when you layer on that the people who live nearby are more likely to be whiter and wealthier, and the people who live farther out are more likely to be people of color without good jobs or housing, the race elements have become stronger.''
 That is one reason, say opponents and supporters alike, for the high-level interest in the project among the area's black working-class and poor residents. Thousands of people, most of them black, packed a July information session about the project's subsidized housing. 
 ''The devil could bring in a project and say it's jobs and affordable housing, and some of us will go for it, because we're on a survival level,'' said City Councilman Charles Barron. 
 But Mr. Barron also calls the project ''instant gentrification,'' a view shared by many opponents.
 Atlantic Yards would include a substantial portion of subsidized housing for families at different income levels; but only about one-seventh of the project's roughly 6,500 housing units would be classified as affordable for tenants making less than half of the median income for the New York City area.
 Mr. Barron and other critics say a different project could provide as much or more moderately priced housing, with less negative impact on the area. 
 Most recent public polls about the project show supporters outnumbering opponents. But those polls have generally been too small to reliably measure sentiment among specific ethnicor racial groups in Brooklyn or the city as a whole. 
 In interviews, activists on both sides said they believed support and opposition cut across racial and class lines. 
 But some in the debate previously expressed less benign views. 
 Last year, James E. Caldwell, the president of Brooklyn United for Innovative Local Development, a job-training group known as Build, said it would be a ''conspiracy against blacks'' if Forest City did not win its bid for rights to build over the railyards on the site. Bertha Lewis, the New York executive director of Acorn, a national advocacy group for low-income people, attributed concern over the project to ''white liberals.'' 
 Interviewed recently, both Mr. Caldwell and Ms. Lewis backed away from those remarks. ''Everybody said crazy things on both sides,'' Ms. Lewis said. ''I've apologized to folks, and folks have apologized to me.'' 
 Both Build and Acorn -- as well as a group Mr. Daughtry heads -- receive funds from Forest City under the community benefits agreement. And both have been instrumental in turning out black participants who boost the project at community meetings, rallies and hearings. That, opponents say, has helped fuel perceptions that black support for the project is high.
 In May, in an e-mail message to a Daily News reporter, the spokesman for Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, Daniel Goldstein, wrote of ties between those groups and what he termed their ''wealthy white masters,'' referring to Forest City. The reporter later wrote about the message, which sparked an outcry from the project's black supporters.
 Mr. Goldstein apologized for what he termed ''unfortunate remarks.'' But he and some black allies say his underlying criticism of Forest City and its supporters was legitimate. 
 ''Interestingly enough, the African-American leaders who have supported us, or who we have worked with, every single one I spoke to said, 'Sorry about what happened, you didn't really say anything wrong, but you weren't the person to say it,' '' Mr. Goldstein said.
 Opponents of the project say they had to fight against a perception that black Brooklynites tend to favor the project. Ms. James said that because black opponents of the project were likely to be less well-off, ''they just don't have the luxury of going to these meetings and reading 2,000-page documents.'' 
 Others, however, suggest that the main anti-Yards organizations -- their manpower, energy and funds provided largely by white members -- have not reached out effectively to the older, more established network of black community activists.
 ''The problem that whites who are organizing are having, groups like Develop Don't Destroy, is that they really are a one-issue organization,'' said Bob Law, a radio program host and business owner who is a member of Develop Don't Destroy's advisory board.
 Mr. Law does not spare Forest City. He said that the developer tried to ''inject race'' into the debate, urging its surrogates to cast whites as solely concerned with traffic and building height, and blacks as interested in basketball, housing and jobs. 
 But the leading opponents of the project, Mr. Law said, ''are only concerned with the project, so they play into Ratner's hands.''

HEADLINE: Shouldering Responsibility and Facing a Sea of Troubles

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
Jobe Davis begins a chronology of his rocky recent history with his decision eight years ago to have his widowed mother, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, come to live with him, his wife and their daughter.
 Mr. Davis, 65, says he does not regret the decision; he speaks of his determination ''not to put her in an institution.'' But he traces the events that have loomed so large in his life during the last three and a half years to that decision: the loss of his job, the end of his marriage and the near loss of his apartment, where his daughter, Claudjo, now 15 and in high school, and his mother, Marjorie, 85, continue to live with him.
When Mr. Davis moved his mother from South Carolina to his three-bedroom apartment in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, he arranged for a Medicaid-paid home health aide to care for her while he and his wife were at work. Mr. Davis was a maintenance employee with the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation, repairing electrical equipment and doing renovation at betting parlors.
 ''I would have to wait for the aide to come before I could leave for work, and most of the time it wasn't a problem,'' he said recently. 
 But too often it was a problem: When the aide was late, Mr. Davis was late, and, he said, after a while his supervisors began disciplinary action for what they regarded as excessive lateness. In June 2003, he was fired.
 He was 62 and, having been fired for what his employer considered to be misconduct, he could not find another steady job. The misconduct designation also made him ineligible for unemployment benefits. The loss of more than $400 a week in take-home pay left the family scrambling on his wife's income as a cook, his mother's Social Security benefits, and family savings that quickly drained away, he said.
 After several months, the family qualified for public assistance, he said, and the city's welfare program granted the Davises $156 a month in cash benefits and paid the landlord $400 a month to cover half the rent for the rent-stabilized apartment. The family also received $276 a month in food stamps. 
 Mr. Davis said, however, that because he had mistakenly thought the welfare program was paying the entire rent, they fell into arrears, which he discovered when they received an eviction notice three months after the welfare payments began. 
 The case was resolved in early 2004 and the eviction proceeding was dropped, he said. 
 That year, Mr. Davis and his wife separated after more than 15 years of marriage; his wife moved out. He said that she had opposed having his mother live with them, and that the strains had intensified because of a ''combination of the bills, me not working and the thought of losing this place.'' He considers it unlikely that they will reconcile.
 With his wife's income gone, things grew even tighter, Mr. Davis said, and back rent mushroomed into the thousands of dollars. After a new landlord moved to evict the family late last year, Mr. Davis sought help from charitable groups. Several responded to help spare the family the turmoil and trauma of an eviction.
 Among them was the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In April, the federation contributed $1,000 from the fund, the final amount needed to pay off the back rent, which by then totaled nearly $12,600, the federation said.
 ''I admired him for sticking around and raising his child on his own and taking care of his mother,'' said Laura DeMaio, Mr. Davis's caseworker at the federation. ''I work on cases where people are abandoned, and here's an older man taking primary responsibility for his child and his 85-year-old mother.'' 
 Mr. Davis said the $1,000 from the Neediest Cases Fund helped make ''the difference between staying in my apartment or being in the street.'' Besides the charities' aid, which totaled $5,000, Mr. Davis contributed nearly $3,000; that included rent money he had set aside when the landlord refused to accept it while the eviction was pending, Ms. DeMaio said. The city's Human Resources Administration, which runs the welfare program, provided about $4,000, she said. 
 Mr. Davis, who turned 65 last December, now receives Social Security benefits of $900 a month for himself and $400 for his daughter, while his mother's benefit is $700. The family also gets more than $200 a month in food stamps. Given his mother's further decline, Medicaid pays for a home health aide for 12 hours a day. 
 ''It's not comfortable; it's doable,'' Mr. Davis said of his family's financial situation.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Davis's landlord has submitted a plan for converting the building into a condominium. The document lists a discounted price of more than $700,000, should Mr. Davis wish to buy his apartment. 
 Mr. Davis said that the amount was from a planet other than his own, and he expressed concern about his future in the building, even though the plan gives residents unable or unwilling to buy their apartments the right to remain as renters.
 With his mother sitting at his side in their living room, Mr. Davis looked ahead to a year from now. By then, he said, he hopes to be earning some money from a steady job, and to be living in circumstances in which ''we have a more stable understanding of what our life will be like.''

OSSIAS, CHARLES MATTHEW

 BODY:
 OSSIAS--Charles Matthew, known to his friends as Matthew, was born on November 25, 1916 and lived a wonderful life in New York City, including childhood on Mosholu Pkwy in the Bronx and for over 50 years in Kew Gardens, Queens. Matthew was a graduate of Townsend Harris High School and held a Master's Degree in Education and Science from City College. He was a man of ethics and intellectual curiosity who spoke several languages including English, French, Spanish, Italian, Yiddish and Hebrew and had a lifetime love of history, Judaism, economics and religion. 
Matthew Ossias was reform Jew who was strongly committed to the ideals of Judaism as well as a pacifist and vocal advocate of non violence. For over 60 years, Matthew was committed to the philosophy and economic principles of Henry George, the 19th century reformer who, in his landmark book ''Progress and Poverty,'' decried the disparity between rich and poor and proposed the highly regarded theory of a single tax on land value to cure this and other social ills. Matthew served on the Board of Directors of the Henry George School of Social Science where for several years he headed the international correspondence division and taught the principles of ''Progress and Poverty.'' Among his achievements, Matthew brought the Georgist philosophy to people all over the world through the distance - learning program and by translation of the Progress and Poverty course into French, Spanish, Italian and, with the assistance of his wife Fryda L. Ossias, Haitian Creole. Matthew and Fryda were married at the New York Society of Ethical Culture on June 21, 1951 and were happily married for 55 years. Charles Matthew Ossias will be sorely missed and remembered by many friends and family, including his brother Abner, sons Robert & Stanley, daughtersin-law Madeline & Mable, grandchildren Emily, Harrison & Julian and his wife of 55 years, Fryda L. Ossias.

HEADLINE: Keeping Your Enemies Close

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: ALPHARETTA, Ga. 

 BODY:
IF you found yourself running a company suddenly branded one of the most reviled in the country -- if, for example, you noticed that visitors to Consumerist.com, a heavily visited consumer Web site, voted yours as the second ''worst company in America'' and you had just been awarded the 2005 ''Lifetime Menace Award'' by the human rights group Privacy International -- you might feel obliged to take extraordinary steps. You might even want to reach out to your most vocal critics and ask them, ''What are we doing wrong?'' 
 So it was in early 2005 that Douglas C. Curling, the president of ChoicePoint, a giant data broker that maintains digital dossiers on nearly every adult in the United States, courted two critics whom he had accused just months earlier of starting ''yet another inaccurate, misdirected and misleading attack'' on his company.
Mr. Curling also contacted others who had spent years calling for laws requiring better safeguarding of personal information that ChoicePoint and other data brokers assemble -- records such as Social Security numbers, birth dates, driver's license numbers, license plate numbers, spouse names, maiden names, addresses, criminal records, civil judgments and the purchase price of every parcel of property a person has ever owned. 
 ''It was sort of like when I talk with my wife when she's not happy with me,'' Mr. Curling said of his dealings with some of ChoicePoint's harshest critics. ''It's not exactly a dialogue I look forward to, but I can't deny it's important.'' He also could not deny his motivations for engaging in these conversations: in the public's mind, ChoicePoint had come to symbolize the cavalier manner in which corporations handled confidential data about consumers.
 In January, the Federal Trade Commission hit ChoicePoint with a $10 million fine, the largest civil penalty in the agency's history, for security and record-handling procedures that violated the rights of consumers. Under the settlement, it also required ChoicePoint to set aside an additional $5 million to help those suffering financial harm because of its failure to provide adequate safeguards against data breaches. 
 But the financial penalties were nothing compared to the rehabilitation project confronting this hitherto invisible player in the global marketplace. 
 For years, ChoicePoint's top management had assured the world that it carefully protected its databases from intruders: Our systems are bulletproof. Intruder-proof. Believe us.
 But then, in February 2005, the company had to acknowledge that it had focused so intently on preventing hackers from gaining access to its computers through digital back doors that it had simply overlooked real-world con artists strolling unnoticed through the front door. 
 Ultimately, ChoicePoint found that in 2005 alone, more than 40 phony businesses -- thieves masquerading as bill collectors, private investigators, insurance agents and the like -- had opened accounts that gave them unfettered, round-the-clock access to the vital data ChoicePoint maintains. And, suddenly, the same privacy advocates that ChoicePoint had generally cast as shrill and ill-informed -- a group that those inside the F.T.C. sometimes refer to as the ''privacy posse'' -- proved crucial to its plans to both shore up its security and tend to its tattered image. 
 ''I have to give them a lot of credit,'' said Daniel J. Solove, a posse member in good standing who had long been counted as one of ChoicePoint's most persistent critics. Mr. Solove, an associate professor at the George Washington University Law School, is among those whom ChoicePoint contacted shortly after its public relations debacle crested. ''ChoicePoint had the attitude: 'We want to make our privacy practices exemplary,' '' Mr. Solove said. ''They wanted to find out what kinds of things they could do better and get feedback about some of the ideas they were thinking about.''
 For ChoicePoint, said James Lee, the company's chief marketing officer, the entire episode has proved an important learning experience. ''The reality is, we were never as evil as people thought we were,'' Mr. Lee said, ''but we were never as good as we thought we were.'' 
 Inside ChoicePoint, situated in a leafy office park in this suburb north of Atlanta, employees whistle with wonder over the talents of the various con artists -- or ''fraudsters,'' as company executives tend to call them -- who finessed their way into their systems. According to the company, the fraudsters were wise enough to secure business licenses, thereby lending them a patina of legitimacy. They knew precisely what to write on their applications to convince ChoicePoint that their credentials made them fit for access to its databases.
 ''These guys were more sophisticated than anyone thought,'' Mr. Lee said, echoing the sentiment of many inside the company.
 But the F.T.C. seemed to reach the opposite conclusion in a 33-page report it released earlier this year, after it completed an investigation of ChoicePoint. The commission found that ChoicePoint ignored ''obvious red flags'' because the company ''did not have reasonable procedures to screen prospective subscribers.'' The report cast ChoicePoint's criminal interlopers as sloppy and amateurish -- but ultimately successful because their prey, a major company in the business of handling sensitive information, was alarmingly lax in its protection of its data repositories.
 Signs that it was amateur hour inside ChoicePoint abounded, according to the F.T.C. report. The fraudsters faxed applications to ChoicePoint from a neighborhood Kinko's, listed post office boxes as primary business addresses and offered cellphone numbers as sole telephone contacts -- which no one at ChoicePoint ever bothered to call anyway to establish the numbers' legitimacy. In at least one case, an approved applicant failed even to provide a last name, the F.T.C. found. 
 As ChoicePoint executives say, the fraudsters sometimes took the trouble to register their businesses with the state -- but those documents should have set off alarms rather than justify the granting of an account.
 The F.T.C. found that ChoicePoint accepted articles of incorporation that had been suspended or had expired, and ''tax registration materials that showed that the business' registration was canceled.'' Then there were the contradictory addresses in the submitted documents -- discrepancies that ChoicePoint employees accepted ''without conducting further inquiry to resolve the contradiction,'' according to the commission's report.
 ''It was a well-known fact back then that ChoicePoint would do business pretty much with anyone who came along,'' said Robert Douglas, an information security consultant and editor of PrivacyToday who has done consulting work for ChoicePoint for several years. ''They were making all the right noises about security but there wasn't any follow-through to back up their words.'' 
 Inside ChoicePoint, they like to say that the company is in the business of helping customers make informed decisions about whom they can trust. Insurance companies and banks use its databases to help them decide who is a good credit risk and who is not. ChoicePoint sells its services to employers screening new hires, to landlords running background checks on new tenants, and to the 7,000 law-enforcement agencies and governments worldwide that the company counts as clients. Other customers include bill collectors, private investigators and media outlets, including The New York Times. 
 Yet a company with the snappy motto -- ''smarter decisions, safer world'' -- failed to use its resources to assess and then protect itself from some of its own customers. In some cases, the F.T.C. found, individuals were granted accounts ''notwithstanding the fact that ChoicePoint's own internal reports on the applicant linked him or her to possible fraud.'' The company continued to furnish consumer reports to customers, the commission said, ''even after receiving subpoenas from law enforcement authorities between 2001 and 2005 alerting it to fraudulent accounts.''
 Finally, in September 2004, ChoicePoint began to recognize that it had a major problem on its hands, when an employee in the company's new-accounts office realized that someone in the Los Angeles area, a Nigerian, was trying to set up multiple accounts, each time in the name of a different business. The employee recognized the Nigerian's voice and alerted the company's security department, which in turn notified the local police. Although weeks would pass before senior executives learned of the troubling transactions with the Nigerian, the unfolding scam -- and others like it -- opened the eyes of outsiders to dangerous security lapses inside the company.
 ''I can assure you that now we learn immediately about this kind of problem,'' said ChoicePoint's chief executive, Derick V. Smith. 
 CHOICEPOINT was created in 1997 when Equifax, one of the big three credit reporting agencies -- the others are TransUnion and Experian -- spun off one of its divisions. Back then, the unit that would become ChoicePoint was involved in the labor-intensive and barely profitable business of maintaining claims histories on behalf of insurance companies. It also administered physicals, drug tests and the like for clients. Mr. Smith and Mr. Curling, who together ran what was then called the Insurance Services Group, foresaw a promising market in peddling data about individuals to a wider group of customers, and they convinced higher-ups that their unit should venture off on its own. 
 Since then, ChoicePoint has acquired more than 70 smaller companies and bought whatever databases it could get its hands on, including motor-vehicle reports from counties around the country, police records, property records, birth and death certificates, marriage and divorce decrees and criminal and civil court filings. These records had long been publicly available, but automation and superfast computers meant that comprehensive data dossiers could be assembled in seconds. 
 ''It used to be that a business would have to go to 10 or 20 different vendors to get the same information that ChoicePoint sells in a single report,'' said Chris Jay Hoofnagle, a senior researcher at the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, and a privacy advocate. 
 That approach has certainly proved lucrative. The company's stock price has quadrupled in nine years, and its revenue has, too, topping $1 billion in 2005. That growth has come despite stiff competition from two other companies of similar size that market background information about ordinary Americans: Acxiom, a publicly traded company based in Little Rock, Ark., and the LexisNexis Group, a division of Reed Elsevier. Many smaller companies are also in the business. 
 ChoicePoint sees itself as playing an essential, if not noble, role in the information economy. It has -- at a reduced rate -- helped nonprofits working with children identify registered sex offenders who applied for jobs, and it has provided the data that allowed the police to track down hundreds of missing children. Mr. Curling and others inside ChoicePoint argue that if there were no data brokers, home loans would take that much longer to secure and insurance rates would be based not on a person's driving record but on broad demographic categories, such as age and gender. Sure, breaches have been a problem, but theirs is still a young industry, ChoicePoint executives say. 
 ''It takes time to establish best practices,'' Mr. Smith said. 
 It also took a state law. The data thieves who conned their way into ChoicePoint's system downloaded information about at least 166,000 individuals. In years past, the company would alert law enforcement officials when it suffered a data breach, according to Mr. Lee, and leave it at that. But under a California disclosure law passed in 2003, the company was required to notify every Californian whose personal details might have fallen into criminal hands. 
 ''No one knows for sure, and no one can say, how many breaches occurred before California,'' Mr. Hoofnagle said. ''This is an 'known unknown,' as Donald Rumsfeld would say.'' 
 RATHER than send letters only to the 42,000 Californians whose records had been downloaded by the fraudsters, ChoicePoint mailed a notice to all affected consumers, telling them that their personal information might have fallen into the hands of identity thieves. Critics chided ChoicePoint for waiting about five weeks to contact consumers, but the company said it first needed to set up and staff a call center to handle the anticipated deluge of complaints. 
 ''We knew that in all likelihood the first time that they were ever going to hear of ChoicePoint was in this letter,'' Mr. Lee said. 
 That would hardly be the last they would hear of ChoicePoint, however. Over the coming months, a long list of corporations and governmental agencies took their turn in the spotlight after they were obliged to acknowledge fumbling people's personal data: LexisNexis, Bank of America, Time Warner, Boeing, the Department of Veterans Affairs. And with each new breach, media accounts invariably mentioned the company whose breach had spurred a great awakening about the vulnerability of every individual's personal data -- even if that company, ChoicePoint, had nothing to do with the other companies' woes.
 Privacy critics were initially dubious when ChoicePoint contacted them in the wake of its February 2005 announcement. ''Most gave us the Heisman,'' said Mr. Lee, who held out his forearm like a running back pushing away a would-be tackler to demonstrate his point. Yet, over time, most though not all of the privacy posse would agree to meet with Mr. Curling and other ChoicePoint executives, and walk away impressed by what they heard and saw. 
 That would include Professor Solove at George Washington (''They've implemented quite a number of measures to protect privacy''), Chris Hoofnagle at Berkeley (''ChoicePoint now has model security practices'') and Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer advocacy group based in San Diego (''They've put in place practices that I wish all the data brokers would adopt''). 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, became an honorary member of the privacy posse when he declared the F.T.C. overly lenient for levying only a $10 million fine against ChoicePoint. But he, too, has changed his tune.
 ''I was worried that a fine would be seen as the cost of doing business,'' Mr. Schumer said in an interview. ''But I have to say, ChoicePoint has become a model company.'' 
 Even Marc Rotenberg, a privacy posse member who refused to meet privately with Mr. Curling or anyone from ChoicePoint out of concern that doing so would undermine his credibility, begrudgingly gave ChoicePoint some praise. ''While I'm prepared to give them credit for a series of positive steps, I don't think it would be accurate to say that they got to this position on their own,'' said Mr. Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy rights group in Washington. ''It took a lot of work by EPIC and other organizations.'' 
 When ChoicePoint started its makeover campaign, it first offered to rain down freebies on possible victims of identity theft, a protocol that others would follow. It invited them tojoin a credit monitoring service at no charge for one year, and provided them with free reports from the big three credit bureaus. To actual victims of identity theft, it offered its expertise to help correct the problem. 
 The company also gave a $1 million, four-year grant to the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit group in San Diego. 
 ChoicePoint then overhauled its security measures, a move that began with the hiring of Carol A. DiBattiste, who ultimately would fill the new position of chief privacy officer. Ms. DiBattiste is a no-nonsense lawyer whose resume includes 20 years in the Air Force and turns as an assistant United States attorney. To send the message that both security and privacy were a priority, Ms. DiBattiste was named the company's general counsel one year into her tenure
 Over the years, ChoicePoint had done a modest but lucrative business working with private investigators and other smaller enterprises. Shortly after its February 2005 announcement, the company said that it would no longer provide full Social Security numbers, birth dates or other sensitive information to these customers -- data that Ms. DiBattiste called ''keys to the castle.''
 That decision, Mr. Curling said, cost the company $15 million to $20 million last year. But inside ChoicePoint, executives saw that this small sliver of business threatened its overall reputation. 
 Until 2005, ChoicePoint had left credentialing to people in individual business units. It now has a centralized credentialing department. ''The salespeople play no role in credentialing anymore,'' said Ms. DiBattiste, who deployed dozens of people to take on the painstaking chore of recredentialing every client that was not either a law-enforcement agency or a public company. ChoicePoint had 120,000 accounts before February 2005; it now has 104,000.
 It also performs random audits of its customers, to ensure that they are conducting searches appropriate for their type of business, and it uses its computer systems to monitor accounts for suspicious activity. 
 ''We look for any anomalies,'' said Darryl Lemecha, the company's chief information officer. ''So if we see a 50-person company that typically does a background check like once a month suddenly do 20 in one day, we lock down that account so we can investigate.'' 
 ChoicePoint has endured roughly 100 outside audits, most of them conducted by long-term corporate customers, ''and we passed them all,'' Ms. DiBattiste said. As part of its settlement, ChoicePoint agreed to submit to an F.T.C. audit every other year for the next 20 years. 
 It is not yet clear how many people were actually harmed by ChoicePoint's negligence. ChoicePoint says it knows of only 46 people who have been defrauded because of its data breach. But law enforcement officials have identified at least 800 people who have been identity theft victims because of ChoicePoint's missteps, said Betsy Broder, an assistant director at the privacy and identity protection unit of the F.T.C. But, she said, that number could rise. 
 ''If data was stolen,'' Ms. Broder said, ''nothing prevents the thieves from holding on to it for a period of time and using it perhaps when consumers let down their guard, or when the alert on their credit expires.'' 
 ChoicePoint also set up a Web site for consumers who, at no cost, want to check and challenge possible inaccuracies in their dossiers (www.choicetrust.com). ''It's hard to overstate the significance of this,'' Ms. Givens said. ''This is an important step forward in moving us to transparency.''
 Whether other companies follow suit remains to be seen. Michael Dores, founder of Merlin Information Services, a ChoicePoint competitor based in Kalispell, Mont., said he would offer free consumer reviews of its dossiers -- but the cost, he said, ''would put me out of business.'' 
 STILL, Mr. Dores said, ChoicePoint's own woes have had a big impact on Merlin, whose customers tend to be smaller businesspeople like debt collectors and private investigators. Like ChoicePoint, Merlin was fooled into providing an account to a fraudster. 
 So the company has recredentialed all its customers, Mr. Dores said, and created a new two-person compliance department. He said that Merlin now gives detailed personal data only to a small fraction of those to whom it provided such sensitive information in the past, much to the chagrin of many longtime customers. 
 Mr. Dores said he felt that he had no choice but to put these changes into effect, because ''the Federal Trade Commission is in a bad mood over this stuff.''
 Members of the privacy posse still have their complaints about ChoicePoint. Roughly 60 percent of its business falls under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the collection and use of consumer credit information. But to Mr. Hoofnagle and other privacy advocates, that is not enough. ''If I had a magic wand I would make all of ChoicePoint's data fall under the Fair Credit Reporting Act,'' Mr. Hoofnagle said. 
 Even so, those who previously reserved most of their criticisms for ChoicePoint now aim their harshest words at some of its competitors. The same private investigators and others who formerly obtained Social Security numbers from ChoicePoint and Merlin are now simply seeking the services of other data brokers -- companies such as Tracers Information Specialists of Spring Hills, Fla.
 Yet Terry Kilburn, the chief operating officer of Tracers, said he was not worried about the hazards of providing such sensitive information. ''We weren't the ones who were breached,'' Mr. Kilburn said. ''Our security and compliance are strong, and so we are choosing to continue to do business the way we always have.''
 In Washington, legislators have proposed more than 20 bills to monitor data brokers more closely. According to Senator Schumer, ChoicePoint -- in contrast to other large data brokers -- has supported legislation he has proposed that would establish stricter security standards for any entity handling sensitive personal information.
 ''ChoicePoint, to its credit, got right behind our legislation and lobbied for it,'' Senator Schumer said. But the bill, which he and Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, introduced in April 2005, has not passed, he said, ''because a lot of other companies, quietly and behind the scenes, killed it.''

The Blind Side
Evolution of a Game.
By Michael Lewis.
299 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $24.95.
 Even if you think football consists primarily of two regrettable elements of life -- violence, punctuated by committee meetings, called huddles. Even if you wince at institutions of higher education engaging in the low practice of exploiting young, often black, men who emerge, after four years generating revenues for campus football factories, unscathed by education. Even if you think that if the Watergate and Iran-contra investigations had been really thorough they would have traced both scandals to connivings by college football coaches. Even if you think all those things, you are going to enjoy Michael Lewis's book ''The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game.'' Your enjoyment, however, will be tempered by dismay about some of what you learn.
Lewis tells an amazing true story in an appropriately mordant style, some samples of which are: 
 ''When the coaches walked into the living room of the Tuohys' lovely Memphis home, the first thing they saw was the Rebel Christmas tree: red and blue branches festooned with nothing but Ole Miss ornaments.'' 
 ''There were a number of colleges -- and Ole Miss was one of them -- for which the expropriation of the market value of pre-professional football players was something very like a core business.'' 
 ''Hugh was a football coach and so he tended to take an indulgent view of bad grades.'' 
 The Evangelical Christian School ''was as close to a church as a school could get. E.C.S. wouldn't accept kids unless both parents gave testimony of their experience of being born again -- and the stories better be good.''
 Lewis's subject is the salvation of Michael Oher, a black child virtually raised on the mean streets of Memphis. But Lewis also continues what he began with ''Moneyball,'' his 2003 best seller explaining new thinking about how to construct baseball teams. He is advancing a new genre of journalism that shows how market forces and economic reasoning shape the evolution of sports. Oher, who today plays left offensive tackle for the University of Mississippi, is a valuable commodity because of the lasting impact on football made by someone who played on the other side of the ball. 
 After the 1981 regular season, Lawrence Taylor, linebacker for the New York Giants, became the only rookie ever named the National Football League's defensive player of the year. He was 6-foot-3, 240 pounds and quick as a cat, running 40 yards in 4.5 seconds. He was, Lewis says, ''a new kind of athlete doing a new kind of thing.'' This is how Taylor described his thing: 
 ''I'll drive my helmet'' into the quarterback, ''or, if I can, I'll bring my arm up over my head and try to ax the sonuvabitch in two. So long as the guy is holding the ball, I intend to hurt him. ... If I hit the guy right, I'll hit a nerve and he'll feel electrocuted, he'll forget for a few seconds that he's on a football field.'' 
 Terrifying, disorienting and injuring quarterbacks is most of a linebacker's job description. Taylor concentrated coaches' minds on the problem of protecting quarterbacks. Most of them are right-handed, which means that when they are passing, threats from their left come thundering at them from their blind side. Hence the sudden interest in large and agile left offensive tackles. This interest intensified when Bill Walsh, coach of the San Francisco 49ers, devised the West Coast offense. It floods the secondary with receivers. More receivers mean fewer pass blockers, so the left tackle has more problems to cope with. 
 Which is why by 2004 the average salary of an N.F.L. left tackle was $5.5 million a year, second only to the average for quarterbacks. The five most highly paid left tackles were earning almost $3 million more than the five most highly paid right tackles. That is very good news for Oher, one of 13 siblings from the nation's third-poorest ZIP code.
 He had finished the 9th grade, but the 10th was unlikely, and he was on track to be selling drugs, en route to jail or an early grave. His father was long gone, his mother was in and out of drug rehab. In his file from the public school system -- he had been in 11 different schools in nine years -- the numbers looked, Lewis says, ''like misprints.'' His measured I.Q. was 80; his ''ability to learn'' placed him in the sixth percentile. He had repeated first and second grades. The school system said that through the fourth grade he had performed at ''grade level,'' which is odd because he never attended third grade. He was almost nonverbal. Essentially unparented throughout his childhood, he scavenged for clothes, slept here and there in (sometimes slightly) less disorganized households than that of his mother, who when Michael was 5 was caring for seven boys and three girls, all under 15. Caring, that is, in her fashion. And not at all for 10 or so days after the first of each month, when her welfare check arrived and she disappeared to feed her addiction to crack cocaine. On one occasion, lasting for weeks, his mother and seven boys slept in an old Chevy, washing themselves in a service station bathroom. For five years he lived in various households in a housing project with about a thousand residents and ''no two-parent families: zero.'' It is unsurprising that Oher, according to Lewis, became a teenager who ''didn't know what an ocean was, or a bird's nest, or the tooth fairy.'' 
 But the father of a friend, seeking a Christian education for his son, took Oher along on a visit to one of the many private schools created after the policy of forced busing, intended to achieve racial balance, provoked the departure of 7,000 children from Memphis's public schools. Oher came to the attention of Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy, parents of children at one of these schools. They are white; they are the religious right. 
 Taco Bell franchises had made Sean a lot of money. Nature had made Leigh Anne into a human firecracker, exploding with energy. Their evangelical Christianity made them receptive to the possibility of redemption in the here and now. And attending Ole Miss had made them football-crazy. They became Oher's legal guardians. (One of Leigh Anne's cousins called late one night: ''All right, I've just had my fifth beer. Who the hell is this black kid in y'all's Christmas card?'') They got Oher, with his 50-inch waist, into a size-58-long sport coat and into the Briarcrest Christian School. 
 When Oher wandered into the school gym, a coach tossed a basketball to him, expecting him to take it to the hoop, as a 6-foot-5 boy might, or kick it into the stands, as a 344-pound boy might. Instead, Oher caught it, dribbled three times between his legs, spun and drained a three-point shot from the corner of the floor. A human mountain with moves like a point guard? Two words spring to mind: left tackle. 
 Getting Oher his high school diploma became quite a project for the Tuohys. No one in Oher's family had ever had even a driver's license. When Leigh Anne told him to get his backpack from the foyer, he had no idea where that was. But with the help of tutors, by the first semester of his senior year he had risen to 162nd in a class of 163. ''He's picking them off one at a time,'' Sean crowed, ''like Sergeant York.'' The Tuohys found some interesting ways of getting high school credits off the Internet. (Lewis calls the Brigham Young University program of correspondence courses ''the great Mormon grade-grab.'' Sean, evangelical but broad-minded, says: ''The Mormons may be going to hell. But they really are nice people.'') Anyway, Oher satisfied N.C.A.A. criteria for college eligibility.
 Oher's childhood of grinding deprivation might have put him on a path to riches. Lewis commits some perhaps dubious sociology when he declares that a miserable ghetto childhood can be excellent preparation for football: ''It made you angry, it made you aggressive, it made you want to tear someone's head off. The N.F.L. was loaded with players who had mined a loveless, dysfunctional childhood for sensational acts of violence.'' 
 Be that as it may, there came a day when a bevy of assistant football coaches from the Southeastern Conference, the Big Ten, the Atlantic Coast Conference and elsewhere came to a Briarcrest practice. There Oher and a wee 270-pound teammate faced off, one on one, for a demonstration collision. In an instant, Oher effortlessly shoved his teammate down the field. In a flash, the coaches fired up their cellphones. Lewis says the Clemson coach rushed up to Oher's coach, saying, ''I seen all I need to see,'' and added that Oher could have a full scholarship. Later, Tennessee's head coach watched Michael for half an hour and pronounced him the nation's best. A national recruiting frenzy had begun, from schools in states Michael could not find on a map. 
 When Ole Miss introduced its new football coach, he announced that his first goal was to recruit Oher. The coach barged into the Tuohys' living room, took a gander at Oher and exclaimed, as Lewis renders it, ''YAAAWWW BEEE BAAWWW!'' (''You a big boy!'') Michael could not understand a word he said. That did not matter. He wanted to go to Ole Miss, where his newfound parents had gone. 
 There Sean Tuohy told the coach, Ed Orgeron, that Oher would have trouble learning plays from a book full of X's and O's, but could learn the plays if they were presented visually, using mustard bottles and ketchup bottles to represent players. Lewis reports:
 '' 'Coach,' said Sean. 'My faith believes that the Lord sends down gifts for everyone and our job is to find those gifts. Michael's gift is the gift of memory. When he knows it, he knows it.'
 ''Coach O stopped scribbling and looked up. 'I'm going to tell you one thing, Sean,' he bellowed. 'He's got some pretty good [expletive] feet, too. You seen them feet? Now them feet: that's a [expletive] gift!' '' 
 Oher was not a whale out of water at Ole Miss. Lewis says that the typical football player in Michael's college class ''had third-grade-level reading skills. Several had never taken math. Ever.'' Michael's three closest friends among his Ole Miss teammates had children. One had become a father at 15. Michael brought a teammate, Quentin Taylor, to the Tuohys' home for Thanksgiving, and Taylor mentioned that he had fathered three children by two different mothers. Lewis writes: 
 ''Leigh Anne pulled the carving knife from the turkey and said, 'Quentin, you can do what you want and it's your own business. But if Michael Oher does that I'm cutting his penis off.' From the look on Quentin's face Michael could see he didn't think she was joking.'' 
 She probably wasn't. She and Sean seriously, ferociously, implacably care about Oher. They were the first adults to do so. 
 Last season Michael was named to the first-team freshman all-American team -- as a ''true freshman.'' That is college-football-speak for a player who is not ''redshirted.'' And that is college-football-speak for holding a player out of competition for a year while he spends time in the center of his academic life -- no, silly, not the library, the weight room. 
 On Friday nights, American high schools discover talent that universities refine on Saturdays, for the nation's eventual delight on Sundays. Oher's story is not pretty, but Lewis tells it well -- and against all odds, it may be heading for a happy ending.

HEADLINE: Clare Cusack, Michael Gianaris

 BODY:
Clare M. Cusack and Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris are to be married this afternoon at St. Catherine and St. George Greek Orthodox Church in Astoria, Queens. The Rev. Alexander Karloutsos, a Greek Orthodox priest, will perform the ceremony with the Rev. Joseph McShane, a Roman Catholic priest and the president of Fordham, participating. 
 The bride, 32, is a litigation associate in the Manhattan office of the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius. She graduated from the State University of New York at Geneseo and received a law degree from Fordham. She is a daughter of James P. Cusack of South Setauket, N.Y., and the late Margaret W. Cusack. Her father has retired as an administrative assistant at the Isabel Rooney Middle School in the Bronx. Her mother taught chemistry, earth science and calculus at Eastport High School in Eastport, N.Y.
The bridegroom, 36, was elected in 2000 to the state legislature. He is a Democrat who ran unopposed for reelection last week in the 36th District in Queens, which includes Astoria and Long Island City. He is also finance chairman of the New York State Democratic Party. He graduated summa cum laude from Fordham and received a law degree from Harvard. He is a son of Magdalene Gianaris and Nicholas V. Gianaris of Astoria. His father is a professor of economics and statistics at Fordham. 
 The couple met nine years ago when they were both working for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. ''My mother got sick in 2000,'' Ms. Cusack said, just when Mr. Gianaris was running for the Assembly. ''He was very busy, but I needed a good friend. It didn't matter what he was doing, he would drop everything.''
 ''It takes a while to start dating when you are already friends with someone,'' she added, describing the transition to romance. ''But as soon as we did, there was no question that this was my partner.''

HEADLINE: American Pie From a Korean Kitchen

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
MY family has a favorite recipe for sugar cookies, which we bake for nearly every holiday. We decorate the round shapes with orange frosting for Halloween, colorful sprinkles at Christmas and red sugar on Valentine's Day.
 This is not unlike the auto industry's approach to the minivan. You'll find the same basic recipe no matter which carmaker's kitchen is doing the baking, and the shapes are formed with cookie cutters that vary only slightly.
The minivans most popular among Americans differ mainly in their decorations, and companies that stray from the family-tested formula have usually paid the price for being different: think of the wedge-shape Dustbusters from General Motors; Toyota's Jetsons-style jellybean, the Previa; and most recently, the quirky Nissan Quest. 
 So it's no wonder that the master of automotive knockoffs, Hyundai Motor of South Korea, took no chances with its latest vans. It stuck to the recipe -- no substitutions. 
 Hyundai Motor is the parent of both the Hyundai and Kia brands. The first Korean minivan in the American market was the original Kia Sedona, introduced in the summer of 2001 as a 2002 model. The Sedona proved popular as a lower-price alternative to vans from leading American and Japanese companies, and it received a number of awards based on customer feedback, particularly for its overall value. 
 For the 2006 model year, the Sedona was redesigned and built on a new, larger platform. This revamped Sedona also served as the basis for Hyundai's first American minivan, the Entourage, introduced as a 2007 model last spring. Both are imported from South Korea.
 The Entourage was nearly stillborn. A year and a half ago, Hyundai abruptly canceled plans to make its own version of the Sedona, deciding to develop a car-based crossover utility wagon instead. But immediately after the decision was announced, gasoline prices spiked and the company watched as buyers of full-size S.U.V.'s switched to minivans. 
 Since the development of the Entourage was nearly complete, Hyundai quickly reversed itself and resurrected its van plans.
 How long the Entourage will remain in Hyundai's line is unclear. In the future, Hyundai officials say the company will focus more on car-based crossovers, like the Veracruz to be introduced next year, though the Entourage could stay in production alongside the new crossovers.
 In the long run, a big challenge for both Hyundai and Kia will be making good on their promises to build distinctly different vehicles on shared platforms, instead of simply affixing different grilles and badges.
 For now, the Entourage is identical to the Sedona, except for cosmetics and the packaging of a few features. The vans are also similar in shape, dimensions, powertrains, performance and features to models from Honda, Toyota and Chrysler.
 While neither strays from the accepted formula, the Sedona and Entourage have clean, classy styling with sculptured shapes and creases that add a crisp touch. Differences between the two do not extend much beyond the grilles and badges.
 Inside, the look is equally clean and contemporary. Controls and gauges are laid out logically, in a style typical of most minivans. The new Sedona is roomier than the model it replaces, thanks to significant increases in wheelbase, overall length and width. 
 Kia plans to add a shorter five-seat version by year-end, but for now, the Sedona and Entourage come with seats for seven -- two captain's chairs in each of the first two rows and a third-row bench. The second-row seats flip and fold for access to the third row. The split rear bench folds into a well in the floor, a feature pioneered by Honda. 
 The various rows have their own climate controls, and the windows in the rear doors power open and closed. Power sliding doors and a power liftgate are options; they all open and close with the push of a button on the dashboard or the key fob.
 The Sedona and Entourage have 14 cup holders and a lot of the nooks, crannies and storage units that van customers expect. 
 Like most minivans, these are driven by the front wheels, and they are powered by the same 3.8-liter V-6 engine with dual overhead camshafts, paired with a modern five-speed automatic transmission. The engine puts out 250 horsepower, compared with the Odyssey's 244 and the Sienna's class-leading 266. The Sedona and Entourage also lead in torque, with 253 pound-feet, though they do not feel as lively as their Honda and Toyota rivals.
 The federal economy rating -- 18 miles a gallon in town and 25 on the highway -- is on par in this class. 
 The ride is quite comfortable, and the handling poses no surprises. In their native habitat, the school parking lot, the vans feel nimble enough.
 The Sedona and Entourage match the Odyssey in offering a full range of standard safety features, including antilock brakes, side air bags for the front seats, side curtain bags for head protection in all three rows, traction control and stability control. In addition, the Sedona received top ratings in government crash tests. 
 Both vans also offer the latest minivan features, either as standard equipment or options: DVD player with wireless headphones, premium audio system with MP3 capability, HomeLink transmitter for opening gates and garage doors, adjustable pedals, seat heaters and a backup warning system. Still, the Sedona and Entourage fall short of their competitors by not offering a satellite navigation system. 
 In keeping with the approach that has bought them success, Kia and Hyundai charge less than their competitors. They also offer some of the industry's longest warranties. The Sedona that I tested, a base LX, was well equipped even without options. Its list price, including delivery charges, was $23,895. A fancier version, the EX, is $27,495. The Entourage, which comes as the base GLS, midlevel SE and top-of-the-line Limited, starts at $24,995.
 A fully equipped Sedona or Entourage just breaks $30,000, whereas the best-dressed Odysseys and Siennas can climb to $40,000.
 What the buyer doesn't get with the Kia or Hyundai are the solid-gold names of Honda and Toyota, though the Korean brands have scored well in recent quality surveys. Nor will you find the same craftsmanship in the cabin or the superb refinement of things like the seat mechanisms. The powertrain is not as buttery smooth.
 Still, for the budget-minded, the Kia and Hyundai minivans hit close to the bull's eye. A shopper may well conclude that the price, which is likely to be a couple of thousand dollars less than the class leaders, is reason enough to accept some rather small sacrifices in refinement.

HEADLINE: You Can Make 'Em Like They Used To

BYLINE: By DAVE KEHR

 BODY:
IN 1989 an unknown 26-year-old filmmaker from Louisiana delivered what might have been the final blow to the shaky edifice known as the Hollywood studio system. Steven Soderbergh's ''Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' an independently financed tale of love and adultery, won the grand prize of the Cannes Film Festival, the Palme d'Or, as well as an acting prize for one of its stars, James Spader. 
 Acquired by the fledging distribution company Miramax, the film, made with a reported budget of $1.2 million, went on to gross almost $25 million in the United States, a spectacular figure that put Miramax on the map and established American independent film as a force to be reckoned with. As they watched their ancient hegemony crumble away, the studios rushed to establish their own ''independent'' divisions. 
Now, 17 years later, Mr. Soderbergh is back with a movie that means to make amends. ''I often think I would have been so happy to be Michael Curtiz,'' Mr. Soderbergh said. Mr. Curtiz, the contract director, made more than 100 films for Warner Brothers, including ''Casablanca'' and ''Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' between his arrival in Hollywood from Hungary in 1926 and his death in 1962. ''That would have been right up my alley,'' Mr. Soderbergh said, ''making a couple of movies a year of all different kinds, working with the best technicians. I would have been in heaven, just going in to work every day.''
 ''The Good German,'' which Mr. Soderbergh directed for Warner Brothers, reimagines what it would be like to make a movie under the studio system of old. Based on the novel by Joseph Kanon -- a thriller with a conscience about an American war correspondent (George Clooney) who returns to the rubble of postwar Berlin to find the German woman (Cate Blanchett) who was once his lover -- the movie, which opens in limited release on Dec. 15, is both set in 1946 and, in a sense, filmed there as well. 
 During the production Mr. Soderbergh was committed to remaining as true as possible to the technique of the era. By reproducing the conditions of an actual studio shoot from the late 1940s, he hoped to enter the mind of a filmmaker like Mr. Curtiz, to explore the strengths and limitations of a classical style that has now largely been lost. 
 ''For weeks, for all of us, it was like living in a time warp,'' Mr. Soderbergh said by telephone from Los Angeles, where he was finishing filming ''Ocean's Thirteen,'' the third in a series and an unabashedly commercial movie that will be one of Warner Brothers' major summer releases. 
 There have been many attempts to recapture the look of old Hollywood over the years, most of them disappointingly superficial: films that begin in black and white but quickly bleed into color, while never straying far from a contemporary vocabulary of close-ups and meandering Steadicam shots. Not only does ''The Good German'' stick to its monochromatic principles throughout, it uses other elements of '40s style that may not be apparent at first. 
 The strongly accented camera angles, the dramatic nonrealistic lighting, the way actors move against each other within the frame and the way the camera travels across the set -- these are all elements of a vocabulary that has been lost in the post-television era. In ''The Good German,'' Mr. Soderbergh is trying to bring this vocabulary back. 
 ''We set up our little guidelines,'' he said. For one, he banned the sophisticated zoom lenses that make life easier for today's cinematographers, returning to the fixed focal-length lenses of the past. ''I did some research and found some script continuities for a couple of Michael Curtiz films,'' he recalled, referring to records of the lens and exposure used in every shot, in case retakes were necessary. ''I found that he restricted himself to at most five lenses, usually three or four. I talked to Panavision, and they happened to have some older lenses that they'd made that didn't have all the new coatings on them and also were a focal length that isn't really used anymore. One of them was a 32 millimeter, a wide-angle lens that nobody uses anymore but was one that Curtiz used a lot.'' 
 For audiences the shorter lenses mean a wider field of vision, expanding the camera's range beyond the tight close-ups and two-shots that define today's television-influenced filmmaking. With the wider range, groups of three, four or more characters can appear together on screen, minimizing the need for cross-cutting, which creates a different kind of interaction among the actors and a more expressive sense of the fictional space they inhabit. 
 They also used only incandescent lights, Mr. Soderbergh said, and no wireless microphones at all. Where many, if not most, filmmakers use ''body mikes'' to capture the intimate whispers of dialogue, Mr. Soderbergh recorded his sound the old-fashioned way, through a boom microphone held just over the actors' heads by a technician standing out of camera range. 
 ''The rule was, if you can't do it with a boom mike, then you can't do it,'' Mr. Soderbergh said. ''Which was helpful to me because, in talking to the actors about this very externalized performance mode I was going to ask them to assume, it helped to be able to say, 'You have to talk louder, you have to project more, because I'm not getting a good enough track.' '' 
 Unlike the Method mumble currently in style in American movies, the dialogue in ''The Good German'' is spoken in crisp, clearly enunciated stage English, emphasizing presentation over interpretation. 
 ''I don't feel like I'm a real quiet actor in terms of my projection in the first place,'' said Tobey Maguire, who plays a crucial supporting role as an American serviceman with sinister black-market connections. ''So I didn't really think much about that part of it. But what was fascinating to me is how he was cutting the movie in his head. There's really no fat on the film. He really didn't do 'coverage.' He only shot the parts of the scene he was going to use, and if he wasn't going to use it, he didn't shoot it.'' 
 ''The pace was unbelievably fast,'' he added. ''So that was great.''
 If there is a single word that sums up the difference between filmmaking at the middle of the 20th century and the filmmaking of today, it is ''coverage.'' Derived from television, it refers to the increasingly common practice of using multiple cameras for a scene (just as television would cover a football game) and having the actors run through a complete sequence in a few different registers. The lighting tends to be bright and diffused, without shadows, which makes it easier for the different cameras to capture matching images. 
 The advantage for directors is that they no longer need to make hard and fast decisions about where the camera will go for a particular scene or how the performances will be pitched. The idea is to pump as much coverage as possible into the editing room, where the final decisions about what goes where will be made. 
 The danger for a director is that with so much material available, the original vision may be drowned or never really defined; and the sheer amount of exposed film makes it possible for executives to step in (after the director has completed his union-mandated first cut) and rearrange the material to follow the latest market-research reports. 
 During the studio era it was more typical for directors to arrive on the set, block out their shots and light them with the use of stand-ins; the actors were then summoned from their dressing rooms and, after a brief rehearsal, they would film the lines needed in the individual shot. The crew would then break down the camera and move it to the next setup, as determined by the director. 
 ''That kind of staging is a lost art,'' Mr. Soderbergh said, ''which is too bad. The reason they no longer work that way is because it means making choices, real choices, and sticking to them. It means shooting things in a way that basically only cut together in one order. That's not what people do now. They want all the options they can get in the editing room.'' 
 While the editing process now routinely takes months, ''I had a pretty polished cut of 'The Good German' two days after we wrapped,'' Mr. Soderbergh said. ''It was shot to go together very, very specifically.''
 ''The geography of the scene -- to me, that's the job,'' Mr. Soderbergh added, ''carrying all of that around in your mind. Sure, I've used multiple cameras on other pictures. On 'Traffic,' which was from the get-go designed to be a run-and-gun movie, we were using two cameras a lot, but even in those situations you can make choices in terms of the placement of the camera, and how you think the stuff will cut together.'' And because Mr. Soderbergh works both as his own cinematographer (under the name Peter Andrews) and editor (as Mary Ann Bernard), he can make spontaneous decisions: ''There's no gap between figuring out what we want to do and executing it.'' 
 ''The Good German'' has turned out, in its way, to be a highly experimental picture, but one that grew out of economic necessity. ''They bought the novel in 2001, thinking the role of the reporter might make a good vehicle for George Clooney,'' said the screenwriter, Paul Attanasio. ''I got the novel in April of 2001, and I think we sat down for the first time in May. From the beginning Steven was talking about it as a film noir, which if you've read the novel, is not really what it is. The decision to make it as a film of the period came later, when he got down to deciding to make the movie.'' 
 Mr. Soderbergh added: ''For a while I thought about doing it normally. And then I realized that actually the most economical way to do it would be the way we ended up doing it, shooting it in black and white, so we could incorporate all of the stock footage we had found. Because if we'd shot it in color and tried to go to Germany, it would have cost two and a half times what it did. Luckily the studio went along with it. Our budget was for $32 million, and they felt the number was not dangerously high.''
 Mr. Soderbergh's team combed the studios for stock film of postwar Berlin; one trove was Paramount, where he found some of the background scenes used for ''A Foreign Affair,'' a Billy Wilder film set in Berlin in 1948. But it was left to Mr. Soderbergh's longtime production designer, Philip Messina, to build the rest of Berlin in Hollywood -- or Burbank, to be more precise, where they took over some standing sets on the Universal back lot and dressed them in appropriate rubble. 
 ''There's very little computer graphics used to extend the image, and mostly what you see on the screen is what we were able to accomplish practically,'' Mr. Messina said. ''The heaps of rubble were made from steel armatures with carved foam on top of them and rocks stuck on them. We moved them from the back lots to the sets and used them over and over, like a kit of parts we were constantly rearranging.''
 Louise Frogley, who has worked as Mr. Soderbergh's costume designer since ''The Limey'' in 1999, assembled the wardrobe much as it would have been done in the '40s, first raiding the costume warehouses at Warner Brothers, and later traveling to the Sturm costume factory in East Berlin, where military uniforms of various periods are copied and reproduced for films.
 ''It's in an old sugar factory, and each floor is a different army, a different military setup,'' she said. ''We found quite a lot of original police uniforms. All sorts of things came up: I didn't realize that the uniforms the police wore were the same as they used under the Nazis, but they shaved off the swastikas.'' 
 Ms Frogley continued: ''The civilians were much easier to dress. George Clooney was great, because he really gets how people wore their trousers high during that period, instead of pushing them down to their hips like they do now.''
 Both Mr. Messina and Ms. Frogley are already at work on Mr. Soderbergh's next project, a two-part biography of Che Guevara that will star Benicio Del Toro and be shot entirely in Spanish (another notion unlikely to thrill the Hollywood establishment, which likes foreign-language films almost as much as it likes black-and-white ones). Such leapfrogging is typical of Mr. Soderbergh's methods: he likes to keep working constantly and is happy to use the down time on one movie to get a head start on the next. In 2006 alone he has served as an executive producer on two films (Richard Linklater's ''Scanner Darkly'' and Scott Z. Burns' ''The Half Life of Timofey Berezin''), completed and released ''The Good German'' and filmed ''Ocean's Thirteen.'' 
 Studios may no longer be in the business of providing long-term employment for filmmakers, but Mr. Soderbergh seems to be functioning as a studio all by himself. 
 ''You hope that there's a way of putting a film like this across,'' he said of ''The Good German.'' ''And just not for yourself. If a movie like this can get made and actually bring in a little bit of money, it means that someone else can make one too. I'm just hoping that we can find a way to the audience so that the person in line behind me who's trying to get Warners to do something off track can point to 'The Good German' and say, 'You know, that worked, let's try this now.' ''

HEADLINE: Gridlock? It Doesn't Bother the Market 

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The possibility of two years of gridlock in Washington evidently emboldened the stock market, which rose last week for the sixth time in the last seven weeks. 
 Wall Street took a sanguine view of Tuesday's election, with many strategists predicting that a divided government would accomplish little -- and that this would be good for the federal budget and for the economy.
Tech stocks soared after Cisco Systems, the maker of computer networking equipment, forecast Thursday that its sales would be faster-paced because of demand for high-speed Internet and video. Cisco, with a weekly gain of 12.5 percent, was the third-best performer in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. It trailed a rival, Juniper Networks, which gained 15.8 percent for the week, and Goodyear Tire, which rose 17.9 percent, on a stronger-than-expected earnings report.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 122.39 points, or 1 percent, to close at 12,108.43. The S.& P. 500 climbed 16.60 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 1,380.90. The Nasdaq composite index leaped 58.93 points, or 2.5 percent, to close at 2,389.72. 
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell sharply, to 4.59 percent from 4.71 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

GRAND ILLUSION
The Untold Story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11.
By Wayne Barrett and Dan Collins.
390 pp. HarperCollins Publishers. $25.95.
 One has to go back a long way in New York's history to find a mayor who left office with his reputation intact -- trying to govern the ungovernable city will do that to you -- and for a while, at least, it looked as if Rudy Giuliani were destined for the same fate. Setting aside the tawdry manner in which his marriage had (publicly) unraveled, the mayor's combative style had begun to grate on many New Yorkers. But in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the very qualities that had grown so wearisome -- the pride, the willfulness, the born prosecutor's gift for moral clarity and indignation-fueled rhetoric -- turned Giuliani into the perfect hero. He was now, among the many reverential monikers bestowed on him during those fraught post-9/11 days, America's Mayor, America's Churchill or, simply, Rudy the Rock. 
Five years later, Giuliani's stature is not quite what it was -- how could it be? -- but he still looms large, which is to say that Wayne Barrett and Dan Collins had their work cut out for them when they set out to write ''Grand Illusion: The Untold Story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11.'' The constipated-looking cover photo of the former mayor and likely 2008 presidential candidate offers a pretty clear indication of the beat-down to come. Aside from the occasional halfhearted qualifier -- the acknowledgment, say, that Giuliani was acting ''under terrible pressure'' on 9/11 -- the authors betray few traces of ambivalence about their subject as they hammer away at his handling of the events with which he will forever be linked in the nation's collective conscious.
 By their reckoning, Giuliani is guilty of sins of both commission and omission, beginning with his failure to heed the warnings of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, a failure that, they argue, left the city unprepared for the attacks. The authors describe the many prophylactic measures the mayor failed to take that could have mitigated the loss of lives, charging, among other things, that replacing the Fire Department's outdated radios might have enabled more firefighters to receive evacuation orders before the buildings started to fall. They also maintain that after 9/11 Giuliani actively cultivated the myth of his heroism -- ''I didn't have time to be afraid, Oprah'' -- and indeed cashed in on it when he reinvented himself as a ''hero for hire,'' creating a firm specializing in crisis management.
 Giuliani and many of his political allies declined to cooperate with the authors -- no surprise, given that Barrett's previous book was an unauthorized and unflattering biography of the former mayor. A longtime veteran of The Village Voice, Barrett belongs to a dying breed, the old-fashioned New York City muckrakers. He and Collins, a co-author of ''I, Koch'' and a senior producer at CBSNews.com, obviously did a prodigious amount of research -- the name of their research assistant, Anna Lenzer, appears as prominently as theirs on the title page -- but because a good deal of their reporting is fairly technical, delving into the intricacies of radio frequencies and the city's byzantine fire codes, it's often difficult to discern whether a particular part of their story really is, as the subtitle puts it, untold.
 Nonetheless, Barrett and Collins marshal some provocative arguments. It's not hard to believe, for instance, that the mayor's antagonistic relationship with the Port Authority, which held the lease to the twin towers until the summer of 2001, led him to be more interested in finding ways to humiliate the authority than in pressing it to make New York's tallest buildings safer. And the authors surely are right to say that situating the vaunted Office of Emergency Management in 7 World Trade Center, across the street from an obvious terrorist target, was a mistake. That said, it's hardly necessary to point out that 9/11 took the entire nation by surprise; had Giuliani undertaken to prepare the city for an attack even approaching that scale, he would surely have been denounced as a fearmonger.
 Barrett and Collins are on firmer ground when they dissect Giuliani's post-9/11 performance, in particular his reluctance to acknowledge any mistakes. Still, the book's relentlessly hostile tone undermines the authors' case. ''Grand Illusion'' would have been more resonant, if less controversial, had they devoted at least some attention to the historical context in which Giuliani was acting, both before 9/11, when he was preoccupied with trying to reduce crime and stabilize the city's economy, and after, when he was caught up in the emotional swirl of the moment. The authors describe the mayor's obsessive desire to get the site cleaned up in 180 days as ''a deadline in search of a reason,'' but that analysis ignores the powerful need for healing New Yorkers felt after the attacks. History has already shown that Giuliani erred -- grievously -- by rushing the cleanup and thus failing to recognize that ground zero was filled with potentially lethal toxins, but he did not make this decision in a vacuum.
 With America's Mayor presumably preparing to run for higher office, it may well be the right time to reconsider his 9/11 legacy. ''Grand Illusion'' will contribute to the debate, but the definitive, nuanced portrait that captures both what Giuliani did right and what he did wrong remains to be written.

HEADLINE: A Wild and Uncrazy Guy

BYLINE: By Lynn Hirschberg. 
Lynn Hirschberg, editor at large for the magazine, writes regularly about Hollywood and film.

 BODY:
Will Ferrell used to apologize for being normal. He knew that comedians were traditionally angst-ridden, misunderstood misfits who survived unhappy childhoods by masking their pain and anger with humor. Comedy was an outlet and a remedy for their rage or melancholy or fear. From Richard Pryor to Woody Allen to Jim Carrey, they all had their demons. ''I have no interesting demons,'' Ferrell told me on a sunny early-autumn day in Hollywood. He was folded into a low leather chair in his sparsely furnished office at Gary Sanchez Productions. He and his writing partner, Adam McKay, who directed the movie ''Talladega Nights,'' a Nascar sendup that stars Ferrell and is the most successful comedy of the year, had just moved their operations into this two-story bungalow. A housewarming gift from Ferrell's agents -- a specially commissioned photograph of a group of professional baseball players with their middle fingers extended -- was leaning in its frame against an empty bookshelf. Ferrell was, as he often is, wearing loose khaki shorts, a T-shirt and sneakers. He is 6-foot-3 and rangy, with a broad torso, but he is economical in his movements. There's a stillness about him that is surprising. 
''I was never the class clown,'' Ferrell said, listing the reasons that he is an unlikely comedian. ''I was popular in high school and in college. I was good at sports. I've always been a 'but look, the glass is half-full' kind of guy. I used to worry that I wasn't crazy enough to succeed in comedy. Or troubled enough. In the beginning, people were surprised that a seemingly mild-mannered person could bring a script or a character to life.'' He paused, suddenly looking a little giddy. ''But I'm not above throwing a chair out a window just to see what happens,'' he said. ''I may not have demons, but I am kind of immune to inhibitions.''
 Over the past decade, Ferrell, who is 39, has pioneered a comedic sensibility that is in sync with a prevailing spirit of cheerful mediocrity in America. In all his various incarnations -- from the characters he spoofed on ''Saturday Night Live,'' on which he starred from 1995 to 2002, to the roles he has played in movies like ''Old School'' (which made $87 million in worldwide box office in 2003), ''Anchorman'' ($90 million in 2004) and ''Talladega Nights'' ($162 million so far) -- he has perfected a version of the likable, suburban-born-and-bred, not-too-smart guy who likes to hang out with his friends, doesn't particularly want to grow up (even if he's married) and is happily oblivious to his own ridiculousness. Ferrell grew up in Irvine, Calif., a middle-class Republican community, and he was in a fraternity at U.S.C. Between the two experiences, he knows his characters and he knows his audience. ''I have a love of suburban, lame white people,'' Ferrell told me earlier. ''I think I know what makes them funny.''
 In recent years, comedies have become one of the few cinematic genres that are consistently successful at the box office. In 2003, ''Elf,'' which starred Ferrell as a Santa's helper who journeys from the North Pole to Manhattan in search of his father, earned $26.3 million in its second week of release (compared with $16.4 million for the highly anticipated ''The Matrix Revolutions''), and the industry took notice. ''Elf'' went on to make $220 million, and suddenly the studios were looking to invest in low-budget comedies. The success of these comedies and the box-office clout of their stars have allowed Ferrell to branch out. On Friday, ''Stranger Than Fiction,'' in which Ferrell plays a more restrained version of his usual white-guy persona, opened nationwide. ''I was afraid that Will would be crazy because he is a comedian,'' Marc Forster, the director of ''Stranger Than Fiction,'' told me. ''But he is so normal that it is surprising.''
 Although Ferrell has made a slight departure with ''Stranger Than Fiction,'' his main interest remains comedies that are rooted in group improvisation. ''There are really only two ways to get into comedy: stand-up or improvisational comedy,'' explains Judd Apatow, who directed ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'' and who, like seemingly everyone in Hollywood's comedy universe, is friends with Ferrell and McKay. ''Jim Carrey, Steve Martin, Woody Allen -- those guys came out of stand-up, and they have a finely honed, particular personality to their comedy. Will comes out of improv, which means he enjoys playing different characters and collaboration and camaraderie. It also means being funny in the moment. That's part of the improv tradition: comedy as it's happening now, without a lot of takes, when it's still fun. Since 9/11, there's an anxiety out there in the world, and Will offers another way of seeing. He's like you, but funnier and without worries.''
 At the beginning of his career, Ferrell tried his hand at stand-up but found it too solitary an existence. ''I would open my act by singing the theme music from 'Star Trek,' '' he recalled, as he sang the music from ''Star Trek.'' McKay, who was also wearing shorts and is also tall, came into the room. ''It's kind of high notes, and I did it straight,'' Ferrell went on. ''And then my big funny button on it was 'I'm able to sing that because I have no testicles.' ''
 McKay laughed. ''I didn't bomb too many times,'' Ferrell said, ''but I preferred the safety in numbers of theater. As a kid, I played more like a girl than a boy. Traditionally, little girls play in groups and boys play king of the hill. For some reason, I liked to share. I was never the kid who had to be reminded to pass the ball.''
 Ferrell and McKay met on ''Saturday Night Live,'' where McKay was a writer. Initially, McKay said, he underestimated Ferrell. ''I thought Will was there to be the straight man in the sketches,'' he remembered. ''But at the first read-through for our first show, he blew everyone away. We all started writing for him because he could do absolutely everything.'' McKay paused. ''And everyone was always saying how nice he was. But Will's really not that nice. He likes to cause trouble. You know, when Will was at U.S.C., he tried to convince his frat that they should turn gay. He told them it would promote brotherhood and that they could save money on beer because there would be no women around to drink it.''
 Ferrell laughed. ''Half the guys really thought I was serious,'' he said, sounding a little jubilant. ''They found no humor in the idea whatsoever.''
 McKay and Ferrell began writing together at ''S.N.L.,'' and when McKay left the show and moved to Los Angeles, Ferrell followed. Their writing method still draws on the free-form creativity of their ''S.N.L.'' past. ''Will types and I lie down on the couch,'' McKay explained. Ferrell added: ''We improvise the themes. That will slowly digress into, Did you read that thing in the paper? We've had days where we're, like, O.K. -- last interruption -- this is the last time I'll talk about the Lakers, but what are they doing? We really do an expert job of not being too hard on ourselves if we have a day that we totally blow because we just have to talk about other stuff. Usually, the next day we'll hit the ground running.''
 This is the dream of American men: wear shorts, make millions, goof around with your friends, be hilarious. What's more, you get to be part of a clique of like-minded comic actors, writers and directors who trade ideas, appraise one another's work and appear in one another's films. One of Ferrell and McKay's first collaborations was ''Anchorman,'' a movie set in San Diego in the '70s that revolves around a local TV news anchor and his professional cohort. In one scene, the anchor, Ron Burgundy, and his network-news team are challenged to a rumble by rival newsmen played by, among others, Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller, three of the reigning stars of comedy. So goes the current comedy community, which is close-knit and supportive: Ferrell showed up in a surprise cameo with Owen Wilson and Vaughn in ''The Wedding Crashers''; Apatow helped out as a producer on ''Anchorman.'' ''The hardest part about doing this job is you get no sympathy from your wife when you say how hard your day was,'' Apatow says. ''They know that a writing session is pizza and YouTube and hanging out with your friends. The conventional wisdom is that men want to be funny to get girls, and that's true. But guys also want to be funny to make their friends laugh. Comedians, especially, enjoy each other's company. Or at least, this generation does.''
 Ferrell and McKay certainly do amuse themselves. When they signed a two-year deal in June with Paramount Vantage to produce relatively low-budget comedies, they announced to Variety that their new venture -- Gary Sanchez Productions -- was named after an ex-N.F.L. kicker from Paraguay. They said that Sanchez, whom they claimed they met on a cruise, would finance their company. ''With Mr. Sanchez's support and vision, we look forward to a long and productive partnership,'' Ferrell informed Variety. ''Viva Paraguay!'' Ferrell and McKay posed with ''Sanchez'' for several full-page ads, one of which ran with the following statement from him: ''Will Ferrell and Adam McKay are my friends. Do not harm them. Or I will put you in an abandoned refrigerator full of cobras.''
 ''The quote may have been too much,'' McKay said. The reporter from Variety, who wasn't sure whether Sanchez existed, was apparently not amused. ''I told you -- Will Ferrell is not nice,'' McKay laughed. ''He is much more dangerous than he looks. The man is completely fearless.''
 In the 2000 presidential election, Ferrell voted for Al Gore. This would not have been especially noteworthy if at the time he hadn't been impersonating George W. Bush every week on ''Saturday Night Live.'' His depiction of Bush as an inarticulate, slightly addled frat boy who spoke about ''strategery'' and about his wish to emerge ''victoriant'' played no small part in defining the public persona of the real Bush. In one particularly memorable sketch, actors playing Gore and Jeb Bush debated the country's future while Ferrell, as Bush, the soon-to-be president, stood in the corner of the room playing with a ball of string like a contented cat.
 Not long after that sketch, ''S.N.L.'' ran a prime-time election special, and Bush and Gore themselves visited the studio. ''It was that strange sensation when art and life collide,'' Lorne Michaels, the producer of ''Saturday Night Live,'' told me on the phone from his office at NBC. ''There were the two candidates making fun of themselves to the actors who were playing them. Will, especially, captured something essential about Bush, and because Will is so likable, I believe, he tilted the election toward Bush. Often, it's the messenger that makes the material.''
 Although Ferrell portrayed Bush as bumbling and not too bright, the impersonation was strangely affectionate, and Bush reportedly loved it. He asked Ferrell to make an appearance with him at the White House Press Corps dinner in 2000, which Ferrell declined. Bush later made a similar request for a charity event held by Barbara Bush. When Ferrell said no a second time, Bush phoned Jeff Zucker, then the head of NBC, and asked him to persuade Ferrell to perform. ''He said, 'You gotta get your guy to do my mom's charity,' '' Ferrell recalled, using his Bush accent, over dinner at Kelly and Ping's, a restaurant in downtown Manhattan. ''The idea was that Dana Carvey would imitate the dad and I would be the son. And then the two real people would come up behind us, and we'd go, 'Oops, sorry!' That was the whole thing. So George the son called Zucker and I was ... busy. In both cases, I especially did not want to do the inevitable photo op afterwards where we are all holding hands. That would have been a gesture of support.'' Ferrell paused. ''I've actually had people say to me, 'Thanks a lot for Bush,' as if I helped him win the election. Luckily, no one has said that in a while. But I can't help the fact that people in America seem to not mind stupidity.''
 Ferrell's Bush, vapid and likable, was a typical creation. With nearly all the characters he has played -- Ron Burgundy (a vapid, likable news anchor), Frank the Tank (the vapid, likable would-be frat guy in ''Old School'') -- Ferrell shows little interest in searching out a dark side. His niceness and his affection for the lameness of these men redeems their many failings and always makes them somehow attractive. Which is not to say there isn't a subversive element at times. In ''Talladega Nights,'' which he wrote with McKay, Ferrell plays a Nascar driver named Ricky Bobby, a version of his Bush character, and he uses the character's likability to soften what would otherwise be pointed satire. In the film, Ricky Bobby is challenged by Jean Girard, a gay French Formula One driver played by Sacha Baron Cohen. Girard reads ''The Stranger,'' by Albert Camus, and drinks espresso while he drives, and when he trounces Ricky Bobby on the track, Ricky Bobby begins to unravel. At the end of the movie, a rejuvenated Ricky Bobby wins the big race, and he and Girard have a long kiss to celebrate. ''The kiss goes on and on,'' Ferrell said, as his stir-fry chicken and vegetables arrived. ''Adam and I just thought it was funny.'' Ferrell took a bite. ''It still makes me laugh that at press junkets for the movie, the reporters all say, 'Let's talk about that on-screen kiss!' I play along and say we rehearsed for three months. But really I feel like saying, 'What's the big deal?' '' He smiled. ''I do go in and out of Bush sometimes when I'm playing Ricky Bobby,'' he continued. ''I love the idea of Bush having the big kiss with the French guy.''
 In light of the fact that ''Talladega Nights'' has been a huge hit in many of the states whose voters helped elect Bush and opposed gay marriage, it's not hard to wonder if Ferrell's likability might have some effect on the political landscape. Surely it is not a coincidence, Ferrell speculated, that Bush himself read ''The Stranger'' over the summer. ''Bush must be taking his signals from cinema,'' Ferrell told me a month after ''Talladega'' came out. ''But don't you think he's getting on Air Force One and saying to the press corps that travels with him, 'Well, I gotta get back to my Kah-moo'? And then he's nodding off to sleep. 'This is good stuff,' he'll say, and meanwhile the book is dogeared at the same Page 23.''
 Not that Ferrell seriously sees himself as having a real impact. He shrugs off praise and criticism alike. ''Will does not have an ounce of alpha,'' Lorne Michaels says. ''He's so normal that you can forget how talented he is. It's rare for a comedian to be so well adjusted. His height helps. In a Ben Stiller world, he's unusually tall and big. As a result, Will doesn't have that need to dominate.''
 Ferrell grew up as a typical suburban kid. His father, Lee, played keyboards for the Righteous Brothers, and his mother, Kay, was a graduate student in English (she now teaches at a community college). When Ferrell was 8, his parent divorced. He recalls cheering up his younger brother: ''I was the kid who said, 'Look at it this way: we'll have two Christmases now.' ''
 The divorce may be the only cloud in Ferrell's past. He is close to both of his parents. ''Will was always funny,'' his father told me. ''But he was never one of those kids who are always 'on.' It was not like every Thursday night was show night. But in high school, if they wanted to sell T-shirts for whatever fund-raising drive they had, they'd ask Will to make the announcement. He'd get on the school's P.A., make everyone laugh and they'd sell everything.''
 After years of witnessing the instability of his father's career, Ferrell initially shied away from show business. At U.S.C., he studied to be a sports broadcaster. After graduation, he moved back home with his mother for three years. (''I had no ego about that,'' he says now. ''It's kind of sad.'') He took an internship at a local cable access news show in Orange County, and one day he cracked a joke on the air, and it prompted a life-changing epiphany. ''I realized I didn't want to be Jim Lampley,'' he says. ''I wanted to be Chevy Chase.''
 Ferrell had many disastrous day jobs (playing an elf at a shopping mall, failing miserably as a bank teller, losing the keys to the cars he was paid to valet park), while at night he studied acting and performed his stand-up routine. He met his future wife, Viveca, in the summer of 1991 at a theater class at the South Coast Repertory Conservatory. ''She was in the good group and I was in the worse group,'' he said, as he finished his meal at Kelly and Ping's. ''But the good group just needed guys, and I was tall.'' Viveca, who is Swedish, did not pursue acting; she became a fine-arts auctioneer. They are now about to have a second son, and they live in the Hollywood Hills with three dogs.
 In 1991, Ferrell began taking classes at the Groundlings, an improv company that is Los Angeles's answer to Chicago's Second City. He quickly graduated from taking classes to joining the main company. Like Second City in Chicago, the Groundlings, where future ''S.N.L.'' stars like Phil Hartman, Jon Lovitz and Maya Rudolph all studied and performed, is a pipeline to ''S.N.L.'' From the start, Ferrell's persona was the large but otherwise remarkably average-seeming guy who could go really crazy. ''I remember seeing Will at an alternative comedy club in L.A.,'' Apatow says. ''He was wearing a full-body unitard with a hood, and he was imitating a bad magic act in the style of Cirque du Soleil. I was always trying to find out the root of his humor, the great mystery of Will. But after much investigation, I have learned that there is no great story that explains why Will is so funny. Will Ferrell may be the greatest explanation for genes: he was just born funny.''
 ''Saturday Night Live'' called in 1995 and asked Ferrell to audition. He was very nervous. ''It was harder, and a bigger break,'' he told me, ''to get on 'S.N.L.' than it was to get into movies.'' Ferrell was competing with about 36 people, only 8 of whom were hired. He chose three bits for his audition: Senator Ted Kennedy doing stand-up (''God, this is dated, I thought''); the Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray at a play reading; and an angry parent yelling at his kids to get off the shed.
 He passed the first audition and was asked to meet with Lorne Michaels at his office. ''I had this idea that I would bring an attache case full of fake money to his office,'' Ferrell recalled. ''I'd say, 'We can talk all day long, but what really talks is money.' And then I was going to leave.'' But when Ferrell walked in with the briefcase, he found it too awkward to take out the cash. So he sat with the briefcase at his side. At his next meeting with Michaels, Ferrell brought the money and the briefcase again. ''He told me I was hired and to put the briefcase down,'' Ferrell said. ''I ended up giving around $10,000 to his assistant in fake money.''
 In his first show, Ferrell performed a sketch as the ''get off the shed'' guy -- the first in a long series of Ferrell's even-tempered men who violently erupt and yet somehow remain affable. ''It was goofy and light,'' Michaels recalled. ''Will was part of the new breed of comedians who grew up watching 'S.N.L.' For them, comedy is a legitimate career choice. When I got into it 40 years ago, this was a disreputable profession. It was uncharted, and your parents did not approve. Comedy was an act of rebellion. Now that anger has pretty much evaporated. Parents are proud if their kid is funny. And that creates a different kind of comedy.''
 Michaels was quick to point out how versatile Ferrell was on ''S.N.L.'' -- playing everything from a male cheerleader to the ''Jeopardy!'' host Alex Trebek to Janet Reno, the U.S. attorney general at the time. In his first season on 
 ''S.N.L.,'' Ferrell got bad reviews in the press. ''I put one review up on my door,'' Ferrell told me as he finished his ice cream. ''I remember calling my mom and saying, 'Well, I'm the only cast member that was mentioned by name in this review, but they called me most obnoxious newcomer.' '' Ferrell laughed. ''I thought: They noticed me! I'm off to a flying start.''
 It was a cool September night in Los Angeles, and Ferrell was tucked into a corner of Orso, an Italian restaurant. He was wearing a pair of loose khaki slacks and yet another T-shirt. (''I hang my T-shirts,'' he said earlier, ''I like to give them equal wear.'') Ferrell had been busy: he'd finished the shooting for a film, ''Blades of Glory,'' in which he plays a sex-addicted figure skater competing in the Olympics. The day after the shoot was finished, Ferrell flew to Canada for the premiere of his new film, ''Stranger Than Fiction,'' at the Toronto Film Festival. In ''Stranger Than Fiction,'' Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an I.R.S. auditor who wakes up one day to hear a woman, played by Emma Thompson, narrating his life story. When she mentions his imminent death, Crick embarks on a quest to find her and save himself.
 While ''Stranger Than Fiction'' is humorous in parts, it also delves into larger existential questions about art and life, comedy and tragedy. ''I was crying during the entire movie,'' Ferrell said when he returned from the movie's premiere in Toronto. ''It was almost like when you're crying so hard that you can't catch your breath. It was like we won the game 48 to nothing, and no one thought we were going to win.''
 Ferrell rarely talks about his films this way, but ''Stranger Than Fiction'' is a departure for him. There's nothing goofy about his character: he's orderly and trapped. ''It was so freeing to not run around and act like a crazy person,'' Ferrell said. ''It was so nice to be conversational and talk like a normal human being. I felt like my job on 'Stranger Than Fiction' was to play really good defense. Don't throw the ball out of bounds. If you're open, take the shot, but otherwise don't get too fancy.''
 At the premiere, he was asked whether ''Stranger Than Fiction'' was an indication that he was going to stop making his trademark comedies. (''No.'') He was also asked a question that he is asked repeatedly about his film career: What's with all the nudity? Though Ferrell does not appear in his underwear in ''Stranger Than Fiction,'' in ''Talladega Nights,'' for instance, he runs around a racetrack in his underwear twice. ''The journalists would ask me, 'Is it in your contract that you have to be naked or in your underwear for every movie?' '' Ferrell said, looking frustrated -- which is as close as he gets to looking angry. ''Sometimes I say that Unicef gets a percentage of the box office if I'm naked.''
 Ferrell has been taking his clothes off since ''Saturday Night Live.'' In one sketch on the show, he rolled up a pair of star-spangled short shorts until they fit him like a thong. While filming a nude running scene in ''Old School,'' he refused to wear a robe between takes. Even in ''Bewitched,'' perhaps the most conventional comedy Ferrell has done, his character appears naked.
 None of the nude scenes would be funny, of course, if Ferrell were in tiptop shape. ''Skinny is not funny,'' Ferrell said. ''When I take my clothes off, it's not to show off. It wouldn't be funny if I was ripped.'' He paused. ''But now I'm going to pull back on all the nudity. I don't want to be predictable. The last thing I want to do is think of myself in the third person. Like, this is a Will Ferrell part. Or that's a Will Ferrell joke. I think that means you won't see me in my underwear again for at least two years.''
 Ferrell's use of nudity can be a revealing aspect of his comedic perspective. It is always extreme: he isn't ever just standing around in his underwear; he's running or twisting or sitting with his feet up on a desk. It's funny in large part because he adds an element of discomfort. ''I like to find the funny thing and then, because you're already here, go one step beyond it to there,'' Ferrell said. ''The best way I can describe it is, when I was at 'S.N.L.' and a sketch was bombing, human nature would be flop sweat and get off the stage. But I would actually slow down and take more time because I had this perverse thing of, 'O.K., you don't like it, I'm going to make you sit through it even longer.' '' Ferrell looked pleased. ''There's a satisfaction in pushing something as far as it will go and seeing if you can convince an audience. I have ideas like that all the time, things that just strike me as funny. Adam and I talk about me doing an album of terrible songs that we've written and singing them really earnestly.'' He paused, then smiled. ''I could do a tour. Maybe sing a song or two in my underwear.'' It was hard to tell if he was joking.
 At 4 p.m. on a Saturday in late October, 10 hours after arriving from England, where he had attended the well-received premiere of ''Stranger Than Fiction,'' Ferrell was in a tiny dressing room on the eighth floor at 30 Rockefeller Center, where ''Saturday Night Live'' is filmed. His father, Lee, was sitting on a dilapidated sunken couch, and his nearly constant traveling companions, his assistant, Jessica Elbaum, and his publicist, Matthew Labov, were sitting in tall director's chairs. Ferrell, who was wearing the pants half of a track suit and a long-sleeved T-shirt, looked a little tired. He was there to support John C. Reilly, his co-star in ''Talladega Nights.'' Reilly was the host of ''S.N.L.'' that evening, and Ferrell, a close friend, had volunteered to make a cameo appearance. The idea was that Ferrell would interrupt Reilly's opening monologue -- but in character, playing James Lipton, the host of ''Inside the Actor's Studio.'' Ferrell's Lipton, insufferably obsequious, a blowhard extraordinaire, was one of the impersonations that he made famous during his tenure at ''S.N.L..''
 Ferrell looped a long muffler that he bought at a London soccer game around his neck. He walked down the hall to the stage and took a seat in the audience in the second row on the aisle. Reilly, who was wearing a brown suit, came onstage to applause from a small audience that had gathered for a rehearsal.
 ''When I was asked to host 'Saturday Night Live,' I said yes, of course,'' Reilly began. ''But I told them, a lot of people know my face, but they don't know my name.'' At that moment, Ferrell rose to his feet and said, in his most pompous baritone: ''That is a patent falsehood! You, sir, are a delight!'' Reilly then invited Ferrell's Lipton onstage, and Ferrell proceeded to take out a large stack of blue note cards. Listing all of Reilly's film credits, Lipton-style -- only getting them entirely wrong -- Ferrell said, ''You were brilliant as Roxie Hart in 'Chicago.' '' ''No,'' Reilly countered. ''That character was played by Renee Zellweger.'' Ferrell persisted and demanded to hear some of Roxie's big number from ''Chicago.'' Reilly relented, and the ''S.N.L.'' house band played the song ''Nowadays,'' as he and Ferrell both began to sing. Ferrell sang in character as Lipton -- a little too much vibrato, a little too grandiose.
 After the sketch, Reilly and Ferrell took a moment to revise some of the stage direction, and then Ferrell went to change into a gray suit and be made up to resemble Lipton for the dress rehearsal. Later, seconds before the 8 p.m. start time for the dress rehearsal, Ferrell was taken to his chair in the second row. When he stood up in character as Lipton, there was a moment of surprise in the audience that quickly gave way to recognition, followed by cries of ''It's Will Ferrell!'' After the applause died down, Ferrell went onstage and did the bit.
 Afterward, Ferrell wasn't completely pleased with the performance. He said he felt the sketch was a little flat, a bit tame. He conferred with Reilly and studied his script. For the actual on-air show at 11:30 p.m., Ferrell added some physical comedy. When he mentioned Roxie Hart and ''Chicago,'' Ferrell asked to speak to Roxie. At that moment, he put his fingers to Reilly's lips. ''Can I talk to Roxie?'' he begged. ''Is she in there?'' Ferrell tried to pry Reilly's teeth apart, pulling his mouth open. It was invasive, unexpected and very funny.
 ''Baby steps,'' Ferrell said later, when he returned to the dressing room. ''You can always make something better, but it's always baby steps, little by little.'' He sat down in a director's chair. He looked weary. But there was little time to rest. He and McKay were about to start writing their next script, ''Step-Brothers,'' which will star Ferrell and Reilly. By February, Ferrell plans to have grown his curly hair into an Afro so he'll be ready to play a '70s basketball star in a movie about the American Basketball Association. ''When I left 'Saturday Night Live,' I was off work for three months,'' Ferrell said. ''That was the longest I haven't worked in years.'' He paused. ''I do feel, at heart, that I'm a lazy person who found this thing that I love. Comedy makes me industrious. Without it, I'm just another guy.''

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
SOCIAL conservatives had a bad election night on Tuesday. A slew of pro-life senators and House members lost their races. Missouri voted to amend its Constitution to protect a right to clone human embryos for research. Every pro-life initiative on a state ballot failed. 
 But before we declare this election proof that social conservatism is doomed, consider that Republicans as a whole had a worse night. Pro-lifers lost four seats in the Senate and, depending on some unresolved races, appear to have lost 20 in the House. But the Republican Party lost six in the Senate and 29 in the House. The discrepancy stems from the fact that some pro-choice Democrats are replacing pro-choice Republicans, and even a few pro-life Democrats are replacing pro-life Republicans. 
Meanwhile, ballot initiatives as a whole went better for the social right than for other conservative factions. Almost all of the initiatives against same-sex marriage won. Even most Western states, where the Republicans' social conservatism is said to be dooming the party, voted for those initiatives -- which typically ran well ahead of local party candidates. Colorado and Nevada rejected legal marijuana. Economic conservatives, on the other hand, lost every fight over the minimum wage.
 That's something to remember the next time you hear that after their defeat, the Republicans need to ''move to the center.'' Maybe they should: but which center? When editorialists talk about the ''sensible center,'' they usually have in mind free-trading, budget-balancing social liberals. It is a political profile often found in the business world, and on the coasts. But there is another center -- one that's liberal on economic measures but conservative on social mores.
 In several high-profile races, the winning candidates played to this ''center.'' For example, Senator-elect Claire McCaskill pounded the Republican incumbent, Jim Talent, in Missouri on economic issues like veterans' benefits, but she came out against partial-birth abortion weeks before the election. Representative Harold Ford, a Democrat who nearly pulled off an upset in the Tennessee Senate race, went so far as to endorse a constitutional amendment on marriage and to call himself pro-life. 
 Senator-elect Robert Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, vowed to fight free trade, but also to oppose abortion. If we take Mr. Casey at his word about his intentions in the Senate, then his defeat of Rick Santorum is simply a move to a less abrasive style of social conservatism, not a repudiation of it.
 Something similar happened in the last presidential campaign. President Bush was on the defensive when he talked about outsourcing jobs and the cost of health care, while John Kerry was on the defensive on most of the social issues -- and Mr. Kerry eventually said his position on marriage was basically the same as the president's. 
 The real message of the last few elections is that, for the most part, social issues help the Republicans and economic ones the Democrats. Did talking about energy policy, and keeping quiet about gay marriage, help Senator George Allen of Virginia survive Jim Webb's challenge?
 The lesson for the Democrats, meanwhile, is not that they all need to move right on social issues. It is that they can be a lasting majority if they are an economically liberal party with socially conservative and socially liberal wings. Because if they choose to be a socially liberal party with economically liberal and economically conservative wings, they will soon find themselves back in minority status.
 The Republicans, meanwhile, can prosper if they can find ways to address the economic concerns of working-class cultural conservatives -- many of them unmoved by free-market bromides -- without doing violence to their own limited-government principles. 
 I agree with the economic conservatives on most issues, and disagree with the social conservatives on some, so I'm not entirely happy about the electoral reality I'm describing. (I wish Colorado and Nevada had voted the other way on marijuana, for instance.) But there it is nonetheless. While both social conservatives and Republicans need to make some changes, a divorce isn't on the table, and there's no political reason one should be.

HEADLINE: For Incoming Democrats, Populism Trumps Ideology

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and KATE ZERNIKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 

 BODY:
The newly elected Democratic class of 2006, which is set to descend on the Capitol next week, will hardly be the first freshmen to arrive in Washington promising to make a difference. 
 The last time Congress changed hands, the Republican freshman class of 1994 roared into town under the leadership of Newt Gingrich as speaker and quickly advanced a conservative agenda of exceptional ambition.
Many in the class of 2006, especially those who delivered the new Democratic majorities by winning Republican seats, show little appetite for that kind of ideological crusade. But in interviews with nearly half of them this week, the freshmen -- 41 in the House and 9 in the Senate, including one independent -- conveyed a keen sense of their own moment in history, and a distinct world view: they say they were given a rare opportunity by voters, many of them independents and Republicans, who were tired of the partisanship and gridlock in Washington.
 Now, they say, they have to produce -- to deal with long-festering problems like access to affordable health care and the loss of manufacturing jobs, and to find a bipartisan consensus for an exit strategy in Iraq, a source of continuing division not only between but also within the parties. 
 Many of them say they must also, somehow, find a way to address the growing anxiety among voters about a global economy that no longer seems to work for them. There is a strong populist tinge to this class.
 In general, they set themselves an extraordinary (political veterans might say impossible) task: to avoid the ideological wars that have so dominated Congress in recent years, to be pragmatists, and to change the tone in Washington after a sharply partisan campaign. 
 ''I see myself, hopefully, as a bridge builder, a consensus person,'' said Harry Mitchell, 66, a longtime state senator and former mayor of Tempe, Ariz., who defeated Representative J. D. Hayworth, an emblematic member of the class of 1994. ''I can't be a rabid partisan Democrat and represent this district.'' 
 Nancy Boyda, who defeated Representative Jim Ryun, the legendary track star, in a district in Kansas that President Bush carried by 20 percentage points in 2004, summarized her mandate this way: ''Stop the gridlock, stop the nastiness, get something done. People are tired of excuses.''
 Claire McCaskill, who defeated Senator Jim Talent of Missouri in a fiercely competitive race, said: ''I'm not from a blue echo chamber. I'm from a state that's really like America -- it's divided.'' 
 ''The problem with Washington,'' Ms. McCaskill added, ''is you have so many senators who are from bright blue and bright red states; they're not interested in common ground. They're interested in making each other look bad.''
 These attitudes could lead to tensions with the party's liberal base in Congress -- many of the party's expected committee chairmen are traditional liberals -- and thus occasional headaches over the next two years for the Democratic leaders, Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Harry Reid. 
 But Democratic strategists say both leaders recognize that the new Democratic majority was elected, in large part, from Republican-leaning districts and states. If those new members vote in a purely partisan way, they -- and the majority -- will quickly be put at risk.
 Representative Rahm Emanuel, the Illinois Democrat who recruited many of these candidates as head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, described the group as ''moderate in temperament and reformers in spirit.'' Conservatives tend to highlight the conservatism in the new class as a sign that Democrats are essentially ceding ground to the right on issues like gun control and abortion.
 But many of these freshmen Democrats are hard to pigeonhole ideologically. Even among the most socially conservative, there is a strong streak of economic populism that is a unifying force. 
 Heath Shuler, for example, the former professional football player and newly elected House Democrat from North Carolina, is anti-abortion and pro-gun, but sounds like an old-style Democrat on economic issues.
 ''I was taught at a very, very young age about faith and personal responsibility, and through that, that responsibility was about helping those who cannot help themselves,'' Mr. Shuler said. ''If you look at what the Democratic Party stands for, it is about helping others who can't help themselves.''
 Like other Democrats, he supports legislation to increase the minimum wage and make college tuition tax deductible. He also opposes trade agreements that he says have led to a 78 percent loss in textile industry jobs in his state.
 Similarly, Ms. Boyda of Kansas, a first-time office holder who relied on lengthy newspaper inserts to make her case to the voters, said, ''The rural economy has been left out.'' She added: ''A lot of my district feels a great deal of insecurity about their jobs, their health care, their business, their family farm. They feel like they're just kind of hanging out there.''
 Carol Shea-Porter, a social worker and new House member from New Hampshire who considers herself a populist, said, ''The theme of my campaign was, I'm running for the rest of us.'' She added that no matter how much the Bush administration boasted of job growth, her voters ''understood those were Wal-Mart jobs.'' And, she said, ''They understood when they talked about the stock market boom, that half of Americans aren't even in the stock market.''
 Jim Webb, who defeated Senator George Allen of Virginia, campaigned heavily on the idea that the middle class was increasingly at risk in an age of growing inequality. Bob Casey, who overwhelmingly defeated Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, said he looked forward to ''a really intensive focus on health care that I hope to be a part of.''
 That economic populism extends, for many candidates, to a new emphasis on expanding health coverage. Congressional Democrats who lived through the Clinton administration's failed effort to create a national health insurance plan, which many believe was a crucial factor in the Democrats' losses in 1994, have been wary of broad health legislation for years. (And being in the minority, they were unable to do much about it, regardless.) But the class of '06 is adamant that something major can, and will, be done.
 Dave Loebsack, a political science professor in Iowa who unseated the veteran Republican moderate, Representative Jim Leach, said he intended to sign on to proposed legislation to create a single-payer, national health insurance program ''as one of the first things I will do when I get to Congress.''
 ''I have no idea where it's going to go next year,'' Mr. Loebsack said, ''but at least we can give it a fair hearing.''
 Steven Kagen, an allergist who won a Wisconsin district that has been represented by a Republican for much of the past 30 years, campaigned on a ''No Patient Left Behind'' plan. Mr. Kagen won despite doubters who called it ''the Hillary hot potato,'' a reference to the first lady turned New York senator who was the architect of the Clinton plan.
 ''This issue has blurred the lines between the two parties,'' Mr. Kagen said. ''You don't have to be a Republican or a Democrat to be ill, and to understand that the health care system doesn't work.''
 Mr. Kagen is one of several new House members urging a renewed commitment to the more than eight million uninsured children in the United States, an issue that will move to the forefront when the State Children's Health Insurance Program comes up for renewal next year.
 Most of these new Democrats said they were also committed to changes in the new Medicare prescription drug program; in fact, giving the government the power to negotiate prices with drug companies is one of the first items of business in the Democrats' ''Six for '06 Agenda.'' The agenda also includes an increase in the minimum wage and expansion of embryonic stem cell research.
 Ron Klein, a state senator who defeated the veteran Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Florida, said he had often heard both from retirees who fell into the gaps of the new Medicare drug plan and from ''taxpayers who were really put off that this was something that could have been done a lot better.''
 Democrats, of course, had their chance to resolve the prescription drug problem in the past -- their party held the Senate for a brief period in 2001-02 -- and few issues have been more divisive on Capitol Hill.
 But the new Democrats say they have high hopes of building bipartisan coalitions for these changes in Medicare, for expanding embryonic stem cell research, and for other parts of their agenda. ''I'm still scratching my head'' over Mr. Bush's veto of last year's stem cell bill, said Ed Perlmutter, a former state senator who won a House district in the Denver suburbs.
 Representative Sherrod Brown, who is moving to the Senate from the House after beating Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio, argued: ''Tell me a whole lot of Republicans won't work with us on finding a way for middle-class kids to get a college education, to vote for embryonic stem cell research, to raise the minimum wage. John McCain is already out there talking about prescription drug issues.''
 The flip side to this, Democratic strategists say, is that Republicans could peel off a critical mass of conservative Democrats on certain issues. Some veterans on Capitol Hill remember the Democratic Congress of the early Reagan years, when conservative Democrats regularly broke ranks on tax cuts. 
 The true challenge to any new climate of bipartisanship will most likely come over Iraq. Many of the freshmen said they looked to the bipartisan Iraq Study Group -- led by James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state, and former Representative Lee H. Hamilton -- as an invaluable vehicle for consensus building. 
 ''I pray, and I mean that literally, that their recommendation can be seen as a way forward,'' Ms. Boyda said.
 They also said they were pleased that Mr. Bush announced, the day after the election, that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld would be replaced. Gabrielle Giffords, newly elected to a House seat in Arizona, said she had rarely given a speech without calling for Mr. Rumsfeld's removal. 
 But there are still divisions in the Democratic caucus over an exit strategy for Iraq, although many of the freshmen come to Washington with a keen sense of the voters' desire for change. Joe Sestak, a former Navy vice admiral who won a House seat in Pennsylvania, said: ''I honestly believe this nation in its vote has said: 'What are we doing in Iraq? We can't stay there.' I think they are rightfully leading the leaders to say, 'Set a date; move toward it.' ''
 Others stop short of suggesting a fixed timetable. As they headed to Washington for their orientation, many of the incoming freshmen still spoke like outsiders. Tim Walz, a Minnesota teacher, retired National Guardsman and newly elected House Democrat, described himself as ''a farm state Democrat-soldier who's concerned about the environment and civil liberties.'' 
 He has seen how ugly the partisanship can get in American politics, Mr. Walz said, and is adamant about changing it. ''I'm convinced that what we need to do is heal,'' he said. ''Tuesday was not a Democratic referendum; it was an American referendum. It's not that the American people are so enamored with the Democratic vision, but what they believed is what we said about cleaning up corruption, having some real open debate. It just seems so broken.''

HEADLINE: Spitzer Buries His Cares For Weekend On the Sand

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., Nov. 11 

 BODY:
Famous for his intensity, even his ferocity, Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general-turned-governor-elect of New York, is trying out a new persona: beach bum. 
 At a press briefing Saturday morning, Mr. Spitzer confessed to having taken a two-hour nap on the beach at a resort here on Friday and stated his intention of returning to the ocean in the afternoon.
 As for the ''enormous pile of memos on the budget'' that he said he had brought with him, Mr. Spitzer said he planned ''to bury them in the sand and read a B-level novel.''
 But no one would mistake Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat who won Tuesday's election by a landslide, for Jimmy Buffett.
 As is his wont, Mr. Spitzer arrived at 9 a.m. on the dot for a breakfast meeting with Anibal Acevedo Vila, the governor of Puerto Rico, at La Fortaleza, the governor's residence. And though he did not wear a tie, his shirt was a decidedly nontropical blue check, under a navy blazer.
 While the two men chatted about their days at law school and the spectacular views from the governor's windows, Mr. Spitzer said, they also discussed economic development and the implications of last week's Democratic sweep in Washington.
 Mr. Spitzer's wife, Silda Wall Spitzer, and Luisa Gandara, the first lady of Puerto Rico, also attended.
 Mr. Spitzer tackled some major issues at a brief news conference afterward. He referred to the war in Iraq as ''an unfortunate quagmire,'' but said he had supported eliminating Saddam Hussein's threat to the international community.
 He pledged to appoint Latinos to important posts in his administration but sidestepped a question about Puerto Rico's status. There is a longstanding debate in Puerto Rico, now a commonwealth, about seeking independence or statehood.
 Asked about his inauguration, Mr. Spitzer he said he was not sure if he would seek private donations to pay for a celebration, as Gov. George E. Pataki did for his first swearing-in, in 1995. That practice has raised ethical questions in the past, Mr. Spitzer said, ''and we're going to handle it in a very, very different way.''
 After the press conference, Mr. Spitzer acknowledged that his campaign for governor had not been as emotionally draining as it might have been. Polls had him far in the lead from the beginning, and he won by a 40-point margin on Tuesday.
 Still, candidates can never really relax, he added, because problems can crop up unexpectedly.
 ''Look at Alan,'' he said, referring to Alan G. Hevesi, the state comptroller, who is under criminal investigation for his use of a government employee to chauffeur his wife. Mr. Hevesi was re-elected, but Mr. Spitzer may have to decide whether to try to remove him from office if the issue is not resolved by Jan. 1.
 Before returning to New York, Mr. Spitzer appeared Saturday evening at a conference of the New York State Assembly Puerto Rican/Hispanic Task Force. In brief remarks that were mostly an opportunity for cheering and photographs, he thanked many people, saying, ''The work is ahead of us.''

HEADLINE: Epicenter

BYLINE: By William Safire. 
Send comments and suggestions to: safireonlanguage@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
Before we getto today's main wordwork, let us set memories of ''the late unpleasantness'' surrounding Election Day 2006 behind us and take note of the first bright new coinage of the uplifting political campaign of 2008.
In the hush-hush Washington Whispers column of U.S. News & World Report, Paul Bedard reports that Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts ''is inviting conservatives -- and especially Christian conservatives -- to Beantown for cultivational meetings and briefings on his 2008 Republican presidential campaign. . . . If you think the Christian right would have a problem with a Mormon, you would be wrong. We hear he's wowing them.'' 
 The verb cultivate began with the Latin colere, ''to till the soil'' and was extended in English to mean ''to nurture, foster the growth of'' and more recently ''to make friends with, to get close to.'' It is what politicians do before moving to the next stages, to persuade and then to enlist.
 For centuries, the language has been limping along with the adjectives cultivable, cultivatable and cultive, not one of which caught on. But thanks to the coinage contributed without specific attribution to the nascent Romney campaign, we now have an adjective that evokes instant understanding. Minted in Massachusetts, the very epicenter of liberalism, the new word is described by a Romney spokesman, Eric Fehrnstrom, as one that ''sounds like a combination of cultivate and inspirational.'' Let the 2008 campaign begin.
 As the relentless Nitpicker's League will note, I misused the word epicenter in the preceding sentence. About a month ago, in a column about the expression ''skin in the game,'' I got carried away with the ''epicenter of this epidermic epic.'' Sure enough, one Alan Zarky in e-mailville wrote: ''I was surprised to see you use epicenter in the sense of 'very center.' The epi means 'upon,' and the word has a specific meaning in geology, 'the point on the earth's surface above the center of an earthquake.' Shouldn't we leave the word to its derivationally appropriate meaning?''
 I knew I was stretching it (and sneakily began the next paragraph with ''below that sense'') because I had been sternly corrected by a thick stratum of geologists years ago for confusing epicenter (''the breakout point on the surface above an earthquake's underground hypocenter'') with ground zero (''the point on the surface directly below an aboveground nuclear explosion'').
 The question is: in determining the correctness of meaning, do we stick to the seismologists' rigor, or do we go all loosey-goosey with the figurative extension? 
 ''Its metaphoric use is correct as long as it refers to a specific location,'' opines Mark Zoback, professor of geophysics at Stanford. ''I don't think it works with respect to ideas.'' Joseph Pickett, executive editor of American Heritage dictionaries, says, ''Even though the metaphor may be a misapplication of the scientific understanding of the word, the metaphor effectively evokes the visible focus of radiating power in an earthquake, and seems worth keeping in a writer's bag of tricks.''
 I'd say it is O.K. to use as the ''very center'' of a place. It can even symbolize a place, as in the title of a book, ''Epicenter of Peace,'' by Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan. Harvard's Graham Allison, who wrote the introduction, says it was chosen for its double entendre: Kazakhstan, site of 500 nuclear tests in the Soviet era, eliminated all nuclear warheads left there afterward. EPCenter, pronounced ''epicenter,'' was also the name of the reformer Grigory Yavlinsky's think tank in Moscow that vainly tried to democratize post-Soviet Russia. The title is a conscious paradox, as in ''waging peace,'' juxtaposing a warlike word with its opposite. 
 But let's not go overboard: the Times headline in January ''Living at an Epicenter of Diabetes, Defiance and Despair'' would have better used the word ''nexus,'' ''crossroads'' or ''focal point.'' And the real estate firm Extell, advertising its tall apartment house with ''sunset loggia'' on New York's 42nd Street as ''the epicenter of urban culture,'' is a metaphoric bridge too far. A certain loosey-goosiness is tolerable in colorful speech, but let us remember that the epicenter carries the connotation of a dangerous place to be.

Urchin
 The entertainer Madonna took a lot of flak recently for what the columnist Richard Johnson of The New York Post described as ''her adoption of an African urchin.'' Some readers took issue with the use of that word, taking it to be racist. In a note to me, the columnist disputes that: ''I say it's not derogatory, and certainly not racist. I couldn't use the word 'orphan' because the boy's father is very much alive. What do you say?''
 It's rooted in the Greek word for ''hedgehog,'' a prickly critter, and a spiny ''sea urchin'' is not something you want to step on. Six centuries ago, the noun began to be applied to people, and since 1780, reports the Oxford English Dictionary, ''often applied with commiserative force to children poorly, raggedly or untidily clothed.'' Though mainly used to describe mischievous young boys, through the years it has not discriminated against girls, especially those ''of roguish disposition,'' who, in recent years, have sported ''urchin-cut hair.''
 Today the word, often in the phrase street urchin, has come to mean a somewhat rambunctious child, usually in a run-down neighborhood, often with a dirty face and dressed in soiled clothes, who likes to sass passing grown-ups. The use of urchin by writers continues to have what the O.E.D. aptly described as ''commiserative force,'' in which adult irritation with the child's prickly behavior is ameliorated by sympathy for the kid's economic condition or grudging admiration for what John McCain's mother called a ''scamp.'' The word is neither racist nor sexist.

HEADLINE: Putting Their Heads Together, Then Their Cash

BYLINE: By CHRISTIAN L. WRIGHT

 BODY:
THEY started getting together on Thursday nights for a glass of wine about 10 years ago, after one woman's husband died.
 They were just a group of old friends in Oshkosh, Wis., who saw one another through children's weddings, the births of grandchildren and rounds of cancer treatment.
 ''We'd support each other, as women do, through these joys and challenges,'' said Sue Ebling, 58. 
 Then, on a Thursday in 2002, one woman suggested they start a charitable fund. And their giving circle was born. Each of the 12 women in the Wine Ladies Fund agreed to give $25 twice a year. ''Twenty-five dollars doesn't mean very much,'' said Ms. Ebling, the chairwoman of the circle, ''but when pooled together, it makes a huge impact.''
 It's not just the pooling together. The giving circle's money is managed by the Women's Fund of the Oshkosh Area Community Foundation, which invests a portion. So part of each donation is put to work immediately while the rest grows. 
 In the Wine Ladies' case, the fund grows faster than it would based on $25 gifts: some members contribute large sums, and people outside the group make gifts as well. 
 The nonprofit world calls it leveraging philanthropy. 
 A giving circle is a bit like a book club, a sewing bee or those investment groups for church members who pool resources and buy stock. A giving circle can be big or small and vary in demographics, interests and resources. The Wine Ladies Fund in Oshkosh focuses on adolescent girls in the area. Each member of the circle has a vote on which grants to make. In 2005, the group gave $5,000, earmarked for a girls' nutrition program in the Boys and Girls Club. 
 ''Probably people wouldn't bother to make an individual donation,'' said Ms. Ebling. But in the giving circle, she said, ''There's a camaraderie and a group motivation to do good, especially for those of us in small communities without deep pockets.'' 
 The National Philanthropic Trust says that 89 percent of American households make charitable contributions each year. The gifts may be piecemeal: $25 to save the leatherback turtle and $50 to a college alumni fund, or maybe a larger pledge to be paid over years to fight world hunger or help the environment.
 Giving circles join like-minded people across socioeconomic lines. Some of the circles are informal, with each member writing a check to the chosen charity or cause. Others are more organized, with bank accounts and tax advisers. Fields of interest include children, women, education, economic development, human services, the arts, gay and lesbian issues and natural and historic preservation.
 More formal groups include the Full Circle Fund in San Francisco, which calls itself an engaged philanthropic organization. The fund was started six years ago by Josh Becker. At the time, Mr. Becker was busy with his job at a venture capital firm, but kept thinking about education and housing, the issues that had always been important to him. He wanted to have an impact, and so did a lot of his colleagues. 
 They decided to harness their ''intellectual, financial, social and political capital'' as the group's mission states, to tackle the community's most pressing problems and find solutions.
 The group of 10 has grown to 75. The members, many of whom work in finance or technology, commit both time and money in three areas: housing, technology and education. 
 ''We use all the tools in the toolbox to create social change,'' said Mr. Becker, 37, the fund's chairman. ''We actively look for ways to change policy.''
 Jeff Camp, chairman of the education committee of the fund, said: ''My commitment was $5,000. But the time commitment in some ways is more challenging. Do we do painting days? No, that's not the kind of organization we are.'' 
 Instead, they help with business plans (as they did for the Leadership High School, a small charter school in San Francisco) and act as management consultants (as they did for an expansion at the New Teacher Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz). Since it began in 2000, the Full Circle Fund has raised about $2.5 million and has made about 20 grants.
 The giving circle model is particularly popular among women, said Anne Mosle, president of the eight-year-old Washington Area Women's Foundation, which has generated two such circles. ''Historically, we're the volunteers and have done the bake sales,'' she said. ''We're building a pipeline of women philanthropists to reclaim that power.'' 
 Her foundation has grown 50 percent in the last five years. In 2000, $40,000 went into the community. In 2005, the foundation and the giving circles gave more than $1 million in grants. 
 Barbara Strom Thompson is a co-chairwoman of the Rainmakers Giving Circle, one of two circles that operate under the umbrella of the Washington foundation. The Rainmakers are 20 women, ''from stay-at-home moms to doctors,'' each of whom pledges $5,000 over two years, Ms. Thompson said. ''All of us could give checks on our own,'' she said. ''But together we can be more strategic and more public about it.'' 
 One grant made by the Rainmakers in 2005 was $10,000 to a reading program at the Middle School for Girls in Anacostia, a poor neighborhood in southeast Washington. 
 There is a waiting list for the Rainmakers and the other giving circle that grew from the foundation, the African-American Giving Circle, Ms. Mosle said. In three years, the Washington Area Women's Foundation may have eight more circles up and running, she said. 
 ''There's a buzz in the room when people come together and connect through their sense of community,'' Ms. Mosle said. ''People are looking to be part of something bigger than themselves.''

HEADLINE: Aiding the Schools That Gave Them a Chance

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
NOTHING succeeds like success, as the saying goes, and nowhere is that more evident than at the nation's richest universities and colleges. Even as the coffers at Harvard, Yale and other prestigious institutions overflow, money continues to pour in, especially from their driven Type-A alumni.
 Last March, for example, Columbia University announced a $200 million gift -- its largest single donation -- from Dawn M. Greene and the Jerome L. Greene Foundation. The money will establish a neuroscience center in honor of Mr. Greene, a former lawyer and real estate investor in New York who died in 1999. In August, Philip H. Knight, the founder of Nike, promised $105 million for a new business school campus at Stanford, a university with an endowment of $15 billion.
And Princeton University's alumni have pledged more than $40 million to the school's annual giving campaign this year, a record there. At last count, Princeton's endowment stood at $12.7 billion.
 With so much money going to A-list institutions, how are lesser-known universities competing? Some of them have stayed in the game by tapping into self-made alumni who remember the schools that gave them their chance. 
 Consider Syracuse University's association with Martin J. Whitman, a 1949 graduate who is an unusually successful investor and mutual fund manager in New York. Mr. Whitman, 82, oversees Third Avenue Funds, a family of mutual funds that has beaten the market averages handily over the years. 
 Syracuse University, Mr. Whitman said, was the only school that would accept him as an undergraduate. Although he also attended Princeton at the graduate level, Mr. Whitman has focused much of his giving on Syracuse, providing the money for the Martin J. Whitman School of Management as well as scholarships for minority students who are not athletes. 
 Mr. Whitman declined to say how much he has given to his alma mater over the years, but he explained why he chose Syracuse. ''During the G.I. bulge, it wasn't easy to get in places,'' Mr. Whitman recalled. ''It was the only place that would take me.'' The son of a women's milliner, he grew up in the Bronx, one of three children in a lower-middle-class family, he said.
 His decision to pay for a business school arose out of Mr. Whitman's belief that most universities' finance programs have little to do with the real world. ''They don't have a clue about 90 percent of what goes on in the financial community,'' he said.
 Tom Walsh, senior vice president for institutional advancement at Syracuse University, said that university officials understood that Mr. Whitman was a teacher at heart and appealed to him that way. ''We began by putting him in the classroom,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''Not too long after that, Marty did a skillful analysis of what needed to happen to increase the quality of the a school.'' The result, Mr. Walsh said, was a jump in Syracuse's ranking among the nation's universities. 
 Baruch College, one of the 11 senior colleges of the City University of New York, has also had success attracting money from grateful alumni, a process that was begun in earnest during the late 1990s after state financing for the institution began to decline. Bernard M. Baruch, the Depression-era financier and presidential adviser, endowed Baruch College with $9 million in 1953. But by 1998, the college's endowment had barely budged. 
 Now, however, the endowment stands at $100 million, thanks to a throng of alumni who appreciate the education they received at Baruch. Their appreciation rises, some have told college officials, as they write tuition checks for their children to attend Ivy League colleges. 
 ''Most of the donors are not shy about saying that they may have gone on to law degrees at Harvard and other degrees at Columbia, but they give back to Baruch because without Baruch they would not have gone on at all,'' said Kathleen M. Waldron, Baruch's president. ''These are primarily men and some women who came from the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn, who took the subway to college who could only go to Baruch because it was free.'' 
 One major donor is Lawrence Zicklin, a former chairman of Neuberger Berman, the money management firm that is a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers. A Baruch graduate who wanted to give back to the institution that gave him his start, Mr. Zicklin donated $18 million in 1998 to build the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch. His and other alumni donations go to supplement professors' salaries so that the institution can compete with richer universities. 
 ''I had put aside money all the years I was working because I knew I wanted to make a gift to an educational institution,'' Mr. Zicklin said. ''I was indebted to City University. No Baruch, no Zicklin, I always say. Everything became possible because of Baruch.'' 
 Like many Baruch students, Mr. Zicklin, 70, came from a family of modest means. He grew up in Brooklyn, where his father, an immigrant from Eastern Europe, owned a candy store. He went to public schools, then Baruch and on to receive his master's in business administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. 
 But he never forgot his undergraduate experience. ''You learn how to be hungry at Baruch,'' he said. ''You learn how to scratch.''
 The University of Massachusetts has also benefited from the achievements of its striving alumni. Like Baruch, it has coped with decreasing state financing, which recently accounted for just 26 percent of the university's operating budget. 
 Eugene M. Isenberg, chief executive of Nabors Industries, an oil services business, has given approximately $9 million to the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, the school that he said helped him overcome a hardscrabble youth. 
 Mr. Isenberg, 76, the son of an immigrant father, grew up in Chelsea, Mass., a town that filed for bankruptcy after the Depression. His family was lower-middle class, but his father dissuaded him from joining the Navy right after high school and pushed him toward college instead. At the last minute, Mr. Isenberg applied to UMass to learn a trade, he said.
 Although Mr. Isenberg went on to earn a master's degree in economics from Princeton, he decided against donating money there. ''I thought, Where could a buck go the farthest, where can you get the best productivity out of a contribution?'' he said. ''Princeton didn't need it. I concluded UMass Amherst was the place.'' 
 He and his wife, Ronnie have established the Isenberg School of Management at UMass and endowed three professorships there -- one in integrative studies at the business school, another in environmental science and a third in engineering. The couple continue to provide the university with $70,000 in scholarship money every year. 
 ''There are people out there who remember their roots and recognize the value of education in their own careers,'' Mr. Isenberg said. ''Education is key to the kingdom in America. I would like to give other people the opportunity I've had.''

HEADLINE: Vintage Fashions Lure Shoppers and Charities Alike

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAITER

 BODY:
JENNIFER SCHNEIDER, a lawyer in Washington, flies to Seattle each November to celebrate her birthday with a shopping spree. She and her sister stake out turf on the sidewalk at 5 a.m. and rev up on coffee and doughnuts as they strategize, making sure their cellphones work so they can alert each other to bargains once they are in the store.
 But they are not waiting for first dibs on designer creations; they are there for the clothing at the Seattle Goodwill Thrift Shop's one-day Glitter Sale. 
 The Schneider sisters dress in leotards, even if it means shivering in the rain, as it did last year, so that they can try on clothes without having to go to a dressing room. ''Once we get inside, we know it is definitely worth it,'' Ms. Schneider said. 
 Last year, they shopped all day and spent about $750. ''I got a ton of stuff, including a pair of Gucci shoes for $14,'' Ms. Schneider said. ''And mostly, I like shopping at a store that I know helps people out with job training.'' 
 The Glitter Sale itself was a record-setting success, bringing in $50,000 for Goodwill Industries, which provides job training and employment services, said Betsy McFeely, a spokeswoman.
 Ms. Schneider and Goodwill Industries represent the win-win phenomenon of trendy customers and nonprofit vintage stores. Clothing sales get most of the credit for the roughly 10 percent annual increase in revenue for the last 10 years at Goodwill's 2,078 shops around the United States, said Christine Nyirjesy Bragale, spokeswoman for Goodwill Industries International. While resale shops are usually in the furniture business, apparel is the biggest seller. 
 ''Clothing has become the dominant sales item because furniture is harder to pick up,'' said Major Paul Cranford, administrator for the Salvation Army Manhattan Adult Rehabilitation Center.
 The Salvation Army thrift shops provide on-the-job training for many who would not get the chance in the private sector. ''Most of the people we help have alcohol or drug issues,'' he said. ''Some are from prisons or broken homes.''
 The National Association of Resale and Thrift Shops reported that there were more than 25,000 resale, consignment and thrift shops in the United States, and that the industry was experiencing a growth of about 5 percent a year. 
 The association estimated that 16 to 18 percent of Americans shop in thrift stores, compared with about 11 percent who go to outlets and about 20 percent who shop in clothing or department stores. Last year, Goodwill sales totaled $1.64 billion. 
 Goodwill is not alone in benefiting from the popularity of vintage clothing. Salvation Army thrift shops in the New York metropolitan area, for example, had a 5 percent increase in profits last year, said Major Dennis Gensler, a spokesman.
 ''Goodwill is my favorite place on earth,'' said Rose Komesar, a student at Wesleyan University in Middleton, Conn. ''You're benefiting a charity, you're recycling.'' she said. ''Some students do their own tailoring of Goodwill clothes using old sewing machines they bought at Goodwill.'' Ms. Komesar added that she also donates clothes to Goodwill.
 Ricky Becker, manager of the Vintage Thrift Shop near Gramercy Park in Manhattan, said that it was not unusual, nor did it hurt business, when celebrities like Paul McCartney and Chloe Sevigny browsed. 
 ''But we have students, we have neighborhood people -- including a regular who is a 96-year-old lady in the neighborhood -- and we have lots of Japanese tourists,'' Mr. Becker said. ''I have people who come in here every single day that we're open. The men's stuff has just taken off.'' 
 The shop benefits the United Jewish Council of the East Side. ''Five years ago,'' said Toni Boston, the store supervisor, ''I went through their job training program that is supposed to help unemployed women prepare for the real world. It's opened a lot of doors for me. I have become knowledgeable about antiques and designer clothing.'' 
 The nine Angel View Thrift Stores in Palm Springs, Calif., which provide therapeutic services to disabled children, have had double-digit increases in sales over the past 10 years, said Tracy Powers, general manager of the stores. He said that last year, the stores' net donation to their mission doubled because of a change in strategy. In the past, he said, they had concentrated their advertising on getting customers. More recently, they have focused on getting more people to donate goods. 
 ''The desert is tremendously wealthy,'' he said. ''People go away for the summer and want to have the house redecorated, and donate the entire contents of the house to us.'' 
 Major Cranford said that clothing donations to the Salvation Army have increased drastically over the past 20 years. Last year, he said, clothing sales were up by about $250,000. 
 Some shops become the darlings of fashion editors and well-known designers. Oscar de la Renta donates clothing and accessories to the City Opera Thrift Shop near Gramercy Park, the only thrift shop in New York City that supports the arts, said the store manager, Jay Thompson. ''We are very event-driven,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''We hold the good designer stuff -- Missoni, Chanel, Pucci, Diane Von Furstenberg and others -- for what we call Vintage Events twice a year.'' He also stages Diva Events, featuring new designer clothing donated from the garment district. 
 This year, the Diva and Vintage Events, each only three to four hours, raised more than $100,000 for the shop, Mr. Thompson said.
 The Spence-Chapin Thrift Shop on the Upper East Side, which benefits Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children, an adoption agency, also receives many designer vintage suits and handbags, said its manager, Tina Brivic. ''No matter what it looks like, if it's a Chanel suit, they'll buy it.'' 
 All this is not to say that donations to resale shops always keep up with demand. Or, as Lisa Barrow, manager of the Salvation Army thrift shop in Riverhead, N.Y., said, ''Vintage -- boom -- gone.''

HEADLINE: Wireless Technology To Bind an African Village

BYLINE: By MATT VILLANO

 BODY:
NEAR Fort Portal, Uganda, where modern resources are scarce and power outages occur daily, four remote villages are harnessing solar-powered computers, wireless networks and telephones to help farmers compete in the regional economy. The computer-and-telephone system, designed by the San Francisco nonprofit group Inveneo, also enables villagers to surf the Web, build databases, use e-mail and make phone calls over the Internet -- a big assist considering that the nearest land-line phone is two miles away.
 The impact has been immediate. Computer literacy among the 3,200 residents of the region is on the rise. The municipal governments have used the technology to organize records and cut back on paper files. 
 The local economy is benefiting as well, said Jane Nabwire, information technology officer of the project. In an e-mail message from Fort Portal, Ms. Nabwire said that farmers used the technology to call friends in larger cities and obtain market prices for produce before deciding whether the trek to town is worth it. ''The technology has brought services to people where they can access developmental information at any time,'' she wrote. ''In every possible way, it has made life for us easier.''
 To users in the United States who can pay bills online and answer e-mail on their cellphones, these technologies may not seem so vital. But in countries like Uganda, the gift of information and communications technology can change an entire area's perspective on the world.
 Many call this practice technophilanthropy, though the equipment involved is not always donated. Inveneo, although a nonprofit group, sells its technology to nongovernmental organizations, which supply it to areas in need. Another nonprofit, the AED-Satellife Center for Health Information and Technology in Watertown, Mass., gets financing through grants and gives the technology away.
 Jody Mahoney, senior director of international development at TechSoup, a nonprofit technology assistance agency in San Francisco, said that however the two groups arranged for payment for these projects, they shared a belief that technology can help developing nations help themselves.
 ''No one solution is going to work,'' she said. ''The best way to get technology into these nations is to create an ecosystem of partners that give people the tools they need to get things done.''
 Inveneo's efforts revolve around these partners. In 2003, two of its co-founders, Mark Summer and Robert Marsh, developed a wireless communications system for villagers in Laos while volunteering for a nongovernmental organization there.
 Last year, they took the technology to Uganda, teaming with ActionAid. Together, the two groups chose a town called Bukuuku for an economic development pilot program because the villagers were farmers who earned less than a dollar a day.
 Since then, the effort has expanded greatly, including the setup in the Fort Portal area. Mr. Summer, who now serves as Inveneo's chief executive, said that by the end of the year it would be supporting 18 projects in Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, Mali and Guinea-Bissau.
 At the AED-Satellife Center, the focus is on medicine with two goals: to disseminate information to health workers all over the world and to give nations like Rwanda and Uganda the ability to use technology to revolutionize the way they keep medical records.
 Crucial to this effort is a network of hand-held computers. With the help of a special wireless access point, the hand-held devices transmit information about patients from field offices to regional ministries of health. 
 The network, much like computers from Inveneo, runs on solar and battery power, and is meant to replace the paper-based record-keeping that characterized so many of these countries for years. Andrew Sideman, AED-Satellife's director of development, said this information was important because it helped doctors decide how resources were allocated.
 ''The gathering of health information doesn't sound very exciting, but it's the basis for how decisions are made,'' he said, adding that the Satellife network also enables Web surfing and e-mail communication for villagers and doctors alike. ''In meeting this need, we hope to improve the overall health of this part of the world.''
 So far in Uganda, Satellife has accomplished that goal. For years, when pregnant women gave birth, doctors had 72 hours afterward to dispatch a messenger to pick up a refrigerated dose of Nevirapine, a drug that kills H.I.V. in newborns and is routinely administered.
 Today, under the new system, the doctors send out e-mail queries as the mother is about to give birth, so the drug is there when the baby is born. 
 Somebody has to pay for this kind of project, and in Satellife's case, the network is underwritten by grants, including $1 million from the International Development Aid Research Center, the Canadian government organization akin to the United States Agency for International Development.
 Inveneo, on the other hand, finances its projects by selling the technology to nongovernmental organizations and other parties for $2,000 each. Inveneo then reinvests these funds into the company by buying new technology and making more computers to distribute in other developing nations.
 Skeptics question how important these efforts are to nations where people are dying of starvation. But Ms. Mahoney, the director of TechSoup, disagrees.
 ''Technology can be a tool to save people's lives,'' she said. ''Anything that enables these people to share information is a step in the right direction.''

HEADLINE: A Scarred Region Mends, With Help From Many Friends

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: New Orleans 

 BODY:
WHEN Dave Kelly decided to head to New Orleans from his home in Clinton, N.J., to help rebuild this sodden city, it was a choice of the heart, not the head. ''My wife thought I was pretty nuts,'' he said. 
 But, he said, he thought that ''getting involved was more than writing a check, watching TV, wringing my hands and saying, 'this is horrible.' ''
 So last November, he took a week off from work, kissed his wife and two children goodbye, and showed up in New Orleans. He had called ahead to a relief organization, Samaritan's Purse, and it offered to put him to work gutting homes.
 It was back-wrenching, smelly work for Mr. Kelly, a stocky contract manager for AT&T. And yet, ''Three, four hours after I started working there,'' he said, ''I was thinking of how to get back.'' 
 By last month, he was on his third trip -- taking a group of friends from his church as a core team for Samaritan's Purse, which is headed by Franklin Graham, the son of the evangelist Billy Graham. 
 The devastation that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita spread across the Gulf Coast last year still hangs over much of New Orleans. Mary Croom-Fontenot, executive director of All Congregations Together, a coalition of houses of worship in New Orleans, said the devastation was still so widespread that volunteers would be needed for years to come. 
 ''Whatever it is we do, we have to nurture and carry along for 10 years, even 20 years,'' she said. ''That's what planners are telling us. There's not a quick fix.''
 Still, extraordinary disaster has brought forth an extraordinary response. Billions of dollars in contributions poured into the Red Cross and other charities from all over the world. Along with the dollars, however, hundreds of thousands of people arrived at the Gulf Coast to assist, too. 
 The way that they have all come together, unbidden, is striking. A seemingly chaotic process transforms streams of volunteers from around the nation into efficient squads of helpers. People find groups to work with, sign up and go. Though it acts more like a swarm than a hierarchy, the efforts are certainly different from the way that, say, the Corps of Engineers builds a levee. 
 And it works. Jim Pate, the executive director of the New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity, said that the statistics were impressive, but the sight of all the people is more so. ''This has got to be the largest outpouring of volunteer support in history,'' he said.
 Many of the volunteers are young. Some 219,000 college students worked in the gulf from 500 institutions over the last year, said Robert T. Grimm, director of research and policy development at the Corporation for National and Community Service, the government's largest grant maker for volunteer efforts and the manager of AmeriCorps. More than 35,000 national service participants have given more than 1.6 million hours of hands-on help to survivors and evacuees of Hurricane Katrina, he said.
 But helping rebuild New Orleans is not just a young persons' pursuit. Professional groups that have come to the city as part of the tent pole of its economy -- conventions -- have found time to lend a hand. 
 About 1,000 librarians of the group of about 18,000 in for their annual convention in June took time to rebuild some of the city's damaged libraries. And several hundred workers from Avaya, a telecommunications company, took time during their annual convention to pitch in as well, said Louis J. D'Ambrosio, the company's chief executive. The group met at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, which itself was restored from being a pit of horror and despair, and went to fix up a school.
 The convention appealed to the company on many levels, he said. Even those of the company's 4,000 visitors who would not lift a crowbar could make a contribution, he said, simply by coming to the city, putting money in the hands of local people and the government. ''It's purchases that are generating the tax dollars that the city needs,'' he said.
 Of course, sometimes visitors try to do a bit of celebrating and rebuilding. Mr. Pate of Habitat said the results were not pretty. ''Sometimes, when they've been out partying the night before,'' he said, ''we wish they wouldn't come out,'' he said, only half joking. 
 He spoke not long after dawn under a startlingly blue sky, watching more than 100 people streaming into a cleared lot that Habitat for Humanity uses as its staging ground for the cluster of houses nearby known as Musicians' Village. 
 Close by, young AmeriCorps volunteers in a rotation from Charleston, S.C., huddled in the morning chill. Not far from them stood participants in a Pfizer sales meeting who had taken a morning away from a conference. A bit farther away, a team from the American Logistics Association was readying itself for the labors ahead. And three buses of conventioneers from the insurance industry drove up. 
 Many in New Orleans have found the work of volunteers more useful than the efforts of government or business. Irving Johnson III, who is 47, said his family was helped by a number of charities after the storm -- including Samaritan's Purse, which cleaned out his home and his mother's in New Orleans. The volunteers, he said, sped him on the way to rebuilding his home while allowing him to keep his job as a photographer on the staff of Xavier University.
 ''They have been a lifesaver,'' he said. He found himself frustrated again and again by government and corporate bureaucracies. 
 ''Everything is a stumbling block,'' said his mother, Judith Johnson. ''Everybody tells you about e-mail. I say: 'I don't own a toothpick. What makes you think I have an e-mail address? I don't have a house address.' They say, 'Well, you can fax it to us.' And I say, 'On what?' And she says, 'Ma'am, you don't have a fax machine?' And I said, 'I don't even have a bed.' ''
 By comparison, Irving Johnson said, he was heartened by the ability of the charities to get things done. ''Somehow, on a lower budget with a lot less overhead,'' he said, ''the volunteers have gotten it right.''
 The distinction is not always clear. Large charities like the Red Cross, after all, have bureaucracies that rival the Pentagon's. The Red Cross raised $2 billion and mobilized some 235,000 volunteers to work across the region. But the group came under fire for being slow to gear up, especially when helping minority communities. The group recently announced a reorganization intended to address the problems Katrina revealed. 
 Even government officials say that the charitable organizations are filling a gap that government has not. 
 ''It would be the testimony of every person along the gulf that without the volunteer groups, we would not be where we are today,'' said Donald Powell, the federal coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding. 
 Government might help finance some faith-based organizations, he said, but ''Government doesn't necessarily hold hands or hug.'' Along with homes, the charitable groups ''fix the emotions and the soul.''
 The volunteers, using word of mouth and the Internet, find the group that fits them -- whether religious or secular, politically conservative or progressive. Although the faith-based groups have received much of the attention, groups like Common Ground come at the New Orleans disaster with a socially active sensibility. 
 It has drawn its own brand of more than 10,000 volunteers, who have gutted and cleaned more than 1,000 homes, but also run clinics and provided legal advice on allegations of abuse by the police. 
 ''Social justice activists and those with a progressive consciousness were drawn to us,'' said Lisa Fithian, a coordinator for the group. In the days after the storm, she said, ''they saw the militarization, saw the racism and knew that they had to do something.'' 
 Each group also finds its particular challenge. Jewish volunteers hoping to help rebuild the temples and homes of the congregations overwhelmed the Jewish Federation of Greater New Orleans, which steered them to larger volunteer agencies and provided information at jewishnola.com. For volunteers hoping to work in southwest Louisiana, land of crawfish and boudin sausage, the site warns, ''If your volunteer group is in need of kosher food items, you will not find them in this area.''
 For Ms. Fontenot of All Congregations Together, the biggest worry is a drop in the number of volunteers as the memory of the disaster -- and the media coverage -- recedes. ''The energy behind this, the Katrina campaign, seems to be dying out,'' she said. 
 The recent smattering of good news out of the city -- Mardi Gras, the New Orleans Saints' return to the Superdome -- might mislead people around the nation to believe that all is well, she said, adding: ''We continue to need help. Neighborhoods are not back.''
 The neighborhood that Mr. Kelly and his team worked in during their October visit in Chalmette, just east of New Orleans, is certainly not back. In fact, it is doubly blighted. The Murphy Oil plant nearby accidentally released more than a million gallons of mixed crude oil into the neighborhood, rendering homes even more foul. The mud that has caked onto every surface has a tough sheen. 
 ''It's kind of like a plastic or an enamel,'' Mr. Kelly said, showing off a hunk as tough as a poker chip. The team found a videocassette glued by the muck to a wall: ''Singin' in the Rain.'' 
 The home's owner, Louis Collura, who is 63, worked alongside the team, everyone wearing white Tyvek suits, goggles and respirators. His wife, Linda Collura, who is 60, sat under the carport with the salvageable pieces of their life around her. There was a jewelry box and a punchbowl. Other items were damaged but too precious to toss, and Mr. Collura loaded them into the back of his truck: a rifle and a BB gun given to Mr. Collura by his father some 50 years before. The words Red Ryder were stamped into the stock in rope letters. 
 ''I was expecting everything to be totally destroyed,'' Mrs. Collura said happily. Having survived brain cancer in the 1980s, she said she has learned to take things as they come. 
 Inside the house, hammers and pry bars worked at Sheetrock, which gave a screech of nails on wood as it pulled away. Mrs. Collura, when asked if she would move back into the home, said, ''I doubt it very seriously.'' For now, they simply wanted the house stripped to the studs to avoid having the property seized by the parish as blighted and to qualify for the legal settlement with the oil company.
 The sweaty, dusty effort will help the Colluras, said Eric Sween, one of the muckers, but he added that there was still frustration in cleaning out a house that will, at best, be demolished. ''Our team could have been doing work in someone else's house who will move back in,'' he said. 
 The volunteers worked from the ground up, clearing the floors and then taking out counters, couches and cabinets and appliances. The Sheetrock sat in a pile in front of the house, seven feet high and growing with each passage of the wheelbarrow. A ruined couch still had its price tag; the Colluras had finished remodeling their home just weeks before the storm. 
 Everest Hunter, who came to the group from a Presbyterian church in Syracuse, breathed heavily through his mask as he drilled and pounded. ''This is like a little kid's birthday party,'' he said. ''We get to rip everything up and destroy it -- and for a good cause!''
 When asked why they come, some volunteers speak of their faith, or of their sympathy for people who have lost so much, or simply, like Mr. Kelly, of not being able to sit idly by. Especially after having been to the Gulf Coast and seen the devastation that they try to describe to friends; especially after having felt the unimaginable need of the place.
 The why is not so important, they say. What is important is to go.
 A few weeks before this third trip, Mr. Kelly sat down with two friends in Clinton who had accompanied him on his second: Steve and Nancy Hovey. In March, they had gone together and worked side by side to gut two homes, including Judith Johnson's. Sitting in their own handsome home, they reminisced over their trip: of a life's collected possessions so glommed together by water and mud that the piles had to be taken apart with pickaxes and shovels. They gave a grim laugh recalling the horrible moment when an impulsive volunteer from North Carolina decided to lighten a freezer by drilling a hole to drain it -- and sent a vile stream of liquefied rotten shrimp splashing over clothes and into boots. And they talked of praying with Mrs. Johnson after cleaning out her home.
 And they paused. They would have accompanied Mr. Kelly on the October trip, but Mr. Hovey was awaiting hip replacement surgery and would not be able to make another trip until some time in 2007. 
 But the memories had a tug to them. Nancy Hovey looked at her husband and said, ''Now we really have to go back.''
 ''I know,'' Steve replied. 
 Turning to a visitor, Nancy Hovey explained. ''It gets you.''

HEADLINE: Truth About the Trade Deficit

 BODY:
Just as the summer driving season was winding down, oil prices started to fall. The combination of less demand and lower prices was a potent mix, helping to narrow the United States' trade gap significantly in September, to $64.3 billion from $69 billion in August, according to the latest tally. 
 That's welcome news, illustrating yet another upside to curbing the nation's oil consumption. But it's also sobering. The decline in September's trade deficit was the largest in nearly two years. And yet, the United States remains squarely on track for a record trade imbalance in 2006: a projected $790 billion, compared with $717 billion last year.
The Bush administration has played down the dangers of bloated deficits. Acknowledging them would compel an effort to tame the borrow-and-spend ways of the past six years, including curbing the tax cuts that have been such a boon to the rich. 
 Far too many Congressional Democrats have blamed China's cheap currency for the trade deficit and sought a solution in protectionism. The currency complaint has a grain of truth, but it is overly simplistic and could be self-defeating if it led to global protectionism.
 So, both camps are off point. With the deficit reaching new highs and Democrats now able to wield real power, it is crucial that each side back off its constituent-pleasing myths. 
 The Bush administration needs to tell the truth about the vulnerability that comes with large deficits. Thus far, the United States has had no problem attracting money from abroad to plug the gaps. But there is no guarantee that will continue indefinitely. If foreigners chose to invest elsewhere -- like the strengthening economies of Europe or Japan -- the result would be higher interest rates and higher prices in America, perhaps sharply higher. 
 The Democrats need to take a more pragmatic view of the lopsided trade situation. The surest way to make American businesses more competitive -- and workers more secure -- is to resolve the nation's health care mess. And the government needs to update and strengthen the safety net for workers who are hurt by global competition. As recently as a few years ago, economists warned that a nation was courting a financial crisis if the size of its trade deficit exceeded 3 percent of its economy. Today, the United States' deficit is approaching 7 percent. The best way to avoid the worst is to define the problem honestly, and craft the remedies accordingly.

HEADLINE: The Fading Dream

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
''America moved me all over again -- it was an amazing place, the idea of it astounding.'' --Arthur Miller

 Rumsfeld is exiting stage left and the curtain is coming down on George W. Bush's Theater of the Absurd. A rival company is setting up shop and expectations are high.
O.K., Democrats. Now what? Inquiring minds want to know if the new troupe will make us laugh, cheer, or cry. 
 First, let's stipulate that there are limits to what the party can achieve in the next two years, even with control of both houses of Congress. But the two most important tasks facing the Democrats are doable. The first is to ensure that Congress fulfills its constitutional obligation to impose a check on the excesses of the executive. 
 The second task is to respond to the anxiety that has seeped through much of the electorate about the state of the nation. Americans are worried about the war, the political and economic situation here at home, the way the U.S. is perceived by the rest of the world, and the direction in which the country is heading.
 The Democrats didn't win the off-year elections, the Republicans lost them. And I'm convinced that the Republicans lost because while they were in charge (''Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job'') millions of Americans began to lose confidence in those things that had moved them about America -- its awesome power to do good, its ethical underpinnings, and most important, that incredible array of qualities that fell under the magical, mystical heading, the American dream.
 A real-life metaphor for what has happened to America occurred last week on the west side of Manhattan. After inviting hundreds of well-wishers to watch, officials had planned to tow the aircraft carrier Intrepid from its dock to a facility on the other side of the Hudson River, where it would undergo a major overhaul. But when the time for its departure arrived, the Intrepid, which has served for years as a popular Sea, Air and Space Museum, could not be budged. It was stuck in the mud beneath the river.
 The Intrepid was commissioned in 1943, when the U.S. still knew how to win wars. Its active history encompassed that extraordinary post-World War II period when bold leadership and a sense of common purpose transformed the U.S. and made it the envy of the world. That leadership and sense of common purpose has since been largely lost.
 The elite now send other people's children off to fight and die in wars that are unwinnable. On the home front, a two-tiered economy has been put in place in which a small percentage of the population does extremely well while a majority of working Americans are in an all-but-permanent state of anxiety about job security, pensions, the economic impact of globalization, the cost of health care, college tuition, and so on.
 For perhaps the first time in history, there is a large swath of Americans who are worried that over the long haul their children will not fare as well as they have.
 For resurgent Democrats there is no better touchstone right now than Franklin Roosevelt. He understood the corrosive effects of prolonged economic insecurity and the essential need for cooperation in the effort to build a successful society. His goal was ''to make a country in which no one is left out.''
 Roosevelt had both the vision and the political skills, including an indestructible sense of optimism, to galvanize the nation in some of its darkest hours. Those qualities have been in short supply among the terminally timid Democrats of recent years.
 Last week, the voters gave the Democrats another opportunity to lead, not just on the war in Iraq, but on such questions as how best to deal with globalization, how to make real progress toward energy independence, and how to ensure that the economic benefits of a wealthy nation are more equitably shared.
 What voters really want to know is whether the American dream will still be there for the next generation.
 In Congress over the next two years, and in the presidential campaign of 2008, the Democrats will have to respond to that question with a coherent vision of the nation's future and a cadre of leaders who, like Roosevelt, can convey that vision convincingly and optimistically.
 There's a reason why the Democratic figure generating the most excitement at the moment, Barack Obama, titled his latest book, ''The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream.''

HEADLINE: Another Hurdle for G.O.P.: A New Chairman Is Needed

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Stephen J. Minarik III will step down as state Republican chairman, party leaders said yesterday, adding new uncertainty to the party's direction following its worst defeat in New York since the Great Depression.
 Joseph N. Mondello, the longtime Nassau County Republican chairman, is the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Minarik, officials said. Some upstate Republicans raised questions about choosing a downstate leader whose track record includes losing control of his county's government, but they conceded that they knew of no other serious contenders for the job.
Mr. Mondello, 68, has the backing of Mr. Minarik and Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican State Senate majority leader, according to several officials who were granted anonymity to speak of matters that none of the three leaders want discussed publicly until they have consulted with all 62 county chairmen. Mr. Minarik plans to have the state committee meet late this month to elect a new chairman. 
 With the Democrats' sweep of statewide offices Tuesday, Mr. Bruno will become the most powerful Republican in state government, giving him considerable influence over the choice.
 Ryan Moses, executive director of the statewide party, and others confirmed that Mr. Minarik would leave the post of state chairman, which was reported by The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle yesterday. He will stay on as party chairman of Monroe County, where Rochester is located, giving him continued influence within the party statewide.
 Mr. Minarik, 46, who became state chairman two years ago, had hinted that he might step down after the election, and party leaders insisted that the results had nothing to do with his decision. In fact, some said Mr. Bruno had asked him to stay on.
 ''The chairman had made the promise to Governor Pataki and Senator Bruno that he would go through the election and then we would talk about it,'' Mr. Moses said. ''It's a tough job and Steve has four young kids.''
 But some other Republican officials had said that if Mr. Minarik did not go willingly, he should be pushed out in light of this year's travails, culminating in last week's crushing defeat.
 Spokesmen for Mr. Minarik and Mr. Bruno said that they would not comment on the resignation. Mr. Mondello did not return phone calls seeking comment.
 In January, Democrats will hold every statewide elected post, including both seats for United States Senate, for the first time since 1942. Republicans lost three Congressional seats and nearly lost three others, so Democrats will hold a 23-to-6 advantage in the New York delegation.
 The ascension of Mr. Mondello, a county chairman for more than two decades, could mark something of a comeback for a Nassau party that was once one of the nation's vaunted local political machines. For decades, it reliably delivered votes and money for statewide and national candidates, exercising near-total control of county government, and producing an Assembly speaker, a State Senate majority leader and a United States senator, Alfonse M. D'Amato.
 But the last decade has seen Democrats defeat Mr. D'Amato, capture both the county executive's post and a majority in the County Legislature, and make other inroads in Nassau -- much as they have in many other former Republican strongholds in New York. Nassau Republicans still have serious financial muscle, though, and more registered Republicans than any other county.
 In assessing Mr. Mondello, the loss of Republican control in Nassau ''was what popped into my head first,'' said Bob Smith, who recently retired as Onondaga County Republican chairman, and remains on the party's state committee.
 ''The new chair needs to be someone who has shown he can build the party back up again, county by county, be on the road every week, work more than full-time,'' he said. ''We don't have as much left to build on as we used to.''
 But Anthony Capozzi, the Broome County Republican chairman, said, like others, that he would defer to Mr. Bruno. ''I don't know Joe Mondello very well, but if Joe Bruno throws his weight behind Joe Mondello, that's good enough for me,'' he said.
 When Long Island held sway, it was not always welcomed by upstate Republicans, who saw their downstate brethren as too liberal and not concerned enough with upstate economic woes. Twelve years ago, those tensions helped Mr. Bruno topple his predecessor as Senate chief, Ralph J. Marino, who was from Nassau, and whose colleagues sometimes complained of feeling the influence of Mr. Mondello in state business.

HEADLINE: Poles Vote in Local Races Seen as First Test of Governing Coalition 

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: BERLIN, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Poles voted Sunday in local elections that analysts said would be the first test for the 14-month-old nationalist-conservative coalition that has promised to curb corruption and rid the government of senior former Communist officials. 
 What is at stake for Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski and his identical twin, Lech, who is president, is whether their Law and Justice Party will win sufficient votes in the big towns and cities, particularly Warsaw, the capital, to allow them to proceed with their program.
They face a strong challenge in Warsaw from Civic Platform, the pro-business party. Poles are voting for mayors in 2,500 jurisdictions and for 47,000 local council members. 
 Exit polls indicated that the Law and Justice Party might prevail but that a runoff would occur in Warsaw, news agencies reported. Preliminary results were not expected until Monday. 
 Law and Justice, which the Kaczynskis founded in 2001 as a breakaway party from Solidarity, the independent anti-Communist trade union movement, narrowly defeated Civic Platform last year after winning support from large parts of eastern Poland, where unemployment is more than 20 percent in some areas. 
 It also won in the industrial centers that have had to undergo economic restructuring to become competitive. The more prosperous western parts of Poland and the large cities voted for Civic Platform.
 A clear mandate for Law and Justice would allow the government to continue the anticorruption drive that has been the main focus of its policies for 14 months. During that time, however, the government has not established any clear foreign strategy, especially regarding the European Union, Germany and Russia. 
 The government, instead of establishing a stronger voice in the European Union, has tried to forge an even closer relationship with the United States. The Kaczynskis have been negotiating with the Bush administration over whether Poland would accept on its territory elements of the American missile defense system, which the United States has deployed in rudimentary form. 
 In return, the government is seeking a special security pact. Analysts said Sunday that the victory of the Democrats in the House of Representatives and the Senate might delay completion of the system.
 Even if the Kaczynskis received a strong mandate, they would still have to contend with their coalition partners. To maintain a parliamentary majority, they have been forced to share power with the League of Polish Families, a Roman Catholic party, and the more maverick populist Self-Defense led by Andrzej Lepper. 
 Mr. Lepper, a former Communist, was dismissed from the coalition last month after repeatedly criticizing the government. Jaroslaw Kaczynski brought him back because the government could not manage without his support in Parliament.
 In Warsaw, Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz of the Law and Justice Party -- whom Lech Kaczynski forced out as prime minister in July -- is running against the Civic Platform candidate, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, the former chief of Poland's central bank. A leftist candidate is also running. 
 Lech Kaczynski was mayor of Warsaw until October 2005, when he was elected president. During his tenure as mayor, he banned the city's annual gay pride rally and reduced the powers of the local boroughs. Each of the major candidates have pledged to pass control back to the boroughs.

HEADLINE: Step Right Up, Ladies and Gents, to See the End of an Oddity 

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF

DATELINE: YORK, Pa. 

 BODY:
Ward Hall, the King of the Midway, has perpetrated perhaps his greatest illusion. He has risen from the dead. He has collected up his big top, rustled up the midget, dusted off the rubber fetuses and beat it back out on the road. Once again, he is the geriatric front man of the last traveling freak show in America.
 Retirement just didn't sit right.
 ''I live in Florida but I never summered in Florida, and I discovered it's too damn hot,'' says Mr. Hall, standing inside his trailer in a back lot of the York Fair in Pennsylvania. He is in a white suit, stained on the elbows and rump. Some sequins have fallen off the lapel. 
 His freak show, the World of Wonders, has been shoved by the organizers to the back corner of the fairgrounds, next to the horse stables. 
 ''I missed the road life anyway,'' he goes on, his elegant vaudevillian verbiage nearly drowned out by the sound system of the whirling Himalaya thrill ride. ''I missed my friends. I missed the money. This is what I am.'' 
 And, returning to the nation's state fair circuit after a full season off, Mr. Hall has discovered something he already knew. When he goes, it will be the end of an old-time American art form.
 Back in the heyday, in the '40s, '50s and '60s, a fair number of people with deformities were happy to let you look at them for a price. Not only were freak shows the draw of the carnival, they were the carnival. 
 But like John Henry and the steam drill, the freak show was done in by the machine: the Plunger, the Tilt-a-Whirl, the Zipper. Before them, the carnival was strictly dancing monkeys and dancing dwarves and dancing fat ladies. There was the Ossified Woman. Lobster Boy. And they made a good life. Monkey Girl managed to buy a farm. 
 There was also the bearded lady, who found a lover when her husband was out of town and shaved to please him. But it turned out the lover preferred her with the beard and rejected her, as did her husband.
 ''Her husband, coming home after a few days and seeing the beard was gone, knew something was amiss,'' Mr. Hall said. ''He chased her down the midway with a gun.'' This is how it used to be on the road.
 ''Nowadays, it's in the contracts: no freaks,'' says Mr. Hall, who believes political correctness is putting people out of work. ''Do-gooders run things. I'm telling you, this life was very good for freaks. These kind of people made money. They were hams, but they could never be actors. Who's putting a bearded lady or a one-armed girl in a leading lady role on Broadway? This way they lived a great life. No more. It's ridiculous.''
 Mr. Hall ran away from his father's fourth-floor walk-up in Denver in 1946. The father mocked the boy, telling him he would come crawling back in two weeks.
 ''Those two weeks are yet to expire,'' he says with a cackle.
 Mr. Hall joined the circus at 15, became a clown, wasn't funny, realized people didn't pay to see unfunny clowns and committed to a career of getting knives thrown at him. 
 He never married, never had children: ''I've been blessed. I have not been burdened with that, dear sir.'' 
 Instead he has spent his life on the road, most of it with his disheveled, mutton-chopped, chain-smoking business partner, Chris Christ, 58, and with Poobah, the 3-foot-7-and-a-quarter-inch dwarf who, after eating 100 skewers of fire a day, 12 hours a day, seven days a week for five decades, has no eyebrows or eyelashes to speak of, giving him the look of a pale jack-o'-lantern. Poobah has a knot on his forehead, wears a hearing aid the size of a bagel, has low blood pressure and speaks with a deep, incomprehensible gurgle. Clearly, fire has taken its toll. 
 The three men have toured Mexico, Canada and the entire United States. Today, they travel together in the same trailer, the place smelling of old men and ashes. In the off-season, they spend the winter in Gibsonton, Fla., known as Showtown U.S.A., where many freaks used to live. It is thought to be the only city in America where zoning allows people to park an elephant in the front yard.
 Some men go for golf when they grow old. Others make model boats. Mr. Hall sells fantasy. He hauls himself up from his chair, adjusts his bow tie in the mirror. Break time is over. It is his turn on the microphone. The show is never ending, going round and round like a carousel. 
 ''Technology killed the art form, too,'' Mr. Hall says, unable to get the tie straight.
 Separating Siamese twins at birth? 
 ''Can't they just leave well enough alone?'' 
 Cleft palate? 
 ''Plastic surgery.'' 
 ''It's a shame,'' he says. ''I don't know where to get my freaks.'' He advertises in the trades. Few people answer.
 Then there is the strange but true fact that American society has gone just plain freaky itself, Mr. Hall believes.
 ''The fat man -- Howard Huge -- he wanted to come out with us. But I said, 'Howard, a fat man couldn't sell 10 cents' worth of fried chicken. Everybody in America's fat.' '' 
 You want to see a fat man, Mr. Hall says, try the Cracker Barrel, you'll see a dozen at once. Same with the tattooed lady. Ditto with pierced women. Nothing special.
 Mr. Hall steps out into the sweltering sun, climbs onto the platform in front of the marquee and begins the pitch. ''Ladies and gentlemen, now come watch as Poobah will eat fire.''
 Sitting in a little pink lawn chair, Poobah looks run-down. It is nearly 100 degrees, the air as sticky as lemonade. It seems cruel, as he is only four years away from 80, but that's show business. 
 Poobah is the attraction, the only physical oddity left. Poobah is the draw that gets the dupes standing out there in flip-flops, holding on to their plastic Spider-Man blowup dolls, to pay three bucks to go inside and see a man stick a screwdriver up his nose, a sword swallower with periodontal disease, an eight-foot woman made of foam. Her left foot is broken off, and she needs a dusting. Once inside, seeing they've been lied to, people get hostile.
 ''Now, Poobah here is the king of the Pygmies,'' Mr. Hall yaps. The crowd comes closer. 
 Poobah's real name is Pete Terhurne.
 ''Poobah comes all the way from Beverly Hills.'' 
 Poobah grew up in Minnesota, met Mr. Hall at a carnival there in the mid-'50s. 
 ''Poobah is the last living munchkin from 'The Wizard of Oz.' '' 
 Poobah first saw the movie as a television rerun.
 ''He is the star of 84 Hollywood pictures, 114 television shows and numerous Broadway musicals.'' 
 Poobah couldn't sing to save his life. But Poobah says he doesn't mind. It's a living. He says he loves Mr. Hall. And it beats retirement.
 ''Now, watch as Poobah eats the fire.''
 Poobah does so for the umpteenth time today.

SOUTH OSSETIANS' INDEPENDENCE DRIVE GETS LITTLE SUPPORT: The unrecognized republic of South Ossetia held presidential elections and a controversial referendum on independence from Georgia on Sunday. While official results had not been announced by the time of publication, for the major newspapers, the outcome was obvious: the majority of South Ossetia's 92,000 residents chose sovereignty and reelected their current president Eduard Kokoiti, a strong advocate for independence. 
 Of greater concern than the actual referendum was the international response. From the outset, the European Union and the United States joined Georgia in declaring the plebiscite illegitimate, Nezavisimaya Gazeta wrote. Instead, South Ossetian officials were counting on support from Russia and other post-Soviet countries. While the Russian government stopped short of recognizing the election's legitimacy, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement that regardless of international reactions, the referendum would show the will of the people, the newspaper reported. 
 International observers from several countries, including Spain, Venezuela, Latvia, Germany and Austria, arrived in South Ossetia's capital to monitor the vote, said Kommersant. Also present, the newspaper wrote, were representatives from the other unrecognized republics in the region: Transnistria, Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
 Georgia took a number of steps to undermine the referendum. Georgian authorities, Gazeta reported, blocked roads through Georgian populated regions of South Ossetia and cut telephone communications. Nezavisimaya Gazeta wrote that the South Ossetian government accused Tbilisi of planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks in the region as well as plotting to assassinate Mr. Kokoiti. Georgian officials denied the charges. 
 Georgia held an alternative referendum in South Ossetian villages with Georgian majorities: contrary to the separatist referendum, they did not mention the prospect of independence. Instead, Kommersant reported, the ballot asked voters whether or not they supported a start to negotiations with Georgia on the creation of a federal state. Georgian officials said they were surprised by the high turnout for the Tbilisi-organized referendum, the newspaper wrote. A spokesman for the South Ossetian Central Elections Commission, however, said that the alternative vote took place in just one village, Eredvi. 
 Russia and Georgia, with their relations under severe stress, used the occasion of the referendum for diplomatic wrangling. Officials in Tbilisi criticized what it called Russia's anti-Georgian policies, Nezavisimaya Gazeta wrote. They also accused Moscow of escalating tensions in the region, said Rossiiskaya Gazeta. Moscow said that Tbilisi's hard-line policies on South Ossetia had driven the republic's leaders to seek independence, the newspaper reported.

 LAW STRIPS NEW PARTY OF MEMBERS: When the Russian Party of Life, the Pensioner's Party and Motherland formed the new A Just Russia party last month, newly-elected deputies from the parent organizations lost their party status under Russia's election law. Russian law says that an elected official can only represent the party for which he or she was registered at the time of elections. The deputies in question must now renounce all party affiliation or resign their posts. 
 NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA
 LAW TO STRIP PARTIES OF FOREIGN FINANCING: Several State Duma deputies proposed legislation on Friday that would forbid nongovernmental organizations from financing Russian political parties during elections. Current law allows for organizations with foreign assets totaling less than 30 percent to finance political parties. President Vladimir V. Putin said as early as summer last year that he was categorically against the use of foreign funding for political activities in Russia.

 RUSSIA TO SIGN W.T.O. AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES: Russia's minister of economic development, German Gref, and an American trade representative announced on Friday that an agreement signifying the end of bilateral negotiations between Russia and the United States on Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization could be signed by the end of this week during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Hanoi, Vietnam. Mr. Gref said he hoped Russia would complete final membership talks within six months. The W.T.O.'s press secretary said, however, that the process could take much longer.

 OUR UKRAINE JOINS OPPOSITION: Members of President Viktor A. Yushchenko's Our Ukraine party on Saturday voted to join the opposition despite the president's urgings to the contrary. Nevertheless, party representatives confirmed their continued support for Mr. Yushchenko, but charged party deputies with introducing into Parliament a motion of no confidence aimed at Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich. Members almost unanimously agreed to appeal to the Constitutional Court with a request to repeal earlier constitutional amendments investing the Parliament with additional powers.

GOING PUBLIC -- Among this week's more noteworthy public offerings is one for Hertz Global Holdings, below, the car rental company that became private less than a year ago. The private equity firms that bought Hertz from the Ford Motor Company for $15 billion in cash and debt are planning to sell 88.2 million shares for $16 to $18 apiece. Another -- and more unusual -- offering that is expected is one for Nymex Holdings, which operates the futures exchange and clearinghouse, specializing in futures contracts for commodities like energy and metals. The plan is to offer 6.5 million shares for $48 to $52 a share. 


SCRUTINY FOR A MERGER -- The House Armed Services Committee has scheduled a hearing for Tuesday on the national security implications of a plan by the French company Alcatel to buy Lucent Technologies, the American maker of telephone equipment. Because Lucent does classified work for the federal government, Representative Duncan Hunter, the California Republican who is chairman of the committee, has said that he is concerned about the $11 billion deal, which would create the largest global maker of telecommunications equipment. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is overseen by Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, is also reviewing the transaction.

HOT STATS -- The potentially market-moving economic reports this week include the monthly retail sales data for October on Tuesday and the Consumer Price Index, industrial production and capacity utilization, all for October, on Thursday. On tap for Friday: housing starts for October.

EARNINGS IN FASHION -- Expect a deluge of earnings reports from the nation's biggest retail chains -- like Wal-Mart Stores and Sears -- and a long list of apparel specialists and department stores. Highlights include: Tyson Foods (Monday); Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters, BJ's Wholesale Club, Home Depot, HSBC Holdings, TJX Companies, Target, Saks, Staples, Vodafone and Wal-Mart (Tuesday); Limited Brands, Petsmart, Salesforce.com and Tyco International (Wednesday); Barnes & Noble, Dell, Gap, Hewlett-Packard, Sears Holdings and Starbucks (Thursday); and AnnTaylor Stores and Foot Locker (Friday).

HEADLINE: A Charity With an Unusual Interest in the Bottom Line

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
THE idea befuddled donors and Internal Revenue Service lawyers alike when Jacqueline Novogratz approached them six years ago. A philanthropic venture capital fund? 
 On one hand, the Acumen Fund would be a nonprofit charity. On the other, it would invest in companies and groups that tackled global poverty.
 It was an unusual idea to pitch to philanthropists, said Ms. Novogratz. ''They had never seen an organization like us: raising charitable money but wanting the flexibility of grants, loans and equity investments in for-profit and nonprofit organizations.'' 
 Ms. Novogratz, who has an M.B.A., has backgrounds in both in finance and philanthropy and worked as a banker at Chase Manhattan and as a manager of special projects at the Rockefeller Foundation before starting Acumen. She established a foothold in international philanthropy in 1986 when she went to Rwanda and worked on microfinance projects, long before the words ''microfinance'' or ''Rwanda'' entered the social lexicon. 
 She may have been ahead of her time. But two key people intuitively grasped the Acumen Fund's mission: Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders of Google, whom Ms. Novogratz first met at a Technology Entertainment and Design conference two years ago. During the period when Google's new charitable foundation, Google.org, was defining itself, the company's founders knew they shared a vision with Ms. Novogratz -- a desire to reinvent philanthropy and push the boundaries of how people who had done well could also do good.
 ''We were looking at different models of philanthropy,'' said Sheryl Sandberg, a vice president at Google and a Google.org board member. ''We are looking at the most efficient and effective ways to solve the world's largest problems.''
 They saw a lot of potential in the Acumen Fund, which has invested in projects meant to help people on the lowest rungs of the socioeconomic ladder: drip irrigation systems in India, rural health clinics in Kenya and a low-cost mortgage program in Pakistan. 
 Acumen models itself after a venture capital fund and brings in management and entrepreneurial expertise to help build the companies' financial independence. To that end, Acumen has a mantra on business fundamentals on how to design, price, distribute and market goods and services. But the audience it is focusing on are people who live on less than $4 a day, and Acumen's goal is to provide them affordable, critical goods and services that have otherwise been neglected by the marketplace. So when Google.org was little more than a Web page promising information to come, the Acumen Fund appeared as its first partner. To date, the Acumen Fund has been the recipient of Google.org's largest-single grant: $5 million to strengthen Acumen's operations. ''It was a really progressive and thoughtful contribution,'' Ms. Novogratz said. ''It was about building the institution.'' 
 To further cement the ties, Google announced in September that the Acumen Fund would be moving from its offices overlooking Trinity Church in the financial district of Manhattan to Google's corporate offices in the Chelsea neighborhood uptown. ''We believe that our model and Jackie's model and Acumen's model is the next wave of philanthropy,'' Ms. Sandberg said. ''It's addressing the critical needs of the world's poor, but in much more of a venture capital mode: to use seed capital to address the world's problems and to do so in a sustainable way.'' 
 Among Acumen's most notable projects is an investment in International Development Enterprises in India, a nonprofit group that manufacturers a drip irrigation system that it sells to poor farmers for under $30, a fraction of the price of traditional irrigation systems. Because the cost is so modest, the increased land productivity helps the system pay for itself in a short time, Ms. Novogratz said. ''Their lives change almost overnight if they make that investment,'' she said. ''They see their income double or triple -- that allows them enough income to buy a second system. That is how they accumulate wealth.'' So far, more than 30,000 units have been sold.
 In the twin worlds of philanthropy and venture capital, where billion is a commonly used measure, the Acumen Fund can seem modest. It has about 29 full-time staff members and seven fellows in offices in New York, India, Pakistan and, soon, Kenya. Of the $40 million dollars it has raised since it formally began in 2001, it has distributed only around $20 million -- a small amount by traditional philanthropic standards. Yet Ms. Novogratz explained that the firm's approach was expensive. ''The business acumen costs money,'' she said. ''We are highly labor intensive.'' Many of the managers hold M.B.A's and have resumes studded with stints at Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse First Boston, McKinsey.
 Rather than simply focusing on potential profitability, Acumen evaluates projects for social impact, financial sustainability, replicability and what Ms. Novogratz calls ''breakthrough insights'' -- knowledge that can be applied elsewhere. 
 For example, they have spent a lot of time understanding when the poor act like mainstream customers and when they don't. Another insight prompted them to eliminate grants, and limit Acumen to loans and equity investments. ''Grants do not provide the same amount of clarity of expectations or financial discipline, or the same power as a conduit into more traditional financial markets,'' Ms. Novogratz said. 
 ''What we need in this sector is these kinds of ideas and models to get others to think frankly of doing their business in a similar way,'' said Allen S. Grossman, a professor at Harvard Business School who studies entrepreneurship in the social sector.
 Those insights are critical to charting new territory, said Dr. Grossman, who also advises Acumen. ''You can't take business practices and superimpose them when it comes to social issues,'' he said. ''What they do is a very effective social adaptation so that there is not a conflict between good business practices and achievement of a social mission.'' 
 But often local entrepreneurs do feel tension between business and philanthropy, said Yasmina Zaidman, who manages water projects for Acumen. They are caught because nonprofits tell them to ''stop making money off the poor'' while business executives say, ''If you want to make money, get serious, stop messing around in the rural areas,'' Ms. Zaidman added. ''They haven't been supported or acknowledged.''
 Like any investment fund, Acumen has its disappointments. Of 21 projects, 15 are still active. Last year, for example, Acumen pulled out of a fluoride filtration company in India when the company changed its strategy and started pursuing subsidized government contracts. ''It was frustrating, but that lesson has influenced us so much since then,'' Ms. Zaidman said. 
 An earlier project, centered around a $42 hearing aid, failed to take off in India despite the product's relatively low cost. ''We were jumping up and down thinking we hit the ball out of the park,'' Ms. Novogratz said. Acumen helped distribute 10,000 of the hearing aids, but low demand and a poor distribution network prevented it from becoming an independent business. ''We learned that technology alone does not solve problems,'' she said, ''and that what is as important -- or more important -- than the technology is the business model for bringing services to poor people.''
 While Ms. Novogratz was in Rwanda, she helped women there set up a bakerycalled Duterimbere, which means ''to go work with enthusiasm'' in the local Rwandan language. ''We cornered the snack food market,'' she said. 
 Her farewell present from the women was a tapestry depicting scenes from the bakery, the town and a local school. It blends into the Acumen office decor -- a mix of the dot-com aesthetic of Aeron chairs and ethnic handicrafts from Ms. Novogratz's travels. Glancing at the Rwandan tapestry, Ms. Novogratz said, ''Unfortunately, all the women created it were killed in the genocide, so it's even more important.'' She added, ''Acumen Fund is my prayer in response to genocide and what happened in Rwanda.''

HEADLINE: Putting Your Money Where Your Heart Lies

BYLINE: By KELLI B. GRANT

 BODY:
SALLY MENDZELA has accepted that she will never have the philanthropic clout of Warren Buffett or Bill Gates. Instead of getting discouraged about what she cannot offer, she has put all her financial assets to work to maximum effect. 
 ''My philanthropy philosophy is 'All money has power,' '' said Ms. Mendzela, a contractual disaster-assistance worker for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Though she lives in Providence, R.I., Ms. Mendzela recently opened a savings account and a certificate of deposit with Hope Community Credit Union in Jackson, Miss., which helps low-income residents in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. 
 ''I saw firsthand the destruction in Mississippi, in New Orleans,'' said Ms. Mendzela, who worked with victims of Hurricane Katrina. ''That experience made an impact on me in every conceivable way. I want to participate in the rebuilding.'' 
 Ms. Mendzela is putting her money to work by taking part in an increasingly popular type of philanthropy called community investing, which takes capital into poor neighborhoods by offering low-interest loans and financial services to residents and small businesses. Consumers help by investing in C.D.'s and savings and checking accounts or money market accounts at nonprofit community development institutions like credit unions. 
 Community investing is the fastest-growing segment of socially responsible investing, with assets jumping to $19.7 billion in 2005 from $13.7 billion in 2003, according to the Social Investment Forum, an industry group in Washington. Ms. Mendzela's account balances, as part of the credit union's assets, are continually reinvested in the community. She also gets a low 2 percent yield on her one-year Hurricane Relief C.D., enabling the credit union to offer more no-interest loans to hurricane survivors.
 One such loan of $1,500 from the credit union helped Sheila Randle rebuild her life. When Ms. Randle, 64, a former dispatcher with the local sheriff's office, evacuated New Orleans for Jackson, Miss., the day before the hurricane, she took little more than a change of clothes -- and ended up losing nearly everything in the floodwaters. 
 ''I didn't want to be a burden to my children,'' she said. ''We were all in the same boat, and somebody needed to step out of the boat, because it was tilting.''
 The credit union taught Ms. Randle how to rebuild her credit and how to bud-get her Social Security checks. They found her part-time employment with the city government. She used the loan to rent an apartment in Jackson before her FEMA settlement came through, and to replenish some of her belongings.
 At most community development financial institutions, just opening an account is enough to make a difference. ''You're creating a pool from which the institution can loan to others in the community,'' said Clifford Rosenthal, executive director of the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions. 
 Common programs include financial literacy courses, free tax preparation and individual development accounts, which offer two- or three-to-one matches on savings of low-income individuals for education, to buy a home or start a small business. 
 Ten years ago, Stacy Hart of Santa Cruz, Calif., needed a helping hand. Ms. Hart, an Army veteran and a single mother, was struggling near the poverty line, trying to start her own company, Hart Landscaping. 
 Assistance, Ms. Hart said, came in the form of an individual development account from the Santa Cruz Community Credit Union, which offered to match her small-business savings two to one. 
 Over five years, her account balance grew to $15,000. Today, with more assets than debts, Ms. Hart is on the giving end of community investing at the credit union. 
 ''I employ four people, and I can make sure they make enough to live well here,'' she said. ''The money is continuing to trickle down.'' 
 While most community financial institutions focus on helping their neighborhoods, some look at broader causes. ShoreBank Pacific, a community bank in Ilwaco, Wash., is devoted to environmental causes, like providing loans for sustainable small businesses or credit cards that offer a percentage of every purchase to Salmon Nation, a conservation project of Ecotrust, a nonprofit group in Portland, Ore. 
 To counterbalance their generous individual development accounts, low-interest loans and other programs, many community financial institutions offer below-market rates on interest-bearing accounts. 
 ''You're essentially accepting a lower rate to allow these credit unions to be in a business that no other big bank wants to be in,'' Mr. Rosenthal said. ''People say in socially responsible investing that you can do well by doing good. Sometimes it's better to do a little less well to do a little more good.''

HEADLINE: Growing a City, From the Roots Up

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: KALAMAZOO, Mich. 

 BODY:
WHEN economists and civic leaders discuss ideas to revive this state, the talk quickly converges on the need to increase the number of high school students who continue their education and graduate from college. 
 Nowhere else in Michigan, and perhaps in the rest of the country, has that goal materialized as fast as it has in this postindustrial city, where a group of anonymous donors established a fund that pays up to 100 percent of tuition and fees at any state college or university for graduates of Kalamazoo's three public high schools. It is called the Kalamazoo Promise, and came into fruition just a year ago.
In the graduating class of 2006, the first to qualify for the program, 400 students were eligible. About 90 percent of those took the offer. 
 But making a college education easier to attain was only a secondary priority of the Promise. The first was using the scholarship program as an economic development tool to put this struggling Rust Belt city in the southwestern part of the state -- and perhaps all of Michigan -- on the road to prosperity. 
 Dozens of families have moved into the Kalamazoo school district, which spans the city and parts of three neighboring townships. Home prices are on the rise after falling for several years. 
 In every corner of the city, and in other communities, the Kalamazoo Promise is celebrated as a remarkable innovation. 
 Ronald R. Kitchens, the chief executive of Southwest Michigan First, a nonprofit regional economic development agency, said that the Promise was already working in Kalamazoo, influencing an economic transition from a collapsed industrial past of paper and auto-related manufacturing to a new era of enterprise related to academics, science, medicine and engineering. 
 Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat who was elected to a second term last week, has proposed a Michigan Promise to award $4,000 to every high school graduate enrolling in a state college or university. Representatives from several cities have visited Kalamazoo to find lessons for their own communities. In February, Newton, Iowa, established the Newton Promise, a scholarship program modeled after Kalamazoo's. 
 ''We are all witnessing the tremendous impact that the Kalamazoo Promise is having,'' Governor Granholm said during a campaign stop here in September.
 The Promise is achieving results that major philanthropic projects generally take years to realize. 
 Student enrollment in Kalamazoo public schools reached a peak of 18,000 in the early 1970s and has steadily declined since. But in a turnaround this year, enrollment rose by 937 students to 11,091. 
 The Promise is viewed as so critical to the school system that in May voters easily approved an $85 million bond to build a new middle school and an elementary school, the first such buildings to go up in 35 years. 
 The Promise is also providing more money for curriculums and operations. The formula that Michigan uses to finance its schools provides Kalamazoo $7,500 per student, so the nearly 10 percent increase in enrollment will yield about $7 million more in school revenue this year. 
 By far the biggest secret in Kalamazoo, which has about 77,000 residents, is the donors' exact identities. A second mystery is why they asked for anonymity. Many here say it is related to self-effacing Midwestern values.
 Michelle Miller-Adams, a political scientist who is writing a book about the Kalamazoo Promise for the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, a local nonprofit group, is convinced that the anonymous approach was strategic. ''It means that the donors can't really control or interfere or influence this in a political way,'' she said. 
 Yet another secret lies in how the Promise is financed. The prevailing view is that the donors created an endowment estimated at $200 million to $250 million. 
 This year, the Promise will spend less than $2 million on college tuition and fees. When there are four eligible classes in college, the cost is expected to rise to $10 million to $12 million a year, say school administrators, or about half the cost of building a typical highway interchange. ''The Promise is changing how kids see their future,'' said Bob Jorth, 52, an industrial systems analyst and programmer who manages the program. His statistics break down the students who received the scholarship and enrolled in college this fall: 93 percent of eligible African-American girls; 84 percent of African-American boys; 88 percent of Hispanic girls; 82 percent of Hispanic boys; 90 percent of non-Hispanic white girls; and 90 percent of non-Hispanic white boys. 
 The figures show a large increase in those attending college. In 2005, for instance, 60 percent of African-American girls enrolled in college. 
 The students in the 2006 Promise class are attending 14 public colleges and universities in Michigan. There are 54 students at the University of Michigan and Michigan State University, the elite campuses. 
 Leonora Carter and Omarr Carter, both 30, moved from the Seattle area so they could enroll their five children, who range in age from 4 to 9, in Kalamazoo schools. The couple sold a four-bedroom home in Kent, Wash., for $323,000 and this month they are to close on a bigger home here that cost $199,000. Both the Carters have quickly found work.
 ''It's an adventure that's working out well,'' said Mrs. Carter, who is a nurse. ''The kids like school. Everything is so close. There's no traffic. A tank of gas lasts forever. The cost of living is much less. We didn't know anything about Michigan. But everybody here has been really warm and helpful.''
 Everyone seems to be involved. 
 ''The schools play a part in preparing students for college,'' said Ms. Miller-Adams. ''The community has to support students with tutoring and skills development so they can stay in school. Businesses have a role in hiring people that move to town to enroll their children in school. The university and the community college have a role in accepting students and encouraging them to graduate.''
 Such interlocking responsibilities are essential, community leaders say, in ensuring that the Promise performs as an economic development tool.
 ''We want to become known as a place where people can really achieve,'' said Mr. Kitchens of Southwest Michigan First, the development agency. ''We can educate our children in our good schools. We can send them to college with free tuition. They can go out and see the world. And when they turn 30, they can bring their families back. We want to be the city that says, and really means it, you can come home to good jobs and a great way of life.''

HEADLINE: True Blue Populists

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Senator George Allen of Virginia is understandably shocked and despondent. Just a year ago, a National Review cover story declared that his ''down-home persona'' made him ''quite possibly the next president of the United States.'' Instead, his political career seems over.
 And it wasn't just macaca, or even the war, that brought him down. Mr. Allen, a reliable defender of the interests of the economic elite, found himself facing an opponent who made a point of talking about the problem of rising inequality. And the tobacco-chewing, football-throwing, tax-cutting, Social Security-privatizing senator was only one of many faux populists defeated by real populists last Tuesday. 
Ever since movement conservatives took over, the Republican Party has pushed for policies that benefit a small minority of wealthy Americans at the expense of the great majority of voters. To hide this reality, conservatives have relied on wagging the dog and wedge issues, but they've also relied on a brilliant marketing campaign that portrays Democrats as elitists and Republicans as representatives of the average American. 
 This sleight of hand depends on shifting the focus from policy to personal style: John Kerry speaks French and windsurfs, so pay no attention to his plan to roll back tax cuts for the wealthy and use the proceeds to make health care affordable.
 This year, however, the American people wised up.
 True to form, some reporters still seem to be falling for the conservative spin. ''If it walks, talks like a conservative, can it be a Dem?'' asked the headline on a CNN.com story featuring a photo of Senator-elect Jon Tester of Montana. In other words, if a Democrat doesn't fit the right-wing caricature of a liberal, he must be a conservative.
 But as Robin Toner and Kate Zernike of The New York Times pointed out yesterday, what actually characterizes the new wave of Democrats is a ''strong streak of economic populism.'' 
 Look at Mr. Tester's actual policy positions: yes to an increase in the minimum wage; no to Social Security privatization; we need to ''stand up to big drug companies'' and have Medicare negotiate for lower prices; we should ''stand up to big insurance companies and support a health care plan that makes health care affordable for all Montanans.''
 So what, aside from his flattop haircut, makes Mr. Tester a conservative? O.K., he supports gun rights. But on economic issues he's clearly left of center, not just compared with the current Senate, but compared with current Democratic senators. The same can be said of many other victorious Democrats, including Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Sheldon Whitehouse in Rhode Island, and Sherrod Brown in Ohio. All of these candidates ran on unabashedly populist platforms, and won.
 What about Joe Lieberman? Like shipwreck survivors clinging to flotsam, some have seized on his reelection as proof of Americans' continuing conservatism. But Mr. Lieberman won only through denial and deception, for example, by rewriting the history of his once-fervent support for the Iraq war and Donald Rumsfeld. He got two-thirds of the Republican vote, but managed to confuse enough Democrats about his positions to get over the top.
 Last week's populist wave, among other things, vindicates the populist direction that Al Gore took in the closing months of the 2000 campaign. But will this wave be reflected in the actual direction of the Democratic Party? 
 Not necessarily. Quite a few sitting Democrats have shown themselves nearly as willing as Republicans to bow to corporate interests. Consider the vote on last year's draconian bankruptcy bill. Mr. Lieberman voted for cloture, cutting off debate and ensuring the bill's passage; then he voted against the bill, a meaningless gesture that let him have it both ways. Thirteen other Democratic senators also voted for cloture, including Joe Biden, who has just announced his candidacy for president. 
 The first big test of the new Democratic populism will come over reform of the 2003 prescription drug law. Democrats have pledged to repeal the clause in that law preventing Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices. But the fine print of how they do that is crucial: Medicare reform could be a mere symbolic gesture, or it could be a real reform that eliminates the huge implicit subsidies the program currently gives drug and insurance companies. 
 Are the newly invigorated Democrats ready to offer a real change in this country's direction? We'll know in a few months.

HEADLINE: Dubious Mix: Rich Suitors, Ailing Papers

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
Into a chaotic world of antsy shareholders fed up with declining margins and circulation, there is the thunder of hooves in the distance, a white knight coming over the hill with huge saddlebags of money to save the once-noble newspaper industry from certain doom.
 The Tribune Company, under pressure to sell and having received lukewarm offers from private equity investors, is now turning its attention to a Forbes list of wealthy potential buyers, including a combined bid from Eli Broad and Ronald W. Burkle -- or David Geffen perhaps, in a solo rescue of The Los Angeles Times. 
During the weekend came word that Tribune has also attracted Maurice R. Greenberg, the insurance tycoon, who is said to consider newspapers undervalued. Civic-minded businesspeople in Hartford, Baltimore and Boston have all suggested that they, too, would like to step into the breach created by seismic changes in the industry.
 We have seen this movie before, as recently as last spring. After The Philadelphia Inquirer ended up as an orphan in the McClatchy buyout of Knight Ridder, Brian P. Tierney, a Philadelphia businessman, led a consortium of investors to save a prized city asset. He promised that he and his partners would invest in good journalism, retain the paper's leadership and avoid job cuts. 
 Six months later, Mr. Tierney has pulled back on expenses. He dumped the publisher in the summer and the editor last week, and is now looking for 150 jobs to be trimmed from an already-reduced base of 425. 
 What had been billed as an epic Philly love story, with civic leaders reaching deep to turn things around, has turned into one more disaster movie. It is as if Mr. Tierney kicked the tires on an otherwise solid used vehicle with a few dents, paid a discounted price, and then found out that there were two squirrels under the hood when he pulled out of the lot. 
 Mr. Tierney neither manufactured nor created The Inquirer's travails: because advertising revenues industrywide went off a cliff starting in July and, as a result, net profits at the paper this year will most likely be half of their level two years ago. 
 The better newspapers continue to deliver cash flow, and in the case of the Tribune Company, a profit margin of 20 percent, but secular changes in the industry -- that whole darn Interwebnet thingie -- have not only wiped out growth; they are now eating into the advertising base. 
 Circulation, the other pedal the industry pushes on, has lost compression and then some. The Los Angeles Times has lost reputation and circulation -- 8 percent in just the last six months -- and last week, Dean Baquet, one of the industry's most esteemed editors, was sacrificed to the gods of cost control.
 So if newspapers in the hands of experienced operators are flailing -- the Tribune Company made huge amounts on newspapers before the paradigm shifted -- how is it that men who made money selling groceries, building houses or breaking pop music acts will suddenly crack the code? Even the storied operator Warren E. Buffet, whose Berkshire Hathaway has significant holdings in the Washington Post Company and Gannett, has not been able to buck the trend at The Buffalo News.
 ''All of the inherent growth has been squeezed out of the industry, which eliminates any number of potential buyers,'' said Edward Atorino, a media analyst with the Benchmark Company. ''Without classifieds, which are on the way out, and the flight of advertising to the Web, this is an industry that is going to be resized in a fundamental way.'' 
 Each potential buyer of the Tribune papers has said, mostly through surrogates, that profits are not the point, but men who spent their lives piling up money hate to watch it evaporate. And any experienced business reporter will tell you the average titan has little understanding or sympathy for aggressive newsgathering. 
 ''They say they are not interested in making money and they are not going to interfere in the editorial process, so what exactly is the deal here?'' said Edward Wasserman, a professor of journalism at Washington and Lee University.
 Winning a newspaper in a bidding war is a little like winning a lottery whose prize is to have a piano dropped on your head. You get the piano, but you won't be in much of a mood or condition to play it.
 ''I have never met a rich man who didn't think he knew how to run anything,'' said John Morton, a longtime newspaper analyst. ''But the newspaper business is in the midst of a very complicated time where they could lose a lot of money very quickly.''
 Mr. Morton and others say that quality newspaper brands with dominant positions in their local markets will eventually become good businesses again, but it will take the kind of patience that public markets lack and corporate titans rarely display. 
 ''There are enormous questions about the economic model,'' said David Abrahamson, a professor at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern. ''But you should never discount the attractions and seduction of cultural power. History will show that some people will do wonderful things with it, while others will turn into complete Visigoths who want their golfing buddies to get good coverage.''
 Even if they stay out of the news process, staring down lower margins and tough fundamentals can wear on even the most enlightened owner. 
 ''When I see this going on, I don't want to hoist a flag and salute,'' said David Nasaw, a professor of history at the City University of New York. ''Newspapers are a serious enterprise, not amateur hour, and say what you want about the old press barons, they were newspaper people and they understood the business and got their hands dirty.''
 When Mr. Tierney and his cohort bought The Inquirer, they were undoubtedly sincere in both their rhetoric and intentions. And perhaps they were suckered in by the conceit of many businesspeople -- that with a little common sense and some scratches on the back of an envelope, they could turn newspapers back into the A.T.M.'s they once were.
 That turned out to be a fairy tale. The trouble with white knights is that once they get knocked off their horses, they end up covered in the same mud that mere mortals slog through every day. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 16, 2006

 CORRECTION:
The Media Equation column in Business Day on Monday, about the interest of local investors in the newspaper industry, misstated the circumstances surrounding the departure of the publisher of The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Daily News about six months after those papers were acquired by local businessmen. The publisher, Joe Natoli, was asked to stay but chose to leave for a job at the University of Miami; he was not ''dumped'' by the new owners.

HEADLINE: As Sonics Pack to Leave Town, Seattle Shrugs

BYLINE: By JESSICA KOWAL

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
Empowered by a wave of venture capital, a hiring boom and pride in its homegrown billionaires, this city has decided it no longer needs a mediocre professional basketball team to feel good about itself. 
 On Election Day, residents rebuffed their once-beloved Seattle SuperSonics, voting overwhelmingly for a ballot measure ending public subsidies for professional sports teams.
The owners, who bought the Sonics in October for $350 million from Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks, had warned that the team would leave unless the city provided a new arena. 
 The vote delighted Citizens for More Important Things, a group that, with the help of a statewide health care union, spent $60,000 to sponsor the initiative. Other cities ''may be so desperate to lure tourists there that they have to overpay for an N.B.A. team,'' said Chris Van Dyk, a founder of the group. ''Seattle doesn't have to lure anybody.''
 Mr. Van Dyk's priorities are schools, transportation projects and health care, and he openly disdains wealthy people who buy professional teams, pay huge salaries to players and then demand handouts. Owners who threaten to take their teams elsewhere, Mr. Van Dyk said, are no better than ''the neighborhood crack cocaine dealer.'' 
 Told of Mr. Van Dyk's comments, Clayton I. Bennett of Oklahoma City, chairman of the group that owns the Sonics and the Seattle Storm of the W.N.B.A., sighed.
 Seattle ''turned its back on the N.B.A.,'' Mr. Bennett said in a telephone interview, and gave up its chance to build a ''multipurpose'' arena suitable for basketball, hockey and conventions. 
 ''I'm not saying it's the most important thing or the only thing, but I think professional sports are an important component to the overall economy and quality of life in any marketplace,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''It's about flying the flag of the city nationally and globally.''
 The vote last week guarantees that the Sonics will leave their current home, KeyArena, in 2010, he said. The team may move to the Seattle suburbs and plans to talk to the State Legislature about that in coming weeks, but most people here think Mr. Bennett and his partners will move the team to Oklahoma City. 
 Even without the Sonics, Seattle would still have professional baseball and football teams, the Mariners and the Seahawks.
 Antistadium sentiment was also reflected in Sacramento, where voters rejected a sales tax increase to pay for a new arena for the Kings, the basketball team there.
 Residents and elected officials here have gone back and forth on financing for sports facilities. In 1995, voters narrowly rejected a sales tax to finance a baseball stadium for the Mariners. But after the team had a record season, the Legislature decided that the public would pay for most of a new stadium, Safeco Field, which ultimately cost more than $500 million.
 In 1997, Paul Allen, a founder of Microsoft and one of the city's billionaires, sponsored a statewide campaign that persuaded voters to commit $300 million to replace the Kingdome for the Seahawks. In return, Mr. Allen bought the team and put $100 million into a new field. 
 Last season, the team went to the Super Bowl for the first time, and Mr. Allen credited boisterous fans for victories at Qwest Field.
 Owners of professional teams have long argued that arenas and stadiums increase economic development, jobs and tourism. With some economists challenging that view, the owners have developed a new argument: that a team enhances a city's social status, said David J. Olson, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Washington. 
 Seattle is not buying it.
 ''Citizens in Seattle look around and see Microsoft and Boeing doing fabulously, the Port of Seattle is booming and trade with China is going to define this city's existence for the next 50 years,'' Professor Olson said. ''Seattle has said, We can be a big-league city, we can be an international city, without kowtowing to professional sports franchises.''
 The Sonics were Seattle's first professional team and first love, especially after they won a National Basketball Association championship in 1979. But the team's record, aside from a playoff run in 2004, has been middling for years. 
 KeyArena, the smallest of any N.B.A. team, was renovated in 1995 with $75 million from taxpayers. 
 Public sentiment turned against the Sonics last winter when Mr. Schultz, the Starbucks chairman, demanded that the state provide $200 million to refurbish the city-owned arena. The team would have contributed $18 million.
 It did not help the Sonics that on the morning of last week's vote, a local newspaper heralded a deal to build a privately financed headquarters for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation near the Sonics' home. 
 The foundation, which gives billions of dollars to improve global health and public education, has paid $50 million for the land, will build three office buildings and will pay $1.7 million for traffic improvements. The city's main financial commitment is to build a $15.3 million parking garage, which it will own.
 To many Sonics fans, the rejection of sports financing proves that old, laid-back Seattle has been crushed by elitist, Prius-driving do-gooders. 
 To say there is ''no cultural value'' in the Sonics is ''ludicrous,'' said Paul Merrill, a 34-year-old stand-up comedian who was 7 when the Sonics won the championship. Yet even Mr. Merrill, who helps run Supersonicsoul, ''the Sonics blog for the Sonics people,'' finds it hard to justify public spending on a new arena, an attitude reflected in a joke he tells in his comedy routine.
 As a big basketball fan, Mr. Merrill says, he should come up with 200 million reasons why the city should pay for a $200 million arena: Where else can he buy a $7 pretzel? And, sure, that money could build housing for the homeless, but can homeless people dunk?
 The real punch line, Mr. Merrill said, is that even he can think of only seven ''reasons'' to keep the Sonics in Seattle.

HEADLINE: Administration Opposes Democrats' Plan for Negotiating Medicare Drug Prices 

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said on Sunday that it would strenuously oppose one of the Democrats' top priorities for the new Congress: legislation authorizing the government to negotiate with drug companies to secure lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries.
 In an interview, Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, said he saw no prospect of compromise on the issue. 
 ''In politics,'' Mr. Leavitt said, ''most specific issues like this are a disguise for a larger difference. Government negotiation of drug prices does not work unless you have a program completely run by the government. Democrats say they want the government to negotiate prices. What they really want is government-run health care.''
 Federal price negotiations would unravel the whole structure of the Medicare drug benefit, which relies on competing private plans, Mr. Leavitt said.
 Dozens of plans are available in every state. They charge different premiums and co-payments and cover different drugs. The 2003 Medicare law explicitly prohibits the federal government from negotiating drug prices or establishing a list of preferred drugs.
 Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who is in line to become the House speaker, has said the House will take up legislation to repeal that ban in its first 100 hours under Democratic control. Senate Democrats have expressed a similar desire. The eight Democrats newly elected to the Senate all say Medicare should have the power to negotiate with drug makers.
 ''The government negotiates big discounts for the prices of drugs for our veterans,'' said Senator-elect Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. ''But the drug companies got Congress to make it illegal to negotiate for lower prices under Medicare.'' 
 Secretary Leavitt said he did not want the power to negotiate drug prices. ''I don't believe I can do a better job than an efficient market,'' he said.
 ''We are seeing large-scale negotiations with drug manufacturers, but they are conducted by private drug plans, not by the government,'' Mr. Leavitt said. ''A robust marketplace with a lot of competitors has driven down prices. It's the magic of the market. To assume that the government, in our genius, could improve on this belies the reality of a complex task.''
 If a bill allowing negotiations got through Congress, it could face a presidential veto, depending on its details. Appearing on ''Fox News Sunday,'' Dan Bartlett, counselor to the president, said competing private plans had already brought down costs more than government price controls would have.
 Democrats have not specified exactly how Medicare would negotiate with drug companies. 
 Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the assistant Democratic leader, has introduced a bill that instructs the secretary of health and human services to offer and operate one or more Medicare drug plans, in addition to those already available. The bill requires the secretary to negotiate prices with the manufacturers of drugs covered by the government-run plans. Ms. Pelosi is a co-sponsor of a similar bill.
 At a news conference last week, President Bush said he wanted to work with the new Democratic majority in Congress. ''I believe on a lot of issues we can find common ground,'' he said.
 In December 2005, just before leaving office, Mr. Leavitt's predecessor, Tommy G. Thompson, said he wished Congress had given him the authority to negotiate prices for Medicare beneficiaries, as he negotiated discounts on antibiotics during the anthrax scare of 2001.
 Health plans and pharmacy benefit managers use many tools to drive down drug prices. In effect, ''you play one manufacturer off against another,'' said James R. Lang, former president of Anthem Prescription Management, which administered drug benefits for five million people.
 Insurers obtain discounts in return for increasing the use of a particular drug, and they can get bigger discounts by threatening to shift patients to a similar product made by a competing drug company, Mr. Lang said.
 The approach that Mr. Leavitt described as unacceptable is already used in other government programs. Under federal law, drug makers must provide a discount, or rebate, equal to at least 15 percent of the average manufacturer price for most brand-name drugs covered by Medicaid, the program for low-income people. Federal law also guarantees discounts for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which negotiates with drug makers to secure discounts on top of those guaranteed by law.
 Mr. Leavitt said the veterans program was not a good model for Medicare. The V.A., he said, has its own drug-distribution system and its own pharmacies and limits drug choices more than Medicare does.
 Drug companies and some economists worry that if the government offered its own Medicare drug plan, it might insist on the ''best price'' offered to any private-sector purchaser of a particular medication. Medicare officials could then try to negotiate deeper discounts. But to do so, a government-run Medicare plan would probably have to establish its own list of preferred drugs, known as a formulary.
 ''For this to work,'' Mr. Lang said, ''the government would have to take over price negotiations. It would have to take over formularies. You can't do one without the other. Drug manufacturers won't give up something for nothing. They will want a preferred position on the Medicare formulary -- some way to increase the market share for their products.''
 Democrats said they were not seeking price controls or a uniform list of preferred drugs. ''This is just good old-fashioned free market economics,'' Mr. Durbin said. ''If one buys in bulk, the price goes down.''
 One potential obstacle to swift action is that some lawmakers, including Democrats, may want to hold hearings. Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat poised to become chairman of the Finance Committee, voted in March against a proposal authorizing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Aides said that he wanted to give the program more time to work, but that he was willing to consider such proposals.

HEADLINE: Two Democrats Struggle As Georgia Bucks a Trend

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN; Brenda Goodman contributed reporting from Atlanta.

DATELINE: MACON, Ga., Nov. 10 

 BODY:
Politically speaking, Georgia proved to be a mirror image of the rest of the country in the midterm elections. Republicans swept nearly every statewide office, and turnout among Democrats was low, thanks to a lackluster candidate for governor.
 But two Democratic congressmen in highly competitive races in the state seem to have successfully fought those odds, though they are hanging on by the slenderest of margins and are still waiting for their opponents to concede.
 The two Democrats, Jim Marshall of Macon, in the Eighth Congressional District, and John Barrow of Savannah, in the 12th District, were on the Republican Party's short list of beatable incumbents. Their adjoining districts, which encompass large rural areas, were redrawn by a Republican legislature, their opponents were former congressmen, and the National Republican Congressional Committee poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into the races. President Bush campaigned in each district twice. 
 ''It is a year that if you look at Georgia compared to the rest of the nation, there's a real counterprevailing trend,'' said J. Christopher Grant, a political science professor at Mercer University in Macon, ''and it is actually amazing that these folks were able to hang on.'' Mr. Marshall squeaked by with a lead of 2,040 votes in a district on the home turf of two of Georgia's most prominent Republicans, Gov. Sonny Perdue and Senator Saxby Chambliss.
 Mr. Barrow, whose race was so close it is one of eight in the House that have not been called by The Associated Press, led by 963 votes. (The other seven races involve Republican incumbents.) The results have not been certified, and a spokesman for Mr. Barrow's opponent, Max Burns, said enough ballots remained uncounted that he could pull ahead. If Mr. Barrow should lose, he would be the only Congressional Democrat ousted by a Republican this year. 
 As the state's only white Democrats in Congress, both men relied on incumbency and their relatively conservative records, while also focusing on getting voters, especially blacks, to the polls. Mr. Marshall doubled the amount of money he planned to spend, to nearly $2 million. Mr. Barrow's campaign emphasized his independence, portraying him as willing to break with the Democratic party line. 
 Erick Erickson, a Republican political consultant, lawyer and blogger in Macon, said Mr. Barrow had been more vulnerable than Mr. Marshall. Mr. Barrow is a freshman whose liberal base in Athens was shifted away in the redistricting. Mr. Marshall, a former mayor of Macon, is in his second term and was familiar to his new constituents because they were in the Macon media market and therefore had frequently seen him on television. While the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent more than $500,000 to help retain Mr. Barrow's seat, it spent less than $100,000 in Mr. Marshall's race.
 While an outsider looking at raw numbers would probably assume that Mr. Marshall could be picked off, said Mr. Erickson, the chief executive of the Redstate blog, ''if you actually know something about the district, you come to the conclusion that he would be hard to beat.''
 Mr. Marshall is popular and moderate, and several voters interviewed mentioned his constituent services and accessibility. He is a Vietnam veteran who has repeatedly visited the troops in Iraq and courted the large military presence in the district, and, Mr. Grant said, votes the way his constituents would want him to even if his personal views are more liberal.
 But the Marshall race turned out to be no less competitive. ''When Bush came back the second time, that was a signal to me that they had tracking numbers that were showing the gap closing,'' said State Senator Robert Brown, a Macon Democrat who led a get-out-the-vote drive that focused on blacks who voted infrequently.
 In both districts, Republicans tried to link the incumbents with controversial figures like Representative Cynthia A. McKinney, a Democrat who lost in the August primary, and paint them as likely to raise taxes and grant amnesty to illegal immigrants. At the same time, the incumbents were hamstrung, unable to bring in Democrats with national name recognition because of their unpopularity in a part of the country where President Bush is well liked.
 The National Republican Congressional Committee spent more than a half-million dollars in each race, and the Economic Freedom Fund, an independent group financed by Bob J. Perry, the Texas homebuilder who bankrolled the Swift boat veterans' attacks against Senator John Kerry in the 2004 presidential campaign, bought advertising as well. Mr. Marshall's campaign estimated that he was the target of more negative advertisements than any other candidate in the country.
 ''The principal thing is that voters in middle Georgia and south Georgia have a pretty clear perception of who I am and what I stand for,'' Mr. Marshall said over breakfast at Nu-Way Wieners in Macon on Friday. ''And that perception wasn't undone, at least not altogether undone, by the campaign of my opponents.''
 But, he said, his Republican challenger, Mac Collins, ''had a staff that was willing to say virtually anything, utterly untroubled by fact and truth, a total end-justifies-the-means mentality.''
 A spokesman for Mr. Collins, Bill Hagan, said the campaign would not comment until the results were certified.
 At Jeneane's Cafe in Macon, two Republican women neatly illustrated the nuances voters sifted through on their way to the polls. 
 One, Sally McLemore, ticked off a list of Mr. Marshall's good deeds: support for Robins Air Force Base, farmers and rural health care. But, Ms. McLemore said, she voted for Mr. Collins.
 ''I was thinking national level, and we're clearly in a crisis and we need to stick with the Republicans,'' she said. ''I don't want to see Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House; I think it's dangerous.''
 She added that she was happy Mr. Marshall was a conservative Democrat. ''Now that it's all over and done with, I'm delighted he's there because I think he's a voice of wisdom.''
 The reasoning of Ms. McLemore's friend, Peggy Steele, ran the other direction. She voted for Mr. Marshall. ''I was counting on the other Republicans to worry about the national,'' Ms. Steele said, ''and I was worrying about the local.''
 But other voters said the national climate had worked in Mr. Marshall's favor. At the Fresh Air Bar-B-Que in Butts County, in the new part of the Eighth District, the owner, George Barber, supported Mr. Collins, who grew up down the road. 
 ''Politics is certainly a fickle thing,'' said Mr. Barber, who owns the business with his brother. ''Had it been two weeks earlier or two weeks later, it might have had a different outcome.''

HEADLINE: So Many Causes, So Little Time for the Hollywood Do-Gooder

BYLINE: By SHARON WAXMAN

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
ON a clear October night along the Sin City strip, NBC Universal's chairman, Bob Wright, gathered friends and supporters to raise $1 million for Autism Speaks, the charity he helped found with his wife, Suzanne. It was a high-profile event in the season of high-flying Hollywood giving. 
 For Hollywood, October had already been a brutal month: on the 5th came the Millennium Ball to raise money for U.C.L.A. On the 8th, a doubleheader -- dinner for the Rape Foundation and an event for the Special Olympics. The American Cinematheque had its blowout fund-raiser on Oct. 13, and three days later the Fulfillment Fund, which helps poor students finish their educations, held its shindig.
 The month was not half over yet. Hollywood dignitaries heading up the Autism Speaks benefit committee at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino here included the DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife, Marilyn; the movie stars Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas; and Yahoo's chairman, Terry S. Semel, and his wife, Jane. 
 But almost none of those luminaries actually attended -- not even NBC Universal Television Group's chief executive, Jeff Zucker, and Mr. Wright is his boss. They skipped the stand-up stylings of the NBC star Jay Leno and the emcee gravitas of the former NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw for writing a check. 
 ''It's really hard to decide where to go,'' said Ron Meyer, the president of Universal Studios, who came from Los Angeles with his wife, Kelly, but was sympathetic to his colleagues who did not attend. ''Most of us get three to four legitimate invitations a week, and it's impossible to be physically at all of them.'' 
 Mr. Meyer said that he came because he was moved by the Wrights' commitment to their cause; the power couple started the group after learning that their grandchild was autistic. But even Mr. Meyer has had to make choices. His studio gave up its annual sponsorship of TreePeople, a Los Angeles organization that plants trees around the city. 
 Nonprofit activists know why. ''For a lot of people, there's philanthropic burnout,'' said Andy Lipkis, the founder of TreePeople, speaking to a reporter at his annual fund-raiser at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, the night after the autism event. Waiters circulated with trays of white wine around a ''green carpet,'' and an auction table included vintage T-shirts and a guided tour of the Griffith Park Observatory. 
 ''It's always a challenge,'' Mr. Lipkis continued. ''People are feeling pulled on.'' 
 Hollywood has always had seasons of overbooked charity dinners, but as the merry-go-round spins from September to the end of this year, bone-weary fatigue has set in early. Another evening, another honoree. Another tux. Another sea bass with lemon grass. One worthy cause nudges another aside. And in the small circle of solicitors and givers, there is a desire to find a different approach. 
 As one studio mogul put it: ''I tell them: 'I'll write a check, but I'm not coming.' ''
 Actor-activists, asked constantly to come to public events, also acknowledged that they had scaled back their appearances. ''I've had to let go a lot of efforts that I certainly believe in, like the Environmental Media Group,'' said Peter Horton, the producer and ''Thirtysomething'' actor who was being honored at the TreePeople event. ''I just really felt I wanted to focus my efforts on a direct approach.'' 
 In a world where Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are changing philanthropy with megagifts and superambitious goals, it is only natural that Hollywood power players are starting to squirm in their swagged chairs, prisoners of the charity ball-and-chain. 
 ''The good news about the banquet circuit is that some hundreds of millions are raised for worthy causes each year,'' wrote the Variety editor Peter Bart in a column calling for an end to it all -- the dinners, trumped-up humanitarian awards, endless speeches. ''The bad news is that it's unrelenting, ferociously competitive and intensely political.''
 Some say that the current model is on its way to oblivion, like 2-D animation and dial-up Internet service. Many others have appealed for temporary relief. ''Once a year it would be great if Hollywood had one big megabanquet in which everyone could pick a special cause rather than the disease du jour,'' Mr. Bart wrote half-jokingly. 
 The problem is, ''one rubber chicken dinner leads to more rubber chicken dinners, and the recycling of money,'' said Bobby Shriver, a former music producer who now spends most of his time on charity work with his globe-hopping rock-star friend Bono. ''The relationship is: I ask you for $100, and in six months you ask me for $100. The leverage in there is very, very small. You work very, very hard for that $300,000.''
 Which is pretty much the amount that Mr. Lipkis hoped to make after his Beverly Wilshire evening, with a major chunk deducted for expenses. (The parade of charity events also persists because it supports the local hotel and catering economy.) 
 Mr. Shriver thinks that the ambitious goals of people like Mr. Gates, who is trying to eradicate certain illnesses, are trickling down. ''The thing Gates may have done is make hard issues seem cool,'' he said. '' 'Build a concert hall? No, I'm going to do river blindness.' People go: 'Let's look into that. Maybe I'll do waterborne diphtheria.' ''
 There is also movement the other way: adopting microcauses. At the United Talent Agency in Hollywood, for example, agents leapt at the chance to participate in an alternative to the banquet circuit. Last year, they began mentoring students from University High School in West Los Angeles, teaching teenagers there interviewing skills and financing school projects that were proposed by the students. An agency client, the actor Owen Wilson, was principal for a day, and the school is being used as a location in a film starring Mr. Wilson, which led to a school face-lift paid for by the movie production. 
 ''Writing a check and showing up to a dinner is a very honorable thing, but it's not the way agents really want to be involved,'' said Chris Day, a spokesman for the United Talent Agency. ''We knew if we set up a roll-up-your-sleeves program, they would jump in.'' 
 Still, however fatigued Hollywood insiders may be, many say they have few options. 
 Meanwhile, there will be more hors d'oeuvres where the last tray came from. ''There's a lot of pain in this world, and people need a lot of help,'' said Mr. Lipkis, who started his group as a teenager in his parent's home. ''The need is very much there.''

HEADLINE: Paul Hewson, Trying to Throw His Arms Around the World

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.; James Freed contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
PRECISELY 22 years ago this month, on the occasion of ''the Irish band U2'' playing a sold-out show at Radio City Music Hall in New York, the band's lead singer, 24 years old at the time, stopped to chat with a critic from The New York Times.
 Paul (Bono Vox) Hewson, as the article called him, was trying to explain that although the proceeds from the show were being donated to Amnesty International, he shunned ''the condescending thing of being a singer-prophet leading the mass.'' 
''I think that's a misuse of the stage,'' Mr. Hewson said. ''How can you be the spokesman for a generation if you've got nothing to say other than 'Help!'''
 That mixture of passion and self-contradiction might have been telling. Bono's rock stardom -- cemented a year later with U2's appearance at Live Aid, the epic exercise in rock 'n' roll fund-raising -- has been eclipsed by the very empire of advocacy organizations he helped create to do, he now says, what simple fund-raising never could. As a co-founder or principal in a collection of nonprofit, commercial or hybrid entities aimed at tackling poverty, AIDS and debt relief primarily in Africa, and by making expedient alliances -- with corporate players like Gap and Armani, or with conservative politicians like Jesse Helms -- Bono has become the face of fusion philanthropy.
 There's a method to the mission. The four pillars of the Bono activism conglomerate -- the lobbying groups DATA and ONE, the clothing line EDUN and, most recently, the (Product) RED brands -- are meant to tweak and motivate change at different levels of the developed world's social, economic and political systems. That way, barriers to advancement in poor countries can be removed.
 The model has earned him high praise. He has been a Nobel Prize nominee. He was one of Time magazine's Persons of the Year, along with Bill and Melinda Gates. His supporters even lobbied -- unrealistically -- to have him installed as president of the World Bank.
 Throw in the rise of the ''U2charist,'' in which some Episcopalian congregations have taken to celebrating the liturgy by using U2's music and what some consider its message of ''global reconciliation, justice for the poor and oppressed, and the importance of caring for your neighbor'' (snipurl.com/U2charist), and the canonization of Paul Hewson appears complete.
 That kind of beneficent overexposure, of course, is bound to draw exasperation. Exhibit one: the appearance in March of the Web site Eliminatebono.com, home of GONE: The Campaign to Make Bono History, an impudent retort to the singer's project ONE: The Campaign to Make Poverty History (one.org).
 But not every complaint is pure sour grapes.
 Labor groups were quick to point out, for example, that Gap -- a key partner in Bono's (Product) RED campaign, which drafts corporate sponsors to contribute profits on RED products to fight disease in Africa -- has a reputation for running sweatshops in developing countries.
 (Product) RED and Gap representatives have countered that the clothing company has made strides in cleaning up its act, and that the factories manufacturing clothes for (Product) RED were not sweatshops. But Charles Kernaghan, the director of the National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights, said he was not convinced.
 ''Bono cannot be so naive to think that the conditions in the factories he tours remain the same when he isn't there,'' Mr. Kernaghan said.
 Other groups have raised questions about the ability to access and inspect the factories that generate EDUN's own fair-trade clothing line, even though the company has been vetted by Verite, a nonprofit auditor. And investments by Bono's private equity firm, Elevation Partners, in video game titles like ''Mercenaries 2: World in Flames'' and ''Destroy All Humans'' have resulted in complaints that the rock star is singing from both sides of his mouth.
 Bono reflected on his humanitarian efforts -- and on the complaints -- in a call this month from Brisbane, Australia, where, as it happened, a small group of international activists was planning to demonstrate at U2's concerts because, they said, ''Mercenaries 2'' simulates violent military action in Venezuela.
 ''I have to tell you, the things that come up when you're in this band,'' Bono said. ''I mean, some of it of course is real and substantial -- and people have genuine fears and concerns. But some of it is just barking mad. 
 ''I've come to a place where I realize that there is something obnoxious about a spoiled rotten rock star in a photograph with a vulnerable child taken by a dreadful disease. But that's who I am and that's who they are. And I'm doing my best.''

The singer also reached out to Bobby Shriver, the well-connected venture capitalist and son of Sargent and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, with the aim of forming what is, at its core, a well-heeled lobby, with access to the corridors of power in the United States, Britain and throughout the G8, representing Africa's better interests.GREATEST HITS Helped last year to convince the G8 to begin providing an additional $25 billion in annual resources for sub-Saharan Africa by 2010.

HEADLINE: Arrest in Case Of White Powder And Threat Mail

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 12 

 BODY:
A man was arrested and charged with mailing threatening letters laced with white powder to Representative Nancy Pelosi, David Letterman and other prominent people, the F.B.I. said Sunday. 
 Officials took the man, Chad Conrad Castagana, 39, into custody on Saturday on charges of conveying false information and sending threats via the mail, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said. Mr. Castagana, of Los Angeles, was being held in a federal detention center pending a court appearance on Monday.
Investigators said that in addition to mailing letters to Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Letterman, Mr. Castagana sent them to Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York; Jon Stewart, host of the ''The Daily Show'' on Comedy Central; and the MSNBC host Keith Olbermann. Some of them included phrases like ''death to demagogues'' and pictures of victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami, the authorities said. Preliminary tests showed that the powder was not hazardous.
 The authorities said they watched Mr. Castagana, who is unemployed, walk from his home to a mailbox on Thursday and deposit several letters.

HEADLINE: New Tests, New Future For Doctors

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
Gastroenterologists are worried about their future. 
 The problem, as some of them see it, is that they have become so dependent on using colonoscopy to screen for cancer that many do little else. But the advent of new methods of detecting colon cancer could shove them out of the screening business.
 If that happens, what will gastroenterologists do? A committee of the American Gastroenterological Association says it is time to think about this possibility. 
 It would not be the first time that the profession has had to change. 
 A decade or so ago, gastroenterologists spent much of their time putting scopes down patients' throats and into their stomachs to look for ulcers. But over the last 20 years, for reasons that are not entirely clear, Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium that causes most ulcers, began to disappear in this country. Patients with chronic ulcers became less and less common. 
 Asked how much chronic ulcers have diminished in incidence, Dr. Robert S. Sandler, chief of the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of North Carolina, replied, ''I can't give you a statistic, but a lot.''
 But by chance, as endoscopies waned, a new test surged. This time, the focus was on the other end of the intestinal tract, the colon. By the late 1990s, people over age 50 were reporting to their doctors for screening colonoscopies, in which a gastroenterologist would thread a scope into the colon to look for cancer or for polyps, which can turn into cancer. 
 Medical groups recommended colon cancer screening. In 2001, Medicare said it would pay for the tests. And suddenly, gastroenterologists were doing colonoscopies almost full time. 
 The number of colonoscopies among Medicare recipients increased by 42 percent from 2000, when Medicare would pay only if patients were likely to have polyps or cancer, to 2002, when Medicare agreed to pay for colonoscopies as a screening test.
 In 2000, Medicare paid for 2,211,925 colonoscopies; by 2002 the figure had risen to 3,150,738. Soon, demand was so great that no matter how many colonoscopies doctors did, there were long lines of patients waiting to be screened. 
 Those who needed to see gastroenterologists for other reasons often had long waits for appointments, said Dr. Douglas Rex, a gastroenterologist and professor of medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine. 
 Gastroenterologists enjoy doing colonoscopies and believe they are important, because colon cancer is the most preventable cancer, Dr. Rex said. And, he added, there is a financial disincentive for treating patients with diseases like hepatitis or conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, which often require extensive, and poorly compensated, discussions with patients to help them cope. 
 Now, though, the colonoscopy era may be coming to an end, the gastroenterology association's Future Trends Committee said. The panel predicted that before long, most colon cancer screening could be done by radiologists with CT scans or even by general practitioners who send stool samples off for tests looking for cancer cells. Or patients may swallow a pill containing a camera that will show images of the colon, a method that is being tested now in the upper gastrointestinal tract. 
 So far, Medicare and other insurers do not generally pay for the CT scans to screen the colon, but that is expected to change as the technology improves. 
 With a CT scan, as with colonoscopies, patients have to take powerful laxatives ahead of time to cleanse their bowels. But for the actual test, they simply lie down and hold their breath for about 10 seconds, exhale, then hold their breath again while a scanner X-rays their colons, creating detailed, three-dimensional images. 
 With traditional colonoscopy, patients are sedated while a doctor threads a long tube into the colon. It takes about half an hour to examine the colon's walls. Then the patients wait in a recovery room for about an hour as the sedative wears off.
 Of course, if CT scans or other screening methods replace colonoscopy, the very nature of gastroenterologists' practice will be altered, said Dr. Timothy Cragin Wang, chief of the division of digestive and liver diseases at Columbia University Medical Center and the chairman of the gastroenterological association's committee. And, he added, ''obviously it has economic consequences.''
 ''Things change very quickly,'' Dr. Wang said. ''Dependence of a specialty on a single procedure is always a concern.''
 His committee suggested that gastroenterologists think about what else they might do. Maybe obesity treatment, the group said, or perhaps more of a focus on liver disease or actually treating colon cancer instead of just finding it.
 Or maybe gastroenterologists will not have to cede CT screening to radiologists after all. Why couldn't a gastroenterologist read a CT scan of the colon? If that is the direction they want to go, gastroenterologists can look to cardiologists for inspiration, Dr. Wang added.
 In cardiology, when angiograms were developed to look at the heart, cardiologists invented a new subspecialty to do those tests themselves. They could have let radiologists take over angiography, but they didn't.
 Now these interventional cardiologists are expanding, going beyond the heart to blood vessels all over the body, putting stents into carotid arteries that feed the brain and into blocked blood vessels in the legs.
 ''There are big political battles between the medical societies over who controls imaging,'' Dr. Wang said. ''Gastroenterologists should be involved in making the decisions on which tests should be done. They should be aware of the technology and how to use it in order to ensure that patients get the best possible care.''
 As the battle over colon cancer screening gets going, Dr. Wang said, ''I would certainly use cardiology as an example.''
 Not everyone would agree that the colonoscopy era is coming to an end. Those CT scans, sometimes called virtual colonoscopies, are not necessarily going to replace most traditional colonoscopies, some skeptics say, and if a CT scan or one of the more futuristic tests does find a polyp, the patient will still need a colonoscopy to take it out.
 ''Dire warnings never happen,'' said Dr. James T. Frakes, a gastroenterologist in Rockford, Ill., and past president of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. ''I think it always makes sense to look forward, but physicians, just by nature, are worriers. They can get so wrapped up in the worry that it paralyzes them.''
 And even if the demand for colonoscopies starts to slacken, Dr. Rex said, gastroenterologists still have plenty of alternatives.
 ''We have a lot of organs,'' Dr. Rex said. ''The esophagus, the stomach, the small bowel, the liver, the pancreas. I think we've got a lot to do.''
 Gastroenterologists, he added, ''will still be able to make a comfortable living.''

HEADLINE: Opponents of City Subsidies Fret Over Deal With MetLife

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration faced a dilemma: Metropolitan Life was reneging on a five-year-old deal under which it had agreed to move 1,700 employees to Long Island City, Queens, and stay there until 2021, rather than relocate them to Jersey City. In exchange, the insurance company had received millions of dollars in tax breaks.
 Now, the company was planning to move much of its operation to Midtown Manhattan. Under the terms of the 2001 deal, the Bloomberg administration could have penalized MetLife $24 million, or double the tax break it has received. But instead, the administration chose to fine the insurer $5 million and obtain another promise that it will retain at least 1,750 employees in New York City until 2026. 
The decision, which goes to the Industrial Development Agency today for approval, has surfaced at a time when New York appears on the verge of a new round of corporate poker with financial institutions, including Merrill Lynch, and other corporations threatening to move to New Jersey unless they get tax breaks and other incentives. 
 Those opposed to such corporate subsidies assert that the city's decision on MetLife amounts to a slap on the wrist and calls into question the very logic of providing tax breaks to corporations making location decisions. 
 ''Corporate retention deals haven't produced the jobs they promise,'' said Bettina Damiani of Good Jobs New York, a group that promotes policies that hold government officials and corporations accountable to taxpayers. 
 But Josh Serifman, acting president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said yesterday that the outcome of MetLife's expected move is more beneficial to the city than the original deal because the insurer was promising to keep 30 percent of its employees in Long Island City through 2014 and no fewer than 1,750 jobs in New York City until 2026. 
 MetLife, which says the company wants to be back in the corporate mainstream in Midtown because the neighborhood has evolved, will not get any new tax breaks for its move across the East River. It will move about 1,280 of its 1,834 employees to far more expensive space in a skyscraper overlooking Bryant Park on Avenue of the Americas at 42nd Street, where annual rents are more than $80 per square foot, or three times what MetLife is paying in Queens.
 The company expects to close this week on the largest real estate deal in American history with the $5.4 billion sale of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village.
 The city could face many more negotiations over tax breaks in the coming months. Lehman Brothers, Viacom, Disney and Ogilvy & Mather, which have leases that will expire in the next few years, are all looking for large blocks of prime office space in Manhattan, where vacant space has become increasingly expensive and hard to find. The companies routinely look at sites on both sides of the Hudson River and then bargain with New York City and New Jersey for the best deal.
 Merrill Lynch, one of the largest employers in Lower Manhattan, has now formally joined the fray, with company officials and its brokers at Jones Lang LaSalle saying that the investment bank is looking at all its options, including New Jersey. Merrill's lease at the World Financial Center expires in 2013.
 Opponents of such subsidies say they are worried that history will repeat itself.
 In 1997, the city and the state provided Merrill with a combined $28.6 million in tax breaks and grants after the company threatened to move almost 3,900 employees to Jersey City. Rather than growing, Merrill's city workforce, like MetLife's, has declined.
 More recently, real estate brokers say that Merrill and other investment banks want to duplicate both the technology and the government subsidies that Goldman Sachs recently got to build a new headquarters near the World Financial Center. State and city officials agreed to provide Goldman Sachs with $1.65 billion in tax-free bonds last year and more than $115 million in tax breaks, cash grants and other incentives.
 In response to news reports that Merrill might be bargaining for subsidies, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said on Sunday that he would not give the company a special deal. ''I think what we should do is use the money to make New York a place that companies' employees want to live and work,'' he said, ''and that will get them to stay.''
 The mayor added, ''It's a much more powerful draw and anchor for them than any subsidy.'' 
 But Mr. Bloomberg left open the door for Merrill Lynch to obtain the kind of incentives that the city routinely offers to any other company.
 ''If the city opens its wallet to Merrill Lynch again,'' said Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban Future, ''it would potentially open the door for a whole list of financial and media companies to come back to the city for a second helping of tax breaks.''
 Noting the mayor's stand on Merrill Lynch, some landlords in the city's diamond district yesterday asked him to look at another matter before the Industrial Development Agency today: a proposal to give up to $37 million in tax breaks to a developer planning to build a 40-story tower for the diamond industry on 47th Street, west of Fifth Avenue.
 The MetLife deal dates to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration and is not unlike the deal that Merrill already has. After the insurer threatened a move to New Jersey in 2001, the city gave the company an incentive package worth $26.4 million to move senior management and most of its employees to a former auto factory in Long Island City.
 City Councilman Eric N. Gioia, who represents Long Island City, is unconvinced that such packages are good public policy.
 ''An ad hoc economic development policy of giving tax breaks to corporations that threaten to leave the city doesn't work,'' he said. ''This is the result.''

HEADLINE: Loading an Airliner Is Rocket Science

BYLINE: By PAUL BURNHAM FINNEY

 BODY:
Airlines have been boarding passengers for decades, long enough, it would seem, to have figured out the best way to get people on and off a plane. But they haven't.
 Spurred by financial pressures and packed planes -- often 80 to 90 percent full -- airlines have come up with a wide variation of boarding techniques, from the simple back-to-front protocol to one of the most complicated strategies, known as the reverse pyramid system, that US Airways has adopted. In September, JetBlue told customers they could be seated first if they booked Rows 20 to 26, the very back of the plane.
 Minimizing time on the ground, especially on shorter flights that use single-aisle aircraft, means the planes can get back in the air faster so they can make money. Even a few extra minutes on the ground can throw off the day's schedule.
 ''The advantage of a fast turnaround is not cutting costs but generating revenue,'' said David Swierenga, an economist and president of AeroEcon, an aviation consultancy. ''If you save time with each turn of, say, seven flights, you may be able to schedule an eighth flight.'' 
 Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group, an aviation industry consultant, said the time savings on transcontinental flights do not make much difference. ''But if it's Baltimore to Islip on Long Island, it matters.'' 
 The basic back-to-front procedure is probably the most familiar, and it is still used by many airlines, including Air Canada, Alaska, American, British Airways, Continental, Frontier, Midwest, Spirit and Virgin Atlantic. (Nearly all airlines allow first-class or business-class passengers, and those with special needs, to board first.) 
 Mathematicians would revel in the intricacies of the new boarding techniques. There is the outside-in technique, nicknamed Wilma, for window first, then middle and then aisle, a technique favored by Delta and United. And there is the sort of nonsystem system pioneered by Southwest Airlines in which passengers board in the order they arrive, with no assigned seats.
 Among the reformers, US Airways can lay claim to one of the most complex procedures. It is basically Wilma, with seats filled in a pattern as intricate as a microchip's circuitry: rear window and middle first, front window and middle next, followed by rear aisle, then front aisle. The airline calls it the reverse pyramid system, but it might be better described as a V-shaped sequence that operates by zones. 
 US Airways inherited that system from its newly merged partner, America West, which devised it back in 2002 with the help of an industrial engineering team at Arizona State University. Aided by photos taken at Los Angeles International Airport, the researchers created mathematical models and simulations using ''pixels as people,'' as a team member, Menkes van den Briel, puts it.
 US Airways now uses the procedure on about half of its Airbus A320 and Boeing 757 jets and plans to finish the conversion next year. The goal, as the Arizona State team's report defines it, is ''to minimize the total expected number of seat and aisle interferences.'' So far, the system has cut US Airways' turnaround time by two to five minutes, said a spokeswoman, Valerie Wunder.
 AirTran Airways, a discount carrier, uses a simpler variation. ''We divide the plane into six different sections in a rotating zone system,'' a spokeswoman, Judy Graham-Weaver, said. Business class fills up first, along with special-needs passengers. Then the airline begins the seating sequence with the back five rows called first, the front five behind business class second, the next back five rows third -- continuing until the rows meet in the middle.
 What is the advantage? One zone is stowing bags while the next zone some distance away is getting settled -- and the zones tend not to interfere with one another, Ms. Graham-Weaver said.
 The variable that keeps upsetting the airline industry's careful planning is the unpredictability of human behavior. The industry calls it ''interference,'' and it means time-killing activities like elderly passengers perching on armrests to stuff a bag into the overhead bin.
 ''The unexpected behavior of passengers can lead you to chaos theory for an explanation,'' Mr. Aboulafia said. ''That's when random events set off a sequence of unpredictable actions and your best-laid plans go out the window.'' But some boarding experts note that people have an innate capacity to ''self-organize'' and keep out of each other's way.
 Because behavior is so hard to predict, some argue that changing boarding procedures is less effective than other tactics, like limiting carry-on baggage. 
 ''To simplify and improve boarding, the only way is to limit the amount of carry-on baggage,'' said Patricia A. Friend, president of the Association of Flight Attendants. ''As long as people hold up the boarding process -- stowing as much as they can get away with -- it's going to be slow boarding and even slower deplaning.''
 The recent security crackdown that tightened limits on carry-on luggage serendipitously proved her point. Some airlines said boarding had become noticeably easier because many carry-ons ended up as checked baggage.
 Perhaps the simplest approach is the open seating plan famously practiced by Southwest Airlines since its earliest days in 1971. It may seem slightly quaint next to its more elaborate cousins, but it has helped make Southwest a turnaround champion that claims to take only 25 minutes on average to unload, clean and reload its 137-passenger Boeing 737s.
 ''That's very fast,'' said Mr. Swierenga, the consultant, adding that there are no industry benchmarks on turnaround time. ''It depends on the size of the aircraft,'' he said. ''A 747 jumbo can take hours.''
 Southwest's turnaround time is ''below those of our competitors,'' said a Southwest spokeswoman, Beth Harbin, who added that the range is 35 minutes to an hour for most airlines.
 Southwest's system is also cheap and uncomplicated, requiring almost no exotic technology. Customers get assigned to Groups A, B or C on their boarding passes, in the order in which the passenger checks in. Groups are called in alphabetical order, with passengers rushing to occupy the seat of their choice.
 Though some Southwest passengers liken it to a cattle car, they are generally good sports. But in blogs and other forums they grouse that they have to be at the airport early to get the best seats.
 To show off the effectiveness of its simple system, Southwest's scheduling department has come up with a what-if model, in which turnarounds take five minutes longer. To keep its current schedules of 2,773 daily turns for its fleet of 461 737s, the airline would need 18 additional aircraft costing a total of $972 million -- not including the cost of crews and maintenance workers.
 Southwest has quietly done tests of so-called dual jet bridges in Austin and Dallas to accelerate boarding by loading passengers through two doors at once. But the bridges proved to be unreliable. The airline does use a different kind of dual bridge in Albany, but has found it only marginally better than single bridges.
 Last summer Southwest began experimenting with assigned seating, Wilma-style boarding and other loading methods on flights out of San Diego because of the variety of short, medium and long-haul flights there.
 So far, passengers polled by Southwest are evenly divided between leaving open-seating alone or changing it. ''Our fliers are passionate about what they like -- for instance, the fact they can book at the last minute without losing out on a good seat,'' said Ms. Harbin, the Southwest spokeswoman. ''But after going electronic with boarding passes, we cleared at least the technology hurdle of how to assign seats.'' Southwest is adamant about not altering its boarding system until at least 2008.
 Northwest, which has traditional assigned seating, recently replaced its back-to-front loading with Southwest-style open boarding. Some corporate travel managers have complained that their fliers are getting the Southwest open-seating treatment even though they are paying full fare. But Northwest, like most major airlines, provides a separate boarding lane for elite business travelers, even when they are late to the gate. And it says its system reduces boarding time by seven minutes.
 So which boarding technique works best? There are skeptics who scoff at all the hand-wringing and research experiments and contend that all these attempts at saving time are a waste of time.
 ''The airlines are looking for a new time-saving idea they can believe in and reduce it to a computer code,'' said Robert W. Mann, an aviation consultant in Port Washington, N.Y. ''Just say, 'It's time to go' and random boarding will get the same result as any systematization.''

HEADLINE: Bring On The Seinfeld Congress

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
I'm afraid the election results still haven't registered in Washington. Democrats and Republicans keep making noises about working together to accomplish great things. But that's not what Americans voted for. They voted for gridlock.
 They gave Congress a Seinfeld mandate to do nothing. The Democrats offered no bold new ideas, and they were rewarded with victory. Voters would like them to mop up the messes made by Republicans, but that's it. Find a way out of Iraq, and then avoid any more excellent adventures dreamed up by neoconservatives. 
Besides Iraq, the big issue bothering voters was corruption, and the best way to appease them is by working less. The fewer favors you hand out, the fewer chances to sell your vote. The smartest political move for either party would be to take a vow of abstinence by outlawing earmarks.
 It's traditional in Washington to measure a Congress's success by the number of bills it passes, but that's only because of all the lobbyists, lawyers and journalists whose livelihoods depend on quantity, not quality. A do-nothing Congress is bad for the local economy. 
 But it's fine for the rest of the country. The prospect of gridlock has been welcomed, as usual, on Wall Street. The brief era of fiscal responsibility in Washington in the 1990s occurred only because a Democratic president and a Republican Congress couldn't agree on how to spend the surplus. 
 The most successful legislation of the past decade was welfare reform, which essentially repealed the damage of the do-something Congresses of the 1960s and 1970s. Most of the legislative ''victories'' of President Bush's first term -- like the No Child Left Behind Act and the prescription drug benefit -- have turned out to be expensive mistakes.
 Some Democrats say they'd like to expand these programs, but they've been vague about how to pay for them -- and loath to talk about raising taxes. In fact, they've said one of their first priorities is cutting taxes. They want to reduce the impact of the alternative minimum tax, which hurts people making between $100,000 and $500,000 per year, especially ones living in areas with high local taxes.
 But these victims are concentrated in blue states, the very places that keep electing senators who denounce ''tax cuts for the rich.'' Why should Republicans agree to give affluent Democratic voters a tax break? Grant them their wish for social justice. If Republicans do nothing, the alternative minimum tax will gradually hit more and more people, bringing America closer to the flat-tax system favored by Republican economists.
 If House Republicans heed the election results -- and polls showing that most Americans want the federal government to do less -- they'll elect Mike Pence of Indiana as their new leader. He's got the fiscal do-nothing credentials, having voted against Bush's expensive Medicare and education reforms.
 He has also avoided the Republicans' losing strategy of bashing immigrants. Instead of just trying to seal the border, he has proposed letting immigrants enter legally if there are jobs waiting for them. With him in charge, Republicans could work out a deal with Democrats to undo Congress's past mistakes and let market forces, not rigid quotas, determine who enters America.
 It's always possible, of course, that Democrats and Republicans could agree on some radical new venture. I still like to fantasize about a grand bargain on global warming: the Republicans support a carbon tax, and the Democrats agree to refund all the revenue into new personal retirement accounts for Social Security recipients. But I'm not expecting to see them make that deal any time soon.
 Whatever they do the next two years, I won't be here to kick them around. This is my last column on the Op-Ed page. I've enjoyed the past couple of years in Washington, but one election cycle is enough. I'm returning full time to the subject and the city closest to my heart: science and New York. I'll be writing a column and a blog for the Science Times section. 
 I hate to abandon my libertarian comrades here fighting in the belly of the beast, but this is the right moment to leave. After six years of libertarians reluctantly electing Republicans as the lesser of two evils, we've finally had enough. We've voted out big-government conservatism, and the result is the happy state of gridlock. For now, our work is done. See you in January in a new column on a new page.

HEADLINE: Pakistan Link Seen in Rise In Afghan Suicide Attacks

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Afghan and NATO security forces have recently rounded up several men like Hafiz Daoud Shah, a 21-year-old unemployed Afghan refugee who says he drove across the border to Afghanistan in September in a taxi with three other would-be suicide bombers.
 Every case, Afghan security officials say, is similar to that of Mr. Shah, who repeated his story in a rare jailhouse interview with a reporter in Kabul, the Afghan capital. The trail of organizing, financing and recruiting the bombers who have carried out a rising number of suicide attacks in Afghanistan traces back to Pakistan, they say.
''Every single bomber or I.E.D. in one way or another is linked to Pakistan,'' a senior Afghan intelligence official said, referring to improvised explosive devices like roadside bombs. ''Their reasons are to keep Afghanistan destabilized, to make us fail, and to keep us fragmented.'' He would speak on the subject only if not identified. 
 A senior United States military official based in Afghanistan agreed for the most part. ''The strong belief is that recruiting, training and provision of technical equipment for I.E.D.'s in the main takes place outside Afghanistan,'' he said. By I.E.D.'s he meant suicide bombers as well. He, too, did not want his name used because he knew his remarks were likely to offend Pakistani leaders. 
 The charge is in fact one of the most contentious that Afghan and American officials have leveled at the Pakistani leadership, which frequently denies the infiltration problem and insists that the roots of the Taliban insurgency lie in Afghanistan. 
 The dispute continues to divide Afghan and Pakistani leaders, even as the Bush administration tries to push them toward greater cooperation in fighting the Taliban, whose ranks have swelled to as many as 10,000 fighters this year. 
 A year ago, roadside bombs and suicide attacks were rare occurrences in Afghanistan. But they have grown more frequent and more deadly. There have been more than 90 suicide attacks in Afghanistan this year. In September and October, nearly 100 people were killed in such attacks.
 Afghan security forces say that in the same period, they captured 17 suspected bombers, two of them would-be suicide bombers; NATO forces say they caught 10 people planning suicide bomb attacks in recent weeks. 
 Last week, for the first time, a Pakistani intelligence official acknowledged that suicide bombers were being trained in Bajaur, a small Pathan tribal area along the border. In a briefing given only on condition of anonymity, the official cited the training as one reason for an airstrike this month on a religious school there that killed more than 80 people. 
 The arrests of Mr. Shah and others like him, Afghan and NATO officials say, show that groups intent on carrying out attacks in Afghanistan continue to operate easily inside Pakistan. 
 Mr. Shah said he was one of four would-be suicide bombers who arrived in Kabul from Pakistan on Sept. 30. One of them killed 12 people and wounded 40 at the pedestrian entrance to the Interior Ministry the same day. 
 The attack was the first suicide bomb aimed not at foreign troops but at Afghans, and it terrified Kabul residents. The dead included a woman and her child. 
 By Mr. Shah's account, it could have been far worse. Mr. Shah said he and his cohort had planned to blow themselves up in four separate attacks in the capital. That they failed was due partly to luck and partly to vigilance by Afghan and NATO security forces. But their plot represented a clear escalation in the bombers' ambitions in Afghanistan.
 Wearing a black prayer cap and long beard, Mr. Shah recounted his own involvement in the presence of two Afghan intelligence officers at a jail run by the National Directorate of Security. The Afghan intelligence officers offered up Mr. Shah because, unlike others in custody facing similar charges, his investigation was over. He is now awaiting trial. 
 Mr. Shah showed no signs of fear or discomfort in front of his guards. But after two weeks in detention, he complained of tiredness and headaches from a longstanding but unspecified mental ailment, something his father confirmed in a separate interview at the family home in Karachi, the southern Pakistani port city.
 At first Mr. Shah, who was educated through the sixth grade, denied that he intended to be a suicide bomber, but said he had gone to Afghanistan only to fight a jihad, or holy war. ''I was just thinking of fighting a jihad against the infidels,'' he said. ''I was hearing there was fighting in Afghanistan and seeing it in the newspapers.''
 But by the end of the hourlong conversation, he admitted that he had intended to blow himself up in Kabul, and said he regretted his actions. He was vague about the target of his suicide mission. ''I did not know where I was going to do it,'' he said.
 After he was arrested, Mr. Shah said, he learned that one member of his group, whom he called Abdullah, succeeded in carrying out a suicide attack outside the Interior Ministry. ''When I was arrested I heard about it and I thought it must be him,'' he said.
 ''They came here to be martyred,'' he said of his three companions, all Pakistanis, all around the same age, and all also from Karachi. 
 Mr. Shah himself is one of the 2.5 million Afghans who live as refugees in Pakistan and who, officials on both sides of the border agree, frequently cycle through the ranks of the Taliban and other militant Islamic groups. 
 The would-be suicide bombers arrested recently, the Afghan intelligence official said, emerge from two clear strands. 
 Some are linked to extremist groups that have long been set up and run by Pakistani intelligence as an arm of foreign policy toward rival governments in Afghanistan and India. They are technically illegal and the government now says it has cracked down on them. 
 Others are allied with Afghan groups like the Taliban and the renegade militia commander Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, also a longtime protege of Pakistani intelligence, who has now allied himself with the Taliban, Afghan and NATO officials say. 
 Like Mr. Shah, several other would-be bombers arrested recently have come from Pakistan or were run by commanders based there, they said. 
 After a bombing cell of 12 people was picked up in Kabul recently, two of the men continued to receive cellphone calls while in custody, urging them to explode their bombs, the intelligence official said. The calls came from an Afghan commander called Pir Farouq, who lives in the Shamshatoo Afghan refugee camp in Peshawar, a frontier town, and is closely allied with Mr. Hekmatyar. 
 When Afghan intelligence, at NATO's behest, passed on the cellphone number of Pir Farouq to Pakistani intelligence officers, their informer, a member of the commander's inner circle, was swiftly killed, his body cut into eight pieces and dumped in the camp. NATO officials described the killing to journalists. 
 Another group of bombers was captured as they were planning attacks on NATO forces in northern Afghanistan. That cell was also connected to Mr. Hekmatyar, but organized by another of his commanders who lives in Quetta, a Pakistani border town, the intelligence official said. 
 In Mr. Shah's case, he and his companions had all studied at the same religious school, or madrasa, at Masjid-e-Noor, a mosque in Mansehra Colony, a working-class district in northeastern Karachi. Mr. Shah said he studied there for four years, earning the title hafiz, given to one who has memorized the Koran. 
 The madrasa was run until recently by Maulavi Abdul Shakoor Khairpuri, who, Mr. Shah said, was a member of a banned jihadi group, Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen. Mr. Shah said it was the maulavi who sent them on the suicide mission.
 The maulavi had given him a note addressed to a man called only Umar, who was waiting for them when they arrived in Kabul. Bearded, aged 28 or 29, Umar was a Taliban member from Kandahar, Mr. Shah said. 
 The note directed Umar to give the group explosives and stated that the equivalent of about $1,400 would be given to the families of each bomber after they finished their mission, Mr. Shah said. 
 Umar handed them a white rice bag. Inside were four khaki vests, with three pockets sewn on each side of the chest where the explosives were placed. ''It has wires leading to a remote control and when you press the button it explodes,'' Mr. Shah said. 
 ''The vests were heavy,'' he added. ''There were a lot of explosives.'' 
 Mr. Shah then started looking for a taxi. Someone, apparently an intelligence agent, offered to show him but led him instead to the intelligence office, where he was arrested. The other bombers slipped away with their vests. So did Umar. 
 The Afghan intelligence official confirmed much of Mr. Shah's story. So did Mr. Shah's father, Ahmed Shah, interviewed last month at his home in a run-down tenement on the east side of Karachi, though he said he did not know where his son had gone after leaving home three weeks before. The gaps and discrepancies in the father's and son's accounts seemed to indicate that neither was telling the full story.
 When told why his son was in jail in Kabul, the father grew angry, but showed no surprise. ''How can one feel when someone leaves the house without caring for his children -- he has two small children,'' he said, a boy of 4 and a girl of 2. 
 ''We got tired of talking to him; you could not talk to him,'' the father said. ''Such a disobedient child, who does not care about anyone, who does not look after his parents, should go to hell.'' 
 Mr. Shah's teacher at the local mosque also contradicted Mr. Shah's account. 
 Maulavi Khairpuri, interviewed at his home next to the Noor mosque, denied being a member of the banned Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen, as Mr. Shah had said. But he did acknowledge being the local secretary of a pro-Taliban party, Jamiat-ul-Ulama-i-Islam.
 The maulavi said he had no idea that Mr. Shah had gone to Afghanistan. He denied sending Mr. Shah on the suicide mission. ''He was not brave enough to do that,'' he said dismissively.

HEADLINE: National Briefing Washington: Racial Disparities Persist 

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
Racial disparities in income, education and home ownership persist and, by some measurements, are growing, according to data from the Census Bureau. The median income for white households was $50,622 last year. It was $30,939 for black households, $36,278 for Hispanic households and $60,367 for Asian households, the bureau reported. Three-fourths of white households owned their homes in 2005, compared with 46 percent of black households and 48 percent of Hispanic households. Black adults have narrowed the gap with white adults in receiving high school diplomas, but the gap has widened for college degrees. Thirty percent of white adults had at least bachelor's degrees in last year, compared with 17 percent of black adults and 12 percent of Hispanic adults.

HEADLINE: Educator Seen as Favorite to Succeed Palestinian Premier

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER; Taghreed El-Khodary contributed reporting from Gaza City.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Palestinian negotiators said Monday that they were penciling in the names to lead a new government. They met over the weekend and again on Monday in their effort to unite the divided factions and restart the badly needed flow of foreign aid. 
 Officials for both Hamas and Fatah say privately that there is general agreement on a replacement for Prime Minister Ismail Haniya of Hamas: Mohammad Shbair, 60, who was president of the Islamic University in Gaza City for 12 years before his retirement last year. 
The names, if tentative, appeared to be a sign of progress in talks to form a national unity government of professionals and technocrats. But leaders of Hamas, the militant group that would cede direct control of the government, and its rival Fatah, cautioned Monday that some of the toughest issues remain unresolved and that much work remained before a final deal. The talks have dragged on since the summer.
 The aid was cut off after Hamas won legislative elections in January and took control of the government in March. Even if the Palestinians manage to form a new government, it is far from clear that they can make the concessions necessary for Israel, the United States and Europe to resume aid and other financing. 
 ''We do not want to give the agenda to our people piece by piece,'' Mr. Haniya, who has declared his intention to resign soon, told reporters in Gaza City on Monday. ''We want to give them an entire program all at once.'' 
 Mr. Haniya has said that he believes that it will be two or three weeks before a final deal is reached. But the names being put forward have leaked out, and in a possible sign of Palestinians' desire to press their case with the outside world, all three candidates for top jobs have studied in the United States. 
 The planners of a unity government have said that it would be made up of people without direct ties to any faction. Mr. Shbair, who earned a doctorate in microbiology from West Virginia University, is not a member of Hamas, though the university he led has close ties with the group. 
 Other candidates for top jobs surfaced Monday after a second day of talks. For foreign minister, negotiators have mentioned Ziad Abu Amr, 56, a professor and independent lawmaker who was backed by Hamas in the parliamentary elections in January, though he has opposed suicide bombings and supports concessions with Israel. He holds a doctorate in political science from Georgetown University. 
 For finance minister, negotiators have mentioned Salam Fayyad, 54, an economist who had served from 2002 to 2006 as the finance minister for the Palestinian Authority. He earned a doctorate in economics from the University of Texas. 
 But many issues remain. Other deals have fallen through, and negotiators caution that any names are contingent on resolving the toughest questions. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president and Fatah leader, is visiting Jordan, but is scheduled to go to Gaza by the end of the week for higher-level talks. 
 In Israel, there is much skepticism about the possibility of a new government. The program the new government will embrace is more important than individual names, officials say.
 Specifically, the question is whether the Palestinians will meet three conditions set by Israel and foreign donors for a resumption of funds: that the new government recognize Israel's right to exist, that it renounce violence and that it accept previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements that imply a two-state solution. 
 A senior Israeli military official, speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said any new government would be ''Hamas lite,'' in that Hamas would still hold the majority in the Palestinian Parliament and could exert a veto on any decisions. In recent days, even as negotiations went on, Hamas leaders have said the group would not compromise on its basic principles, including not recognizing Israel. 
 The Israeli military official said: ''Even if there will be a government, we do not think it will change the fact that Hamas still will be the leading political power. It still controls the Parliament, and it still has control on the ground.'' 
 But the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, who met with President Bush on Monday, told a Palestinian newspaper, Al Quds, that he could negotiate with Hamas if it did accept the three conditions, specified by the so-called quartet guiding the stalled peace efforts -- the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations. 
 ''If Hamas accepts the quartet conditions, I will sit down with them,'' Mr. Olmert was quoted as saying.

HEADLINE: South Korea Won't Intercept Cargo Ships From the North

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
South Korea said Monday that it would not join a United States-led effort to intercept North Korean ships suspected of carrying unconventional weapons or related cargo, raising fresh doubts about Washington's drive to punish the North for its nuclear test last month.
 The South Korean government of President Roh Moo-hyun has come under increasing pressure from the political opposition and its American ally to join the campaign since the test. 
The effort to punish North Korea has become a part of the Proliferation Security Initiative, a three-year-old, American-led program to coordinate and develop procedures for intercepting smugglers of unconventional weapons around the world.
 But even as Washington sought to build unity ahead of a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Hanoi this week, and the possible resumption of six-nation talks over the North's nuclear program early next month, Seoul made it clear that it was hewing to its policy of avoiding confrontation with the North.
 South Korea has supported, but not joined, the security program, fearing that inspecting North Korean ships by force could lead to a military confrontation. 
 ''The government has declared that it has a special status of officially supporting the goals and principles of the Proliferation Security Initiative, while not formally joining it in consideration of special circumstances on the Korean Peninsula,'' Park In-kook, the deputy foreign minister, said at a news conference.
 A loose coalition of countries that have joined, including Australia and Japan, have carried out naval exercises to practice for interdictions, and a few countries have already boarded ships to and from North Korea in ports throughout Asia.
 But the legality of intercepting ships in international waters remains unclear, even under a United Nations Security Council resolution passed after the North's test. The resolution calls on countries, though it does not require them, to inspect cargo in and out of North Korea.
 On Monday, South Korean officials did not announce any new measures to comply with the resolution, repeating modest steps they had already announced in recent weeks. They said South Korea would ban the visit of any North Korean official related to the development of unconventional weapons, and would suspend subsidies for some South Koreans to visit the Mount Kumgang resort in the North.
 The South announced soon after the nuclear test that it would not suspend its two major economic projects with the North, the resort and an industrial park in Kaesong. American officials have also pressed Seoul to suspend those projects.
 Except for North Korea, the nations participating in the six-nation talks -- South Korea, the United States, China, Japan and Russia -- are expected to meet in Hanoi, Vietnam, this week to plan for the resumption of talks next month.
 North Korea withdrew from the talks a year ago after the United States imposed a crackdown on banks dealing with the North and on North Korean businesses, but agreed last month to return to the talks after American officials indicated that they would discuss the restrictions.
 In Tokyo, the Russian ambassador to Japan, Aleksandr P. Losyukov, said Monday at a news conference that the talks would probably take place in early December. But Mr. Losyukov, who had been Russia's lead negotiator in the earlier talks, played down expectations.
 ''Even if the talks are held,'' he said, ''I don't think there will be a complete solution to the problem.''

HEADLINE: Health Insurance Industry Urges Expansion of Coverage

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
The health insurance industry proposed an expansion of Medicaid and new tax breaks on Monday with the goal of guaranteeing coverage for all children in three years and for virtually all adults within 10 years. 
 New members of Congress, especially those elected on a pledge to help the uninsured, are likely to embrace many of the proposals, which provide a benchmark for debate on the issue. The debate is likely to rage in the next Congress and in the 2008 presidential campaign.
The latest government figures show that 46.6 million Americans lacked health insurance in 2005, an increase of 17 percent, or 6.8 million, from 2000. 
 ''We believe that every American should have access to affordable health care coverage,'' said J. Grover Thomas Jr., chairman of America's Health Insurance Plans, the main lobby for the industry, which offered the proposals.
 The industry proposed these steps, estimated to cost $300 billion over 10 years:
 The federal government and the states should expand Medicaid to cover all adults with annual incomes under the poverty level, including single adults who cannot now qualify. The poverty level is $16,600 for a family of three and $9,800 for an individual.
 The Children's Health Insurance Program, financed jointly by the federal government and the states, should, at a minimum, cover all children in families with incomes less than twice the poverty level.
 Congress should create tax incentives for people to establish ''universal health accounts.'' People could take tax deductions for amounts contributed to such accounts. They could use the accounts to pay premiums for any type of health insurance. The federal government would help pay premiums for people with incomes below certain levels.
 Congress should establish a tax credit for individuals and families who buy health insurance for their children. The credit would be $200 a child, up to a maximum of $500 for a family. It would be available to families with incomes up to three times the poverty level -- up to $60,000 for a family of four.
 The industry did not say how its proposals would be paid for; did not recommend any budget cuts or tax increases; and did not say what, if anything, it would do to slow the growth of health costs.
 When hospitals care for the uninsured, they often pass on some of the costs to people who have health insurance. Jay M. Gellert, president of Health Net, a managed-care company based in Woodland Hills, Calif., said this ''cost shift'' threatened to make coverage unaffordable for employers, who provide health benefits to 175 million people.
 Ronald F. Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, a liberal-leaning consumer group, said: ''Given the insurance industry's history as a major opponent of health care reform in 1993-94, this set of proposals is very welcome. The proposals for public programs, in particular, are laudable.'' 
 Grace-Marie Turner, president of the Galen Institute, a research center that advocates free-market health policies, said: ''Conservatives will be able to support this. It has something for everyone.''
 Under current law, employers can generally take tax deductions for the cost of providing health benefits to employees. The industry plan calls for a similar deduction for people who buy coverage on their own, in the individual health insurance market. 
 In a sense, insurers, like other industries, are recommending tax subsidies for the products they sell. More generally, they are proposing a public-private partnership to cope with a problem -- the soaring cost of health care and health insurance -- that affects families, employers and the nation's ability to compete in a global economy.
 ''We are the last industrialized country in the world not to have universal coverage,'' said George C. Halvorson, chairman of the Kaiser Permanente health plan.
 Many economists say the tax code is biased against individual insurance. The industry said it was proposing ''full tax deductibilty for health insurance premiums'' to correct the bias.
 C. Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said he worried that such a change could create incentives for some employees to buy insurance on their own, rather than through the workplace. ''Unless carefully designed,'' he said, ''that change could reduce the incentives for employers to provide coverage, and we could get a net increase in the number of people without insurance.''
 Mr. Thomas, who is chairman of Trustmark Mutual Holding Company, based in Lake Forest, Ill., said this concern was unfounded. Workers would generally lose the employer's subsidy for their health care if they bought insurance outside the workplace, he said.
 Many economists say the tax code, by subsidizing the purchase of health insurance, has fostered excessive use of health care services, driving up costs. ''New subsidies could aggravate that problem,'' Mr. Steuerle said.

HEADLINE: Mets Give Nod To Robinson, And to Reality

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It could have been worse. The new Mets ballpark could have been named for some company overcharging in Iraq or a scandalized corporation or a geeky-sounding electronics firm that may or may not still exist when the gates open in 2009.
 Instead, the name for the proposed ballpark gets its business done in a hurry -- Citi Field -- and allows Mets fans to return to their central issue, pitching. Many fans, being pragmatic, did not back the suggestions here and elsewhere to name the new place after Jackie Robinson. The fans just wanted the owners to come up with more corporate money to enable Omar Minaya to buy arms. 
 Rachel Robinson said she wasted no time hoping her husband would be memorialized in the full name of the Mets' planned palace in Queens. Instead, the open rotunda area behind home plate will be named for Jackie Robinson, and the Mets will support new scholarships for the Jackie Robinson Foundation and help it create a museum in Lower Manhattan. 
 ''I'm satisfied,'' Rachel Robinson said yesterday after wielding one of the shovels at the ceremonial groundbreaking on the spot where Jose Reyes and David Wright will one day frolic. She cited the economics of baseball: Published reports have said Citigroup is paying $20 million a year for 20 years to have its name on the new structure. I counted the new name at seven spots in renderings of the ballpark. 
 ''The real world is that you have to have a naming opportunity and sell it for a lot of money if you can afford a stadium in this day and age,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday. 
 The mayor is not wrong. But New York has always been different. It isn't the Piggly Wiggly Madison Square Garden, not yet, or the Wal-Mart Yankee Stadium. In fact, when the Yankees broke ground for their own joint last August, their officials emphasized that the new ballpark would be called Yankee Stadium -- a magic brand all its own -- although I fully expect some corporate presence to pop up on the next big ballyard in the Bronx, like a zit. 
 The big city is going the way of all the burghs that have succumbed to the offer of cash. Gone are the days of naming ballparks after sports heroes or teams or even the owners themselves. In recent years, many stadiums have been named after companies that I could not identify. Some of the companies went belly up. There may or may not be a moral to this.
 The Wilpon family that owns the Mets has an active philanthropic side, but it also knows how to arrange the best financing -- $550 million of tax-exempt bonds and $65 million of taxable bonds. Fred Wilpon, a builder, had elaborate plans for a ballpark alongside the current Shea Stadium, but those hopes were postponed by the practicalities after 9-11. 
 When the city's hopes for a multipurpose 2012 Olympic stadium on the West Side of Manhattan did not work out, the time came around for ballparks. Eighty-one home games a year have some civic and economic value. 
 When the Yankees broke ground in August, the projected new Yankee Stadium seemed abstract because we were still smack in the middle of the season. Yesterday, nobody offended sensibilities by noting how much they are doing for ''you people,'' the way George Steinbrenner did last summer. The damp and blustery November weather held no promise of a ballgame, although Governor George E. Pataki, uncharacteristically animated, evoked warm memories of Choo Choo Coleman, Rod Kanehl and Jay Hook, making it 1962 all over again. 
 The current stalwarts Wright, Reyes and John Maine were just back from barnstorming in Japan. Even on jet lag, their youth and energy seemed wasted as they attended the ritual beyond their current ballpark. 
 The construction in the Bronx has already taken away a park from its neighbors. (Allegedly, the city will install park fragments on top of parking garages when the construction is over.) The new place in Queens is taking place on a former parking lot. The scenic chop shops just to the east of Shea, with wrecked cars stacked everywhere, will eventually be relocated.
 But first, a new ballpark, smaller but reminiscent of Shea Stadium, will rise on the reclaimed swampland. And a rotunda, with its reference to the fabled rotunda at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, will bear the name and inspiring words of Jackie Robinson. His widow, vibrant and quite beautiful at 84, said she looked forward to fans walking through the rotunda and thinking of more than the game.
 In recent months, some people could not get past the fact that Robinson was never a Met. More to the point, Jackie Robinson was an American hero. A Brooklyn guy, Fred Wilpon, has made sure that his childhood hero in Brooklyn will be honored in this new place in Queens. 
 As far as the hard-core contemporary fans are concerned, the new place could be named Halliburton or Enron if the owners took the corporate booty and could import Dontrelle Willis right here and now.

 Yet such turbulence has often been a catalyst for Garcia's best performances. Throughout a 20-year career, he has often found his form when his personal life appeared headed for disaster.
Whether it was a fight with a girlfriend or hatred of the contest director and host country, ''I found power in everything,'' said Garcia, who won the Association of Surfing Professionals world title in 2000. 
 ''This is my way out of reality,'' he said. ''Go in the water, have fun, do what I do best. I've taken bad things and turned them into good things.''
 Perhaps Garcia, 36, can channel his latest troubles into success at the Triple Crown of Surfing, which begins this week -- when the waves are right -- in Haleiwa, Hawaii, on the North Shore of Oahu. Garcia has won the series a record six times, and this will be his last opportunity to compete before beginning a prison sentence for tax evasion.
 Garcia was sentenced Oct. 18 in federal court in San Diego to three months in prison and seven months' home confinement for failing to report more than $400,000 in prize money.
 According to the office of the United States attorney for the Southern District of California, Garcia pleaded guilty in June to failing to report $161,450 in cash and traveler's checks he received as prize money in 2000, the year he won the world title. He also pleaded guilty to filing false tax returns for the years 1996-1999 and 2001, and failing to report another $255,635 in winnings.
 He could have received up to three years in prison. United States District Court Judge Thomas J. Whelan said Garcia did not have to report to prison until Jan. 12, 2007, two days before he turns 37.
 If not for surfing, Garcia might have been behind bars sooner. ''Most of my friends I did go to school with are either dead or in prison,'' he said.
 Born in Honolulu, Garcia grew up in Waianae, on Oahu's socially and economically depressed West Side. He dropped out of school in ninth grade and became a professional surfer at 16, launching a career as colorful and as complicated as the tattoo of Hawaiian and surfing symbols on his left shoulder.
 By 1990, he cracked the top 10 in the rankings and he remained there for the next 11 years. He won his first three Triple Crown titles in 1992, '93 and '94. But Garcia's talent was sometimes overshadowed by his behavior.
 He threw things at the competition judges if he did not like their scoring and was a notorious brawler. 
 ''A lot of people are intimidated by him,'' said Randy Rarick, the Triple Crown executive director. ''He's got that look like a prizefighter. When he paddles out, he'll snarl at you, 'I'm going to get that wave.' I think he takes out his aggressive nature in the water.''
 His approach has caused grief, but it has also allowed Garcia to prosper, riding a rising wave of earnings and sponsorship money over the past two decades.
 He became only the second surfer to win more than $1 million. Garcia also had a signature video game and appeared on a reality television show. But he lost most of his money through overspending and poor real estate investments.
 ''I don't do this because, oh, I'm going to be rich,'' he said. ''I like to surf. I don't care about the whole other business side.
 ''I learned one thing: Don't trust your C.P.A., that's for sure.''
 His legal troubles have contributed to the ending of his marriage to the former Raina Cabell, daughter of the legendary surfer Joey Cabell.
 ''Leaving her has almost been unbearable for me,'' Garcia said, revealing a tender side usually reserved for friends and family. Garcia also has three children from his first marriage.
 ''I saw him with his kids, being the perfect father,'' Rarick said, ''what we call ohana -- family.''
 Phil Irons, the father of the professional surfers Bruce and the three-time world champion Andy, said: ''He's like a big brother to my sons. He's even referred to me as Dad. He's as gnarly as they come and he's as gracious.''
 During the 1990s, Garcia fiercely defended surfers' interests while a representative for the surfing professionals' union, earning the respect and admiration of his competitors.
 ''He stood up for me at times,'' said Rob Machado, who competed against Garcia for a decade on the world tour. ''He's had my back for a long time, and I back him.''
 At 5 feet 10 inches and 200 pounds, Garcia has a powerful style, best suited to the large waves that occur during the Triple Crown. The competition, which ranks second only to a world championship in prestige, is made up of three events on Oahu's North Shore and culminates at the famous Banzai Pipeline in December.
 ''I know the spot,'' Garcia said of the North Shore. ''This is my home. My friends are here cheering for me. That's enough to push you.''
 Garcia also has his legacy to consider. Although he retired from the world tour after the 2005 season, he has planned a comeback to write a coda to his controversial biography.
 ''I don't want the last thing remembered about me to be tax evasion,'' he said. ''I'm not done yet.''

HEADLINE: Honoring Pioneer Is Part of Plans for Citi Field

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
A rotunda honoring the life of Jackie Robinson, Citibank A.T.M.'s, a 41 percent increase in concessions and enough restaurant capacity to feed 3,134 people are among the features planned for the Mets' new ballpark, Citi Field, which is scheduled to replace Shea Stadium in 2009, the team announced yesterday.
 Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other politicians joined the Mets' principal owner, Fred Wilpon, and several team officials and players yesterday for a ceremonial groundbreaking on a new 42,500-seat stadium. The design for the stadium is inspired by Ebbets Field, the former home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and is expected to cost nearly $800 million. 
Under a 20-year sponsorship deal with Citigroup, the stadium will be named Citi Field, displacing the name of William A. Shea. Shea, a lawyer, helped bring National League baseball back to New York in 1962, five years after the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants left. Shea Stadium opened in 1964.
 The Mets have encountered some criticism for not naming the new stadium for Robinson, the Dodgers legend who broke baseball's color barrier in 1947, but Wilpon said fans would be welcomed into the soaring Jackie Robinson Rotunda, inscribed with this quotation from Robinson: ''A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives.'' The rotunda will include a statue, still to be designed, and an exhibition on Robinson's life.
 The Mets also pledged to help the Jackie Robinson Foundation, created in 1973, build a museum and education center in Lower Manhattan. The foundation has given college scholarships to more than 1,100 minority students.
 ''It is my hope that as individuals and groups walk through the rotunda, they will begin to be inspired and begin to think about their own lives and what the meaning of their own lives is,'' Robinson's widow, Rachel Robinson, said at the ceremony. ''I hope it will spread not just some joy, but some critical thinking about our society.''
 Wilpon said that corporate support was essential to the project. ''With the economics that go along with building a stadium like this, it is imperative that we receive revenues,'' he said.
 The Mets are financing the stadium with about $615 million in bonds. The city will contribute $90 million in capital funds and the state will contribute $75 million in rent credits to be used for infrastructure projects. The Mets have promised to use the stadium for at least 35 years.
 The city estimates that the project will create 6,000 construction jobs while preserving the 1,000 jobs at Shea Stadium.
 To secure City Council support for the bond financing, the Mets promised to devote 25 percent of their annual community and charitable efforts to Queens groups, and to have at least 25 percent of construction contracts and jobs go to Queens companies and residents. They said another 25 percent would go to firms owned by women or minorities. 
 In addition to naming rights, Citigroup, a financial services company, agreed to buy time on SportsNet New York, a television network the Mets launched in March. The Citigroup name will be integrated into the team's marketing and publicity campaigns and appear on walls, scoreboards, videos and automated teller machines throughout the ballpark. 
 The number of toilets will increase, to 646 from 568, as will the number of wheelchair-accessible seats (to 830 from 174), luxury suites (to 54 from 45) and public elevators (to 11 from 4). The new stadium store will be 7,200 square feet; the store at Shea is 2,600 square feet.

HEADLINE: Red Sox Foil Yanks in Bidding for Pitcher

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
This is about the Boston Red Sox and Daisuke Matsuzaka, but first a word about George Steinbrenner, a sad word. Despite all the denials from the Yankees, he is not the man he used to be. Whether old age or illness is the cause, Steinbrenner demonstrated beyond all question yesterday that he was living in another stage of life, far removed from the life he lived for most of his 34 years as the principal owner of the Yankees.
 ''George will have no comment on this,'' Howard Rubenstein, his spokesman, said when asked if Steinbrenner would comment on the Matsuzaka development. 
While no official announcement will be made until tonight, the Matsuzaka development was that the Red Sox were the winning bidder for Matsuzaka, the young pitcher who may be the best ever to come out of Japan.
 Two executives in Major League Baseball said they were told that the Red Sox had won the right to negotiate with Matsuzaka. One of the executives said that people in baseball and in Japan had acknowledged that the winning bid was in the $45 million range. The executives were granted anonymity because the deal was not yet official.
 That figure, the official said, would be perhaps 50 percent higher than the other bids, including those submitted by the Mets and the Yankees. He said the other bids were either slightly above or slightly below $30 million. But the second executive said at least three other clubs had bid ''in excess of the mid-30's.''
 A lawyer who has baseball and Japanese connections said Japanese baseball people had thought the winning bid would be $15 million to $20 million. They hoped inflation might take the bid to the upper figure, much higher than the $13,125,000 the Seattle Mariners bid for the rights to Ichiro Suzuki six years ago, the last time a Japanese player was up for bid. The Japanese are obviously out of touch with developments and rivalries in Major League Baseball. 
 John Henry, the Red Sox' managing partner, declined to comment when asked in an e-mail message about the Red Sox bid. 
 Steinbrenner isn't commenting on it either, even though it was the Red Sox chief executive, Larry Lucchino, who four years ago next month unforgettably labeled the Yankees the evil empire after they beat out Boston for Jose Contreras, who was a free-agent pitcher after defecting from Cuba.
 '''The evil empire extends its tentacles even into Latin America,'' Lucchino said.
 When Rubenstein was reminded of that remark, he laughed and said, ''George will still have no comment.''
 In the past, Steinbrenner would not have passed up an opportunity to comment caustically on what the Red Sox bid, especially with the evil empire label still in his mind. Those who have heard many of his comments can only shake our heads in sorrow and accept that an era has passed.
 In Steinbrenner's place, can we throw Lucchino's comment back at him? Is there anything evil about what the Red Sox have done? Mind boggling perhaps, but not evil. Stunning perhaps, but not evil. Incredulous maybe, but not evil. Obscene, as an executive of another club said, but not evil. 
 What the Red Sox have done is forfeit their right to complain ever again about economic moves the Yankees make. The Red Sox could argue that even if their bid were added to their payroll, it wouldn't match the Yankees' payroll. The Yankees' payroll this year was $214 million, the Red Sox $130 million.
 But the Boston bid is an expenditure the Yankees have never made. When the Yankees have signed Japanese players, they have been free agents. 
 The posting process, though, gave the Red Sox a chance to trump the Yankees. And they most likely had the specter of the Yankees clearly in mind when Henry; the co-owner, Tom Werner; Lucchino and General Manager Theo Epstein sat down to figure out what to bid for negotiating rights to Matsuzaka. They were determined not to let the Yankees beat them out again, damn the cost, full speed ahead.
 If they outbid the Yankees by $10 million or by $15 million, it was merely the cost of doing business because if they didn't outbid the Yankees, they wouldn't have any business to transact with Scott Boras, Matsuzaka's agent.
 Of course, now the Red Sox have to sign Matsuzaka, a 26-year-old right-hander. There was instant speculation yesterday that they submitted such a gigantic bid because they were intent on keeping Matsuzaka from the Yankees; if they didn't sign him, so be it.
 But a team executive said that if the Red Sox were indeed the winning bidder, they would make every effort to sign Matsuzaka. This was not a blocking bid, he said. 
 Because Matsuzaka is not a free agent, he does not have the leverage of negotiating with more than one team. Still, there will be great pressure on the Red Sox to complete the deal. Failure to sign him would be highly embarrassing for the Red Sox, and their frenzied fans would not let them forget it.
 ''In this situation,'' said Boras, always looking for a negotiating edge, ''the pressure is more on the major league team. The clock is ticking for them. They're focused on this player, and that prevents them from making a move with someone else.''
 The Red Sox and Boras will have 30 days to negotiate a contract. They will be successful if the Red Sox have any money left.

HEADLINE: With a Dish, Broadband Goes Rural

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The town of Rindge, N.H., is just 70 miles from Boston, but to telephone and cable companies it might as well be at the end of the earth. Many of the town's 5,500 residents cannot get broadband Internet access from the providers in the area, Verizon and Pine Tree Cable, even though communities nearby have had the service for years.
 Craig Clark, who works from home in Rindge, made do with a sluggish dial-up line until he signed up for broadband service from the satellite provider WildBlue Communications last autumn. With a 26-inch dish outside his home and a modem inside, Mr. Clark now connects to the Internet at speeds similar to those offered by the phone company.
''It's not a perfect technology, but it is one of the best options for those of us in rural areas,'' he said. 
 In bringing Mr. Clark and others in rural America into the fast lane, WildBlue and its chief rivals -- Hughes Network Systems, which markets under the name HughesNet, and Spacenet, which sells the StarBand service -- are filling one of the biggest gaps in the country's digital infrastructure. Roughly 15 million households cannot get broadband from their phone or cable provider because the companies have been slow to expand their high-speed networks in areas where there are not enough customers to generate what they regard as an adequate profit.
 There are some drawbacks to the satellite approach that make it unlikely to be a serious rival to more common broadband options, as Mr. Clark has found. 
 WildBlue's cheapest service costs $50 a month, about twice Verizon's introductory offer, and the dish costs several hundred dollars. Heavy rain sometimes interrupts the signal and knocks out Mr. Clark's service, and small delays are common as signals beam to and from a satellite orbiting 24,000 miles above the earth.
 But alternative technologies, like wide-area wireless services and access over power lines, are still in their infancy. And demand for broadband in rural areas is as strong if not stronger than in suburbs and cities. Broadband is essential to distance-learning programs, health clinics that communicate with bigger hospitals and farmers who rely on the latest market and weather data. Second-home owners and resorts are potential customers, too.
 ''If you don't have a broadband connection, you'll be left in a backwater and won't be able to take part in the economy,'' said David J. Leonard, WildBlue's chief executive. ''There's a growing unmet demand in these markets.''
 While the subscriber numbers for satellite services are a fraction of what companies like Comcast and AT&T have, they are growing quickly. The number of households and businesses that use them is expected to hit 463,000 this year, up 34.5 percent from 2005, according to NSR, a telecom research firm. The number of subscribers will nearly double, to 897,000, by 2010, the group estimates.
 Hughes, which got into the business about two decades ago by providing data links to gas stations, convenience stores and far-flung company offices, has dishes at about 500,000 sites. About 80 percent of the 10,000 or so new customers that sign up for its HughesNet service each month are consumers.
 WildBlue, which is adding nearly 15,000 customers a month, expects to have 120,000 subscribers by the end of this year. StarBand has about 30,000 customers.
 Operating margins at satellite broadband providers are about twice those at cable companies, which must pay heavily for programming and employ teams of workmen to handle installations.
 WildBlue and Hughes, on the other hand, outsource the work to third-party installers and dealers. Their biggest constant expenses are for marketing and subsidies for the dishes and other equipment.
 Both Hughes and WildBlue, however, will launch satellites in the coming months equipped with new technology to provide access to far more customers. Since these cost about $250 million each, a lot more customers will be needed to pay for them.
 For now, customers with few alternatives appear willing to absorb the relatively high prices. WildBlue, StarBand and HughesNet offer several speeds of service for $50 to $130 a month. Installation fees and the dish can cost another $500, though discounts abound.
 ''People are willing to spend to get broadband,'' said Pradman P. Kaul, chief executive of both Hughes Network Systems and its parent company, Hughes Communications. ''The economics are not a hurdle,'' he said, adding that nearly 40 percent of his new subscribers choose the faster plans.
 The companies do not always keep all of that revenue. WildBlue, for instance, has struck deals to be a wholesale provider of Internet service for AT&T and the satellite television companies DirecTV and EchoStar. These companies market the service but keep a share of the monthly revenue and receive equipment at subsidized rates. 
 AT&T, which is using satellite broadband to reach the 20 percent of its customers who are unable to get its fixed-line service, brands its product ''AT&T high-speed Internet powered by WildBlue.'' Since May, it has signed up about 4,000 subscribers, according to Mr. Leonard.
 Hughes bypasses the middleman by selling directly to consumers. But it has to pay for all its own marketing, which can be expensive when trying to reach small pockets of customers spread across the country. Satellite providers spend about $600 to find and sign up each new customer.
 For now, the companies have plenty of money to keep them going. Hughes Communications went public in February, and its shares have nearly doubled since, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $840 million. In the second quarter it lost $4.4 million, far smaller than the $55.5 million loss in the first quarter. 
 WildBlue has been around for almost a decade, but really got going in 2003 when Liberty Media, Intelsat, the investment firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and the National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative invested $156 million. In August, WildBlue issued $350 million in debt to help pay for the satellite that the company plans to launch before the end of the year. 
 Mr. Leonard said that while going public was an option, he first wanted WildBlue to turn a profit at least in terms of net cash flow.
 Meeting that target will be a challenge. WildBlue had to set up waiting lists in Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri and Ohio, among other places, because the satellite beams that serve those areas are full. In contrast to satellite TV, the Internet service involves two-way signals that require more satellite capacity as more customers are added. Software upgrades and the new satellite will ease the bottleneck. 
 But at the same time, cable and phone companies are making a slow push into previously unserved areas, shrinking the pool of potential customers.
 Atlantic Broadband, a small cable company with operations along the East Coast, has started selling broadband in rural southwestern Pennsylvania, where Kelly Rusinack, a HughesNet subscriber, lives. After she tried the cable service at her sister's house next door, she decided to switch once her contract with HughesNet expires in January.
 ''My sister's service is so much better than what I have, it's disgusting,'' she said, adding that cable broadband costs about $50 a month -- half of what Hughes charges her -- and the connection is more reliable.
 There is little chance, however, that a cable company will make it to Dr. Brooke Swearingen's second home in Rangeley, Me., about 20 miles from the Canadian border. His home is about 12 miles from town, too far from Verizon's switching station to get its high-speed Internet service. 
 Dr. Swearingen and his wife, Marlene, are physicians from the Boston area, need a good connection to do research and check e-mail, and their dial-up line was too slow. Dr. Swearingen said he found WildBlue online and signed up for the $50 monthly service in August; the dish and installation were free.
 The big hurdle was finding a direct shot to the sky, which required trimming a few tree branches.
 The extra speed and always-on connection means the Swearingens are able to extend their getaways and avoid having to run home to get work done.
 ''If my wife didn't have this and had to write a paper, she'd stay in Boston,'' Dr. Swearingen said. ''You'd love it to be faster, but compared to dial-up, it's night and day. It lets us get away and still be connected.''

HEADLINE: Commerce Secretary Tries Personal Persuasion in China

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BEIJING, Tuesday, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez urged Beijing on Tuesday to toughen a crackdown on pirated goods and other copyright infringements, saying failure to do so could fuel an American backlash against trade with China. 
 Despite Chinese progress in protecting intellectual property rights, Mr. Gutierrez said American Customs agents seized more counterfeit goods from China than all other countries combined.
To turn the tide, he said China needs to attack the criminal gangs that are behind the manufacture and trade of most pirated goods. He also called on Beijing to amend laws to make it easier to allow criminal prosecution of infringements against intellectual property, or I.P., and to step up cooperation with international law enforcement.
 ''Another victim of widespread I.P. theft in China is American support for expanding our trade relationship,'' Mr. Gutierrez told Chinese and American business executives. ''Those who espouse protectionism, those who would like to see protectionist policies put in place as a legitimate economic policy have a loud voice.'' 
 The United States' trade deficit with China is worsening, projected to grow 12 percent to $228 billion this year. Mr. Gutierrez, on his fourth trip to China in 18 months, said he would return to Beijing next month with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to talk about a wide array of economic issues.
 Widespread theft of intellectual property, as well as protectionist policies and unclear regulations, have long been seen as hampering foreign companies' access to the Chinese market.
 To correct the imbalances and curb piracy, Mr. Gutierrez said China must open its markets more widely, especially to American entertainment companies. 
 Limits on the number of foreign movies allowed into China has contributed to a market for pirated copies, with digital video discs of Hollywood blockbusters selling for $1 in many Chinese cities.

HEADLINE: A Setback For Vietnam Trade Bill

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
In an embarrassing legislative setback for the administration, the House of Representatives defeated a measure late Monday that the president had sought to normalize trade relations with Vietnam, four days before Mr. Bush was scheduled to leave for his first visit to that country. 
 The setback may be only temporary, however. 
The legislation embodies approval by Congress of what is known as ''permanent normal trade relations'' with Vietnam, which would make it easier for that country to join the World Trade Organization and would allow American companies to share in the benefits of the open market.
 The legislation received a majority vote but fell short of the two-thirds needed for passage under special rules that speeded its consideration in the House. The vote came on the first day of the lame-duck session in which the outgoing House, still controlled by a Republican majority, met to pass crucial bills by the end of this year.
 The legislation received 228 votes in favor and 161 against, but it needed 32 more votes to pass on Monday. House Republican leaders said they would bring the legislation back in the next couple of days under normal procedures, which require only a majority, or 218 votes, for passage.
 Though perhaps symbolic, the defeat in the House was an embarrassment not only for Mr. Bush but also for the departing Republican leaders, who had earlier in the day expressed confidence that they had the two-thirds needed for the bill to pass in the House. 
 Republican leaders expect the bill to pass the Senate later this week, despite the misgivings from some lawmakers.
 The White House still hopes for the bill's approval in the next couple of days so that President Bush can cite its passage as a milestone in relations with Vietnam while attending the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Hanoi.
 The loss, however temporary, was also a portent that trade bills could face tougher odds in the lame-duck session and in January, when Democrats take control of both the House and Senate. Many Democrats who won election last week pledged to try to block trade bills they viewed as threatening American jobs.
 It is not clear whether the preliminary defeat was spurred by anti-trade sentiment or lingering sentiment against Vietnam, which many conservatives still regard as an enemy three decades after the end of a war in which tens of thousands of Americans died.
 Trade bills for Peru, other Andean nations and a larger body of poor countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America are also on the schedule for the lame-duck Congressional session, and it is not clear whether the defeat of the Vietnam bill would damp the chances for these bills.
 There was no immediate comment on the defeat from the Bush administration. 
 Susan C. Schwab, the chief United States trade negotiator, flew to Vietnam on Monday for what had been planned as a set of meetings to celebrate a step forward for a country that was a bitter enemy of the United States a generation ago.
 Ms. Schwab had called on Congress to approve the measure to ''integrate this economically vibrant country into the global community of trading nations'' and ''open up exciting new trade and investment opportunities'' for American companies.
 The Bush administration has argued that despite the past bitterness with Vietnam, and a Vietnamese economy that is still heavily influenced by the government, the best strategy to open it up to private investment from the West is to have Vietnam become a member of the World Trade Organization, which oversees trade rules. Trade negotiators last week approved Vietnam's entry into the W.T.O.
 The legislation is necessary because a cold-war-era measure known as the Jackson-Vanik law requires an annual review of Vietnam's political and economic practices and an annual granting of trade preferences, and that law must be rescinded under W.T.O. rules.
 The administration argues that giving Vietnam ''normal'' trade preferences is the best way of getting it to adhere to the rule of law in trade relations, including provisions that allow the United States to pursue its rights through the organization. 
 Belonging to the trade organization also obliges Vietnam to end curbs on imports, eliminate certain subsidies and act to outlaw piracy of American software, videos and other copyrighted items.
 Even under the law, however, the United States still has the right to designate Vietnam a ''nonmarket economy'' -- that is, a state-controlled economy that continues to operate under Communist principles. But the Bush administration sought the trade bill as a means to get Vietnam to change.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 16, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the defeat of a Vietnam trade bill in the House referred incorrectly to the legislation that must be waived in order to grant permanent normal trade status to Vietnam. The measure, known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment, is part of the Trade Act of 1974; it is not by itself a law.

HEADLINE: Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Maintain Tough Front on Iran

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
President Bush and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel kept up their tough talk on Iran on Monday, warning it once again to drop its nuclear ambitions, even as Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain suggested that Tehran could take a role in stabilizing Iraq under ''a new partnership.'' 
 Officials in Israel have expressed increasing fear that Mr. Bush will reduce the pressure on Iran to cease its nuclear program as calls increase from European allies and at home to seek Tehran's help in Iraq. 
But Mr. Bush, speaking after his meeting with the Israeli leader, said his position on talks with Iran had not changed. ''If the Iranians want to have a dialogue with us, we have shown them a way forward,'' he said, ''and that is for them to verify -- verifiably suspend their enrichment activities.''
 In comments to reporters, Mr. Olmert warned that Iran posed a threat not just to Israel, but to the world. A spokeswoman said later that was his main message to President Bush during their nearly hour-long Oval Office meeting on Monday, though State Department officials said Mr. Bush needed no such reminders. 
 ''The fact that the leader of a nation such as Iran can threaten the very existence of another nation, as he does towards Israel,'' Mr. Olmert said of the Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, ''is not something that we can tolerate or would ever tolerate.'' 
 Iranian media on Monday quoted Mr. Ahmadinejad saying of Israel, ''We will soon witness its disappearance and destruction.''
 Mr. Blair spoke in a foreign policy address in Britain about the same time that Mr. Bush and Mr. Olmert met, first in the Oval Office and then for a working lunch that included some of their top aides. It was the second White House meeting between the leaders since Mr. Olmert became prime minister, and their first since Israel's unsuccessful campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon this summer.
 Though Mr. Blair's stance on Iran, telegraphed in the British press beforehand, hovered over the talks in Washington, American officials were careful to note that Mr. Blair had made tough demands, including an insistence that Iran would have to change its behavior drastically to become a negotiating partner.
 Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Olmert entered the talks in weakened political positions: Mr. Olmert's popularity has dipped significantly since the 34-day war with Hezbollah; Mr. Bush lost his governing Congressional majority just one week ago.
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Olmert also warned Syria against interfering in Lebanon, where Hezbollah has provoked a political crisis by seeking more power in the government. But the two leaders seemed more open than they have been recently concerning possibly closer relations with Syria, with Mr. Olmert saying, ''I hope that one day the conditions for contacts between them and us will be created.'' 
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Olmert, Miri Eisin, said Mr. Olmert and Mr. Bush discussed everything from the American elections to the Israeli economy. But Ms. Eisin said that ''the Iranian issue was the main issue on the table'' and that Mr. Olmert was comforted by Mr. Bush's tone.
 Ms. Eisin said Mr. Bush and Mr. Olmert also discussed the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, though that process is in limbo as Hamas and the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, seek to form a unity government in the hopes of ending the Palestinians' international isolation. Israel, the European Union and the United States all cut off money to the Palestinian Authority after Hamas came to power.

HEADLINE: French Plan Would Tax Imports From Non-Signers of Kyoto Pact

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin of France on Monday proposed introducing punitive taxes on imports from countries that refused to sign the United Nations' Kyoto Protocol, which is aimed at curbing global warming. 
 The protocol requires 35 developing nations to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases, but the world's top two polluters, the United States and China, have not signed the pact.
A group of 189 countries are debating how to create a united response to the threat of climate change at a two-week conference in Nairobi, Kenya.
 But Mr. de Villepin said Monday that the talks were struggling, and he urged Europe to devise ways of pressing reluctant nations to support the Kyoto pact.
 ''Europe has to use all its weight to stand up to this sort of environmental dumping,'' Mr. de Villepin said at a sustainable-development meeting, according to the text of his speech published on his official Web site.
 ''I would like us to study now with our European partners the principle of a carbon tax on the import of industrial products from countries that refuse to commit themselves to the Kyoto Protocol after 2012,'' he said.
 Mr. de Villepin added that France would make concrete proposals about how such a tax might work in the first quarter of 2007. French officials are also expected to promote the plan at the meeting in Nairobi, which will continue until Friday.
 ''The environment is a global issue,'' Mr. de Villepin said. ''Our efforts will be worthless if we are the only ones fighting for the future of the planet.'' 
 He said that in France, his government would impose a tax on coal usage and would increase taxes on industrial pollution and on aircraft noise pollution by 10 percent.
 He also suggested that trucks in ''sensitive zones'' like the Alpine regions might face higher taxes or tolls. By contrast, tax breaks would be offered to families who renovated their houses to make them more energy efficient. Environmental issues are moving up the French political agenda ahead of the presidential election set for next year.
 The Kyoto Protocol has become something of a litmus test of international willingness to avert what many scientists say will be severe climate disruptions, including heat waves, floods, desertification and rising sea levels.
 President Bush pulled the United States out of the accord in 2001, contending that it lacked targets for developing nations and that it would be too costly.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 17, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A Reuters article on Tuesday about a plan by France to tax imports from countries that have not signed the Kyoto treaty to reduce greenhouse gases misstated the positions of China and the United States. Both have indeed signed the treaty and China has also ratified it, but the United States has not.

HEADLINE: Environmentalists, Though Winners in the Election, Warn Against Expecting Vast Changes

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 

 BODY:
Last week's election whipsawed the Congressional committees that are crucial battlegrounds for environmental and energy legislation. But even many environmentalists believe that an ambitious new agenda is unlikely. 
 The leadership changes are striking. Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, who favors mandatory cuts in emissions linked to global warming, will become chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, replacing Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who has called the scientific consensus on human-induced global warming ''the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on mankind.''
In the House, Jerry McNerney, a California Democrat and wind-energy executive, will replace the current chairman of the House Resources Committee, Representative Richard W. Pombo, a Republican who fought to open public lands to private interests. 
 ''I think you'd have to go back to the Enlightenment to find such a big change in worldviews,'' Ken Cook, the president of the Environmental Working Group, a research organization, told reporters on Monday.
 But despite the committee changes, some lobbyists are trying to dampen expectations that a major environmental agenda can speed through Congress.
 While environmental groups are likely to worry less about oil and natural gas wells in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, they say that trying to get the new Congress to embrace initiatives like tougher automobile fuel-economy standards and requirements that industry pay more for Superfund cleanups could mean that little, if anything, will be accomplished.
 Melinda Pierce, a senior lobbyist with the Sierra Club, said in an interview, ''The environmental community has to recognize how difficult it's going to be to advance an environmental agenda with such narrowly held majorities.''
 Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico and the presumptive new chairman of the Energy Committee, said in an interview: ''I think there's a danger of trying to overreach. The close divide between Democrats and Republicans ensures we can't pass anything unless we get some Republican support.''
 Even before the 110th Congress is sworn in, there is unfinished business for the 109th, including the question of how much to expand energy drilling along the outer continental shelf. Many on Capitol Hill believe that two rival measures -- an expansive House bill and a more limited Senate bill that would open 8.3 million acres of federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico to energy exploration -- have little chance of passing. 
 Bob Greco, an expert on oil and gas exploration and production, said he thought that Congress would eventually open more areas to the energy industry. 
 ''Our sense is that Congress might be willing to work on a bill to improve domestic access,'' Mr. Greco said, adding, ''You need both increased resources as well as conservation and energy efficiency.'' 
 The agenda for the next Congress is a work in progress, legislators and lobbyists said. Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust and a former senior Democratic Senate staff member, said in an interview on Thursday, ''It's very clear that the House Democrats want to move a piece of energy legislation sometime this spring.''
 Mr. Clapp said the measure would probably provide incentives for the production of biologically based fuels, like ethanol. 
 Mr. Bingaman said he would continue to push for requirements that at least 10 percent of any utility's electricity be generated by renewable sources like geothermal, solar and wind energy by the year 2020. He also said he wanted to guide legislation mandating energy-efficiency measures through the next Congress.
 In an interview on Monday, Senator Boxer said her first priority would be to hold hearings on global warming. These would first review the half-dozen proposals that senators have put forward to slow the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, then focus on choosing the best approach. ''Many states are way ahead of us,'' she said. 
 Her other chief concern, she said, is ''protecting children and families'' from toxic chemicals, by, among other things, ensuring that the risks from Superfund sites is made public.
 The views held by Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, show the difficulty in finding support for a broad agenda. Mr. Dingell supports the control and cleanup of toxic substances but has never embraced automobile fuel-efficiency standards.
 Mandates on fuel efficiency for cars have had wavering support from Congress since the original passage of a fuel-economy law in 1975. 
 In March, the federal Transportation Department ruled that by 2011 the largest light trucks and sport-utility vehicles must average 24 miles per gallon and the others in this class 28.4 miles per gallon. Anna Aurelio, an environmental lobbyist for the United States Public Interest Research Group, said Monday that a 40-miles-per-gallon standard was feasible for all passenger vehicles.
 In an e-mail message, Mr. Dingell was noncommittal about tightening fuel-efficiency standards but said he would be assertive in oversight of the Energy Department and of Superfund cleanups. His strong stance on oversight has been a career trademark. Given that, and the questions many Democrats have after six years with little chance to probe administration decisions, a season of oversight hearings is at hand.
 ''I think we're still looking at a big turnaround in the tenor of the debate,'' Mr. Cook said, ''and the nature of information coming out of Washington.''

HEADLINE: Why Roots Matter More

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
LIKE most people, Melissa Steineger threw out her bagged spinach when the nationwide E. coli outbreak happened in September.
 The contamination, which infected 199 people and killed 3, was linked recently to infected cattle living near the spinach fields in central California and to feral pigs, which might have carried the bacteria to the plants.
But weeks before the source was found, Ms. Steineger, a filmmaker and writer in Portland, Ore., decided to start eating leafy greens again. Only this time they were from PastaWorks, a local food store that buys its produce from local farmers. 
 ''That's good enough for me,'' she said. 
 Ms. Steineger's reach for food grown on smaller farms close to home is part of a larger trend that food industry analysts say is gaining ground among consumers who are willing to pay a little more for quality food. As a result, people who grow food on small farms or make artisanal cheese or other foods on a more regional scale are finding new eaters.
 They are also forgoing traditional sales methods and marketing approaches. Instead of trying to break into large distribution chains and fighting for shelf space, they are finding that smaller is better, particularly if there is a good back story. Produce from an upstate New York farm, for example, reinvigorated the image of Great Performances, a Manhattan catering company, earlier this year. In California, a family that makes olive oil dropped out of many mainstream grocery stores in favor of farmers' markets and Internet sales.
 And at Tierra Farms, a 20-acre urban farm near Santa Rosa, Calif., sales are approaching $500,000 with a customer base made up mostly of people who live less than 30 miles away.
 The idea is to appeal to consumers like Ms. Steineger, who think that food grown regionally or produced by eco-friendly operations is fresher and tastes better. For these consumers, knowing the exact farm where food comes from provides comfort about food safety while also allowing them to connect to their communities.
 ''I like to call them the Whole Foods moms,'' said Dan McGowan, president of Big Bowl, a small chain of casual Chinese and Thai food restaurants owned by the Chicago restaurant company Lettuce Entertain You. ''There's a core of people now who don't mind paying an extra quarter or 75 cents if they know it's natural or organic or it's supporting a local person.''
 Mr. McGowan counted on the growing interest in local food when he remade his stir-fry bars at his eight restaurants in Chicago, Minneapolis and Reston, Va. The bars now include as many seasonal, locally grown vegetables as his chefs can find. In Minneapolis, for example, that means using corn from a nearby farm stand, but only when it's in season. 
 Throughout the year, the restaurants offer free-trade coffee, free-range chicken and Niman Ranch pork from pigs raised without hormones or antibiotics on small-scale farms.
 While these three items are not local, Mr. McGowan said they still appealed to people who want sustainable food -- that is, food produced in a way that preserves the health of the land, the health and economic interest of the workers and the farm's bottom line -- and like to know who is producing it.
 The trend driving local food is rooted in the nation's organic movement, which began in the 1930s and got a second life in the 1970s by counterculture farmers. It gained mainstream credibility in 1990 when the Organic Foods Production Act was passed and the Agriculture Department began labeling organic food. 
 To some shoppers, such labels signaled that the products they were buying might be safer or healthier than conventionally produced food. Although some studies have found advantages to organically raised food, especially regarding pesticide residue, environmental impact and increases in certain nutrients, food scientists and farmers still argue the point.
 The nation's appetite for organics has made it the fastest-growing segment in the food industry. At nearly $14 billion in 2005, organic food sales still made up less than 3 percent of the nation's total retail food sales. But that figure represents a 16 percent jump in sales from the year before. The Organic Trade Association, based in Greenfield, Mass., predicts the market will grow 11 percent a year through 2010.
 That success has attracted big players and put an end to organic as a popular shorthand for a certain kind of healthy food grown by progressive farmers. Wal-Mart now sells organic produce, buying some of it from overseas markets like China. Major food manufacturers all offer organic lines, including Frito-Lay, which has a ''natural'' version of Cheetos that uses organic cornmeal.
 When it turned out that several organic brands of bagged spinach, including the popular Earthbound Farms label, were part of the E. coli recall, many consumers had a rude awakening. Although no connection has been made between the outbreak and a specific brand of organic spinach, many people were surprised to learn that Earthbound Farms, a company that began as a small grower of organic produce in Carmel Valley in 1984, had become part of a conglomerate of 185 different growers. The company is now owned by Natural Selection Foods, which operates about 24,000 certified organic acres in the United States, Mexico and New Zealand.
 The idea that organic implied safer was shattered for some consumers. Food grown locally and sustainably suddenly became part of the conversation at the grocery store. 
 ''What we know is that as organic becomes more mainstream, it becomes more diluted in meaning,'' said Laurie Demeritt, president of the Hartman Group, a market research company in Bellevue, Wash., specializing in health and nutrition.
 ''At this point, becoming organic is still a distinction, but as more players get in the marketplace it's not going to be enough,'' she said. ''Producers are going to have to add more attributes, or quality distinctions, and local is certainly part of that.''
 John Mackey, co-founder and chief executive of the 187-store Whole Foods grocery chain, learned that lesson the hard way. After being criticized for making it difficult for local growers to sell in its stores, Whole Foods started acting as a host to weekly farmers' markets of local produce in some of its parking lots. It also set up an annual $10 million loan program to help regional farmers. 
 Even for restaurantgoers, food that is grown sustainably is starting to matter. In the 2007 Zagat restaurant survey, which came out this month, almost three-quarters of residents on the West Coast and a little more than half on the East Coast told researchers they would pay more for food that was raised sustainably. 
 For food evangelists -- consumers who might shop at a co-op or who can explain terms like eco-gastronomy, food miles and the food shed -- a local label is sometimes more important than an organic one. That group, which market researchers say make up about 10 to 15 percent of food shoppers, are most likely to spend time in the store pondering whether an organic pepper from Chile is better than one grown in a nonorganic field less than 250 miles away. 
 They are also the consumers who will influence mainstream shoppers, since the typical consumer has neither the time nor the inclination to untangle the politics of a supply chain when they are buying milk or a loaf of bread. 
 ''It's more about the end product -- Is it healthier? Does it taste better?'' Ms. Demeritt said.
 One attribute that does seem as important is geography. 
 ''Local is important, but also important is the idea of locale,'' she said. ''There is a desire among consumers to support products that are grown, raised or produced in a special or significant place.''
 Jamie Johansson, 38, tends 100-year-old Mission olive trees on 40 acres in Oroville, about an hour's drive north of Sacramento. He now offers his Lodestar Farm olive oil ($17.95 for 16.9 ounces, shipping included) online or through a network of farmers' markets and small grocery stores.
 ''It's great for the family because we can still be farmers instead of salesmen,'' he said. 
 Mr. Johansson and his wife, Nicole, used to sell their olive oil in 75 Northern California stores. He spent all his time driving from retailer to retailer, he said, trying to get on store shelves and service his accounts. Since he switched his approach two years ago, his business has grown considerably, he said, although he is well under $500,000 in sales a year.
 ''It's grass-roots marketing, pure and simple,'' he said. ''People will bring a local gift like olive oil to Wisconsin or Utah so people can understand the place they are from.''
 The rise in farmers' markets can make the difference for him and other regional producers. The markets have become the town squares in many communities and nationally, with the number more than doubling since 1994 to about 3,800, according to the Department of Agriculture. 
 But Mr. Johansson also relies on teaming up with other local producers to increase his reach online. Mr. Johansson is part of a coalition of more than 100 artisanal producers who pay a marketing company, Savor California, to maintain a Web site (savorcalifornia.com) and help them develop their product lines.
 Jane St. Claire began Savor California in 2003 for producers and farmers who were not big enough for most distributors and who, in some cases, had no idea how to take their products to market. On the site, she runs descriptions with the products, typically emphasizing the people behind the product. The strategy plays into a trend that market researchers call ''authenticity.''
 Ms. St. Claire's clients include Bellwether Farms, which was started by Cindy and Ed Callahan, a couple who gave up careers in medicine to raise sheep in Sonoma County, Calif., and make cheese that is now considered some of the best in the country. 
 Although some people interested in local products might not want to buy olive oil that has to be shipped 2,000 miles, others like knowing where their food comes from.
 ''People want that sense of place, whatever that place might be,'' Ms. St. Claire said.
 On a larger scale, the Bon Appetit Management Company has built a $350 million business with local and sustainable food as its calling card. 
 The company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., has a 29-state string of 400 cafes and restaurants, which includes universities, art museums and corporate cafeterias at companies like Oracle, Yahoo and Adidas.
 The chefs must use produce and ingredients from a 150-mile radius in at least 20 percent of the menu. Operations in California and the Pacific Northwest far exceed the goal, while places with shorter growing seasons and fewer farmers have a harder time. Over all, the company spends about $30 million a year on local products. 
 Founded 19 years ago by Fedele Bauccio, Bon Appetit began trying to use more local food in 1999, when Mr. Bauccio got fed up with the taste of the produce coming from his larger suppliers. But the program really took off in 2002, said Maisie Ganzler, director of communications and strategic initiatives.
 The program works because the company threw out a top-down method of menu writing and ordering, abandoned many of their conventional distribution systems and encouraged chefs at each operation to talk to local farmers and create their own sustainable sourcing networks, she said.
 The formula has proved successful, as the company gets requests to bid on more projects than it can handle. And, Ms. Ganzler said, this approach can make the nation's food supply better.
 ''People are really looking for a way to connect these days, and food is a great way to do that,'' she said. ''When you re-elevate the importance of food, and you care where it comes from and what it tastes like, you have to start discussing the issues that surround it.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Small Business special section on Nov. 15 about the effect of food scares on restaurants and other food businesses referred incorrectly to the coffee offered by Big Bowl, a restaurant chain. It is fair-trade coffee, purchased under guidelines designed to promote farmers' economic self-sufficiency, not free-trade coffee.

HEADLINE: Tailoring a Medical Practice to the Area It Serves

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: BENZONIA, Mich. 

 BODY:
EARLY on most days, Rick Nielsen lays down the muddy tools of a cattle producer and puts on the clean white coat of a primary care physician. Dr. Nielsen, 57, whose small farm lies in Benzie County, near the coast of Lake Michigan, is also the co-founder and managing partner of the Crystal Lake Health Center, one of the largest and most financially successful rural health clinics in Michigan. 
 With 41,000 patient visits this year, and revenues exceeding $3.75 million, the clinic has six doctors and 32 other employees, making it one of the county's fastest-growing private employers. At the clinic's main center here, and the three others scattered across the area, new standards in care, technology and business practices are being set, say medical specialists in the region. But the clinic retains a lot of Dr. Nielsen's personality and his respect for small-town ways. Patients still track mud into the waiting rooms, and those who are sick can see a doctor on the same day they call one. 
''We wanted this clinic to be a model for how to care for people in a rural setting,'' Dr. Nielsen said. ''We also wanted to develop and maintain a solid business plan. However you want to look at this, it's different than practicing medicine in a city.''
 When Dr. Nielsen arrived here in the early 1980s, the county's population was about 11,000. The area was so remote geographically that no one thought it unusual that he set up a practice in offices behind the repair bays at the local Chrysler-Plymouth dealer. With one stop, families could get a checkup for their cars and their children. 
 Today Benzie County has about 18,000 residents, and is the second fastest-growing county in Michigan. Like many other rising rural counties in the United States, family incomes are increasing and poverty rates declining. Well-off retirees are flocking here, drawn by the scenic beauty and the comfort in knowing that good medical care is available in Traverse City, Mich., a metropolitan area 30 miles away, and at the Crystal Lake Health Center. 
 In anticipation of the county's transition to a more active center of recreation, retail and commerce, Dr. Nielsen merged his solo practice in 1992 into a partnership with three other doctors to form the clinic. The doctors got technical and financial support from Munson Healthcare, a company that owns and manages a large hospital in Traverse City and a number of small community hospitals in northern Michigan. 
 In its early years the clinic was buffeted by financial problems and internal conflict that caused one of the doctors to set up a competing practice. But in 1995, the clinic got a break when Munson Healthcare negotiated a contract with the clinic's doctors to staff the emergency room at one of its hospitals, Paul Oliver Memorial Hospital, in nearby Frankfort, Mich. This year, that contracts pays the clinic $750,000. 
 ''They've developed a business model that really works for them and for this community,'' said Jim Austin, the administrator at Paul Oliver. ''There was a time there when it was a real struggle for them. But it's become a good example of how success in rural areas comes from cooperation as opposed to competition. Years ago there was a lot of writing about managed competition. The thinking then was that if the payers of health care could set up competition, they could leverage that and health care costs would go down. In fact, in rural areas competition causes costs to go up because the population of patients in rural areas is not what it is in urban areas.''
 The financial focus of any medical practice, whether in a city or rural area, is to retain existing patients and attract new ones. Dr. George Ryckman, an osteopath and a clinic partner, said the number of patient visits is rising because the clinic embraced a systematic approach to its management. 
 First, the partners agreed on three goals: excellent patient care, business profitability and maintaining a high quality of life for themselves and the staff. Dr. Ryckman is an avid fly fisherman and a golfer, and opportunities to do both are ample in the county. 
 Second, the partners agreed on how to achieve their goals. They embarked on an ambitious project to build clinics closer to patients, investing $3.4 million for four large clinics, three in Benzie County, and one in neighboring Manistee County. The buildings are owned by Dr. Nielsen and his partners, who formed a limited liability corporation.
 To control staff expenses and increase efficiency, productivity and profitability, the partners spent more than $250,000 on software, computers and training to digitize medical records and files. The electronic records system has produced a nearly paperless office, said Deb Gatrell, the clinic's administrator, who noted that it also cut in half the number of clerical staff needed to do the billing. The system also eliminated the need to employ two people in every office to pull and file records. Those employees are now engaged in other work, she said. 
 Third, the clinic has been able to recruit younger doctors, including a family practitioner trained by the Navy who arrived three years ago, and a pediatrician who began work earlier this year.
 In many ways, the clinic embodies what Congress envisioned when it passed the Rural Health Clinic Services Act of 1977. The legislation was intended to improve health care in places where doctors were scarce, and to promote a new model of delivery that used nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other primary care specialists. The principal financial incentive was a special payment system that enabled federally qualified rural health clinics to receive extra Medicare and Medicaid payments. 
 In Michigan, for example, Medicaid pays a city doctor $35 for a patient's office visit; it pays a rural health clinic doctor up to $72.76 for an office visit. Similar differentials also exist for office visits by Medicare patients. Though Medicaid and Medicare payments to rural health clinics represent less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the total $622 billion that the federal government paid in 2005, they are a significant economic factor in keeping rural health clinics open. Half the revenue of the Crystal Lake Health Center comes from Medicaid and Medicare patients, Dr. Nielsen said. 
 ''The idea of the payment concept is that rural health clinics are going to see a lot more patients seeking regular office visits and not seeking specialized care,'' said Bill Finerfrock, executive director of the National Association of Rural Health Clinics, a trade group in Fremont, Mich., and Washington. ''Rural health clinics can stay in business because they are assured of an enhanced payment for that office visit.'' 
 The pact between government and doctors has worked so well that 3,200 rural health clinics now exist in the United States, compared with 580 in 1990, Mr. Finerfrock said. According to a recent survey by the association, the average clinic employs a doctor, a physician assistant and three or four other people; oversees 7,200 patient visits annually; and in 2003 earned an average of $641,683. To keep certification as a rural clinic, federal rules require that clinics be audited annually and that full-time doctors handle at least 4,200 patient visits annually. 
 Such a patient load is pretty standard in family medicine, though doctors working for certified rural health clinics are barred from earning more than what the government considers a ''reasonable'' salary. Typically that means doctors earn $130,000 to $160,000 annually, said David James, an accountant and chief financial officer of North American Healthcare Management Services, a company in St. Louis that provides financial services to rural clinics in 25 states. 
 Dr. Nielsen and his colleagues say they are satisfied with their schedules, earnings and interactions with patients. It shows throughout the clinic. Patients rarely wait more than 10 minutes to see a doctor. Waiting rooms in all four clinics look like living rooms, to make patients feel comfortable. 
 In recent years national surveys of doctors have found deep reservoirs of frustration with rising costs, paperwork, billing, litigation and limits on time they can spend with patients. A study published in 2001 in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found that over all doctors were much less satisfied in every aspect of their professional lives than they were in 1986.
 But a similar survey of doctors at the clinic would likely show a different picture. Dr. Nielsen, for instance, spends 20 hours a week in the clinic, and is on-call one night a week and one weekend every six weeks. The other doctors work more hours, particularly Dr. Ryckman and two colleagues who staff the emergency room three nights a week. In other words, the clinic's practitioners work hard, but by no means is this the fabled image of the frantic country doctor.
 ''Physicians in urban areas would probably not accept their level of profitability, their salary level,'' said Mr. Austin, the hospital administrator. ''It's lower than what doctors in cities generally earn. But a lot of doctors from urban areas would welcome the quality of the interaction they have with patients and their quality of life. They've found the right mix that drives their satisfaction.''

HEADLINE: From Silk Road to Supermarket, China's Fragrant Pears 

BYLINE: By DAVID KARP

 BODY:
JADE-GREEN Fragrant pears, with exotic provenance and a legendary reputation, have arrived in the United States for the first time after a journey that evokes Marco Polo. 
 The pears, as crisp as Asian pears but juicy and sweet like more familiar varieties, originated in far western China in the Xinjiang region. The area accounts for only 3 percent of China's pear crop, but the Fragrant variety, which its farmers have cultivated for 1,300 years, is esteemed as the country's finest, and fetches twice the price of other pears there.
The Fragrant pears, which have been exported to the United States since last month, are grown around Korla, a stop on the ancient Silk Road that is now an oil boomtown with more than 420,000 residents. West of the Gobi Desert and north of the Taklimakan Desert, Korla draws water from the Konqi or Peacock River, which flows south from the Tian Shan Mountains. 
 In recent decades Chinese government policy and market reforms have encouraged farmers to sharply increase pear production, which is expected to reach 12.5 million metric tons this year, more than two-thirds of the world's supply. Virtually all are Asian pears, crunchy and ripe off the tree, not the European kind, such as Bartlett and Bosc, which develop their desired buttery texture and rich flavor after harvest.
 Fragrant pears are fairly small and roughly oval, with long stems. The light green or yellow skin, with a reddish blush on some fruits, is thin and readily edible; the flesh is extraordinarily tender, crisp and juicy. The flavor is delicate, and different from that of most Asian pears, with a whiff of the ''pear ester,'' ethyl decadienoate, which gives European varieties their characteristic aroma. Ready to eat after harvest in September, they can keep in commercial storage for up to a year.
 Xinjiang lies at the intersection of the ranges of Asian pears -- which are mostly grown in China, Korea and Japan -- and European pears, which evolved later in the Caucasus Mountains and Asia Minor. The botanical identity of Fragrant pears has long been unclear, and Chinese trade documents describe them as resembling the European species. In a study published in 2001, however, scientists analyzed the variety's molecular markers and determined that it is a complex hybrid of the two main European and Asian species, along with Pyrus armeniacifolia, a little-known Xinjiang species with small fruits and leaves similar to apricot foliage.
 Xinjiang's political situation is unsettled, as an influx of Han, China's main ethnic group, has fed separatist agitation and terrorism by the mostly Muslim Uighurs, who are now a minority in their homeland. Korla has long been renowned for its fruit -- melons and grapes, as well as pears -- and the Chinese government has sought to relieve economic pressures by promoting exports. 
 Chinese officials asked to export Fragrant pears to the United States in 1993, but American pear growers raised concerns that the imported fruit might introduce exotic plant pests and diseases. Only after repeated visits by Department of Agriculture scientists, pest risk assessments and revisions of inspection procedures did the department grant approval last December.
 The only other Chinese pear allowed in the United States is the Yali (Ya) pear, or duck pear, a major commercial variety that is durable but mediocre, with tough flesh and bland flavor. 
 Jacky Chan, managing partner of YW International, a fruit importer, traveled to Korla twice this year to arrange for shipments of Fragrant pears.
 ''If I didn't go, they wouldn't have sent us the best quality,'' he said in an interview in his office in South El Monte, Calif., east of Los Angeles.
 The lengthy journey taken by Fragrant pears may not endear them to environmentally conscious shoppers concerned with food miles. Mr. Chan, 29, said that workers at the packing house in Korla use air guns to clean the pears of insects and debris, check them with magnifying glasses, and then cushion them in tissue paper and foam mesh sleeves for the journey ahead: seven days by truck, over small roads as well as highways, to Shenzhen, a port near Hong Kong; two weeks by container ship to Long Beach, Calif.; and another five days by truck to New York.
 Several other importers are bringing in the pears, which are available at grocery chains including Hong Kong Supermarkets in New York, 99 Ranch Markets in California and H-E-B stores in Texas; they are also expected to show up soon at fancy New York markets such as Agata & Valentina and Dean & DeLuca.
 Knowing that Fragrant pears would soon arrive from China, John M. Wells, co-owner of Viewmont Orchards, in Hood River, Ore., visited China in 2004 and brought back cuttings of the variety, which he intends to propagate and plant next spring.
 ''I'm trying to figure out whether the tree will grow here,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Prices Fell Sharply In October

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Wholesale prices fell at a record rate last month as two economic forces that rarely move in the same direction -- the costs of gasoline and light trucks -- both plunged.
 The new statistics, released yesterday by the Labor Department, added to a growing pool of economic data that showed inflation was easing. For investors focused on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates, the news suggested that rates would remain stable, with some predicting that a cut in borrowing costs might even come as early as March.
 The report, along with comments yesterday from a Fed official that the central bank's policy on interest rates has been ''about right,'' helped touch off a late rally on Wall Street. 
 The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index closed at its highest level in six years, and the Dow Jones industrial average broke another record.
 Consumer spending is showing signs of slowing but remains robust. The Commerce Department said yesterday that retail sales in October, apart from gasoline, rose 0.4 percent, suggesting that many Americans are going into the holiday season in a good mood from the savings they are reaping from lower fuel prices. Wholesale prices as measured by the producer price index, a seasonally adjusted gauge of the prices businesses charge one another just before they are sold to consumers, fell 1.6 percent in October, matching the steepest decline on record, set in 2002.
 The core wholesale inflation rate, a measure that does not take into account the frequent gyrations in energy and food prices, declined 0.9 percent last month, its biggest fall in 13 years.
 The overall picture of wholesale inflation last month was heavily colored by plummeting prices for light trucks, which include sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans, and declining oil prices. Light truck prices fell 12.4 percent, the biggest year-over-year decline since the Labor Department began tracking them in 1964. The price of wholesale gasoline dropped 18.5 percent from October 2005 to October 2006.
 Still, even if the decline in vehicle prices had not been so steep, wholesale inflation in October would have been low. When the core rate is recalculated without automobile sales, wholesale prices rose 0.1 percent.
 ''There's evidence that with energy prices falling and with the slowdown in the housing market, there's a picture of more benign price increases emerging,'' said Peter Kretzmer, an economist at Bank of America. ''I don't think it will be that long before this starts to translate into somewhat muted consumer price trends.''
 Whether falling prices at the producer level eventually lead to falling prices for consumers is never as direct as it might seem. But some economists found it encouraging that yesterday's report was the second consecutive set of wholesale price data to show an overall decline. In September, wholesale prices fell 1.3 percent. For the year, prices are down 1.6 percent.
 Pressure continued to ease further up the production chain. Prices of crude goods -- items in the earliest stages of production, like gravel, scrap metal or animals used for slaughter -- fell 10.5 percent in October after declining 3.4 percent in September. Prices of intermediate goods declined 1.1 percent.
 The falling costs of materials could help reduce the threat of inflation from rising labor costs. One critical question Fed policy makers must answer as they chart the nation's monetary policy is whether the recent wage gains -- which have just started to outpace inflation -- are pressuring employers to pass along the cost by raising prices.
 ''The issue is what happens with labor,'' said Jack Caffrey, an equity strategist with J. P. Morgan Private Bank. ''If the Fed then remains with their focus on inflation risks being the dominant issue, it likely stays with a tighter monetary policy for longer.''
 William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said yesterday that the Fed could go either way. ''I believe that the outlook for Fed policy is roughly symmetrical,'' he said after giving a speech in Wilmington, Del. ''I can imagine data coming in that would make me want to tighten policy. And I could imagine data coming in that would lead me to believe that we ought to be easing policy.''
 Economists said the tipping point for the Fed to lower rates could come if the labor market shows signs of weakening. Last month, unemployment fell to 4.4 percent, the lowest level since May 2001. That is close to what economists consider full employment, and some experts have said they think the number of jobless will rise in the coming months.
 ''People will debate how quickly before the Fed pulls the trigger, and how much weakening you need,'' said James O'Sullivan, an economist at UBS. ''But if we start to see the unemployment rate edge up, I think it's just a matter of time before the Fed starts easing.''

HEADLINE: Ford Profits for a Few Years Are Revised Higher 

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Nov. 14 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company fared better in the first half of this decade than its own original statements had led everyone to believe, but analysts have growing doubts about how quickly the automaker can return to profitability.
 In restating five years of results Tuesday to correct accounting errors, Ford disclosed that its earnings during that period were $850 million higher than previously reported.
The company said, however, that it expects to lose about $1 billion or more in each of the next two years before earning a profit of several hundred million dollars in 2009. 
 To achieve that profit, Ford said its share of the United States market must stabilize at 14 percent to 15 percent, a level that analysts said could be difficult to achieve, particularly as Ford cuts back on sales to rental-car agencies and other fleet operators. In the last three years, Ford's market share has fallen from about 20 percent to about 16 percent.
 Ford's restructuring plan, which it calls the Way Forward, originally projected a return to profitability in 2008. But when executives modified the plan eight months later, in September, to accelerate cost-cutting, they conceded that the company would not return to the black until 2009. Tuesday was the first time the company gave an indication of the likely level of those profits.
 After Ford's chief financial officer, Don R. Leclair, outlined the company's intended path in a conference call on Tuesday, analysts questioned whether the plan was too optimistic, considering the intense competition in the industry and a rapidly changing vehicle market. Ford shares fell a penny, to $8.79.
 ''This thin sliver of profit that's expected in 2009, given how much volatility there is in this sector and around all these assumptions, I don't know that that's very confidence-inspiring unless there was another layer to come,'' said Robert Barry, an automotive analyst with Goldman Sachs in New York.
 Mr. Leclair said: ''We're trying to reflect our views of the uncertainty in the marketplace. We're not going to be committing to a large profit level now.''
 Ford is expected to lose nearly $10 billion this year, although special charges related to its restructuring account for roughly half that amount. General Motors lost $10.6 billion last year but in 2006 has posted an operating profit for three consecutive quarters.
 Through the first nine months of this year, Ford lost $6.99 billion, according to its restated results, an improvement of $253 million from the figure it reported last month. The changes were related to interest rate swaps at the automaker's finance arm, the Ford Motor Credit Company. Ford maintains that its use of the swaps was sound but acknowledges incorrectly applying a complex and relatively new accounting principle.
 The mistakes caused Ford to inflate profits by $1.29 billion from 2003 to 2005 and to underreport its earnings in 2001 and 2002 by $2.52 billion. It overstated retained earnings of $17.26 billion as of Dec. 31, 2000, by $629 million.
 Mr. Leclair said that Ford recognized its challenges and said the plant closings and thousands of job cuts it had scheduled were only part of its plans to reduce expenses. Cost cuts have become ''a way of life for us'' and will continue into the foreseeable future, he said.
 In an interview Tuesday after the conference call, Mr. Leclair said he realized ''it's going to be hard to satisfy people'' that profits will return in 2009 until the company shows more progress in its turnaround plan, and that will not happen right away.
 ''The fourth quarter and the first half of next year are going to be tough,'' he said.
 Mr. Leclair said Ford was close to announcing whether it would borrow money secured by its assets, which it has never done before, to help execute its turnaround plan.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Economic Growth Slows Among Nations Using Euro

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
The economies of the 12 nations that use the euro grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, slowing from the second quarter, the European Union statistics agency Eurostat said. Quarter-on-quarter growth for the entire 25-country European Union was 0.6 percent, it said, putting Europe slightly ahead of the United States, where the economy grew 0.4 percent. There were wide differences within Europe, however, with France reporting zero growth after 1.2 percent expansion in the spring. Germany, Europe's largest economy, grew 0.6 percent, down from 1.1 percent in the second quarter. Italy was also down, growing just 0.3 percent after 0.6 percent in the second quarter.

HEADLINE: Europe Seeks New Controls On Emissions From Airliners 

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
In a move to raise the stakes in global environmental policy, the European Commission said on Tuesday that it would seek to impose emissions controls on all flights in and out of Europe, according to a draft of a proposed law. 
 The proposed policy could drive a wedge between Europe and its trading partners, who are wary that the push for tighter standards could mean higher costs for carriers. The United States government, along with many airlines, favors a global system that avoids regional variations. They are likely to bristle at the prospect of a costly new regulation on carriers. 
Because global agreement on emissions controls would probably take a long time to achieve, European officials are determined to push forward their own. Foreign-based carriers serving high-traffic destinations like London and Paris would be forced to operate under the new rules.
 Under the proposal, airlines would have to meet emissions targets by Jan. 1, 2011, for all flights in and out of Europe. To encourage other countries to introduce similar measures, the union would drop its emissions requirements covering the return leg of a round-trip flight if those countries also adopted pollutions caps for
 airlines.
 ''This European proposal is something we and our industry are watching very, very closely,'' said Tim Smith, a spokesman for American Airlines in Fort Worth. 
 Abigail Moore, a spokeswoman for British Airways, said by e-mail message that Europe should pare the proposal to cover only flights within the union. As it stands, she said the proposal would ''risk international disputes and could lead to retaliation by non-E.U. countries.'' 
 The proposal draws from the principles of an established system that Europe now uses to help combat global warming and meet emissions targets set forth under the Kyoto Protocol. Under that plan, which has so far exempted airlines, governments allocate carbon dioxide emissions targets for producers of power, cement, fuels, pulp and paper. Companies must then purchase allocations, or credits, if they exceed those targets.
 Europe is expected to make its proposals public before the new year; the proposal is likely to face intense opposition in the United States, which could delay approval. 
 Stavros Dimas, the European Union's commissioner for the environment, could also amend the proposal before Europe's governments examine it. Opposition from industries and others is already mounting.
 ''Non-European countries, including the U.S., believe that unilateral imposition of emissions trading requirements absent mutual agreement between nations violates international law. Air carriers have dramatically improved their fuel efficiency and trading obligations are unnecessary to spur continued improvement," said David A. Castelveter, vice president of the Air Transport Association of America. 
 Airline officials warn that proposed emission-control measures could mean higher costs for passengers, who already face frustrations and delays because of increased security checks. The officials also say that aviation accounts for 2 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in Europe.
 Barbara Helfferich, a spokeswoman for Mr. Dimas, the environmental commissioner, declined to comment on the draft ahead of presentation on or around Dec. 20.
 The plan covers only carbon emissions. But Europe also recommends separate legislation regulating another pollutant, nitrogen oxides. The amount of these pollutants could rise, even as jet engines are designed to cut down on carbon dioxide.
 If governments fail to regulate nitrogen oxides through special airport charges, Europe warns that it will start charging for these pollutants, as well, by raising costs to airlines as they seek to meet their carbon allowances.
 ''A pragmatic and precautionary approach is required,'' the draft law states. Under the proposal, airlines would buy 10 percent of their credits through an auction system for the first two years of the program; the other 90 percent would be distributed free. Then, starting in 2013, airlines would be obliged to buy 20 percent of their credits; and starting in 2018, that amount would rise to 40 percent in order to discourage airlines from selling unused credits to improve their profits.
 Each European government would manage emissions targets for carriers in its country. The governments would also be responsible for foreign-based airlines that use their airports most frequently.

HEADLINE: Voters Back Limits On Eminent Domain

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Voters showed last week that the furor over a 2005 Supreme Court decision in a Connecticut eminent domain case has not abated, even in states that have already enacted legislation to restrict the use of condemnation for economic development.
 Ballot measures to limit eminent domain powers to public uses were approved by large margins in eight states. Louisiana passed an eminent domain measure in September.
In all, 34 states have adopted laws or passed ballot measures in response to the Connecticut case, Kelo v. New London, which upheld the right of local officials to require the forced sale of homes and businesses for private development intended to increase the tax base of one of the state's poorest cities. 
 ''A message has been sent that state and local governments have to do a better job of justifying a need for eminent domain,'' said Larry Morandi, a land-use specialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures. ''There needs to be more negotiation and more transparency.'' 
 Donald J. Borut, the executive director of the National League of Cities, acknowledged that condemnation powers are sometimes abused. But he said that property-rights groups have played to public fears in a way that discourages thoughtful discussion about how individual rights should be balanced against projects that benefit the community as a whole. He described anti-Kelo sentiment as ''a huge emotional tsunami that's been rushing through the country.''
 Of the measures approved by voters, ''about half of them are purely procedural or largely symbolic,'' said John D. Echeverria, the executive director of the Georgetown Environmental Law and Policy Institute. In Florida, for example, the State Legislature, by a three-fifths vote of each house, can make an exception to a ban on transferring condemned property from one private entity to another. 
 Strict constitutional amendments have been added in South Carolina and Georgia -- states where eminent domain is not used for economic development, said Timothy Sandefur, a staff lawyer for the Pacific Legal Foundation, a libertarian group that represents property owners in condemnation cases.
 But in Michigan, where officials are trying to cope with decades of disinvestment in cities like Detroit and Flint, a new constitutional amendment is likely to have a ''chilling effect on the willingness of investors to undertake new development,'' said John E. Mogk, a law professor at Wayne State University. 
 Though property-rights groups cheered last week's election results, their victory was tempered by the failure -- except in Arizona -- of initiatives aimed at discouraging government officials from making zoning and other land-use decisions. California, Idaho and Washington State defeated initiatives to require compensation for owners of property that lost value as a result of a government action to restrict its use. 
 That the measure was rejected by three-fourths of the voters in Idaho, considered a strong property-rights state, suggests that the movement against so-called regulatory takings is doomed, said David Barron, a Harvard Law School professor. ''It shows that the people recognize that the property-rights movement is potentially just divesting them of their ability to decide their own future as a community,'' he said. ''People don't want that to happen.'' 
 In Oregon, which passed a similar measure in 2004, local officials have waived zoning rules to avoid paying nearly $6 billion to compensate property owners who claimed economic losses. 
 But California's eminent domain and antizoning initiative lost by only four percentage points after opponents put together a huge coalition that included antitax groups concerned about the potential cost of compensating property owners for land-use changes. 
 The California measure was one of eight propositions on ballots throughout the country backed by groups linked to Howard S. Rich, a New York real estate investor. In Arizona, where the measure was one of 19 on the ballot, the proponents outspent the opponents 4 to 1, according to The Arizona Republic. The situation was reversed in California, where proponents were outspent 3 to 1, said John F. Shirey, the executive director of the California Redevelopment Association, a trade group.
 California has already tinkered with its eminent domain powers, but Mr. Shirey said the state should take further steps -- like passing legislation to prevent the condemnation of single-family homes -- to head off future property-rights initiatives. ''We need to do something substantive to give people better assurances than they have now that something like what occurred in Connecticut couldn't happen in California,'' he said.
 Eminent domain specialists on both sides of the issue say many of the statutes enacted by state legislatures have few teeth, either because the language is vague or the measures impose only minor restrictions on public officials.
 ''A lot of state legislators don't really believe in property rights,'' Mr. Sandefur said. He praised Pennsylvania as one of a handful of states that have enacted a ''well-crafted, careful, thought-out measure,'' but noted that officials could continue condemning property for redevelopment in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh until 2012.
 Mr. Barron, the Harvard Law professor, said much of the legislation was ''more hype than not,'' often riddled with exceptions inserted during the legislative process. Indiana -- another state praised by Mr. Sandefur -- includes technology parks as a ''public use'' for which eminent domain powers can be used. 
 The initiatives approved Nov. 7 tend to be shorter and more restrictive than the bills, ''but there will be a lot of interpretative questions about what they mean,'' Mr. Barron said. 
 Amy S. Doppelt, a managing director at Fitch Ratings, said the initiatives were often unclear. ''Frequently, the language is quite broad,'' she said. ''It creates a lot of uncertainty.'' Communities that can no longer use condemnation could find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, which could ultimately lower their credit rating, she said.
 In many communities, eminent domain powers are used only sparingly. That is not the case in Detroit, where officials have worked to bring industrial parks and middle-income housing developments to tracts of land that are largely, but not entirely, vacant.
 ''Any project requiring an assembly of land of 50 acres or more since 1960 has required eminent domain at some point in order to complete the project,'' said Mr. Mogk, the Wayne State professor.
 But the use of condemnation powers to replace one set of property owners with another has often proved contentious. One such project on the city's east side, now known as Jefferson Village, gave rise to years of lawsuits. But it has proved so successful that the city expects to recoup its $38 million investment in 12 years, said Robbin G. Millard, a project manager for the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, the nonprofit organization that helped create Jefferson Village. Though 160 homes were taken, most owners were able to reach a settlement with the city, he said. 
 In 2004, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that eminent domain could no longer be used for private projects to create jobs and generate tax revenue. That decision is now enshrined in a constitutional amendment approved last week by Michigan voters. If condemnation is used to eliminate blight, each individual property must now be shown to be blighted ''by clear and convincing evidence,'' Mr. Mogk said. This requirement is likely to discourage badly needed development, he said. 
 Mr. Millard said that while some aspects of the amendment need to be clarified, that does not appear to pose insurmountable barriers. Officials will be able to show that the buildings they seek to condemn are blighted. ''We think we can still do eminent domain in this city,'' he said.

 BODY:

FORD'S WAY FORWARD -- The Ford Motor Company expects to lose about $1 billion in each of the next two years before earning a profit of several hundred million dollars in 2009, the company's chief financial officer, Don R. Leclair, said. Ford said its share of the American market must stabilize at 14 to 15 percent -- from just above 16 percent -- to achieve that profit. Leclair said the forecast for a small profit in 2009 reflects ''the uncertainty in the marketplace'' [Page C4] 


CHINA BANKS -- The career of a senior risk adviser hired by the China Construction Bank to assess its bad loans was contentious and short. The banker was fired in July after he told top executives that up to $3 billion in bad loans might have been intentionally hidden from outside auditors, just months before the bank's sale of stock to public investors. The bank strongly denies the assertions. The dispute provides a glimpse into China's troubled banking system. [C1]

PRODUCER PRICE DROP -- Wholesale prices fell 1.6 percent in October, matching the steepest decline on record, set in 2002. The figures added to a growing pool of economic data showing that inflation is easing. For investors focused on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates, the news suggested that a rate cut might not be far off. [C1]

STOCKS SURGE -- Investors responded to the inflation news by pushing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its highest level in six years. The Dow Jones industrials climbed further into record territory. [C9]

TRADE BILLS IN DOUBT -- Prospects for Congressional approval of several free trade bills backed by the administration were thrown into doubt when House Republican leaders abruptly withdrew the one aimed at Vietnam on the eve of President Bush's trip there this week. The failure of the Vietnam bill was a disappointment and embarrassment for the White House. [C3]

METS IMPACT ON CITIGROUP -- Call it the curse of the ball field. If it holds, Citigroup stock is going to underperform for years to come. Citigroup agreed to pay an amount reported at more than $400 million over 20 years to place the name Citi Field on the New York Mets stadium that will open in 2009. History shows, however, that stocks of banks with ball parks have tended to do worse than stocks of other banks, and teams in such parks have tended to lose more games than they win. Market Place. [C1]

SAN DIEGO FRAUD CHARGES -- The city of San Diego settled fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the first time the commission has sanctioned a local government. The S.E.C. found that from 2002 to 2003, San Diego misled investors and credit rating agencies about the amount of money it had promised to retired city workers and how the promises might threaten its ability to repay the bonds. [C3]

HEALTHY FOOD ADVERTISING -- Ten of the largest food and beverage manufacturers -- including General Mills, McDonald's and Coca-Cola -- said that at least half of their advertising directed at children under the age of 12 would promote healthier foods or contain messages that encourage healthy lifestyles. [C3]

FLIGHT EMISSION CONTROLS -- The European Commission said that it would seek to impose emission controls on all flights in and out of Europe, according to a draft of a proposed law. The proposed policy could drive a wedge between Europe and some of its trading partners, who are wary that the push for tighter standards could mean higher costs for carriers. [C8]

SHAKE-UP AT NBC Randy Falco, the president of the NBC Universal Television Group, is in talks to leave his position as the No. 2 executive at the television group to take a senior operating role at AOL, according to executives briefed on the move. Mr. Falco, two people briefed on the discussions said, is considering the position because it represents a chance to run his own business after more than three decades at NBC. [C1]

LIBEL JUDGEMENT -- In a case that media lawyers say has broad implications for press freedoms, a jury in Geneva, Ill. found that a newspaper columnist falsely and maliciously wrote in 2003 that the chief justice of the Illinois State Supreme Court had traded his vote for a political favor. The jury, in a civil trial, awarded the justice $7 million. [A18]

PHARMACY SETTLEMENT -- Omnicare, the largest provider of pharmacy services to nursing homes in the United States, said that it had agreed to pay $49.5 million to settle claims by the federal government and 42 states that it overcharged them for drugs provided to senior citizens. Lawyers involved in the case said Omnicare substituted drugs in order to evade price limits for Medicaid reimbursement. [C4]

HEADLINE: Charmin to New York: 'Go in Style' 

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
NEVER stand when you can sit, and never pass up a chance to go to the bathroom. 
 It's the kind of oft-repeated advice that New Yorkers find useless. In Manhattan, chances to get rid of that morning coffee are few and far between.
But the search for relief is about to ease, at least for the 15.3 million people who the New York Travel Advisory Bureau predicts will visit New York over the holidays. From next Monday through Dec. 31, the Procter & Gamble Charmin brand will operate a public restroom in the heart of Times Square, amply stocked with Charmin Ultra, and complete with attendants who are assigned to clean up after each use. 
 ''Let's face it -- there aren't a lot of environments where a bathroom tissue message is relevant,'' said Dennis Legault, brand manager for Charmin. ''But the message is very relevant when people really need to go.''
 The 20-stall restroom will be at 1540 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, in space formerly occupied by a bar, Bar Code. It will be open from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. (except for Christmas Day, when it will close at 6 p.m.). Two of the stalls will be accessible to people with disabilities, and baby changing stations will be available. There will also be a seating lounge, with its own photo-op: A six-foot stuffed Charmin bear, just waiting to have its picture taken with a visitor.
 It is not on street level, but it will be hard to miss. Charmin representatives will be roaming the Times Square streets dressed as toilets, handing out fliers advertising the restroom's location. Electronic billboards at local airports will announce it, too, and Charmin will prominently post the location on its Web site. Doris Roberts, Raymond's mom on ''Everyone Loves Raymond,'' has agreed to do the ceremonial first flush on Monday.
 A huge billboard over the door to the restroom itself will say ''You are in New York. Go in Style.'' Right under that will be a sign saying Charmin Restroom.
 ''Think of it as our holiday gift to New York,'' Mr. Legault said.
 Brand specialists say it is actually New York's holiday gift to Charmin. ''Really, how often do you get to introduce your product in a one-on-one fashion, to a highly motivated audience that is almost certain to respond with gratitude?'' said James R. Gregory, chief executive of the brand consulting firm CoreBrand.
 Charmin first tested the idea of free bathrooms in 2000, when it refurbished a restroom at the Ohio State Fair. ''It was a way to try the idea without investing lots of money,'' Mr. Legault said.
 Follow-up research showed that there was a definite increase in Charmin's sales, and that even three months later, people remembered the Potty Palooza, as Charmin calls its spiffed-up johns. The research showed that people even stayed longer at the fair. ''In the past, they stayed as long as their bladders held out,'' Mr. Legault said. 
 But a Times Square restroom is a bigger gamble for Charmin. This is the first time the brand will operate a restroom for longer than a few days. And, since Times Square gets visitors from all over the world, it will be hard to check whether the restroom has pumped up Charmin's image, let alone its sales. Charmin representatives at the site will try to talk to visitors as they go out, even get e-mail addresses or phone numbers so they can contact them down the road. Still, Mr. Legault concedes, ''evaluating this is going to be a challenge.'' 
 Mr. Legault declined to discuss budget, except to say that the restroom is second only to television advertising among this year's promotional costs. 
 Neither Charmin nor Vornado, the real estate company that owns the space, would divulge what Charmin is paying in rent. But upstairs retail space in the area goes for $150 to $225 a square foot per year, and the restroom will occupy from 7,000 to 8,000 square feet. 
 Cost, in fact, was the main thing keeping Charmin from doing this sooner. ''Real estate is so expensive in New York, we just couldn't be sure the economics would work,'' Mr. Legault said. ''But we know that New York is the center of the universe, so we just had to give it a try.'' 
 Branding experts say it is money well spent. ''This will provide a much-needed service for women, who I suspect are Charmin's main buyers,'' said Judy Hopelain, a partner at the marketing consultant Prophet Brand Strategy.
 Michael Watras, president of the brand consultant Straightline International, figures that the costs, no matter how high, are a pittance for what the promotion will glean. ''They're showcasing their brand to a gazillion people in the toughest place in the toughest city,'' he said. ''They'll get more publicity than any advertising campaign could ever provide.''
 Still, it is not a risk-free approach. If those attendants fall down on the cleaning job, or if the lines at the restroom are too long, there could be a backlash, the branding specialists said. And, when Charmin closes the Potty Palooza at year-end, gratitude could quickly become resentment. ''When you introduce something that people like, it's never a good idea to take it away,'' Mr. Gregory warned.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Are Lower, but Beat Expectations

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Retail sales in the United States fell less than expected in October as increases in purchases of food and autos helped make up for a decline in gasoline sales. 
 Sales fell 0.2 percent after a revised 0.8 percent decline in September, which was twice as large as originally reported, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Purchases excluding gasoline rose 0.4 percent last month.
''This shows consumers are hanging in there but not showing outsized exuberance,'' said Anthony Chan, chief economist at J. P. Morgan Private Client Services in New York. ''It paints a picture of a moderating economy.''
 Economists expected retail sales to fall 0.4 percent in October, matching the previously reported decline in September. 
 Sales excluding autos fell 0.4 percent after a 1.2 percent drop. Sales excluding autos were projected to decline 0.2 percent after a previously reported drop of 0.5 percent.
 Sales at automobile dealerships and parts stores rose 0.6 percent last month after rising 0.7 percent the prior month, the report said. Excluding autos and gasoline, overall sales rose 0.3 percent in October, the same as in the prior month.
 Sales at gasoline stations fell 6 percent in October after an 11 percent drop in September. While lower prices at the pump pulled down sales at service stations, they left consumers more money to spend on other goods.
 Stores selling building materials and garden supplies showed a 0.3 percent decrease in sales last month, after falling 1.8 percent in September. Sales of electronics and appliances were unchanged after rising 0.1 percent the month before.

HEADLINE: Banks Shouldn't Name Ball Fields. You Can Look It Up.

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Call it the curse of the ball field. If it holds, Citigroup stock is going to underperform for years to come.
 Citigroup became the fifth banking company to buy naming rights to a Major League Baseball stadium when it agreed Monday to pay an amount reported at more than $400 million over 20 years to place the name Citi Field on the New York Mets stadium that will open in 2009.
Citigroup obviously thinks that the naming rights are valuable, but history does not indicate such deals have done much for other banks, or for the ball clubs that play in them. Stocks of banks with ballparks have tended to do worse than stocks of other banks, and teams in these parks have tended to lose more games than they win. 
 It can be argued that none of this has anything to do with reality, that teams win or lose based on the quality of their players, not the name on the park, and that bank stocks go up or down because of their profits, not because of what in most cases is a relatively small part of their merchandising budget. 
 Those arguments are probably correct, but things have still not gone well when banks name ballparks. It is at least possible that there is no competitive advantage for a bank in having its name on a stadium. Maybe customers would prefer better service or higher deposit rates or lower loan rates, rather than receive the prestige of having the same name that is on their checks also on the ball field of their favorite team. 
 Or perhaps fans of other teams are reluctant to do business with a bank with such visible ties to a team that is out to defeat their favorite club. That could be important in New York, where many Yankee fans do not like the Mets.
 Bank-named ballparks have not done that well for the teams, either. Cumulatively, there have been 25 seasons played in bank-named ballparks, but the home team has managed to post winning records in only 9 of those seasons. The average record in bank-named ballparks has been 75 wins and 87 losses. 
 Bank teams are not unique. There seems to be a pattern that industries that name multiple baseball parks do not do very well in picking winners. The only industry with a winning record this year was the phone industry, with AT&T Park in San Francisco, Rogers Center in Toronto and U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago, where the White Sox play.
 The beer business (Colorado, St. Louis and Milwaukee), the insurance industry (Seattle and Cincinnati) and the juice business (Tampa Bay and Houston) all lost more regular-season games than they won. That was true even though the St. Louis Cardinals won the World Series. 
 The first bank to put its name on a baseball stadium was Bank One, which named Bank One Stadium in 1998, the year the Arizona Diamondbacks began playing, with a 65-97 record. That park is now Chase Field, recognizing Bank One's 2004 merger with J. P. Morgan Chase.
 From the time that naming deal was announced through Monday, when the Citigroup deal was announced, a Bank One investor would have seen his stock rise 111 percent, a performance that seems great until it is compared with that of the KBW bank stock index, which leaped 296 percent over the period. The Diamondbacks did win a World Series in 1999, but they have a losing record for their entire franchise history. 
 The next up to bat was Comerica, which named the new stadium for the Detroit Tigers in 2000. The team responded by playing only four games below .500, its best record in years, but it was not until last year that it had a winning record, going all the way to the World Series. Since Comerica was granted the naming rights in 1998, its stock is down 10 percent, while the bank index is up 41 percent.
 If the new stadium briefly inspired the Tigers, a similar facility did not do much for the Pittsburgh Pirates when they moved into PNC Park in 2001 and lost 100 games. The team has not done that badly since, but it has yet to post a winning season in the ballpark. PNC stock has almost matched the bank index since the bank won the naming rights, rising 38.7 percent while the index rose 39 percent.
 The fourth bank ballpark is the only one owned by a non-American bank. Citizens Bank Park, in Philadelphia, is named for a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, where baseball is not popular. Nor has the performance of the bank's stock done much to inspire a love for the game. Since it won the naming rights in 2003, its shares have risen 7 percent in British pounds, trailing every other stock in an index of major British banks. It has also lagged the American bank index.
 On the field, however, the Phillies have had winning seasons in all three years that Citizens Bank Park has been open, although the park has yet to play host to a playoff game.
 Over all, someone who put $100 into each bank stock on the day the naming deal was announced would have earned $161 on the $400 investment, not counting dividends. That is not bad, but it is less than half the $377 that could have been made buying the bank stock index. 
 It could be worse. An investor who put $100 into Enron stock when it bought the naming rights to the new Houston Astros stadium in 1999 would have had stock worth 44 cents when the bankrupt company sold back the rights to the team in 2002. 
 That field has remained less than lucky for investors. It was renamed Minute Maid Park for the Coca-Cola juice subsidiary in June 2002. Since then, Coke stock is down 14 percent while the Standard & Poor's 500 is up 30 percent.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 17, 2006

 CORRECTION:
The Market Place column in Business Day on Wednesday, about the performance of banks that buy the naming rights to sports stadiums, and of the ball clubs that play in them, misstated the winner of the 1999 World Series. It was the New York Yankees, not the Arizona Diamondbacks. (Arizona won in 2001.) The column also misstated the former name of the home field for the Diamondbacks. It was Bank One Ballpark, not Bank One Stadium. (It is now Chase Field, reflecting Bank One's merger in 2004 with J.P. Morgan Chase.)

HEADLINE: The Science Of Pricing Great Art

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
By the time the crowd began arriving in Rockefeller Center last Wednesday for the big auction at Christie's, rain had already been falling in New York for 19 consecutive hours. It was one of those blustery rains for which umbrellas were no match, so the assembled art lovers were left to peel off their damp overcoats in Christie's lobby and wait in a long coat-check line.
 Once inside, a few hundred of the attendees were shunted off to one of two side rooms, where they would watch the auction on a video screen, because the 750 seats in the main room -- the James Christie Room -- weren't nearly enough for the crowd.
 Yet none of the inconveniences seemed to dull anybody's enthusiasm. Over the next three hours, a mere sketch by Mondrian sold for $3 million, while a Gauguin painting went for $40 million and a Klimt for $88 million. In all, the auction brought in $491 million, breaking the modern mark of $435 million (in today's dollars) set by Sotheby's in 1990, in the last bull market in art. 
 There is no mystery about the causes of the new boom. The rich have done very well over the last decade, and some of them, including hedge fund managers like Steven A. Cohen, are spending large sums of their money on art. New billionaires in China, India and, above all, Russia, have also entered the market. 
 The mysterious part of the current mania lies in figuring out what exactly makes a piece of art worth $30 million instead of, say, $1 million. Not even people who make their living selling art claim to have much of a definition of great art. In fact, they're proud not to have one. ''That's where the market becomes magical,'' Tobias Meyer, Sotheby's chief auctioneer, told me.
 For the last five years, though, a man named David W. Galenson, an art lover, modest collector and tenured professor of economics at the University of Chicago, has been trying to change this. He has developed something approaching a unified theory of art, which hasn't won him many fans in the art world but does a surprisingly good job of explaining the relative value of the world's great paintings. Even if you know nothing about art, Mr. Galenson can help you understand why Andy Warhol's 1962 ''Orange Marilyn'' is expected to sell for more than his 1972 ''Mao'' at Christie's postwar auction tonight.
 The theory has its roots in a conversation a decade ago between Mr. Galenson and an art dealer he knew. He was thinking about buying an old painting by an American artist named Sol LeWitt and asked the dealer what she thought of the price. She told him the work was overpriced, because recent LeWitt works were selling for less. When Mr. Galenson asked her if the comparison was relevant, she told him that an artist's age didn't determine the price of his work. 
 ''My whole life I've studied the relationship between age and productivity,'' Mr. Galenson, a slight 55-year-old, said last week as we walked through the public viewing before the Christie's auction, ''and she's saying it doesn't matter.''
 So he began collecting data on the sale price of works by Warhol, Jackson Pollock and other American artists, and he discovered a pattern. Most of them produced their most valuable work either very early in their career, like Warhol, or very late, like Pollock. When he expanded his research to European painters, he found the same pattern.
 Not only that, but the two groups tended to approach art, and to talk about it, in strikingly different ways. The young geniuses, like Gauguin, Picasso and Van Gogh, were conceptual innovators whose paintings broke sharply from previous work. They typically had a precise goal in mind when they started a piece and didn't need long to finish it. ''Above all, don't sweat over a painting,'' Gauguin once told a friend. ''A great sentiment can be rendered immediately.''
 The late bloomers, on the other hand, arrived at their innovations gradually, through trial and error, making their major contributions late in life. They painted the same subject again and again, experimenting on the canvas, often reluctant to say that a painting was finished. Consider that Cezanne, who did his most valuable and celebrated work in his 60s, signed few of his paintings. 
 Mr. Galenson has extended the theory to novelists, poets and beyond, arguing that most creative people fall on one end or the other of the spectrum, and he has earned a fair bit of attention. Malcolm Gladwell, in a speech at Columbia University, described ''Old Masters and Young Geniuses,'' which Mr. Galenson published this year, as ''a really wonderful book.'' Wired magazine recently profiled him under the headline, ''What Kind of Genius Are You?''
 But there are also a lot of people who consider him to be a bit of a kook. He has taken arguably the least scientific of all human endeavors and tried to fit it into a grand system. An art critic writing in The Chicago Tribune accused Mr. Galenson of applying statistical analysis to an inherently unquantifiable field and said his work ''reads like a quirky little journal article that blithely ingested steroids.'' As Mr. Galenson himself says: ''The art historians and art critics won't look at my work. They just assume I'm an idiot.''
 When Mr. Gladwell submitted an article about Mr. Galenson's ideas to The New Yorker, he suffered his first rejection from the magazine. ''You buy this Galenson stuff?'' Mr. Gladwell recalled his editor saying to him. ''What are you, crazy?''
 Obviously, Mr. Galenson's theory can't explain all of art history. There are clear exceptions, like ''Guernica,'' which Picasso painted when he was 55, decades after much of his greatest work. 
 But they are exceptions nonetheless. If you look through the prices from the current auction season, or walk through any major museum, you can't help but notice that Mr. Galenson is onto something. When a still life that Cezanne painted at the age of 56, for instance, fetched $37 million at Sotheby's last week, art experts cited the rarity of Cezanne still lifes. The next night at Christie's, another Cezanne still life -- one painted when he was 34 -- sold for just $1.1 million. 
 So I don't think that the exceptions to the Galenson theory of creativity are the main reason it faces so much opposition. Its real problem is that it's not what we want to hear. We like to believe that human judgment is too complex and nuanced -- too magical -- to be captured by something as clinical as statistics. And sometimes it is, but not nearly as often as we imagine. 
 While Mr. Galenson has been studying the art world over the last five years, all sorts of other fields have been engaged in their own debate about judgment versus rules. Some doctors have been resisting a push toward ''evidence-based medicine'' because they believe their clinical judgment trumps the data. In Major League Baseball, scouts who have been watching games for decades roll their eyes at a group of young executives who prefer numbers to descriptions. 
 When the traditionalists in these fields describe their skepticism of statistics, they sometimes make the argument that their craft is as much art as it is science. That's a nice line, but the next time you hear it, think back to Mr. Galenson's work. Even art, it turns out, has a good bit of science to it.

HEADLINE: 'This Is a Test. In the Event of an Actual Earthquake ' 

BYLINE: By DAVID STABA

DATELINE: AMHERST, N.Y., Nov. 14 

 BODY:
An earthquake shook the walls of a two-story house in this suburb of Buffalo late Tuesday morning, sending wine glasses crashing to the floor, flower boxes plunging from second-story windows and a stuffed tiger plummeting from the bookshelf in a child's bedroom.
 The tremor was limited to a single structure built inside a laboratory at the University at Buffalo, intended to simulate the 1994 Northridge quake that shook Los Angeles. The 1,800-square-foot, three-bedroom house was the largest wooden building ever tested on such a simulator, built atop two ''shake plates'' that can be manipulated to resemble the earth's movement. 
The simulated earthquake, set off at 11:37 a.m., had a magnitude of 6.7, which is what the Northridge quake measured.
 Andre Filiatrault, an engineering professor at the university who supervised the test, said it was important to test wooden structures because 80 percent of the nation's buildings are made of wood, including 90 percent of the residential buildings. ''And yet,'' he said, ''we know very little of how they perform in earthquakes.''
 The windows of the house shimmied during the 15-second simulation, but did not break. A station wagon in the garage moved sideways a few inches on the concrete floor. There were a few cracks in the house's stucco siding, but no structural damage was evident.
 ''The structure did very well -- it didn't collapse,'' said John W. van de Lindt, a professor at Colorado State University who is the principal investigator on a four-year national project aimed at improving the safety and economics of wood-frame construction. ''If the contents were correctly anchored, you would have survived in that building, no doubt.''
 The imaginary occupants of the house would not even have had all that much cleaning up to do. In the dining room, a full water pitcher on the table remained full and on the table, while an infant's swing stayed upright. 
 In a bedroom, with T-shirts tacked on the wall from each of the universities involved in the project -- Cornell, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Texas A&M joined Buffalo and Colorado State -- a computer monitor and a television fell to the floor. But in another bedroom, where a child's bookshelf, a television and a dresser were anchored in place as recommended in earthquake zones, the furnishings did not fall. And in the garage, a hot water heater that was secured as required by California law stayed put, while an unsecured one next to it toppled as soon as the test began.
 The house was built to California housing codes, with stucco siding and clay roof shingles more commonly found on the West Coast than in western New York. It had already withstood several smaller test quakes since construction began in June.
 Construction on the house included techniques common since the Northridge earthquake, like using larger washers when bolting a sill plate to the concrete floor to prevent lifting. One of the project's goals was to compare long-term savings on repairs after earthquakes with higher initial construction costs.
 ''We're looking at, 'How do you minimize the cost of the structure over its lifetime?' '' Mr. van de Lindt said. ''If you're the owner, over 40 or 50 years in California, you may go through more than one earthquake. So what can you do? It might cost a little more initially, but then, statistically, we can figure out that it would actually be less expensive over your lifetime.''
 The next step in the project will be analyzing data gathered from the 250 sensors throughout the house to assist in the designing of even larger wooden structures.
 ''Tall buildings, four or five stories, are going up right now in places like the Pacific Northwest, but nobody knows too much about how they'll react in an earthquake,'' Mr. Filiatrault said.
 Researchers plan to design a six-story wooden house to be tested in 2009 on the world's largest earthquake simulator, in Kobe, Japan, site of a devastating quake in 1995.
 Tuesday's test here marked the completion of the first year of the $1.24 million project, which is being financed by the National Science Foundation. Earthquake research has been taking place at the University of Buffalo since the 1960s; the school received $21 million in federal and state financing in 2001 to build the laboratory where the test took place.
 Despite the lack of visible damage to the test house, Mr. Filiatrault said he was unsure whether a similar structure would be immediately habitable after a real quake.
 ''If I was the owner of this house and I was in California, I would probably sleep in the backyard for a couple of nights and get an engineer to check it out,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.N. Says Somalis Helped Hezbollah Fighters 

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
More than 700 Islamic militants from Somalia traveled to Lebanon in July to fight alongside Hezbollah in its war against Israel, a United Nations report says. The militia in Lebanon returned the favor by providing training and -- through its patrons Iran and Syria -- weapons to the Islamic alliance struggling for control of Somalia, it adds. 
 The report, which was disclosed by Reuters on Monday, appears to be the first indication that foreign fighters assisted Hezbollah during the 34-day conflict, when Israel maintained a tight blockade on Lebanon. 
The report also says Iran sought to trade arms for uranium from Somalia to further its nuclear ambitions, though it does not say whether Iran succeeded. 
 The 86-page report was issued by four experts monitoring violations of a 1992 United Nations arms embargo on Somalia, which was put in place after the country lapsed into civil war and remains in effect. The report is to be discussed Friday at the Security Council. 
 The panel does not say how the information was obtained. But the members had access to information from the intelligence agencies of the Security Council's 15 current members, including Britain, France, China, Russia and the United States, a United Nations official said. 
 Any involvement by Somalis would be surprising because Hezbollah's effectiveness is widely attributed to its deep familiarity with the region. 
 Hezbollah officials could not be reached Tuesday night for comment. 
 An official at the Israeli mission to the United Nations said he had not seen the report, and was not aware of any Somali fighters having taken part in the conflict with Hezbollah. The official asked not to be identified, citing diplomatic protocol. 
 While the sources of the information remain unclear, the report is dense with details about arms shipments to the groups vying for power in Somalia. 
 It states that in mid-July, Aden Hashi Farah, a leader of the Somali Islamist alliance, personally selected about 720 combat-hardened fighters to travel to Lebanon and fight alongside Hezbollah. 
 At least 100 Somalis had returned by early September -- with five Hezbollah members -- while others stayed on in Lebanon for advanced military training, the report says. It is not clear how many may have been killed, though the report says some were wounded and later treated after their return to Somalia. 
 The fighters were paid a minimum of $2,000 for their service, the report says, and as much as $30,000 was to be given to the families of those killed, with money donated by ''a number of supporting countries.'' 
 In addition to training some Somali militants, Hezbollah ''arranged for additional support to be given'' by Iran and Syria, including weapons, the report found. On July 27, 200 Somali fighters also traveled to Syria to be trained in guerrilla warfare, the report says.
 It also indicates that Iran appears to have sought help in its quest for uranium in Dusa Mareb, the hometown of Sheik Hassan Dahir Aweys, the leader of the Islamist alliance in Somalia, which is known as the Council of Islamic Courts. 
 ''At the time of the writing of this report, there were two Iranians in Dusa Mareb engaged on matters linked to the exploration of uranium in exchange for arms'' for the Council of Islamic Courts, says the report, which is dated Oct. 16. 
 Those claims, if proved, could worsen global tensions over Iran's nuclear program. Iran ignored an Aug. 31 deadline to suspend its uranium enrichment, and the United States has been leading a United Nations effort to impose sanctions. 
 The United Nations report is focused mostly on the increasingly volatile situation in Somalia, where Islamists took control of the capital, Mogadishu, in June from warlords backed by the United States. 
 Not only has the volume of arms flowing into Somalia grown, according to the authors, but more sophisticated weapons like surface-to-air missiles are being brought in. The conflict could grow into a regional war, with Somalia's neighbors, Ethiopia and Eritrea, backing opposing sides.
 The report also accuses Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Syria of supplying the Somali Islamists with arms, advisers and fighters. It says three nations -- Ethiopia, Uganda and Yemen -- are aligned with the so-called transitional government based in Baidoa, an inland city. 
 Asked about violations of the arms embargo, the report states, officials in those countries either denied any involvement or failed to answer. 
 The report recommends that the Security Council blockade Somalia. It also warns urgently against sending any peacekeepers to the country, saying such a force could become ''the catalyst that sparks a serious military confrontation between the opposing sides.''

HEADLINE: Jury Finds That Columnist Acted With Malice and Awards Judge $7 Million

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: GENEVA, Ill., Nov. 14 

 BODY:
In a case that media lawyers say has broad implications for press freedoms, a jury here found Tuesday that a newspaper columnist falsely wrote in 2003 that the chief justice of the Illinois State Supreme Court had traded his vote for a political favor, and had acted with malice.
 The chief justice, Robert R. Thomas, brought the case against Bill Page, a former columnist for The Kane County Chronicle, a 14,000-circulation daily here, about 40 miles west of Chicago. 
 The jury awarded Justice Thomas $7 million, with $5 million for damaging his reputation, $1 million for future economic losses and $1 million for humiliation. It is the second-largest award in the county's history, after a $21 million medical malpractice award this year, said F. Keith Brown, a circuit judge here. 
 The justice's lawyers said that Mr. Page had essentially accused him of official misconduct, a felony, when he wrote that he had traded his vote on a disciplinary case in exchange for political support for his favored candidate in a local judicial race.
 ''This sends a message to renegade journalists that this conduct will not be tolerated,'' said Joseph A. Power Jr., a lawyer for Justice Thomas.
 The jury deliberated for nine hours. Ken Sotern, 46, a juror and merchandising manager, said that the jury wanted to send a message to the news media ''to a degree,'' but that its main concern was to try to restore Justice Thomas's reputation.
 The newspaper's lawyers said they were handicapped because the trial judge did not allow them to argue that as a columnist, Mr. Page was not held to the standards of a reporter. They said Mr. Page accurately reported information from his unidentified sources.
 The lawyers said the verdict would have a ''chilling effect'' on coverage of public officials and could embolden other judges to file suit, particularly since the award was high.
 Steve Rosenfeld, part of the defense team, said the verdict would most likely be appealed. But he said it would be tricky because Mr. Thomas, 54, a former place-kicker for the Chicago Bears, oversaw all judges, including the trial judge, Donald J. O'Brien Jr., who was brought in from Cook County, and the State Supreme Court justices, most of whom took the stand on his behalf. 
 The case was also significant because it prompted an appellate court to establish a judicial privilege in Illinois, allowing deliberations to be kept private, much like doctor-patient discussions.
 Newspapers are sued frequently, but it is unusual for a judge to sue a newspaper. Of 397 complaints filed against the news media last year, judges and magistrates brought 25 of them, or 6 percent, according to the Media Law Resource Center. 
 Sandra Baron, executive director of the center, said it was not clear if such cases were increasing, but she said the verdict made the press more vulnerable while it is under attack ''from almost every aspect of society'' and the industry is in some economic turmoil.
 ''In the short run it looks as if the judge has vindicated his reputation,'' Ms. Baron said. ''But in the long run, society will pay for his vindication when the media is reluctant to criticize those in high office in the wake of lengthy, bitter, expensive trials.''
 It is peculiar for a judge sue a newspaper, said Cameron Stracher, a co-director of the law and journalism program at New York University Law School, because judges are supposed to protect free speech. 
 ''The courts were the last protector,'' Mr. Stracher said, ''and now even the courts are suing.''
 The Kane County Chronicle's lawyers said that when a state's highest-ranking judge brought the case, he could wield as much influence as if he were sitting on the bench. Steven P. Mandell, a defense lawyer, said that most of the witnesses were beholden to the justice and that the defense had trouble getting witnesses and experts.
 Jurors said that Justice Thomas's status made the case somewhat difficult but that they put it aside. ''He's a guy just like anyone else,'' said one juror, Kelly Groves, 26, who deals with worker compensation claims.
 Justice Thomas's lawyers said it was important for judges to be able to answer their critics. They said they understood that the suit would bring Mr. Page's columns to the attention of far more people than had seen them originally.
 Mr. Power said the accusation of a felony damaged Mr. Thomas's reputation and could impede him in trying to join a prestigious law firm or being appointed to the United States Supreme Court. He said that though few people had seen the original columns, they could be converted into attack advertisements by anyone out to get Justice Thomas.
 Jurors said they were not bothered that Mr. Page used unidentified sources, but wished there had been some confirmation of what they said. Without that, and without seeking a response from the justice before publication, the jurors said, the newspaper appeared to act recklessly.
 Rick Shaw, 50, a juror and an engineering manager, said of the charges of vote-trading, ''We were O.K. with confidential sources, but if it was so widespread, someone should have confirmed the facts.''

HEADLINE: Wartime Chinese Laborers Sue Japan for Compensation

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: FUKUOKA, Japan 

 BODY:
Graying but walking with ramrod-straight backs, Chinese men in their 70s and 80s quietly toured a coal-mining museum here recently. But in a moment of recognition reaching back to their youth, the sight of a shovel, a rake and a vise made them call out the Japanese names for the antiquated tools.
 The words were seared in the memories of the men, who otherwise spoke no Japanese, when they were forced to toil in slavelike conditions in southern Japan's mines during World War II.
Seventy-six laborers and relatives came to Japan from China in early November to pursue lawsuits against the Japanese government and companies, which refuse even to pay them their unpaid wartime wages, much less offer compensation. 
 ''The Japanese government bears responsibility for our suffering, and so do companies,'' said Tang Kunyuan, 80, who was worker ''No. 66'' at a mine here owned by Mitsubishi Mining, now known as Mitsubishi Materials, one of the world's leading makers of metal and ceramic materials for the electronics industry.
 ''First, we want an apology, then compensation,'' Mr. Tang said. ''Mitsubishi Materials has done terrible things.''
 As evidence of Japan's wartime use of forced labor has emerged in recent years, lawsuits against the government and successors to the wartime mining companies have multiplied. Fourteen suits by more than 200 Chinese forced laborers have progressed through the Japanese courts, and three have now reached the Supreme Court. 
 The results have been mixed. Of 12 rulings so far, four have favored the plaintiffs and eight the defendants. But a Supreme Court ruling against the plaintiffs may trigger suits in China, where the forced labor cases have been drawing increasing support among Chinese business leaders and where many of the Japanese companies have growing operations.
 Tokyo and the companies have argued that the plaintiffs' right to sue expired 20 years after their wartime labor, or that treaties between Japan and China invalidated all individual claims. Neither the government nor the companies involved would comment for this article.
 In rebuffing the claims, the Japanese have bucked an international trend in recent years to put aside legalisms and compensate the era's slave and forced laborers while they are still alive. 
 Since 2000, Germany and Austria have apologized for their use of slave and forced labor during World War II and have been compensating victims throughout the world. 
 The German government and companies have paid $5 billion to 1.6 million victims out of a Remembrance, Responsibility and the Future fund. The Austrian Reconciliation Fund, also financed by the government and businesses, finished paying out $350 million to 132,000 victims last year.
 ''Japan, at the state and corporate level, has taken the completely opposite approach of Germany,'' said William Underwood, an American who is finishing a dissertation on Chinese forced labor at Kyushu University here. ''Even to be charitable, it is not hard to describe the past 60 years in Japan as an unbroken history of insincerity in telling the truth and in coming to terms with the past, particularly on the issue of forced labor.''
 Indeed, as nationalist scholars and politicians in Japan, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, have led efforts to minimize Japan's militarist past in textbooks, the mood has hardened against reparations. In a suit brought three years ago by Mr. Tang and 44 other former laborers or their relatives, Mitsubishi Materials for the first time went so far as to deny that it had used forced labor.
 In a defense that echoed comments made by Mr. Abe and other nationalist politicians, Mitsubishi's lawyers questioned whether Japan had in fact invaded China and said they would leave the final judgment to posterity. 
 They described the postwar Tokyo Trials, which found Japanese leaders guilty of war crimes, as victor's justice and revenge. Ruling in favor of the Chinese, they argued, would ''impose a wrong burden of the soul on future generations of our nation, possibly for the next hundreds of years.''
 At Mitsubishi Materials' headquarters in Tokyo, two middle-ranking officials listened to the Chinese and their lawyers in front of the lobby, refusing to allow them inside or to give them their business cards. Officials of the company declined to be interviewed for this article, as did those at two other internationally known companies that have been targets of lawsuits: Mitsui Mining and the Kajima Corporation. Japan's Foreign Ministry also declined.
 As Japan suffered from severe labor shortages, it forced millions of people in Korea, Taiwan, northeast China and other regions, as well as American and other prisoners of war, to work in mines and factories across Asia and in Japan. Japan meticulously kept figures concerning the Chinese because they were foreigners, unlike colonial subjects, who were considered Japanese nationals.
 Japanese government data that began surfacing in the 1990s indicate that 38,935 Chinese men were forcibly brought to Japan, most of them after March 1944. They were made to work in 135 sites throughout Japan for 35 companies, 22 of which are still in business. 
 Of the total, 6,830 men, or nearly 18 percent, died in a little more than a year's time because of brutal working conditions. Countless others died after their capture in China or during their transit to Japan.
 Some, like Shi Huizhong, 81, were tricked into coming to Japan. In 1944 in Shanghai, Mr. Shi said, he responded to an advertisement promising high-paying work in Taiwan with a guaranteed annual trip home. Put on a ship with other men, he realized they had been duped when the ship docked here.
 Others, like Li Liangjie, 76, were simply abducted by Japanese soldiers. At the age of 14, while working in a cabbage field one day in Hebei Province, Mr. Li said, he was surrounded by Japanese soldiers and put in a truck. ''I knew they were taking away men,'' Mr. Li said. ''But because I was a child, I thought I was safe and hadn't been afraid to work out in the field.''
 After Japan's defeat, nearly all of the Chinese were sent home with no pay. Some, like Cui Shujin, 83, were handed i.o.u.'s supposedly redeemable at Japanese banks in China, but those were all shuttered by the time the men were repatriated.
 ''This is the evidence that I have kept to demand justice from Japan,'' Mr. Cui said, brandishing a copy of the document promising him his pay. 
 The unpaid wages owed the Chinese and other forced laborers -- totaling millions of dollars -- are still being kept by the Bank of Japan and other government agencies.
 Clouding the prospects of a resolution is the increasing rivalry between Japan and China over leadership in Asia. In seeking the moral high ground, China stresses Japan's perceived lack of contrition over its militarist past, noting that apologies by Japanese prime ministers have not been followed by concrete action.
 Meanwhile, Prime Minister Abe has repeatedly said he wants to build closer ties with Australia, India and other Asian democracies that respect human rights -- a not too subtle jab at China. Mr. Abe has championed the cause of a dozen or so Japanese abducted by North Korea a quarter of a century ago, emphasizing Japanese victimhood.
 The issue of forced labor remains particularly touchy for the Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed Japan nearly continuously since 1955. To cite just one example, Mr. Abe's grandfather and political model, Nobusuke Kishi, who was prime minister from 1957 to 1960, oversaw the forced labor program as minister of commerce and industry during the war. 
 In China a fund to help the plaintiffs was set up last year with the backing of the Chinese government, which has endorsed the idea of Chinese individuals suing the Japanese government. Chinese business leaders have contributed $315,000, Chinese government-controlled news organizations reported earlier this year. Lawyers said the 76 Chinese came to Japan in November thanks to that fund, whereas Japanese lawyers and other supporters had paid for the previous visits. 
 Chinese lawyers say they have begun pressing Chinese branches of the Japanese companies, many of which are dependent on China's booming economy. It is unclear whether Beijing will allow suits centering on individual claims against the state -- even if that state is Japan -- but Chinese lawyers say they are gingerly taking steps in that direction.

HEADLINE: Time Again To Choose Or Switch Drug Plans

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Starting Wednesday, Medicare beneficiaries can sign up for prescription drug coverage or switch plans, and many may want to do so because prices have changed, with some of the most popular plans charging much higher premiums for 2007. 
 In every state but Alaska and Hawaii, more than 50 drug plans are available. Beneficiaries have until Dec. 31 to sign up or change plans, but federal officials said they should act by Dec. 8 to avoid the problems that caused turmoil at pharmacies in January, when many people were unable to get their drugs.
Several recent surveys, including one by J. D. Power & Associates, the market research company, suggest that three-fourths of the people with Medicare drug coverage are satisfied. Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, said: ''The program is working. People are happy. '' 
 The Bush administration says that premiums for Medicare drug coverage will average $24 a month in 2007, about the same as in 2006. But for many beneficiaries, the reality may be substantially different.
 Melvin London, an 83-year-old retired filmmaker in New York City, said Tuesday that the new Medicare benefit had saved $245 for him and $685 for his wife. He was annoyed at the prospect of a sharp increase in premiums in 2007. For Mr. London's plan, known as Humana Enhanced, the monthly premium will be $29.60, up from $9.42.
 ''I call that bait and switch, when the company charges $9 to get you in and then goes to $29,'' Mr. London said. ''It took me three months to find a plan that was suitable. Am I now supposed to go through the same process every year to determine which plan is best for me? That's an unfair burden for beneficiaries.''
 Thomas T. Noland Jr., a senior vice president of Humana, said: ''We still offer excellent value. We will have the lowest premium in 38 states, the second-lowest in 10 states and the third-lowest in the remaining two states.''
 About 4.5 million Medicare beneficiaries receive drug coverage from Humana plans. Humana has been wooing people with free showings of the Humphrey Bogart movie ''Casablanca.'' Medicare beneficiaries eat popcorn and sip sodas while watching the film, along with a short extolling Humana's Medicare plans.
 The $24 premium emphasized by the Bush administration is for basic coverage, the minimum required by law, and many plans provide additional benefits for an extra premium. Moreover, the average includes premiums for drug coverage offered by managed care plans and by free-standing drug plans, which serve people in the traditional Medicare program.
 Both types of plans charged about $24 a month, on average, for drug coverage this year. In 2007, the average premium will increase about 10 percent for free-standing drug plans, but will decrease about 35 percent for drug coverage offered by managed care plans.
 Most drug plans have a gap in coverage. ''Beneficiaries tell us this was a helpful benefit for six or eight months, until they fell into the coverage gap,'' said Deane R. Beebe, a spokeswoman for the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer group that counsels people with Medicare.
 Some insurers provide coverage for generic drugs in the coverage gap, and a few also provide coverage for brand-name drugs in the gap. But Ms. Beebe said, ''In 11 states, we cannot find any free-standing drug plan that provides coverage for brand-name drugs in the gap.''
 The Medicare handbook, sent to all beneficiaries, says that a plan offered by Coventry Health Care will pay for generic and brand-name drugs in the coverage gap. But Francis S. Soistman Jr., executive vice president of Coventry, said Tuesday that only five brand-name drugs, out of the many available, were covered in the gap. 
 Jeff Nelligan, a Medicare spokesman, said, ''We corrected the online version of the information.''
 Sixteen Democratic senators, led by Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, said this week that some insurers were misleading consumers by marketing drug plans under names that included the word ''complete.'' 
 ''How can a plan be called 'complete' when it contains a gap in drug coverage?'' they asked in a letter to Mr. Leavitt.
 John C. Rother, policy director of AARP, the lobby for older Americans, said the new program had helped many people. His ''biggest disappointment,'' Mr. Rother said, was that several million low-income people had not applied for the extra help available to them.

HEADLINE: A New Push To Raise Cap On H-1B Visa

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
A coalition of business and education groups is making a renewed push to persuade Congress to raise the number of skilled foreign workers allowed into the United States this year. 
 The coalition, which calls itself Compete America and whose members are drawn heavily from the technology industry, sent a letter to every member of Congress on Monday calling for an increase in both the number of so-called H-1B visas, which are used by skilled immigrants and the number of employment-based green cards given to foreign workers.
''The first part is to ensure that U.S. companies have the ability to hire the best and the brightest,'' said Jack Krumholtz, managing director for federal government affairs at Microsoft. ''The second part is about making sure that we are able to retain them.'' 
 Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, is one of many technology executives who have advocated increased flexibility to hire educated foreign workers like engineers and scientists. He is expected to return to that theme at an industry conference on Wednesday at Stanford University.
 Increasing the number of H-1B visas has long been a top legislative priority of technology companies, which say they cannot find enough skilled workers in the United States. After a temporary increase to 195,000 during the years of the Internet boom, the annual number of visas issued has been capped at 65,000. An additional 20,000 visas have been granted to foreign workers who have an advanced degree from an American university.
 But in recent years, all the visas allotted for a given year were claimed on or before the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. 
 ''We can't hire people,'' said Jenifer Verdery, director of work force policy at Intel. 
 The notion of allowing more skilled foreign workers in the United States generally enjoys bipartisan support in Congress. Earlier this year, the Senate passed a bill that would increase the cap on H-1B visas to 115,000 and would automatically raise the cap by a further 20 percent if all visas for a given year were claimed. The bill also would raise the number of employment-based green cards issued to 290,000, from 140,000. 
 But the bill stalled as the House and Senate deadlocked on broader immigration reform legislation. And not everyone agrees that raising the cap on visas is a good idea. 
 ''We think that before raising the H-1B cap there should be reform of the H-1B system,'' said Ronil Hira, vice president for career activities at IEEE-USA, a professional organization representing engineers and computer programmers. 
 The organization, which includes many immigrants among its ranks, is not opposed to legal immigration. But Mr. Hira said that the H-1B visa program, which requires companies to pay foreign workers wages comparable to those they pay American workers, was riddled with loopholes that allow employers to pay subpar wages to immigrants. That, in turn, depresses the wages of American workers, Mr. Hira said.
 Lynn Shotwell, chairwoman of Compete America, said there was virtually no chance that Congress would pass the Senate bill this year. But Ms. Shotwell said the coalition, which includes universities and the Chamber of Commerce, was asking Congress to raise the cap on H-1B visas and green cards for the remainder of the fiscal year.
 Members of the coalition are hopeful that legislation modeled after the Senate bill could be enacted next year, when Democrats will control Congress. House Democrats have promoted what they are calling an innovation agenda that includes wide availability of visas for skilled immigrants.
 The National Venture Capital Association, which is among those advocating an expansion in visas and green cards for skilled workers, is backing that case with a study, to be released Wednesday, that highlights the role of immigrant entrepreneurs in the American economy. 
 The study found that one in four publicly traded American companies that were initially financed by venture capitalists in the last 15 years included at least one immigrant among their founders. During the 1980s, immigrants were involved in founding one in five such companies, and prior to 1980 only 7 percent. 
 ''The notion of being able to come here and shape your own destiny is tremendously appealing and, you have to believe, valuable for the economy, job creation and wealth creation,'' said Axel Bichara, a partner at Atlas Venture in Boston. Mr. Bichara came to the United States from Germany in 1986 to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A year later, he became co-founder of a software company.

HEADLINE: As Guard Changes in Congress, Lobbyists Scramble to Get in Step

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Republicans do not cede control of Congress for nearly two months, but money, power and influence are already beginning to change hands. The political economy, at least here in the capital, is humming for Democrats.
 Democratic lobbyists are fielding calls from pharmaceutical companies, the oil and gas industry and military companies, all of which had grown accustomed to patronizing Republicans, as the environment in Washington abruptly shifts.
Take, for example, Vic Fazio, a California Democrat who rose through the ranks of Congress and reveled in the majority for all but 4 of his 20 years in office. In his second career as a lobbyist, Mr. Fazio did not experience the pleasures of Democratic rule -- until now. Suddenly he is in demand.
 For Mr. Fazio, who is close to Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who is set to become House speaker, the power switch is, quite simply, good for business. Companies are scrambling to fortify lobbying teams with well-connected Democrats. 
 While Mr. Fazio declined to divulge his still-evolving list of prospective new clients at the law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, he said he intended to bring in Democratic reinforcements to cover the load. ''I'll just have more to do and have a little more help to do it,'' he said. 
 The Republican Party lost its grip on Congress and is now bracing to lose its hold over K Street, the bustling corridor that has become synonymous with the lobbying industry. The so-called K Street Project, an effort engineered by Republicans to dominate the trade, is unraveling, and Democrats say they intend to pass sweeping reforms rather than reverse the project for their benefit. 
 Democrats say the changing of the guard provides a raft of opportunities, second only to winning the presidency.
 Former members of Congress who left Washington have placed confidential calls to headhunters, wondering whether firms are hiring. (They are.) Former staff members have fielded inquiries from lobbying shops that have an urgent need for people with current contacts and old relationships with Democratic leaders. One prominent lobbyist said a former Senate aide was offered a starting salary of $500,000.
 Though this is the moment Democrats have been craving -- winning a majority so they can help shape politics and policy -- some senior aides are now tempted to leave Capitol Hill to become lobbyists and potentially quadruple their salaries. At the same time, some Republicans began receiving materials on unemployment benefits this week as the party sheds thousands of jobs, relinquishing staff committee assignments and leadership posts in both chambers for the first time in 12 years. 
 ''If you're a Democrat, it's a good time to be looking for work,'' said David Urban, a Republican who is the managing director of American Continental Group, a bipartisan lobbying firm. ''For Republicans, there is a little bit of panic that sets in when people realize they have to move out of their office into a cubicle.''
 At the offices of Tongour Simpson Holsclaw, a Republican firm, an unusual number of Democrats have been calling in recent days. The phones began ringing after the company's founder was quoted in Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, saying it was ''a seller's market for Democratic staffers.'' It was, said Mike Tongour, as though he had placed a giant help-wanted ad.
 ''Several Democrats said, 'I hear you are interested in expanding your firm,' '' Mr. Tongour said, recalling his post-election conversations with several senior Democratic aides. ''You got the sense that they are going to be asking for premiums.''
 Even though most firms are bipartisan, the shift in the balance of power has resulted in a shift of responsibilities between Republicans and Democrats.
 ''I've told my Democratic partners it's time for them to buy some suits,'' said Wayne Berman, a well connected Republican lobbyist. ''I went out and bought two new fishing rods and looked into yoga classes.''
 He was joking, sort of.
 Even before Election Day, the pharmaceutical industry hired Democrats to bolster its public relations efforts, hoping to ease the blow if Republicans lost their majority and Democrats followed through on pledges to let the government negotiate prescription drug prices.
 ''You literally have to create war games to plan for worst-case scenarios,'' said Ken Johnson, the vice president for government affairs at the leading trade association for drug companies. ''We've got a lot of friends on the Democratic side, but clearly we need some more.''
 Acquiring those friends, however, may not be easy. 
 Steve Elmendorf, a longtime senior adviser to former Representative Richard A. Gephardt who began working as a lobbyist at Bryan Cave Strategies in 2005, said Democrats in the House and the Senate would operate differently.
 ''The Republicans' view of lobbying is we give people money, we buy them lunch and then go up and tell them what to do,'' said Mr. Elmendorf, whose client roster included Shell Oil and Ford before the election and has grown since then. ''We go in and make public policy arguments. The business community is going to have to reorient their view.''
 As Democrats prepare for January, implications of a change in power extend across Washington.
 Lawyers say they expect their business to increase if House Democrats follow through on their pledge to investigate the Bush administration. Real estate agents paid careful attention to the election results, too, sending welcome packets to newly elected Democrats. 
 ''Because both the House and the Senate went to the Democrats, there will be a new wave and new energy,'' said Michael Rankin, managing partner of the Washington office of Sotheby's International Realty. ''A lot of people from around the country will be coming to Washington.''
 Ivan Adler, who oversees lobbyist headhunting in the Washington office of the McCormick Group, an executive search firm, said he had received calls from former members of Congress and others outside Washington ''inquiring what the job market is like in the new Democratic world.'' Mr. Adler declined to name them, citing confidentiality requirements, but he conceded that not all would make good lobbyists. 
 ''They are all popcorn in the pan -- some pop and some don't,'' Mr. Adler said. ''Hopefully you pick ones that would pop.''
 Though the supply and demand of lobbyists is shifting, well-connected Republicans have hardly been put out of work, particularly given the narrow majority in the Senate. Many lobbying firms, recoiling from a year of controversy and scandal, sell continuity as the most valued asset.
 ''As we move into a new Congress, people are wiser and they learn to distrust quick fixes,'' said Nick Allard, a Democratic lobbyist at Patton Boggs, the city's largest firm. ''That's one reason why the lobbying scandal fell apart like a political Ponzi scheme: it oversold the notion of political access.''
 Two days after the election, when it first became clear that the levers of power were shifting, a team of lobbyists at Patton Boggs prepared an analysis of what its clients could expect from a Democratic takeover. 
 To place the change of power in perspective and to lighten the mood, they opened with the timeless tale from Dr. Seuss: ''If I ran the zoo.''

HEADLINE: Get Out Now? Not So Fast, Some Experts Say

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
One of the most resonant arguments in the debate over Iraq holds that the United States can move forward by pulling its troops back, as part of a phased withdrawal. If American troops begin to leave and the remaining forces assume a more limited role, the argument holds, it will galvanize the Iraqi government to assume more responsibility for securing and rebuilding Iraq.
 This is the case now being argued by many Democrats, most notably Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the incoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who asserts that the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq should begin within four to six months.
But this argument is being challenged by a number of military officers, experts and former generals, including some who have been among the most vehement critics of the Bush administration's Iraq policies. 
 Anthony C. Zinni, the former head of the United States Central Command and one of the retired generals who called for the resignation of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, argued that any substantial reduction of American forces over the next several months would be more likely to accelerate the slide to civil war than stop it.
 ''The logic of this is you put pressure on Maliki and force him to stand up to this,'' General Zinni said in an interview, referring to Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, the Iraqi prime minister. ''Well, you can't put pressure on a wounded guy. There is a premise that the Iraqis are not doing enough now, that there is a capability that they have not employed or used. I am not so sure they are capable of stopping sectarian violence.''
 Instead of taking troops out, General Zinni said, it would make more sense to consider deploying additional American forces over the next six months to ''regain momentum'' as part of a broader effort to stabilize Iraq that would create more jobs, foster political reconciliation and develop more effective Iraqi security forces.
 The debate over American troop levels in Iraq was raging well before the establishment in March of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group led by James A. Baker III, a former secretary of state, and Lee H. Hamilton, a former congressman. Initially, it centered on Mr. Rumsfeld's stewardship at the Pentagon and whether the United States had deployed sufficient forces and taken the requisite nation-building steps to defeat, or at least contain, a virulent insurgency.
 But as the character of the Iraq conflict has changed over the past year, so has the debate. The primary worry for American commanders now is preventing the bloody cycle of drive-by shootings, kidnappings and bombings from spiraling into an all-out civil war. 
 With more American than Iraqi soldiers in Baghdad, there has been mounting frustration on the part of American officials over the failure of the Iraqi government to send sufficient reinforcements to the Iraqi capital, to establish a genuine ''unity government'' and to effectively challenge the power of the militias, some of whom have infiltrated the very Iraqi Army and police units that the American military is working with.
 In essence, the current debate turns on whether Iraqi leaders would be susceptible to the sort of blunt American pressure entailed by troop reductions. Arguing that such pressure was necessary, Senator Levin joined forces with another Democrat, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, to offer an amendment in June calling for a phased reduction of American troops, a measure he stressed has been supported by all of the potential Democratic presidential candidates. The proposal is less sweeping than most other Democratic proposals, which have called for the withdrawal of all American forces over a fixed time frame. Senator Levin's plan has assumed more political importance following the Democratic gains in the midterm elections.
 ''There is no purely military solution here,'' Mr. Levin said in an interview. ''They have got to reach a political compromise in Iraq. The leaders have got to make concessions involving power sharing and resource sharing or else this insurgency and the violence continues to spiral.''
 While Mr. Levin's plan calls for beginning troop reductions over the next six months, it does not stipulate a time-frame for completing the withdrawal, or spell out precisely how many troops should be removed in the initial phase. The plan, however, does call for shifting the American military role to more limited missions like protecting the American Embassy, training the Iraqi forces and engaging in counterterrorist operations against cells of Al Qaeda.
 ''The point of the proposal is to force the Iraqis to take hold of the situation politically,'' Mr. Levin said.
 But some current and retired military officers say the situation in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq is too precarious to start thinning out the number of American troops. In addition, they worry that some Shiite leaders would see the reduction of American troops as an opportunity to unleash their militias against the Sunnis and engage in wholesale ethnic cleansing to consolidate their control of the capital.
 John Batiste, a retired Army major general who also joined in the call for Mr. Rumsfeld's resignation, described the Congressional proposals for troop withdrawals as ''terribly naive.''
 ''There are lots of things that have to happen to set them up for success,'' General Batiste, who commanded a division in Iraq, said in an interview, describing the Iraqi government. ''Until they happen, it does not matter what we tell Maliki.''
 Before considering troop reductions, General Batiste said, the United States needs to take an array of steps, including fresh efforts to alleviate unemployment in Iraq, secure its long and porous borders, enlist more cooperation from tribal sheiks, step up the effort to train Iraq's security forces, engage Iraq's neighbors and weaken, or if necessary, crush the militias.
 Indeed, General Batiste has recently written that pending the training of an effective Iraqi force, it may be necessary to deploy tens of thousands of additional ''coalition troops.'' General Batiste said he hoped that Arab and other foreign nations could be encouraged to send troops.
 Some military experts said that while the American military is stretched thin, the number of American troops in Iraq could be increased temporarily -- by perhaps 10,000 or more, in addition to the 150,000 or so already there -- by prolonging combat tours.
 Kenneth M. Pollack, an expert at the Brookings Institution who served on the staff of the National Security Council during the Clinton administration, also argued that a push for troop reductions would backfire by contributing to the disorder in Iraq.
 ''If we start pulling out troops and the violence gets worse and the control of the militias increases and people become confirmed in their suspicion that the United States is not going to be there to prevent civil war, they are to going to start making decisions today to prepare for the eventuality of civil war tomorrow,'' he said. ''That is how civil wars start.''

HEADLINE: Will Fair Pay Have Its Day?

 BODY:
At his first post-election news conference last week, President Bush said that he believed he could find common ground with the new Congress on Democrats' longstanding drive to raise the federal minimum wage. That is welcome, but long overdue. The minimum wage has been stuck at a miserly $5.15 an hour since 1997, with Republican lawmakers blocking repeated attempts since then to raise it. Adjusted for inflation, the purchasing power of the wage has dropped to its lowest level since 1955. 
 Clearly, the bottom is falling out for the nation's estimated 5.6 million minimum-wage workers. That's bad for the economy. Even Wal-Mart, not exactly an advocate for high wages, favors raising the minimum wage to support consumer spending.
A too-low minimum wage is also bad for society. One reason for having a minimum wage is to help ensure that even the lowest-paid workers do not fall irretrievably behind everyone else. Without a higher wage, that goal is increasingly out of reach. 
 For most Americans, the economic growth of the Bush era has not translated into improved wages, greater financial security, better health care coverage or other measures of a rising standard of living. But Mr. Bush has never offered corrective policies. As for the minimum wage, he has echoed the perennial Republican warning that raising it could force businesses that can't meet the payroll to lay off workers. Persuasive and copious research on the issue disputes that assertion. 
 This summer, in perhaps the lowest blow, Republican lawmakers scuttled the most recent effort to raise the minimum wage by linking it to yet another huge estate-tax cut for America's wealthiest families, one of Mr. Bush's most cherished goals. 
 Come December, the minimum wage will have remained unchanged for the longest period since it was established in 1938. There are no valid reasons to delay an increase, and many good ones to proceed. Supporting a higher minimum wage would be a way for Mr. Bush to begin to rectify the inequality that has grown so alarmingly on his watch.

HEADLINE: Aye, Spy

BYLINE: By John Deutch. 
John Deutch, a professor of chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a director of central intelligence and a deputy secretary of defense under President Bill Clinton.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, MASS. 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH salvaged what for him was an otherwise dismal week by nominating Robert Gates to be secretary of defense. Mr. Gates is an experienced Washington hand with the right temperament to change the administration's thinking about our mission in Iraq and to make much-needed long-term changes in how we defend our nation.
 Some critics point out that Mr. Gates spent most of his career in C.I.A.'s intelligence directorate, and question whether that background is appropriate for the Pentagon job. Well, as somebody who has served at both institutions, I can't think of any better pedigree. C.I.A. intelligence analysts are dedicated to giving an objective estimate of what is really happening to policymakers who are often invested in particular outcomes. This sort of neutral mind-set is just what President Bush needs and the country expects. 
The big question he must answer on Iraq is this: Are we making progress toward meeting our minimum objectives -- helping the Iraqis maintain security, establishing a working government and restoring basic services? If the answer is no, as I suspect, then Mr. Gates should tell the president that it is time to withdraw. Better sooner than later to avoid more lives lost and more treasure spent.
 Contrary to conventional wisdom on both sides of the aisle, the consequences of withdrawal need not be catastrophic to American interests in the region. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice; the national security adviser, Steve Hadley; and Mr. Gates need to develop a secondary track, simultaneous with a military withdrawal, centered on new economic and diplomatic initiatives in the Middle East to re-establish America's credibility and purpose. 
 In particular, we must take a new approach to Iran: its actions can encourage or dampen civil violence in Iraq, its oil exports are important to world supply and its uranium enrichment program puts it on a path to a nuclear bomb. Two years ago, Mr. Gates and the national security adviser in the Carter administration, Zbigniew Brzezinski, led a Council on Foreign Relations committee that recommended a more active approach to Iran centered on a ''compartmentalized process of dialogue, confidence building and incremental engagement.'' Mr. Gates's work on the committee demonstrated his pragmatic approach to foreign policy and his ability to work effectively with those of differing ideologies. 
 Yes, there is an aspect of irony in having a former intelligence director become secretary of defense after the Iraqi weapons-of-mass-destruction intelligence failure was used to justify our 2003 invasion. And it is also true that the cultures of the C.I.A. and the Pentagon are very different. But Mr. Gates would not be the first top director of central intelligence to become secretary of defense. James Schlesinger moved from the intelligence directorship to the Pentagon in the 1970s, and he is remembered for his fierce independence from the White House. 
 Of course, there will be much more on the new secretary's plate than just Iraq. First, I hope that Mr. Gates will quickly re-establish the trusting relationship with senior military leaders -- the chairman the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the heads of the combat and supporting joint commands -- that was the hallmark of Secretary of Defense William Perry's successful tenure in the 1990s. 
 Next year's Pentagon budget, at greater than $530 billion, is giving Congress sticker shock. Down the road, modernization costs will only increase and there will be a large bill to pay to ''reset'' the Army and Marine Corps readiness and equipment to acceptable levels after we leave Iraq. 
 Mr. Gates is well suited for making his case to Congress. He is not, however, a technology or acquisitions expert, and he will need to listen to others in establishing a sound and affordable multiyear program to reshape the military to meet today's threats.
 Perhaps nobody is better suited than Mr. Gates for reforming the military's intelligence operations. The revamping of the government's intelligence community in 2004 has been a mixed success. One important shortcoming is the Defense Department's continued use of its considerable intelligence budget to run its programs in isolation from the other intelligence agencies. 
 Mr. Gates surely understands the need to integrate the military's intelligence operations with those of other agencies. The Pentagon should stop competing with other agencies over collection and dissemination of information, and become more of an informed user of intelligence gathered by the multiagency intelligence community. 
 Last, a few will raise questions, based on Mr. Gates's involvement in the Iran-contra affair, about his ability to control covert operations. In this, I have full confidence in Mr. Gates's judgment. When I was the C.I.A. chief, my job was made easier by the way Mr. Gates had structured the partnership between the directorate of operations and the directorate of intelligence during his tenure in order to ensure that operations were launched only after disciplined analytic thinking of consequences. 
 To President Bush, for his choice of Robert Gates, I say ''bravo,'' a word I'll bet he has not heard a lot recently. Congress should confirm the nominee promptly, thank him for his willingness to serve, and tell him we expect great results.

HEADLINE: Spitzer, on Upstate Tour, Speaks of Reviving Region

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer began a two-day, three-city ''economic revitalization tour'' through upstate New York on Tuesday, highlighting potential development projects that he asserted could reverse the loss of people and jobs in an area he once compared to Appalachia.
 ''The governor in Albany controls a budget of $114, $115 billion,'' Mr. Spitzer said following a presentation by officials of the Peace Bridge in Buffalo, one of the busiest crossings on the United States-Canada border. ''Reining it in is important, but spending it wisely is also important.'' 
A proposal to build a second bridge, which local officials say is crucial to future growth in the area, has been delayed for years because of bureaucratic squabbles and a lack of money. Mr. Spitzer suggested that he was prepared to find more aid to build the bridge, calling it ''an investment worth making.'' 
 ''The projects that we're talking about here require capital,'' he said. ''The state should not be parsimonious in rebuilding what has been one of the greatest cities in our nation.''
 Mr. Spitzer is the latest New York politician who will enter office promising to bring prosperity back to the upstate region, which over decades has been buffeted by base closings, the loss of manufacturing jobs to free trade and population decline.
 During his campaign, Mr. Spitzer promised to harmonize the state's balkanized business development efforts, attract new information-age industries upstate, and allocate state grants to propel conversion of commercial-oriented downtowns in Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse to apartments, restaurants and stores.
 Mr. Spitzer also criticized the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's primary economic development agency. He said that under the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki, it had been too focused on projects in New York City, a complaint that upstate Republican lawmakers have leveled at Democrats in the past. Mr. Spitzer said that he would consider appointing a co-chairman of the agency to focus strictly on upstate development. 
 Mr. Spitzer made the Appalachia comparison at a campaign stop in March, earning rebukes from some -- especially Republicans who complained that he was insulting upstate residents -- but plaudits from many business executives, who said Mr. Spitzer's characteristically blunt assessment was appropriately dire. 
 Asked how he would succeed where others have failed, Mr. Spitzer emphasized the ''different levers'' that he would have as governor to focus capital spending where it was needed, among other efforts.
 He also said that Democratic lawmakers like Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E. Schumer, and Representative Brian Higgins from the Buffalo area, would gain power with Democratic majorities controlling the House and Senate, allowing them to bring more money back to the state for development. ''Washington matters a great deal,'' Mr. Spitzer said.
 Mr. Spitzer began his tour in Buffalo, which has lost a tenth of its population in the last decade and has the shuttered storefronts and abandoned factories to prove it. Mr. Spitzer and State Senator David A. Paterson, the lieutenant governor-elect, toured a proposed development site on Buffalo's lakefront with Byron W. Brown, the city's mayor, as well as local politicians and business leaders. 
 ''He focused on economic development, on our upcoming agenda, and the overall needs of Buffalo and upstate New York,'' Mr. Brown said, after a private meeting with Mr. Spitzer on Tuesday morning. ''The priority of this administration clearly shows, and he reaffirmed his strong commitment to that.''
 Mr. Spitzer is to resume the tour on Wednesday in Rochester, where he is scheduled to meet with Mayor Robert Duffy and business leaders. He will end the tour in Syracuse, where he plans to meet with Mayor Matthew J. Driscoll and Nancy Cantor, the chancellor of Syracuse University. He will tour development sites in both cities.

HEADLINE: Rare Look At China's Burdened Banks

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Two years ago, one of China's largest state-owned banks hired a senior risk adviser who had previously worked for major banks in the United States. His mission was to advise the Chinese bank on how to clean up its books, by helping assess loans that were going bad. 
 The banker's career at the China Construction Bank, however, would prove to be contentious and short. It ended with his firing in July, after he repeatedly told top executives that up to $3 billion in bad loans might have been intentionally hidden from outside auditors, just months before the bank's first sale of stock to public investors.
Officials at the bank strongly dispute the assertions, saying they investigated and dismissed them. The bank called the risk adviser a disgruntled employee. 
 But the dispute between China Construction and the banker -- who spoke on condition that he not be identified because of fear of reprisals in China -- provides a rare glimpse inside a banking system that analysts say continues to have widespread problems that could ultimately threaten the country's breakneck economic growth.
 The analysts say that China's big banks have made too many loans for political or social reasons, rather than commercially sound ones, that may never be repaid. While the government has sought to ease the problem by spending $400 billion since 1998 to cover bad loans for real estate projects or to state-owned enterprises, fears remain that banks are still burdened with many more troubled loans than they acknowledge.
 Even a top official of the central bank recently acknowledged that bad loans remained an issue. ''The task of avoiding a rebound in nonperforming loans is still huge and difficult,'' Wu Xiaoling, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, told a financial conference recently, according to a Chinese Web site, sina.com.
 Today, countless new buildings, and cranes constructing still more of them, fill the skylines of cities across China, financed by loans from the banks. But half-completed buildings and warehouses, where construction has stopped, also dot cityscapes. 
 If loans to many of these borrowers are not repayable, as analysts suspect, the losses at some point could weigh down the country's financial system, potentially constraining the banks' ability to lend to new projects or companies. 
 Yet the amount of bad loans that Chinese banks officially report on their books is well within a range that would be acceptable for Western banks. 
 At China Construction Bank, officials noted that outside auditors had signed off on the books. And at the end of 2004, the bank said it had some $10.31 billion in bad loans on its books, or just 3.92 percent of its $263 billion in total loans, according to the bank's filing. An additional $3 billion in bad loans, the amount supposedly hidden, would be sizable but not enough to threaten the bank's stability and thus not a cause for major concern, the banking analysts say.
 Similarly, China's commercial banks officially have an estimated $163 billion in nonperforming loans, a manageable 7.5 percent of their total in June 2006, according to the China Banking Regulatory Commission. 
 But analysts say the bad-loan figure could be more than double the official reports. Fitch Ratings said its own estimate of problem loans is closer to $480 billion. The agency, along with other analysts, suspects that most of those loans are on bank books in the ''special mention loan'' category, the second and lowest level of performing loans, though still deemed good.
 ''A lot of analysts have been skeptical'' of the bad loan figures, said Charlene Chu, a Fitch analyst. ''The improvement in the nonperforming loan ratios have been so dramatic that some analysts question whether they can improve that fast.''
 Despite these concerns, some of the world's largest financial institutions are buying stakes in Chinese banks. In the last year, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, the Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, Merrill Lynch, HSBC and American Express have all bought minority stakes in Chinese banks ahead of planned initial stock offerings. 
 For now, many of those investments look like winners. China Construction's public offering in Hong Kong in the fall of 2005 raised $9.2 billion and at the time was the biggest stock offering worldwide in four years. The Bank of China topped that, raising $11.2 billion in an initial public stock offering in mid-2006. And late in October, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country's largest bank with more than $800 billion in assets, sold a 16 percent stake, raising about $22 billion.
 ''The China theme is hot, and everyone wants some exposure,'' said Jonathan Anderson, the chief Asia economist at UBS. 
 The dispute between China Construction and its senior risk adviser began toward the end of 2004. He had joined the bank earlier that year to help China Construction as it was preparing for its initial public stock offering in October 2005. 
 The adviser, who studied at Beijing University and later earned a Ph.D. in applied mathematics at an American university, had previously worked for two leading multinational banks in the United States. 
 Asked about his time at China Construction, the risk officer confirmed that he had differences with top executives, but said he wanted to avoid a public dispute. Officials at the bank, responding to inquiries, confirmed that it had a disagreement with the former employee and discussed details about the differences. 
 As a senior adviser, he was allowed to travel through the country, going from branch to branch to assess the bank's nonperforming loan ratio -- which was among the bank's most sensitive data. At one point, he reported directly to the chairman. 
 The government had been pressing the big four state banks to sharply improve their nonperforming loan ratios, and China Construction had turned in the best numbers at that point, reducing its share to 3.92 percent of loan assets late in 2004, down from 17 percent in 2002.
 But the risk adviser began cautioning that bad loans were being hidden at the bank's branches, erroneously labeled as good loans, even though company records showed that they were impaired. He told bank officials that in Beijing and Tianjin alone, he had uncovered $750 million in bad loans that had been deemed good. Though large northern cities, the two account for just a small fraction of nationwide loans. 
 The risk adviser wrote to his superiors, including the chairman at the time, Zhang Enzhao, that many nonperforming loans were being hidden in the ''special mention loan'' category. According to Fitch Ratings, at the end of 2005, nearly 12 percent of the bank's loans were in that category.
 Mr. Zhang, though, resigned in March 2005, after a lawsuit filed in the United States accused him of accepting a $1 million bribe from an American company doing business in China. He was in time replaced by Guo Shuqing, a well-regarded former official of the central bank, who pushed China Construction to go forward with a public listing. (Mr. Zhang recently was sentenced to 15 years in prison for accepting bribes.)
 The risk adviser persisted. China Construction officials recently acknowledged that months before the bank's public offering, he sent letters or e-mail messages to the new chairman, Mr. Guo, as well as the bank's president and other executives. In that correspondence, he told them that the bank was hiding some of its bad assets. 
 The red flags were raised at a critical time, because unanticipated bad news could have resulted in a delay in the offering. The bank went ahead, maintaining that after an audit by KPMG there were no undisclosedproblems in its loan books. After the stock offering, the bank says the risk adviser continued to press for the problems to be fixed. 
 Another senior official at the China Construction Bank, who spoke on the condition that he not be named for fear of reprisals, said that internal risk controls were inadequate and that the outside auditors from KPMG often battled with bank officials over bad-loan assessments.
 China Construction Bank officials say that even the suggestion there were hidden loans is preposterous.
 ''Hidden bad loan information does not exist at C.C.B.,'' a spokesman said. The bank added that in August 2004, a team of internal investigators looked into some of the risk adviser's assertions and found no evidence there were ''mischaracterized loans'' on the books. 
 In a statement issued in response to questions, China Construction said, ''Our bank's management and responsible persons in our risk management department conducted a diligent discussion and evaluation of the issues he raised, concluding that he had not provided any valuable evidence and that his reasoning was simplistic and arbitrary, with some things clearly contrary to common sense, and therefore it did not have a minimal level of persuasiveness.''
 The bank cited several letters from the risk adviser, reading them aloud or making reference to them in an interview at its Beijing headquarters several weeks ago. Bank officials said that even though the risk adviser was one of the institution's top-ranking risk officials, he was unqualified to assess its loan portfolio.
 Moreover, it questioned his motives. In one letter the bank released in part, the adviser told the bank in August 2005 that it had three choices: to give him a new assignment, fire him with a severance package or, if it refused either of those two, he would ask his New York lawyer, among other things, to reveal information about the bank -- ''especially about several key risk management department executives,'' who, he said, ''manipulated C.C.B.'s bad loan ratio.''
 In July, the risk adviser was fired, the bank said, for forging his sick-leave papers.
 No one outside the China Construction Bank was told about the accusations until July, when officials at Bank of America -- which paid $3 billion in 2005 to acquire a 9 percent stake that is now worth more than $9 billion -- say they received a letter from the former adviser detailing some of his findings and arguments that the bank was manipulating its figures. 
 They rejected the accusations as ''unlikely'' after interviewing the adviser by telephone and then holding discussions with China Construction officials.
 Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., said in a statement: ''KPMG, the bank's outside auditor, and the global underwriters of C.C.B.'s initial public offering conducted extensive reviews of C.C.B.'s loan portfolio prior to the I.P.O. last October. Based on our knowledge of those exhaustive efforts, and our own due diligence prior to our initial investment, we thought it unlikely these allegations were true.'' 
 Still, Bank of America officials say they passed on the letter containing the accusations to board members of China Construction Bank. A KPMG official in Beijing declined comment.
 China Construction Bank officials say the company's loan portfolio is in good shape, that top auditors now regularly peruse the loan books and new risk-management procedures have been put in place.
 All these help explain, they say, why the company's shares have risen sharply since it went public.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. House Leaders Withdraw Vietnam Trade Bill

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 

 BODY:
Prospects for Congressional approval of several free trade bills backed by the administration were thrown into doubt Tuesday when House Republican leaders abruptly withdrew the one aimed at Vietnam on the eve of President Bush's trip there this week.
 The failure of the Vietnam bill was a deep disappointment and embarrassment for the White House, which had hoped that the president would hail its passage as a milestone in improvement in relations with a country where tens of thousands of Americans died more than 30 years ago. 
The bill's failure touched off a fusillade of partisan recriminations, with Republicans blaming Democrats for trying to sabotage the bill and Democrats saying that some Republicans, bitter after losing the election last week, were trying to embarrass Mr. Bush.
 Though the bill could come back to the House before the end of the year, some legislative aides said that its future was in doubt, along with that of several other bills lowering trade barriers with poor countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The administration remained hopeful, at least on the surface.
 ''As we've said all along, we will work with the Congressional leadership on the Vietnam bill and the other bills,'' Stephen Norton, a spokesman for Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, said. ''This is important legislation and we remain hopeful that Congress will approve it as soon as possible.''
 The unsettled atmosphere was another sign of the fraying of the pledges of bipartisan cooperation after last week's midterm elections, as well as a reflection of lingering sensitivities over Vietnam. Most of all, it seemed to be a sign that whatever consensus had existed for free trade bills was also starting to crumble.
 A spokesman for Representative John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who is House majority leader in the waning weeks of this Congress, said there was a ''possibility'' that the bill could come back later in the lame-duck session. He said the bill was withdrawn because Democrats were turning against it.
 The bill came before the House on Monday night and won a majority of votes, with 228 lawmakers voting in favor and 161 against. More than 40 lawmakers of both parties had not yet returned to Washington, however, and it fell short of the two-thirds needed to pass according to the special rules under which the bill was introduced.
 House leaders immediately expressed confidence that it would pass as early as Tuesday under regular rules enabling it to be approved by a simple majority. But the ''yes'' votes appeared to be melting away under a sustained campaign by organized labor and other opponents who argue that the bills cost American jobs.
 Kevin Madden, the spokesman for Mr. Boehner, said that the majority leader learned that an effort would be made by House Democrats to send the Vietnam measure back to the committee level, and that the maneuver might succeed. He said Democrats were being pressed by labor groups and anti-trade groups that backed them in the election.
 But Democrats said the bill seemed to be a victim of disarray in Republican ranks, and antipathy toward the departing chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Representative Bill Thomas of California, an ardent advocate of free trade.
 An administration official, asking not to be identified, said there appeared to be elements of bad faith and bad feelings on all sides.
 Democrats said they had asked the Republican leadership to delay the vote Monday night until Tuesday to allow dozens of lawmakers to return. But they said they were rebuffed by Mr. Boehner's and Mr. Thomas's offices, which expressed confidence that the necessary two-thirds votes were available.
 The troubles of the Vietnam bill occur as lawmakers are beginning to discern where the new center of gravity is on the many issues debated in the campaign this year.
 In the last few years, a large majority of Democrats have voted against trade bills, like one in 2005 lowering barriers with Central American countries, fearing that imports of textiles and other commodities produced there could throw Americans out of their jobs. 
 Several Democrats who won in the election this month, notably Senator-elect Sherrod Brown of Ohio, had run promising to block or slow future trade bills in Congress.
 The Vietnam bill, however, had the support of crucial Democrats, including the future House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, and Representative Charles B. Rangel, the expected next chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, as well as the Republican leadership. 
 The Vietnam bill was aimed at establishing ''permanent normal trade relations'' with Vietnam, which is joining the World Trade Organization and, as a result, is obliged to lower trade barriers and subsidies on its products. 
 Failure of the measure does not bar Vietnam from joining the World Trade Organization. Rather, it would place the United States out of compliance with the organization, because the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, passed in 1975, requires an annual review of Vietnam's political and economic practices, which is not allowed under the W.T.O.'s rules. 
 The administration argued that granting Vietnam ''normal'' trade status is the best way of getting it to abide by international trade rules, including bans on copyright piracy and restrictions on foreign investments and imports.

HEADLINE: Couldn't Make It to Paris? The Catwalk Comes to Boston

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
AT the entrance to ''Fashion Show: Paris Collections 2006,'' the first costume exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in more than a decade, visitors face a video projection of life-size models catwalking toward a recessed door so narrow and shadowed that the crowd assembled there recalls the stylish scrum that forms in Paris, outside the tents of the Tuileries Gardens, whenever a big designer shows.
 ''Fashion Show'' is made up of pieces from 10 recent Paris collections, shown on mannequins mounted to re-creations of the runways on which Yohji Yamamoto, Viktor & Rolf, Chanel, Dior and others originally presented their collections. But any resemblance to the experience of going to those shows begins and ends right at the door. 
A museum show about fashion shows provides new fodder for debate among art critics and curatorial purists over the increasingly commercial direction of many museums. Nevertheless, Malcolm Rogers, director of the Museum of Fine Arts, unflinchingly described his strategy in W magazine this month: ''I want to make the MFA the style capital of the museum world.'' But for those who are tabulating the cultural value of elevating the fashion industry's most effective marketing tool -- the runway -- into a subject for serious discourse in an institution of fine arts, ''Fashion Show'' provides as much unexpected substance as it does eye candy.
 As Pamela Parmal, curator of the museum's department of fashion and textiles, explained, the evolution of runway shows into theatrical events detached from the reality of what people wear justified an examination of what was happening in Paris, where the most creative designers work today.
 ''I want people to ask questions while they are walking through the gallery,'' Ms. Parmal said. ''Is this reflective of the time? Is this art? Is this marketing? Are these people crazy?'' 
 She was referring to the designers.
 At first glance, it would seem that studying the window displays along Madison Avenue or watching Fashion Television for 15 minutes would yield a visual experience nearly identical to a walk through ''Fashion Show.'' Indeed, a review in The Boston Herald last week advised readers to see the exhibition ''just to remind yourself what museums want to become: Everyman's place for culture, pop and otherwise.'' 
 The complaints are part of an old argument. Fashion's place in museums has been established, and controversial exhibitions have been as at home at the Guggenheim (motorcycles and Armani) as in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (see last year's Chanel-sponsored show on Chanel). The Museum of Fine Arts weathered stiffer criticism last year for popular shows on Ralph Lauren's automobile collection and the America's Cup yachts owned by William Koch. At worst, ''Fashion Show'' could be an omen of museum subjects to come -- perhaps a retrospective, sponsored by Macy's, of designs made for ''Project Runway.''
 Certainly by inviting the designers (or more precisely, their publicists) to participate in the installation of their work, the museum flouts any conventional curatorial approach. Moreover, the fashion is so contemporary -- from the spring couture shown in January and the fall ready-to-wear collections shown in February and March -- that some designs are the same as those whose work is now hanging in stores. 
 But for all its appearance of shilling for designers, the exhibition has been a hit since it opened on Nov. 8, its beauty deceptively guised in its simplicity. To join the hundreds of museum-goers as they pace through the galleries, many boldly assessing the work, is to grasp the appeal of fashion today in popular culture. Collections can now be scrutinized on Style.com, and television shows like ''Project Runway'' and ''Ugly Betty'' have pulled back the curtains of the industry, making astute critics of the museum-going public.
 ''Valentino's my man,'' said Nancy Pantano, a retired jeweler from Beverly Cove, Mass., as she studied the designer's couture gowns displayed against a wall painted yellow to look like the sunset backdrop of the Paris show. ''He likes women. He'll do a little something for women with curves. Chanel is beautiful, too.''
 As Ms. Pantano and other patrons talked about the show, they sometimes revealed personal issues with the intimidating world of fashion, where clothes are too young, too skinny, too expensive, but they could relate to the designs better when they saw them in person. Only a few hundred people have access to such collections on the runways, and museum retrospectives generally show only vintage pieces. Here, anyone can see contemporary couture by Christian Lacroix, Valentino, John Galliano of Christian Dior and Karl Lagerfeld of Chanel without their noses pressed to glass cases or computer screens. Many patrons actually tried to touch the clothes, now dangling inches in front of them.
 ''Gor-geous,'' said Karen Fido of Falmouth, Mass., on her way through the gallery. 
 ''I see a lot of Jackie Kennedy '60s in those boxy skirts,'' Ms. Fido said, pointing to the Chanel garments, which were installed on a curved runway, a sliver of the ivory tower Mr. Lagerfeld had built for his couture collection. Ms. Fido said she was stunned by a notation that each dress required 450 to 900 hours of sequin sewing. ''I hadn't given a huge amount of thought to fashion,'' she said. ''I hadn't considered how much art is actually involved.'' 
 AT the show you also hear insightful observations about the Viktor & Rolf collection, in which classic trench coats and knife-pleated wedding gowns were dipped in silver, or about Mr. Yamamoto's oversize misfit suits. 
 ''You see what was going on in Belgium, France and Italy this year, and you see that in an immediate way,'' said Kate deBethune, who was visiting the show with Angela Nichols, a co-worker at an online resource site for physicians. 
 Like many other visitors, they reacted most strongly to the Christian Dior couture collection, in which the organza gowns were splattered with what looked like red blood to evoke both the French Revolution and the riots that took place in France in 2005. Ms. Nichols, a fan of French history even before the latest film version of ''Marie Antoinette'' was released, said that the shapes of the dresses added another layer to the collection, and that ''some of them look like monks and nuns.'' She added, ''The black cloak dress looks like the Grim Reaper meets a priest.''
 Ms. deBethune chimed in: ''This other one is a nun's habit,'' except that it is cut off so the nun is naked from the waist down. ''It really does make an impression.''
 The next day, Rosalinda Jacobson, a retired teacher of family and consumer sciences (formerly known as home economics) from Peabody, Mass., had a different reaction.
 ''This Dior was horrific,'' she said. ''Some of these collections are political messages. But there doesn't seem to be a lot out there for very large women. That sends a bad message.''
 Moments later, Janet Tiampo of Lexington, Mass., was watching the video footage of the Dior show and announced that she was pleased to see large posteriors returning to vogue, though not in those exact words. ''It's like that scene in 'The Devil Wears Prada' where they talk about how a blue sweater was influenced by the runways,'' she said. ''So O.K., when are we going to see these elements at T. J. Maxx?'' 
 Around the corner, Jacque Smith, a retired engineer from Concord, Mass., was reading aloud from the wall text behind Mr. Lacroix's collection: ''A festival in Arles with a Goya-style paseo of toreras, Picassian soft sevillanas and a procession of virginal debutantes.''
 The intellectually curious cannot pass up anything, Mr. Smith said, not even a show about fashion shows of dubious inspiration.
 ''It's fun and a little bizarre at the same time,'' he said. ''Some parts of the world go crazy and follow this in every detail. But I think fashion comes down to what we know in everyday life.''
 That is something you might have missed on Style.com.

HEADLINE: And Now A Baby, Too!

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CANNELL

 BODY:
WHEN Sara Kate Gillingham-Ryan told friends late last winter that she was pregnant, they offered the obligatory congratulations. Then they asked when she was moving. 
 It was assumed that she and her husband, Maxwell, would have to go somewhere else. For four years the couple shared a 265-square-foot, one-bedroom rental on Bedford Street in the West Village, an apartment so preposterously miniature it could fit neatly inside the foyer of many apartments uptown. They made it work for the two of them in part by jettisoning clothes, a television and a home office. ''It never felt too small,'' said Ms. Gillingham-Ryan, 31, a food writer. ''It helps to keep your life well edited.''
No amount of editing, it seemed, would create enough room for a baby. But after looking at more than a dozen apartments, and weighing the benefits of more square footage against the burden of debt, they decided to stay on Bedford Street, where they pay $780 a month for rent. And they would renovate to accomplish the seemingly impossible: accommodate a baby. 
 Their decision was influenced by Mr. Gillingham-Ryan's role as founder and guiding spirit of apartmenttherapy.com, a home design blog that favors modernist rooms with an inviting but decidedly simple look. They are efficient rooms in which acquisition is carefully considered, and splurges are held in abeyance. Mr. Gillingham-Ryan also has an interior design practice that, like the blog, is a mixture of therapy and design.
 ''For the Web site it was an exercise in proving yet again that when you're frustrated with your apartment and feel like moving, there are other solutions,'' said Mr. Gillingham-Ryan, whose book, ''Apartment Therapy: The Eight-Step Home Cure,'' was published in March by Bantam. ''New York is a tough place, and it throws a lot of challenges at you. This is about proving that you can overcome obstacles like square footage and rent.'' 
 So the Gillingham-Ryans set out to remake their undersize home for family life, soliciting reader opinions along the way. In Internet parlance, they would blog their renovation. ''We're not afraid,'' Mr. Gillingham-Ryan, 40, wrote on the site. ''We're inspired.'' Their total cost would have been $30,000, but they saved $10,000 by buying to-the-trade items and swapping advertising on the Web site for some goods.
 He posted their plans and progress in 26 installments, the last of which appeared on Tuesday (a slide show of the complete apartment will be posted next month). From the beginning, readers engaged in choruses of chattering debate over the relative merits of the conspicuously assertive yellow paint chosen for the kitchen wall (Nacho Cheese is the designation on Benjamin Moore's color palette) and the sculptural Dornbracht Meta bathroom faucet, a trophy fixture with a commensurate price tag, among other things. 
 The harshest comments on the blog were reserved for Mr. Gillingham-Ryan for subjecting his pregnant wife to the discomforts of renovation and for forcing her and the baby to live in an inadequate space. For her part, Ms. Gillingham-Ryan said she undertook the renovation as readily as her husband did. ''I get a lot of, 'You must be a saint,' '' she said. 
 She might have been a willing partner in the experiment, but it could not have helped matters that workers were still hanging the kitchen cabinets when she went into labor three weeks ago. ''I was very lucky the baby came 10 days late,'' Mr. Gillingham-Ryan said. ''Very lucky.'' 
 By the time Ursula Bayes Gillingham-Ryan came home, the contractors had decamped for good and the apartment was a serene, comfortable place with subdued colors and a pleasing fluctuation of smooth and rough surfaces -- economical, to be sure, but not uncomfortably so.
 ''The only problem with all this is kids,'' Mr. Gillingham-Ryan said one day last month while Ursula napped in the bedroom. ''She's a ticking time bomb. She's going to need room. We know we can't stay here for long.''

Kitchen
 The kitchen is a compact affair arranged along one wall of the entryway. ''Many of the best restaurants in New York have tiny kitchens,'' Mr. Gillingham-Ryan said. ''Size doesn't mean it's better.'' 
 The continuous 16-foot stretch of countertop, made of Durat, a material fabricated from recycled plastic, creates a clean, unbroken line. The countertop was designed to accommodate the open front door; it widens once for the cooking area, and again for a modest station used to prepare food and drinks. 
 The new kitchen has roughly 40 percent more storage than before, with cabinets of solid bamboo from Henrybuilt, a company based in Seattle that recently opened a store at 79 Grand Street (212-966-5797 or henrybuilt.com). 
 The Gillingham-Ryans saved space by replacing their full-size refrigerator with a 24-inch under-the-counter model from Summit ($639 from Compact Appliance; 800-297-6076 or compactappliance.com). The cooktop and wall oven are from DeLonghi ($1,329 together, from Levi Capland; 718-725-7285). 

Living Room
 The living room walls were skim-coated with plaster, and painted in two tones: below table height (30 inches) they are Bone White; above that line they are China White. ''It brings the center of gravity down closer to the floor,'' Mr. Gillingham-Ryan said, ''and the subtle shift of color adds richness to the room.''
 The couple share a single closet bisected into his and hers by Astech Closet Systems (212-244-6970 or astechclosets.com). The closet door was replaced with a linen panel; lighted from within, the closet impersonates a window, with a glowing illusion of depth and space. 
 The couple replaced the apartment's conventional two-inch-wide floor planks with five-and-a-half-inch-wide oak planks. ''It's casual and less busy,'' Mr. Gillingham-Ryan said. They stained the floor a deep coffee-bean brown. ''Like the earth, the floor is dark,'' he said. ''It has a sense of groundedness when it has a dark quality to it.'' 
 The single piece of upholstered furniture is the Nurseryworks Sleepytime Rocker in off-white Ultrasuede ($930 from Design Public; www.designpublic.com). 

Bedroom
 Seven years ago, before Ms. Gillingham-Ryan moved in, Mr. Gillingham-Ryan raised the bedroom floor and surrounded the mattress with six storage compartments sunk into the floor, like subterranean closets, with sliding doors of opaque plexiglass. In the recent renovation they sliced away the raised floor at the end of the bed to allow easy passage to and from a baby changing station, where the desk used to be. A bassinet is kept at the head of the bed. Three of the six storage cabinets were sacrificed.
 The bedroom and the bathroom are insulated against noise with sliding doors of half-inch-thick industrial wool felt ($150 a door, from Sutherland Felt; 248-280-0450).

HEADLINE: Toyota Gambles, Deep in the Heart of Texas

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Toyota's approach to the pickup truck market has always been cautious, dipping a toe in the market with small trucks, then bringing out slightly bigger models that its own executives acknowledged were meek.
 Even when it built its first American truck plant last decade in Indiana, Toyota did not make a complete commitment, dividing the assembly line between pickups, minivans and sport utility vehicles.
Now that caution is coming to an end. 
 Toyota is placing a big bet on a big truck, built at a big plant in a big state that takes its pickups seriously -- and where the rivalry for buyers has always been among the three big Detroit companies.
 The risks go beyond the size of the investment. Toyota has built a reputation among consumers for selling fuel-efficient vehicles. But with big V-8 engines powering the new Tundra, that reputation could falter somewhat as it joins the horsepower-and-torque marketing battle with Detroit automakers. 
 On Friday, Toyota will officially open its new $1.2 billion assembly plant here, although it has already begun building the biggest version yet of its Tundra pickup, which goes on sale Feb. 12. In a sign of its importance to the automaker, Katsuaki Watanabe, Toyota's president, will make a rare American appearance to dedicate the factory.
 Given the company's reputation for innovations in manufacturing, many in the industry are eager to see what is new at the plant. But Toyota, showing signs of its past caution, is not ready to give away secrets.
 Its first-ever tour of the plant on Wednesday was limited to a few spots along the assembly line. Toyota officials declined to discuss the technology beyond what they showed. And they quickly corrected a plant manager who said the trucks built here would have more than 90 percent North American parts, or about 10 percent higher than what Toyota has previous disclosed.
 The new Tundra, bigger and more powerful than the current model, is being watched carefully for its impact on the final market that Detroit can truly call its own.
 ''Toyota's San Antonio strategy has two profound implications,'' said John A. Casesa, a veteran auto analyst with the Casesa Shapiro Group. ''First, it can do serious, even potentially fatal damage to Detroit's financial health by attacking the domestic industry's last sizable source of extraordinary profits. Second, it will, once and for all, cause many consumers to think of Toyota not as a Japanese company, but as a global company, or even an American company.''
 James P. Womack, co-author of ''The Machine That Changed the World,'' which studied Japanese companies' American operations, agreed that the Texas plant was fraught with symbolism.
 ''Tundra in Texas marks the complete Americanization of Toyota,'' he said. ''There are no segments left to conquer and no part of the country overlooked.''
 But the Tundra will face new competition from Detroit, too. Before it goes on sale, General Motors should be rolling out new versions of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, and Ford Motor should have a new Super Duty version of its F-series truck.
 Ron Pinelli, an analyst with Autodata, an industry statistics firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., said Detroit would retain its leadership in full-size pickups. By itself, ''the Tundra does not spell doom,'' he said, but it would squeeze Detroit's profits at a time when Ford and Chrysler have suffered big losses and G.M. is crawling back to profitability after some of its worst losses in its history.
 And any kind of improvement in truck sales would spell success for Toyota, which, despite pushing past DaimlerChrysler this year to capture third place in the overall American market, sells just 5 percent of the country's full-size pickups. 
 ''The new truck can only do better,'' Mr. Pinelli said.
 Toyota is waiting to start shipping its trucks until it can deliver at least four to each of its 1,200 dealers, including at least one Tundra equipped with a new 5.7-liter V-8 engine that it plans to begin building at its Huntsville, Ala., plant in January.
 To tout the Tundra's arrival, Toyota has erected billboards throughout this city. One sits just blocks from the Alamo, declaring the pickup to be one more reason ''not to mess with Texas.'' Indeed, a blue lone star sits above the entrance to the Toyota plant, while the Texas flag flies out front next to the stars and stripes.
 The Texas location was an important part of Toyota's strategy to appeal to buyers in the nation's biggest truck market. It also played into the company's goal of diversifying both its work force and management. About 55 percent of the nearly 2,000 workers hired here are of Hispanic origin, plant officials said Wednesday, reflecting the population of San Antonio.
 In addition, Toyota chose a group of minority-owned companies from around San Antonio to partner with its parts suppliers and build small factories that surround the main assembly plant. 
 One of them is Reyes Industries, a company that makes cots and other equipment for the United States Army. Its owner, Fernando Reyes, is now making plastic parts with the Lear Corporation, one of the country's biggest parts suppliers.
 Mr. Reyes, who is chairman-elect of San Antonio's Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, has taken the manufacturing ideas gleaned from Toyota back to his Army-equipment factory a few miles away. Even though San Antonio already has a solid place in the history and economy of South Texas, Toyota's new plant ''will change San Antonio forever,'' Mr. Reyes said.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise as Airline Bid Buoys Wall St.

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose for a fourth day after US Airways bid $8 billion for Delta Air Lines, touching off a rally in airline shares.
 A midday high in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index above 1,400 for the first time in six years created brief excitement before the index yielded some of the gain and closed 3.43 points below that mark. 
Stocks pared gains after minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve meeting showed that officials were more concerned about inflation than economic growth.
 The Fed minutes damped speculation -- based on comments Tuesday by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, William Poole -- that interest rates might be reduced next quarter.
 The S.& P. 500 added 3.35 points, or 0.24 percent, closing at 1,396.57, and it climbed as high as 1,401.35 midsession. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.70 points, or 0.28 percent, to 12,251.71. The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index gained 12.09 points, or 0.50 percent, to 2,442.75. 
 Delta Air Lines, which has been operating under bankruptcy protection since September 2005, added 5 cents, to $1.52. US Airways rose $8.57, or 16.8 percent, to $59.50.
 AirTran Holdings jumped $1.76, or 15.9 percent, to $12.83. JetBlue Airways added $1.04, or 7.4 percent, to $15.13. Bear Stearns upgraded shares of both companies to outperform from peer perform, citing the ''increasing probability of major capacity reductions'' if there were a US Airways purchase of Delta.
 Southwest Airlines, the most profitable United States carrier, rose 70 cents, or 4.6 percent, to $15.94.
 Elsewhere in the market, AT&T led a slump in phone company stocks, the worst performers among 10 industry groups in the S.& P. 500 since the Democrats took control of the House and Senate in last week's elections. 
 There is some concern that Congress may delay regulatory approval of AT&T's $78 billion purchase of BellSouth until next year.
 AT&T shares fell 50 cents, to $32.46. BellSouth slid 56 cents, to $42.36.

HEADLINE: Beyond Insurance: Weighing the Benefits of Driving vs. the Total Costs of Driving

BYLINE: By HAL R. VARIAN. 
Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
Suppose that Adam runs a stop sign and hits Eve, who happened to be driving through the same intersection. Who caused the accident?
 If Adam were not there, the accident would have not happened. So it seems natural to say that he was the cause. But it is equally true that if Eve were not there, the accident could not have happened either. So, in a sense, Eve caused the accident as well. Adam might have been negligent, but if either party were absent, there would have been no accident.
More generally, the more people on the road, the more accidents will occur, at least up to the point of total gridlock. Even adding an obsessively safe driver to the road could increase total accident costs, since reckless drivers like Adam would now have one more car to run into. 
 When Eve decided whether to buy a car, she was forced to consider the average costs of accidents in which she could be involved since she had to pay for automobile insurance, and insurance rates by necessity reflect the average costs of accidents. But her insurance premiums did not include the costs that other drivers might incur by running into her.
 If the number of accidents increases as the number of cars per mile of road increases, then adding a new car to the road will increase the expected accident costs for existing drivers. The new driver has to pay for the expected accident costs she may incur (via her insurance premium) but not for the increase in accident costs that her presence creates for other drivers on the road.
 Economists say that the new driver imposes an ''external cost'' on the other drivers. Since drivers only face their own cost of accidents in their insurance premiums, they don't face the full cost of their driving, which should include the costs they impose on others.
 How big is this external cost? This is the question investigated by Aaron S. Edlin, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and Pinar Karaca-Mandic, an economist at the RAND Corporation, in a recent paper, ''The Accident Cost From Driving,'' published in the Journal of Political Economy and also available at http://works.bepress.com/aaron--edlin/21/.
 The critical factor affecting accident costs turns out to be traffic density. In states where there are few cars per mile of road, the external accident costs are much less than in states with more congested roads. The authors estimate that an additional driver increases statewide insurance costs in California by $1,725 to $3,239, depending on the method used for the estimate. The comparable number for North Dakota is about $10.
 In an economist's ideal world, the benefits of driving should be compared with the total costs of driving, which include both the costs borne by the driver and the external costs that the driver imposes on others. In economics jargon, the external cost should be ''internalized.''
 Mr. Edlin and Ms. Karaca-Mandic estimate that internalizing those external costs nationwide would require a substantial tax on driving, on the order of $220 billion a year. In California alone, such a tax would raise around $66 billion. By comparison, the state income and sales tax revenues for California in 2004 were about $72 billion.
 On the other hand, drivers in states like North Dakota with low traffic density would have negligible driving tax rates since the presence of an additional car in such places has almost no effect on the accident rates.
 Internalizing the accident cost of driving would require a tax that varies with both traffic density and the amount of driving a person does. The obvious candidate would be a local gasoline tax. 
 But a gas tax is not ideal since good and bad drivers would be charged the same rate per gallon. One could also consider a tax on insurance premiums, which generally take driving records into account. Of course, a combination of taxes would be possible as well.
 Unfortunately, the political support for such measures is virtually nil. This is understandable. People have made decisions on where to live and how far they are willing to commute based on the current costs of operating vehicles, and a dramatic change in the cost of operation would be extremely unpopular.
 Still, one might consider taking some modest steps toward making drivers face the full costs of their decisions. A moderate increase in the gasoline tax whose proceeds were plowed back into mass transit might be politically palatable. Driving during commuting hours in New Jersey and California isn't very pleasant, and many drivers may prefer fast and convenient public transit.
 Many commentators have called for a higher gasoline tax to discourage the use of oil. Some are motivated by environmental concerns and some by international politics. The proposal has gained little traction since the payoffs for reducing gasoline consumption seem distant and uncertain. Accident costs of driving give yet another reason to try to reduce our oil dependence. But unlike the other reasons, the payoff for driving less should have an immediate and concrete effect: fewer accidents.

HEADLINE: Deficit Falls At Agency That Insures Pensions 

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
The federal agency that insures private pension plans for millions of Americans logged a deficit of $18.1 billion this year, a big improvement from last year, helped by a new provision related to the airline industry. 
 The agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, said its deficit for the 2006 fiscal year was down from a shortfall of $22.8 billion in 2005 and a record $23.3 billion in 2004.
''The P.B.G.C.'s financial condition appears to have stabilized for the time being,'' said Vince Snowbarger, the interim director of the agency, which insures pensions for 44 million workers and retirees.
 The agency disclosed in its annual financial report that as of Sept. 30 it had assets of $60 billion to cover liabilities of $78.1 billion.
 The pension agency attributed the shrinking deficit mainly to a provision in the new pension law that carves out special treatment for the airline industry, giving airlines that are in bankruptcy court and have frozen their pension plans extra time for their pension plans to become financially viable.
 The agency said that provision led to a sharp reduction in probable liabilities on its balance sheet.
 The agency said it was responsible for the pension benefits of 1.3 million workers and retirees this year, reflecting no net change from last year. The amount of benefits paid increased to $4.1 billion this year from $3.7 billion last year. The amount is projected to rise to $4.8 billion next year.
 The benefit corporation was created in 1974 as a government insurance program for traditional defined-benefit pension plans. Companies that sponsor these traditional pension plans pay insurance premiums to the agency. If a company is unable to meet its pension obligations, the agency takes over the plan and pays promised benefits up to certain limits.
 Traditional pension plans are still underfunded but not by as much as in the past, the agency said. Those pensions now are underfunded by $350 billion, compared with $450 billion last year. Higher interest rates, a better-performing stock market, improved credit ratings and better plan funding by some companies were among the factors that helped to narrow the gap, economists said.

HEADLINE: Keeping Inflation in Check Remains Top Fed Concern

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
Keeping the economy from overheating with inflation remains the top concern of Federal Reserve policy makers, minutes of their most recent deliberations show.
 The record of their meeting on Oct. 24 and 25, released Wednesday, revealed that in their discussions about the economy's health and even as they decided to hold interest rates steady, the members of the Federal Open Market Committee worried somewhat more about the risk of inflation than about the danger of the economy cooling down too much.
''All members agreed that the risks to achieving the anticipated reduction in inflation remained the greatest concern,'' the Fed minutes said. 
 The minutes also revealed that Fed policy makers debated the pros and cons of ''inflation targeting'' -- numerically defining acceptable bounds for inflation. No decisions were reached and the discussion was expected to be resumed at the Fed's first meeting of 2007, in late January.
 Ben S. Bernanke, who took over as Fed chairman in February, succeeding Alan Greenspan, favors the notion of an inflation target and believes it would help the central bank communicate more effectively with Wall Street and Main Street.
 Even with their concern about inflation risks, Fed policy makers still stuck to their forecast that slowing economic growth and a calming of once-surging energy prices would eventually lessen inflation pressures.
 ''Nearly all members expected that the economy would expand close to or a little below its potential growth rate and that inflation would ebb gradually from its elevated levels,'' the minutes stated.
 Some recent inflation gauges released since the Fed's October meeting have suggested that inflation is settling down.
 The government reported on Tuesday that wholesale prices fell by a record 1.6 percent in October. The government will release a report on consumer prices on Thursday.
 Although substantial uncertainty continued to attend the Fed's outlook, ''most members judged that the downside risks to economic activity had diminished a little, and likewise, some members felt that the upside risks to inflation had declined, albeit only slightly,'' the minutes said.
 The October session was the third Fed meeting in a row where a key interest rate was held steady at 5.25 percent.
 Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., was the lone dissenter at all three meetings. Mr. Lacker said he would have preferred that the Fed increase interest rates by one-quarter percentage point.
 The minutes said that Mr. Lacker believed such action was necessary to ensure that core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, ''declines to an acceptable rate in coming quarters.''
 At the October meeting, the Fed did not rule out another rate increase. Still, many economists predict the central bank will leave rates alone once again when it meets next on Dec. 12.
 The Fed's goal is to slow the economy sufficiently to thwart inflation but not so much as to cripple economic activity.
 Until halting its rate-raising campaign in August, the Fed had raised interest rates 17 times since June 2004 to fend off inflation.
 In the summer, economic growth slowed to a 1.6 percent pace, the most sluggish in more than three years. The housing slump was a main factor in the slowdown.
 Fed policy makers said the housing slump was likely to remain a ''substantial drag on economic growth over the next few quarters.'' However, many believed that the housing slowdown was ''likely to be no more severe than they had previously expected and that the risk of an even larger contraction in this sector had ebbed.''

HEADLINE: Which School Is Right for My Child?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Leaving the City for the Schools, and Regretting It'' (front page, Nov. 13):
It's no surprise that a public school education would not pass muster with modern-day super-parents. 
 Today's schools have an increasingly broad-based directive. They must comply with tougher state standards while meeting the needs of more children with special education issues; teach English as a second language; and offer enrichment opportunities. 
 Ironically, despite such a huge mandate, government financing does not increase apace. No wonder parents turn to boutique private schools to find a more individually tailored educational program. 
 For most, however, public school works. Our three children are students thriving in the very Yorktown Central School District mentioned in your article. Ten years ago, we, too, made the difficult decision to leave New York City and test the waters of suburbia. Our children run a wide gamut in abilities but have encountered a responsive and versatile school district. 
 Along the way, we have found that it helps to be vested partners in our children's education, through regular communication with personnel and active involvement in parent-teacher associations.
 Education, by its very nature, is a subjective experience for every parent and child.

Terry Keller Naumann

To the Editor:
 In the quest for the best education for their children, parents are learning, to their dismay, that long-held assumptions about schools often turn out to be wrong. 
 Their disappointment arises largely from the common belief that suburban schools are consistently better than urban schools, and that private schools are intrinsically superior to public schools. 
 Neither view stands up to scrutiny. Whether schools are private or public, suburban or urban, the major determinants of educational quality are the social, economic and cultural backgrounds of parents. When these factors are accounted for, similarities of schools in a particular community tend to overwhelm differences.
 There is no guarantee that parents will find an ideal match for the specific needs and interests of their children anywhere. But the likelihood is enhanced if they keep these facts in mind.

Walt Gardner
Los Angeles, Nov. 13, 2006

The writer taught for 28 years in the Los Angeles Unified School District and was a lecturer in the U.C.L.A. Graduate School of Education.

To the Editor:
 It is very naive for parents to think that public schools in high performing school districts can be compared to private school education. 
 Public schools will never be a reasonable substitute for private schools. They can't possibly be if public schools include children with learning and behavioral issues whom private schools are not required to accept. 
 If you can't afford to send your child to private schools, any school district will fit the bill as long as you are willing to support your child with your time. 
 Instead of complaining about what your school hasn't taught your children, take the initiative and teach them yourself. Learning does not happen only in school.

Angie Lin
Chappaqua, N.Y., Nov. 13, 2006

To the Editor:
 How sad is it that a parent turned into a ''neurotic mess'' when she learned that her kindergartner thought school time was playtime. 
 As parents of two children, who both went to public schools here in New Jersey and then on to a non-elite college and an Ivy League school, we can tell you that we are most proud of the fact that they are fine, well-adjusted adults who are not only smart but who also still know how to play.
 We hope this parent can calm down and enjoy this great time in a child's life.

To the Editor:
 I read your article about the shortcomings some have found in suburban public schools and would like to present a contrary view based on my very recent interactions with my daughters' teachers in the Millburn, N.J., public school system. 
 My fifth grader was out sick on Monday. Her homework was brought to our house by a friend of hers, but my daughter did not understand the assignments. I e-mailed her English teacher at 4:30 p.m. to ask her for advice on how I could better explain the homework to my daughter. Three minutes later, the teacher replied that she would call my house herself and explain the assignment to my daughter. Her math teacher replied to a similar e-mail within an hour. 
 I can't imagine teachers being more responsive, whether in public or private schools. What happened on Monday accords with my experience over the years in the Millburn schools. 
 The teachers really do care, and it shows.

HEADLINE: Texas Lawmakers Put New Focus on Illegal Immigration

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
In a sign of rising passions over immigration issues, Texas lawmakers prepared for the 2007 session this week by filing a flurry of bills that would deny public assistance and other benefits to the children of illegal immigrants, tax money transfers to Mexico and the rest of Latin America and sue the federal government for the costs of state border control. 
 At the same time, a Dallas suburb, Farmers Branch, became the first Texas municipality to enact measures fining landlords who rent to illegal immigrants, authorizing the police to seek certification to act on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security and declaring English the city's official language. 
Many of the bills are unlikely to become law, but, combined with the Farmers Branch action, they have raised questions about whether Texas, where almost a third of the population was listed as Hispanic in the 2000 census, is about to get caught up in the kinds of legal fights about illegal immigration that have occurred elsewhere.
 ''It's awful,'' said Brent A. Wilkes, the national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the nation's largest and oldest Hispanic rights group. ''Texas for a long time has avoided this anti-immigrant hysteria.''
 But some Texas officials said the time had come for the state to crack down on illegal immigration because the federal government had chosen not to do so.
 ''Want to know what it's all about?'' asked State Representative Burt R. Solomons, a Republican from Carrollton, outside Dallas, who introduced a bill to deny state licenses to people without proof of legal residence. ''Absolute frustration.'' 
 ''If they get a license or permit, they ought to be here legally,'' Mr. Solomons said. ''What's wrong with that? I don't think it's draconian.'' 
 Mr. Solomons also filed a resolution to put the House on record, as he put it, as ''demanding the federal government do what they're supposed to'' to control the border with Mexico and to authorize the state attorney general to sue Washington to recoup the state's costs.
 Monday was the first day members of the Texas House and Senate, who convene every two years, could file bills for the coming session. At least 9 of the first 325 or so bills, as posted on the legislative Web site, dealt with immigration. 
 Perhaps the most sweeping, proposed by Representative Leo Berman, a Republican from Tyler, would deny state benefits, including welfare payments, food stamps, disability payments and public housing and unemployment assistance to the children of illegal immigrants. The children, if born in the United States, are American citizens. 
 An earlier version of the bill would also have denied the children schooling and health care, rights affirmed as basic constitutional guarantees by a divided United States Supreme Court in 1969. Mr. Berman said he removed those provisions to gain passage of the measure in Texas with the goal of leading to another Supreme Court review.
 ''We want to see if that law is still applicable today,'' he said. ''The environment is totally changed.''
 Mr. Berman also proposed a bill that would impose an 8 percent tax on electronic money transfers from immigrant workers in the state to people in Mexico and Central and South America, although it is not clear whether federal law would allow it. 
 Another Republican representative, Dianne White Delisi, from Temple, introduced a bill to require state agencies to report the cost of services like hospital care provided to illegal immigrants. Ms. Delisi said some figures suggested a rise of 77 percent in unpaid hospital care in Harris County, which includes Houston, over the last three years. But, she said, ''the bottom line in Texas is we don't know.'' 
 The housing ordinance in Farmers Branch, adopted on a 5-to-0 vote by the City Council, requires landlords to demand proof of legal residency from all renters, with violations punishable by fines of $500 per tenant for each day of violation. The preamble says the action was taken ''in response to the widespread concern of future terrorist attacks following the events of Sept. 11, 2001.''
 It prompted quick opposition from landlords who protested that they were ill-equipped to police the immigration status of their tenants, and from Hispanic activists who said they would challenge the measure in court.
 On Tuesday, two other towns, Taneytown in central Maryland and Pahrump in southern Nevada, passed measures declaring English the official language. Hazleton, Pa., enacted a similar ordinance in July, but it has been held off pending a court challenge.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 21, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about immigration issues in Texas, including bills to deny state benefits to illegal immigrants and their children, referred incorrectly to a Supreme Court decision on constitutional guarantees to children of illegal immigrants and misstated its date. Ruling against the City of Tyler, the court said that denying schooling to such children was a violation of the 14th Amendment's equal protection guarantee; it did not include health care as a constitutional right. The decision was in 1982, not 1969.

HEADLINE: Agriculture Mainstay Gets an Urban Face

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS 

 BODY:
The number of family farms in America is dwindling, as is the number of young people who say they hope to take over their parents' farms. So the National FFA Organization, once known as the Future Farmers of America, would seem doomed to a parallel fate.
 But a swarm of blue corduroy jackets, not so different from the jackets the Future Farmers wore in the 1930s, seemed to fill every street corner of this city's downtown in October for the FFA's national convention, which the group says has grown into the largest annual student gathering in the nation.
The Future Farmers declined precipitously as the country's farm economy fell into crisis. But the group, which for nearly 80 years bound together farm youths in the country's most isolated parts, has swelled by more than 100,000 members over the last decade and a half.
 A new face has emerged on this old-fashioned tradition. More FFA members now come from towns, suburbs and city neighborhoods, including Queens and the South Side of Chicago, than from rural farm regions, FFA officials say. The largest chapter in the country? At W. B. Saul High School of Agricultural Sciences in Philadelphia. 
 Mainly, the FFA, created to build pride among young farmers-to-be, is drawing students who say they do not in the least wish to become farmers, but rather food industry scientists, seed bioengineers, landscapers and renewable fuels engineers. 
 Awards at the national convention were offered not just for students deemed the best at keeping up wheat crops or tending to hogs, but also to those who presented science research like an examination of the effects of ethanol on small gasoline engines, a top ''agri-entrepreneur'' who sold soaps in her California city, and to a boy who worked at his local country club and beat out a half-dozen other state champions in ''turf grass management.'' 
 The shift at FFA (whose leaders officially dumped the word ''Farmers'' from their name in 1988, saying FFA was more appropriate to their broader audience) may be a perfect reflection of the broader changes in the nation's farm economy, agricultural economists say.
 ''No, no, I don't mess with animals,'' said Ryan Jameson, the president of an FFA chapter in Chicago, when asked if he knew how to milk a cow. Mr. Jameson, 17, said he hoped to study economics in college, then work in the food industry.
 Lucille Shaw, the FFA adviser at Mr. Jameson's school, the Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences, said the school had a working farm on 39 acres, a rare sight inside the city limits. 
 ''But you ask any of my kids -- we do not associate FFA with farming,'' Ms. Shaw said. ''It's a total misconception. It's so, so, so much more than that.''
 In the crush of students filling the convention center in Indianapolis, there were sights one might expect at an FFA convention: minitractor races by remote control and science displays on the effects of hurricane storm surges on Gulf Coast farm equipment and a look at pH levels in cow urine. But mixed among all the blue jackets bearing the names of chapters from places like Taylorsville, Ky., and Nebraska City were jackets that read Philadelphia, New York and 9 others among the nation's 20 most populous cities.
 ''There's no doubt, we stand out,'' said Mr. Jameson, who pointed out that his Chicago chapter consists largely of blacks. Although the FFA has always accepted blacks, some Southern states did not include them until 1965 (before then they had a separate organization), said Bill Stagg, a spokesman for FFA, and the organization did not allow girls national membership until four years after that. 
 The group remains about 81 percent white, but Hispanic members are now estimated at 12 percent, blacks 4 percent. Girls now account for 38 percent of the members.
 This is all, in a way, an unlikely shift, given where Future Farmers began. 
 In 1928, 33 students from 18 states established Future Farmers of America during a national livestock judging contest, said Debra Brookhart, who tends the FFA's historic archives at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. It was seen as a way to help farm boys focus on agricultural education and stick with farming. In part, it was meant to counter a sense some rural leaders had that their youths were feeling inferior about being farmers. 
 ''Especially is this true when the farm boy goes to the city and has to compete with his city cousin,'' Walter S. Newman, a Virginia agriculture educator, said in the 1920s, as he pressed for such an organization. ''In this way, they will develop confidence in their own ability and pride in the fact that they are farm boys.''
 And so, over the years, Future Farmers was braided into the culture of generations in rural areas. As Travis Winters, 16, of Joliet, Mont., lassoed a dummy steer on the convention floor, he noted that his parents had been in the organization, and a grandparent before that. 
 The clean-cut Future Farmers image popped up in books and songs (like ''I'm in Love With a Boy of the FFA,'' which was performed at the 1951 convention and promised that ''those big city slickers can't compare with a certain lad I know'').
 ''All my buddies were in FFA,'' said Ben Alsum of Randolph, Wis., a community of fewer than 2,000. ''If I didn't join, I would have been a loser.''
 But students in the suburbs and cities said their initial sense of FFA was either nonexistent -- or a distinctly country, slightly corny, cultural image. 
 ''Some people haven't gotten over that, but I tell anyone who laughs'' that the organization does not even include the word 'Farming' in its title any longer, said Sarah Caltabiano, 18, and now in college, who joined FFA in Queens at John Bowne High School in Flushing.
 The number of farms has dropped from nearly seven million in the 1930s to about two million, according to federal figures. And farm jobs have dropped from more than 21 percent of the nation's employment in 1930 to less than 2 percent.
 Even as the number of farmers has dipped, those who process agriculture's raw materials have expanded greatly, said Peter F. Orazem, a professor of economics at Iowa State University. And the echo of that larger shift is felt in places like the FFA. Among the booming fields FFA members now say they aspire to work in are food science, renewable energies, genetic engineering of food and seed, environmental law, nutrition, and even the prevention of agricultural bioterrorism.
 The FFA reached its highest membership in 1977 with 509,735 people. Then came the farming crash. By 1992, the group had fewer than 383,000 members. 
 ''You had family farms, family lifestyles, family histories that were collapsing in the middle of the 1980s,'' said Mr. Stagg, the FFA spokesman. ''The advice from nearly any mom and dad was to steer clear of agriculture.''
 In recent years, though, the group has been climbing back, along its changed path. More than 495,000 members were logged this year.
 Most students and advisers here said they were relieved to see the FFA's resurgence, even if it meant dropping the word -- and the notion -- ''Farmer.'' 
 But a few people, mainly from smaller places, admitted quietly that they wondered sometimes whether the influence of the suburbs and the cities might change this tradition too much. 
 ''Farming was what Future Farmers was all about in my time, and that was a good thing,'' said Tim Ostrem, an FFA member from the 1970s and a corn and bean farmer in South Dakota. ''But what are you going to do?'' Mr. Ostrem said his son, who was in the FFA in high school, was studying to become an agricultural engineer.

HEADLINE: Milton Friedman, Nobel Prize-Winning Economist, Dies at 94

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Milton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist who advocated an unfettered free market and had the ear of three U.S. presidents, died Thursday at age 94.
 Friedman died in San Francisco, said Robert Fanger, a spokesman for the Milton and Rose D. Friedman Foundation in Indianapolis. He did not know the cause of death.
"Milton's passion for freedom and liberty has influenced more lives than he ever could possibly know," said Gordon St. Angelo, the foundation's president and CEO, said in a statement. "His writings and ideas have transformed the minds of U.S. presidents, world leaders, entrepreneurs and freshmen economic majors alike." 
 In more than a dozen books and a column in Newsweek magazine, Friedman championed individual freedom in economics and politics.
 His theory of monetarism, adopted in part by the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations, opposed the traditional Keynesian economics that had dominated U.S. policy since the New Deal. He was a member of Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board.
 His work in consumption analysis, monetary history and stabilization policy earned him the Nobel in economics in 1976.
 "He has used a brilliant mind to advance a moral vision -- the vision of a society where men and women are free, free to choose, but where government is not as free to override their decisions," President Bush said in 2002. "That vision has changed America, and it is changing the world."
 Friedman favored a policy of steady, moderate growth in the money supply, opposed wage and price controls and criticized the Federal Reserve when it tried to fine-tune the economy.
 A believer in the principles of 18th century economist Adam Smith, he consistently argued that individual freedom should rule economic policy. Outspoken and controversial, Friedman saw his theories attacked by many traditional economists such as Harvard's John Kenneth Galbraith.
 In an essay titled "Is Capitalism Humane?" he said that "a set of social institutions that stresses individual responsibility, that treats the individual...as responsible for and to himself, will lead to a higher and more desirable moral climate."
 Friedman acknowledged that "pure capitalism" did not exist, but said that nations that cherished freedom must strive to keep the economy as close to the ideal as possible.
 He said government should allow the free market to operate to solve inflation and other economic problems. But he also urged adoption of a "negative income tax" in which people who earn less than a certain amount would get money from the government.
 He lived to see free market reforms spread in the former communist world and Latin America, but played down his own influence.
 "I hope what I wrote contributed to that, but it was not the moving force," Friedman told The New York Sun in March 2006. "People like myself, what we did was keep these ideas open until the time came when they could be accepted."
 Outspoken and controversial, Friedman saw his theories attacked by many traditional economists such as Harvard's John Kenneth Galbraith.
 Born in New York City on July 31, 1912, Friedman began developing his economic theories during the Great Depression when President Franklin D. Roosevelt's based his New Deal on the ideas of Britain's John Maynard Keynes, the most influential economist of the time.
 Keynes argued that the government should intervene in economic affairs to avoid depressions by increasing spending and controlling interest rates.
 Friedman graduated from Rutgers University in 1932 and earned his master's degree the following year at the University of Chicago.
 After working for the National Resources Commission in Washington from 1935 to 1937, Friedman was a member of the staff of the National Bureau of Economics Research in New York from 1937 to 1945 and received his doctorate from Columbia University in 1946.
 After World War II, he taught at the University of Minnesota, then returned to the University of Chicago. He became a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in 1977.
 Friedman married Rose Director in 1938. They had two children, Janet and David, and she was co-author of some of his books.
 Among his most famous books were: "Price Theory," 1962 (with Rose Friedman); "Capitalism and Freedom," 1962 (with Anna J. Schwartz); "An Economist's Protest," 1972; "There Is No Such Thing As a Free Lunch," 1975; "Price Theory," 1976; and "Free to Choose," 1979, co-authored with his wife. "Free to Choose" also was a series on the Public Broadcasting Service.
 Friedman wrote columns for Newsweek from 1966 to 1983 and was one of the few economists to bridge the gap between academia and the public. He involved himself in political campaigns, supporting Barry Goldwater in 1964 and Richard Nixon in 1968. He served on Nixon's commission for an All-Volunteer Army in 1969 and 1970.
 In an interview with Playboy magazine in 1973, later republished in a collection of his essays titled "Bright Promises, Dismal Performance," Friedman said he was encouraged by an apparent trend away from government control.
 "There are faint stirrings and hopeful signs," he said. "Even some of the intellectuals who were most strongly drawn to the New Deal in the '30s are rethinking their positions, dabbling just a little with free-market principles. They're moving slowly and taking each step as though they were exploring a virgin continent. But it's not dangerous. Some of us have lived here quite comfortably all along."
 Friedman, whose wit made him a popular guest on radio and television shows, appeared to enjoy sparring with other economists.
 In the Playboy interview, he referred to his disagreement with Galbraith, who endorsed wage and price controls. When Nixon went against Friedman's advice and reluctantly imposed the controls in an effort to slow inflation, Friedman said he wrote a note to Galbraith.
 "You must be as chagrined as I am to have Nixon for your disciple," Friedman wrote. Galbraith didn't reply, Friedman said.

HEADLINE: US AIRWAYS SEEKS TO ACQUIRE DELTA IN BID TO BE NO. 1 

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN; Reporting was contributed by Clifford Krauss, Micheline Maynard, Peter Edmonston, Charles Duhigg, Christopher Elliott, Jeremy W. Peters and Michael J. de la Merced.

 BODY:
US Airways made an $8 billion offer for Delta Air Lines yesterday in an effort to become the largest airline in the world and dominate travel on the East Coast of the United States.
 The surprise offer may presage a wave of mergers in the struggling airline industry. While consolidation of companies often leads to higher prices, it is unclear at this point whether this merger would do anything like that.
But any deal for Delta would have to overcome high hurdles, including antitrust scrutiny and a lack of support from Delta's management, which rebuffed advances from US Airways this summer.
 In an unusual tack, the unsolicited offer is being made to the creditors of Delta, which is operating under bankruptcy protection -- a process that will give Delta management control over any plan to get out of bankruptcy for at least several more months. 
 Delta said yesterday that it would review the offer. Delta is now the fourth-largest domestic airline and US Airways is No. 5. US Airways said the combined carrier would be bigger than the current leader, American Airlines, and would be called Delta Air Lines. It noted that Delta is a ''very, very powerful'' brand worldwide. 
 A deal would presumably be welcomed by many investors and analysts, who maintain that there are too many airlines fighting for razor-thin profits. 
 Since the drop in air travel after the Sept. 11 attacks, nearly all the established carriers have sought bankruptcy protection. US Airways has filed for bankruptcy protection twice since 2002 and has turned itself around through a merger with America West last year.
 This competition among airlines has benefited some passengers. Even as the economy has rebounded and planes are as heavily booked as they have ever been, competition has kept a lid on fares on some popular routes at certain times of the year. That has sliced airlines' profit margin thinner, making mergers -- and the opportunity to pare some of their high costs -- an attractive proposition.
 The offer for Delta changes the calculations for deals to come. It had been widely expected that Delta would find a merger partner after emerging from bankruptcy protection, not before. The airlines that it has code-sharing relationships with now, notably Northwest and Continental, were seen as the most likely partners. 
 US Airways estimated that a merger would save at least $1.65 billion in operating costs annually by combining facilities at some airports, eliminating flights and cutting capacity by about 10 percent. 
 About 50 percent of the routes served by Delta and US Airways overlap, said Daniel Kasper, an airline consultant with LECG.
 Robert W. Mann, a consultant in Port Washington, N.Y., said, ''If the combined companies reduce the number of flights offered in routes where they overlap, you could see higher prices for consumers.'' 
 As a result, any deal can be expected to receive scrutiny from the Justice Department and it might well result in the sale of either the US Airways or the Delta shuttle services connecting New York, Washington and Boston. A merger of the airlines could be among the first to be reviewed in Washington after the Democrats take control of Congress in January. 
 News of the offer drew a mixed reaction from travelers yesterday. While some welcomed the possible combination -- particularly if it ensured the survival of Delta -- others worried about the prospect of higher fares and still lower customer-service levels.
 ''They're taking two poorly performing airlines, especially from a passengers' point of view, and putting them together,'' said Michael J. Grossman, a lawyer from Lexington, Ky., and a Delta frequent flier. ''What you're left with is the lowest common denominator.''
 A regulatory inquiry would not be the only gantlet US Airways would have to run. The first is overcoming resistance from Delta. US Airways' chief executive, W. Douglas Parker, has approached Delta's chief executive, Gerald Grinstein, over the last several months about merging, but was rebuffed, according to letters that US Airways released yesterday. In late September, he tried again. Mr. Grinstein turned him down once more.
 Yesterday, Mr. Grinstein said in a statement, "We received a letter from US. Airways this morning and will, of course, review it.'' Then he added, ''Delta's plan has always been to emerge from bankruptcy in the first half of 2007 as a strong stand-alone carrier.''
 Mr. Parker, a longtime proponent of consolidation, said in an interview yesterday that it was imperative that Delta engage in discussions with US Airways while it was still in bankruptcy protection. ''We need to act on this before they emerge,'' he said.
 Striking a deal with Delta before it comes out of Chapter 11 protection could have major advantages for US Airways. Mr. Parker said that half the projected $1.65 billion in merger savings could not be achieved outside bankruptcy status.
 While in bankruptcy, a company can seek court permission to reject contracts, renegotiate aircraft leases or terminate labor contracts -- powers that US Airways exercised during its stays in Chapter 11.
 But until February, only Delta management can present a plan to take the airline out of bankruptcy. 
 To succeed, US Airways will have to win the support of a significant chunk of Delta's creditors, a group that may include hedge funds that acquired the debt in the secondary markets, and hope that they will put pressure on Delta's management to engage in discussions. 
 GE Commercial Aviation Services, which finances much of the aircraft borrowing in the global industry, could prove to be a powerful player in the discussions because it provided the equivalent of debtor-in-possession financing to Delta at the beginning of its bankruptcy. 
 With enough backing, "it is very possible that, with patience and fortitude, they could get somewhere," said J. Andrew Rahl, head of the bankruptcy group at the law firm of Anderson Kill & Olick. Delta's unsecured debt has recently traded at 40 cents on the dollar, US Airways noted.
 In a sign that creditors welcomed the offer from US Airways, Delta's bonds surged yesterday. The price of its 2009 note rose 21.25 cents, to 61.75 cents on the dollar. Airline stocks, including shares of US Airways, also rose sharply. 
 If enough creditors think that they would do better in a merger than in a stand-alone reorganization, "Delta's going to have a hard time putting a plan out there," said David W. Dykhouse, a partner at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler in New York.
 Wilbur L. Ross Jr., whose investment firm has bought many distressed companies, said that when a company has been in bankruptcy protection as long as Delta, its debt ''starts to move into the hands of the distressed-investment community.'' These investors, many of them hedge funds, are likely to promote rival offers, he said, adding, ''Chances are they would be pushing for an auction.''
 Two of the largest holders of Delta's unsecured claims are the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents Delta pilots.
 Members of Delta's committee of unsecured creditors either did not return calls requesting comment yesterday or declined to comment.
 US Airways said it was offering $4 billion in cash, plus US Airways stock valued at $4 billion at the market close on Tuesday. That price would represent a substantial premium for Delta's creditors, who would own about 45 percent of the combined company. 
 Still, it remains possible that Delta's creditors' committee could end up siding with Mr. Grinstein because it could take regulators far longer to decide whether to permit a US Airways-Delta merger than for Delta to come out of bankruptcy alone, antitrust lawyers said.
 Regulators are likely to look hard at the combined company's prospective dominance on routes into the Southeast; Delta maintains a hub in Atlanta and US Airways has a hub in Charlotte, N.C., antitrust experts noted.
 For instance, US Airways has 19 flights today from La Guardia Airport in New York to Orlando, Fla., and Delta offers 28. From Boston to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., US Airways has 20 flights and Delta has 31.
 And the deal could face an outpouring of criticism from consumers and consumer advocacy groups. Susan Johnson, an auditor from Philadelphia and an elite-level US Airways flier, said yesterday that she was ''concerned about the monopoly this will present for US Airways, and how that will affect pricing.''
 ''Sure, prices will be low initially,'' she said. ''But in the long run, will they increase the cost of their ticket?''
 Mr. Parker, the US Airways chief, said he was confident that the proposed combination would pass muster under antitrust laws.
 Analysts said a merger could result in a leaner, more efficient airline.
 ''Even though airline mergers tend to be messy while employees, cultures and fleet types are integrated,'' said Ray Neidl, an analyst with Calyon Securities, ''in the long term, a merged carrier should benefit in synergies from revenue generation, the ability to cut overhead costs and the probability that marginal hubs would be closed.''
 Not all industry watchers are convinced that consolidation will cure the airline industry's ills. 
 ''Airlines are notoriously risky to operate,'' said Allen Michel, a professor at the Boston University School of Management. ''Far in excess of 100 airlines have gone into bankruptcy since airline deregulation in 1978.''
 Moreover, US Airways has not completed integrating last year's America West combination, ''and it is questionable whether the Delta deal will pass antitrust muster,'' said Professor Michel said. ''Adding these factors to the complexities associated with an ordinary merger increase the odds against success.''
 Labor-management relations are potentially another problem. Both airlines have clashed in recent years with their unions, principally the Air Line Pilots' Association. And both have struggled to cope with low-price competitors like JetBlue and Southwest. 
 For fliers, the deal may mean more routes and frequency in the long term, but it could also create headaches as the companies merge their operations, schedules and frequent-flier mile programs.
 In an e-mail message to members of US Airways' frequent-flier club yesterday, the carrier promised to ''work hard to mitigate transition difficulties,'' like those that occurred after its merger with America West, when many passengers were left confused. In the same message, US Airways tried to emphasize the ''enormous benefits'' of a deal with Delta. 
 The message made no mention of US Airways' plan to cut flight capacity by 10 percent.

HEADLINE: A Story Of Struggle And Hope

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Watching ''Eyes on the Prize'' again was like reminiscing with an old friend or relative about the bad old days that, in some important respects, were also the good old days.
 Already the story so brilliantly told by this masterpiece of documentary filmmaking, the civil rights struggle of the 1950s and '60s, is fading, like the images on old film stock, from our collective consciousness.
It's fantastic to have a memorial to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the National Mall in Washington. But ''Eyes on the Prize'' is the most powerful reminder we have of how broad the struggle was, how many people of great courage -- from small children to very old men and women -- signed on to it, how many of them suffered and sometimes died, and what all of us owe to all of them. 
 ''Eyes on the Prize'' shows us the many tragic byproducts of insane bigotry, like the hanging bodies of blacks who were lynched, their heads and necks forever frozen at grotesque angles. It shows us young whites beating the daylights out of unresisting protesters who had the temerity to take a seat at a segregated lunch counter.
 These are things that should never be forgotten.
 The bigotry of the period was so pervasive it flowed easily from the mouths of people who considered themselves sympathetic to the plight of blacks. A well-groomed, obviously middle-class white woman smiles into the camera and says, ''I have thought for a long time that nigras should be allowed to sit at the counters where we are served downtown.''
 ''Eyes'' first ran in 1987 and is being shown again this fall on PBS. Understated, mostly in black and white, it has lost none of its startling emotional impact. There were moments, as I watched the episodes unfold, when I wanted to jump through the television and throttle somebody. 
 Because of a logistical mix-up on Sept. 4, 1957, Elizabeth Eckford, a 15-year-old black student who dreamed of becoming a lawyer, showed up alone on the first day of the attempted integration of all-white Central High School in Little Rock, Ark. (Eight other students, accompanied by adults, arrived at the school in a group.)Ms. Eckford was met by a mob of whites and a contingent of National Guard soldiers who were determined to keep blacks out of the school.
 The images of this frightened young girl in sunglasses and a white dress surrounded by adults who were all but foaming at the mouth, calling her the worst names, and screaming that she should be killed, lynched, for trying to go to school, never fail to enrage.
 I think of ''Eyes on the Prize'' as a gift from the filmmaker Henry Hampton, whose goal was not just to document the struggle but to show it from the perspective of the people who were there. He once told me: ''You have to get the story right in order to get its meaning. And the way to get it right it is to listen to the people who lived it.''
 Mr. Hampton, who had suffered from polio as a child, died from the effects of lung cancer in 1998. He was only 58.
 For all the hideous occurrences documented in the series -- the murder of Emmett Till, the church bombing in Birmingham that killed four young girls in 1963, the tragic ''freedom summer'' in Mississippi the following year -- there is nevertheless the stirring sense of achievement that runs like a golden thread through the narrative.
 The bad old days were also the good old days in the sense that one can look back at many wonderful things that were associated with the movement -- the iron-willed commitment of so many people, the sense of a great and common endeavor, the lifetime friendships that were forged, and the pride that came from an unwillingness, in even the darkest hours, to accept defeat.
 There are many people now who have never heard of Emmett Till or Roy Wilkins or James Farmer, or the Edmund Pettus Bridge or the 16th Street Baptist Church, which is reason enough to want ''Eyes on the Prize'' to be with us forever.
 Black Americans are far better off in almost every respect than they were in the mid-1960s, thanks in large part to the successes of the movement. But racism and discrimination persist, and there are still substantial disparities between blacks and whites on most indicators of social and economic well-being. There is also much still to be done about the self-inflicted wounds that have hindered the progress of many blacks.
 ''Eyes on the Prize'' is a demonstration that even the greatest challenges can be overcome. It's a national treasure, important for all the reasons that history is important.

HEADLINE: Trade Bills Now Face Tough Odds

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
The Bush administration says it has no higher global economic priority than to combat rising protectionism. This week the challenge became harder and more complicated.
 Like a lightning bolt that illuminates a dark landscape, the failure by the House to pass what should have been a routine measure sought by President Bush to extend normal trade relations with Vietnam shows how much harder it will be to win approval of trade bills from now on.
Administration officials said Wednesday that they still hoped the Vietnam trade bill would be approved by the end of the year in the lame-duck Congressional session that continues to be led by Republicans. They said the same for other bills that would grant trade preferences to poor countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. 
 But after an election in which many winning Democrats ran on promises to look more skeptically at trade measures, Democratic leaders and trade lobbyists agreed that, at least next year, the administration is going to have to adjust to a new environment and make concessions in order to get such bills through a Democratic-controlled Congress.
 Among the concessions might be greater efforts to get trading partners to crack down on sweatshops and labor abuses and to respect environmental standards and other types of regulations in their countries. Trade deals may also have to address what sorts of goods the American government can procure from overseas.
 ''The election was a reaffirmation of public skepticism on trade deals,'' said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, a group founded by Ralph Nader. ''There's going to be a majority for trade deals, but it's going to be a different majority than the one we're used to. The skeptics are going to have a say.''
 This was also the view of groups advocating trade agreements representing big business.
 ''We're optimistic about working with the new Congress, but we're going to have to show some flexibility,'' said Christopher Wenk, director of international trade policy at the National Association of Manufacturers. ''Labor is going to have to play a more prevalent role, and environmental issues are going to have to be addressed.''
 The Vietnam bill passed by a majority, but it fell short of the two-thirds majority needed under special rules invoked to speed its consideration on the eve of Mr. Bush's trip to Hanoi, his first visit to the country with which the United States fought a war a generation ago.
 The result was an embarrassment for the White House, suddenly deprived of a tangible way to prove that relations with Vietnam were improving under Mr. Bush. Even administration officials said they were not sure why the bill failed and seemed ready to blame Republicans as well as Democrats.
 A day after Republican leaders decided not to even try to pass the bill before Mr. Bush's visit, new details of the inner workings of the House bill were emerging. Legislative aides said Republican skeptics of the bill were furious with their leaders that it was being scheduled so soon after an election in which trade was an issue.
 More than 60 Republican voted against the measure, an unusually high number for a party that stands for free trade. Misgivings about improving relations with Vietnam three decades after the war were cited as a factor in their dissent. 
 So was a general feeling of resentment toward Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is outgoing chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, whose style of running the committee is criticized by Republicans and Democrats as autocratic and doctrinaire.
 On the Democratic side, the issue was complicated as well. Democratic leaders like Representatives Nancy Pelosi, set to become House speaker, and Charles B. Rangel, the expected chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, supported the Vietnam bill. Their offices noted that more than 90 Democrats voted for it.
 Mr. Rangel said he would handle trade legislation differently from Mr. Thomas and consult lawmakers about their ideas before the vote. He said trade actually offered more of a prospect for bipartisan cooperation than other issues like taxes, Social Security and Medicare.
 ''With all the other big-ticket items we're facing, trade is one issue that could be more easily dealt with in a bipartisan way,'' Mr. Rangel said in an interview. ''In the past, Republicans never welcomed working with us, except to tell our trading partners that it was the Democrats who were holding up trade deals.''
 Mr. Rangel said, however, that he did not think trading partners would object to the kinds of concerns on labor, environment and other issues that Democrats would be raising. ''I have not heard one representative of any government objecting to any suggestions by Democrats,'' he said.
 Trade officials say that dictating labor, environmental and regulatory standards of American trading partners is not as easy as Mr. Rangel and the Democrats assert in the current environment as European, Latin American and Asian countries are making trade deals with each other that could freeze out the United States.
 ''We do not have the luxury of standing on the sidelines,'' said an administration trade official, asking not to be identified discussing tactics in Congress. ''We have got to be in the game. We have to get preferential access.''
 The Vietnam deal was especially upsetting to the American textile industry, which has been reeling from a succession of trade deals with Mexico, the Caribbean and China over the last 10 years. Some worried that the Vietnam arrangement might allow cheating by China to circumvent curbs on its exports by going through that country.
 Democrats denied Republican claims that they were under pressure from their labor supporters to vote against the Vietnam deal. They said the vote on Monday evening demonstrated that, while about half the Democrats in Congress might vote against future accords -- and indeed most Democrats opposed trade deals even under President Bill Clinton -- there should be enough Democrats to join with Republicans to pass some measures. Whatever happens on Vietnam and the pending deals with poor countries, the vote this week was not seen as good news for a future global trade accord, which is hung up on the issue of farm subsidies and tariffs. 
 The Bush administration has made it clear that it cannot offer to reduce its current level of $20 billion in farm subsidies in return for modest access to European, Indian, Indonesian and Brazilian markets for American goods. Such access seems not to be in the offing, and therefore many trade experts are pessimistic about getting a global deal.

HEADLINE: Bush, in Asia, Faces a Test of Diplomatic Muscle

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Moscow.

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Thursday, Nov. 16 

 BODY:
President Bush arrived here Thursday morning in one of Asia's most prosperous corners, opening a five-day visit that will test whether the Republican defeat last week diminished his influence as he presses other nations to confront Iran and North Korea.
 Stopping Wednesday in Moscow for refueling, Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, had a 90-minute visit with President Vladimir V. Putin, which the White House described as largely social. 
But it included some exchanges on efforts to get Russia to join a resolution imposing United Nations sanctions on Iran for its continued defiance regarding its nuclear program. 
 On the way here, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, acknowledged that the two countries were still well apart on such sanctions.
 ''The issue is just what should be in the resolution,'' Mr. Hadley said after talking to his counterpart, Igor Ivanoff, in Moscow. ''It's a little bit like sausage making -- it's not pretty, and a lot of it spills out into the public. But I think the international community has held together on this issue, and I think we will again.''
 Russia has deep economic ties to Iran's nuclear power program -- it is the supplier of nuclear reactors now under construction -- and it has been the most reluctant to impose sanctions, saying they would undercut efforts to reach a negotiated settlement. Administration officials make little secret of their frustration that the year is coming to a close and Iran is continuing to enrich uranium. 
 Asked about seeking Iran's help with ending violence in Iraq while pressing the nuclear issue, Mr. Hadley said the administration had no intention of letting up the pressure to win Iran's help. ''There's not a tradeoff between the two,'' he said. ''Iran ought to have an interest in having a unified and stable Iraq.''
 In Moscow the Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry S. Peskov, described the meeting of the presidents and their wives as brief but ''very positive.'' He said that among the subjects they took up was an agreement, already announced, for Russia to enter the World Trade Organization.
 When Mr. Bush arrives Friday in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, for an annual Asian summit meeting, he will face a more difficult trade issue: Congress balked at final passage of normal trade relations with Vietnam. 
 Mr. Bush had intended to bring news of the approval with him, but Mr. Hadley said that instead, he would tell Hanoi that he believed the problems in Congress -- some with Mr. Bush's own Republican allies -- would soon be resolved.
 In Hanoi, Mr. Bush is also likely to have a testy encounter with President Roh Moo-hyun of South Korea. Mr. Roh has been critical of what he has called a one-sided American approach to North Korea, and earlier this week, he announced only weak sanctions against North Korea in response to its nuclear test on Oct. 9. 
 So far South Korea has declined to take part directly in the American-led effort to detect and seize illicit weapons shipments. Many North Korean ships pass through South Korean waters. American officials say that Mr. Roh, in a visit to Washington before the nuclear test, had indicated that if North Korea detonated a nuclear test, it would ''change everything'' in relations between North and South.
 One of Mr. Bush's senior national security aides, speaking in Washington before the president left, but declining to talk on the record about the friction between Washington and Seoul, said, ''It seems to have changed almost nothing.''

HEADLINE: Many Say Leadership Race Damages Democrats' Image

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 

 BODY:
House members acknowledged on Wednesday that the increasingly bitter contest for majority leader was sullying the image of unity and new direction that Democrats hoped to convey.
 ''It's four days that we haven't talked about our message and built on the euphoria,'' said Representative Ellen O. Tauscher, a California Democrat who is supporting Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland in the leadership vote on Thursday. ''We had such perfect pitch last week.''
 Downtrodden Republicans were enjoying the spectacle of the split between Representative Nancy Pelosi, the incoming speaker, who is publicly pushing Representative John P. Murtha, her longtime ally, and Democrats rallying behind Mr. Hoyer, who has served in the leadership slot beneath Ms. Pelosi for four years. 
 ''I can't believe they are self-destructing before they even get started,'' said Representative Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois. ''Everyone on our side is giddy.''
 The race has not broken along conventional ideological lines. Mr. Murtha, a staunch conservative on most issues with the exception of his highly publicized opposition to the Iraq war, enjoys support from some of the most liberal Democrats. Mr. Hoyer, the more liberal of the two, has attracted strong backing from moderates and centrists, as well as some of the most seasoned House Democrats.
 It has also left Democrats and Republicans in both the House and Senate straining to understand Ms. Pelosi's strategy. 
 They wonder why, in her moment of victory, she injected herself into a leadership fight that will end with the selection of her rival or her own choice, a lawmaker criticized for his ethics record, after an election in which Democrats campaigned on a clean-government theme.
 Mr. Murtha himself has thrown more fuel on that fire. Members of the conservative Democratic Blue Dog group said that during an appearance before them Tuesday, Mr. Murtha disparaged an ethics overhaul that Ms. Pelosi and the leadership have been promising as one of their first orders of business. 
 Two lawmakers at the session confirmed that the comment, first reported by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call, left many stunned, given the new scrutiny Mr. Murtha's deal-making on the Appropriations Committee has drawn, along with his involvement in the 1980 Abscam bribery sting run by the F.B.I. He was never charged in that case, but a widely circulated film showed him being offered a bribe and responding that he was not interested in the money ''at this time.''
 In an interview on the MSNBC show ''Hardball'' Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Murtha said that at the time of Abscam he was interested in attracting foreign investment to relieve high unemployment in his Pennsylvania district and, though suspicious of the offer, wanted to keep open the possibility of legitimate investment. As for the ethics package promoted by Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Murtha said he was complaining that Congressional wrongdoing was superceding other matters ''when we've got a war going on and we got all these other issues -- $8 billion a month we're spending.''
 After writing a letter of support for Mr. Murtha, Ms. Pelosi has personally gone to bat for him, attending a reception for new members and pressing lawmakers on their choice for majority leader. Her allies say her intervention reflects the sort of risk-taking strategy that has brought her to the brink of becoming speaker. And no matter how it turns out, they say, it will send a message to lawmakers that if they stick with her, she will reciprocate.
 But several Democrats said her direct involvement was clouding the Democratic takeover by showing squabbling Democrats in serious disagreement over the direction of the party.
 ''This is somewhat distracting us,'' Mr. Hoyer conceded Wednesday, even as he predicted that he would win the race and that the party would avoid substantial fallout.
 ''I expect that we will bring the party together and become unified and move on from this,'' he said in a brief interview.
 Mr. Hoyer came in for criticism of his own Wednesday from an outside watchdog group, Public Citizen. It ranked him as a top Congressional recipient of contributions from lobbyists and political action committees, receiving more than $5.6 million in PAC money since 2000. Mr. Murtha collected about half that much.
 ''Both candidates for House leadership have taken large amounts of special interest money,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen.
 Mr. Murtha and his allies have emphasized the role he played in building Democratic opposition to the Iraq war, an issue that was crucial to the party's victories last week. 
 Mr. Hoyer and his supporters acknowledge the import of Mr. Murtha's turnaround after his initial support of the war. Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts described it as a ''Nixon goes to China moment,'' but said it did not entitle Mr. Murtha to the leadership post.
 Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, a liberal Democrat from Ohio who disagrees with Mr. Murtha on major social issues like abortion and gun control, said in a letter distributed to his colleagues that Mr. Murtha's leadership on the war outweighed other considerations.
 ''We need Jack Murtha for majority leader,'' Mr. Kucinich wrote, ''because at a critical moment on the major international policy issue facing America and the world, he showed an openness, a readiness to listen and a willingness to set a new direction, based on new information. This is the mark of someone who moves forward with courage.''

HEADLINE: Lowdown on War Veterans, Seasoned Anchor in High-Def

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN

 BODY:
When it comes right down to it, one solid commercial-free hour is a lot of television. And ''Dan Rather Reports'' on HDNet is a lot of high-definition television news. It's also a lot of high-definition Dan Rather. 
 Still, the premiere on Tuesday of ''Dan Rather Reports'' on Mark Cuban's new digital cable network was unusually compelling, perhaps because it seemed like such an onslaught. 
In other words, in case you miss Mr. Rather in the first frame, there he is again in the second one, and the third, and fourth, and so on; it's the same with his voice in the narration. ''Dan Rather Reports'' is his show through and through: he's a producer, the host, the anchor, all the correspondents, the Andy Rooney and the Katie Couric.
 For that matter, he's also the Jay Leno, the Tyra Banks and the Ellen DeGeneres. Can he really and truly make more than one episode of these?
 The theme of the series premiere is ''Coming Home,'' as in returning from war, though the show's star veteran is -- well, you guessed it. Mr. Rather doesn't have to spell out how seriously he takes a nation's obligation to remembering its greatest heroes, though, as he says, caring for those heroes can sometimes be ''extensive and expensive.'' Uh, yeah.
 Mr. Rather visits L. Tammy Duckworth, a retired Army major who was shot down in Iraq while flying a Black Hawk helicopter. She lost both legs, and her right-leg prosthesis alone costs $100,000. Ms. Duckworth is bright, self-assured, beautiful, patriotic, impressive; she's also a Democrat and critic of the Department of Veterans Affairs. She's perfect for ''Dan Rather Reports,'' which so far seems to favor Democrats who love America. (Ms. Duckworth just lost a close Congressional race in Illinois.) 
 Mr. Rather also interviews a conscientious objector, a veteran with battle fatigue, a Cuban-born combatant who joined the Marines before he had United States citizenship and other figures sympathetic to a left-leaning audience. 
 The individual stories are powerful, and given space to develop without much interference. You realize how effective it can be to let documentary pieces cluster around a theme, instead of mixing hard news with lighter fare in the standard newsmagazine way. 
 Here viewers will emerge with a better sense of how soldiers gear up for each new tour in Iraq, what esprit de corps is like after three and a half years at war and what injured soldiers currently expect when they come home. 
 Sure, these solemn lessons are imparted by Mr. Rather, who manages to smuggle in the odd, disconcerting Ratherism: something about ''tighter than Springsteen's headband.'' And plainly this newsman believes he (above all maybe) deserves extensive and expensive fanfare, his due as a decorated officer who served his nation. 
 But at least his narcissism is energetic. Mr. Rather does not rest on his laurels. ''Dan Rather Reports'' is a commendably entrepreneurial undertaking, as are his other what-the-hey ventures, including his ''Daily Show'' appearance during the recent midterm election night. 
 In other words, instead of waiting to be called to give commencement speeches or appear at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he's pushing for interviews, flying to small towns, explaining to everyone what HDNet is, getting into makeup, recording sound, writing scripts and generally making broadcast news. And he's doing it at 75, when most of us would rather be delivering our own pompous wisdom on a front porch somewhere, without television cameras, high- or low-def, anywhere in sight.

HEADLINE: Hunting, Snowmobiling And Rural Charms

BYLINE: By JULIA LAWLOR

 BODY:
AROUND the time the frost begins to glaze the fields and the last autumn leaves have drifted to the ground, deer-hunting season opens in Norwich, N.Y. As Ossie's Restaurant starts serving breakfast at 4:30 a.m., Mike Mayhood of Mayhood Sporting Goods on Route 12 braces himself for extra-long duty behind the cash register. By day's end, the sports bar at the Howard Johnson's fills with hardy men in hunting clothes. 
 ''They're all in there with their new boots, L. L. Bean flannels and a three-day growth,'' said Deborah DeForest, director of human resources for Norwich. ''You can practically smell the testosterone in the air.''
Norwich, the seat of Chenango County in the Central-Leatherstocking Region of upstate New York, is the hub of a rural and sparsely populated area. With its lakes, rivers, rolling hills and dairy farms, the region has long been known for hunting and fishing. Sixty percent of the county (which covers roughly 900 square miles) is forested, and more than 80,000 acres are open to the public for hunting. 
 Hunters from New York City and Long Island -- many of them firefighters and police officers -- have slowly adopted the county as their playground. More recently, Norwich's subdued beauty has attracted nature lovers who have no interest in spending their days up a tree, waiting to kill a white-tailed deer. They want vistas and lake views at reasonable prices. 
 ''Most people want to be in the country and have acreage, especially if they're from New York City,'' said Linda Parker, a broker for PRK Properties in Norwich. ''The classic line is, 'I want an old farmhouse to redo.' But those are few and far between now.'' 
 Second-home shoppers do a double take, though, when they see a lakefront house for as little as $120,000. ''Compared to the New York City area, we're considered cheap,'' Norwich's mayor, Joseph P. Maiurano, said. 

The Scene
 Dairy farmers were among the first to settle Chenango County in 1798, and dairy farming remains dominant. Cow-crossing and tractor-crossing signs are common on the two-lane roads that connect the county's towns and villages. Some farms also raise alpacas, horses, pigs and beef cattle. 
 Mobile homes, seasonal cabins and hunting shacks are also common, often owned by hunters from downstate. Besides deer, they hunt wild turkeys and other small game, including squirrels, rabbits, grouse, pheasants, ducks and geese.
 Right before deer season, the Iroquois Sportsman's Club near Chenango Lake organizes a squirrel roast, with more than 50 guests contributing a fish or game dish. (There is no consensus, however, on what squirrel tastes like.) 
 Most of the region's lakes and ponds are private, including Guilford Lake, North Pond, Plymouth Reservoir and Chenango Lake. There is a public docking area on Chenango, though, and swimming at Bowman Lake, in Bowman Lake State Park. 
 Hiking is popular, with miles of trails in two state parks and a 72-mile chunk of the Finger Lakes Trail running through Chenango County. In winter, snowmobilers reign, with several north-south routes connecting to the New York State Corridor Snowmobile Trail System. There is cross-country skiing, plus ice fishing on Hunts Pond and Chenango Lake, where everyone bundles up to watch the Perch Derby.
 In Norwich itself, a striking domed courthouse built in 1838 anchors the four-block commercial district. There are many well-preserved Victorian-era homes, antique cars housed in the Northeast Classic Car Museum and a restored movie theater built in 1914.
 Several annual events draw thousands of visitors, including an arts and crafts festival and a pumpkin festival in the fall, music festivals and a county fair. 
 Even so, Norwich and the county have steadily lost population in the last 20 years as manufacturing jobs have disappeared. With a median household income of only $33,650, the county economy still struggles. Norwich's downtown has neither the fine dining nor the chic boutiques that characterize many small resort towns, although newcomers are moving in and trying to liven things up. The big news lately is that a Lowe's home improvement store opened on the outskirts of town last month. 
 Katie and Alex Ives, who own a dairy farm in nearby Guilford, opened Ives Cream Parlor in downtown Norwich in June, using milk from the farm to make their own ice cream. Ms. Ives noted that three new restaurants just opened nearby: a Tex-Mex, a Caribbean/Creole and a barbecue place. ''Something's going on in Norwich,'' she said. 

Pros
 City dwellers are surprised by how friendly local residents are. ''Up there, I can walk right into the mayor's office,'' said Ismael Ortiz, a real estate appraiser from Medford, on Long Island. Mr. Ortiz, who hunts, bought eight acres overlooking Hunts Pond 13 years ago for $15,000 and then spent $150,000 to build an A-frame. He and his wife, Adrienne, plan to retire to Norwich.
 Benjamin Soto and his partner, Ian Dobbie, who live in Brooklyn, spent $189,000 last year on a 23-acre property outside Norwich specifically because they craved privacy. ''We wanted no disturbances from the outside world,'' Mr. Soto said. ''We wanted no neighbors around us at all.'' 
 But the neighbors sought them out, and became friends. ''They brought us pumpkins and baked cookies,'' Mr. Soto said. ''Another neighbor would stop by and tell stories about the farmhouse that used to be here. It's so friendly -- like another Norman Rockwell town.'' 

Cons
 Norwich lacks upscale shopping, and the nearest mall is in Binghamton, almost an hour away. For downhill skiing, you have to drive at least 45 minutes to a ski resort. And some second-home buyers consider the four-hour drive from New York City to be too far. 

The Real Estate Market
 After the closing of a Procter & Gamble facility in Norwich in 1994, many people left the county and a housing glut depressed prices. ''Houses that cost $200,000 were selling for $120,000 or less,'' Ms. Parker of PRK Properties said. It took eight years, she said, for prices to return to previous levels. 
 The median price of houses in Chenango County was $89,000 last September, according to Ms. Parker, up almost 40 percent in five years. But Norwich has not had the big increases that some second-home markets have had, nor has it been part of the recent slowdown in the housing market. ''Our inventory is still low,'' she said. Houses typically sell within 60 days, and most sell for a bit below the asking price. 
 Many buyers looking for vacation or weekend homes have focused on Chenango County, Ms. Parker said, after finding nearby Delaware County too crowded and the prices too high. 
 The most desirable properties are on Chenango and Guilford Lakes and North Pond. Prices start at $120,000 for a seasonal home (suitable between April and October) and go up to $200,000. Lots are usually small. When they want to sell, Ms. Parker said, most owners simply put out the word to neighbors and a buyer soon appears. 
 At the low end are single- and double-wide mobile homes that start at about $30,000. A double-wide mobile home with three bedrooms and two baths on an acre near Plymouth Reservoir is on the market for $59,000. 
 Some buyers are drawn to Aurora Hills, a suburban-style development outside Norwich that has houses on five-acre lots that range from $250,000 to $800,000. Many people are opting to buy land that they will later build on, Ms. Parker said. Twenty years ago, an acre cost $500; now it costs between $1,500 and $3,000. 

LAY OF THE LAND

POPULATION -- Norwich, 7,355; Chenango County, 51,000, according to the Chenango County Chamber of Commerce.
SIZE -- Norwich is two square miles; Chenango County is about 900 square miles.

HEADLINE: Price Index Drops 0.5% A 2nd Time 

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER and JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Consumer prices fell by 0.5 percent for the second consecutive month in October, suggesting that inflation is being contained by declining energy prices and a gradually slowing economy.
 Whether it was a tank of gasoline or the monthly electricity bill, lower energy prices were the main factor driving down the overall price index. But broader prices slowed as well. So-called core inflation -- which excludes fuel and energy -- inched ahead by only 0.1 percent, the slowest pace since February.
Coming after months in which prices rose steadily, a second decline in the Consumer Price Index came as good news to the Federal Reserve, appearing to validate its decision to stop raising interest rates after the last increase in June. 
 Moreover, the inflation data coincided with a report that industrial production -- which includes the output of manufacturers, mines and utilities -- grew 0.2 percent in October, less than most economists expected. 
 Manufacturing output fell 0.2 percent, as the production of automobiles and auto parts dropped 3.9 percent. 
 Declining prices and weak industrial production reduced the odds that the Fed would again have to increase its benchmark interest rate to hold inflation in check. 
 Fed policy makers ''could hardly have scripted a more benign inflation report,'' Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist with PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, said in a report to investors. 
 Falling prices also provided some good news for workers, creating the first substantial boost of real wages in years. After accounting for inflation, hourly wages for blue- and white-collar workers outside management level were 2.8 percent higher in October than a year earlier. 
 This was the biggest annual increase since 1998, when huge investments in Internet-based companies and services increased wages at the fastest pace since the 1970s. On a monthly basis, the 1 percent gain in real wages recorded in both September and October was the fastest in nearly 35 years. 
 ''Finally, some real bona fide wage gains for workers who have been thus far left behind,'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. 
 Just as it drove prices up over much of the last year, energy has been the main factor dragging prices down in the last two months. In October, the price of gasoline fell 11.1 percent, according to the price index, compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price of natural gas and electricity for homeowners fell 2.5 percent. Broadly, energy prices slipped 7 percent in October, after a 7.2 percent decline the month before. 
 But the moderation in prices spread somewhat beyond energy. Clothing costs declined 0.7 percent, and the price of used cars fell 1.2 percent. The rates for hotel rooms were 0.5 percent lower, and airline fares fell 1.4 percent, the third consecutive monthly decline.
 While the slack housing market does not seem to have substantially hampered consumer spending, retail spending was weaker than expected in October. And economists noted that if the housing slump persisted, it could become a bigger drag on economic activity. This would further restrain prices. 
 Still, some economists cautioned that the drop in energy prices since September is likely to have run its course, and prices are unlikely to keep falling.
 Moreover, the prices of some items that have been pushing up core inflation -- like rent, tuition and medical services -- are still rising briskly.
 ''One soft core is not a trend,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist with High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., wrote in a note to investors.
 Perversely, the weak housing market has scared many families away from buying a home and thus increased the demand for rental units. Rents were up 0.4 percent in October, leading to a 3.9 percent rise compared with a year earlier -- the biggest annual increase since mid-2002. 
 The high number of homes for sale could eventually slow the increases in rents when more owners start pushing unsold inventory onto the rental market. Still, Lawrence Yun, a senior economist at the National Association of Realtors, argued that with vacancy rates in multifamily rental buildings still under 5 percent, rents were likely to continue accelerating through the second half of 2007.
 Core inflation remains high -- reported at 2.3 percent over the last three months, on an annualized basis. That is still above the 2 percent threshold that the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has said he is comfortable with.
 The minutes from last month's meeting of the Fed's interest rate-setting committee indicated that Fed governors were concerned that inflation remained too high.
 ''Most participants expected core inflation to moderate gradually,'' the minutes said, ''but they were quite uncertain as to the likely pace and extent of that moderation.''
 The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Michael H. Moskow, echoed those sentiments in a speech yesterday, saying that while inflation had retreated somewhat, it remained the ''dominant concern'' for the Fed. Speaking to reporters in Chicago as quoted by Reuters, Mr. Moskow added, ''It's a bit premature for anyone to say that we have broken the back'' of inflation. 
 Mr. Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute said that the rise in real wages had been driven not by faster nominal wage growth, but by slower price growth. ''So there's no evidence of wage-push inflation,'' he said.
 But Ethan S. Harris, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said the tight labor market was an inflation risk: unemployment is at its lowest in more than five years and labor costs are rising quickly.
 ''The way you stop inflation is by lowering growth and pushing up the unemployment rate,'' Mr. Harris said. ''But the unemployment rate keeps falling.''
 Though they acknowledged that profit margins were big enough for businesses to absorb higher wages without increasing prices, Fed governors at their last meeting noted the risk that rising wages could slow the decline in inflation, according to the minutes.
 Mr. Harris argued that the Fed is still likely to raise interest rates once more next March. At the least, other economists said, until the Fed can be sure that inflation has indeed stabilized -- and until they are convinced that economic growth will remain slow for some time -- they have little incentive to reduce interest rates.
 ''They're not going to be completely won over until they see a more extended moderation in inflation,'' said Paul Ashworth, senior economist with Capital Economics, a research firm based in London. ''And certainly not until it becomes apparent that growth is going to continue on a slower course.''

SIMPSON BOOK -- The publisher of the book from O.J. Simpson, in which he hypothesizes about how he could have committed the 1994 murder of his wife, said that she was told the advance and royalties for the book would go to Mr. Simpson's children, not to him. The publisher, Judith Regan, said she believed the book was ''a confession'' by Mr. Simpson to committing the murders of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. [Page C1] 


MILTON FRIEDMAN DIES -- Milton Friedman, the grandmaster of free-market economic theory in the postwar era and a prime force in the movement of nations toward less government and greater reliance on individual responsibility, died in San Francisco, where he lived. Conservative and liberal colleagues alike viewed Mr. Friedman, a Nobel laureate, as one of the 20th century's leading economic scholars. [A1]

INFLATION FALLS AGAIN -- Consumer prices fell 0.5 percent for the second straight month in October, suggesting that inflation was being contained by falling energy prices and a slowing economy. Excluding energy and food, so-called core inflation inched ahead 0.1 percent, the slowest pace since February. [C1]

FURTHER DROP IN OIL -- Oil prices fell to their lowest level in a year as oil traders expressed doubt that OPEC members would carry out their recent deal to trim production. Crude oil for December delivery fell $2.50 a barrel, to settle at $56.26, the steepest in 15 months. [C4]

STOCKS GAIN -- Wall Street scored a fifth straight gain and the Dow Jones industrials achieved their third straight record close. The Dow rose 54.11 points, or 0.44 percent, to 12,305.82. [C9]

DEPARTMENT STORES ON THE RISE -- From the modest cubicles inside Macy's headquarters in Cincinnati to the spacious corner offices at Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, merchants are beginning to discuss something virtually unheard of in the American department store industry: a comeback. After four decades of decline, executives say the department store has again become a destination for shoppers. [A1]

BUSH IN VIETNAM -- President Bush begins a 72-hour visit to Vietnam, linked to an annual Asian summit for which the Communist government in Vietnam is the host. Following Republican losses in Congressional elections and the deteriorating situation in Iraq, White House officials concede the visit is poorly timed. [A12]

ENERGY IN MYANMAR -- In the balmy waters of the Bay of Bengal, just off the coast of Myanmar, an Asian energy rush is on. Huge pockets of natural gas have been found. China and India are jostling to sign deals. Plans are afoot to spend billions on new ports and pipelines. Yet onshore not a light is to be seen. People receive two hours of electricity a day from a military government that is among the world's most repressive. [A1]

MEDIA FIRMS IN PRIVATE HANDS -- Some of the largest broadcasters and publishers are being swept into the arms of private equity firms. The trend could raise new regulatory concerns, however, as some of the big private equity firms start to weave a complex web of cross-ownerships in the industry. The latest example is Clear Channel Communications, which has agreed to be acquired for $18.7 billion by Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital. [C1]

CITIGROUP'S CHINA BANK DEAL -- A group of investors led by Citigroup reached a deal to pay about $3.1 billion for a controlling stake in the Guangdong Development Bank, the first time a foreign-led consortium has won the right to manage a major Chinese bank. The deal came after more than a year of intense negotiation with the Chinese government and a contentious bidding war. [C9]

HEWLETT-PACKARD PROFIT -- In a quarter in which it struggled with revelations about corporate spying, Hewlett-Packard still managed to post sharp gains in profit and revenue. Net income for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Oct. 31 rose 27 percent to $1.7 billion, or 60 cents a share, from adjusted amounts a year earlier. Revenue increased 7 percent. [C4]

ICAHN BID FOR RECKSON -- Days before shareholders of Reckson Associates Realty were scheduled to vote on the company's sale to another publicly traded Midtown office landlord, the investor Carl C. Icahn and the privately held Macklowe Properties have submitted a $4.6 billion offer that tops the earlier bid. [C7]

Broadway

'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it(2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included). Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called ''Little'' Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (as her bed-ridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)

'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to a demonstration, with partners including a vulture who sings ''My Way,'' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'LES MISERABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood-style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'LOSING LOUIE' This second-rate English import depicts the impact of an adulterous liaison on two generations of a family in Pound Ridge. Directed by Jerry Zaks, it's a queasy mixture of coarse comedy and soap opera contrivances (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, , are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'ALL THE WAY HOME' The play won a Pulitzer Prize, but in this revival by the Transport Group it is Sandra Goldmark's simple, striking set that first gets your attention, and then keeps refocusing it during a show that runs almost three hours. Amid her doll-size houses, the human actors seem like giants, but as the play progresses, it becomes apparent that the characters they play are anything but. The acting is excellent, though the play, centered on a small domestic tragedy, doesn't have the punch it once did (1:35). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger)

'ALL TOO HUMAN' Henry Miller's one-man show about Clarence Darrow is far from scintillating theater, but it's relevant. (1:35) 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)

'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger)

'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)

*'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'esoterica' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE HAIRY APE' The Irish Repertory Theater has put together a startling production of Eugene O'Neill's tale of a galoot called Yank who goes looking for his place in the world, one that vividly conveys what a gut-punch this work must have been when it was first seen in 1922. Eugene Lee's set is something to see, and the soundscape, by Zachary Williamson and Gabe Wood, is something to hear (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Gates)

'LIVE GIRLS' Victoria Stewart's drama sends up the docudrama and an Anna Deavere Smith-like performance artist (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)

'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's delicate play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)

'MIMI LE DUCK' This musical, seen in 2004 at the New York International Fringe Festival, has morphed into a campy celebration of Eartha Kitt, who, just short of her 80th birthday, milks a minor role gleefully. The main order of business, though, is a middle-aged, middle-American housewife (Annie Golden), who, at the urging of Hemingway's ghost, goes to Paris in search of her true self. Diana Hansen-Young, who wrote the book and lyrics, seems to get most of her not-very-revolutionary ideas from mainstream women's magazines (2:05). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger)

'MY DEAH' ''The mind of a beauty queen is a thing to fear!'' John Epperson, a k a Lypsinka, brings his love of cultural deconstruction and reconstruction to this lovably trashy spoof of a certain exalted Greek tragedy, in which a scorned woman sets about chicken-frying her own children to get even with the no-account man who done her wrong. Nancy Opel and Maxwell Caulfield lead the cast in offering big servings of honey-baked ham (1:30). Abingdon Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)

'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)

'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called ''Post Mortem'' by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)

'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE' A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)

'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)

Spectacles

'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000, (Van Gelder)

Long-Running Shows

'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart and tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)

'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'THE BLUEST EYE' Toni Morrison's first novel is adapted by Lydia Diamond in a production aimed at young adults and teenagers. Sensitively acted, but it still feels like a book talking to us from the stage (1:30). Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'BUENOS AIRES IN TRANSLATION (BAiT)' Featuring four plays, this cross-cultural festival combines Argentinian writers and American directors, with mixed results. Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)

'EMERGENCE-SEE!' Daniel Beaty's solo show takes stock of the urban African-American mind in the new century, as dozens of men and women flock to Liberty Island when a slave ship mysteriously appears in New York Harbor. The performance captivates; the material doesn't (1:15). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'THE FLOOD' This eager, accomplished show about a devastating deluge in an Illinois town has a majestic score by Peter Mills and Cara Reichel and an able, ingratiating cast. Unfortunately, they're playing uninvolving, cookie-cutter characters (2:00). The American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Rob Kendt)

'LOVE, DEATH AND INTERIOR DECORATING' Theatergoers might want to arrive at intermission for this pair of one-acts by Keith Boynton. Though the first play is shallow and clumsy, the second, about a condemned revolutionary and his bourgeois lover, is fresh, literate and morally compelling (2:00). Altered Stages, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Miriam Horn)

'THE MAIL-ORDER BRIDE' and 'THE IMAGINARY INVALID' Charles L. Mee has taken Moliere's well-traveled hypochondriac, Argan, and given him a modern twist: the fellow thinks an Asian bride he has purchased will cure what ails him and give him back his youth. The Resonance Ensemble presents both the new work and the Moliere classic in repertory, but it's the Moliere (with an all-female cast) that works the best, thanks to Virginia Baeta's Argan. The actors in the Mee version never quite seem comfortable, which is too bad, because Mr. Mee packs the play with what should be good stuff. (Running time for each: 1:30.) The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger)

'PORT AUTHORITY THROW DOWN' Mike Batistick's intercultural tale of an angry Pakistani cabdriver, a white Christian missionary from Ohio, a black homeless alcoholic and the driver's activist brother is far from profound, but it has some solid laughs, and its battered heart is in the right place (2:00). Culture Project at 45 Below, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Gates)

'STANLEY 2006' Todd D'Amour's performance art piece rethinks Stanley Kowalski's feelings about Blanche DuBois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' The work is striking and original but at times frustrating and heavy on the angst (1:15). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Gates)

'THE SUNSET LIMITED' Cormac McCarthy's elegiac two-man play distills his previous work into a debate about suicide (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)

'THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN' ' The brilliant Twyla Tharp interprets the Bob Dylan songbook less than brilliantly. When a genius goes down in flames, everybody feels the burn (1:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)

'WRECKS' The tail wags the scorpion in the latest play by Neil LaBute to be propelled by a poisoned punch line. This slender, prickly tease of a monologue -- whose whole raison d'etre is its last-minute revelation -- is given substance by an expert performance by Ed Harris as a newly bereaved widower (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (A. O. Scott)

* 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN,' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Manohla Dargis) 'CAUTIVA' (No rating, 108 minutes, in Spanish) This sober melodrama explores the aftereffects of Argentina's dirty war, which have a devastating impact on a teenage girl who discovers terrible secrets in her past. (Scott)

'THE CAVE OF THE YELLOW DOG' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Mongolian) The dog is cute, the children are adorable, and the sky seems to stretch on without limit, as does, unfortunately, the slight story from the Mongolian-born filmmaker Byambasuren Davaa. (Dargis)

* 'CLIMATES' (No rating, 97 minutes, in Turkish) The story of a man and a woman, one of whom murders the other's love, and a haunting portrait of existential solitude. The Turkish writer and director Nuri Bilge Ceylan also stars. (Dargis)

'COME EARLY MORNING' (R, 97 minutes) Ashley Judd returns to the Southern, working-class milieu of her first screen triumph, ''Ruby in Paradise,'' to deliver her most natural screen performance since that film pushed her toward stardom in 1993. Aside from pungent local color, there's not much surrounding this portrait of an embittered barfly floundering through a succession of one-night stands. (Stephen Holden)

'COPYING BEETHOVEN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) The director Agnieszka Holland and her star Ed Harris bring intelligence and passion to a fictional account about the creation of the Ninth Symphony. Diane Kruger also stars. (Dargis)

'DANCE PARTY, USA' (No rating, 66 minutes) During a Fourth of July weekend in Portland, Oregon, a pair of disaffected 17-year-olds are nudged toward adulthood in a movie that favors natural drift over artificial drama. When Gus (Cole Pensinger) meets the more mature Jessica (Anna Kavan), his journey from crass ladykiller to sensitive boyfriend begins. Directed with extraordinary empathy by Aaron Katz (who also wrote the story), this admittedly slight movie is given heft by a plaintive tone and a camera fascinated by emotional shifts and shadows. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

* 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)

* 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)

'FUR: AN IMAGINARY PORTRAIT OF DIANE ARBUS' (R, 122 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as the famous photographer, and Robert Downey Jr. plays her imaginary furry friend. Steven Shainberg directs from a screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson. (Dargis)

'A GOOD YEAR' (PG-13, 117 minutes) This sun-dappled romantic diversion is a major departure for its director, Ridley Scott, and for its star, Russell Crowe. Mr. Crowe is miscast as a ferocious London bond trader who mellows after inheriting a French vineyard. It's a three-P movie, for pleasant, pretty and predictable. Add a fourth P, for piddling. (Holden)

'HARSH TIMES' (R, 119 minutes) Christian Bale turns in a spectacular technical performance as a war veteran running amok on the streets of South Central Los Angeles and dragging along his best friend (Freddy Rodriguez) on the road to hell. The losers in the directorial debut of David Ayer (who wrote ''Training Day'') are too repellent for you to waste time feeling sorry for. (Holden)

'THE MAGIC GLOVES' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Spanish) Depression, drugs and professional stasis commingle in this limp Argentine comedy whose characters remain trapped several rungs below their aspirations. In the foreground of a featureless Buenos Aires, paths cross and lock without import, and lives inch sideways (a cab driver becomes a bus driver), in reflection of the country's larger economic blight. Yet the fleeting moments of deadpan humor are pungent enough to suggest that the writer and director, Martin Rejtman, is saving himself for greater things. (Catsoulis)

* 'MARIE ANTOINETTE' (PG-13, 123 minutes) In this elaborate, bittersweet confection, Sofia Coppola imagines the last pre-revolutionary queen of France (played with wit and charm by Kirsten Dunst) as a bored, pleasure-seeking teenager trapped in a world of artifice and rigid protocol. Dreamy and decadent, the film is also touching, funny and bracingly modern. (Scott)

* 'THE PRESTIGE' (PG-13, 128 minutes) Entertaining, spirited and shamelessly gimmicky, Christopher Nolan's new film tells the intricate tale of two rival magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman) practicing their art in late-Victorian London. Scarlett Johansson is the lovely assistant. (Scott)

'THE SANTA CLAUSe 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE' (G, 98 minutes) Ho, ho, ho? No, no, no. (Dargis)

* 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed that the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)

'STRANGER THAN FICTION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Will Ferrell restrains his clownish impulses in this metaphysical comedy, directed with equal restraint by Marc Forster. Mr. Ferrell plays an I.R.S. agent who almost simultaneously falls in love with a baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and discovers that he is a character in an unfinished novel whose author (Emma Thompson) is planning to kill him. He seeks the help of a professor of literature played by Dustin Hoffman, who proves that scholarly criticism might not be a useless pursuit after all. (Scott)

'UMRAO JAAN' (No rating, 145 minutes, in Hindi and Urdu) Weak dubbing and melodramatic overkill hamper this retelling of a historical Indian story, about the travails of a performing courtesan. But its star, Aishwarya Rai, a potent presence, appears destined for international success. (Andy Webster)

* 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodovar, with Penelope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)

* 'THE WILD BLUE YONDER' (No rating, 81 minutes) An artful mixture of carefully culled and originally produced material, Werner Herzog's self-described ''science fiction fantasy'' purports to tell the story of an alien species beset by misfortune. Brad Dourif stars alongside some floating astronauts and a few exquisitely beautiful underwater drifters. (Dargis)

ROBERTO ROSSELLINI (Through Dec. 22) The Museum of Modern Art's retrospective of the work of Rossellini (1906-77), the grand old man of postwar Italy's neo-realist movement, continues. This weekend's films include ''Stromboli'' (1949), starring Ingrid Bergman as an Eastern European refugee in a bad marriage; ''The Messiah'' (1975), a biblical biography never released in the United States; and the classic ''Open City'' (1945), set in Rome during the final months of the German occupation.

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

* BARBARA COOK (Tomorrow) This lyric soprano's new show, ''No One Is Alone,'' with the pianist Eric Stern, celebrates the songs of Stephen Sondheim and his closest friends and collaborators, including Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Oscar Hammerstein, Richard Rodgers and Jules Styne. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $98. (Stephen Holden)

ANI DiFRANCO (Tomorrow) Ms. DiFranco's articulate, uninhibited songs and poems are about staying true to her complicated self: feisty and vulnerable, polysexual, uncompromising and politically engaged, but never humorless. She can strum a guitar and sling words at hyperspeed, or swerve toward jazz and funk. In business (she runs her own label, Righteous Babe Records), as in her music, she's as independent as they come. With Hamell on Trial. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; $47. (Jon Pareles)

* BOB DYLAN (Monday) On his 32nd studio album, ''Modern Times'' (Columbia), Mr. Dylan is obsessed with the mythic past, serving up a sleek, bluesy time warp that dips into Muddy Waters, Bing Crosby and the obscure 19th-century ''poet laureate of the Confederacy,'' Henry Timrod. Even when studying contemporary popular culture, he is reminded of his own back pages: ''I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying,'' he sings. ''When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line.'' At 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; sold out. (Ben Sisario)

BEN FOLDS (Tonight, Sunday and Monday) Though his most intriguing work since the demise of his band Ben Folds Five has been his direction two years ago on William Shatner's surprisingly strong album (really!) ''Has Been,'' in his solo work Mr. Folds has continued to skillfully and entertainingly walk a line between the snarky and the sincere. (His breathy piano-ballad version of a particularly vulgar Dr. Dre song crossed that line by miles.) Tonight at 8, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; sold out. Sunday at 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $37 in advance, $42 at the door. Monday at 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; $37 and $50. (Sisario)

GREY DOES MATTER (Tomorrow) Jason Crawford, the polymath who records as Grey Does Matter, used to take a reprogrammed Nintendo Gameboy along with him to help perform his spare, guitar-synthesizer songs of disconnection and boyish obsession. (''The wind gets in and burns the skin like a battleground super ninja.'') But now he has a full band and is celebrating the release of his new album, ''Your Job Will Kill You'' (Pop Rally!). At 8 p.m., Glasshouse Gallery, 289 Kent Avenue, at South First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com; $7. (Sisario)

HOLD STEADY, CONSTANTINES (Wednesday) Like a meeting of AC/DC and the E Street Band fronted by Shane MacGowan of the Pogues, the Hold Steady -- from Brooklyn, but with Minneapolis origins -- plays bare-knuckled guitar-rock, while its singer, Craig Finn, free-associates about religion and sex in a boozy snarl. ''I guess I've heard about original sin,'' he sings. ''I heard the dude blamed the chick.'' With the Constantines, a feedback-worshiping Canadian band. At 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $17. (Sisario)

JAGUARES (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Jaguares include former members of a leading Mexican rock band, Caifanes, and they add some alternative-rock touches to Caifanes's moody, dynamic songs. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $35 in advance, $38 at the door. (Pareles)

KID KOALA (Tonight) A superstar on the DJ circuit, Kid Koala, a k a Eric San, from Montreal, has the rare talent of imbuing scattered samples with humor and narrative, allowing him to capture the attention of audiences from clubs to stadiums. (He has opened for the Beastie Boys and Radiohead.) At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $15. (Sisario)

* MODEST MOUSE (Tonight and tomorrow night) A band so emblematic of 21st-century indie rock that it was mentioned by name in the Supreme Court's decision on MGM v. Grokster last year, Modest Mouse links antsy, catchy guitar lines to vocals that are always just a few shrieks away from a destructive tantrum. These shows complete a five-concert New York series showing off songs from the band's long-delayed new album as well as its newest member, Johnny Marr, the innovative guitarist of the Smiths. With Marcellus Hall. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)

MUDHONEY (Tonight and tomorrow night) When Mudhoney released its first record, ''Touch Me I'm Sick,'' in 1988, the band did not look built to last. But it has persisted with its mixture of sneering blues and boozy, decelerated punk, the ingredients that gave birth to grunge. With Birds of Avalon and Hank IV tonight, and Dan Melchior and Hulda tomorrow. At 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $18 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sisario)

NEW RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE (Tomorrow) There might not have been deafening cries for a reunion of the New Riders of the Purple Sage, the colorless country-rock spinoff of the Grateful Dead. But here it is, with an original member, David Nelson, and Buddy Cage, who took the place of Jerry Garcia on pedal steel guitar. At 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $35. (Sisario)

NEW YORK DOLLS (Wednesday) Never say die. With its two surviving original members well into their 50s, this proto-punk, proto-glam band, which made trashy cross-dressing a rock 'n' roll virtue, this summer released its first new album in 32 years, ''One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This'' (Roadrunner), and its appetite for sleazy vamps and hilarious wickedness is undiminished. ''You're designed so intelligent/ Ain't no way that was an accident,'' David Johansen sings in ''Dance Like a Monkey.'' ''Come on shake your monkey hips, my pretty little creationist.'' Presented by Little Steven's Underground Garage, with the Supersuckers, the Chesterfield Kings and the Charms. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25. (Sisario)

OK GO (Tomorrow) With all the focus on this Chicago band's dancing skills -- its ingenious treadmill skit was so popular online that MTV had the group perform it at the Video Music Awards this summer, despite the lack of a nomination -- not much attention has been paid to its jaunty, Cars-like and thoroughly adequate power-pop. So expect more dancing. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario)

* PERE UBU, BUSH TETRAS (Wednesday) Punk rock had an unassimilable avant-garde right from the start: in the mid-70s, while bands like the Dead Boys and the Ramones were perfecting the narrow sonic attack that came to be known as punk, Pere Ubu, from Cleveland, was playing a dissonant, urgent and deeply idiosyncratic variation centered on the sung-spoken vocals of David Thomas. The Bush Tetras, of early 80s New York vintage, have a squirmy funk take on experimental rock. At 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario)

PLIMSOULS (Tonight) One of the sharpest bands of the early 80s power-pop scene, the Plimsouls, from Los Angeles, reached back to the Beatles, as well as Elvis Costello, and cemented its place in pop culture with an appearance in the 1983 film ''Valley Girl.'' The band, led by Peter Case, has good luck with reunions: when it got back together in the mid-90s, it made one of its best albums, ''Kool Trash.'' At 8, with Parallax Project, Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, between Henry and Hicks Streets, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-0069, magneticbrooklyn.com; $15. (Sisario)

+44 (Tonight) It's not often that the rival former members of a multiplatinum band pass through town with their new groups, giving curious fans a controlled experiment to judge who has made out better. Last year the boys-will-be-boys pop-punk band Blink-182 went on acrimonious hiatus, and one of its two singers, Tom DeLonge, started a new group, Angels and Airwaves; it played the Bowery Ballroom in May. Now come the two other alumni, Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker, whose group, +44, plays Webster Hall tonight. Both bands are darker and more emo-influenced than Blink-182, but unfortunately for fans scrambling for a way into this show, neither has much of its fire. At 7, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario)

ROBERT RANDOLPH AND THE FAMILY BAND (Tonight) Robert Randolph used to play gospel songs on his pedal steel guitar at the House of God Church in Orange, N.J. But he and his band have emerged into the secular realm of jam bands, which have embraced both his rip-roaring virtuosity and his gift for making his instrument sing without a word. With Rocco DeLuca and the Burden. At 7:30, Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $30. (Pareles)

LAS RUBIAS DEL NORTE (Tomorrow) Las Rubias del Norte, long in residence at Barbes, a cozy bar in Park Slope, Brooklyn, play boleros, cumbias and other Latin styles, elegantly arranged for a small band and two songbird sopranos. 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $8. (Sisario)

GILBERTO SANTA ROSA (Wednesday) This salsa singer, or sonero, has held on to the fundamentals of the music, with a voice like a trumpet and a flair for improvisation. Salsa is getting squeezed on one side by reggaeton and on the other by sappy Latin pop, but Mr. Santa Rosa has persevered; at this concert, he celebrates 30 years of hits. At 8 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $65 to $125. (Pareles)

REGINA SPEKTOR (Monday) Rhapsodic and sweet, Ms. Spektor's fantasies veer from the childlike to the erotic, in endearingly idiosyncratic piano and vocal parts that can resemble P J Harvey, Billie Holiday or Chopin. At 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; sold out. (Sisario)

TRALALA, ANTIETAM (Tonight) The bohemian Brooklyn version of a girl group, Tralala (formerly Tight Fit) features four women singing in animated if inexact harmony, and three men bashing away at the kind of nursery-rhyme-Ramones groove perfected by Shonen Knife. Antietam's slashing guitars, shambling beat and defiant vocals defined indie rock before that label became a vague cliche. (Tralala also opens for Robyn Hitchcock tomorrow.) At 9, Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $7. (Sisario)

Steve Tyrell (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Tyrell belongs to a latter-day breed of rock singer who has belatedly embraced popular standards. The breed includes Rod Stewart (whose records Mr. Tyrell co-produces), Michael Bolton and Dr. John (for whom he sometimes sounds like vocal double). At 8:45 p.m., with additional shows tonight, tomorrow and Thursday night at 10:45, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $90 cover, dinner required. (Holden)

FRANKIE VALLI (Wednesday) Newly re-enshrined by ''Jersey Boys,'' a success on Broadway even as most other shows based on pop stars have failed -- does anyone remember ''Lennon''? -- Mr. Valli begins four nights of concerts at the Rose Theater, home of Jazz at Lincoln Center, joined as always by his Four Seasons. At 8 p.m., Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $75 to $125. (Sisario)

* DOC WATSON (Tomorrow) One of the great repositories of American folk music, the guitarist and singer Doc Watson, from Deep Gap, N.C., plays bluegrass, country and blues in an elegant but understated style. He performs as part of a tribute to the Friends of Old Time Music, an organization that played an important role in the early 1960s folk revival in New York City by putting on concerts by rural musicians (it first presented Mr. Watson in 1962); that group is also commemorated on an outstanding new boxed set, ''Friends of Old Time Music: The Folk Revival 1961-1965'' (Smithsonian Folkways). Also on the bill tomorrow are the New Lost City Ramblers, John Sebastian of the Lovin' Spoonful, and Jean Ritchie.

At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; sold out on Tuesday; $58.50 to $128.50 on Wednesday. (Sisario)

WOLFMOTHER (Wednesday) The retro-rock wayback machine makes two stops in the music of this Australian band: to the screamy abandon of mid-1960s garage rock, and then forward just a few years to the amp-throbbing, proto-metal bacchanals of Blue Cheer and Black Sabbath. With Dead Meadow and Silversun Pickups. At 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $27 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario)

If that sounds like the roll call for a combo, that's because it is, at least for a couple of hours. At 8, Flushing Town Hall, 137-35 Northern Boulevard, at Linden Place, Queens, (718) 463-7700, Ext. 222, flushingtownhall.org; $40; members, $28. (Chinen)

 Opera

* 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Monday) This breezy new production conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set -- a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality of the characters also comes through, thanks to subtle directing by Bartlett Sher. Peter Mattei is a robust and agile Figaro. Diana Damrau is a vocally brilliant and feisty Rosina. Juan Diego Florez could not be more adorable as Count Almaviva, though his voice sounds pinched and shaky at times. Maurizio Benini conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini)

'LA BOHEME' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) It's usually Mimi's show, but the tenors are a draw in this run: Rolando Villazon, the hot tenor of the moment, on the stage, and Placido Domingo in the role of mentor, that is, conductor, in the pit. Angela Marambio, the Chilean soprano who makes her company debut tomorrow, has already shown her credible Mimi across the plaza at the New York City Opera. Susannah Glanville and Peter Coleman-Wright are Musetta and Marcello; for some, Zeffirelli's production will always be the star. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $150 tickets remaining for tomorrow, $110 for Tuesday. (Anne Midgette)

'CARMEN' (Tomorrow) Seville is tired in Jonathan Eaton's ''Carmen'': battered Venetian blinds and jagged Corinthian columns create a mellow air of decrepitude without saying anything particularly original. It's a serviceable enough production, winding up its run tomorrow. Vanessa Cariddi plays the Gypsy; Kerri Marcinko and Daesan No are Micaela and Escamillo; Scott Piper, who has a promising voice he can sometimes use well, is Don Jose; and Gary Thor Wedow conducts. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; sold out. (Midgette)

'COSI FAN TUTTE' (Tonight) The City Opera's intelligently conceived and well-sung production of Mozart's masterpiece closes tonight. The cast is anchored by Julianna Di Giacomo and James Maddalena. Julius Rudel conducts. At 8, the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Bernard Holland)

'HANSEL AND GRETEL' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Opera is big and loud, ''children's theater'' is light and fun, and Engelbert Humperdinck's classic represents an uneasy juxtaposition of the two. City Opera deserves kudos for a production that, by setting the action in 1890's New York, moves the story into a more adult or believable realm -- with Hansel and Gretel as immigrant children lapsing into German ditties in a singing English translation -- without losing some of the important elements, like the witch going into the oven at the end. The singers trade off between performances; Jennifer Aylmer and Jennifer Rivera are one pair of leads who do a fine job. They sing tomorrow; Julianne Borg and Jennifer Tiller sing on Sunday. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Midgette)

* 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow) The Met inaugurated its season, and the tenure of the ambitious general manager Peter Gelb, with the Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella's visually beautiful production of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly.'' There is one more chance to see it. The abstract staging deftly employs movable screens, billowing fabrics, stylized costumes and, most daringly, a life-sized puppet manipulated by three black-clad puppeteers to portray Butterfly's 3-year-old son. Vocally, neither of the leads, the earthy-voiced soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domas as Butterfly, and the robustly Italianate tenor Marcello Giordani as Pinkerton, is ideal. But they do honorable work. James Levine conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini)

'TOSCA' (Tonight and Wednesday) Andrea Gruber is a soprano who flings herself into roles; accordingly, she takes on her first Tosca with a certain violence. The character becomes tough yet vulnerable in her reading, yet the vulnerability is perhaps too pronounced in her uneven, patchy singing. Vincenzo La Scola sings Cavaradossi tonight; Walter Fraccaro takes over on Wednesday. James Morris is a known and growly quantity as Scarpia. The real news is the company debut of Nicola Luisotti, who conducts the piece as if it mattered. Tonight at 8, Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $205 tickets remaining for tonight; $15 to $175 for Wednesday. (Midgette)

Classical Music

AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Leon Botstein and his orchestra continue their theme-based exploration of the repertory with ''Symphonic Mexico,'' a program that looks at three of Mexico's best-known composers. Silvestre Revueltas is represented by ''Redes'' (1943) and one of his most popular scores, ''La Noche de los Mayas'' (1939). From Carlos Chavez's catalog, Mr. Botstein leads the ''Sinfonia di Antigona'' (1933). And Anne-Akiko Myers will be the soloist in Manuel Ponce's Violin Concerto (1943). At 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, americansymphony.org; $27 to $55. (Allan Kozinn)

At 8, Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 967-9157, artekearlymusic.org; $25 and $35; $25 and $15 for students and 65+. (Kozinn)

BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) The business of this converted coffee barge is mostly chamber music, but tonight it offers something bigger: the Kremlin Chamber Orchestra, led by Misha Rachlevsky, in a program that includes Tchaikovsky, Vainberg, Galynin and Schnittke.

And Thursday is a night of piano trios (by Haydn and Schubert) and Ravel's Sonata for Violin and Cello. The players are Peter Winograd, a violinist; Wolfram Koessel, a cellist; and Steven Beck, a pianist.

(Kozinn)

* CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Tonight and Sunday) Late in life, when he was already ill, Debussy began composing a group of six sonatas for diverse instruments. But he died after writing only three of them. The Chamber Music Society has had the creative idea to invite three composers -- Steven Stucky, Kaija Saariaho and Marc-Andre Dalbavie -- to write three sonatas to take the places of Debussy's intended works. These recent pieces will be performed along with Debussy's sonatas, which were his final works. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5778, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $58. (Tommasini)

At 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28. (Schweitzer)

MANHATTAN SCHOOL OF MUSIC OPERA THEATER (Tonight and Sunday) Figaro reigns at the Manhattan School of Music, where students in the opera program are presenting scenes from his two best-known operas: Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro'' and Rossini's prequel, ''The Barber of Seville.'' Tonight at 8, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Broadway at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (917) 493-4428, www.msmnyc.edu; free. (Midgette)

RIAS KAMMERCHOR BERLIN (Tomorrow) This well-regarded group from Berlin sings a cappella music from Schubert to Wagner to Ligeti in the Metropolitan Museum's cavernous Temple of Dendur. At 8 p.m., (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $50. (Holland)

TRIO MEDIAEVAL (Sunday) This Norwegian ensemble of three women who produce a finely blended sound is devoted mostly to early music, as its name suggests, but also commissions new works. For its current United States tour, which ends with this concert in the Music Before 1800 series, the singers are including Norwegian folk ballads within their program of medieval works. At 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266, mb1800.org; $25 to $40; $5 off for students and 62+. (Kozinn)

Art

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

 Museums

* Bronx Museum of the Arts, 'Tropicalia: A Revolution in Brazilian Culture,' through Jan. 28. Tropicalia, or Tropicalism, wasn't a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over Brazil in the late 1960s like a sun shower, and soaked into everything -- art, music, film, theater and architecture -- until a military government clamped down. This show is an attempt to recapture the moment's fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and musicians like Gilberto Gil, it comes close. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)

Brooklyn Museum: 'ANNIE LEIBOVITZ: A PHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE, 1990-2005,' through Jan. 21. With photographs of her close-knit family and her companion, Susan Sontag; bits of photojournalism; and a pretentious foray into landscape photography, this large exhibition tells you more about Ms. Leibovitz than you probably want to know. The first-person text labels don't help. Not surprisingly, her well-known celebrity portraits are strongest, and at their best in a re-creation of the large pin-up boards on which she plotted the lavish book that accompanies the show. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Roberta Smith)

BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'RON MUECK,' through Feb. 4. So intensely lifelike are the fiberglass and silicone human figures made by the Australian sculptor Ron Mueck that you might almost converse with them. Ranging in size from an infant that is 10 and a quarter inches high to a woman in bed more than 21 feet long, they seem to embody, in one way or another, the perils and challenges of the human condition. The most affecting are ''Dead Dad,'' a 40-inch rendering of the artist's father as a nude corpse, and ''Man in a Boat,'' in which a man a little more than two feet high sits naked and hapless toward the prow of a life-size rowboat. But Mr. Mueck stumbles when he gets into really exaggerated scale in several pieces, like the tableau of the woman in bed, giant hand to apprehensive face. The subject has not earned its monumentality, and its size distracts from its emotional intensity. Still, there are moments when you almost believe his subjects have lives. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

* Frick Collection: 'Domenico Tiepolo (1727-1804): A New Testament,' through Jan. 7. The 60 ink drawings by Domenico Tiepolo, son of the Italian master painter Giambattist, have a funny kind of jitter. They look as if they were maybe woven from hair-fine brambles, or done on a ride over rough ground, or in a state of agitated elation. Illustrations of episodes from the four Gospels, they are among some 300 drawings the artist did in a project that seems to have been an extended exercise in personal piety. In them the Christian story of salvation becomes an operatic epic, gravely serious, but with notes of homely sweetness: Jesus in Gethsemane delivers his aria of mortal doubt and pain high up on a bare stage, all alone; the Virgin Mary's mother, Anna, aged and stooped, is cosseted by angel-nurses, who guide her every step. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)

* Frick Collection: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART,' through Jan. 28. This exhibition transcends the usual traveling masterpieces-from genre, with room to spare. The 14 paintings include almost always outstanding works by household names like Velazquez, Caravaggio, El Greco, Turner and Poussin, as well as Annibale Carracci, Francisco de Zurbaran and Andrea del Sarto. But the astute installation makes the most of all this star power, letting the works talk among themselves to a remarkable degree, illuminating their likenesses, differences and collective progress. Extending John Berger's famous title, the show might be called ''Ways of Seeing Paintings.'' (See above.) (Smith)

* SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LUCIO FONTANA: VENICE/NEW YORK,' through Jan. 21. If the Italian artist Lucio Fontana (1899-1968) was dazzled by Venice, he was positively awestruck by New York, which he first visited in 1961. For each city he created a group of works that he felt expressed its individual spirit. For Venice, a group of richly sensual oil paintings, with his signature slashes and punctures, evoked his personal experience of the lagoon city in glowing colors during the passage of a day. For New York he chose shiny metal surfaces, slashed and pierced to give a semblance of the wired energy and architectural vivacity he saw as the essence of the futuristic metropolis. The two groups are united for the first time, and well attended by works and photographs of works that trace from 1949 the career of an artist seeking to transcend the boundaries of his era. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Glueck)

Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Americans in Paris: 1860-1900,' through Jan. 28. The Americanization of the world may be a done deal now, but not so long ago the United States was a buyer rather than a seller of cultural information, and France was a major source between the Civil War and World War I. That's the story told in this exhibition. The basic ideas, though undeveloped, are inherently interesting, and the art, with some notable exceptions, is conservative and staid, especially when compared with work in the Met's Vollard show, done at the same time. (212) 535-7719, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)

The Met: 'Coaxing the Spirits to Dance,' through Sept. 3, 2007. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Glueck)

MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'FRAGONARD AND THE FRENCH TRADITION' AND 'MOZART AT 250: A CELEBRATION,' through Jan. 7. Memorializing Mozart's 250th birthday and the 200th anniversary of the death of the French painter Jean-Honore Fragonard, these small, paired shows reflect the elegance and brio of 18th-century culture. The Fragonard display consists only of his drawings and those of some compatriots, among them Francois Boucher, Hubert Robert and Jean-Baptiste Greuze; 40 works in all, drawn almost entirely from the Morgan's collection. The show effectively displays the virtuosity and variety of Fragonard's many styles, from his skills at depicting foliage-filled landscapes and the play of water in fountains and streams, to his keenness at capturing people, mythological scenes and ephemeral creatures. Although the works in the Mozart display -- letters and musical scores -- are in quite a different visual language, they go very happily with the Fragonard group. And you can hear excerpts from the manuscripts at two different listening stations in the show. 255 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Glueck)

* Museum of Modern Art: 'Manet and the Execution of Maximilian,' through Jan. 29. This small, gripping, focused show remind us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here: eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded here by a selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying, a new kind of history painting, that turned an art of pre-set ideals into one of mutable and unpredictable realities. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)

* Moma: 'BRICE MARDEN: A RETROSPECTIVE OF PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS,' through Jan. 15. This quietly magnificent 40-year retrospective pays tribute to an artist who helped rebuild painting in the 1970s, working back from the brink of single-panel monochromes to elegant tangles of thick line on vibrant monochrome grounds that encompass a tremendous emotional range and sense of physical energy, and give the lie to the idea that any art can be purely formal or completely abstract. Mr. Marden converted the rule-ridden zone of Minimalist abstraction into a capacious yet disciplined place, pushing it toward landscape, the figure and its roots in Abstract Expressionism and beyond, in non-Western art. And he may have saved the best for last. (See above.) (Smith)

* UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'CROSSROADS: MODERNISM IN UKRAINE, 1910-1930,' through March 11. Some of the great names in Modernist Russian art -- Malevich, El Lissitsky, Rodchenko, Archipenko and Exter -- were actually born, or identified themselves as, Ukrainian. And this show of more than 70 works by 21 artists , including many interesting lesser-knowns, informs us that their Ukrainian-ness made an impact on their contributions to the Modernist movements of the 20th century. Discoveries in the show include Vsevolod Maksymovych, a painter drawing on Symbolist sources, heavily influenced by classical themes and the campy erotica of the British graphic artist Aubrey Beardsley; and Anatol Petrytsky, a painter and creator of lighthearted, collagelike sketches for classical and avant-garde opera and ballet. Stressing as it does the importance of Ukrainian participation in Modernist art, the show is equally significant in its exposure to Americans of lively talents, largely unknown. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 228-0110, ukrainianmuseum.org. (Glueck)

* The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY: FROM THE BAUHAUS TO THE NEW WORLD,' through Jan. 21. This vigorously multimedia show traces the trajectories of two Modernist pioneers who overlapped as teachers at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and went on, separately, to influence postwar art and design in the United States. Ranging through painting, sculpture, film, design, prints and commercial art, it clarifies the Bauhaus debt to Russian Constructivism and includes works that presage the ''specific objects'' of the 1960s. Given the peregrinations of young artists among multiple art media, the show could not be more pertinent. The less-known Moholy-Nagy looks especially adventuresome. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)

Galleries: Chelsea

ERNESTO NETO: 'FROM WHAT WE ARE MADE' Mr. Neto presents his version of the miracle of human conception with a luminous white tent the shape of a rainbow, with a thick foam floor, filled with a pile of small, colorful soft sculptures made in pantyhose fabric and stuffed with buckwheat shells. As the viewer enters the enclosed space, the floor shifts and subsides, tossing the sculptures about the tent and making it hard to stay upright. It is like traversing a marshmallow or wading through a pool of jelly, though with the phantasmagoria of a funhouse in which we can climb and play. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com, through Nov. 25th. (Benjamin Genocchio)

* JENNIFER BORNSTEIN You are an anthropologist studying your own tribe without benefit of camera. What to do? Try etching. In her first New York exhibition since her 1998 debut, the neo-Conceptualist Jennifer Bornstein does exactly this, creating small, meticulous, slightly naive etched portraits of her subjects, starting with her teenage roommate. Friends, colleagues and students are tenderly rendered, as are female performance artists from the 1970s; ideas for sculptures and installations, and, finally, Margaret Mead. The meditation on things anthropological turns in a sly yet genuine self-portrait. Gavin Brown's enterprise, 620 Greenwich Street, at Leroy Street, South Village, (212) 627-5258; closes tomorrow.

* FERNANDO BOTERO: ABU GHRAIB It is moving to encounter these large, unnerving images and austere compositions on American soil. Based on images and written accounts that came to light at the time of the Iraq prison abuse scandal, they do something the harrowing photographs of the naked, blindfolded and tormented prisoners do not: they restore their dignity and humanity without diminishing their agony or the absolute injustice of their situation. Mr. Botero manages this as painters always have, through manipulations of scale, color and form and majestic isolation and by making surprisingly astute readjustments of his own daffy style. Marlborough Gallery, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

Anant Joshi Cities in Asia are changing fast. They're going up and coming down at about equal speed. Urban culture, flooded with global goods and media, is changing too. Inevitably, such transformations have a big impact on art, and they are the subjects of new work by Anant Joshi, who lives and works in Mumbai. Paintings show a vision of the city modeled on commercial packing materials. Small sculptures, monuments to consumerist chaos, are assembled from hundreds of miniature toys, all made in China. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 673-3096, talwargallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)

Lisa Yuskavage Featuring nearly 30 pieces, two shows star the dreamily rendered, improbably cantilevered women with whom Ms. Yuskavage has made her reputation. At first glance, these new works seem as dominated as ever by their subjects' cartoonish physical attributes: wistful, pneumatic nudes set in sumptuous, jewel-toned environments, their louche fecundity echoed in sexualized scatterings of globular fruit and bursting floral arrangements. Yet these paintings hold clues to the evolution of Ms. Yuskavage's program. Her transgressive tightrope act between feeding and interrogating the male gaze is more rewarding because she has endowed her characters not simply with dramatic curves, but also with an increasingly vivid inner life. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea, and Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street; closes tomorrow. (Jeffrey Kastner)

HEADLINE: As Oil and Gas Prices Fall, the Dow Hits Another Peak

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street scored a fifth straight gain and the Dow Jones industrials achieved their third straight record close yesterday after the Labor Department said falling gas prices helped push inflation down last month.
 Oil prices that plunged to their lowest level in a year added to the advance.
 The inflation report, and the prospect of a further decline as oil prices drop, bolstered the notion that the economy could slow enough to allow the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates eventually. 
 Though stocks moved higher over all, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by only six to five in the New York Stock Exchange, suggesting some investors are concerned the market could be overbought.
 Nonetheless, investors took their cues from the inflation news and indications that a flurry of private equity buyouts would continue, with deals announced for Clear Channel Communications and the Reader's Digest Association.
 The Dow rose 54.11 points, or 0.44 percent, to 12,305.82. The Dow again set a new trading high of 12,325.91, passing 12,300 for the first time.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.19 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,399.76, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 6.31 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,449.06. The S.&P. is at a six-year high, while the Nasdaq is near a six-year high.
 Financial stocks and the consumer discretionary sectors led the advancers, while energy stocks moved lower as commodity prices fell. Light crude oil settled down $2.50 at $56.26 on the New York Mercantile Exchange as traders focused on the drop in demand that a slowing economy could bring rather than any production cuts, which could support prices.
 Bonds fell sharply, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rising to 4.66 percent from 4.62 percent on Wednesday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 12/32, to 99 22/32. 
 The 0.5 percent drop in the Consumer Price Index, the crucial measure of inflation, matched the decline in September and was the first two-month drop since late last year. The core inflation figure, which strips out volatility-prone prices for food and energy, rose 0.1 percent, the smallest increase in eight months.
 The Labor Department also reported the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell by 2,000, to 308,000, last week, the lowest reading in a month. Last month, the nation's unemployment rate fell to a five-year low.
 Stocks gained after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that its index of manufacturing conditions rose to 5.1 from negative 0.7 in October. A positive reading signifies growth. Regional economic conditions ''improved slightly'' in November, but indicators for new orders and employment weakened.
 Clear Channel, the country's No. 1 owner of radio stations, agreed to be taken private for about $18.7 billion by an investment group led by Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital Partners. The deal includes about $8 billion in debt. Clear Channel rose $1.24, or 3.6 percent, to $35.36.
 Reader's Digest, the magazine publisher and direct marketer, rose $1.19, or 7.6 percent, to $16.70 after agreeing to be acquired for about $1.61 billion by an investment consortium led by a private equity group, Ripplewood Holdings.
 Dell, the computer maker, fell 65 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $25.10. Dell delayed its third-quarter earnings report and announced that federal regulators had begun a formal investigation into the company. Dell said it did not know the specific nature of the investigation.
 Also, dragging on the Nasdaq, Applied Materials, the maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, fell 67 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $17.98 after it reported weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter revenue and earnings.
 KBR, a unit of the Halliburton Company, opened for trading after its initial public offering and jumped $3.75, or 22.1 percent, to $20.75. The car rental company Hertz Global, which also made its debut, was up 72 cents, or 4.8 percent, at $15.72.
 Consolidated volume at the New York Stock Exchange came to 2.83 billion shares compared with 2.93 billion traded Wednesday.

HEADLINE: With Markets Doubting OPEC Cut, Oil Is Lowest in a Year

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Oil prices fell to their lowest level in a year yesterday as oil traders expressed doubt that OPEC members would carry out on their recent deal to trim production. 
 In New York trading, crude oil for December delivery lost 4.25 percent, or $2.50 a barrel, to settle at $56.26. The drop, the steepest in 15 months, came as oil and natural gas inventories increased as a result of milder weather in the United States and Europe, reducing demand.
Three weeks ago, at a hastily convened meeting in Doha, Qatar, OPEC representatives pledged to cut their output by 4 percent to stem a precipitous slide in prices. The special meeting of the oil producers' cartel put a temporary brake on what had been a 25 percent price drop since July. But many oil traders and hedge fund managers are skeptical about OPEC's willingness to pare production as long as prices remain high. 
 The uncertainty surrounding OPEC policies underscores the cartel's difficulties in coping with a slowing market after three years of rising prices and surging demand. Analysts view the group as too divided to be effective: at best, they expect OPEC members to fulfill only half the cuts pledged in Qatar.
 The price drop yesterday was precipitated by contradictory reports on OPEC's export levels. Oil Movement, a consulting firm that tracks oil tanker movements, said OPEC shipments would rise for the four weeks to Dec. 2; another consultant, PetroLogistics, said it expected OPEC shipments to fall this month. While so-called tanker trackers' estimates can be misleading, the conflicting views allowed oil traders to discount OPEC's policies and focus more on the effect of mild weather in the United States and Europe.
 ''I've been trading 20 years,'' said Eric Bolling, an independent trader on the New York Mercantile Exchange, ''and my thesis has been not to listen to what OPEC says, but look at what they do. As long as prices remain relatively high, OPEC will continue to put crude out there. When prices fall lower, they will cut production.''
 Weeks from the beginning of winter, a peak demand season for oil worldwide, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries once more finds itself in a quandary: should it keep supplies tight to stop prices from falling much below $60 a barrel or should it ease its grip, risking the addition of fresh supplies to already bulging oil inventories.
 ''The return to discipline is going to be tough for OPEC,'' said Frederic Lasserre, head of commodity research at Societe Generale in Paris. ''OPEC has not convinced the oil market.''
 Earlier this week, confusion over OPEC's actions prompted Saudi Arabia, the main power broker in the oil cartel, to repeat its intention of reducing its own production this year. The Saudis had already signaled that more cuts might be needed before the end of the year if prices fell further. OPEC is to meet again next month in Nigeria.
 Saudi Arabia, which pumped 9.1 million barrels a day in October, would have to pare its output to 8.7 million barrels, the lowest level in three years, to abide by its pledge. Because of the lack of reliable data on oil production, it will be weeks, if not months, before anyone knows for sure how much Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members are actually pumping today.
 ''Many OPEC countries believe the market is indeed very soft, so we might cut production,'' Edmund Daukoru, the Nigerian oil minister and OPEC's current president, told Reuters on Wednesday. ''I have the feeling that the general sentiment is for another cut.''
 To be sure, OPEC, which accounts for 40 percent of the world's exports, retains considerable market power. In the past, bets against OPEC have proved costly and such strategies could backfire again. 
 Hedge fund managers and big speculators seem to have scaled back their bets on falling oil prices for the first time in four weeks. But short positions -- where the trader is betting on a drop in prices -- still outnumber long positions, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission reported this week.
 Some analysts said OPEC was determined to keep markets from slipping out of its control.
 ''There is a lot of doubt on the market, but I do not think it is justified,'' said Roger Diwan, a managing director at PFC Energy, a consulting firm in Washington. ''Some people think all you have to do is press a button and a production cut is immediate. But it's a big deal; you have to rearrange loading schedules, inform customers -- it all takes time.'' 
 ''The Saudis are serious about this,'' he added, ''and they all have an interest to cooperate.''
 In Qatar, OPEC surprised the market by pledging to reduce output by 1.2 million barrels a day starting Nov. 1, slightly more than the figure of a million barrels that had been widely circulated in the weeks leading to the meeting.
 The group is worried about the high level of commercial oil supplies in Western countries that have been steadily building in recent months, and it is seeking to force down the inventory levels. OPEC strategists want to avoid a repetition of 1997, when high inventories and a heavily supplied market, coupled with a sudden drop in demand from the Asian financial crisis, led to a collapse in oil prices. 
 Among the Saudi objectives, according to Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York, is ''to stem the blood bath in the market.''
 Data from the West's energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, shows that oil inventories in countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development covered 55 days of demand at the end of September, two days more than the period a year earlier. 
 Some analysts pointed out that inventories in the United States have been falling sharply in recent days.
 Paul Horsnell of Barclays Capital said in a note this week, ''We believe the market is ultimately going to face overtightening and the longer it takes before prices make a more significant move up, the more vicious is likely to be the whiplash when they do start to move.''

HEADLINE: Study Charts Broad Manipulation of Options

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Abuses of stock option grants are perceived to have spread like a virus among high-technology companies. But a new study suggests that hundreds of old-economy companies may also have caught the backdating bug.
 In a paper to be released today, researchers estimate that 590 nontechnology companies appear to have manipulated options so their chief executives received them at the lowest price of the month. That compares with 130 technology companies that appear to have backdated their chief executives' options to a monthly low during a 10-year period to the end of 2005.
Traditional manufacturing and service firms make up the bulk of publicly traded companies, so it comes as no surprise that the sheer number of manipulated grants outside the technology sector is larger. 
 Yet old-economy companies also appear to have made improper grants somewhat less frequently than their new-economy peers, making patterns more difficult to find. That combination, the researchers suggest, has allowed old-line companies to escape much of the scrutiny.
 The study is the latest in a series of papers by academic and governance research groups that attempt to measure the extent of the backdating scandal and to explain how it spread. More than 120 companies are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service are conducting separate reviews. More than 50 executives and directors have been forced out or fired as a result.
 Even as companies like UnitedHealth Group and KB Home have reported options-related problems and ousted their top executives, many observers still consider backdating a hangover from the dot-com boom.
 Most companies that have come forward so far appear to be concentrated around Silicon Valley and other technology hot spots. They include a large number of software and semiconductor companies, with a big portion of their executives' total pay apparently coming from equity grants. 
 But the study suggests that the problem was more widespread. 
 Of the roughly 1,150 options grants that the researchers believe were manipulated, an estimated 950, or 80 percent, were at nontechnology companies.
 ''It is not the case that people should concentrate on new-economy firms,'' said Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard Law School professor and director of its corporate governance program. ''That is the impression that one might get from the cases that have come under scrutiny thus far.'' 
 Professor Bebchuk co-wrote the study with Yaniv Grinstein, a Cornell University professor, and Urs Peyer of the French business school Insead. It is to be posted today on the Web site of the Harvard Law School corporate governance program.
 The study also questions the notion that companies backdated stock options as a tax-efficient method of compensation. Backdated gains, in this view, were simply a substitute for offering executives more cash.
 The analysis found that this was not the case. ''C.E.O.'s who got lucky grants also received higher levels of other forms of compensation relative to peer companies,'' Professor Bebchuk said.
 The researchers said the study underscored the importance of having independent directors to counter the influence of the chief executive. A company that had a majority of independent directors on its board reduced the chances that it engaged in manipulation by more than a third, according to a statistical analysis in the report.
 In their study, the researchers examined some 19,000 options grants at about 5,800 companies from 1996 to the end of 2005. They found evidence suggesting that nearly 12 percent, or about 720, of the companies appear to have made at least one options grant that occurred at the lowest price of the month because of manipulation. That number may expand by several hundred companies if the second- and third-lowest prices of the month are included.
 Still, the new figure is significantly smaller than the estimate that more than 2,000 companies, or 29.2 percent of companies in the study, engaged in backdating to sweeten their executives' pay. That finding, based on a similar data analysis, was released this summer by Randall Herron, an Indiana University finance professor, and Erik Lie, a University of Iowa finance professor whose research is widely credited with provoking the inquiries into options grants. 
 The study by Professors Herron and Lie found that the abuse was more prevalent in high-technology firms, where an estimated 32 percent of unscheduled grants were backdated; at other firms, an estimated 20 percent were backdated.
 Professor Bebchuk's group found a much lower level of manipulation and a narrower difference between old- and new-economy companies. In his study, the percentage of all grants that were in the month's lowest price because of manipulation was 5.7 percent for nontechnology firms, compared with 6.1 percent for the entire sample.
 The discrepancy between the two studies probably results from their different starting points and approaches. Professors Herron and Lie searched for differences in backdating patterns between new- and old-economy companies by observing abnormal returns before and after an options grant date for corporate insiders. Professor Bebchuk's team focused on the grants awarded to chief executives at monthly lows, which were most likely to be manipulated, and then on the differences between technology companies and nontechnology companies.

HEADLINE: A Charismatic Economist Who Loved to Argue

BYLINE: By AUSTAN GOOLSBEE. 
Austan Goolsbee is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. E-mail: goolsbee@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
Someone walked into our lunchroom yesterday at the University of Chicago and announced that Milton Friedman had died. Mr. Friedman spent his intellectual life here, so I started asking people here about him and what they remembered. It became clear that despite retiring almost 30 years ago (and despite being only 5-foot-3), he still casts a long shadow.
 To much of the world, he is known for his free market, antigovernment message and his influence on conservative leaders. But in an interview, Mr. Friedman once said that while his efforts to influence public policy had received more public attention, they had been more of an avocation. ''My real vocation,'' he said, ''has been scientific economics.'' 
What struck me as I talked with my colleagues yesterday was how Mr. Friedman's legacy among economists is in some ways similar but in some ways quite different from the public view. His manner of research, his personality, even the topics he studied spawned a great deal of the economics we know today -- even among economists whose politics differ greatly from his. A striking number of topics he worked on, for example, ultimately developed into other people's Nobel awards.
 One of Mr. Friedman's major impacts on economics was in establishing a basic worldview. Economics is not a game or an academic exercise, in that view. Economics is a powerful tool to understand how the world works. He used straightforward theory. He gathered data from anywhere he could get it. He wanted to see how well economics fitted the world. That view now holds sway throughout much of the profession.
 Mr. Friedman loved to argue. They say he was the greatest debater in all of economics. As improbable as it sounds, given Mr. Friedman's small frame and thick glasses, few who saw him would deny that he had an astounding amount of charisma. It probably explains why he was so successful on television. While being an academic powerhouse, he really could explain things clearly.
 Mr. Friedman brought his brashness and his love of debate to the University of Chicago and commenced the golden age for the most heralded center of economics. In his autobiographical statement for the Nobel in economic science, which he received in 1976, Mr. Friedman said that when he arrived in the 1930s, he encountered a ''vibrant intellectual atmosphere of a kind that I had never dreamed existed.''
 ''I have never recovered.''
 And we never recovered, either. Chicago remains a place with an intensity without precedent in the world of economics, where we seem to eat, drink and breathe economics, and Mr. Friedman's personality has much to do with that. He always wanted to engage in a debate on something (or, according to his detractors, to make a pronouncement about something). Nowadays, much of the political edge to the research is gone -- there are Democrats and Republicans on the faculty -- but the intensity remains.
 The funny thing about Mr. Friedman's transition to iconic status is that it happened without his ever losing his bluntness. He wasn't, necessarily, polite. Even at 93, he was out declaring that fixed exchange rates are price controls and so the euro is doomed. He really didn't care if you liked what he said. That was true within economics just as much as it was in the policy arena.
 Mr. Friedman was proof that a great economist could become famous for just talking about economics. But he wasn't afraid to poke his nose in places where people said economists had no business being. He passed that attitude on to students like Gary S. Becker, who would win the Nobel in 1992, and in the wider profession, especially among a younger set of economists like Steven D. Levitt of ''Freakonomics'' fame.
 Mr. Friedman's legacy might mean laissez-faire politics to the outside world, but to economists -- and especially Chicago economists -- it is more about trying to understand how the world works and engaging in a debate about it.
 When we heard the news at the University of Chicago that he had died, we actually stopped arguing and were quiet for a moment. It was a most extraordinary event for Chicago economists. Each of us seemed to contemplate Mr. Friedman's legacy for ourselves. After that bit of calm, the argument resumed. It was, perhaps, just what the old man would have wanted.

HEADLINE: The Complex Legacy Of an Enslaved Past

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
When the New-York Historical Society opened an extensive exploration of slavery in New York last year with an ambitious exhibition, it began to transform how New York remembers itself. The city, of course, always had its riots, its social traumas, its eruptions of unrest, but wasn't New York (at least in our cosmopolitan imaginations) immune from systematic associations with history's more deplorable practices? If not always a model of tolerance, didn't its growth as a port, its importance as a center of international commerce and its churning population of immigrants and aspirants lead to an enduring liberality of spirit?
 Perhaps, but that first exhibition, ''Slavery in New York,'' surveyed the impact of slavery from the colonial period until its abolition in 1827. It demonstrated that the enslavement of Africans was not alien to New York's past but an essential part of it; slavery was indelibly linked to the labor that built New York and the trade that nourished it. 
The society's second major exploration of this subject, ''New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War,'' which opens today, is even more potent than the first, a fitting conclusion to a multiyear project guided by Louise Mirrer, the society's president. This exhibition is smaller and more focused, dealing with the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction. It is less concerned with pulling in children with minor entertainments (though it includes an opportunity to print out and personalize an abolitionist newspaper and features one display in which viewers ''vote'' electronically on issues debated in a video enactment of an 1835 black convention). And while its predecessor, in breaking new ground, tended to overstate its case, this show is fully intent on portraying the complexities and contradictions that shaped a great city. 
 The historian Richard Rabinowitz, the show's curator, joined by James Oliver Horton, the exhibition's chief historian, and a panel of consulting historians have mounted exhibits ranging from 19th-century invoices and documents to a video reconstructing part of a minstrel show; from soft-hued romantic views of the South in Currier & Ives prints to political cartoons of the 1850s; from images of the Colored Orphan Asylum that was burned down in the 1863 draft riots to a wooden draft lottery wheel used in Lower Manhattan before those five days of destruction, including assaults on black residents that constituted some of the worst violence in New York's history. 
 New York, the exhibition reveals, might have had a ''determined antislavery movement,'' but it was also a ''hotbed of pro-slavery politics.'' Its growing publishing industry might have helped produce abolitionist pamphlets, like ''The Child's Anti-Slavery Book'' (which is on display), but most of its newspapers held views like The New-York Herald's in 1835: ''We believe that the institution of slavery in the South is no evil -- that it is a positive good.'' (A screen shows images of such newspapers with their opinions boldly highlighted.) 
 In almost every presidential election from 1832 to 1868, the exhibition tells us, New York supported the Democratic candidate rather than an opponent less supportive of slavery. Abraham Lincoln, though carrying New York State in 1860, won only 35 percent of the New York City vote. 
 One explanation for such conflicting advocacy is shown at the entrance to the show: bales of raw cotton hanging from the ceiling. Picked by slave labor, Southern cotton eventually made up 60 percent of the nation's exports and provided seven-eighths of the world's supply. Much of it passed through New York. In 1822 half of New York's exports consisted of cotton shipments, and New York trade accounted for 38 cents of every dollar earned on cotton. 
 To some extent the exhibition goes too far here, seeming to imply that mercantile prosperity was necessarily tainted by slavery, as in the case of Jeremiah Thompson, a Yorkshire-born merchant in woolen goods, whose packet shipping company, the wall text says, helped make New York such a ''fulcrum of transatlantic cotton and sugar trading.'' But not all commerce of the period should be drawn into the same web, and economic interests do not always determine opinion: Mr. Thompson, for example, was a Quaker and a member of the New York Manumission Society, which worked to emancipate black New Yorkers. 
 But the commercial lure of the South must have still been phenomenal. One gallery stresses the way New York hotels offered Southern-style hospitality to Southern guests, and it quotes a lawyer of the period referring to New York as ''virtually an annex of the South.'' What accompanied all this, the exhibition then shows, is racial caricaturing in popular culture: in P. T. Barnum exhibits, minstrel shows and dance clubs. 
 The second half of the exhibition, in which the city deals with the consequences of these associations, is unusually powerful and extensive, so much so, it can seem too compressed for its subject. The literature of abolition is on display, accounts of the politics of the 1850s are outlined in knotty cartoons, and evidence mounts that the national issue of slavery has become a touchstone in New York politics. 
 One gallery pays tribute to the egalitarian ideas of James McCune Smith -- ''the most remarkable black New Yorker of the 19th century'' -- whose words are eloquently brought to life in videos featuring Danny Glover. Mr. Smith, who was educated in Glasgow, was the first black doctor and the first black political candidate in New York State, a graceful polemicist and a lyrical writer: ''What stone has been left unturned to degrade us? What hand has refused to fan the flame of popular prejudice against us? What American artist has not caricatured us? What wit has not laughed at us in our wretchedness?'' he writes. ''Few, few, very few.''
 The cataclysm of the Civil War approaches, but it leads to no clear resolution. In 1861 the city's mayor, Fernando Wood -- about as far from an abolitionist as a New Yorker could be -- suggested that New York City should declare independence from both the North and the South, and serve both. The city's real allegiance might seem evident: New York was becoming a center of the Union economic and military effort; ships were built at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, uniforms were supplied by the nascent garment industry, bankers were assuming large amounts of Union debt, and New York lost more soldiers in the Civil War (46,434) than any other state. But there were also countervailing forces. A featured speaker at the postwar 1868 Democratic National Convention, held in New York, was Nathan Bedford Forrest, a founder of the Ku Klux Klan. 
 You move through the exhibition's documents and objects (including a Union jacket made by Brooks Brothers, a store looted during the draft riots) and try to come to clarity, but contradictions persist. On the one hand, in 1864 a black woman whose soldier husband was killed in the war was asked to leave a railway car in the city to sit in spaces approved for colored riders; on the other hand, she sued the railroad company and won. On one hand, city officials refused to allow blacks to march in Lincoln's funeral procession; on the other hand, the secretary of war intervened in their favor, though they were permitted only to bring up the long, trailing rear. 
 The exhibit ends in a period in which the ideals of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, which sought to undo slavery's social evils, work their halting and stuttering effect (with New York State actually rescinding the ratification of the 15th); meanwhile large-scale immigration and the birth of modern urban life transform other elements in the racial equation. There is no sense of triumph here: one knows how much is yet to come. 
 But it is also clear just how immense and remarkable this long conflict against slavery and its heritage has been: a singular enterprise, quashing an ancient evil in its singularly modern form. To feel the weight of such forces and begin to sense the complications that gave them shape in a city like New York, is to begin to feel the pulse of history itself, which is precisely what a historical society might well set as its goal and which is, here, handsomely achieved. 

''New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War,'' runs through Sept. 3 at the New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, Manhattan, (212) 873-3400. Open Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. $10; 65+, $7; students, $6; members and under 12, free. Beginning tonight and running through the length of the exhibition, the society will remain open Friday nights from 6 to 8 p.m., with free admission.
