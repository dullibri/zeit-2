HEADLINE: Salvaging Public Housing

 BODY:
Public housing started in New York as a transitional stop for poor families on the way up. But Federal rules that discriminate against working tenants have turned once-glistening housing projects in many cities into gang-controlled dumping grounds for the poorest of the poor and the long-term unemployed. In New York, advocates for the homeless have long opposed a plan for preserving public housing's stability by setting aside at least some apartments for people who work. But now that both the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and a Federal court have approved the plan, Ruben Franco, chairman of the New York City Housing Authority, is free to proceed with what is essentially a common-sense arrangement.
Public housing in New York City is orderly and livable compared with such housing in cities like Chicago and Newark. The difference lies in the fact that New York City's tenants have historically consisted largely of working families who lived orderly lives and maintained coherent communities. This started to change when the Housing Authority dropped its meticulous screening procedures -- and adhered to Government regulations stipulating that 90 percent of public housing be set aside for the very poor, among them the homeless. 
 At the start of the 1980's, more than half the public housing tenants had jobs. By the mid-1990's, less than a third of households contained a working adult. Among families on the waiting list, less than 10 percent did. As the working population disappeared, the projects became less desirable and more dangerous, forcing out stable families.
Mr. Franco's plan would still preserve the bulk of public housing for the poorest of the poor. In the coming year, some 10,000 vouchers will go to the very poor, among them people from homeless shelters, to pay for housing in private buildings. Of the 8,000 apartments in public housing itself, half will be earmarked for the working poor -- families of four with a median income of $24,500 -- and half for the very poor.
This could make the wait for public housing longer. But those who do gain admittance will benefit from more orderly communities. By bringing middle-class normalcy to public housing, working families could make Federal support more palatable to taxpayers.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan, Economic Power Aside, Seems Paralyzed by Asia Crisis

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN with NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Dec. 17

 BODY:
As a financial crisis sweeps through Asia and provokes fears of a global downturn, Japan is the one economic force powerful enough to pull the region back to vitality.
The catch, however, is that Japan, the world's largest creditor nation, with an economy twice as large as all the rest of Asia, is not part of the solution but a major part of the problem. 
 Japan's leadership is in disarray, and has dithered for the last seven years of its own downturn. Many economists say that the Japanese Government -- by denying its problems or even dissembling about them -- has prolonged its own economic torment and contributed to the Asian financial crisis.
Today Japan announced $16 billion in tax cuts and later in the day plans to formally unveil a $77 billion bailout of its own financial mess -- a package bigger than the $57 billion International Monetary Fund rescue for South Korea. The scale is inevitable: the assets of a single Japanese bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, are roughly 10 times the size of the entire South Korean stock market.
Despite such plans, few analysts expect Japan to move decisively to address its own problems or Asia's.
"The extent of Japanese mismanagement of its own economy in the last seven years, particularly under Herbert Hoover Hashimoto, is one of the overwhelming themes of the modern era," said William H. Overholt, a managing director at Bankers Trust Company in Hong Kong.
While the parallel between Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and President Hoover may seem overblown, it is heard increasingly often these days among Mr. Hashimoto's foreign critics. Like Hoover in the beginning of the Great Depression, Mr. Hashimoto has adopted what some regard as a contractional fiscal policy in the face of a banking crisis and an overall economic slowdown.
And, as with Hoover's America, the downturn in Japan is not just a domestic problem; it is also slowing growth around the world. As the largest creditor nation, Japan is far and away the most important source of capital around the globe, and it helps feed America's enormous appetite for funds on a daily basis.
"The U.S. needs to borrow a billion dollars every day the markets open," said Kenneth S. Courtis, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Group Asia-Pacific. "And Japan is the principal supplier of that capital. If Japan gets knocked out of that equation, and instead of exporting capital it imports it, who could replace Japan? What would happen to the U.S. bond market? What would happen to Wall Street?"
One of Japan's biggest challenges is a vacuum of leadership. Mr. Hashimoto barely has command of parliament and his saving grace is only that the opposition is even more dispirited than he is. The Finance Ministry normally sets economic policy, without paying much attention to the Prime Minister, but lately the ministry has been under assault as well and is distracted by efforts to curb its power and break it up.
One of the most catastrophic missteps was the decision to emphasize fiscal austerity and raise the national sales tax this spring from 3 percent to 5 percent. The result was that the economy plunged at an annual rate of 11 percent in the second quarter, the worst figure in nearly 25 years, and economists are warning that Japan may now be on the brink of a recession.
It is not that no one warned Japan. Private economists there and the United States Government protested repeatedly that the tax increase would be more than the fragile economy could withstand.
 
A Mistaken Belief In Economy's Health
But Japanese officials were adamant, particularly those in the Ministry of Finance at the pinnacle of the nation's bureaucracy. They mistakenly believed that the economy was strong enough to tolerate the tax increase. Eisuke Sakakibara, a Vice Minister of Finance, as well as other officials, including Yasuo Matsushita, Governor of the Bank of Japan, repeatedly offered upbeat assessments of the economy that, in retrospect, could not have been further off the mark.
Mr. Sakakibara and Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka declined to be interviewed for this article. But the Government early this month formally acknowledged that the economy is not recovering after all, and that it is at a "standstill."
For now, Japan's most pressing problem is its banking crisis -- heightened by the risk of defaults in the coming weeks by South Korean banks. Japanese institutions have lent South Korea $24 billion, a monstrous sum that seems modest only when one compares it with the hundreds of billions of dollars in dubious loans within Japan.
"We're talking about the Asian financial crisis, but the biggest one is right here in Japan -- by far," said Richard Koo, an economist at Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo.
Japan's banks have been in trouble for seven years now, but they and the Government alike have yet to tackle the problem aggressively. Instead, the wounded banks have limped along, as Japanese officials played down the problems. But now some financial institutions have reached the end. One of Japan's 20 largest banks collapsed in November, and Yamaichi Securities, one of the "Big Four" securities firms, toppled a few days later.
What was particularly worrisome was not just that Yamaichi collapsed, but the way it fell. It kept insisting that it was solvent, and then after collapsing it turned out that it had an extra $2 billion in hidden losses. The Finance Ministry closely monitors the securities industry, and it either knew or did not know of these off-book losses; it is unclear which prospect is more alarming.
Even as the International Monetary Fund is urging Japan's neighbors to trim their growth, President Clinton has urged Japan to boost its economy from within. Such a policy could reduce the risk of a global financial meltdown and help the entire region emerge from its crisis.
This domestic boost could come in a couple of ways. Japan could try a fiscal stimulus, cutting taxes or raising Government spending, or it could deregulate the economy in hopes of generating an explosion of private spending. There is some evidence that concerted deregulation could set off a new Japanese boom.
 
Time May Be Right For Deregulation
In 1994, for example, Japan reluctantly agreed, under enormous American pressure, to deregulate its cellular telephone industry. A result was that the number of handsets increased more than 10-fold and cellular operators invested $13 billion in new systems. Moreover, Japan's engineers began to design more innovative telephones, including a Dick Tracy-like model built into a wristwatch.
Enthusiasts argue that if Japan could just muster the political will to address its bad-loan problems instead of letting them fester, if it could deregulate transportation, retailing, finance, agriculture, pharmaceuticals and other industries, one result would be a burst of energy that would revitalize Japan and stimulate all of Asia.
To be sure, Mr. Hashimoto has pledged to achieve far-reaching economic and governmental reforms or else "burn up in flames," and he is presiding over preparations for a "Big Bang" that would introduce greater competition into finance. But the pattern has been that far-reaching deregulation is proposed, debated, opposed by entrenched interests, and then emasculated by Mr. Hashimoto's colleagues in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
This has frustrated foreigners and Japanese alike.
"With Japanese politics, people will very often say they're going to do it, but it takes a long time before they reach a final conclusion," said Minoru Makihara, president of Mitsubishi Corporation. "However, I think time and speed is of the essence."
Prime Minister Hashimoto is reluctant to stimulate the economy the other way, by cutting taxes or increasing Government spending, because of a profound commitment to fiscal prudence and aversion to deficit spending. Mr. Hashimoto argues that deficit spending would be particularly irresponsible now because Japan's population is aging rapidly and will require enormous spending in the decades ahead.
 
A Declining Yen Might Hurt All Asia
The slowdown in Japan and the risk of a steeper recession are central to the current Asian economic crisis. Japan's position as the leading source of capital around the world means that if Japan's banks continue to falter, the pipeline of loans and investments could collapse. Nations in Asia need to export to Japan to boost their economies, but a depressed Japan is not in a position to buy those goods.
A continued fall in the yen could harm the competitiveness of products from elsewhere in Asia, creating a risk of competitive devaluations in the region. If Japan now allows the yen to fall further, so that its exports can compete against those from South Korea, then China and other countries might be tempted to follow, setting off a dizzying downward spiral.
A related risk is that Japan and others will try to export their way out of the crisis. But this strategy would produce a torrent of imports in the United States just as there are signs that the American consensus in favor of free trade may be eroding.
"I'm hopeful we will not have a repetition of the 1920's and 1930's, Smoot-Hawley and the beggar-thy-neighbor trade policies, but human beings are imperfect," said Michel Oksenberg, an Asia expert at Stanford University.
 
Failure by Tokyo To Take Larger Role
One of the central ironies is that Japan has long yearned for a larger role in Asia. So, this should be Japan's big moment, an occasion when it could win Asia's gratitude for rescuing the region from economic turmoil. But instead, Japan is too mired in its own problems to be of much help.
"Japanese people are worried about Asia, but they are more worried about Japan itself," said Yoshihide Soeya, a scholar of international relations at Keio University in Tokyo. "Instead of helping Asia out, Japan itself wants to be helped out."
Prime Minister Hashimoto himself recently expressed the nation's mood when he announced that Japan was "certainly not arrogant enough to think that we can take the role of locomotive for Asia."
One result is that Japan's role in the Asia crisis has been largely as banker and follower, taking the roles assigned by the United States Treasury Department. Japan put up $10 billion for the South Korean rescue package, twice as much as the United States, but the rescue was orchestrated from Washington.
"There's an increasing tendency to look to the U.S. and the I.M.F. as the savior, rather than to Japan," noted Muthiah Alagappa, a specialist on Southeast Asia at the East-West Center in Hawaii.
To be sure, Japan did try to take on an important role as organizer of a proposed "Asian Monetary Fund," intended to help bail out troubled Asian economies. Some countries welcomed that idea, but the United States squashed it out of concern that the fund would tread on the turf of the International Monetary Fund.
During the last couple of years, Japan has set what is generally regarded as a miserable example, allowing huge speculative bubbles and enormous bad loans to accumulate without anyone paying much attention.
Moreover, for nearly a decade into the mid-1990's, as the yen strengthened under the backing of officials in Washington and Tokyo, Japanese loans and investment poured into Asian countries, boosting local economies but also sending stock and property markets soaring. A result was that Japan's bubble floated across Asia.
Then back home, Japan's financial crisis led the Government to strike a deal with the United States to allow the yen to drop, and as a result the yen has lost about 60 percent of its value since its peak in 1995. As the yen dropped, Asian exports began losing out to cheaper Japanese products. Trade deficits yawned, and then this year the crisis hit when currencies tumbled and countries found it difficult to pay back foreign currency loans to Japanese and American banks.
The underlying lesson from Japan's missteps in handling its own economic crisis may be that markets have become too large and global to be managed by Japanese Government bureaucrats. For seven years, Japan's bureaucrats have been wrestling with market forces, trying to force them into submission, but the recent bankruptcies in Japan -- which the Finance Ministry could do little to prevent -- suggest that it is the bureaucrats who are now at the mercy of the market.
Some say that the bureaucrats may now learn the lesson and reluctantly bow to market forces, allowing Japan and the rest of Asia to boom again.
"This is the revolt of the market against Government," Takeshi Sasaki, a political scientist at Tokyo University, said of Asia's crisis. "It will be the only good historical opportunity to integrate politics and the market, to show politicians that they should not ignore the market."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Asia's Faltering Giant"
As currency and financial crises roil its smaller Asian neighbors, Japan and the shaky health of its economy loom ever larger in calculations of the region's chances of righting itself.
 
Measured in yen, the Japanese economy has been growing in fits and starts since early 1993, but viewed in dollar terms, the total value of Japan's output of goods and services has fallen by more than a fifth since the summer of 1995. Chart tracks gross domestic product, in dollars, quarterly at annual rate, adjusted for Japanese inflation, since 1989.
 
A group of indicators that are supposed to presage turns in the economy nine months to a year ahead, have been giving pessimis-tic readings all year. Thus, even without the recent turmoil in Asia, Japan could not expect robust growth in 1998. Chart tracks index of leading indicators, monthly, since 1989.
 
Japan remains a major net exporter of capital, meaning it is lending vast sums to other nations, mainly the United States. Some analysts worry that the cost of restor-ing Japan's banks to financial health may crimp future capital flows out of Japan.

HEADLINE: Hopping Off Soon in Brooklyn: Tours by Double-Decker Bus

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
With guided tours and scheduled stops along Manhattan's major traffic routes, tour buses have become a popular way for tourists to visit the borough's many attractions, like the Empire State Building, the World Trade Center and Harlem churches.
And soon, double-decker tour buses may also be prowling the streets of Brooklyn, offering stops to enjoy the cheesecake at Junior's restaurant or the permanent collection of ancient Egyptian art in the Brooklyn Museum of Art. 
 New York Apple Tours, the largest double-decker sightseeing company in the city, said it plans to start running tour buses in the borough next year, if it gets the required approval.
"We're going to extend our Manhattan routes so our clients will have a chance to experience a real hidden treasure: the Borough of Brooklyn," said Michael Alvich, who is the vice president of sales and marketing at New York Apple Tours. "It's about time that people learn about Brooklyn."
Mr. Alvich said the route is an extension of the two-day full city tour, which currently costs $30. He said that although the route has not been finally determined and the starting date has yet to be set, the company plans to begin the service at the soon-to-be-completed Marriott Hotel in downtown Brooklyn.
He said the route would include 13 stops and cover major commercial and tourist attractions, like the Metrotech Center, Junior's restaurant, the Middle Eastern stores on Atlantic Avenue, and places like the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the Brooklyn Children's Museum in Crown Heights.
In recent years, the number of buses have drawn criticism in some Manhattan neighborhoods, where residents say they add to congestion on small streets and spout exhaust fumes. But so far, there has been little opposition in Brooklyn, where officials have been trying to get in on the city's tourism boom.
"I have fought for more than 20 years to have Brooklyn included as a major tourism destination," Howard Golden, the Brooklyn Borough President, said. "I'm pleased that New York Apple Tours has taken an interest in the borough."
Kenneth Adams, president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, said that the hop-on, hop-off concept was particularly appealing, because it would enable visitors to spend more time in the Brooklyn neighborhoods along the route. He said this would have a ripple effect on the local economy.
"Instead of touring Brooklyn through tinted windows on a moving bus," he said, "this plan will allow them to visit the local shops and spend their money in the borough."
Mr. Alvich said the idea came from Mitchell Heymann, the director of sales and marketing for the New York Marriott Brooklyn. The 374-room hotel will open sometime in the spring. Mr. Heymann said he approached New York Apple Tours because of its tourist-friendly concept.
"Our goal is not only to bring in business clients but also to sell Brooklyn as a tourist destination," Mr. Heymann said.
But not all of Brooklyn's landmark attractions will be included. Coney Island -- with its aquarium, the 85-foot, 76-year-old Cyclone roller coaster and Nathan's hot dog stand -- is notably missing from the plan. Savy Grant, a vice president at New York Apple Tours, said additional sites would be added as demand for them increases.
Ms. Grant said the plan still has to be approved by the City Department of Transportation.

HEADLINE: Panel Seeks to Simplify Grand Jury Duty Vagaries

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
Having improved the lot of New Yorkers called for jury service, court administrators announced this week that they would now train their gaze on a far more miserable civic responsibility -- grand jury duty.
Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye has directed a panel to report by next March on ways to overhaul a system that is inconsistently operated throughout the state and out of step with much of the country. 
 Unlike conventional jury service, where people are screened to sit on a single trial, grand jurors hear evidence for dozens of felonies and vote on whether cases should be indicted. Around the state, the average length of service for a trial jury, formally known as a petit jury, is 3 days; grand jurors typically serve 11 days and service can be as long as 28 days.
In some counties, grand jurors may meet for a full day a week over three months, while in others, they may gather several mornings or afternoons a week. Although the length of service for petit jurors has shrunk in the last few years because of improvements in the system, grand jury service has not changed.
Only 25,000 New Yorkers serve each year as grand jurors, compared with 500,000 who show up for regular jury duty. But grand jury fees account for nearly 20 percent of all juror costs. Stephen Kaufman, a prominent defense lawyer who is chairman of the panel of defense lawyers, prosecutors and judges, said that evaluating efficiency would be a high priority.
"One grand jury was called for July 5 and there were no cases for it," he said. "Other times, jurors can't deliberate because a quorum hasn't shown up." In New York, 23 people are convened for a grand jury and at least 16 have to be present for deliberations and a vote.
According to the State Constitution, the prosecution of a felony must be sanctioned through an indictment by a grand jury, whose institutional purpose is to protect innocent citizens from unjust prosecutions. But two-thirds of the states around the country have eliminated the need for most grand juries out of concern for juror fees, the inconvenience to the jurors themselves and the difficulty in assembling witnesses. Instead, they have adopted simpler methods to screen cases at an early stage.
Robert G. M. Keating, a former judge who is vice chairman of the project, said that the Grand Jury Project would study those alternatives. California uses a preliminary hearing at which evidence is presented before a judge in open court.
This project's predecessor, the 1993 Jury Project, produced recommendations that led to a wholesale revamping of the state's jury system by legislators and court officials. Automatic exemptions for 20 occupations have been eliminated and sources for jurors have been expanded to include not only those once exempted professionals but people on unemployment and welfare rolls. That means people are called less frequently and serve shorter terms.
Their lives as jurors have improved as well. Furniture in jury rooms has been upgraded. And the selection of civil juries, once ruled by lawyers, is now overseen by judges, quickening the pace considerably.
The Grand Jury Project is expected to go about its business in a fashion similar to that of its forebear. Questionnaires will be handed out to grand jurors and public hearings will be convened. And those inspired to comment will be encouraged to call 1-800-NYJUROR.

HEADLINE: Citta di Castello;
White Truffles Are to Die For, but Not Like This

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: CITTA DI CASTELLO, Italy, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Two more truffle-hunting dogs died of poisoning in the wooded hills of northern Umbria on the day that Fabio Petruzzi, out hunting woodcock, almost lost his Lolla.
A spirited 3-year-old English setter, she too had wolfed down some raw meat laced with strychnine, took a few wobbly steps and collapsed to the ground. Mr. Petruzzi was able to carry her a half-mile to his car, and get her in time to Dr. Luigi Bigi, the local veterinarian, to save her life. 
 The other two dogs -- which belonged to a weekend truffle hunter from nearby Perugia -- were not so lucky, and on Dec. 6, became the latest victims in a sinister wave of dog killings that has swept these truffle-rich hills.
No one can say exactly how many dogs have been killed this season but Dr. Bigi -- who has become the local expert on death by strychnine, and metaldeide, a pesticide -- says he has seen 20 to 25 dead or dying dogs, more than twice the number he saw last year during the white-truffle season, which lasts from mid-October to Dec. 31.
"Everyone is afraid for their dogs," Dr. Bigi said. "And there is a lot of anger. Whether you talk to truffle hunters or hunters, everyone is angry. And if they ever catch the guy who's doing this, they will never turn him in -- they'll lynch him. One man whose dog died frightened me: he said he would take care of it himself. So who's to say that he won't go out and put out his own poisoned meatballs?"
There was a time when the pursuit of the white truffle, the popular name for Tuber Magantum pico, prized for its musky, pungent taste, was not such a deadly business. Truffle hunters would scour the woods of the upper Tiber Valley with their dogs, mixed-breeds specially trained to sniff out the misshapen fungi that grow wild among tree roots, and casually sell their finds by the fistful, without even weighing them.
But since the 1980's, the price of white truffles -- found only here and a few other parts of Italy -- has skyrocketed, as middlemen rushed into the market to supply restaurants from Tokyo to New York. This season, after a dry summer that reduced supply, the price jumped again -- some say by 30 percent, and with retail prices locally now at $1,300 a kilo (2.2 pounds), the competition for truffles, already fierce, became even more murderous.
"It is a mathematical question," said Pierluigi Manfroni, owner of a local restaurant called Bersaglio who buys truffles for his house specialities directly from local trufflers. "Truffles are profitable to those who find them, and in the last 15 years, the value has increased incredibly. That is the cause of the rivalry between them. There is no other explanation."
Truffle hunting is a secretive business -- Mr. Manfroni talks of the "omerta of the truffle," borrowing the Sicilian Mafia's term for their deadly bond of silence. "For generations, hunters have known where the truffles can be found," he said. "A truffle hunter doesn't want 10 other hunters in his area."
Not everyone can go truffling: to qualify for a Government license, trufflers must pay $130 a year, and pass an exam that entitles them to hunt year around. The white truffle is the most precious, but there are other varieties, each with its own season -- the "bianchetto," the "scorsone" and then the ordinary black truffle. Of the 7,000 licensed trufflers in all of Italy, 1,832 are here in the upper Tiber Valley, and that, according to some veterans, is too many.
"It used to be that truffle hunting was a matter of time, and passion," said Paolo Puletti, a local journalist who was the first to uncover the trail of the poisoned dogs. "Now it is all economics. People give up their holidays to go truffle hunting: you can earn $12,000 in a good season, equal to an annual salary."
After the rush of international publicity that has followed the spate of dog-poisonings, truffle hunters have become defensive about the implication that the dog-slayer is one of their own, and some are now pointing the finger elsewhere, at local game hunters among others.
"I don't exclude that truffle hunters could be doing this, but it does seem to coincide with the hunting season," said Alessandro Ghigi, president of the local truffle hunters' association.
Vincenzo Bucci, head of the regional forestry preserve, tries to take a balanced position, mindful that the poison set out for dogs could spread to relations among their owners. "We have to isolate these incidents, but not stress the divisions within the community," he said. "It could be someone who has gone crazy -- it could be shepherds trying to eliminate stray dogs, it could be conflicts between hunters and farmers, or it could be control of territory on the part of the trufflers."
Local truffle hunters say they have detected a pattern in the distribution of the poisoned meat patties. "Truffles don't grow everywhere, it is always the same places," said Angelino Marioli, a veteran truffle hunter who spends five or six hours a day in the woods with his dogs. "There are a lot of secret places that people don't talk about, but everyone goes to the best-known places -- which is where all the dogs have died."
To dedicated trufflers, nothing is more precious than their dogs, which they spend four or five years training to seek out a smell that uninitiated hounds, and foxes, naturally turn up their noses at. A good dog can cost $1,300 to $4,000, but the emotional attachment counts even more.
"For me, my dogs are like members of my family," said Sebastiano Adriano, a barber and part-time truffler who lost a dog to poison during last year's truffle season.
"If I knew who was doing it, I wouldn't be here: I'd be in jail, because I would have killed him," he said. "I could understand it if when I took someone else's truffle, they took it out on me. But not my dog."

Mahathir's Wrath

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN; Bob Herbert is on vacation.

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia

 BODY:
There are many ways to depict Malaysia's economic crisis. My preference would be to stage it as an Off Broadway play. It would be called "King Lear Meets the Hedge Funds."
King Lear, of course, could only properly be played by Malaysia's Prime Minister, Dr. Mohamed Mahathir. Dr. Mahathir has made a career of tweaking the West and America, lecturing them about everything from the superiority of the Asian model to the blatant unfairness of how the great powers have carved up Antarctica. Along the way, Dr. Mahathir has also overseen Malaysia's economic boom, and made his country a model of multi-ethnic harmony and a beacon for how the Muslim world can embrace modernization. 
 But after the Asian market crash spread to Malaysia, Dr. Mahathir went into one of his anti-colonial nationalist rants. He accused the Jews, George Soros and the hedge funds of deliberately wrecking Malaysia's economy. "Jews are not happy to see Muslims prosper," he said.
Global money managers did not take kindly to such talk. They are not like Dr. Mahathir's usual targets of tweaking. They aren't the U.N. or the State Department or the Nonaligned Movement. They don't tell you that you have a point, or that they feel your pain, or that they understand your grievance because of your colonial experience. They listen to what you mean, not what you say, and what Dr. Mahathir's words meant to them was that he was more interested in looking for scapegoats than at the real problems. So the foreign banks and funds, already spooked by Asia's currency crisis, lost even more confidence in Malaysia and began dumping its currency and stocks, sending both to record lows.
But King Lear kept on lecturing. When his Finance Minister announced plans to halt some major showpiece projects, to signal austerity, King Lear said the projects were still on, and he condemned foreign investors for being too greedy. "Will the Milkens and Boeskys and Soroses of the future be any more considerate than the present models?" he said, referring to the financiers Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky and George Soros -- all Jews, none of whom triggered Malaysia's plight.
It's true that Malaysia's fundamentals were not that bad: low inflation, a budget surplus, a well-run central bank and Finance Ministry, high domestic savings, strong export industries. Its weakness was large debts run up by the private sector that produced a real estate bubble. But Dr. Mahathir's tirade turned a small crisis of confidence in Malaysia into a big crisis of confidence. Said one official, "He's Malaysia's I.B.M. -- International Big Mouth."
Veiled criticism has started to appear even in Malaysia's controlled press, and this seems to have prompted Dr. Mahathir to take a vow of silence, for the moment. One commentator, A. Nazri Abdullah, wrote: "Foreign investors recognize Malaysian fundamentals are strong, but they are confused by conflicting statements from our top leaders. If we have the desire to speak out, we need to moderate that desire. . . . There is no point in cheering loudest if your village is then mortgaged. We only have rifles without bullets, so why shoot hot air?"
The sad part is that "Dr. Mahathir has a point -- he just has the wrong target," argued the Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs. "He's right that there is something wrong if for a decade the market tells your country that it's an economic miracle, and then, with no warning, engages in waves of panic selling that cuts off all your access to short-term credit and causes your currency and stock markets to crash." And he's right that if Malaysia's businesses borrowed too much from Western bankers, that may have been reckless of the Malaysians, but it was equally reckless of the bankers. "For every reckless borrower, there is a reckless lender," said Mr. Sachs.
In short, Dr. Mahathir is right that a system that can be spooked so easily, that can sour on the fundamentals of Southeast Asia so quickly and can overlook its own banking weaknesses so cavalierly, is troubling. But by crudely and stupidly explaining this as a Jewish plot, Dr. Mahathir, the Asian leader who could have most effectively led a discussion about how to reform this system, has discredited himself, hurt his country and only further muddied an already muddled situation.

Prices Lower On Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities traded lower yesterday, pushing the yield on the long bond back up to 6 percent.
Although there were no Government reports, bonds followed the United States dollar down after Japan unexpectedly announced a plan to cut income taxes and the Bank of Japan became a seller of dollars. Investors become jittery when the dollar declines because a strong dollar makes United States Government securities much more attractive to foreign investors, who benefit from potential gains in currency translation as well as generally higher rates. 
 The 30-year bond fell 17/32, to 101 25/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, was up to 5.996 percent, which when rounded off is 6 percent. This is up from 5.96 percent on Tuesday.
Traders said the news of Japan's intention to cut taxes and revive its economy took its toll on the United States bond market because many thought it might end the buying of Treasuries by investors seeking a safe haven from the Asian turmoil. In just over a month and a half bond yields have dropped more than 40 basis points as a result of those Asian troubles. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)
The Treasury yesterday also announced that it plans to sell $26 billion of two-year and five-year notes next week. The $15 billion in two-year notes will be sold on Monday along with $14.5 billion in three-month and six-month bills normally sold on Monday. On Tuesday the Treasury will sell $11 billion of five-year notes. The note auctions are a day early because next week will be shortened by the Christmas holiday and the start of a long weekend by many.
In when-issued trading, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.67 percent and the five-year at a price to yield 5.74 percent. The possibility of fewer buyers of Treasury securities if the Asia turmoil subsides causes Treasury prices to drop.
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., does not think the proposed tax cut in Japan is large enough to stimulate the ailing Japanese economy and thereby keep United States yields low.
Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities, believes the lower dollar represents a buying opportunity, saying, "The Bank of Japan foreign exchange intervention, rumored to be $4 billion, has also weighed on the U.S. dollar."
Ms. Cooper said the relief package might keep the Japanese economy from slumping lower, but the gap between United States and Japanese gross domestic product growth should remain wide enough to keep the dollar strong. "With the Bank of Japan on hold for the foreseeable future, short-term interest rate spreads of over 500 basis points between the U.S. and Japanese securities will continue to keep capital flowing to the U.S.," she said. "The U.S. bond market's fundamentals remain strong, especially with Treasury supply dwindling and inflation subdued. While hiccups are bound to occur, decisive moves above 6 percent on the long bond provide attractive buying opportunities."

South Korea Delays Plans To Inject Money Into Banks

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The Government postponed plans today to inject money into six of South Korea's biggest banks, meeting a demand of the International Monetary Fund one day before the agency was to decide whether to release the second installment of a $57 billion rescue package.
Seoul has promised to let ailing financial institutions fail or be taken over as a condition for receiving loans arranged by the I.M.F. The nation is counting on the next installment of the rescue package signed Dec. 3 to help pay billions of dollars in foreign debt due by the end of the year. 
 The Government had planned on injecting as much as $1.3 billion of capital into the Korea Development Bank, the Industrial Bank of Korea, Cho Hung Bank, Hanil Bank, the Commercial Bank of Korea and Korea Exchange Bank -- the largest borrowers of overseas capital. But in a step viewed as meeting an important I.M.F. condition, that plan was delayed.
"We think these six banks still have the ability to raise more funds overseas if the Government assists them in a proper way," said Choi Joong Kyung, a financial policy director at the Ministry of Finance and Economy.
The I.M.F. has said it wants bondholders and shareholders to feel the pain of poor lending decisions made by South Korean banks before they are offered more capital.
The Government was still proceeding with plans today to provide emergency financing for brokerage firms, which like many banks are swamped in debt. Two of South Korea's 34 brokerage firms failed this month after banks quit lending to them.
It was unclear whether that commitment would be viewed as inconsistent with South Korea's pledges to the I.M.F.
The lending agency was scheduled to meet in Washington on Thursday to decide whether to release the next installment of the South Korea loan package, worth $3.6 billion.
Optimism that the worst of the South Korean crisis may have passed helped its stock market rise 3.5 percent today, the fourth straight increase. But its currency, the won, fell 4 percent, narrowing strong gains made the previous two days.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall as Lower Earnings Are Expected

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Wall Street quickly brushed aside a rally in Asia yesterday, as news of unexpected fourth-quarter earnings shortfalls pushed most major stock market indexes lower for the first time this week.
The fact that stocks did not respond to positive news from Asia indicates that earnings worries might become a bigger factor in investor decisions in the near term. The recent rise of the dollar and the slower growth expected in Asia are leading many analysts to trim their earnings expectations for 1998. 
 A stronger dollar reduces foreign earnings when they are translated back into dollars. The stronger currency also makes American exports less competitive abroad, cutting sales.
The Asian rally was fueled by news that the Japanese Prime Minister, Ruytaro Hashimoto, unexpectedly called for more than $15 billion in income tax cuts in an effort to stimulate the nation's economy. That move pushed the country's benchmark stock index, the Nikkei 225, up 3.5 percent. Stock markets in Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan were also higher.
And in the United States, the American depository receipts of several Japanese companies, including Ito-Yokado, Canon, Matsuhita Electric, Misui, Sony, TDK Corporation finished higher.
Initially, American investors reacted favorably to the news. In early trading, the Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 57 points. But news from the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company that fourth-quarter earnings will be more than 10 percent below the company's current estimates overwhelmed the market and spurred a round of selling that sent the Dow Jones industrial average down 18.90 points, to 7,957.41.
Minnesota Mining, or 3M, which fell 9 points, to 84 7/8, also helped lead the Standard & Poor's 500-company stock index down 2.50 points, to 965.54. 3M was the S.& P. 500's second- largest decliner behind Microsoft, which fell 3 7/16, to 135 5/8.
Meanwhile, the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index slipped for the second time this week, and closed at 1,547.37, down 5.63 points.
A diversified manufacturing company whose products include Scotch tape and Post-it notes, 3M was expected to earn $1.01 a share, up from 90 cents last year, according to analysts' forecasts. But currency declines in Asia, Brazil and Japan are expected to trim fourth-quarter profit by 10 percent, the company said, when those revenue are translated back into a much stronger dollar. Last year, 15 percent of sales and 25 percent of earnings were derived from Asia, analysts said.
Several analysts said that 1998 earnings could also be affected. The company earned $1.05 in the third quarter and $3.63 in 1996.
While 3M's announcement was largely viewed as a sign that other companies with exposure to overseas markets could see earnings shortfalls, its problems extend beyond its exposure to foreign markets, said Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. "The surprise was the margins in the U.S. business," Mr. Acuff said.
"Profit margins seem to be under pressure from slower growth in the U.S. and higher expenses."
According to a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, Jonathan Rosenzweig, the United States shortfall is due to softness in sectors, including tapes, electrical products, automotive and roofing products.
And although the United States economy is expected to continue to grow in 1998, growth will be slower. As a result, "the margin squeeze will be visible for more companies," Mr. Acuff warned. "That's the irony. On the surface, it looks great, but there's not as much strength as the economy would suggest."
Another warning sign of slower-than-expected growth in 1998 is a larger than expected number of negative earnings pre-announcements for the fourth quarter of this year, said Charles L. Hill, director of research at the First Call Corporation. So far, 288 companies have issued comments about fourth-quarter earnings and 51 percent were negative, Mr. Hill said.
Those announcements and concerns about the impact of Asia's financial crisis have also caused analysts to lower fourth-quarter earnings estimates. In the last four weeks, analysts' revisions have lowered the fourth quarter growth rate for S.& P. 500 companies to 8.8 percent from 12.2 percent. Meanwhile, analysts are forecasting about 17.2 percent growth for the S.& P. 500 in the first quarter of 1998.
"This is certainly more than we normally get," Mr. Hill said of the fourth-quarter revisions. As a result, "it's unrealistic to expect that earnings will be up 17.2 percent if they're only up 8.8 percent in the fourth quarter," he cautioned.

HEADLINE: On the Road to Monterrey;
Success of Mexican Bus Companies Eludes Greyhound

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: SAN MIGUEL DE ALEMAN, Mexico

 BODY:
In the borderland battle of the bus lines, Omar Rendon is the quarry. At 2:30 A.M. on a recent Saturday, he sat on a stoop at a border station here in the Rio Grande Valley, his Igloo cooler by his side as he stoically recounted his nearly weekly migration.
Most Friday nights, Mr. Rendon, who installs insulation at chemical plants in Houston, makes the 9- or 10-hour overnight bus trip to Mexico to see his wife and children in Monterrey, and most Sunday nights returns north. "We want to avoid the drugs and the crime" in the United States, he explained, as the customs inspector taped seals across the luggage compartments of the Adame Tours bus he was about to reboard. "I brought them up to live with me a few years ago, but the neighbors weren't even friendly. We didn't feel safe enough to go for a walk at night. My wife didn't like it at all." 
 So many others want to work in the United States but live in Mexico that the demand for bus seats across the border has reached an estimated four million annually, growing by about 20 percent a year. No American bus line, though, has permission to cross the Texas border and offer direct service to the Mexican interior. The North American Free Trade Agreement ostensibly opened the border to bus traffic last year, but a diplomatic snarl has officially kept it closed.
But while lawyers and diplomats haggle in distant capitals, resourceful immigrants have built bus lines like Adame. Beginning with a few battered vans about two decades ago, they persuaded American authorities to let them stay in business while they grew. Mexican officials, they say, usually let their buses pass -- in return for payments that have become as much a cost of business as gasoline or tires.
Greyhound Lines Inc., now the only coast-to-coast bus system, has thus had to stand by as far smaller competitors came to dominate a promising market. Greyhound, too large and visible to get away with making the payoffs needed to go south, and too clumsy to find other solutions, has been left begging for a deal with Mexico -- or at least tougher enforcement of the laws on both sides of the border.
Having only recently halted a loss of passengers, Greyhound considers a bid for the Hispanic travel market in general -- and cross-border traffic in particular -- so crucial that its chief executive, Craig R. Lentzsch, led his board on a tour of Houston's Hispanic bus stations on Dec. 8. Greyhound is also in partnership talks with the owners of Turismos Rapidos, one of the largest American bus lines serving Hispanic people. In frank imitation, Greyhound is even setting up a Spanish-speaking version of itself, called S.I.T.A. Inc.
A lot is at stake. Frequent, low-cost transportation, often on buses more comfortable than Greyhound's, allows more Mexicans to live and work on opposite sides of the border.
In coming to the United States, Mexicans have brought their bus service with them. With a population only a third as large as America's, Mexicans take 10 times as many bus trips, or more than 250 million trips a year longer than 100 miles.
Forget the stereotypes of rattling Mexican buses with pigs and chickens snuffling and squawking in the aisles. If United States buses are largely for the poor and humble, Mexico's plush, modern buses have become the prime means of long-distance travel. "The Mexican system is moving north," said Earl Shorris, author of "Latinos: A Biography of the People" (W. W. Norton, 1992). "We're importing Mexican cultural values."
The Tex-Mex bus lines are so significant for the Hispanic community that the Commerce Department has given Houston a $75,000 grant to study their potential for furthering economic development.
Houston's old Magnolia neighborhood, a barrio east of downtown, has become the Mexican gateway not only for Texas but also for all the Eastern and Central United States. Hispanic bus and van lines feed passengers from as far away as Chicago, Miami and New York to destinations as distant as Mexico City and Oaxaca, but to Monterrey most of all. The scrap-metal dealers and taco stands along Harrisburg Boulevard are giving way to bus stations, with three of the largest on the corners opposite the Houston Metro bus station. With more than 100 daily departures, the Hispanic bus lines handle more than half as much traffic as the Greyhound station downtown.
Friday nights are busiest. By 7 P.M., the crowds at Adame spill out of the cramped waiting room onto wooden benches outside. A ticket to Monterrey costs only $38, or $60 round trip, for a journey longer than that from Boston to Washington.
At the counter, ticket agents and company officials jostle and untangle the cords to four constantly ringing phones. They tell callers that three, maybe four buses will leave at 8:30 or later, but everyone knows that the first bus usually pulls out closer to 7:30.
Most passengers on a recent Friday were men. Though Mr. Rendon's brother, Beto, goes home as often as he does, most go down about five or six times a year and stay longer.
The first bus had a full load -- 47 passengers, mostly members of a weary but upbeat emerging middle class. With curtained windows and cushioned reserved seats that tilted far back, the nearly new Dina Marcopolo G1000 bus had Mexican films on video monitors every few rows until nearly midnight, then Mexican and Tejano music the rest of the way. There had been coffee and pastries back at the terminal, and on board was a cooler of free soft drinks.
More than half the passengers own cars, Adame's managers say. But only on the bus can travelers get enough sleep to allow a weekend visit. Snapping his flip phone shut after saying goodbye to his wife, Rodrigo Gonzalez, who operates construction machinery, said he visits his parents in Monterrey by himself a few times a year. "The bus is very comfortable, and it costs me less than gas," he said.
When Mr. Lentzsch looked around Harrisburg Boulevard a few hours before the board was expected, he learned more than he had anticipated. Spotting an old Greyhound bus, with only the dog logos removed, at Autobuses Monterrey across the street from Adame, Mr. Lentzsch strode onto the cracked, weed-grown lot for a closer look.
Soon, Walter Price, the operations manager, came over to explain that Autobuses Monterrey had bought four used Greyhound buses. But even with permits to operate in Mexico, which two of the buses already had, crossing the border still required cash. "Mordida," he said, rubbing the fingertips on his right hand together. An Autobuses Monterrey executive said that $50 usually went to Mexican immigration officers, $50 for customs, and $20 more at a second customs checkpoint down the road.
"I've been trying to get those prices for a long time," Mr. Lentzsch said as he walked away. "But what am I going to do? Hand my drivers 100 bucks in cash?"
He grants that Greyhound would be far stronger along the border but for its own faults -- labor strife, management turmoil, a bankruptcy filing and another near-collapse (under previous management, Mr. Lentzsch was quick to point out). In 1990, after Greyhound was hit by a strike, the Houston companies began buying their first buses, however dilapidated.
Esteban Adame may have been the first to carry fellow immigrants back to Monterrey, beginning with a used station wagon in 1977, then graduating to vans. This was frontier capitalism: seldom did the early van owners steer through the maze of permits and licenses they theoretically needed, Federal officials say, although Mr. Adame says he abided by the laws.
Mr. Adame built his van fleet to 15, then, in 1991, bought two 13-year-old buses. A few years later, as interest rates fell and creditors saw that the Tex-Mex bus lines were sound risks, the companies graduated to new models. In 1994, Mr. Adame began buying new buses and now has about 30 and plans to add 20 more next year. In Mexico, he has charter and temporary authority, having formed a Mexican company, El Faisan, to help secure permanent rights.
The van operators that survive are being squeezed by the bus lines. Several blocks from Harrisburg Boulevard, Juan Hernandez has a shack for an office, a cement porch with old van seats for a waiting room. Even for $30 to Monterrey, he has fewer and fewer takers, but stays afloat by carrying packages often filled with merchandise that Mexicans believe is best bought in the United States.
"How much?" asked one Friday night customer, presenting a box with several large coffee cans and bottles of liquid detergent.
Mr. Hernandez counted, pondered, then struck a deal at $15. "I won't keep more than $5," Mr. Hernandez added in an aside, noting the tips needed to get the goods across the border.
While Mexican and American bus companies can already drop passengers just across the border, in California Greyhound joined with a Mexican partner to begin service to the Mexican interior in January. In Texas, though, Greyhound has yet to find a partner.
The Hispanic bus lines' Mexican routes are part of a national network. Adame's buses run from as far away as Atlanta and the Carolinas through Houston on the way to Mexico. New York is linked to the Hispanic network by La Cubana, with daily trips from Broadway and 174th Street in Manhattan to Miami, where the bus line is based, and twice weekly to Atlanta. At these destinations passengers can connect to a Tex-Mex line, El Expreso.
Mr. Adame, confirming the Autobuses Monterrey account of what it costs to cross the border, nodded as an aide reported higher demands before Christmas. Alfonso Euarro, the manager of bus service permits in the Monterrey region, said he had not heard of any such payments.
Greyhound complains that American regulators are selective in their safety enforcement, but regulators disagree. "If you've got 2,000 vehicles out there, you're much more likely to be subject to inspection than if you have one bus," said Nat Jackson, the Federal Highway Administration's chief of bus line regulation for the Southwest. He has given some bus and van lines a few months to shape up and operate safely, but notes that through May this year, more than 19 van lines going between Houston or Dallas and Mexico were fined a total of $33,000.
Adame, fully licensed in the United States, sometimes switches to El Faisan buses at the border, but on a recent Friday night took its own bus straight through, arriving in Monterrey shortly before 5 A.M.
Competition? Mr. Adame notes that Greyhound's past efforts to set up a Hispanic unit have posed no threat. "Greyhound said, 'You are just small ants,' " he recalled with a chuckle.
For even as Adame, Turismos Rapidos and the like have become assimilated in the American legal and economic system, they let their passengers continue living in two worlds.

HEADLINE: Airline Wins Suit on Weight Limits of Attendants

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
New York's highest court ruled yesterday that Delta Air Lines did not violate state law when it refused to hire job applicants who exceeded the company's weight limitations for flight attendants, and said it did not discriminate against the applicants by asking their age and marital status.
But paradoxically, the court suggested that the applicants were not sufficiently overweight to be considered disabled, which would have allowed them legal protections against discrimination. 
 The case stems from Delta's refusal to hire nine job applicants in 1990, on the ground that they were overweight. The applicants -- former flight attendants for Pan American World Airways, each with at least 14 years of experience -- had claimed the company discriminated on the basis of a "perceived disability."
In its unanimous decision yesterday, the seven-member State Court of Appeals ruled that there was no discrimination against the applicants on the basis of their weight because they did not suffer from "gross obesity."
"We are satisfied that weight, in and of itself, does not constitute a disability for discrimination qualification purposes," Judge Joseph W. Bellacosa's ruling said.
According to their lawyer, James Strauss, the job applicants were 2 to 10 pounds over the company's weight limits. "If they were clinically obese," Mr. Strauss said yesterday, "they would have had a better shot."
The plaintiffs had also charged the company with violating state law by maintaining different weight standards for men and women. According to court papers, the company set a maximum weight of 153 pounds for a 45-year-old woman who was 5 feet, 6 inches tall. The maximum weight for a man of the same age and height was 157 pounds.
But the court ruled that the company had used separate weight standards "based on real physiological differences."
Yesterday, a Delta spokesman, Todd Clay, refused to comment on whether the company still maintains weight standards.
But a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants, the union that represents 42,000 flight attendants but does not represent Delta's, said most airlines had dropped weight requirements in recent years.
"The main question is, can a flight attendant perform their safety duties?" the spokeswoman, Jane Goodman, said. "That's what they are there to do. They are not there to be Barbie dolls."
The nine plaintiffs in the case were among thousands of Pan Am flight attendants left unemployed when the airline declared bankruptcy in 1990. At the time, Delta bought most of Pan Am's assets and hired about 1,800 of Pan Am's 2,600 flight attendants.
The plaintiffs had also charged that Delta violated their rights by asking about their age, marital status and disabilities. State human rights law prohibits employers from asking such questions, according to a spokeswoman for the human rights division, Barbara Klar.
But yesterday, in upholding an earlier ruling by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals ruled that there was no proof that those questions had led to the company's decision not to hire the applicants.
Mr. Strauss, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said he feared the ruling would give license to employers to ask invasive questions. "It really erodes the protections afforded by human rights law," Mr. Strauss said.
Mr. Clay, the Delta spokesman, refused to comment on whether the company continues to make such inquiries in screening job applicants.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Is Japan's Rare, Bold Surprise Sufficient to Revive Economy?

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, facing criticism for sticking to a strategy of fiscal austerity while Japan's economy stands on the brink of recession, stunned his critics today with a surprise package of tax cuts and public spending.
But even as he won praise for changing course, questions quickly arose as to whether his measures were bold enough. 
 The package includes two trillion yen in income tax cuts -- $15.75 billion at current exchange rates, roughly the same amount in spending for public works, and 840 billion yen, or $6.6 billion, in tax cuts for corporations, land owners and investors. In all, the Prime Minister has proposed a stimulus package worth around $38 billion.
It was cobbled together in less than 24 hours, after the Japanese stock market failed to react to leaked reports of a much less ambitious economic plan that would have included just reductions in corporate, land and securities-transaction taxes.
Not all of Mr. Hashimoto's critics, or financial analysts, were mollified by the new package, which includes only about $300 in cuts a year for each Japanese family, and may not be immediately translated into a sufficient stimulus to prime the stalled economy. "It was a necessary step, but it's pretty clear Mr. Hashimoto was dragged to it kicking and screaming," said Alexander Kinmont of Morgan Stanley Japan.
The announcement took bureaucrats here by surprise. Mr. Hashimoto returned to Tokyo late Tuesday evening after a meeting with Asian leaders in Malaysia and began waking colleagues with phone calls to brief them on his plans.
Early today, though, the Finance Ministry seemed to scramble as the announcement was made. "I knew about it at 10:30 this morning -- same as you," said Eisuke Sakakibara, the influential vice minister for international affairs. "We are just petty bureaucrats," he said tonight, perhaps only half in jest.
Still, he called the leadership the Prime Minister demonstrated "brilliant," perhaps an indication that his ministry had, after all, been involved in the new plan's preparation.
Bureaucrats from the Finance Ministry polled economists and journalists on Tuesday to get an idea of how certain proposals might be received. That may have led to the additional two trillion yen in public works spending tacked on late this afternoon, apparently in response to analysts' assessments that even a sizable income tax cut, combined with the lowest corporate tax rates since World War II, was not enough to push the economy into a recovery.
Mr. Sakakibara suggested that the package would increase Japan's gross domestic product by at least 1 percent, given that tax cuts usually have an effect beyond their monetary value.
Private economists were less rosy. They estimated that more than half of the income tax cut would find its way into savings accounts, not store cash registers. In 1994, when the Government cut taxes, the savings rate jumped 14 percent after having been flat for the previous three years.
The tax cut announced today is to be for one year only, as Mr. Hashimoto made very clear. And the $300 it would save each taxpayer is to come next June, curtailing any immediate benefit to the economy from increased consumer demand. "It's not enough to create a self-sustaining recovery or send the stock market soaring to new heights," said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
The United States was pleased that Mr. Hashimoto had taken at least some action. The Prime Minister received a call from President Clinton, and Michael D. McCurry, Mr. Clinton's spokesman, praised the measures as a financial package "good for the people of Japan and good for the regional economy of Asia."
Skeptics conceded that any sign of movement on the part of the Government would be greeted with relief.
"It's about 1 percent of gross domestic product, but that's really not the point," said Ronald Bevacqua, a Merrill Lynch economist here. "Given how pessimistic everyone has been, this may actually give people some sense of hope. It's about sentiment as much as anything."
The plans for the two trillion yen in public works, which will be contracted and paid for this year, are likely to be controversial. The Government has come under criticism for spending on unnecessary bridges, tunnels and the like that have kept Japan's bloated construction industry afloat for the last few years.
The Prime Minister succeeded in winning applause from critics for his pluck, and got a somewhat more muted reception for the package itself. "I have to think Hashimoto has been wringing his hands over this one a long time," said John F. Neuffer, a political analyst at the Mitsui Marine Research Institute here. "And his timing was so perfect: he rolls in after the party lackadaisically throws together a package that was sure to be criticized, and steals the show."
In response, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks soared more than 700 points after news of the tax cut got out, and although the index retreated some, it closed the session Wednesday up 3.4 percent. Early Thursday, stocks retreated more, down 245.66 points, or almost 1.5 percent, to 16,295.40 at the midday recess.
The yen, which has slipped substantially against the dollar, rose today as the Japanese central bank moved swiftly, selling dollars and buying yen, to take advantage of the element of surprise.
Mr. Hashimoto came to power promising to overhaul Japan's bureaucracy and to impose fiscal responsibility. His administrative reform plans were taken apart by powerful interest groups, and his adherence to fiscal austerity contributed to a further slowing of the economy.
Last spring, his Government -- demonstrating its seriousness on fiscal restraint -- took back a temporary tax cut, increased the sales tax and eliminated some medical subsidies. The economy, already contending with bad debt and some industry overcapacity, stopped growing.
Still, the Prime Minister stuck to his guns, practicing an ancient Japanese art -- perseverance in the face of extreme adversity.
But in the last month, the economy took a turn for the worse. Four large financial institutions collapsed in November. The yen had its biggest drop in years. Stocks began reaching a level that threatened to bring even more banks to their knees. The United States and the International Monetary Fund politely suggested that while Japan's efforts to get its house in order were admirable, perhaps they were mistimed.
In the last couple of weeks, factions in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party urged Mr. Hashimoto to change his policies. First, Seiroku Kajiyama suggested a huge bond issue, the proceeds of which could be used to spur the economy. Then, earlier this week, even Hiromu Nonaka, deputy secretary general of the party and lieutenant to Koichi Kato, one of the most adamant fiscal hawks, began quietly expressing the view that a change in policy was unavoidable and that further stalling only allowed Mr. Kajiyama, their party antagonist, to steal the thunder.
But stung by charges that he had flip-flopped when he decided to use public money to shore up the financial system, the Prime Minister held steady. Not until a group of young mavericks began suggesting Monday that he could avoid the appearance of going back on his word because the Fiscal Consolidation Law did not go into effect until April did Mr. Hashimoto decide to risk great political trouble by scuttling the commitment to fiscal austerity.
There were signs that for the Prime Minister, the decision had been very difficult. Asked at his news conference this morning whether the Government's fiscal tightening last spring had been a mistake, he replied with irritation, "If you want to say so, please say so."
Nihon Keizei Shimbun, Japan's business daily, reported that when the senior adviser to the Government's tax committee, Sadanori Yamanaka, received Mr. Hashimoto's call and, incredulously, suggested that he must be suffering from jet lag, the Prime Minister snapped back, "No, I am very serious."
Whether Hiroshi Mitsuzuka continues as Finance Minister seemed uncertain. In recent days, he has been mentioned as likely scapegoat for the Government's woes, and his ministry was forced to delay a press briefing this morning because Mr. Hashimoto's announcements took it, too, by surprise.

HEADLINE: Fleeing Abuse to the Streets;
Shelters Can't Keep Pace With Increase in Runaways

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

DATELINE: HARRISON, N.Y., Dec. 17

 BODY:
She will not go home again, the 15-year-old runaway told her caseworker, her guidance counselor and her therapist, in no uncertain terms.
She has yanked her mother from a bar for the last time, the girl said. Undressed her for the last time because she was too drunk to put herself to bed. Taken the last blow from her grandfather. Heard the last of her grandmother's screaming, so loud that even rap music wouldn't drown it out. 
 "I'll go anyplace but home," said the blond, lanky teen-ager, who arrived at a runaway shelter here bruised but smiling, relieved to be at a secret location where her family could not find her. "If I have to keep running, I'll keep running. I've had enough."
The girl's plight is all too common in an overburdened child-welfare system that focuses its limited resources on the infant who might be shaken unconscious or the toddler who might be starved to death by a parent or guardian, advocates and social service officials agree.
An abused or neglected teen-ager does not claim the same sympathy as a chubby-cheeked baby, these experts say. A teen-ager is also harder to place in foster care and is old enough and strong enough to retaliate or run.
But run where, when there are 30,000 teen-agers who have fled their homes in New York State and only 400 emergency shelter beds, 13,000 runaways in New Jersey with safe haven for only 300, and 10,000 in Connecticut with room for just 115? Even if a runaway finds a bed in a crisis center, where does he or she go after reaching the 30-day Federal limit for sanctuary in an emergency shelter, like the one in Harrison?
Here in Westchester County, 1,883 teen-agers were reported missing in 1996, up from 1,534 in 1995. In the same time, county spending for the one emergency shelter decreased by nearly 40 percent, forcing the agency to make up more of its $330,000 budget from private contributions.
Teen-agers here who do not come to the shelter flee to Getty Square in Yonkers. In New York City, they form raggedy bands in the Port Authority terminal or along the West Side piers. In the tattered upstate city of Jamestown, their home of last resort is Veterans Park, across from the high school they long ago stopped attending.
Flight has its risks, advocates for adolescents say, as demonstrated in dire fashion in Jamestown two months ago. The authorities said nearly a dozen young girls, most of them runaways, were infected with H.I.V. by Nushawn J. Williams, a handsome Brooklyn felon who is accused of luring them into drug dealing and unprotected sex with a warm bed, a square meal, cheap trinkets and smooth talk.
"Where else can they go?" asked Margo Hirsch, executive director of the Empire State Coalition for Youth and Family Services, citing the paucity of emergency shelters and the lack of follow-up services. "The streets start looking pretty good. And in the streets we know who's taking care of them: the pimps and the drug dealers. The ultimate outcome is that too many of them die by proxy. No, the parents didn't kill them. But they're dead just the same."
The Federal Government acknowledged the problem two decades ago with the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, which financed a national network of call-in lines and crisis shelters, from the cavernous Covenant House on Manhattan's West Side to YMCA basements in Milwaukee and Minneapolis.
Of the estimated 1.3 million American teen-agers who run away or are kicked out of their homes each year, some due to garden-variety teen-age rebellion or the stress of divorce or unemployment, the vast majority eventually find their way back again. But in the last 15 years, shelter directors, researchers and other experts say, a growing number have been fleeing broken families that are not so easily mended. The problem is usually related to adult drug and alcohol abuse, single parenthood and a parade of men in the house with no emotional stake in the children. These cases often end in violence, experts say, with a disturbed teen-ager on the run.
Warm-weather states have substantially more teen-agers leaving home for longer periods than cold-weather states, said Dr. Gerald T. Hotaling, a researcher at the University of Massachusetts in Lowell who has studied teen-age runaways for 15 years, but no region "sticks out in having a really assertive response."
Here at the Sanctuary shelter caseworkers are scrambling to come up with a plan that will keep the 15-year-old girl off the streets.
Her biography, experts say, is typical. Like most runaways, she is a girl in her early teens, living with a single parent, in a family with several generations of alcohol abuse and domestic violence. She has attempted suicide, has mental health problems and has run away before. She is unlikely to meet the county's requirements for foster placement.
"They see so many more severe cases," said Hans J. Schlange, director of the shelter here. "They have to have cutoff points due to the sheer numbers."
Donald J. Wiede, who runs the child welfare arm of the county's Department of Social Services, concedes a dearth of services and a lower rate of placement for adolescents than for younger children. "There is a gap between the expectations and the reality of what we're able to do in terms of resources," he said.
But the 15-year-old girl, who shudders at every mention that she might have to go home, is not interested in the mismatch between resources and expectations. She has had enough. Fresh from a therapy appointment at a Catholic Charities center one recent afternoon, she was asked what finally persuaded her that home was no longer an option.
"I can't say what caused it," she said. "Everything and nothing. I've been shoving it deep down inside, and then something lit the fuse and it just blew up."
The girl arrived last month at the shelter, run by the Children's Village agency in nearby Dobbs Ferry. Her story was pieced together through her own accounts, observations during a half-dozen long visits at the shelter and conversations with staff members, who filed an abuse complaint with the county when she arrived with bruises all over her body.
The girl's mother and grandparents, who share a two-family house in southern Westchester, were not interviewed at the request of her caseworkers here, her guidance counselor at a religious school where she gets mostly A's and B's and her therapist, all of whom fear for her safety. Because of their concern about family retaliation, she is not identified.
These caseworkers and counselors are barred by law from providing details of the case. But all said that her account was credible. Law enforcement officials confirmed police visits to the house "pertaining to the girl."
The girl, who excels in her English and religion classes and hopes to go to college, has hazy plans, beyond counting the months until she turns 16 and can no longer be forced to return home. "I just have to lay low until then," she said.
She likes the workers here at the shelter, who oohed and ahhed at her report card, pretend not to notice when she goes outside to smoke cigarettes and chose her to put the angel at the top of the Christmas tree.
Maybe she can find another shelter if she has to leave this one, the girl said. Or maybe she can live with her boyfriend, who has been in and out of drug rehabilitation. Her therapist and guidance counselor support her decision not to go home, the girl said. But they are dubious about the 16-year-old boy, whose football jersey she wears every day because it carries his scent.
The girl never knew her father because her mother, a construction worker, fled his abuse during pregnancy. Since then, they have lived with the grandparents, except for a brief, happy time when her mother married. The girl glows when discussing her stepfather, who had a house on an upstate lake, played basketball with her, and took her to see "The Phantom of the Opera" on Broadway. Two years ago, he died of a heroin overdose.
Since then, the girl said, her mother's drinking has escalated. Her grandfather lost a job and he, too, took his sorrows to the neighborhood bar. Both pummeled her when they were drunk and angry, she said, usually after finding her boyfriend in the house. Her grandmother does not drink and did not hit her, but never intervened. Her great-grandmother, who calls the shelter nightly to make sure she is eating well and has enough clothes, lives nearby but is drifting into senility.
At 12 the girl ran away, passing one rainy night in a park, a railroad station and a 24-hour laundromat where she dried her clothes. At 14, she tried to commit suicide by swallowing medicine that her grandfather took for diabetes, heart and liver disease. Her mother was summoned from a bar to tend to her semiconscious daughter, the girl said. The girl was hospitalized and then referred to therapy.
Last semester, she was absent from school twice and tardy only once. "When I'm at school I'm happy," she said. "Then I walk through the door at home and I'm a different person.
The girl bolted again last month when her family found her boyfriend in the house. She spent a few nights at the boy's house, where her relatives caught up with her. At the suggestion of her boyfriend's mother, she came here. The staff members who interviewed her said she demonstrated credibility by noting which bruises were inflicted by relatives and which from a fall.
During her stay here, the 15-year-old was a serene island in the storm. One boy was found to be hiding a box cutter in his room and was moved to a psychiatric hospital. A girl, claiming lost bus fare, was late every night. Neither of her squabbling parents wanted her, and so she was shipped to an uncle in Texas. Another girl, a patient in an outpatient drug rehabilitation program became ill after smoking marijuana for 24 hours, and is likely to be placed elsewhere after a court appearance on an earlier assault charge.
The 15-year-old said the chaos here can be "pretty much like home." The telephones constantly ring with new emergencies, parents threatening legal action if their children are not sent home, despite their right to be here under Federal law. But even with these outbursts and a 90-minute trip to school each day on three buses, the girl begs to stay.
At a family meeting on Tuesday, emboldened by the counseling she has received here, the girl confronted her mother about her drinking and abuse. The mother's nasty response disturbed caseworkers. Perhaps the county will be persuaded to remove the girl from her home. Failing that, Mr. Schlange said he plans to use what is left of her time here to broker a solution to keep her off the streets.
In the meantime, after homework and a cup of hot chocolate, she often retreats to the dining room and the twinkling Christmas tree. "I like it in here because it's quiet," she said.

HEADLINE: Clinton on His Foreign Policy: A Rose-Tinted World

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Although he acknowledged that work remained to be done, President Clinton gave a remarkably upbeat assessment of his Administration's foreign-policy achievements at his news conference on Tuesday, a kind of sneak preview of his 1998 State of the Union Message.
The picture was all but unrecognizable to many in Washington foreign-policy circles, including a number of senior Administration officials. Asked what he made of it, one such official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, rolled his eyes and replied, "The President was just having a little political fun." 
 What puzzled many people about Mr. Clinton's words was not their partisan nature but the breadth of the claims he made at a time when the consensus among Western diplomats based here is that American foreign relations have hit a bad patch. They blame not just Mr. Clinton but the intractability of certain problems and the difficulty of formulating policy in an ambiguous era with severely limited agreement on goals, not only across party lines but also within parties.
After a period of relative success in places like Bosnia, where American diplomacy stanched the blood-letting, and Mexico, where a bold American intervention helped solve a financial crisis, the tide seems to many to have slowly turned. United States relations with Russia and China, a pair of insecure giants, remain relatively stable, if full of unresolved questions. But elsewhere, the picture is not nearly so reassuring, diplomats say.
In Iraq, the United States maintains that it has yielded nothing to Saddam Hussein to ease the latest crisis there; indeed, Mr. Clinton said Tuesday that "we stood strong against a rogue regime in Iraq" and insisted that United States allies were less likely than ever to press for easing sanctions.
Yet in the behind-the-scenes maneuvering only Britain among the members of the Persian Gulf war coalition remains steadfast behind the American position, with France, Russia, Germany and most Arab countries favoring a softening of United Nations penalties. If another confrontation with President Hussein develops, furthermore, it appears likely that any military response will be left by the others to the United States and possibly Britain.
President Clinton has agreed in principle to allowing Iraq to sell more oil so that it can use the revenues to buy food. The President suggested that this had been an American idea from the start; the Europeans say that Mr. Clinton has given way only in the face of strong European pressure.
In a way, the two pictures of the situation in Iraq are reminiscent of the conflicting portrayals of the war in Vietnam in the 1960's, by President Lyndon B. Johnson on the one hand and anti-war campaigners on the other.
There were other striking examples of rose-colored glasses.
Mr. Clinton said that "under the Vice President's leadership" conferees in Kyoto this month had taken "an important step" toward protecting the global environment from the climate-warming gases produced by burning fossil fuels. But Vice President Al Gore spent less than a day in Kyoto, and the United States agreed to a last-minute compromise on "greenhouse" gas emissions that was rendered more or less meaningless when Mr. Clinton made it clear that he would not submit the treaty to the Senate unless developing nations made concessions they had refused to make at the conference.
Again, in the Middle East, even the forceful intervention of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has failed to get peace efforts back on course. Domestic politics in Israel make the necessary concessions difficult to grant, and Arab terrorist attacks strengthen the hand of the hard-liners. Mr. Clinton declined to meet the Israeli President, Benjamin Netanyahu, when he was in the United States recently, an action that many, including Mr. Netanyahu, interpreted as a snub.
The President waved that idea aside with the comment that he had met Mr. Netanyahu five times and would meet with him next year. He said he would never insult Israel or the Israeli people; careful listeners may have noticed that he did not say he would never snub Mr. Netanyahu personally.
On Bosnia, he ducked the question of extending the stay of American troops beyond next year's deadline, apparently because of squabbles on the issue within the Administration. But he said he would state his policy before leaving on a Christmas trip to Bosnia in only three days, and it became evident less than 24 hours after the news conference that he had decided to press for some sort of extension of the American commitment.
Although long accustomed to a Washington policy-making process that is more haphazard than those typical in Europe and Japan, largely because of the divisions of power built into the Constitution, the European and Asian allies of the United States appear bewildered by what is going on now.
"What is the structure? What is the goal?" asked a Western European foreign minister in a conversation this month. "The United States does not seem as deeply engaged as before, and where it is engaged, it seems unsure."
A European diplomat based in Washington commented that even though the United States possessed unmatched military and economic power, neither Congress nor Mr. Clinton seemed clear on exactly how it should be deployed in such places as Iraq and Bosnia. The preference, he said, seemed to be for "second-guessing each other rather than acting."
Mr. Clinton has exhibited great reluctance to commit United States forces abroad, which is not surprising given the Pentagon's considerable skepticism about armed interventions. A case in point has been the attitude of Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, who has only belatedly and reluctantly moved toward accepting the view that American troops should remain in Bosnia after a June 1998 withdrawal deadline.
Ms. Albright has taken a much more aggressive line, pressing within Administration councils and in a major speech at Harvard University for a more activist policy, both diplomatically and militarily. On Bosnia, she appears to be prevailing, but the Administration remains guarded in other areas.
Arguably, the expansion of free trade -- and its corollary, the expansion of the number of market-economy democracies -- has been the most consistent theme in American policy in the last decade.
Among Mr. Clinton's notable successes were the negotiation and approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement and American approval of the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He had hoped to build on those successes in his second term, but he was handed a bitter defeat by Congress when he sought added authority to conclude future deals.
In some senses, Congress has been the largest impediment to the development of a coherent foreign policy in the period following the cold war, where there is no organizing principle comparable to the long struggle to stem Communist expansion. A majority of House members and 40 percent of the Senators have been elected since the fall of the Berlin wall. A third of all members of Congress are said to lack passports.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Yen Rises On Hope for Japan Growth

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The yen soared yesterday, knocking the value of the dollar down 2.8 percent after Japanese officials surprised the currency markets with a one-two punch.
First, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto included an unexpected, one-time $15 billion income tax cut in an economic-stimulus package. 
 Then, the Japanese central bank sold dollars to buy yen in the market to emphasize the Government's support of the beleaguered currency. It was the first time that the bank had intervened to support the value of the yen in more than five years. Last year, it intervened to weaken the yen -- which suggests how quickly the tables have turned.
The surprise moves sent currency traders scrambling. The dollar has been treated as a one-way bet upward against the yen since the end of October, when Asian financial turmoil intensified. It has risen more than 8 percent in the last month and a half, to five-and-a-half-year highs.
The announcement in Tokyo also helped send United States bond prices lower as investors concluded that an improvement in the outlook for Japan would mean that fewer foreigners would need Treasury securities as a haven.
But beyond scrambling, some traders and strategists were not sure that all that much had changed. While the surprise move could limit further gains for the dollar temporarily, these people look into next year and see the dollar moving higher again.
If that is the case, then a stronger dollar against the yen, and the German mark, could eat into corporate-earnings expectations for 1998 by making American exports less competitive abroad and reducing foreign earnings when the export revenue is translated back into dollars.
The dollar is already up almost 10 percent against the yen and 15 percent against the mark in the last year, which has helped cut Merrill Lynch's earnings forecast for next year to single digits.
The longer-term outlook of further dollar gains helped explain the currency's partial rebound in trading in the United States yesterday. A trader at a prominent hedge fund, which often takes big currency positions, said there would be some "short-term pain." But the decline, the trader added, was seen more as an opportunity to take on bigger positions rather than a setback because the outlook was for a stronger dollar.
Late in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 127.08 yen, down from 130.78 yen on Tuesday. In Japanese trading earlier, the dollar fell as low as 125.78 yen. This morning, the dollar rose in spot trading to 127.35 yen.
Against the mark yesterday, the dollar traded in New York at 1.7735, down from 1.7822 marks on Tuesday.
Karen E. Parker, a currency strategist at the Chase Manhattan Bank, acknowledged that the Japanese had altered the near-term outlook for the yen. She adjusted her year-end forecast for the dollar down to 128 yen from 130.
"The package definitely goes in the right direction," she said, adding that "we should be watching much more closely to see if this is a harbinger of change" of the tight fiscal policies that have helped restrain the Japanese economy in the 1990's. The decision to support an income tax cut was a reversal of Mr. Hashimoto's previously strong opposition.
The prodding of the Japanese to take such steps by President Clinton also prompted traders to ask if "there is more to come, and whether the United States will intervene in the market" to support the yen. Many of them consider that unlikely and wonder how much the Japanese central bank can achieve alone.
Barbara Levchuk, head of foreign exchange sales at HSBC Midland, said all these factors were putting a hold right now on the dollar. "I thought it was a smart move on the part of the Japanese," she said. "I would sit back and not be too aggressive in buying dollars. Maybe we have put a top on the dollar-yen for now."
In the long run, many currency strategists and traders expect the dollar to move higher because the Japanese economy may not get that much of a lift from the stimulus package. The income tax cut, they note, was proposed as temporary, and a lot of the money can be expected to be saved rather than spent.
In addition, many Japanese investors are looking for better returns from the money they have built up, and the United States is a much more attractive place than Japan to do that. This means that more yen would be sold to get the dollars to buy American stocks and bonds.
"They can't lean against the wind indefinitely," Ms. Parker of Chase Manhattan said. "The fundamentals are not supporting a stronger yen." Her end-of-1998 forecast is for an exchange rate of 140 yen to the dollar, a 10 percent jump from where the dollar ended yesterday.
Carl Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said that "in the first half of 1998, the dollar is going to be a real strong currency because the U.S. is the one place that works with certainty."
"Where else do you want to put your money?" he added.

HEADLINE: CLINTON TO EXTEND G.I. ROLE IN BOSNIA

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
President Clinton has decided that American troops should stay in Bosnia past their mission's current departure deadline in June as part of an international peacekeeping force, Administration officials said today.
Mr. Clinton, who is planning to visit troops stationed in Bosnia next week, is expected to announce at the White House on Thursday that he has decided "in principle" to extend the mission. About 8,000 Americans are serving in Bosnia, as part of a NATO-led force of more than 30,000. 
 Administration officials said Mr. Clinton was not going to announce the number of troops that will remain, when they might leave or even how the mission might change, since those details are under review in NATO. It is that review, together with the President's coming holiday visit to the troops, that prompted his long-expected decision to extend the mission, officials said.
"None of this planning will ever be real or taken seriously by the Euros unless the U.S. is in," an Administration official said, referring to other members of NATO. "We are the glue that has held this thing together."
Alliance planners are expected to lay out their specific military options in Bosnia by mid-January or soon after. Military officials are looking at a range of options for the American component of the peacekeeping force, including keeping 8,000 American troops in Bosnia, an Administration official said. More likely, other officials have indicated, the force will shrink, perhaps to 6,000.
This will be Mr. Clinton's second extension of a mission that has been controversial since he first ordered ground troops into Bosnia to carry out peace accords negotiated in Dayton in 1995. Mr. Clinton originally said the troops would be there for only one year, through the end of 1996. But days after the Presidential election last year, he said the troops would stay through June 1998.
No American troops have fallen to hostile fire during the Bosnian mission. Despite criticism that key provisions of the Dayton accords -- most notably the repatriation of refugees and the arrest of accused war criminals -- have not been carried out, the international force has successfully secured a fragile peace.
Congressional critics of the Administration's Bosnia policy never believed that a definite "date certain" for the withdrawal was real. "I certainly hope that they don't insult our intelligence again with another date certain," Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, said today. "I never believed that a date certain was a substitute for an exit strategy."
Mr. McCain said Congress might permit the extension, since its only option is the unappealing one of cutting off money to the troops. But, he said, the Administration's "credibility in my view has been terribly damaged" by officials' testimony that the force would leave by July.
Administration officials said they had learned lessons from the long mission in Bosnia. This time, they said, they are not waiting until the last minute, but seeking support for an extension seven months before the current mission expires.
"The President wanted us to engage early on this," another Administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "This is being done in a deliberate way that is not at all hasty."
For weeks, the Administration has signaled that American troops would remain in Bosnia past June. After the President met in early November with Congressional critics of his Bosnia policy, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said "a consensus is developing" between the Administration and Congress that the troops would stay.
Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, who had declared in March that the United States would withdraw the troops as promised, has only recently come around to supporting an extension. But he, too, has been seeking Congressional support for the Administration's policy. Today, he telephoned Democrats and Republicans in Congress seeking their backing.
The President has invited Congressional leaders to travel with him to Bosnia on Sunday. He plans to give speeches in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and in Tuzla, the headquarters of American forces, and to greet troops at an air base, returning home without spending a night in Bosnia.
An Administration official said Mr. Clinton had decided to announce the extension of the deadline before leaving for Bosnia, in part because the troops there "are entitled to have a general sense of the direction of U.S. policy."
Two prominent Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John W. Warner of Virginia and and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, sent a letter to Mr. Clinton today advising him on his trip and saying, "We understand that you plan to announce that continued U.S. participation is necessary."
They wrote that before extending the mission, Mr. Clinton and NATO should address several issues, including finding a way to bring more war-crimes suspects to justice. And, they said, "the European allies must do more in the overall effort -- especially in providing for a more effective police force" to enforce the law.
The Administration has been trying to persuade its NATO allies to give more support to an international police force that would take on more responsibilities of the peacekeepers.
Administration officials said they were working with the NATO planners to define more clearly the American mission in any extended military presence. In that vein, Mr. Clinton is expected to list on Thursday a series of questions he wants answered by the NATO planners, including how the mission will eventually end without inviting a resumption of violence among the Croats, Muslims and Serbs in Bosnia.
But even in the Administration, officials still disagree over the proper size and mission of the American force. "There are some who want to move to a smaller force, for a variety of reasons, whether political or economic or because they want to put pressure on the Europeans to pick up more," an official said.

HEADLINE: South Koreans Vote, Seeking Rescue From Economic Crisis

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Thursday, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Voters began casting their ballots this morning for a new President to rescue this nation from its financial crisis and preside over a far-reaching industrial overhaul during the next five years.
As the candidates finished their campaigning on Wednesday night, bellowing in hoarse voices to shoppers in the markets, the election came to be widely seen as a milestone in Korean history. 
 It is a bit like the American Presidential election of 1932, during the Great Depression, and each candidate is trying to portray himself as a reassuring Roosevelt-like figure able to lead the country to economic recovery.
The two leading candidates, Kim Dae Jung (pronounced kim-day-joong) and Lee Hoi Chang (pronounced ee-hweh-chahng), were neck and neck in opinion polls, but they come from very different backgrounds. Mr. Lee is a former judge and the epitome of the establishment, while Mr. Kim is a legendary democracy campaigner in Asia whom past South Korean Presidents repeatedly tried to kill.
If Mr. Kim wins, it will be the first peaceful transfer of the presidency to the opposition party in modern Korean history. Just 10 years ago, when Mr. Kim was also running, the country was rife with rumors that his victory would provoke a military coup. Now there are no such rumblings.
In any case, this will probably be the closest and most democratic election Korea has ever had, and the dominant issue is simply who will be able to resolve the national crisis and restore South Korea to greatness.
"I ran three times before in presidential elections, and this is surely my last chance," Mr. Kim declared as campaigning ended on Wednesday. "I thank the public for reserving me until today, when the nation truly needs a strong and capable leader."
Mr. Kim also warned that if Mr. Lee was elected, "the nation will plunge into deeper crisis."
Mr. Lee responded by suggesting that the financial markets would effectively punish Korea if it chose Mr. Kim. "If a figure lacking credibility with the international community takes office, there would be a further exodus of our meager foreign capital," Mr. Lee declared, referring to Mr. Kim.
Both Mr. Lee and Mr. Kim have lived in the United States and speak fairly good English, and each portrays himself as the international candidate with the ties to Washington that can help resolve the crisis.
Both candidates now say they favor far-reaching economic changes in accordance with the International Monetary Fund's bailout of South Korea.
Financial analysts said that the stock market would probably react better to a win by Mr. Lee, as he is regarded as more of a pro-business candidate, while Mr. Kim is seen as a populist who might be reluctant to close bankrupt companies and put people out of work.
On the other hand, Mr. Kim has far more credibility with labor unions, and with the poor and disenfranchised. If Mr. Kim backs a far-reaching restructuring program, he may be able to do it more easily than anyone else.
Mr. Lee is gambling that voters will be angry at the governing party but fearful of turning to the untested opposition at a moment of crisis, and he has spoken under the banner of "stability against turmoil."
"Since the economy is experiencing difficulties and the country is unstable, the entire nation must be led by a responsible and stable political force," Mr. Lee declared on Wednesday.
Mr. Kim is hoping that the public will be so disgusted by the Government's mishandling of the crisis that it will punish Mr. Lee and the governing party, and he tells voters, "the country needs a shift of power."
Traditionally, South Korea has been fiercely divided by regional rivalries that go back many centuries but have been exacerbated in recent decades. Mr. Kim is the hero of the Cholla provinces in the southwest, and he normally gets almost all of the votes there but few in the rest of the country, particularly the southeast.
Those rivalries are still evident in this election, but they may have subsided a bit. There is no candidate from the southeast this time, for Mr. Lee was born in what is now North Korea.
In addition, Mr. Lee made a campaign swing to Kwangju, in the heart of Cholla, as a show of broad-mindedness. During his two-hour visit, he was heavily protected by riot-equipped policemen and by guards sent by Mr. Kim's supporters, who feared that any clashes could be used against their candidate. In the end, the visit went smoothly.
"A national leader should not neglect any city or province," Mr. Lee thundered in his speech in Kwangju, which chafes at the neglect it has suffered from the Government for several decades.
The campaign has also been remarkable for its historical ironies. In a tribute to pragmatism or opportunism, depending on one's analysis, Mr. Kim has allied himself with an erstwhile rival who symbolizes the military dictatorship that tried to kill Mr. Kim in the 1970's.
He has struck a deal with Kim Jong Pil, who has strong support in the southeast but was the founder of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency and was a top adviser to President Park Chung Hee in the 1960's and 1970's.
President Park's Government tried to murder Kim Dae Jung several times, and the K.C.I.A. once kidnapped him while he was visiting Tokyo, apparently with the idea of drowning him in the ocean. Western governments intervened, and Kim Dae Jung's life was spared.
Under the agreement between the two men, Kim Dae Jung would become President initially, but South Korea could then move to a parliamentary system headed by Kim Jong Pil.

Clinton's Personal Touch in Asian Rescue

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
As Asia's financial crisis has deepened, President Clinton has become personally involved in the effort to persuade Asian leaders to follow American-designed plans to stabilize their economies. In a blitz of phone calls, he has underscored the risks of much broader trouble for the world economy if Japan and South Korea in particular fail to act, American and Asian officials say.
On Thanksgiving evening, for example, Mr. Clinton called Kim Young Sam, South Korea's lame-duck President, to make the case that time had run out on negotiations over the terms of a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. In the days leading up to the call, South Korea's banking system seemed just days away from insolvency, and the President's economic advisers feared that failures in the world's 11th-largest economy could resonate in Japan and around the globe. 
 After several more efforts to ease the terms demanded by the I.M.F., Mr. Kim's Government reluctantly agreed six days after the South Korean leader spoke with Mr. Clinton. But one South Korean official said that some in the Government had "resented the use of Presidential pressure," especially because they believed -- largely accurately -- that some of the toughest elements of the economic prescription were being drafted by Mr. Clinton's Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin.
Last Friday, Mr. Kim called back to announce that he had persuaded all three candidates in the South Korean presidential election, which is on Thursday, to endorse the I.M.F. bailout plan. But he also used the conversation to ask obliquely for faster financial aid from the United States and Japan -- a request that the Korean press reported was accepted and that American officials say was rejected.
The intervention by Mr. Clinton with Mr. Kim and with Japan's Prime Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto carries some political risks.
It is far from clear that this approach to economic restoration will succeed. And even if it does, Mr. Clinton's intercession could allow South Korean labor unions, laid-off workers in Thailand and Japanese politicians to blame the United States for the pain they are enduring.
A growing number of critics in the United States and across Asia argue that the I.M.F. is not only acting at Washington's bidding but that it is protecting foreign investors, including many American banks and businesses, that made foolish investments in Asia. Some argue that the prescriptions the I.M.F. is enforcing in South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia will squeeze the growth out of those countries, touch off unemployment and risk social unrest.
At the Treasury, officials are going to great lengths to make a time of crisis seem like a time of calm, and Mr. Rubin occasionally acknowledges a tinge of self-doubt about parts of the rescue effort.
Mr. Rubin has, for example, often talked of the "moral hazard" created by bailout plans that effectively reduce the risks faced by investors in poorly run economies. If investors become convinced that the I.M.F. always stands ready to forestall default, Mr. Rubin has said, then they will not demand that national leaders enforce economic discipline. He has often repeated that he would like to figure out a way to save countries without also saving those who have invested in them.
"But you have to remember that the crux of our concern is America's interests," he said in an interview on Tuesday. "Our economy can certainly be affected if a sufficient number of emerging nations" head into a prolonged crisis.
And these days, Mr. Rubin is more apt to make use of the leading noneconomic argument in favor of interjecting the President.
"We are convinced that economic stability is important to our national security concerns," especially in Korea, one of the last surviving arenas of cold war conflict, the Treasury Secretary has argued.
The President's phone call to Mr. Kim on Thanksgiving was not disclosed by the White House, in itself a telling sign.
While the Administration has been eager to announce meeting after meeting about the Iraq crisis, in hopes that the attention will frighten Saddam Hussein, it has been loath to reveal Presidential involvement in the Asian financial crisis.
"The worry," one White House official said today, "is that the mere announcement that the President was meeting his advisers about Asia would drive the markets crazy, and that's exactly what we are trying to avoid."
But both American and Asian officials say that Mr. Clinton has increasingly been swept in. In late October, when Indonesia suddenly called for an I.M.F. bailout, he began receiving a daily, one-page report on the Asian crisis, usually sent to the White House by Mr. Rubin or his deputy, Lawrence H. Summers. He was immersed in the issue at a meeting of Asian leaders last month in Vancouver, British Columbia.
But his role expanded as South Korea began to falter, and Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers argued that failure to stop the Asian panic in Korea could threaten Japanese banks and, eventually, hit American shores.
Mr. Clinton has had a rocky relationship with Mr. Kim, especially in the 1994 crisis involving North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons capability. But in this instance, Mr. Clinton has the advantage because the United States holds tremendous sway over the I.M.F. and could block any bailout package. In fact, the negotiations dragged on for several days because participants were not satisfied with South Korea's commitments to close failing financial institutions. A $57 billion package was announced on Dec. 4.
With Japan, Mr. Clinton has had far less influence. He and Mr. Rubin have argued in phone conversations and meetings with Prime Minister Hashimoto in recent months that Japan needed to stimulate domestic demand, chiefly with a tax cut that would undo the damage done by a tax increase in April. Mr. Hashimoto resisted, saying that Japan's economy was on the way to recovery. At the Vancouver conference, the Japanese Prime Minister changed his position, saying he had been too optimistic. Mr. Clinton raised the pressure, declaring that it was Japan's responsibility to lead Asia out of its troubles.
"It is hard to say how much Hashimoto was influenced by Clinton," a Japanese diplomat said this week. The Finance Ministry had opposed a deep tax cut to stimulate the economy, fearing it would worsen Japan's budget deficit. But Mr. Hashimoto was also under increasing pressure from his Liberal Democratic Party to act decisively after months of promising big steps and delivering small, unsuccessful ones.
"He might have gotten there without Clinton because the markets were pushing him to act," one Japanese official said today. "But the American shove was convenient," one Japanese official said. "It's always safe to declare, 'Washington made us do it.' "

Weak Earnings Hurt Stocks As Asia News Is Ignored
Stocks in the United States ended mostly lower for the first time this week, hurt by unexpected weakness in quarterly earnings that offset strength from rallies in Asia after Japan's Government proposed a large tax cut.
The catalyst for the Wall Street decline was news from Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing that fourth-quarter earnings would be more than 10 percent below estimates. Its stock fell nearly 10 percent and helped send the Dow Jones industrial average down 18.90 points, to 7.957.41, snapping a two-day rally. Most broader market barometers also ended lower. Pages D12 and D4. 

Bonds fell, hurt by a big drop in the dollar against the yen, which pushed the yield on the 30-year bond back up to 6 percent, from 5.96 percent on Tuesday. D23.
 
Gold, platinum and palladium surged on the news of a possible income tax reduction in Japan, one of the biggest industrial users of precious metals. D10.
 
Internal Rift Threatens Andersen
A feud between the accountants and consultants at Andersen Worldwide threatened to lead to a split-up of the huge firm, as the consultants said they would seek an arbitrator as part of an effort to leave. The 1,100 partners of Andersen Consulting say their counterparts at Arthur Andersen have broken a 1989 operating agreement. D2.
 
Seoul Shelves Bank Rescues
South Korea postponed plans to inject money into six of its biggest banks. The delay satisfied a demand of the International Monetary Fund, which wants Seoul to end its practice of propping up banks that made bad lending decisions. The I.M.F. was to meet today to decide whether to release the second installment of a $57 billion rescue package for the country. D9.
 
President Clinton has become personally involved in the effort to persuade Asian leaders to heed American-designed plans to stabilize their economies, telephoning them repeatedly in recent weeks. D8.
 
While its financial markets have regained some lost ground, South Korea is still facing a number of difficult economic choices.

Many Disguises at Columbia/HCA
Columbia/HCA Healthcare repeatedly distorted expense claims to increase Federal reimbursement, according to court records that cut to the heart of a Federal investigation into the world's largest health care company. The distortions included inflated tax claims and illegal tax deductions. A1.
 
Investor Settles Libel Suit
The Wall Street investor Julian H. Robertson withdrew a libel suit against Business Week after it acknowledged there was an inaccuracy in predictions in an April 1996 article regarding the investment performance of Mr. Robertson's Tiger Management. The magazine had said Mr. Robertson's "glory days are over" after he chalked up lackluster results in 1994 and 1995.

Critical-Delivery Loans From the I.M.F.

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund's executive board adopted a short-term loan program today that will rush funds to countries facing immediate debt-repayment problems or low foreign-currency reserves.
The lending mechanism could be used to expedite delivery of a second installment to South Korea worth $3.6 billion -- part of a $21 billion line of credit established for the country -- if the I.M.F. approves of the progress that Seoul has made since agreeing to a rescue package Dec. 3. The fund's executive board is scheduled to review the South Korean situation on Thursday. 
 To determine how much assistance a country needs, the I.M.F. will examine that country's ability to repay, the strength of its economic reform program and the amount already borrowed, the agency said in a statement.
It will also examine the country's "record in using I.M.F. resources in the past and cooperation with the I.M.F. in surveillance, as well as the I.M.F.'s liquidity," the statement said.
Today's action represented a new way to disburse some of the fund's $200 billion in assets and does not represent an increase in money from the United States or other members.
The loan will last for approximately a year, through at least two payments. Borrowers will have to repay the loans within a year to a year and a half from the date the money was given, the agency said.
The new loan program also could be used to accelerate I.M.F. aid to Thailand and Indonesia, which have been suffering from an inability to repay or extend short-term debt and have low foreign-currency reserves.
The Thais and the Indonesians, which were the first two victims of the financial crisis now gripping South Korea, entered into agreements with the I.M.F. to reform their financial systems earlier this year. In exchange, the fund granted Thailand a $3.9 billion line of credit and Indonesia a $10 billion line of credit.

Shortsighted Solution

 BODY:

To the Editor:
As a grant maker to community-based projects, several of which are church based, I find the call by religious groups urging Federal financing for churches as a response to welfare reform naive and shortsighted (news article, Dec. 14). 
 The needs of welfare recipients cannot be adequately addressed by churches unless those churches help provide child care, health care, job training and the counseling so many need to enter the work force. Additionally, the burden of these responsibilities should be picked up by all churches, not just those starved for resources in the inner city. Corporations, foundations and the affluent must also focus resources on the problems of poverty in our country.
Finally, the prospect of finances for churches beleaguered by the fallout from welfare reform may lead to shortsighted policies. Politicians eager to devolve responsibility for complex problems may hand off the task of addressing social and economic poverty to religious organizations, however ill prepared those institutions are. For the churches, the race to the Federal coffers may come at a very high price indeed.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW;
An Asia Sublimely Mixed: Ugly, Lovely, New, Old

BYLINE: By MARGARETT LOKE 

 BODY:
The Magnum photographer Hiroji Kubota doesn't shy away from ambitious projects. For his 1985 book of photographs on China, he crisscrossed that country from late 1978 through early 1984. For a 1992 book commemorating the 500th anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the Americas, he bought an American camper and spent 700 days traveling throughout the United States. For "Out of the East," to be published next spring by W.W. Norton, he spent the last four years photographing in 16 Pacific Rim countries and territories.
A sampling of 95 color photographs, out of the thousands Mr. Kubota took for the Pacific Rim project, is now on exhibit at the Equitable Gallery. And like his earlier transcontinental efforts, this exhibition bears the mark of a superb photographer with an eye for dramatic contrasts as well as for the quietly sublime. 
 Borrowing installation ideas from the 1955 "Family of Man" exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan and from Paul Rudolph of the Bauhaus, the designers of the Kubota exhibition -- Craig Konyk, an architect, and Anthony McCall, a graphic designer -- have created 16 "rooms" in the Equitable Gallery space. The frameless pictures are clustered according to country and held in place at varying heights and angles by wires going from picture to ceiling and from picture to floor. Lengthy captions, accompanied by thumbnail images, are grouped on nearby walls.
Born in 1939 in Tokyo, Mr. Kubota saw his share of death and suffering while growing up in a war-ravaged country. He has said that he is a photographer, not a photojournalist, and that he leaves the coverage of war and mayhem, corruption and repression to others. "Out of the East," therefore, is a vision of Pacific Rim Asia that is both timeless, with its images of gorgeous landscapes and the pervasive influence of Buddhism, and ever-changing, showing the influence of Western architecture and popular culture and Western-style economic development.
When Mr. Kubota visited Pacific Rim Asia in recent years, he was struck by its dynamism. He brilliantly catches the region's vitality in a photograph of youthful motorcycle contestants and observers at the Macau Gran Prix. This is not just an image of vibrant youth but one where the confident, brash postures of the young men and a young woman bespeak a generation that flouts the old stereotypes of quiet, studious, unathletic Asian youth.
A dark side of the Asian miracle-now-mess has been the brutality of governments as they dash headlong down the road of economic development. In a sad but wondrous image, Mr. Kubota shows sand taken from the Irrawaddy River in Myanmar (formerly Burma) to make concrete that would be used to widen a road parallel to the moat around Mandalay Castle. With the widening, people who used to live there were displaced. But in the photograph, peaked mounds of the sand dot a seemingly alien but dreamy landscape, while workers gracefully make their way between the mounds.
The show's most arresting image is not of stunning economic change but of a huge rock, revered by Buddhists and covered in gold leaf, that perches on the edge of a high mountain in Myanmar. Mr. Kubota shows the sheer magic and power of the rock by cropping off its top. This golden precarious wonder sits dead center against a deep blue sky, its imposing size contrasted with six (small by comparison) crimson-robed priests kneeling to one side of it and the low dark hills below.
Scenic spots, though, are occasionally problematic for Mr. Kubota, who produces postcard-pretty images of terraced hillsides in Bali and golden water and shadowy mountains in Luang Prabang, the old capital of Laos. But that chestnut of a picture -- the out-of-a-Chinese-painting mountains of Guilin in Guangxi Province -- is freed from the curse of too familiar loveliness by being paired with the hellish scene of purplish white smoke emanating from black steel mills in Anshan, Liaoning Province.
When Mr. Kubota dabbles in photo reportage, some of the results are, unfortunately, predictable travel pictures. Countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand seem to blur into one another. They have Western skyscrapers, Western leisure pursuits (tennis, swimming) and their variants of the picturesque tribe or ethnic group. Fewer countries and more pictures of each country might have been preferable.
Even when Mr. Kubota photographs a young man standing on one leg on a Phnom Penh street, his other leg having been blown off by a land mine, the image is oddly bloodless. It's as if Mr. Kubota were dutifully taking a representative picture of a victim of land mines instead of coming up with an image that would make the viewer look with fresh eyes at an old scourge.
But where Mr. Kubota is a photographer rather than a recorder of places and peoples, the pictures are mesmerizing. In Guangzhou (formerly Canton), Mr. Kubota happens on card players at two tables beside a high white wall. This would have been an ordinary street scene were it not for beautiful details like the ancient gnarled tree trunks between the tables, their sculptural forms casting impressionistic shadows on the wall.
Like his good friend Andre Kertesz, Mr. Kubota is fond of the surreal. Hong Kong has been famous for airplanes flying low over residential areas, and Mr. Kubota pays tribute to that by showing an airplane looming theatrically in a bit of blue sky between crowded buildings.
In Taiwan's third largest city, Taichung, Mr. Kubota espies the head and shoulders of a huge potbellied Hotei, one of the seven deities of fortune, seemingly plunked down in the middle of palm and pine trees, a skyscraper in the background. A lushly green patch of land in Mindinao, in the Philippines, is crowded with mysterious, small peaked huts, while a man stands, holding a white bird; this is a farm that breeds fighting cocks, according to the caption.
From the show, it seems that Mr. Kubota took some of his best pictures in Vietnam and Cambodia. Among them is a sublime portrait of a Buddhist priest and a young boy in the old Vietnamese city of Hue. Dressed in black and in a room cast in deep shadow, the priest looks gently into the distance while behind him stands a child, a pencil (perhaps) in one hand, the fragile innocence of the very young on his face.
The show's most extraordinary image is taken in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. In a delicately layered picture that brings to mind those taken by Henri Cartier-Bresson, a good friend who has had an influence on his work, Mr. Kubota juxtaposes life and death. On the lower left side of the image are three children playing near the trunk of a big tree, one boy near an old-fashioned Coca-Cola stand emblazoned with the company logo. Dominating the picture is the tree, which is hung with intriguing bottle-shaped woven baskets; they are to protect the fruits from damage. But to the right of the image, through the open window of a well-kept building with intricate architectural detailing on the outside, are shelves and shelves of human skulls.

A Spectacle As Sweeping As the Sea

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN 

 BODY:
The long-awaited advent of the most expensive movie ever made, the reportedly $200 million "Titanic," brings history to mind, and not just the legendary seafaring disaster of April 15, 1912. Think back also, exactly 58 years ago today, to the Dec. 19 New York premiere of another grand, transporting love story set against a backdrop of prideful excess, cataclysmic upheaval and character-defining trial by fire.
Recall how that cultural landmark wowed audiences with its bravado, mad extravagance and state-of-the-art Hollywood showmanship, all fueled by one unstoppable filmmaker and his obsessive imagination. Just as David O. Selznick had Atlanta to burn, now James Cameron has a ship to sink, but he also has much more than calamity to explore in this gloriously retrograde new epic. Mr. Cameron's magnificent "Titanic" is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to "Gone With the Wind." 
 What a rarity that makes it in today's world of meaningless gimmicks and short attention spans: a huge, thrilling three-and-a-quarter-hour experience that unerringly lures viewers into the beauty and heartbreak of its lost world. Astonishing technological advances are at work here, but only in the service of one spectacular illusion: that the ship is afloat again, and that the audience is intimately involved in its voyage.
What's more, Mr. Cameron succeeds magically in linking his film's young lovers, played enchantingly by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, with established details of the "Titanic" story. And let's not forget the offscreen drama: delayed release and outrageous costs made "Titanic" the joke of the summer. Now it's the movie of the year.
Though the tender moments in Mr. Cameron's earlier films have mostly involved Arnold Schwarzenegger, graceful storytelling from this one-man army of a filmmaker (a director, a producer, a writer and an editor) is the biggest of many surprises here. Swept away by the romance of his subject matter, Mr. Cameron rises to the occasion with a simple, captivating narrative style, one that cares little for subtlety but overflows with wonderful, well-chosen Hollywood hokum. In its own sobering way, the film is forward-looking, too, as its early brashness gives way to near-religious humility when the moments of reckoning arrive. Ultimately a haunting tale of human nature, with endless displays of callousness, gallantry or cowardice, it offers an unforgettable vision of millennium-ready unease in the sight of passengers adrift in icy seas on that last, moonless night.
That Mr. Cameron allowed flashlights into what should have been a pitch-black sequence is one of the rare times when "Titanic" willingly departs from established fact. Otherwise, with an attention to detail that goes well beyond fanatical, the film flawlessly recreates its monument to Gilded Age excess. Behind-the-scenes details here, which prove no less fascinating than Selznick's "Gone With the Wind" memos, include Mr. Cameron's having persuaded the original carpet manufacturer to make an 18,000-square-foot reproduction of its "Titanic" weave and his having insisted that every sign, uniform and logo for the Southampton sailing sequence also be created in mirror image, so that the camera could reverse the apparent direction of the nearly life-size model ship.
Sets match old photographs right down to the sculpture and woodwork; costumes incorporate fragments of vintage clothing; even the silver White Star Line ashtrays had to be right. A core group of 150 extras worked with an Edwardian etiquette coach throughout the filming, furthering the illusion that the privileged past had returned to life.
"Titanic" is no museum piece, however. It's a film with tremendous momentum right from its deceptive, crass-looking start. The story opens in the present day, with a team of scientist-cowboys (led by Bill Paxton) hunting for lost treasure amid the Titanic wreckage. Though Mr. Cameron made his own journey to the ocean floor to film amazing glimpses of the ship, he treats these explorers as glib 90's hotshots, the kind of macho daredevils who could just as easily be found tracking twisters or dinosaurs in a summer action film.
"Oops, somebody left the water running," one of them wisecracks about the sunken ship.
Then the film begins, ever so teasingly, to open its window to the past. A 101-year-old woman (played spiritedly by Gloria Stuart, an 87-year-old beauty who appeared in "Gold Diggers of 1935") hears of the expedition and says it has links to her own history. It seems that she, Rose, was the model for a nude sketch found by the present-day fortune hunters in a Titanic safe. It is the only thing of value to be retrieved there. The money in the safe has turned to mud.
But where is the Heart of the Ocean, the egg-size blue diamond Rose wears in the drawing? Rose begins telling her story, and at long last 1912 is at hand. In an introductory sequence mounted on a colossal scale, Mr. Cameron shows the ship being boarded by its full economic range of passengers, from the haughty rich to the third-class passengers being checked for head lice.
Young Rose (Ms. Winslet) arrives at the dock in the show-stopping plumage of Deborah L. Scott's costume designs, and in the unfortunate company of Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), the tiresome snob whom she has agreed to marry, largely at the urging of her impecunious mother (Frances Fisher). The Rose-Cal story line, which is the weakest part of the film thanks to Cal's unwavering odiousness, plays like Edith Wharton Lite.
Meanwhile, in a nearby tavern, adorable Jack Dawson (Mr. DiCaprio) is winning a third-class Titanic ticket in a poker game. It won't be long before Jack is bounding happily into steerage, showing off the boyish adventurousness that makes him such a cure for what's ailing Rose. Aboard the ship of dreams, as the Titanic is often called here, Jack is one serious dreamboat.
A bohemian artist (whose drawings were done by Mr. Cameron) who has spent the requisite time in Paris, he offers all the fun and flirtatiousness that Rose has been missing. This 20-year-old has also shown his share of worldly wisdom by the end of the story. It goes without saying that it's Jack, not Cal, who is the film's true gentleman. And that Mr. DiCaprio has made an inspired career move in so successfully meeting the biggest challenge for an actor of his generation: a traditional role.
Among the many miracles of "Titanic" is its way of creating a sweet, life-changing courtship between Jack and Rose in the course of only a few days. At the risk of turning into a women's picture, "Titanic" brings these two together through a dramatic meeting, an invitation for Jack at a formal first-class dinner, a dancing romp among steerage passengers and even enough intimate moments to give the love story heat. Splendid chemistry between the stars, along with much color from the supporting cast and careful foreshadowing from Mr. Cameron, keeps the romance buoyant even after the dread iceberg gets in its way.
Comfortable even in suggesting that the ship's lookouts missed the danger because they were busy watching lovestruck Jack and Rose, Mr. Cameron lets tragedy strike midway through the film. That way, the disaster can unfold in almost real time, with terrifying precision on a par with all the other details here.
Not for "Titanic" the shrill hysteria of ordinary disaster stories; this film is especially delicate in its slow way of letting the gravity of the situation become clear. Much scarier than any explosion-filled caper film is the simple assessment from the ship's master builder, played with great dignity by Victor Garber: "In an hour or so, all this will be at the bottom of the Atlantic."
As Mr. Cameron joked during production, about a film that pitilessly observes the different plights of the rich and the poor, "We're holding just short of Marxist dogma." (A lavish "Titanic" coffee table book from HarperCollins is filled with fascinating data about the film, from the director's casual asides to accounts of the technological wizardry, like computerized hydraulics, that were devised for repeatedly sinking the ship.) By this point, the audience knows the ship so fully, from Cal and Rose's elaborate suite to the depths of the boiler room, that the film is on shockingly familiar territory as Rose searches every newly waterlogged area for Jack.
Very much to Mr. Cameron's credit is the lack of logistical confusion. Indeed, the film's modern-day characters even watch a computerized version of how the ship split and then rose vertically just before it plunged straight down, events that are later re-enacted with awesome power. Despite all this advance information and the revelation that Rose lives to be 101, "Titanic" still sustains an extraordinary degree of suspense.
Tiny, devastating touches -- how the same doll whose face rests on the ocean floor in 1996 is clutched in the arms of a pretty little girl who idolizes Jack, or a four-hanky coda seen in Rose's dream -- work as well as the film's big spectacle in giving the tragedy of "Titanic" its full dramatic impact. Though many of the story's minor characters are one-note (hardly the case with Kathy Bates's hearty Molly Brown or Bernard Hill's brave captain), the cumulative effect of their presence is anything but shallow.
Beyond its romance, "Titanic" offers an indelibly wrenching story of blind arrogance and its terrible consequences. It's the rare Hollywood adventure film that brings mythic images of tragedy -- the fall of Icarus, the ruin of Ozymandias -- so easily to mind.
The irony is that Mr. Cameron's "Titanic" is such a Titanic in its own right, a presumptuous reach for greatness against all reasonable odds. The film itself gambles everything on visual splendor and technological accomplishment, which is one reason its extravagance is fully justified on screen. But if Mr. Cameron's own brazenness echoes that seen in his story, remember the essential difference. This "Titanic" is too good to sink.
"Titanic" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes partial nudity, one brief sexual situation, mild profanity and the soul-shaking sight of a great ship going down.

Thicker Than Water, Oil, Whatever

BYLINE: By Caryn James 

 BODY:
The full title "Horton Foote's 'Alone' " is the first sign that this Showtime film offers something rare. Writers are not often billed as star creators, and then only if they are commercial behemoths, a Stephen King or a Tom Clancy. But no one deserves top billing more than Mr. Foote, who in his long career as a playwright and screenwriter has never looked down on the movies; he has brought the same honesty and eloquence to films like "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Tender Mercies" as he has to the theater, most recently in his profoundly moving play "The Young Man From Atlanta" (which won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize).
Like so much of Mr. Foote's best work, "Alone" captures the deep current of emotion beneath day-to-day events in the life of a Texas family. Hume Cronyn, who has fallen into too many cranky geezer roles lately, is unexpectedly endearing as John Webb, a gentle widower who lives alone on his struggling farm. Though the plot concerns the possibility of finding oil on his land, the story is truly about how families stay together and pull apart, as if all the relatives were caught in an elaborate, delicate-looking web made of steel. 
 Mr. Cronyn brings a wise smile to the role of Webb. He is a strong man whose loneliness after the loss of his wife of 52 years surfaces now and then, quickly and briefly in offhand remarks, only to be hidden again. Webb's two nephews and their wives, who own half the mineral rights to the land, are desperate for him to accept an oil company's offer.
The extended family is beautifully cast. Chris Cooper is especially touching and natural as the nephew always called Gus Jr., who is out of work and prone to painful headaches. A lesser writer would have handed Gus Jr. a brain tumor at the end; it is a mark of Mr. Foote's subtlety that those headaches remain as mysterious to us as they do to the family.
Frederic Forrest is Gus Jr.'s brother, Carl. The brothers have no strong feelings for their uncle, but together they attempt, without much success, to be discreet in trying to push the old man around. The wives reflect their husbands' hopes and add flashes of humor. Hallie Foote plays Gus Jr.'s wife, Agnes, impatient with their three surly children. Shelley Duvall is Carl's wife, Estelle, who has recently been told by a fortune teller that she will get rich.
Though Webb's two daughters live a drive away in Houston and are married with grown children, they have not lost their need for their father. It is a bold, revealing touch that Jacqueline (Joanna Miles) has white hair, as well as the hard luck that makes her and her unemployed husband move back to the farm.
Though the refrain heard throughout the story is, "Do you think they'll find oil?," Mr. Foote's dialogue is never portentous; instead it is translucent, allowing us to look below the surface of entirely natural speech and grasp the emotions it masks. "How can I help you children?" Webb asks Jacqueline and her husband, using the ordinary yet powerful phrasing of fathers everywhere.
James Earl Jones has a small role as Webb's friend and contemporary, who understands the way roots and families are made. Flawlessly directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg (best known for "Brideshead Revisited"), "Alone" captures that poignant balance of friendship and family, of endurance and change. A quiet anomaly among television films, it is also among the year's most bracing achievements.
 
'A Christmas Memory'
CBS, Sunday night
(Channel 2, New York, at 9)
Though Christmas is usually the time for treacly movies and tired music specials, sometimes it brings out fine programs, too. In this lovely new version of Truman Capote's unabashedly nostalgic story "A Christmas Memory," Patty Duke is Sook, the aging, childlike cousin who is the best friend of young Buddy (Eric Lloyd), the autobiographical hero. Set in the Depression, the story focuses on Sook and Buddy's holiday ritual of baking fruitcakes as gifts. This, it turns out, will be their last year together. Buddy will soon be sent to military school, away from the house where he is being raised by his old cousins, including Sook's two sisters (Piper Laurie as the stern Jennie and Anita Gillette as the soft-hearted Callie) and their hypochondriacal brother (Jeffrey DeMunn).
Ms. Duke gives Sook a spirited will to go along with her sensitivity, setting this interpretation apart from Geraldine Page's fluttery version from the 1960's. Though a bit too long, this beautifully textured "Christmas Memory" is wonderfully warm and sweet.
How did the real Buddy become a writer infatuated with his own celebrity? You can find out in the smart, dryly named documentary "Truman Capote: The Tiny Terror" (A&E's "Biography This Week," on Saturday at 8.) It includes a clip from the original "Christmas Memory," with Capote's own drawling narration.

HEADLINE: For the New Maestro at the Met, A Dashing Career to His Own Beat

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
Most important musical careers develop progressively, from step to logical next step. Not the career of the dynamic Russian conductor Valery Gergiyev.
In 1977, at the age of 24, he took second prize in the Herbert von Karajan Competition for conductors and led the Berlin Philharmonic in a performance of Tchaikovsky's "Pathetique" Symphony, bypassing the normal route to such a prestigious engagement: years of conducting in the provinces and steady growth. That same year, he began his association with the Kirov Opera in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, rising in just 10 years from assistant musical director to permanent conductor to artistic director of the entire Maryinsky Theater, home to the Kirov Opera and Ballet. There, he received, essentially, on-the-job training. 
 "My career in opera was totally unprepared," Mr. Gergiyev said the other day, while having breakfast near Lincoln Center before a morning rehearsal at the Metropolitan Opera House. "I arrived at the Kirov with no experience in opera. When I was young, I was not even interested in opera. And I conducted the Berlin Philharmonic before I conducted any serious Russian orchestra."
"My career," he added, "has been not in order."
His career may not have been in order, but it is thriving. At 44, Mr. Gergiyev is one of the most sought-after conductors of his generation. Tonight he conducts the first of seven performances at the Met of Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov," his first appearance there since the company announced that, starting next year, he would assume a new position: principal guest conductor. This comes after only three prior engagements.
In 1992, he brought the Kirov Opera to the Met for performances of three Russian works, including "Boris." In 1994, he conducted a new production of Verdi's "Otello" with Placido Domingo in the title role. Mr. Domingo, who had worked with him in Spain, was instrumental in bringing Mr. Gergiyev to the Met. And in the 1995-96 season, he conducted a new production of Tchaikovsky's "Queen of Spades."
Not wishing to be left out, the New York Philharmonic has engaged Mr. Gergiyev for what is in effect a short-term residency, beginning with a New Year's Eve gala, followed by two subscription series programs in the first weeks of January.
What qualities have made him so valued, so quickly? For one, he has the kind of intellect that absorbs everything around him. His English, learned not in the classroom but from travel, is excellent, even eloquent. Citing Beethoven's music as the first to make a decisive impression on him when he was a "young, possibly gifted boy," he speaks of the composer's "clarity of mind" and "imperative energy."
Mr. Gergiyev's own mind, it seems, has been focused on serious matters and high culture. As he talks over breakfast, by chance an acquaintance from the Boston Symphony Orchestra walks past with her friend James Taylor and introduces the two musicians. Afterward, Mr. Gergiyev admits to having never heard of James Taylor.
 
Before the Baton
Another factor in his success is his early musical training, which, however out of order, was rigorous. As a boy, he studied piano seriously, though he was just as interested in soccer and table tennis. But when the conductor Anatoly Briskin heard Mr. Gergiyev perform as a pianist, he took him on as a student, insisting that he would be a conductor.
The initial lessons were not about baton technique. "As the first thing, he asked me to learn to play from memory on the piano every part of Mozart's G minor Symphony, starting with the viola part," Mr. Gergiyev explained. "This was the way he expected me to master scores."
As with all exceptional talents, Mr. Gergiyev's has a large component of intuition, which made him a natural for dramatic music, once he turned to it. The soprano Renee Fleming, who has worked often with Mr. Gergiyev, describes the visceral excitement of his music-making.
"He pulls drama out of every phrase," she said during a telephone interview from Paris. "When he conducts the storm scene in 'Otello,' I feel like I'm caught in a storm."
Ms. Fleming was in the audience at the San Francisco Opera House when Mr. Gergiyev led a performance of Prokofiev's bizarre and musically incandescent opera "The Fiery Angel," and she said she would never forget it. "I was out of my seat," she said. "Valery is a shot in the arm for the opera world."
 
Family and Mountains
Conductors cannot inspire this kind of response with technical brilliance alone. It takes charisma, and Mr. Gergiyev, in his solemn way, has it. Tall and lanky, he is balletic and incisive on the podium. With his shock of thinning black hair and quick intelligence, he exudes energy. But there is sensitivity in his sad greenish eyes and delicate white fingers, which comes through in his work.
Asked to account for his achievements, Mr. Gergiyev places his family and heritage before any teacher. Though born in Moscow, he was raised in Vladikavkaz, the largest city of Ossetia in the northern region of the Caucasus Mountains. Many historians, Mr. Gergiyev explained, believe that the ancient Scythians, possibly the first inhabitants of Russia, came from there.
"Who I am is very much because of my parents," he said. His father, an army enlistee who rose to the rank of major during World War II, took his wife and three children on frequent hiking trips to the rugged nearby mountains, with "their fast rivers and wild animals," Mr. Gergiyev recalled. "You would have to compare these high mountains to Peru," he added. "The Swiss Alps are too mild."
His father died when Mr. Gergiyev was 14, leaving his indomitable mother, who worked in electronics, to rear the family. Today, Mr. Gergiyev, who is unmarried, shares two adjacent apartments in St. Petersburg with his mother, a sister and his sister's family. "I call them three or four times a day when I'm away," he said. "They give me connection and stability."
His mother, Mr. Gergiyev believes, first saw his "destiny" as a musician, and directed him to the Leningrad Conservatory. There, he studied with Ilya Musin, "one of the great teachers of the century," Mr. Gergiyev called him, who, at 94, still conducts major orchestras like the Royal Philharmonic in London.
Mr. Gergiyev's sense of heritage and constancy informs his leadership of the Kirov. During his tenure the company has gained international renown for its authoritative productions of Russian operas, both staples like Tchaikovsky's "Eugene Onegin," and previously neglected works like Prokofiev's "Betrothal in a Monastery," one of four operas that Mr. Gergiyev will conduct when he brings the Kirov Opera to the Met for a two-week festival in the spring.
 
Consistently High Quality
But under Mr. Gergiyev, the Kirov has also excelled in Italian and German opera. Recently he conducted Wagner's "Parsifal" with Mr. Domingo in the title role, a performance taped for video release. And a recent Philips recording of Verdi's "Forza del Destino" in its original 1862 version, which was written for the Imperial Theater in St. Petersburg, was critically hailed. Indeed, the quality of Mr. Gergiyev's work with his company is so consistently high that Philips has produced a continuing series of complete Russian operas recorded live at the Kirov.
"I stay at the Kirov because I believe in the place," Mr. Gergiyev said. "If you change your commitment every few years, you lose concentration."
The sets and costumes for the Met's "Boris Godunov" date from 1974. But everything else about the production will be newsworthy. Except for the American bass Samuel Ramey, who sings Boris, all the lead singers are Russian colleagues of Mr. Gergiyev's, including, in her much awaited Met debut, the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina, who is to perform Marina despite being almost visibly pregnant.
These performances will also serve as the tryout for a new orchestration of the opera prepared by Igor Buketoff, an American conductor and historian of Russian heritage. Mussorgsky was not well trained in orchestration. Whether his original scoring is crude and uninformed, or spare and striking, has been much debated. For years, the opera was known through the lush orchestration prepared by Rimsky-Korsakov. There have been others, including a beefy, brassy, modernist orchestration by Shostakovich.
Mr. Gergiyev essentially believes in the original version, but acknowledges its shortcomings. "You can achieve about 90 percent of the desired effect with Mussorgsky's orchestration," he said. "But there are passages that are impossible: two trombones alone, nothing else, or soft pizzicato strings and loud brass together."
When he performs the original version, he alters the score without compunction. The new version he will introduce is a pragmatic synthesis, what Mr. Buketoff came up with after "a long, quiet talk with Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and Shostakovich," Mr. Gergiyev said. "It is more formal, more polite."
"But," he added, "this may be best for a large house like the Met."
Still, Mr. Gergiyev felt that even Mr. Buketoff's work needed adjustments, and in rehearsal with the orchestra the other day, he was uninhibited about making them.
At one point he said to the brass players: "The trumpets give a nice, bright color when they appear once in a while. But the way it is orchestrated here they become too much a presence in a long passage. So let's cut them."
Later, he asked that a slow, ominous, alternating triplet figure in the lowest range of the basses be more varied. But this could be corrected without changing the orchestration. "Make it sound like a slithering snake," he said.
 
World of the Met
Afterward, explaining his decision to accept the Met post, he spoke of the orchestra, which works, he said, like "a cooperative, responsible, collective friend," and of the company's world-class stature. He is also impressed by the organization of the place, especially compared with the Kirov.
The finances of the Kirov are as shaky as the Russian economy. But the precariousness has an up side: spontaneity.
"At the Kirov I am more or less free," he said. "If I decide next year I want to do, say, 'Pelleas et Melisande,' I can do it. That gives me flexibility. But it creates difficulty."
 
'The Best of Both Worlds'
The Met is the opposite, he said. "I know I am committed to a rehearsal at 11 A.M. on Wednesday in the year 2000," he said. "But that is why the Met is so strong. I hope I will be able to bring some of that organization to the Kirov. But for me now, I have the best of both worlds."
Joseph Volpe, the general manager of the Met, cites Mr. Gergiyev's appointment as a big step in addressing a persistent charge of critics: the lack of big-name guest conductors on the roster.
"People claim James Levine is hogging everything, but that is just not true," Mr. Volpe said. "Most important conductors cannot commit the time required to rehearse and perform an opera here over a period of many weeks. But in bringing Valery to the Met, we are really beginning to get the world's premier conductors into the house. And it's the work that interests him, not some chance to build his reputation."
Mr. Gergiyev agrees.
"I am not coming to the Met for more reviews and more applause. I have already done my third and fourth performances with the major orchestras and companies in the world. That is behind me. But maybe I can bring a certain kind of color, repertory and life to this institution."

Philadelphia Fed Report Lifts Bond Prices

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rallied yesterday, after a report showed a slump in manufacturing in the Philadelphia region and was thought to suggest that Asia's turmoil might be slowing economic growth in the United States.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 30/32, to 102 23/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.93 percent from 6 percent. 
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported yesterday that its index of regional manufacturing unexpectedly fell to -1.3 this month from 10.1 in November, the first negative reading in a year. A reading of less than zero means more manufacturers are reporting weaker business than increased activity.
The report "obviously is pretty positive for bonds," said Garth Nisbet, who manages $750 million of bonds at Crabbe Huson Group in Portland, Ore. Thirty-year bond yields could fall as low as 5.5 percent in the first half of next year, he said.
Worries about Asia's impact on the United States economy drove stocks down -- raising the allure of Treasury securities, traders said. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 110.91 points, or 1.4 percent.
"Asia may really be having an impact," said Robert Blakemore, who oversees the management of $200 million of assets at National Bank of Arizona in Phoenix. "With the Philly Fed number this morning, it looks like manufacturing activity could slow."
Bonds also rose as the dollar gained against the yen on speculation that a package of tax cuts will do little to spur Japan's economy.
"The vote in the bond market is that the Japanese plan won't be the watershed event to change the Asian outlook," said Patrick Dimick, a government bond strategist at UBS Securities.
The bond market will next turn its attention to supply as the Treasury sells $26 billion in new notes. The two-year note is to be auctioned on Monday, and the five-year note on Tuesday.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.64 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 5.70 percent.

HEADLINE: Clinton Plans to Lower Another Barrier to Trade With Vietnam

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, citing Vietnam's progress in allowing free emigration, intends to move toward more normal trading relations with Hanoi, officials said today.
President Clinton has notified members of Congress that he expects early next year to grant Vietnam a waiver from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which bars full economic ties with nations that restrict travel and emigration. 
 White House and State Department officials said today that Vietnam permits its citizens to leave freely and has assisted in resettling thousands of Vietnamese refugees who had been living in camps elsewhere in Asia.
The Administration's intention to move toward fuller trade ties was first reported today by The Los Angeles Times.
The waiver paves the way for normal trading relations, known as most-favored-nation status. American business groups have been pressing for the waiver because it will permit Government agencies to provide financing and loan guarantees for the purchase of American-made goods by Vietnam.
Trade between the United States and Vietnam last year totaled $1 billion. Business groups expect trade with the rapidly modernizing nation to grow dramatically when all barriers are lifted.
But full economic ties are still probably at least a year away. Even if Congress accepts the waiver, Washington and Hanoi must still negotiate a trade and investment treaty; those talks are in preliminary stages.
Some Congressional opposition is expected from members who do not believe Hanoi has told everything it knows about American servicemen missing in the Vietnam War. But the Administration is likely to prevail because of the large opportunities for American businesses.
The waiver would permit the Export-Import Bank to underwrite loans for American businesses selling goods in Vietnam and lift one barrier to providing insurance against political risk by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. But the law governing such insurance sets several other hurdles that Vietnam may have trouble surmounting, including a prohibition on the use of forced labor, which human rights groups say exists in Vietnam.
Samuel R. Berger, the White House national security adviser, said today that the Administration is largely satisfied with Vietnam's cooperation on missing servicemen, an issue that for years blocked establishment of diplomatic ties. That came in 1995, two decades after the end of the bitter war.
"In addition, Vietnam has established a very solid record on implementation of emigration policies," Mr. Berger said. Other necessary consultations are taking place, he said, adding, "If those consultations go well, I would expect that we would go forward."
Senator Craig Thomas, Republican of Wyoming and chairman of the East Asia subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview that he expected an extensive debate in Congress over the waiver. But he predicted that the Administration and American businesses would ultimately succeed.
"This brings us back to the old question of whether we can best influence their behavior by opening relations further or by standing at arm's length," Mr. Thomas said. "I don't agree that trade is the most important thing in the world. But I do believe that it gives us an entree to make the kinds of changes that are of critical value to us."

HEADLINE: Dollar Is Up Against the Yen and the Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rebounded against the yen yesterday from Wednesday's decline amid questions whether Japan's central bank would keep supporting its currency and concerns that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's measures to stimulate the economy might not be strong enough.
The dollar's strength against the yen extended somewhat, as well, to the German mark. 
 In New York yesterday, the dollar moved as high as 129.45 yen before settling at 128.72 yen, up from 127.08 Wednesday. It rose to 1.7757 marks from 1.7735. The dollar declined against the British pound, which settled at $1.6653, up from $1.6521.
Japan's economic troubles could persist despite Mr. Hashimoto's announcement Wednesday that a two trillion yen income tax cut, as well as public works spending and corporate tax cuts, would be included in an economic-stimulus package. Some economists said an income tax cut of five trillion yen, or nearly $40 billion, would have been better.
Analysts said the yen-dollar exchange rate might rise with central bank intervention, but would eventually reflect the state of Japan's underlying economy. They noted some forecasts of 140 yen to the dollar.
Some in the currency market spent the session considering the chance of another intervention by the Bank of Japan similar to its dollar sales and yen purchases on Wednesday, perhaps around $3.4 billion worth. They indicated the central bank would await price weakness to intervene, for maximum effect.
Thin trading ahead of the year-end holidays magnified the dollar's rise against the yen yesterday, leading some to discount its importance. "The lack of liquidity in the market today brought about a very sharp and violent move in dollar-yen," said John McCarthy, senior vice president at ING Barings Capital Markets. "There was no news out."
The dollar got some support from news that the American trade deficit in October narrowed to $9.7 billion, below expectations of $10.8 billion.

HEADLINE: DECISION IN BOSNIA;
In the President's Words: Toward 'a Lasting Peace'

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of the White House news conference yesterday in which President Clinton announced a commitment in principle to extend the stay of American troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina beyond June 1998, the expiration date of the mandate for the NATO peacekeeping force now stationed there. The transcript was prepared by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company.
 
OPENING STATEMENT
I want to speak with you today about the progress we have made toward a lasting peace in Bosnia and the challenges that still must be faced in order to finish the job. 
 For nearly four years, Bosnia was the battleground for the bloodiest war in Europe since World War II. The conflict killed or wounded one out of every 10 Bosnians. It drove half the country's people from their homes, left 9 out of 10 of them unemployed.
We will never be able to forget the mass graves, the women and young girls victimized by systematic campaigns of rape, skeletal prisoners locked behind barbed-wire fences, endless lines of refugees marching toward a future of despair.
The war in Bosnia was abhorrent to our values. It also threatened our national interests. We have learned the hard way in this century that Europe's stability and America's security are joined. The war threatened to explode into a broader conflict in the Balkans, endangering the vital interests of allies like Greece and Turkey and undermining our efforts to build a peaceful, undivided and democratic Europe. Then, two years ago, in Dayton, Ohio, American leadership helped to end the war in Bosnia. With our allies in NATO and others, we launched an extraordinary military and political effort to implement the peace agreement.
Twenty-four months later, by almost any measure, the lives of Bosnia's people are better and their hopes for the future are brighter. Consider what we have achieved together:
We ended the fighting and the bloodshed, separating rival armies, demobilizing more than 350,000 troops, destroying almost 6,600 heavy weapons.
We helped Bosnians to put in place national democratic institutions, including a presidency, a parliament, a Supreme Court, and hold peaceful and free elections for all levels of government, with turnouts exceeding 70 percent.
We've begun to restore normal life, repairing roads and schools, electricity and water, heat and sewage, doubling economic output, quadrupling wages. Unemployment in the Bosnian-Croat Federation has been cut from 90 percent to 50 percent.
We're helping the Bosnians to provide for their own security, training ethnically integrated police forces in the Federation, taking the first steps toward a professional, democratic police force in the Serb Republic.
We've helped to turn the media from an instrument of war into a force for peace, stifling the inflammatory radio and television broadcasts that helped to fuel the conflict.
And we've provided a secure environment for 350,000 displaced persons to return to their homes, while bringing 22 war criminals to justice.
Just a few hours ago SFOR captured and transported to The Hague two more war crimes suspects.
The progress is unmistakable, but it is not yet irreversible. Bosnia has been at peace only half as long as it was at war. It remains poised on a tightrope, moving toward a better future, but not at the point yet of a self-sustaining peace. To get there, the people of Bosnia still need the safety net and the helping hand not only of the international -- that only the international community, including the United States, can provide.
Our assistance must be two-fold. First, we must intensify our civilian and economic engagement. As a result of the progress we've achieved in recent months, we know where to focus our efforts. Civilian and voluntary agencies, working with Bosnian authorities, must help to do the following things:
First, deepen and spread economic opportunity while rooting out corruption. Second, reform, retrain and re-equip the police. Third, restructure the state-run media to meet international standards of objectivity and access, and establish alternative, independent media. Fourth, help more refugees return home. And fifth, make indicted war criminals answer for their crimes, both as a matter of justice and because they are stumbling blocks to lasting stability.
The second thing we must do is to continue to provide an international military presence that will enable these efforts to proceed in an atmosphere of confidence. Our progress in Bosnia to date would not have been possible without the secure environment created first by IFOR, now by SFOR. They've allowed dozens of civilian agencies and literally hundreds of voluntary agencies to do their job in security, laying the foundation for a self-sustaining peace.
In authorizing American troops to take part in the SFOR mission, I said the mission would end in 18 months, in June of 1998. It was my expectation that by that time we would have rebuilt enough of Bosnia's economic and political life to continue the work without continuing outside military support. But following intensive consultations with my national security and military advisers, with our NATO allies and with leaders from both parties in Congress, it has become clear that the progress we've seen in Bosnia, in order for it to continue, a follow-on military force led by NATO will be necessary after SFOR ends. America is a leader of NATO, and America should participate in that force.
Therefore, I have instructed our representative to NATO to inform our allies that, in principle, the United States will take part in a security presence in Bosnia when SFOR withdraws this summer.
The agreement, in principle, will become a commitment only when I have approved the action plan NATO's military authorities will develop and present, early next year, after careful study of all the options. The details of that plan, including the mission's specific objectives, its size and its duration, must be agreed to by all NATO allies.
Without prejudging the details, let me make clear the key criteria the plan must meet for me to approve the United States's participation:
First, the mission must be achievable and tied to concrete benchmarks, not a deadline. We should have clear objectives that when set -- when met -- will create a self-sustaining, secure environment and allow us to remove our troops.
Second, the force must be able to protect itself. Over two years, we have steadily decreased the number of our troops in Bosnia, from about 27,000 Americans in IFOR in 1996 to 8,500 in SFOR today. I hope the follow-on force will be smaller, but I will insist it be sufficient in number and in equipment to achieve its mission and to protect itself in safety.
Third, the United States must retain command. Time and again, events have proven that American leadership is crucial to decisive collective action.
Fourth, our European allies must assume their share of responsibility. Now, Europe and other partners are already doing a great deal; providing three times as many troops as we are, five times as much economic assistance, nine times as many international police; 10 times as many refugees have been received by them. And while Bosnia is a challenge to American interests and values, the longer-term and fundamental challenge is to make Bosnia a genuine part of Europe. And we hope the Europeans will do more.
Fifth, the cost must be manageable.
And sixth and finally, the plan must have substantial support from Congress and the American people. I have been pleased with the spirit and the substance of our consultations with leading members of both parties. As we develop the details of the new NATO mission, these consultations must and will continue.
I am pleased that members of both parties in both houses of Congress have accepted my invitation to go to Bosnia with me when I leave in a couple of days.
All of us have a duty to explain the stakes in Bosnia to the American people, and I will do my very best to shoulder my responsibility for that.
Now some say a lasting peace in Bosnia is impossible, and therefore we should end our efforts now, in June, and/or allow the country to be partitioned along ethnic lines. I believe they're profoundly wrong. A full and fair reading of Bosnia's history and an honest assessment of the progress of the last 23 months simply refutes the proposition that the Dayton peace agreement cannot work. But if we pull out before the job is done, Bosnia almost certainly will fall back into violence, chaos, and, ultimately, a war every bit as bloody as the one that was stopped.
And partition is not a good alternative. It would sanction the horrors of ethnic cleansing and send the wrong signal to extremists everywhere. At best, partition would require a peacekeeping force to patrol a volatile border for years to come. More likely it would set the stage also for renewed conflict.
A lasting peace is possible along the lines of the Dayton peace agreement. For decades Muslims, Croats, and Serbs lived together, worked together, raised their families together. Thanks to the investments of America and others in Bosnia over the past two years, they have begun again to lead more normal lives.
Ultimately, Bosnia's future is in the hands of its own people. But we can help them make it a future of peace. We should finish the job we began, for the sake of that future and in the service of our own interests and values.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. Mr. President, a number of Americans are understandably going to be concerned about an open-ended U.S. military commitment to Bosnia. Can you at least assure the American people that by the time you leave office little more than three years from now, those American troops will be out of Bosnia?
A. Well, in order to answer that, let's go back and see what our experience has been. First of all, the big military mission, IFOR, really was completed within a year. In fact, it was completed in less than a year. That is, the robust, large military presence we needed there -- I think we had over 60,000 total allied troops there -- to end the war, separate the forces, establish the separation zone between the parties, it was achieved quickly and with remarkable peace and remarkably low loss of life for all of our allied forces who were there.
But then we went to the smaller force to try to support the civilian implementation of the Dayton agreement. Now, what has happened? An enormous amount of progress has been made. We don't believe the peace is self-sustaining. I think the responsible thing for me to do, since I do not believe we can meet the 18-month deadline, and no one I know now believes that, is to say to the American people what the benchmarks are.
What are the benchmarks? Let's talk about that. Can they be achieved in the near term? I believe they can. Do I think we should have a permanent presence in Bosnia? No. I don't believe this is like Germany after World War II, or in the cold war, or Korea after the Korean War. This is not what I'm suggesting here. But what are the benchmarks?
First let me say the final set of benchmarks must be developed by our NATO allies working with us. But let me give you just some of the things that I think we ought to be asking ourselves.
Number one, are the joint institutions strong enough to be self-
sustaining after the military operation? Number two, have the political parties really given up the so-called state-run media that have been instruments of hate and venom? Number three, is the civilian police large enough, well-trained enough, well-managed enough to do the job it has to do?
Those are just some of the benchmarks, I think -- when we go through this, I want a full public discussion of it. But I will say again, I understand your job is to try to get the deadline nailed down; but we tried it in this SFOR period, and it turned out we were wrong. I am not suggesting a permanent presence in Bosnia. I am suggesting that it's a more honest thing to do to say what our objectives are and that these objectives should be pursued, and they can be pursued at an affordable cost with fair burden-sharing with the Europeans. If that can be done, we should pursue them.
 Q. Mr. President, the lead prosecutor in the war crimes tribunal says that Mladic and Karadzic can rest easy because the French won't try to capture them. What is the United States willing to do to bring these men to justice?
A. Well, I don't want to comment on what the prosecutor has said about the French. I can tell you this, that, you know, we were involved this morning with the Dutch. And it was in their sector, and they took the lead. They asked us for support, just like we were involved with the British, not very long ago, when they made their arrests.
And we believe that provision of the Dayton agreement is important, as I said again today, and we think that all of us who are there should be prepared to do what is appropriate to implement it. And I think that having said that, the less I say from now on in, the better.
We believe the war-crimes process is an important part of Dayton. The United States, indeed, is supporting an international, permanent war crimes tribunal. Even as we speak, we've got countries working on trying to establish that.
Q. Mr. President, Sir, one of the benchmarks you listed was the willingness of the political parties there, really, to work toward progress. Does that not make us hostages of those political figures there, particularly those who don't want progress? They can simply undermine the attempt to reach that benchmark and keep U.S. troops there forever.
A. Well, let me -- I don't think I was clear about that. But what I mean is the willingness of the political parties, or whether they're willing or not, our capacity to stop them from, in effect, perverting the state-run media and using them as an instrument of violence and suppression. I don't think it's necessary for us to stay until -- until everybody wants to go have tea together at 4 in the afternoon, in a civil environment.
I think it's a -- I do think that there are -- and again, let me say we will -- we will make public a final set of benchmarks before we go forward with this. And our allies have to work on this. I'm just telling what my thoughts are.
But -- but if you look at where we've really had problems -- or let's, let's flip the question, say. Why do we think we still need some military presence there after June? I think because there is -- there -- we believe there is more venom still in the political system than there otherwise would have been if there had been no perversion of the so-called state-run media by the political parties that control them. We believe that if the joint institutions were working a little more effectively, they would -- the people would see the benefits of the joint institutions more than they will by June.
We -- we're grateful that there are 2,000 civilian police working there. And I might say while the United States has put up 90 percent of the money, as I've said, the Europeans have put up 90 percent of the personnel for the training and the preparation of the civilian police. But there should be more.
So I think that's what we have to do. I do not want to hold us hostage to the feelings of the people of Bosnia, although I believe the feelings will change as the facts of life change. But I do think we should stay there until we believe we've got the job done.
 Q. Mr. President, how did you get Secretary Cohen on board on this? And you know, the whole public perception -- unless you go after the highest-profile alleged war criminals, it doesn't have much of an impact. Why the restraint?
A. Well, first of all, the circumstances under which the SFOR troops will apprehend war criminals have been fairly well-defined. We did not send SFOR there to mount major military campaigns. Secondly, I don't want to discuss the circumstances in detail under which we might or might not go after anyone. But let me go to the point underlying your question, I think it is, which is, can this peace be made to work unless Mr. Karadzic is arrested? I mean, let's just sort of get to the bottom line here.
I think the answer to that is, under the right circumstances. That is, if he flees the country, if he's deep enough underground, if he can't have any impact on it, we might make the peace work anyway. After all, a great deal of progress has been made. I would point out that more progress has been made in the Bosnian Croat -- the Muslim-Croat Federation part of Bosnia economically than in the Serbian part, in part because reactionary elements there have resisted doing the right thing across the board in many areas.
Q. Are you considering aid for Serbia in that respect?
A. Well, I'm considering -- what I'm going to do is to work with the allies to implement the Dayton accords. And our position is going to be we're going to support the people that are trying to implement the Dayton framework and we're going to oppose those who are opposing it, in all specifics. If you use that benchmark, I think it will get you there.
Q. Mr. President, just to help wrap up this by asking you the question -- a lot of Republican critics of yours are suggesting that your credibility was undermined on Bosnia by imposing these two deadlines which you failed to meet, and knowing that some of your own advisers at the time were saying don't give these deadlines because they're unrealistic, that the job can't be done within a year or within 18 months.
So how do you answer your critics now, like Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison or Arlen Specter or Newt Gingrich, who say that you have to prove your credibility because you failed to honor these two earlier imposed deadlines?
A. Well first of all, let me say I have a fundamentally different view of the first deadline. I mean, we did -- the mission I defined for IFOR was achieved, and it was achieved before a year was out. And I was -- it's not worth going through and rewriting history there about who said what at the time. I did think that in 18 months -- I honestly believed in 18 months, we could get this done at the time I said it. And it wasn't -- I wasn't right, which is why I don't want to make that error again.
Now, having acknowledged the error I made, let's look at what we were right about. Let's flip this around before we get too much into who was right about what happened on the -- after 18 months.
What has happened? With the leadership of the United States, NATO and its allies, including Russia, working side by side, ended almost overnight and with virtually no bloodshed, the worst war in Europe since World War II. We have seen democratic elections, with 70-percent participation, take place. Hundreds of thousands of people have been able to go home under circumstances that were difficult to say the least. Economic growth has resumed. Infrastructure has been rebuilt. The conditions of normal life have come back for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, of people.
So if I take the hit for being wrong about the timetable, I would like some acknowledgment that, in the larger issue here, the United States and its allies were right to undertake this mission and that the results of the mission have been very, very good. They have justified the effort. And the cost of the mission in lives and treasure, to the United States and to its allies, has been much lower than even the most ardent supporters of the mission thought that it would be.
So I think -- I don't mind taking a hit for being wrong about the timetable. But after the hit is dished out, I would like the larger truth looked at; that is: Did we do the right thing? Was it in our interests? Did it further our values? Are the American people less likely to be drawn into some other conflict in Europe 10, 20, 30 years from now, where the costs could be far greater, if we make this work? I think they are.
And I'd like to close, basically, with a conversation I had from my opponent in the last election, Senator Dole. I want to give him -- he said something that I thought was very good and pithier than anything I have said about this.
Now, we had a talk about it the other day on the phone, and he said, he said, "Look," he said, "You know, I didn't necessarily agree with all the details about how you got to where you were." But he said: "What's happened in Bosnia? It's like we're in a football game, we're in the fourth quarter, and we're winning. And some people suggest we should walk off the field and forfeit the game. I don't think we should. I think we ought to stay here, finish the game, and collect the win." And that's a pretty good analogy and would do credit to the Senator. I appreciate it. I wish I'd have thought of it myself.

HEADLINE: South Korean Election Results Hearten Emigres in New York

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
When Joseph Seok left South Korea 19 years ago, democracy and economic stability in the country seemed distant, unattainable dreams. So despite the country's recent economic downturn, yesterday's election of Kim Dae Jung, the longtime opposition leader whom Seoul's ruling party had repeatedly tried to have assassinated, greatly heartened Mr. Seouk.
"This is the first time in Korea that the opposition party won," Mr. Seouk, 49, said yesterday afternoon on a sidewalk in Flushing, Queens, as he devoured results of the presidential election in a special edition of The Chosun Daily. "Democracy in Korea has very much improved." 
 In one of the city's Koreatowns, up and down Union Street in Flushing, most Korean-Americans interviewed yesterday reacted positively to the outcome of one of the most important elections in their country's history. Shoppers snapped up special four-page editions of The Chosun Daily, The Korea Central Daily and The Korea Times at the Canaan Bakery, and digested the information at the Koryodang coffee shop.
Although Seoul does not permit nonresident citizens to cast ballots, many Korean-Americans returned briefly to South Korea to volunteer in campaigns, said Pyong Gap Min, a Korean-born sociology professor at Queens College who has written extensively about Korean-Americans. The economic collapse had heightened interest in the election.
But even more significantly, the closeness of the race between Mr. Kim and Lee Hoi Chang in the days leading to the election raised the possibility of a historic moment: the first peaceful transfer of the presidency to the opposition party in modern Korean history. And that prospect resonated deeply among many Korean-Americans, because many of them had immigrated here decades ago from a very different Korea, one where Mr. Kim seemed forever destined to a seat in the political bleachers. In 1987, in one of Mr. Kim's three unsuccessful campaigns, military officers warned that they might stage a coup or kill him if he were elected president.
James Kim, 50, smoking a cigarette on the corner of Union Street and 37th Avenue, said, "I'm happy because the elections ended peacefully." Of the 18 years since he had left South Korea, Mr. Kim said, he is proudest of the fact that the country has moved away from an authoritarian regime.
So yesterday's results put Mr. Kim in a good mood, even though he said he had backed Mr. Lee and believed that the 72-year-old President-elect is too old. What is more, when asked whether he thought Mr. Kim -- who worried bankers and investors by repeatedly calling for the renegotiation of the $57 billion bailout by the International Monetary Fund -- could lead South Korea back to prosperity, James Kim said, "Umm -- I hope so."
Not surprisingly, the ascendancy of a former political pariah -- who spent the 1970's in prison, house arrest or exile -- carried less symbolic meaning for some younger Korean-Americans. At BL Men's Wear, Sun Park, 33, had no customers. She worried that her business, which depends almost completely on Korean-Americans whose pocketbooks are tied to the economic fortunes of Asia, would not revive under Mr. Kim.
"They're all the same: old men with the same ideas," Mrs. Park said of Mr. Kim and the current President, Kim Young-sam. She said she had backed Mr. Lee, who is 62.
At the Koryodang coffee shop, Tae Joon Park, 40, and Jeung Hwan Kim, 28, were poring over the breakdown of the vote by province in The Chosun Daily and commenting on historic regional divisions. Mr. Kim, a recent graduate of the Pratt Institute, marveled that in the President-elect's home base in the southwest, he had won more than 90 percent of the vote. By contrast, in Jeung Hwan Kim's native city, Taegu, in the southeast, the President-elect had drawn only 12.5 percent.
Still, Mr. Kim was optimistic that the President-elect's slim victory would be good for South Korea. "Even if he was elected by a very small margin, I think he will do a very good job, because he has a lot of political experience for more than 30 years," Mr. Kim said. After a few minutes, he added, more cautiously: "Personally, I liked Lee Hoi Chang. I thought Kim Dae Jung was too old. But since he's elected, I hope he'll do a good job."

HEADLINE: U.S. Effort to Cut Its Dues Dies at an Angry U.N.

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The United States effort to lower its United Nations dues is doomed for now, making it even less likely that Congress will release the more than $1 billion America owes the organization.
For years Congress has objected to paying arrears because of complaints about United Nations operations and the financial burden on the United States. But most recently, Congress has tied paying the debt to a reduction in America's dues, and now the other members of the United Nations have replied by making payments on the arrears a condition for reconsidering the level of the American assessment. 
 With a final decision on the amount of America's dues likely in the next few days, the United States is completely isolated in the General Assembly committee determining the issue.
Even traditional allies are rejecting Washington's demand that it pay less than the current 25 percent of the organization's regular annual budget, an amount based on the American share of the world's economy.
At most, delegations are willing to keep open the option of discussing the issue again next year, but only if the United States significantly reduces its overdue bill.
The United States has also been handicapped in fighting efforts by some developing nations to inflate the United Nations budget, which Congress has demanded show no growth.
The third world has already been successful in drastically lowering the dues paid by the poorest nations -- from about $110,000 this year to less than $13,000 annually over the next three years, a move Washington considers irresponsible.
"By our failure to pay our arrears, we have essentially been wiped out of this debate," said Richard Sklar, the American diplomat negotiating budgetary matters.
American diplomats and State Department officials say there has never been a worse time to represent the United States at the United Nations. The resentment against Washington, once muted, is now openly expressed.
Diplomats from a wide range of countries say they are incensed that Americans should expect the near-bankrupt organization to carry out American policies in Iraq, Haiti or other areas, when the United States is more than $1 billion behind in its payments.
"The position of the European Union," a European diplomat said, "is that if the Congress is willing to recognize the damage that is being done to the United States' position at the United Nations -- and indeed the weakening of the U.N. -- and elects then to pay its arrears, then we are prepared to reopen discussion on the scales of assessment." The assessments are normally set for a three-year period.
"That is a sizable concession under the circumstances," the diplomat added.
Both friends of the United States and nations that have often voted against Washington's interests are unanimous in saying that they feel they have been betrayed by Clinton Administration promises that arrears would begin to be paid this year.
Payment of the debt was supposedly worked out earlier this year under a deal between Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and two influential Senators -- Jesse Helms, the Republican of North Carolina who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the committee.
As part of that deal, the Administration and Congress had agreed that the United States would press for a gradual lowering of America's assessment rate from 25 to 20 percent over the next three years.
But the deal collapsed in November when Congressional Republicans blocked payment of the dues and other measures.
Christopher H. Smith, a New Jersey Republican, attached an anti-abortion rider to legislation in Congress that included money for the United Nations, effectively killing the bill. Secretary General Kofi Annan called the action "unreasonable and regrettable."
Congressional aides say they see little hope for many months of reviving the legislation that was blocked in November.
But Senator Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican who is chairman of the Senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees payments to international organizations, said in an interview today that the deal with the Administration, which he helped draft, was still very much alive.
"That agreement is still in place and will be executed as soon as we clear this ancillary, extraneous issue that has nothing to do with the U.N.," he said, referring to the abortion issue. "That will be cleared up."
A refusal by member nations to lower American dues "would merely throw into jeopardy what we thought was a done deal," he said. "Speaking for myself, I'd say there's a darn good chance the money will never be spent if they take this action."
Alvin P. Adams Jr., a former American Ambassador to Haiti and Peru who is president of the United Nations Association, an independent American research and support group, said that the Administration had in essence lost twice: in Congress, where House leaders refused to detach the anti-abortion amendment, and then in the United Nations, where the standoff has significantly lowered American prestige.
"It's a real disgrace for a country that helped inspire and played such a role in the founding of the U.N. and has been a consistent supporter, that legislation, conditional as it was, failed in Washington due to what we believe is an extraneous issue," Mr. Adams said in an interview.
"I don't know what this says about U.S. leadership in the world these days, and the limit others have when looking at that leadership," he said.
Those who call the shots in Congress are going to be unpleasantly surprised, he said. "It plays right into the hands of those who do not mean us a lot of good."
Mr. Sklar, a former businessman who was in charge of the Administration's reconstruction program for Bosnia, has been negotiating the dues issue virtually around the clock for the last few weeks. He said in an interview today that this is "crunch time" for the United Nations and its relationship to Washington.
If the United Nations budget, now set at about $2.585 billion for the next two years, is allowed to grow because of votes in the 185-member General Assembly, Congressional leaders have said they would withhold the money altogether.
American diplomats have had to defend the action by Congress, which has also cut contributions to the separate peacekeeping budget from 31 percent to 25 percent, against charges by other United Nations members who consider Washington in breach of its treaty obligations.
Mr. Sklar said that Congress's action is, however, the reality everyone has to work with.

HEADLINE: Giving at the Home Office;
Municipalities Set New Charges for In-House Businesses

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: TACOMA, Wash.

 BODY:
After enduring countless difficulties setting up an at-home business in a nearby suburb, Joe and Teri Comroe moved here five years ago so they could repair clocks and watches from their house.
The Comroes paid Tacoma $72 for a basic business license to open their Reliable Time Shop, which they run in two rooms of a small house in a neighborhood where each adjoining house also harbors a home-based business. 
 Two years later, the Comroes' business taxes increased after the Tacoma City Council decided to require home businesses to buy an additional license purely for the privilege of operating out of their home. The $122 a year that the Comroes pay may seem trivial, but it illustrates how Tacoma, like many other cities, has found a new, though still modest, source of revenue from the exploding number of home businesses.
"The city calls it a home-occupancy license," Mr. Comroe said, "but it's really just a tax, just a way to take in more money."
In recent years, as many big corporations have downsized and more people have gone into business for themselves, the home-business phenomenon has emerged from obscurity. And many cities, rather than ignoring or trying to suppress it as they often did in the past, are seeking to exploit the trend to their own advantage.
The first step in this process for many cities has been to revise zoning laws that were drafted to prohibit home businesses in an era when many such workplaces were smelly, messy industrial operations, such as repairing car engines.
After that relatively simple step, the most aggressive of these cities have gone much further, both in seeking to make the cities attractive for home businesses and to tap a little vein of revenue from them. And in hunting for unlicensed businesses, they have uncovered many more than they expected. The extra revenue they get from these previously untaxed companies is helping to hold down pressures to raise taxes elsewhere.
Polly Rumbough, the occupational licensing official in Tampa, Fla., said, "We are taxing, not regulating." Her city, she added, now counts on fees from home-based businesses and professionals for $8 million annually, or 2 percent of the city's general operating budget.
Business license fees are not the only levies that apply to home businesses. In many places a gross receipts tax is charged, one that covers not just profit but all revenue. And there are other ways to increase local revenues. In Colorado, for example, a homeowner who converts a couple of rooms into business space may receive a higher property tax bill. That's because commercial real estate is taxed at three times the rate of residences.
Across the country, municipal tax officials say that they often encounter hostility from home-business owners. Many of them assert that they are exempt from taxes because they work from their homes; indeed, a group of Hollywood screenwriters is making that argument now in Federal court.
Nationwide, about 20.7 million households, or one in five, engage in some form of home business, according to surveys by IDC/Link, a research company in New York. That is a 43 percent increase from the estimated 14.2 million households in 1990, said Raymond L. Boggs, the firm's director of home office research.
The survey is consistent with what municipal tax officials from Santa Monica, Calif., to Roanoke, Va., have discovered. They report that 20 percent to 50 percent of the new business licenses they issue these days are for home businesses.
Mr. Boggs said that about 13 million households rely on a home business as their primary source of income, averaging $80,000 in gross receipts annually. There are also about 9 million households with a part-time home business with average receipts of $10,000, he said. The number of full-time and part-time businesses is greater than the total, he said, because some households operate more than one enterprise at home.
Home businesses are flourishing across the country. In Tacoma there are 14,000 registered businesses. Of those, 3,280 operate out of homes, up from 795 just three years ago, according to Duston J. Jensen, Tacoma's tax manager, whose creative approach to finding new sources of revenue has earned him the admiration of municipal tax and business license officials across the country.
The home businesses bring the city $400,000 in annual revenue, or more than $2 a resident, money that Mr. Jensen said "helps us keep down taxes on all the other businesses."
Many of those businesses are found through the aggressive tactics of Mr. Jensen, who is so proud of his position that he drives around with a personalized license plate that reads, "TAXMAN1."
Not every city is as successful as Tacoma. For instance, Minneapolis, with twice the population of Tacoma, has licensed only 12,000 businesses, said James Moncur, the director of licensing there. It is probably missing hundreds -- if not thousands -- of home businesses, experts said.
Indeed, simply locating these businesses can be extraordinarily difficult."When a home-based business relies on brain power married to a computer, telephone and a fax," said Deborah Crowder, revenue manager for Asheville, N.C., "the hard part is finding them. We license them when we can find them."
Mr. Jensen, Ms. Crowder and others use data that the Internal Revenue Service shares with some of the states. City officials are not permitted to obtain financial data on individual Federal taxpayers, but they are entitled to the name, address and the industrial classification code for a taxpayer's line of business.
The I.R.S. data, however, cover only the limited category of sole proprietorships, or Schedule C businesses, and not another type, known as Subchapter S corporations, which are often used by doctors, lawyers and other professionals.
The latest I.R.S. report shows that in 1995 the number of Schedule C's -- the Federal income tax form used by most home-based businesses -- was 16.4 million, up 11 percent from 1990. These sole proprietorships had net income of $169.3 billion in 1995, up nearly 20 percent from 1990. The average proprietorship took in more than $10,000.
Meanwhile, the number of Subchapter S corporations rose more than 13 percent from 1992 to 1994 and revenue nearly doubled from $46.2 billion to $96.1 billion.
How many home-based businesses evade the taxman's gaze, however, is a big unknown. Because many home-based businesses are paid in cash, or by customers who are not required to report the transactions to the Government, many of these businesses operate under the Government's tax radar.
When they do find home-based businesses, municipal tax officials say, the owners often resist submitting to regulation, licensing and taxing out of a mistaken belief that they are exempt from rules that apply to all business.
"People who work out of their homes think they aren't required to have business licenses," said Marsha Compton Fielder, the revenue commissioner for Roanoke, Va. She started to recount the abusive responses of some people who are told to get a license, but then paused and said, "Some are nicer than others."
The most widely known fight against such municipal licensing is taking place in Los Angeles, where lawsuits have been brought against the city by a group of screenwriters. Earlier this year the City Council changed the zoning ordinance, which had prohibited nearly all home-based businesses, to allow those that are quiet and operate indoors.
The Screenwriters Guild and some journalists' organizations contend that the city is trying to license writers, in violation of the First Amendment. The screenwriters also contend that the city cannot tax them on revenue from their creative work.
The tax, while small, could have a significant impact on some successful freelancers. Los Angeles wants to impose a tax, for instance, of $5,900 on a $1 million payment for a screenplay.
"People believe there is an escape mechanism for them," said Larry Brockman, the president of the American Home Business Association, a Salt Lake City marketing company that operates seminars and sells services to people who want to set up their own businesses at home.
"We tell people that they have to conform, have to get business licenses," Mr. Brockman said, "but the deeper symptom is that Americans are angry about the taxes they pay and so they make themselves believe that they are exempt. But of course, they are not."
Mr. Jensen, the Tacoma tax official, said he was not surprised that efforts to collect a tax on long-established but untaxed business activity provoked litigation.
"The key is to build a tax into the trend early, rather than trying to apply a tax later when there will be much more resistance," he said.
The overall licensing and taxing policies of Los Angeles are driving people in creative businesses, especially those connected to software and the Internet, into the suburbs around Los Angeles, said Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy in Malibu, Calif.
Communities surrounding Los Angeles, like Culver City and Burbank, "have thriving Information Age economies because they do not behave like the City of Los Angeles, a metropolitan area which has more writers than any other place in the world," Mr. Kotkin said.
Judy Carter, a comedy writer, said that to avoid the tax, she promised the city she would write her jokes in her second home, in Big Bear, Calif. "Officially," she said, "I'm not funny in Los Angeles."
Raising taxes, but not enough so that home-business owners are tempted to move, drives the policies of many cities. One subtle way to raise a little extra money, as Tacoma has found, is to impose multiple taxes at very low rates.
While the Comroes must have two licenses for their clock business, their friends, Woodroe and Marjorie Grinstead had to pay for three. The Grinsteads' Action Cycles, a motorcycle engine rebuilding business that they run in a shop behind their home, requires a general business licese, a home-business license and a speciality license for garages. They pay the minimum for all three licenses, a total of $172 a year.
"The principle the city follows," Mrs. Grinstead said, "seems to be to tax the little businesses because they are the least equipped to fight back."
Fees like those imposed in Tacoma, said Paul Reynolds, a business professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., "aren't going to make any difference to how many people start businesses or succeed in them."
"What these business owners do want," added Professor Reynolds, who has studied small businesses for 15 years, "is simplicity and not having to take a lot of time from what they are doing and waste it on compliance with tax laws."
Teri Comroe, the clock repair owner, agreed: "Fighting the city over $50 a year isn't worth our time."

HEADLINE: A Good Month For Trade, With Trouble Ahead

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
In a surprisingly large decline, the monthly trade deficit narrowed to $9.7 billion for October as exports reached record levels, the Commerce Department reported today. Analysts said, however, that they expected the gap to widen considerably in future months as Asian economic trouble squeezed exports and created cheaper imports.
The trade figures, which are published with longer delays than most other economic data, did show that the monthly imbalance with Japan surged to its highest level in October in two and a half years. But the deficit with China shrank, as did the trade gap with South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. 
 "Anyone hoping to find effects of the recent financial turmoil in East Asia in today's trade numbers should recognize the lags involved," said Lee Price, Acting Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs. "Today's data report the goods and services that crossed our border in October. Most of the business decisions to commit to those transactions had taken place several months before October."
The month's figures did suggest, analysts said, that trade -- a significant drag on economic growth earlier in the year -- would not be so this quarter. As a result, Kenneth T. Mayland, chief economist of Keycorp, said growth could equal the 3.3 percent annual pace of both the spring and summer, which some consider too fast to sustain without a pickup in inflation.
"A lot of trade is contractual," Mr. Mayland said, in contending that Asian turmoil would not make a big impact on American trade flows for a few more months. Currency devaluations and other spurs to exports from the Far East operate "with some pretty long lags," he said.
"The crisis in Asia is not yet reflected in U.S. trade statistics," Stan Shipley, a senior Merrill Lynch economist, told clients. "We expect an ever-enlarging trade deficit in the first half of 1998 as U.S. exports to Asia decline."
Yet October was better than expected, with the overall trade deficit falling from a revised figure for September of $11.228 billion.
The amount by which American imports exceeded sales abroad ran at an annual pace of $114 billion for the first 10 months of the year, compared with $111 billion in the comparable months of 1996.
Exports in October rose 2.4 percent, to $80 billion, in a broad advance paced by motor vehicles and capital goods, the report showed.
Ranking officials of the Clinton Administration, which has kept trying to break down barriers to American products and is mindful of the reduced ability of Asians to buy them, reacted cautiously.
"A single month of good news must not distract us from our commitment to building our exports," Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley said in a statement.
On Capitol Hill, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, urged the Agriculture Department to use export incentives to prevent losses of wheat sales to Asia.
Imports in October rose a modest four-tenths of 1 percent, to $89.7 billion, with crude oil and capital goods the biggest factors.
The deficit with Japan jumped $800 million, to bring the total for September and October to $1.4 billion, with half the latest rise accounted for by motor vehicles.
But the deficit with China, which has alternated with Japan as the largest source of the American trade gap, narrowed to $5.2 billion from $5.5 billion.
The China imbalance was a record in September. The Japanese deficit in October was the highest since April 1995.
And after doubling in September, the combined deficit with South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong dropped $500 million in October, to $1.5 billion. The deficit with other Pacific Rim countries, including Indonesia, fell to $1.3 billion from $2 billion.
The $9.7 billion imbalance over all reflected a $17.1 billion deficit in goods, offset by the usual American surplus in services -- insurance, tourism and the like -- which in October amounted to $7.4 billion.
The nation's surplus in advanced technology products rose $200 million in October, to $1.6 billion.

HEADLINE: With Approving Nod, I.M.F. Wires $3.5 Billion to South Korea

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund released a further $3.5 billion tonight of the $21 billion it has pledged to keep South Korea afloat, giving its approval to Seoul's handling of the crisis so far and a vote of confidence to the President-elect, Kim Dae Jung.
Officials at the fund insisted that the decision was ordained by a bureaucratic timetable and was not designed to make a political point. But they were clearly aware that the announcement would help reassure jittery investors and lenders wondering whether the new government will be able to keep the nation on a recovery path. 
 Saying he had a sense of "cautious optimism" about South Korea's prospects, Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, said Seoul had exceeded the requirements of the bailout package, so far, by opening up its financial markets and cleaning up its banking system.
The fund, Mr. Camdessus said, "is satisfied with the way in which the program has been not only maintained but developed and strengthened" by the government of Kim Young Sam, the outgoing President.
Mr. Camdessus said he believed that Korea's new President and his defeated rivals in the election would honor their public commitments to continue with the politically and economically painful steps necessary to restore confidence in South Korea's financial condition.
The $3.5 billion payment, which will be wired to South Korea by the central banks of the fund's member countries over the next day or two, is the second installment of the I.M.F. package. It follows a disbursement of $5.5 billion two weeks ago.
Investors remain concerned about whether South Korea has turned the corner, and some analysts say they are not yet convinced that the new President will keep his promises to stick to the I.M.F. austerity plan.
Mr. Camdessus said the fund had found no areas in which Korea was not meeting its commitments. Moreover, he said, the Government had taken several steps not specifically mandated by the plan, including its decision this week to allow the currency, the won, to fluctuate in value in response to market forces. He also cited the Government's willingness to raise interest rates more than the plan required and to close more of its ailing merchant banks than the fund called for.
The disbursement approved today was the first under a new formula developed under prodding by the United States, which would have the fund move more aggressively to make loans to nations suffering from acute problems in the financial markets. The policy favors larger loans from the I.M.F. in a shorter time during periods of market crisis, but those loans would carry higher interest rates and shorter repayment periods than traditional I.M.F. assistance.

HEADLINE: Release of Tobacco Memos Brings Lawmakers' Demand for More

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
A new debate over proposed Federal tobacco legislation erupted in Congress yesterday after the release of hundreds of cigarette company documents showing how industry lawyers steered scientific research away from efforts to connect smoking and diseases like cancer.
The more than 800 previously secret documents, released yesterday by the House Commerce Committee, paint a portrait of cigarette industry lawyers working together for decades to generate research to play down the risks of smoking. In one 1968 memorandum, lawyers discussed a strategy to "research the disease" rather than "questions more directly related to tobacco." And two decades later they followed the same tack, by proposing studies that would not identify health problems posed by second-hand smoke but research "their real causes," according to a 1987 memorandum from the Tobacco Institute, a trade group. 
 "As an example, we might envision case studies of two groups of children with and without excessive respiratory problems or developmental retardation, and then study a wide range of hereditary, environmental, economic and social factors which may differentiate them," the memorandum states.
The 834 documents come from the files of the Liggett Group, a cigarette producer that is a subsidiary of the Brooke Group Ltd., and reflect communications between lawyers from other tobacco companies. Legal experts said yesterday that they had been able to read only some of the documents but that they appeared to fill in details about the inner workings of the tobacco industry rather than break new ground.
The documents' disclosure, however, coupled with the earlier release of court papers in Minnesota, produced demands by Democrats and at least one Republican that tobacco companies disgorge thousands of other documents before Congress considers the $368.5 billion settlement proposal reached in June between producers and state attorneys general.
For example, Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who heads the Senate Commerce Committee, which will play a major role in any Federal tobacco legislation, said he would seek far more secret documents than those released yesterday.
"The released papers are but a small fraction of the relevant documentation," Mr. McCain said in a statement. "Without such sunlight and disclosures we can't make informed decisions."
One longtime opponent of the industry, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, said that in light of the Liggett documents, it would be difficult for Congress to give tobacco companies the immunity from lawsuits and punitive damages they are seeking under Federal legislation.
In a statement, four cigarette producers involved in the June settlement proposal sought to play down the significance of the documents and insisted that Federal tobacco legislation was the only way to resolve a number of regulatory and legal issues involving the product.
"Those who believe that 20- or 40-year-old documents merit continuation of legal and regulatory hostilities in lieu of a national legislative solution fail to see what is at stake," said the companies in a joint statement. "We must learn from, but not be obsessed by, events past."
The statement was put out by the Philip Morris Companies, the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation., the parent of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, B.A.T. Industries P.L.C., the parent of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, and Loews Corporation, the parent of Lorillard Tobacco Company. Another company, U.S.T. Inc., a producer of smokeless tobacco, was also involved in the June agreement but none of its documents were at issue yesterday.
All of the companies had sought to prevent disclosure of the Liggett documents, which are part of a lawsuit filed against them by Minnesota state officials, arguing that they were protected by attorney-client privilege. But the records, which were found by the Minnesota court to contain evidence of crimes and fraud, were subpoenaed this month by Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., the Virginia Republican who heads the Commerce Committee, which released them yesterday.
Previously disclosed tobacco industry records have shown that cigarette lawyers were involved in selecting research projects that were not designed to find ties between smoking and cancer. And legal experts believe that far more important documents that are part of the Minnesota lawsuit, those from the files of industry giants like Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds, remain to be disclosed.
But taken together, the Liggett documents provide new details about the degree to which lawyers were involved in directing health research. The documents also show that while cigarette producers publicly stated over decades that they were seriously investigating smoking risks, they were often casting blame for diseases like lung cancer and heart disease on other causes.
At times, the research underwritten by industry lawyers bordered on the absurd. In 1966, for example, they considered financing a study that would try to find high cancer rates not related to smoking in then-polluted areas like Pittsburgh, a document shows. A companion study would have looked for pockets of low cancer incidence not corresponding to smoking based on a survey of desert populations.
A 1967 document also suggested using groups popular among young people, like the rock group the Monkees, as industry spokesmen.
But within the industry, cigarette company officials were acknowledging smoking risks, previously disclosed documents show. On Tuesday, for example, Kenneth J. Fitzpatrick, a Minnesota state judge who is overseeing the state's lawsuit there, ruled that the Liggett documents showed that cigarette companies and their lawyers engaged in a long-running "conspiracy of silence and suppression of scientific research" about the dangers of smoking.
Industry lawyers also put forward experts who they thought would raise doubts about ties between smoking and disease. In a 1971 memorandum, lawyers from Shook, Hardy & Bacon, perhaps the tobacco industry's top law firm, proposed paying $70,000 to a scientist who, they noted, was "convinced that smoking has been given far too much consideration and air pollution too little."
The extent to which tobacco lawyers were involved in selecting research disturbed even some of them, according to a 1981 memorandum. At a meeting of industry lawyers, one lawyer noted they were making "advocacy primary and research secondary." Another lawyer apparently discussed hiding research from regulators at the Federal Trade Commission by claiming it was protected under the attorney-client privilege, the document indicates.
"We wanted to protect it under the lawyers," that lawyer remarked at the time. "We did not want it out in the open."
In 1983, top industry lawyers at the Tobacco Institute in Washington discussed withholding information from legislators who were debating the Drug Abuse Act on the grounds that contributing material to an addiction study was risky if the report reached a "conclusion or conclusions unfavorable to industry.
Other Liggett documents indicate that cigarette companies in the 1960's monitored the number of children who were watching their advertisements on television.
Other documents show that as recently as 1990, industry lawyers were commissioning studies to monitor cancer rates among ethnic groups.
Under a proposed settlement reached in June between the tobacco industry and state attorneys general, producers agreed, among other things, to pay $368.5 billion to settle smoking-related lawsuits.
In return, the proposal would protect the companies against most lawsuits and bar juries from awarding punitive damages.

HEADLINE: DECISION ON BOSNIA: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Calls for Keeping Troops In Bosnia With No New Exit Date

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Abandoning his June deadline for withdrawing American forces from Bosnia, President Clinton called today for an open-ended commitment of troops in the international peacekeeping mission, arguing that it is helping to rebuild that nation's roads, schools, economy and political system.
Mr. Clinton denied Republican accusations that he and his aides had misled Congress in saying they would meet the June exit deadline. 
 Responding to questions after his announcement at the White House this morning, Mr. Clinton instead made an unusually direct admission of error, saying that he had simply been wrong.
"I wasn't right, which is why I don't want to make that error again," he said.
Mr. Clinton added: "I don't mind taking a hit for being wrong about the timetable. But after the hit is dished out, I would like the larger truth looked at."
That truth, the President said, is that the mission had enforced a fragile cease-fire, had advanced American security and values, and was making it less likely that the United States would "be drawn into some other conflict in Europe 10, 20, 30 years from now where the costs could be far greater." Transcript, page A20.
Mr. Clinton said that he expected American troops to leave Bosnia in the "near term," but he refused to set a new exit date, saying that the mission, which is led by NATO, should instead be defined by "concrete benchmarks," like the creation of an adequate civilian police force.
"I am not suggesting a permanent presence in Bosnia," the President said, in his most detailed comments on Bosnia since his re-election a year ago. "I am suggesting that it's a more honest thing to do to say what our objectives are."
He did not specify the size of the force after June, but said he hoped it would be smaller than the 8,500 Americans who are there now, as part of a NATO-led force of more than 30,000.
Congress's only avenue to block the extension of the mission is the politically unappealing one of cutting off money to the American troops in Bosnia. While they expressed irritation with the Administration's broken deadlines -- Mr. Clinton has now extended the mission twice -- and its still-undefined strategy, Republicans in Congress said they were unlikely to take that step. Mr. Clinton's admission of error appeared to be intended to blunt their anger.
Some said that they were waiting for the President to fill in the details. Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican and member of the Foreign Relations Committee, warned that if Mr. Clinton failed to lay out a "crystal-clear exit strategy," he would "work aggressively with other members of Congress to insure the safe return home of U.S. troops." But he did not specify how.
The announcement today had been previewed for weeks in comments by the President's national security aides. Critics of the Administration's Bosnia policy said that the decision to abandon deadlines for withdrawing the troops -- coming as it does seven months before the expiration of the current mission -- demonstrated an improved appreciation of how to enlist Congressional support. They said that it could also help military and civilian planners by better focusing the mission.
"Focusing on goals rather than dates is a big step forward, and it reflects a better understanding in the Administration on how to deal with Congress," said Stephen W. Walker, the director of the Balkan Institute here. Mr. Walker, a former foreign service officer who quit the State Department in 1993 over Bosnia policy, added that "it remains to be seen whether the Administration is going to back up its improved rhetoric with real action."
In applauding Mr. Clinton's announcement, Rep. Lee Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who is the ranking minority member of the House Committee on International Relations, said that it would shift the domestic debate away from the narrow question of meeting deadlines.
"There will be more attention to the so-called exit strategy," he said, "not in terms of a date certain, but more about the conditions that need to exist before we pull out."
The President is planning to leave Sunday on a holiday visit to the troops in Bosnia. He is taking a Congressional delegation that includes opponents of his policy.
While he committed troops "in principle" today, Mr. Clinton laid out six conditions, including clearly defined benchmarks, for American participation in the NATO force past June.
He said that United States must retain command of the mission and that European nations "must assume their share of responsibility."
He also said that the plan "must have substantial support from Congress and the American people."
Mr. Clinton did not define a new mission for the troops. That issue, together with the size of the force, is being debated within the Administration and NATO, with an announcement likely in mid-January.
The number of American troops has already declined from its height of 27,000 in 1996. It may fall still more, to perhaps 6,000, though some Administration officials worry that cuts in the force could hamper, and as a result prolong, its mission.
The first benchmark that the President said should determine the success of the NATO mission is that the joint political institutions created to unify Bosnia must be strong enough "to be self-sustaining after the military operation."
He also said that the political parties there must give up control of the media, which he called "instruments of hate and venom." He called for an adequate police force, and he said that the NATO allies should be confident that the military was under democratic rule.
The President said that he did not entertain utopian visions of creating racial comity in Bosnia. "I don't think it's necessary for us to stay until everybody wants to go have tea together at 4 in the afternoon in a civil environment," he said.
Despite efforts to create a unified government, Bosnia remains split along ethnic lines, without a common flag or an integrated postal service.
The Dayton accords, which ended the war in 1995, were intended to reunify Bosnia but have, in a sense, ratified the boundaries that separated the ethnic groups when the three years of fighting stopped. But the Administration rejects the idea of partitioning Bosnia.
"It would sanction the horrors of ethnic cleansing and send the wrong signal to extremists everywhere," Mr. Clinton said.
Although Mr. Clinton said that his list of benchmarks for the military force was not complete, he disappointed some Bosnia experts by failing to include the return of refugees or the arrest of people indicted for war crimes.
Referring to those two subjects, one senior Administration official said later: "I don't think there's any doubt that, when the final list of benchmarks comes up, they absolutely will be part of it."
But Mr. Clinton said that it might not be necessary to arrest the most prominent suspect, Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb president who remains a powerful nationalist leader. "If he flees the country, if he is deep enough underground, if he can't have any impact on it, we might make the peace work anyway," he said.
Mr. Clinton said that the United States had supported a Dutch-led NATO mission this morning that resulted in the arrest of two Bosnian Croats indicted for atrocities.
The President also praised efforts to return refugees, saying that NATO's success in creating a secure environment had encouraged 350,000 people to return home, out of some 2 million who left the country or fled elsewhere within Bosnia.
Mr. Clinton sketched a portrait today of a recovering Bosnia, where NATO troops had helped separate armies, demobilize 350,000 troops, patch roads and restore electricity, change the media "from an instrument of war into a force for peace," and create a presidency, parliament, and supreme court. "The progress is unmistakable," he said. "But it is not yet irreversible."

HEADLINE: Revision of Earnings Forecasts Sends Dow Lower

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
At the end of November -- even after the stock market's plunge in October and the spread of financial turmoil throughout Asia -- stock analysts were buoyant.
At Merrill Lynch, the company analysts set a record by raising earnings forecasts for 105 more companies than were downgraded in the three months ended in November. 
 It is that kind of optimism that has set up investors and strategists alike for the earnings disappointments in the last two weeks that have sent stocks lower.
The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled yesterday for a second consecutive session, ending down 110.91 points, or 1.4 percent, at 7,846.50.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index continued to outdo the Dow on the downside, falling 24.18 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,523.19. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 10.24 points, or 1.1 percent, to 955.30.
Aetna Inc. dropped 9 3/8, to 69 1/2, after the abrupt departure of a top financial executive suggested that the company might have trouble meeting its earnings estimates. The Plexus Corporation, an electronics company, announced that its earnings would fall short of expectations because customers were delaying orders. Its shares fell 11, or 44 percent, to 14.
And the regulars -- the stocks that have bounced up and down recently as earnings fears waxed and waned -- fell again. J. P. Morgan led the Dow lower, falling 3 1/8, to 118 7/8, and Caterpillar dropped 2, to 48 11/16.
On Wednesday, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing set the negative earnings tone by announcing that its fourth-quarter earnings would fall 10 percent short of its forecast. Its shares plunged almost 10 percent on Wednesday but rose 11/16 yesterday, to 85 15/16. Last week, Oracle raised the earnings caution flag, and its shares dropped 29 percent. They fell 5/8 yesterday, to 22.
Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers, said there was a wide gap developing between current expectations and the revisions that strategists are working on because of the economic drag from Asia and the slower growth expected in the United States in 1998.
Current estimates for 1998 put earnings growth at 13 percent for the companies in the S.& P. 500, but Mr. Applegate said that Lehman Brothers would scale down its forecast to 8 percent if the economic growth rate in Asia fell to zero next year.
"There is a pretty big distance between 13 and 8," he said, adding that there is a risk of the market going lower.
Earnings worries often arise at the end of a quarter because that is when companies begin trying to ease investor expectations.
But adding to the negative atmosphere is the string of 1998 stock market forecasts coming out, many of which are bearish. And while all of the bearish to neutral forecasts for this year have turned out to be wrong, many investors and analysts are skeptical that the stock market can do that well next year.
One of the stock market's better known bulls, Ralph J. Acampora, the director of technical research at Prudential Securities, who had forecast a Dow of 10,000 by June 1998, said yesterday that he had put that forecast on hold until 1999. He now predicts that the Dow will trade between 6,000 and 8,600 in 1998 and thinks that three-quarters of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange could decline by 20 percent.
Barton Biggs, the global strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company, said that investors were underestimating the economic effect of the turmoil in Asia and the rising dollar and that both the United States and Europe were likely to experience bear markets next year. But Mr. Biggs has been bearish before and been forced to throw in the towel as the stock market stormed ahead.
Richard Bernstein, the director of quantitative research at Merrill Lynch, said that he expected the pre-announcements of earnings to depress sentiment. But he thinks that when actual fourth-quarter earnings reports come in at the beginning of next year, they may not turn out to be as bad as expected. But then just as investors are brushing off the Asian effect, he expects the bad news to become apparent as the full force of the Asian drag hits and the American economy slows.
In robust trading yesterday, almost two stocks fell for every one that rose. Microsoft was buffeted again in its antitrust battle with the Justice Department and finished at 130 7/8, down 4 3/4. One of the rising stocks was Eastman Kodak, which climbed 1 1/2, to 58, after announcing additional job cuts.

Shares of Aetna fell more than 10 percent after the company announced the departure of the chief financial officer of its health care unit. Aetna officials spoke with analysts but provided few details. 
 Analysts speculated that the resignation signaled bigger problems at the company than had earlier been anticipated and that more negative earnings news might be ahead. Aetna, which acquired U.S. Healthcare, is struggling with melding that operation into its operation. Page D2.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Legislature Votes to Double State Cigarette Tax

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The New Jersey Legislature voted overwhelmingly today to increase the state's cigarette tax by 40 cents a pack, making cigarettes more expensive in New Jersey than in any other state in the region. The proceeds, about $205 million a year, will help pay for hospital treatment for uninsured patients and for school construction.
Both Republicans and Democrats offered unflinching support for the tax increase to 80 cents a pack, saying that they hoped it would curtail smoking, especially among teen-agers. The Senate voted 33-6 to adopt the proposal, while the General Assembly approved it 58-18. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman is expected to sign the bill into law, and the increase would take effect on Jan. 1. 
 New Jersey is the 10th state to raise its cigarette tax this year, and the increase, which doubles the tax, is among the steepest. The state will now have the third-highest cigarette tax in the nation, after Alaska, which increased its cigarette tax this year to $1 from 29 cents, and Washington State, at 82.5 cents. In comparison, New York's tax is 56 cents a pack, and Connecticut's is 31 cents.
Lawmakers said they supported the tax increase -- the most significant in New Jersey since former Gov. Jim Florio raised taxes by $2.8 billion in 1990 -- partly because they believed it would decrease smoking.
"If increasing the tax on cigarettes helps discourage people from smoking, it's fine with an overwhelming number of New Jerseyans," said State Senator Richard J. Codey, the minority leader and a Democrat of Essex County.
To complaints that the tax would hit poor smokers unfairly, Senator C. Louis Bassano, Republican of Union, replied: "So quit smoking. That's the whole point."
But even as lawmakers fiercely defended the tax increase, about a dozen smokers said in interviews that it would not make them quit. Most said they would simply pay the higher price in local stores, and a few said they would buy cigarettes in neighboring states. A pack of cigarettes cost about $2.23 in New York last year, $1.77 in Pennsylvania and $1.72 in Delaware, according to the Tobacco Institute, an industry lobbying group in Washington. After the tax increase, cigarettes will cost an average of $2.75 per pack in New Jersey, the institute said.
Anti-smoking advocates said that the broad bipartisan support for cigarette tax increases in New Jersey and other states this year reflects a changing attitude toward the tobacco industry, which donates millions of dollars to political campaigns. They said politicians had become more willing to pass laws that discourage or restrict smoking because of increasing evidence that the industry had long known its products were addictive and had deliberately marketed them to teen-agers.
Mrs. Whitman and legislative leaders have pushed for a cigarette tax increase several times before, but they could never gather enough support. The Legislature has avoided raising any tax since 1990 because the Florio package, which included income and sales tax increases and a 19-cent rise in the cigarette tax, cost many lawmakers -- and ultimately Mr. Florio -- their jobs.
Legislators were far more willing to support a tax increase this time because both teacher unions and the health-care industry were lobbying for it. While most of the revenue will go toward hospital care for the uninsured, 10 cents per pack -- or $50 million a year -- will go toward school construction.
"What put it over the top this time was this masterful combination of these two issues, education and health care," said Curtis Fisher, director of New Jersey Public Interest Research Group Citizen Lobby. "It's probably the most palatable tax increase that exists right now, and you have two significant lobbies crying out for it."
Pete McDonough, a spokesman for Mrs. Whitman, said the Governor was happy about the tax increase, which covers all tobacco products, and he pointed out that she had cut taxes by $4.4 billion during her first term. "She didn't resist this one," Mr. McDonough said. "It's a very narrow tax increase for two very specific problems."
But in interviews this morning, people buying cigarettes in Sayreville, a working-class town in Middlesex County, said they felt unfairly singled out. They said that the new tax would not stop them from smoking, and that every resident of New Jersey should chip in to pay for charity care.
Steve Petner, a technician for a pharmaceutical company who spends at least $20 a week on cigarettes, said he would rather see tobacco companies pay the extra tax.
"You have people who need to keep smoking because they're addicted, and they're going to be forced to spend all this extra money," said Mr. Petner, 46, who has smoked for 29 years. "I can handle it, but I'd like to stop being treated as a second-class citizen."
Meanwhile, owners of convenience stores in Sayreville predicted that the new 80-cent tax would hurt cigarette sales, which they said make up about 30 percent of their business.
"People already complain about the price in New Jersey," said Umesh Patel, manager of the Krauszer's convenient store, who predicted his cigarette sales would drop by as much as 20 percent. "Now they're going to go from town to town, state to state, looking for the cheapest cigarettes."
The legislation approved today will give hospitals $320 million a year to treat the uninsured. Of that, $155 million will come from the cigarette tax, with the rest coming from the state's unemployment fund and the general budget. Urban hospitals will get another $101.5 million to treat hundreds of patients with AIDS and tuberculosis. The new plan will also provide $68 million for two separate health insurance programs, including one for uninsured children and another for people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but whose employers offer no health coverage.
The state's current financing system for charity care expires on Dec. 31. Until 1992, charity care was funded by a surcharge on hospital bills; since then, most of the money has come from the state's unemployment insurance fund, a practice that has been harshly criticized by business and labor leaders. That fund is still being tapped to pay for charity care under today's legislation, but its use is to be phased out over five years.
Although legislators have proposed many bills that would discourage or restrict smoking in New Jersey in recent years, most have never come up for a vote, Mr. Fisher said. While New York City and dozens of states have restricted smoking in restaurants or banned it altogether, New Jersey requires only that restaurants post a sign in the window telling patrons whether there are tables for nonsmokers.
Lawmakers proposed banning smoking in day-care centers, restaurants and shopping malls this year, but none of the bills got past legislative committees.
Mr. Fisher said he hoped the strong support for the cigarette tax increase would encourage the Legislature to restrict indoor smoking and advertising by cigarette companies.
"There are critical issues that need to be addressed," he said. "Hopefully, this will open the door."
In Sayreville this morning, one longtime smoker said the higher tax would help him kick the habit. Chris Nogueras, 26, said that he had already made a halfhearted resolution to quit smoking on New Year's Day, and that the prospect of paying an extra 40 cents a pack hardened his resolve.
"It's the best excuse I've heard," Mr. Nogueras said. "Come New Year's, I'll be ready to stop."

HEADLINE: School Tax Law Splits 'Haves' and 'Have Nots'

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: STOWE, Vt.

 BODY:
Vermont these days is riven by revolution.
Not in a way that visitors to this white-steepled ski town would notice. The snow is deep and sugary this year, the lift lines are long and the torchlight parades march glowingly on. 
 But if, one recent morning, those visitors had stepped off the Currier-and-Ives street and into the Town Hall auditorium -- where the year-round residents gather -- they would have heard voices protesting the pain of sweeping social change.
They would have heard the likes of Alvin Schein, a retired dentist: "People say, 'Now it's your turn to suffer!' And I say, 'Two wrongs don't make a right!' " And John Steel, a house-builder: "We used to be called a ski town. Now we're called a 'gold town.' They're driving a wedge from town to town." And Frank Talarico, a businessman: "It's the haves and the have-nots. I'm dismayed to see this happening in Vermont."
The source of all this agonizing is what many consider the hottest, most divisive political issue to hit Vermont in many years -- an innovative setup for financing the state's schools called Act 60.
The new law is meant to address a knotty problem that has confronted more than half the states since 1971. At issue is this fundamental question: Should a richer community -- called 'gold towns' in this debate -- with the resources to spend more on its pupils have the right to do so? Or is public education such a basic right that the state must make sure access to it is equal for all?
Beginning in California in 1971, more than 30 states have fought court battles over whether the system of supporting schools from local property taxes was constitutional. Though courts have split evenly in their decisions, experts say the trend is decidedly against local taxing and in favor of equalization. Most recently, in a decision that sent shivers of dread through tax-hating New Hampshire, the state's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that its dependence on local property taxes for nearly 90 percent of its school budgets was unconstitutional.
State responses to such rulings have varied greatly, said Mary Fulton, an expert on school financing at the Education Commission of the States, an advisory group. Some, like New Jersey, have struggled for years without coming up with a workable alternative to local property tax. Only Kansas and now Vermont have promptly passed broad statewide property taxes in response, she said.
Court challenges to school financing systems are currently pending in 15 states, including New York and New Jersey, according to the commission.
Gov. Howard Dean in Vermont said of such court decisions: "The obvious remedy is a statewide property tax. But it's a very difficult thing to do. It's very controversial, and it's been controversial here." In effect, Act 60 says public schools in towns that are rich in property -- like Stowe -- can no longer benefit directly from that wealth; most school money is to come from a statewide property tax rather than a local one, and the tax wealth of the property-rich towns will largely be pooled among schools around the state.
Residents in gold towns, the term for property-rich towns that has arisen during the Act 60 debates, are unhappy, Dr. Dean said, but "they've been essentially driving a Cadillac and paying a Chevy lease price."
"What the court did," he said, "is say that the property-tax base, for the purposes of education, belongs to every child in the state, not just the children in special towns."
The Vermont court ruling came in February. It noted that the tax base and school spending varied wildly from town to town. Richford, for example, had a property tax base of only $140,000 a student in fiscal 1995 and spent only $3,743 a pupil on average, it said, while Peru had a tax base of $2.2 million a student and spent $6,476 on each.
By June, the state legislature, newly dominated by an across-the-board Democratic majority and ready to heed voters' clamor for cuts in property taxes, had passed Act 60.
The law, which also shifts some of the tax burden from the property tax to others, like those on gasoline and hotel rooms, will be phased in beginning next fall.
But its effect is already clear. In 220 Vermont towns, property taxes will drop. But in 40 gold towns, which are largely ski areas and tourist spots with many second homes, property taxes will rise and school budgets will likely shrink.
There is another novel aspect of Act 60: "As far as we can tell, this is the first property tax to be income-based," said State Senator Cheryl Rivers of Stockbridge, a Morgan horse breeder and adroit Act 60 explicator (which is no mean talent with a law so complex that Ms. Rivers compared it to an automatic transmission: you know it works, but not how).
The law puts on cap on the amount of property tax households that earn less than $75,000 -- that is, about 90 percent of Vermont households -- can pay. Most of these households will pay no more than 2 or 3 percent of their adjusted gross income, depending on the town.
The law is also not quite a blanket an equalizer since towns can still vote to spend more than others on their schools.
But when they vote to raise their local taxes, some of that extra money, too, is pooled so as to make equal spending by towns result in equal tax rates. And in gold towns that stand to lose under Act 60, the question of whether to raise local taxes just to keep school budgets level is a thorny one.
In Stowe, for example, some parents worry that taxpayers without many school-age children will not agree to the nearly 40 percent tax hike that would be required to maintain the current budget of the town's excellent school system. Furthermore, businesses are not allowed the same income-based cap as households and might not be happy about big increases for education.
In the current backlash against Act 60, residents from the 40 towns hurt by the law have banded together into a group called Parents for Quality Education that is raising court challenges and trying to influence public opinion. They calculate that the law will hurt 10,000 Vermont schoolchildren out of a total of 105,000, and complain that its equalizing effect will replace excellence with mediocrity.
Some economists, too, question whether centralizing school financing make sense. It is not clear, said William A. Fischel, an economics professor at Dartmouth College and critic of Act 60, that reducing local control over schools helps even the children in property-poor areas as overall support often goes down.
"In some places, certainly in California and in some other places, this has made people at the low end worse off," he said. "It's dog-in-a-manger equality."
But equality is a powerful concept here. At a recent State House round-table discussion about the transition to Act 60, parents who complained that budget cuts would hurt their children's education got little sympathy from parents whose towns have had lower budgets all along.
"We have to talk about the rights of children in this state to equal access to educational opportunity instead of the claims of some towns to advantages to which they've become accustomed," exclaimed Allen Gilbert, from the town of Worcester.
Act 60 has provoked such emotion that some Vermonters say they are appalled at the resentment and envy.
"This is a poor state," said Louis Costanza, a retiree from Long Island who expects the property tax on his three-bedroom house in Winhall to go from $800 to $6,000 a year. "They see the Mercedes and Land Rovers and Wagoneers and say: 'Those yuppies have a lot of money. How am I going to get it? They've been dreaming about this for a long time.' "
The rancor has come to the surface in furious political debates and even in unaccustomed friction between neighbors.
Cameron Page, a Stowe mother and school board member, got a bewildering blast of anti-gold-town sentiment at a recent hockey game. A woman from a neighboring, non-gold town who was sitting near her, Ms. Page said, "actually leaned over to me and said, 'Nyeh, Nyeh.' "

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
On John St., From Offices to Housing

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Five short blocks along John Street in the Manhattan financial district have become a focus for converting old office buildings to housing.
Work is under way or will soon begin at six sites totaling 1,459 apartments in the corridor between Water Street and Broadway. After the pattern of downtown conversions, most buildings will be converted into rentals, ranging from six lofts at 41 John Street to 576 units at 127 John Street, also known as 200 Water Street. 
 One building, 17 John Street, will become a 58-unit loft condominium. It is among the first condo conversions to be announced downtown, where experts expect 7,000 residences to be created by 2002 with the help of city-sponsored tax incentives, according to the Alliance for Downtown Manhattan, a business improvement district.
In the two years since conversions began, 2,382 units have been completed or are under construction, and an additional 1,100 are to start early next year, said the president of the district, Carl Weisbrod.
Nancy Packes, who heads Feathered Nest, a rental brokerage, said downtown could absorb additional rentals, because demand continues to outstrip supply. Although rental projects are planned throughout Manhattan, the level is not close to the 13,000 units built yearly in the 1980's, Ms. Packes said. Because the recession, and not a glut of units, affected prices then, she added, "there is no reason to believe we are anywhere near producing enough units to cause prices to decline, though the rate of increases may slow."
Annual rents downtown are $32 to $35 a square foot, Ms. Packes said, noting that they are 15 percent below rents in more established neighborhoods.
Mr. Weisbrod said John Street caught developers' attention, even though it is not adjacent to an established residential area, because empty or near-empty buildings were available at low prices.
Several developers said many of the buildings were old with small interior spaces, making them easy to carve up into apartments.
John Street was once considered insurance row. The area fell on hard times sooner than other parts of downtown, as many insurers moved operations to less expensive areas outside Manhattan. Then the recession hit, and more tenants left.
The Rockrose Development Corporation initiated the march to John Street in 1995 with its purchase of No. 127. "It was perfect for conversion, because it is on the doorstep of the South Street Seaport and offers magnificent bridge and river views," said Kevin P. Singleton, vice president at Rockrose.
The company is converting the 32-story tower to 576 rentals, from studios to three-bedroom units, with 500 to 1,600 square feet of space each. Leasing is to begin in April, with occupancy to start in June.
Also in the spring, Rockrose will begin renovating 99 John Street into 453 apartments, after the American Insurance Group leaves.
The rents at both sites have not been set, Mr. Singleton said, but he expects them to be comparable to or higher than those at 45 Wall Street, which Rockrose also converted. The 435 studio to three-bedroom units in that building rented for $1,400 to $4,200 a month.
At 80 John Street, leasing began in September, and half of its 147 studio to three-bedroom apartments and lofts have been leased, said Fredric I. Oliver. He is a partner of WSA Equities L.L.C. in Garden City, N.Y., which owns the 24-story building where the Travelers Insurance Company had been a tenant. Rents for the 900- to 1,300-square-foot units are $1,700 to $3,900 a month, he said, adding that "demand is still there."
At 41 John Street, which Time Equities Inc. is converting into six lofts, leases have been signed since October on five one- and two-bedroom units, which average 1,100 to 1,800 square feet. The monthly rents are $2,500 to $5,000.
Work began two months ago at 90 John Street to convert the eighth through 35th floor to 222 apartments, many with terraces. The lower floors are offices. The residential area, with studio to two-bedroom units, with 500 to 1,100 square feet, as well as lofts and penthouses, will have a separate entrance and an address of 100 John Street, said Joseph Moinan, president of the Mazal Group, the developer.
"It is a tight market, and apartments at the right price, with the right layouts and in buildings with the right amenities will rent," Mr. Moinan said. Rents will average $32 a square foot a year, putting the rent for a 750-square-foot one-bedroom at $2,000 a month. Leasing is to begin by midsummer.
But A.J. Developers, which next month will start to convert 17 John Street into condominiums, is betting that some people will want to buy, "given the rise in the price of lofts in TriBeCa and SoHo," said Anthony Fromer, a principal.
Buyers will receive a tax under a city program that waives property taxes for apartment owners for the first eight years and phases them in for the next six.
"The monthly cost of owning an apartment will be less than renting one," Mr. Moinan added.
Prices for the studio to three-bedroom lofts are expected to range from $85,000 to $850,000, with penthouses costing $1.2 million. Sales are to start in February, and occupancy is expected by next winter.

HEADLINE: Angry Koreans Elect Longtime Dissident

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Friday, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Enraged by the financial crisis that has humbled their nation, Koreans overturned their political establishment on Thursday and elected as their new President Kim Dae Jung, a legendary pro-democracy campaigner whom past dictators had repeatedly tried to murder.
The outcome was all the more surprising because this is the first time in Korean history that an opposition candidate was elected to lead the nation. As in Japan and Taiwan, politics have been dominated here by a single ruling party, and Mr. Kim's victory may help nurture the rise of two-party politics in East Asia. 
 South Korea is the first troubled Asian economy to hold a major election since the financial crisis erupted, and Mr. Kim's victory suggests some of the political repercussions. Mr. Kim was elected in part because of fury at economic mismanagement by the ruling party. But he also won because the ruling party splintered and divided its vote.
While Kim Dae Jung is widely hailed as one of the most courageous campaigners for democracy in Asia, there are also widespread doubts among international investors about whether he is ready to carry out far-reaching economic restructuring, and the Korean stock market's initial reaction today was anxious.
Mr. Kim immediately tried to reassure foreign investors -- who have been profoundly alarmed by his populist instincts and by his closeness to labor unions -- that he will adhere to the conditions of the International Monetary Fund bailout this month.
"I will thoroughly implement a free-market economy, and I will resolutely open Korea's markets," Mr. Kim told a news conference this morning. "I will make this nation a place where foreigners can invest with confidence." Man in the News, page A8.
"We will diligently carry out the terms of the I.M.F.," said Mr. Kim, who had alarmed the markets during the campaign by calling for renegotiations of some of the terms.
To reassure foreign investors, Mr. Kim is hastily trying to arrange a trip to the United States -- particularly to Wall Street -- to reiterate his commitment to the I.M.F. accord and to market economics. Aides have been planning the trip for several days, in anticipation of a victory, and they say Mr. Kim could leave as soon as this weekend.
Final results showed Mr. Kim, whose name is pronounced kim day joong, with 40.4 percent of the vote, compared with 38.6 percent for his main rival, Lee Hoi Chang, a former judge who symbolized the ruling elite. The elections were solely for President; the next vote, for a National Assembly, is scheduled for 2000.
It is difficult to exaggerate the historical resonance of the scenes this morning as Mr. Kim -- the man who was nearly hanged as a traitor -- stood before a forest of microphones and accepted his election.
Mr. Kim, 72, still limps from one botched attempt to murder him, and even in the last few years his telephones have reportedly been tapped and his supporters have frequently been subjected to tax audits. Now he inherits this same powerful state apparatus that as recently as the 1980's was used to imprison him.
"Since the founding of our nation, this is the most historic, most radical day," Mr. Kim said somberly. "The Korean people made their choice and broke all the barriers, transferring power for the first time in our history. Democracy will take root and prosper."
Mr. Kim's advisers hailed their candidate as the man who could transform their nation politically and economically. "This change of Government is significant, but the implications are even more significant," said an exultant Ra Jong Yil, a political scientist who is a close adviser to Mr. Kim, as he helped draft Mr. Kim's acceptance speech at the campaign headquarters. "Our society is ready for change in every respect, including economics."
Mr. Kim will take office in February from President Kim Young Sam, who by law was barred from seeking another term. Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung are former partners in the cause of democracy who later became bitter rivals, and Kim Young Sam is now widely despised by the public because of scandals involving his family and because of the economic crisis.
Kim Dae Jung's victory represents an upset of Korean orthodoxy in part because he comes from the Cholla region in the southwest of the country, an area that is still widely scorned as uncouth and backward. People from Cholla have been largely shut out from prestige and power, and even today many Koreans would be horrified if a daughter began dating a man from Cholla.
In the Cholla city of Kwangju, ecstatic citizens poured into the streets to wave placards with Mr. Kim's face and chant his name. In 1980, in one of Asia's landmark clashes between people and power, the students of Kwangju staged an armed uprising and rallied for Mr. Kim and for democracy, but they were crushed by troops who machine-gunned protesters and killed more than 200.
As recently as the mid-1980's, the United States Embassy in Seoul regularly refused to invite Mr. Kim to its annual July 4 party, because he was regarded as a radical. Western diplomats seriously discussed whether he might be a North Korean agent -- a proposition for which there was never any evidence -- and army generals warned that they would stage a coup rather than allow him to become President.
It is a measure of Korea's growing political maturity that there is no talk of a coup today.
Although he was spurned by the American Embassy at times, Mr. Kim has warm feelings toward the United States. He has met President Clinton and has twice lived in the United States, where he cultivated his conversational English and studied American politics in action.
For many years while he was under house arrest in Seoul, he would invite visiting Americans to his home -- surrounded by other houses occupied by security agents spying on him -- and offer a Korean meal, political analysis and a bit of his Korean calligraphy. A rigorous Roman Catholic, Mr. Kim still has a huge annual Christmas card list of friends in America.
"Foremost in our foreign policy is good relations with the United States," said Professor Ra, who is one of several candidates to be Mr. Kim's Foreign Minister. "We cannot emphasize that too much."
It is not clear how officials at South Korea's Agency for National Security Planning, which has spent a great deal of effort monitoring Mr. Kim over the years, will react to his becoming their boss. Some Koreans argue that Mr. Kim has the same authoritarian instincts as his predecessors, and will now use the state apparatus to help his friends and retaliate against his enemies.
Others argue that Mr. Kim is such an outsider that this is impossible even if he wanted to do so. The security apparatus has never hired people close to Mr. Kim, for example, so he has no buddies to elevate.
Although it is a democracy, South Korea still has many political prisoners, mostly radical students or leftists who sympathize with North Korea's Communist regime. A dissident poet named Park No Hae, for example, is serving a life sentence for leading a socialist group, and it is unclear how Mr. Kim will deal with the national security law that put them behind bars.
In the campaign, Mr. Kim was reluctant to call for freeing those political prisoners, presumably because he could have been called a radical sympathizer. But as a former political prisoner himself, and as a critic of the national security law, he may try to make South Korean society more tolerant of dissent.
Mr. Kim's main rival, Mr. Lee, conceded defeat in the early morning hours, pledging support to "the honorable winner of the presidential election." Mr. Lee continued, "I will not spare my cooperation and support to the President-elect, with a view to overcoming the economic crisis in an atmosphere of stability and reconciliation."
This was Mr. Kim's fourth bid for the presidency, and to compete he broke a promise that the third bid in 1992 would be his last. His entire life has been a series of ups and downs, and it frequently seemed that he was destroyed and would never recover.
The personal cost has also been enormous. Just 10 days after his second wedding, in 1962, the military Government accused Mr. Kim of misconduct and sent him to prison. In all, he has spent five and a half years in prison, three years in exile, and six and a half years under surveillance and frequent detention.
During his first race for the presidency, in 1971, he mounted an unexpectedly strong challenge to President Park Chung Hee and was nearly killed for it. A truck smashed into Mr. Kim's car in a suspicious accident that is widely regarded as an assassination attempt. The accident killed Mr. Kim's driver and left him with a permanent limp.
Two years later, while Mr. Kim was on a trip to Tokyo, the Korean Central Intelligence Agency kidnapped him from his hotel room and smuggled him onto a ship at sea. Mr. Kim's captors chained him to a rock, apparently with the intention of throwing him overboard.
But Japanese and American authorities had discovered what had happened and put enormous pressure on South Korea not to kill Mr. Kim. He was taken back to Korea and eventually released.
In 1980, Mr. Kim came close to being hanged, but in the end the international protests were so great that President Chun Doo Hwan sent Mr. Kim to exile in America.

HEADLINE: One Dissenter At Fed Urged Rate Increase

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers faced with fragile markets, Asia's crisis and concerns about inflation -- had one dissenter in their decision to leave short-term interest rates unchanged at their meeting on Nov. 12.
The Federal Open Market Committee voted 11 to 1 to leave the Federal funds target interest rate for overnight loans between banks unchanged at 5.50 percent, according to minutes of the meeting issued today. The committee also retained its bias in favor of raising interest rates, if necessary, to guard against accelerating inflation, the minutes showed. 
 "In this environment, with markets still skittish, a tightening of U.S. monetary policy risked an oversize reaction" in financial markets, the minutes said.
The dissenter at the meeting was Alfred Broaddus, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, who cited concerns that rapid United States growth would translate into inflation. Mr. Broaddus also dissented at the group's May 20 meeting.
At its latest meeting Tuesday, the policy makers declined again to change interest-rate policy. Minutes of this week's session will be issued Feb. 5, after the session on Feb. 3 and 4.
By changing the interest rates it controls, the Fed's actions translate into lower or higher borrowing costs on everything from credit cards to mortgages and business loans -- and directly influence economic activity, though often with a lag of many months.
The committee last raised the target a quarter-point on March 25, expressing concern that the economy's rapid growth could translate into accelerating inflation.
Since March, the Government's inflation gauges have fallen to their lowest levels in a decade or more, prompting talk about a possible rate cut in 1998.

HEADLINE: U.S. Braces for Wider Trade Gaps and New Confrontations

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
After years in which the strong economy has dampened confrontations over international trade, the issue is set to flare again against a backdrop of turmoil in Asia as imports surge and exporters find it more difficult to sell their goods abroad.
The near-certainty that the United States trade deficit will be driven sharply higher by the economic crisis sweeping through Asia has profound economic and political implications. 
 Some American workers could lose their jobs, and employers could feel pressure to hold down wages. The profits of multinational corporations have already been put under pressure by the downturn in Asia, unnerving investors, and analysts are forecasting more bad earnings news.
On the positive side, a flood of cheap imports could help hold down inflation and obviate the need for higher interest rates. But tensions with large trading partners like Japan could be revived.
The Asian crisis is already altering trade patterns. In South Korea, for example, American goods are nearly twice as expensive, when bought with the country's suddenly devalued currency, as they were at the beginning of the year. That is squeezing American exporters ranging from auto-parts makers to farmers and could imperil the jobs those exports support.
A survey this week by the National Association of Manufacturers found that four out of five manufacturing executives anticipated significantly lower exports next year because of the problems in Asia and the resulting currency fluctuations. Among the industries that the association expects to be particularly hard hit are electronics, telecommunications equipment and capital goods.
At the same time, imports from Asian countries are tumbling in price, reflecting the steep decline in the values of their currencies relative to the dollar -- a boon to consumers and a big help in holding down inflation. Government statistics released last week showed that prices of imports from South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore fell 1.2 percent in November alone, before the most recent round of currency declines.
Economists said the effect would be to drive the trade deficit back to or above the records set in the late 1980's, although it would still be a smaller share of economic output than in the 80's.
Some foreign governments are already maneuvering for what they expect will be an increasingly nasty economic and political battle with Washington. The Japanese, clearly fearful of a backlash in Washington, are already playing down the importance of any big increase in their trade gap with the United States.
"What's the problem?" Keizo Obuchi, the country's Foreign Minister, said during a visit to Washington 10 days ago, departing from the usual Japanese assurances in recent years that the deregulation of Japan's economy will close its trade gap with the United States.
"If you buy Japanese goods, and we use the money to buy oil from Saudi Arabia, and they buy F-16's, there is no real difficulty," Mr. Obuchi said.
In public, Clinton Administration officials say the rising deficit is a sign of economic strength, not weakness, and in any case represents only a tiny fraction of the nation's economic activity. But in private, they are clearly worried.
Organized labor and other opponents of unfettered trade, especially in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, scored a big victory last month when they blocked President Clinton's request to Congress for a renewal of his trade-negotiating authority.
A sharp increase in the trade deficit would only embolden Mr. Clinton's opponents on trade issues and would further complicate the President's efforts to persuade Democrats to support him in pursuing more market-opening deals.
"People are going to use this as a way to say that the U.S. is losing jobs to these countries and that we shouldn't be so fixated on bilateral and multilateral trade opportunities," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California, who supports Mr. Clinton's trade agenda. "As some of these numbers come out, it could be a problem for us."
Administration officials and many economists say the projected increase in the deficit is nothing more than a reflection of the strong demand for goods and services being generated by a nation growing much faster than its main trading partners.
And there are benefits from the imbalance. American consumers will enjoy lower prices on Sony camcorders from Japan, Hyundai automobiles from South Korea, sneakers from Malaysia and other Asian goods. Because domestic competitors will have to hold down their prices as well, the overall inflation rate should be kept in check.
The flip side is that American companies will have even less ability than they have had in recent years to raise prices in the United States. Combined with their difficulties in exporting, the profit outlook for many companies is worsening. In the last week, companies like Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and Nike have reported or forecast disappointing earnings results in part because of the problems in Asia, and the stock price of companies like the Dell Computer Corporation have been hurt by concern about earnings.
But even the slowdown in exports will have a positive side. Many economists are forecasting that it will help take some steam out of an economy that has been threatening to overheat, thus reducing growth to a sustainable pace and preventing the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.
"These rising trade numbers, which scare the American people and bring frothing to the mouths of politicians, are in some ways a sign of the United States doing its job," said M. Carey Leahy, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, an economic consulting firm.
"Clearly no one will complain about an influx of cheap, high-quality Asian goods," Mr. Leahy said. "The joke that no consumer ever died in a price war is certainly true."
But, Mr. Leahy and other economists said, there is clearly a dark side to steep increases in trade deficits. Import competition and slowing exports will cost some workers in the United States their jobs, especially in manufacturing industries, and could put pressure on employers to hold down wages. Some economists think the profits of American corporations will suffer, potentially unnerving stock market investors, who have been betting on continued strong earnings growth.
"It's a serious issue macroeconomically, and it's serious for the incomes of working families," said Thomas I. Palley, the assistant director of public policy for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
After peaking at $153 billion in 1987, or about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product, during a period of widespread concern that the United States was ceding global economic leadership to Japan, the annual deficit in the trade of goods and services fell sharply in the early 1990's, largely because the United States fell into recession, pushing down demand for imports.
But from a low of $30 billion in 1991, the deficit has bounced back steadily, to $111 billion last year, or about 1.5 percent of G.D.P. The deficit has been running at roughly the same pace for this year but is expected by most economists to soar next year as the United States feels the full effect of the currency devaluations in Asia. Its percentage of G.D.P., however, should remain well below the 1987 level.
"Signs of weaker exports, increased imports, lower commodity prices and lower prices for goods that are subject to foreign competition should increase and intensify in coming months," said Allen Sinai, an economist with Primark Decision Economics.
DRI/McGraw Hill, the economic consulting firm, said that the trade deficit would expand to $150 billion next year and to $170 billion in 1999. The projected rise for next year is $27 billion greater than the firm was projecting just two months ago, before the magnitude of the Asian crisis had become clear.
The effect on the economy could be considerable. Maury N. Harris, an economist at Paine Webber in New York, said he expected the rising trade deficit to cut eight-tenths of 1 percent from growth in gross domestic product next year. The economy has been growing this year at close to 4 percent.
The Administration's biggest trade concern now is that a cycle of "competitive devaluations" will set in, in which countries allow the value of their currencies to decline so that their goods remain competitive with those of their competitors.
That has already happened in Southeast Asia, where there have been at least three major rounds of devaluations, the latest within the last week. Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, is now lower than it has been since 1971. That, in turn, drives the Thai baht lower and puts pressure on the currencies of Malaysia and other economies in the region. Leaders of the Southeast Asian governments, meeting in Kuala Lumpur this week, admitted to feelings of financial impotence.
"When you are up against forces that you can't fight against, there is little you can do," said Mahathir Mohamad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia.
The big worry now is that Japan will also allow its currency to devalue, responding to what has happened in Korea. "That is the scary scenario," one senior Administration official said. "They make many of the same products -- cars, steel, semiconductors. So the pressures in Japan to let the currency go are tremendous."
The yen got some welcome support from the Japanese Government's plan, announced on Wednesday, to lower taxes by $15.3 billion to spur economic growth. The move reversed the yen's steady slide against the dollar, but it is unclear whether the threat of further weakness in the Japanese currency has passed.
So far, Japan's Finance Ministry has publicly threatened to intervene to keep the yen strong, and it made good on that threat this week. But many traders think that eventually Tokyo will bow to pressure from its large manufacturers to allow a significant decline.
Until the last few months, the Administration's chief concern has been the rising trade deficit with China. The imbalance with Beijing had begun to approach the kind of numbers ordinarily seen in trade with Japan, and already American officials were issuing public warnings to the Chinese.
But China's currency is not fully convertible, so it has been left out of the devaluations that have struck the rest of Asia. Still, China is hardly likely to recede as a trade problem.
Administration officials said any downturn in exports to Asia or other parts of the world would be further evidence of why the United States should continue to work aggressively to open foreign markets. But they said there was no quick and simple solution to any rise in the deficit driven by the Asian turmoil.
"Any increase in the trade deficit is not a function of trade policy, and it is not one that changes in trade policy can cure," said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative. "We're looking at a macroeconomic situation of tremendous proportions."

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Climb as Investors Seek Safety of U.S. Bonds

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended higher yesterday as tumbling world stock markets pushed investors to the relative safety of United States securities.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/32, to 102 29/32. The bond's yield -- a benchmark for corporate and consumer interest rates -- slipped to 5.92 percent from 5.93 percent. Shorter-term maturities also rose. The yield on the two-year note fell to 5.64 percent from 5.66 percent. 
 Treasury prices began climbing in overseas trading as Asian stock markets slumped.
In the United States, bonds closely tracked the movement of the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 3.4 percent in the morning, helping drive 30-year bond yields as low as 5.86 percent. When stocks recovered, bond prices came off their highs. The Dow industrials ended the day down 90.21 points, or 1.2 percent, at 7,756.29.
"Right now, how equities behave is having the biggest impact on the bond market," said Ken Windheim, who manages $5.5 billion at Strategic Fixed Income in Arlington, Va.
Neil DeSarno, co-head of government bond trading at CIBC Oppenheimer, said: "The flight to quality is continuing. The U.S. bond market just doesn't want to go down."
Many investors and analysts see the Asian crisis shaving a half a percentage point or more off growth in the United States next year, helping keep a lid on inflation. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in the first 11 months of the year, the slowest in a decade.
William Gross, who oversees $110 billion of bonds at the Pacific Investment Management Company in Newport Beach, Calif., said the economy could slow enough next year to prompt the Federal Reserve to lower its target rates for overnight lending, although not for some time. The Federal funds rate is now 5.5 percent, where it was set in March. Fed officials voted not to touch the rate at their final policy meeting of the year on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Dollar Still Up Despite Bank of Japan Sales

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar continued to climb against the yen yesterday despite another round of multibillion-dollar sales by the Bank of Japan in an effort to defend its currency.
 Another failure of a large Japanese corporation, this time the food trader Toshoku Ltd., and more than 5 percent drops in Japanese and Korean stocks also pressured the yen, traders said. 
 The Bank of Japan entered the market to sell dollars for yen for the third consecutive day, but traders said the dollar recovered from the interventions mostly unscathed. They stressed that there was still overwhelming skepticism surrounding Japan's efforts to escape its economic malaise.
 "The market is emboldened based on economic conditions, rather than the gestures of the Bank of Japan," said Kevin Lawrie, global manager of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank. Solid profits from repeated yen sales have, of course, also bolstered the trade, he added.
In late trading in New York, the dollar settled at 128.93 yen, up from 128.72 yen on Thursday. The dollar also traded at 1.7753 marks, barely changed from 1.7757 marks. The pound rose to $1.6681 from $1.6653.
In other trading, the dollar rose to an 11-year high against the Canadian dollar after the Bank of Canada left interest rates unchanged. The slide came despite repeated sales of the United States currency by the Canadian central bank. The Canadian dollar settled at 69.86 United States cents, down from 70.3 Thursday.

HEADLINE: Newfangled Idea For Old-Fashioned Toy;
These Next-Generation Jigsaw Puzzles Take Off in a Direction All Their Own

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: VILLE ST. LAURENT, Quebec

 BODY:
When he stumbled on a simple way to make jigsaw puzzles in three dimensions, Paul E. Gallant knew he had a good idea.
When he looked at the cost of developing that idea, though, he concluded that the Canadian market was just too small -- that his only hope of turning a profit would be to focus on exports. 
 That is what he did, and while he might have made it even if he had been content to stay north of the border, the route he took transformed his small Quebec company into a global success story, and his simple idea has made its mark in the toy industry.
Go near a toy display anywhere in North America this Christmas and there is a good chance of running into one or more versions of Mr. Gallant's good idea. His company, Wrebbit Inc., along with his new United States partner, Hasbro Inc., will turn out more than 10 million three-dimensional puzzles this year of buildings like the Taj Majal and the Tower of Pisa, as well as contemporary icons, like the Millennium Falcon from "Star Wars."
And all this started with a toy industry novice. Most of Mr. Gallant's prior career was devoted to marketing and distributing records. Even as a child, he did not particularly enjoy doing puzzles.
In a high-tech age of electronic toys and whiz-bang video games, Wrebbit's Puzz 3D puzzles are resiliently old-fashioned, even if they are a true innovation. Jigsaw puzzles, developed in the 1700's, have had their ups and downs, with their appeal enhanced occasionally by, say, presenting a mystery whose solution is found by completing the puzzle.
But the toy industry is as cutthroat as Captain Hook and more capricious than Miss Piggy. One season's hits may bring yawns a season later, so it could be tough keeping Puzz 3D puzzles from becoming next year's Cabbage Patch doll.
"We've seen a lot of one-hit wonders," said Frank Reysen Jr., editor of Playthings magazine. "The shelf life of even the best toys is notoriously short-lived. The challenge for a manufacturer is figuring out how to keep a toy alive for two to three years."
The other problem for a popular toy is a rash of lower-priced, typically lower-quality knock-offs. Wrebbit's busy legal department has already fought, and won, three patent infringement cases in Canada and the United States.
"Me-too products are very common in the toy business," said Jill S. Krutick, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. Ms. Krutick said that even though lookalike puzzles were likely to siphon away some of Wrebbit's and Hasbro's sales, "Hasbro has maintained its dominant position in puzzles and games."
Wrebbit's puzzles -- made of the type of foam used to insulate airliner cockpits, and selling for an average of about $30 -- have quickly become a hit, with worldwide sales this year expected to surpass $100 million. Yet without Mr. Gallant's pursuit of the export market, the puzzles might not have grown much beyond the modest samples he had with him when he showed up at the Manhattan office of F.A.O. Schwarz on a September day in 1991.
"I had read in a toy magazine that if you ever had your product exposed in a Christmas window at F.A.O. Schwarz, you had an international window and most of the time that product would become a hit," Mr. Gallant, 53, said in an interview at Wrebbit headquarters in this industrial suburb of Montreal.
Mr. Gallant drove down from St. Laurent for a 2 P.M. meeting with Ian McDermott, the store's long-time game and puzzle buyer, who has since died. But Mr. McDermott was running late, and at 7 Mr. Gallant was still waiting.
When Mr. McDermott finally peeked out from behind his office door, Mr. Gallant reached into a box and pulled out a two-foot-high, three-dimensional assembled replica in foam and paper of a well-known Victorian mansion in Montreal.
"I took the puzzle and I threw it in the air," Mr. Gallant said. It flipped over, but remained in one piece. "I said, 'No glue, no pins, no nothing, it just stays like this interlocking.' And I pushed the wall off and I separated the pieces and showed him this was really a puzzle. And he said, 'Wow, where did you get that?' "
Mr. McDermott placed an immediate order for 72 puzzles, and they have been stocked in most of the company's 38 stores ever since.
In 1994, Wrebbit's success attracted the attention of Milton Bradley, the games division of Hasbro. A deal was made giving Hasbro the rights to manufacture for the mass market in the United States, while Wrebbit, which is privately owned, handles the specialty market and Canada.
"This takes puzzles to a whole new level," said Wayne Charness, a Hasbro spokesman.
What makes Wrebbit's success even more striking is that not many new toys succeed. According to Gary Jacobson, an analyst at Jefferies & Company, three out of five new toys fail and the big manufacturers are introducing fewer and fewer new toys and games.
"Toys 'R' Us is reducing the number of products they carry," he said. "They are sticking with what is tried and true."
While big toy companies spend millions on research and development, Mr. Gallant is very much a toy industry outsider. He spent 17 years marketing and distributing records in Montreal, then moved to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, where his responsibility was to make Canadian symphony orchestras known around the world and do tie-in merchandising.
In 1989, with cuts looming in federal support for Canadian Broadcasting, Mr. Gallant decided to scratch his entrepreneurial itch. He had done some television tie-ins, including a successful puzzle of "Anne of Green Gables."
But he knew he needed a gimmick. "I started thinking about puzzles, and how they hadn't changed much since the 1700's," he said. He thought of laminating a holographic image, but that would have been too big and too costly. He wondered why no one had ever made a true three-dimensional puzzle, but a few experiments showed that traditional cardboard pieces just fell in on themselves.
He eventually realized he needed something rigid but light. He tried polyethylene foam, but paint did not adhere to it, so he laminated a sheet of paper to the shapes.
At his kitchen table that night, he cut the foam into the shape of traditional puzzle pieces. To his surprise, he found that the foam pieces compressed slightly when joined together, and then expanded, forming a tight connection with enough rigidity to build a miniature wall.
"It was like a click, bang," he said. "My puzzle."
He formed a partnership with Rene Binette, who owned an air-conditioning and heating company in the Montreal area, and raised $250,000 in start-up money. They wanted to name the company after a regional animal or flower, but every one they liked was taken. "After two months I just said as a joke, 'Don't tell me we'll have to call ourselves the frogs,' " Mr. Gallant said, using the derogatory term for the French. They settled on Wrebbit, their phonetic spelling of a frog's call.
Focusing on exports is fairly typical at ambitious Canadian companies, with trade now accounting for 40 percent of Canada's $576 billion (Canadian) gross domestic product.
And although the free trade agreements of the last decade have been hugely unpopular with unions and some businesses, Mr. Gallant is an outspoken cheerleader. "In the business I'm in," he said, "the trade agreement has been fantastic."
The United States market has been vital to Wrebbit, which says American sales made up 85 percent of the $100 million total this year. Wrebbit also recently started selling in Europe, and next year expects to be in Asia as well.
Manufacturing costs are about the same in Canada as in the United States, with a weakened Canadian dollar compensating for the difference in transportation costs and slightly higher wages in heavily unionized cities like Montreal. But until the trade pact lowered or eliminated tariffs, exports to the United States carried a premium. And Canada's smaller market put restraints on local manufacturers.
"We were assuming 20,000 to 25,000 units" a year if the puzzles were released just in Canada, Mr. Gallant said. But at that volume, the puzzles would have cost twice as much.
Hasbro now manufactures many of the puzzles sold in the United States, but at peak times, like the pre-Christmas rush, Wrebbit's 340 workers turn out more than 30,000 puzzles a day to help meet demand.
"In my sweetest dreams," Mr. Gallant said, "I had not expected something like this."
Mr. Gallant admits that as Wrebbit's success attracted attention, he had to figure out answers to reporters' questions about why the puzzles are so popular. One explanation, he thinks, is "cocooning" -- families seeking entertainment in the house rather than outside.
And the process of assembling the puzzle is different, he explained. "When you see walls going up, the motivation to finish is stronger," Mr. Gallant said. "With regular puzzles, once you've done the horses and are into the blue skies, the motivation is not the same."
Not every model the company produced was a success. Wrebbit made a 1,038-piece version of the Muslim shrine of Mecca, but got into trouble when Saudi Arabia placed a large special order. After seeing a sample, the Saudis felt it was too realistic. The Mecca puzzles were never openly sold in the Arab world, and they are being removed from the company's catalogue.
"What Paul did was revolutionize the industry," said Jean Theberge, Wrebbit's vice president for corporate and legal affairs. "What everybody else is trying to do is to benefit from that." Wrebbit's success has indeed drawn imitators. The company has won recent suits against Telebrands, of New Jersey, and two Canadian companies.
Mr. Gallant says he is well aware that unless Wrebbit continues to innovate, its puzzles could end up in the discount bin. The Wrebbit lines now includes simpler puzzles of giraffes and elephants for young children. And the adult puzzles are moving away from famous buildings to cultural icons, like the Titanic, the CN tower in Toronto, and even a 3-D version of Monopoly.
Wrebbit has put some of its puzzles on CD-ROM. The three dimensions are all visual, as images of individual pieces are assembled on the computer screen. Once complete, the assembler gets to tour the interior of Notre Dame Cathedral, meet Quasimodo, and take in the view of Paris from the cathedral's roof.
The company has also moved into what Mr. Gallant calls Built Art, a cross between a puzzle and a model. At next year's New York Toy Fair, Wrebbit will display an intricate paper carousel powered by a counterweight that twirls and plays a European lullaby.
"People with computers and all their high-tech things get a chance to look at a basic mechanism," said Benoit Roberge, a member of Wrebbit's creative department who worked on the carousel. "They really are amazed when they see the simplicity."

(Christopher Morris for The New York Times); Standing Out From the Crowd -- Wrebbit, a Canadian puzzle maker, has made a big splash with its three-dimensional puzzles, like the Eiffel Tower. But games and puzzles make up a relatively small share of the toy market, and future growth for Wrebbit could be difficult because of the risk of cheaper knock-offs.

HEADLINE: In U.S. Notes of Praise, Quavers of Doubt on Kim

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Just a few months ago, the election of South Korea's best-known dissident as President would have been greeted in Washington with unbounded joy, the culmination of a quarter-century of efforts to coax one of America's closest Asian allies toward true multiparty democracy.
But even as President Clinton telephoned the President-elect, Kim Dae Jung, on Thursday night for what aides described as a warm 15-minute congratulatory call, many of his aides were developing strategies to insure that the transition over the next three months does not send South Korea's battered economy over the cliff. 
 "It's an astounding, Mandela-like moment," one top foreign policy adviser said shortly after the results were in. "We've got the man who can probably do more than anyone else to deal with North Korea. We've got the chance for a dynamic partnership.
"But first, he needs to understand that if the economic situation isn't solved" his first year "could be a nightmare."
Mr. Kim's two biggest problems -- managing the economy and managing North Korea -- are related.
Mr. Kim suggested today that he was ready to hold talks with Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader. But his negotiating leverage with the North will clearly be constrained if Seoul is still fighting its way through its greatest economic crisis since the end of the Korean War. South Korea's strategy for bringing about gradual, peaceful unification with the North has always hinged on its economic strength, and the promise of investments in new factories, roads and ports north of the Demilitarized Zone.
Even when South Korea was booming, officials blanched at studies suggesting that the cost of unification could run into the hundreds of billions of dollars. But now, with South Korean companies unable to borrow money on international markets, any promises of investment in the North would ring hollow.
Before Mr. Kim tackles those issues, though, he must negotiate a politically tricky transfer of power. For the first time in Korean history, the ruling party -- a descendant of four decades of military governments -- is surrendering control. The transition is further complicated by the fact that the incumbent President, Kim Young Sam, and the President-elect have a strong personal animosity that has poisoned their relationship for a decade.
The Clinton Administration's fear is that a rough transition could project an image of continued infighting, disagreement and disorganization in the South Korean Government, just when the world's financial markets are looking for signs of stability. Those fears seemed borne out on Friday, the day after the election, when the Korean currency dropped 9.5 percent in relation to the dollar.
So far, investors seem unimpressed with Kim Dae Jung's sudden backing of the International Monetary Fund's austerity program for South Korea; only two weeks ago he was vowing to renegotiate the terms of the $57 billion rescue package.
But over the past few days, Mr. Kim has sounded like a man who understands that the markets could make or break the first year of his presidency. His aides are already saying a visit to Wall Street could precede one to the White House.
And Mr. Kim is already talking the bond markets' language: "Only the business that can adjust to market economy and international competition will survive," he said just after he won. "Those which cannot shall surely perish because that is the cold, harsh reality of globalization."
While heartened by Mr. Kim's recent change of tone, American officials wonder whether his ties to the labor unions will cause him to hesitate at plant closings and bank shutdowns, which are bound to cause rising unemployment and, potentially, social unrest.
"The question is where he reaches for his economic advice," one senior Treasury Department official said. And ever so gently, American officials are trying to steer the new President toward economic advisers who embrace the American and Monetary Fund strategies, mainly economists who were trained in the United States and returned to Korea.
"I know there are doubts," said Donald Gregg, the former American Ambassador to South Korea and now president of the Korea Society in New York. "But Kim has several hidden advantages in dealing with the economic issues. The first is that there are low expectations of what he can accomplish. But he is both very smart and very tough, and he has more credibility with the unions than any other candidates would have enjoyed."
Under that theory, Mr. Kim may be in a good position to convince his followers that they need to endure a year or two of pain to return the country to an era of rapid growth.
"The second advantage he has," Mr. Gregg continued, "is that the fiscal problems undercut the hardliners in South Korea who say that the way to deal with the North is confrontation."
Mr. Kim's third advantage may be that during his years as a dissident, and in exile, he made broad contacts in the United States. He studied at Harvard (he keeps a collection of university mugs over the dining room table in his small house), and has visited Washington regularly in recent years. President Clinton has met him several times, though never for lengthy conversations.
"The trick is to build the kind of relationship we never had with Kim Young Sam," one senior Administration official said. "It's a big opportunity."

Stock prices plunged early yesterday but later regained much of the lost ground after Wall Street absorbed news of a big bankruptcy in Japan, a series of stock market declines around the world and a few earnings disappointments among American companies.
The quarterly expiration of stock options and futures contracts also contributed to the volatility in what was the second-busiest day ever on the New York Stock Exchange, with 793.2 million shares changing hands; a billion shares were traded on Oct. 28, the day stocks rebounded from a 550-point drop. 
 The latest symptom of the Asian malaise was the failure of a Japanese food trading company Toshoku Ltd., which sent world markets reeling early on Friday amid fears of further corporate and banking collapses in Japan.
The country's benchmark stock index, the Nikkei 225, fell 5.24 percent, to 15,314.89, it lowest level in more than a month.
When the day began on Wall Street, Treasury bonds were much in demand as investors sought safety, and stocks became hot potatoes. At one point, the Dow Jones industrial average was off as much as 269 points, or more than 3 percent, almost eclipsing last week's entire 310-point dive.
Then bargain hunters stepped in to help stocks recover somewhat. The Dow finished down 90.21 points, or 1.15 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.52, to 946.78.
But a late rally among technology shares, so beaten down in recent trading sessions, pushed the Nasdaq composite index into positive territory. It closed up 1.55, at 1,524.74, led by gains in Intel, up 7/8, to 70; Applied Materials, 1 7/8, to 30; Sun Microsystems, 1 5/8, to 38 11/16, and Ascend Communications, 3 1/16, to 27 5/16.
Sharp swings in the market were to be expected for a while, said Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "This is how it's going to be until we begin to know more" about Asia's impact on American companies and about fourth-quarter earnings, she said, adding that she considered yesterday's early selloff overdone.
Despite the market's partial comeback, some stock analysts were beginning to wonder if investors would continue to rush in on bad news and snap up stocks at lower prices, as they have done repeatedly.
In late October, the mantra "was that fundamentals are good," said Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. But now, the outlook has dimmed.
"All of a sudden, you hear companies saying growth is slower," he said. "And it's not the Far East -- it's the United States. Under the surface there's increasing recognition that corporate profit growth is slowing after what had been a very good year."
The 3Com Corporation joined the disappointment club. The computer networking company, which reported results after the market closed on Thursday, turned in a slight profit, consistent with its previous warning, for its fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 30. It fell 1/2, to 32 5/8. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing lost 2 5/16, to 83 5/8, and Oracle, dropped 3/8, to 21 5/8; both have also warned in recent weeks that profits would be below expectations.
Universal Forest Products lost 21/32, to 12 29/32; Bell & Howell dropped 9/16, to 22 5/16, and Briggs & Stratton lost 3 3/16, to 49 1/16; the companies all said yesterday that quarterly earnings might not meet expectations.
Nike said after the market closed on Thursday that it would have a 20 percent decline in earnings for its second quarter and warned of further problems related to Asia. But after a sharp decline early in the day, its shares closed at 40 1/8, up 1/8.
Optimism on Wall Street has not been dashed for the long term, but it is moderating. Stock analysts' earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter slipped for the fifth week in a row, said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call.
The average earnings gain projected for the S.& P. 500 is now 8.3 percent, down from 8.8 percent last week. In spite of this, Mr. Hill said, forecasts for growth next year remained relatively high, at 14.1 percent.
The gyrations in stocks were good for bonds yesterday. As stocks plunged, the bond market rallied, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury falling to 5.88 percent at one point, the lowest since Oct. 20, 1993. Later Treasury prices retreated modestly as stocks recouped some of their losses.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gained 7/32, to 102 27/32, pushing its yield down a basis point, or hundredth of a point, to 5.92 percent. The yield is down more than half a percentage point from mid-October, when turbulence in Asian financial markets sent international investors in search of the guaranteed returns of Government-backed debt.
"Lower bond yields just tell how pessimistic people are getting about growth," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at the Nikko Securities Company International. "If you really want to buy stocks you have to be bullish on earnings."
As has been the case through several plunges this year, investors seized the moment to pick up some stocks at lower prices.
"We felt there were opportunities created for anyone willing to look past the end of their nose," said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards. "The fears have been way overdone. We have been living with the problems in Southeast Asia for almost three months."
Mr. Goldman said he was buying shares of companies whose earnings should be largely unaffected by Asia's economic slowdown. Yesterday, he said he was buying Reading & Bates, Nationsbank, Banc One and Schering-Plough.
He also bought Compaq.

Amid concerns that Asia's economic crisis will hurt profits, stocks fell around the world. Stock volatility was also heightened by the "triple witching" expiration of stock and index options and futures. Here is a sample of yesterday's changes in principal stock indexes.

A Few Clicks, and Microsoft Is in a New Fight on Browser
Earlier this week, Microsoft talked tough: Remove its Internet browser from the latest version of Windows, as a Federal judge had ordered, and the operating system would be crippled, the company said. Not so, say computer experts -- and computer amateurs, including the judge hearing the Microsoft antitrust case, who demonstrated removing the browser in court.
 
 While the demonstration appeared to demolish a central defense of the company, Microsoft said the judge's experiment was not meaningful because it did not remove all the browser's program codes and files from the computer, as the Justice Department and the judge's order had sought. Page A1.
 
Pessimism Revisits Seoul
A day after opposition leader Kim Dae Jung won the South Korean presidential election, the nation's financial crisis resurrected the specter of default and sent its stock market and currency plunging. The Government took new emergency steps, hiring Goldman, Sachs & Company and Salomon Smith Barney as advisers and announcing it would guarantee up to $20 billion in loans sought abroad by cash-starved banks. A6.
 
Even as President Clinton called Kim Dae Jung to congratulate him, many White House aides were devising strategies to insure that the transition of power in South Korea does not wreck its battered economy. A6.

Harrah's to Acquire Showboat
Harrah's Entertainment plans to acquire Showboat for $519 million in cash, strengthening its hold on the gambling markets in Atlantic City and the Chicago area. Harrah's said the deal would make it the world's biggest gambling company. D3.
 
Deal to Sharpen Occidental's Focus
Occidental Petroleum's agreement to sell its Midcon gas pipeline unit to KN Energy for $3.49 billion will help move Occidental further into its core oil business. The deal, announced late Thursday, will quadruple KN's assets. Midcon owns one of the largest transporters of natural gas into the Chicago area. D5.
 
Mixed Reviews for Chiron Drugs
An Food and Drug Administration panel recommended that a Chiron drug be approved to treat metastatic melanoma, a fatal skin cancer. But the same panel did not recommend approval of another Chiron drug, Depocyt, for use in patients with neoplastic meningitis arising from solid tumors. Shares of Chiron fell 2.4 percent, while shares of Chiron's partner in Depocyt, Depotech, plunged 68.3 percent. D2.
 
Bonds Rally on Stock Drop
Investors retreating from a worldwide drop in stock prices sought the sanctuary of Treasury securities, pushing bond prices up and yields down. The 30-year bond yield fell to 5.92 percent from 5.93 percent. D2.
 
Dollar Rises on Japan Weakness
The dollar climbed further against the yen, overcoming attempts by the Bank of Japan to defend the Japanese currency by selling dollars. In New York the dollar settled at 128.93 yen, up from 128.72 yen Thursday. D4.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From White House Meeting With Conservatives on Race

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a discussion of racial matters held in the Oval Office today between President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, former Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey, Ward Connerly, Linda Chavez, Thaddeus Garrett, Representative Charles Canady of Florida, Elaine Chao, Lynn Martin and Abigail and Stephan Thernstrom, as transcribed by the White House:
MR. CLINTON. The reason I wanted you to come here today is that I hope there will be another series of meetings where we'll get an even more diverse group -- I mean, diverse by opinion. Because what I'm trying to get to is -- here's my theory about this -- I think if we could ever get to the point where we would ask ourselves, can we agree on the objective, and then talk about what means will work, and then look at the things we don't like and say, well, do they do any good; and what harm did it do. 
 For example, what I think about affirmative action, a lot of these economic ----. Let's just take economic affirmative action. What I honestly believe is that it did a profound amount of good for the people who got into the programs who might never have had a chance to be successful businessmen or women. But I believe the problems with it are twofold. No. 1 is, once you get in and you start doing it, it's hard to graduate out. This whole theory about graduating out and moving through, going out into the private sector, that theory never really worked very well. And we ought to fess up; those of us who were for it ought to say that's one of the problems that didn't work.
The other problem is it doesn't reach the vast majority of the people who have a problem because it doesn't reach down into basically the isolated urban areas with people in the economic underclass. . . .
Let me go back to what Steve said about the composition of the police force when you got into the tete-a-tete with the Vice President. Let me just mention three things because Governor Kean mentioned this. The seven white septuplets were delivered by two African-American women doctors. Two days later, two black kids were rescued in a Chicago fire by a white fireman. Nobody feels anything but good about that. Why is that? Or why do all these rich white Republicans pay to go down and watch some black guys play basketball at the MCI Center? I would argue there is something that all these things share in common that don't necessarily get answered in the police ----.
One is, in the case pro basketball, here I am, I don't have a doubt in the world that if I'd been good enough I could have played pro basketball. I know it. If I'd been good enough, by God, I could have played. I was short, fat, and slow by today's standards. I couldn't play. Doesn't have anything to do with my race. I don't have a doubt in the world. If I have a child, I don't have a doubt in the world that my child can play if he or she is good enough. So that's the first threshold. . . .
The second thing is, in the case of the black women doctors who delivered the septuplets -- which is not always the case in the case of police -- which is why I agree with the Vice President -- the community, which was of a different race -- there was no question about whether they could do their job in a way that would be fair to everybody. In the case of the white fireman who risked his life to go in an get the last two black kids in the Chicago fire -- he made a statement that was louder than any words I will every utter, that he was in tune with the people in that community. He was in tune enough that he was willing to lay his life down to save those two little children. Nobody will ever care again whether that guy is on their fire or sitting idly out in front of the fire station, as I hope he will be.
So there's two criteria. One is can you play if you're good enough, whatever the thing is. Two is, does everybody in the community have confidence that the people in the position, whatever they are, have sufficient concern about them, are consistently involved with them, that whatever is supposed to be done is going to get done.
I think in the case of the fireman, and the doctors and the basketball players, the answer is yes. I think in the case -- huge numbers of urban police departments, huge numbers of the business sector, huge sections of higher education -- you can't say that the answer is yes. That's why I'm hung up about it. But I don't think that -- I think the reason that I'd get frustrated if the debate is only about affirmative action is, if we win 100 percent of the debate, we're talking about 10 percent of the people. If you win 100 percent of the debate, we're still just talking about 10 percent of the people. What about everybody else? . . .
MS. THERNSTROM. But, why don't you have confidence that we can train policemen the way we train firemen so that when a policeman shows up at the door, it doesn't matter what the race of that policeman is?
MR. CLINTON. What I don't have confidence in is that in the police departments where there is not affirmative action that there is a selection process that is not race-based.
MS. THERNSTROM. Why not go after the problem instead -- it's like college admissions -- instead of going after the problem of the failure of our schools in the K-12 years, we say, O.K., we're going to shut our eyes to that problem and we're going to preferentially admit them in hope something --
MR. CLINTON What about all the people who are sitting around waiting for that to happen? Are we just going to let them drift away?
MS. CHAO. -- very complicated, and there is really a problem on both sides. I think you and the Vice President obviously have demonstrated you care deeply about this problem. And I think you should be applauded, from my point of view, in terms of showing that you care, offering some leadership, and talking about this issue. I think it's enormously complicated. But I do want to say you, as the President of this country, have an enormous opportunity to really lead this country on a new millennium, as you put it, of race relations, and that is that people are judged by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin.
What has bothered me so far about the debate is that it's very much a monochromatic kind of debate. It has been about African-Americans, and it's been about whites. And certainly there has been a great deal that has contributed to the current status of these two races, but if we really talk about a diversified nation, in which there is richness and diversity, we have to talk about other people. And I'm not pushing for Asian-Americans or Latino-Hispanic Americans, but that's what you get pretty much into when you start talking about color. . . .

HEADLINE: The New York State of Mind Is Wreathed in Good Cheer

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
Jennifer Calhoun has driven a carriage in Central Park for 15 years, and not since the boom years of the 1980's has business been so good. And it seems that everyone who steps into her white carriage, festooned with red bows, is laden with Big Brown Bags from Bloomingdale's or bags with the wooden-soldier emblem of Saks Fifth Avenue.
"People seem to be spending more freely," said Ms. Calhoun, who is 35. With a good economy fostering good cheer, she said she also was receiving far more generous tips, many in the $50 range. "The mid-80's were great," she said. "It's coming close to that. People are better dressed. They have more money to spend." 
 As a Brazilian family boarded Ms. Calhoun's carriage, a group of preschoolers marched along Central Park South singing "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer." Even a homeless man picking through trash barrels at the Central Park Zoo hummed along as the bells of the Delacorte Clock chimed "Silent Night."
No one keeps definitive state-of-mind statistics, but random interviews, street-corner observations and a smattering of hard facts suggest that there is more jolliness than usual in the city this season. Crime is down, tourism is up, the economy is better, temperatures are mild and the throngs seem thicker than ever. According to the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, the city is expected to play host to 31.9 million tourists this year, a record number, and by the end of the year, they are expected to have spent $13.7 billion.
Of course there are overt reminders of the time of year: the Brobdingnagian boxwood candy canes hanging from the Solow Building on West 57th Street, or a ponytailed, bandanna-wearing Santa astride a revolving Harley atop the entrance of the Harley-Davidson Cafe on the Avenue of the Americas.
But there are more subtle clues as well: people actually holding doors open for strangers, and smiles on the faces of otherwise stone-faced department store clerks. Many tourists say they are finding New York more pleasant and New Yorkers more hospitable than on previous visits.
Chris and MaryJane Mudd of Houston were waiting for a taxi outside the New York Hilton, where they were staying during what they called a combination business trip and second honeymoon. Mrs. Mudd, a public relations director, last visited New York in 1988. "On this visit, the airport was cleaner and it's easier to get around," she said. "Our taxi had seat belts. I don't know if it's the Mayor or what."
Mr. Mudd, a commercial manager at Dow Chemical Company, concurred. "The city is cleaner and safer," he said, "and there are not as many angry, weird people walking around."
Daniel English was spending his first visit to New York City ringing a bell outside Macy's on 34th Street and Seventh Avenue. As a cadet for the Salvation Army, Mr. English, 33, and his fiancee, both from Pittsburgh, were dispatched to what they believed would be the most inhospitable place in America to stand in the cold asking for charity.
They were pleasantly surprised. "I think people here are better than the stereotypical image of New Yorkers that you see on TV," Mr. English said. "You know, hardened, miserable, always swearing at you. People will come up to us and ask for directions and someone else will walk up and start telling them the way." Well-heeled businessmen, he added, discreetly slip $20 bills into the red kettle and walk away silently, not wanting to call attention to their deed.
Barbara and Lincoln Howell and their daughter Alisha, 6, who flew from San Francisco to take in the Radio City Music Hall Christmas Show and to shop, queued up with others to see the Saks Fifth Avenue Christmas windows, a mini-theater of animated wooden figures that tell the tale of the Nutcracker. "Christmas in San Francisco is nice," Mrs. Howell said. "But Christmas here is more traditional." She paused. "This is New York, you know what I mean."
Inside Saks, standing at a jewelry case, under a canopy of fake evergreen boughs touched with fake snow and lights, Robert Cordes, 35, an entertainment accountant, considered the attitude of New Yorkers this Christmas and concluded that people are much more comfortable parting with their money and are doing so cheerfully.
"I definitely think people are in better spirits," he said. "The economy is fueling upscale shopping. People are opening their pocketbooks a little more. I definitely am. I just waited 45 minutes at Tiffany's to get service."
Outside the Plaza Hotel, Edward Trinka, a doorman for 35 years, offered his observations as he lugged bags. "New York is very festive," he said. "Everybody's happy, in a good mood. The police are present everywhere. Tips are better. I started working here in 1962. It's getting back to those days, the good old days."
Richard Brown, 49, a venture capitalist, stood outside the Wollman Rink in Central Park waiting for his son to finish skating and offered a bottom-line explanation. "The interest rate is down," he said. "The market is up. In New York City, the home of capitalism, when the economy is strong, things always seem better. I hate to put it in pure economic terms, but that's New York."
Of course, this is still New York, so it stands to reason that someone must be miserable. Perhaps the most determined holdouts against the seasonal cheer are the cabbies. In contrast to doormen and hansom drivers, the cabdrivers interviewed unanimously declared that tips were just the same as always. Except for one driver who insisted that people were getting stingier.
"On a $7 fare, I sometimes get 50 cents," said Alexis Pichardo, a native of the Dominican Republic and a New York cabdriver since the late 1970's. "I tell them to keep it. Save it for the next taxi driver. At least give the guy a dollar."
And the crowds vexed some locals. "If I can help it, I stay away from Fifth Avenue this time of year," said Maria Torresy, a resident of the Upper East Side, standing on the corner of 57th Street and Fifth Avenue after eating lunch with a friend at Doubles, a private club. "I forgot who said it, but a friend told me they were looking forward to a recession, so that they could find a cab."
And one shopper, applying maroon-brown lip liner in the ladies room at Saks, snapped when approached by a reporter. "Don't ask!" she said, her dark hair falling past her hips. "This is not my time of year. I'm suicidal."

HEADLINE: Pressed by Environmentalists, Pataki Drops Prison Plan

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
Under intense pressure from some of the state's largest environmental groups, the Pataki administration said yesterday that it had abandoned plans to build a 750-cell maximum-security prison in the quaint Adirondack hamlet of Tupper Lake.
Instead, the State Department of Correctional Services is considering building the prison on a 110-acre site in the town of Malone just outside the northern boundaries of Adirondack Park, the largest state park outside Alaska with six million acres of remote lakes, mountains and forests. 
 The plan to put the new prison in Tupper Lake had sparked a furious debate in the North Country over the future of the park, which is both a prime vacation spot and one of the state's most economically depressed regions. Local business leaders and correctional officers had contended that the prison would create jobs and invigorate the local economy. But vacation homeowners and several environmental groups had charged that the prison would severely pollute Tupper Lake and the town's water supply, and they vowed to file suit to block construction.
The fight also threatened to spill over into next year's gubernatorial race, when Democrats were expected to use the prison proposal to attack Gov. George E. Pataki's environmental record.
State officials cited concerns about lawsuits and the construction delays they might cause in announcing their change of plans yesterday, saying the Tupper Lake site posed environmental and legal problems.
"From the beginning, our public position has been that the process of siting the prison must accommodate both environmental protection and public safety," said Glenn S. Gourd, Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services. "Public safety requires that we move ahead quickly and identify a new site."
The state opened its last maximum-security prison in the mid-1980's, and the system has for years suffered from serious overcrowding that has heightened the risk of inmate violence, state officials say. For that reason, the Pataki administration has been rushing to open the new prison, which would house 1,500 inmates two to a cell by the middle of 1999.
The order to withdraw the Tupper Lake plans came from Katherine N. Lapp, Mr. Pataki's director of criminal justice services. It was not clear whether Mr. Pataki himself had told Ms. Lapp to issue the order. The Governor's office did not return repeated calls this evening.
Opponents of the prison, many of whom said they had been harassed by prison supporters, expressed relief with the state's decision.
The fight had "turned neighbor against neighbor, and friend against friend," said Nellie Staves, a Tupper Lake resident who said her laundry was taken from the line and thrown in the mud the day after a local newspaper printed her criticisms of the prison. "It really has caused an awful lot of bitterness here in Tupper Lake," she said, "and it will be a while before it passes on."
John Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council, a nonprofit environmental group, said the prison would have been located over two underground aquifers and along the shores of a pond that feeds directly into Tupper Lake. Pollution from the construction site and rainwater runoff from the prison's parking lots would have ruined wells, fueled algae growth and killed off a huge number of fish, he said.
Mr. Sheehan said his group, and probably most other environmental groups, would not object to the prison being built in Malone, which is about 40 miles north of Tupper Lake. Malone already has two medium security prisons, and correctional department officials said the leading site would be adjacent to one of those, the 1,739-inmate Bare Hill prison.
But proponents of the prison, who just a few months ago had been toasting their town's good fortune after the Legislature approved the Tupper Lake site, expressed fury with environmentalists for thwarting what they called the best economic development opportunity the area had seen in years. The $130 million prison was expected to provide 367 permanent jobs and pump tens of millions of dollars into the local economy annually.
"It would have been a good economic shot in the arm," Paul Maroun, a Franklin County legislator, said. "People feel tricked by the environmentalists."
Among the strongest advocates of the Tupper Lake site was a group of as many as 200 correctional officers living in the area who have been commuting long distances to other prisons and had been counting on the new prison to shorten their travel. Yesterday, some of those officers bitterly accused Mr. Pataki of caving in to the demands of environmentalists.
"He has to continue to travel, and that's very hard on the family," said Becky Moeller, referring to her husband, Richard, who works in Utica, which is a two-hour drive away. "We have a 4-year-old and I'm pregnant and it's just really hard."

Whitman Signs Bills Doubling Cigarette Tax

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Ushering in the first tax increase of her administration, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed two bills into law yesterday that would double the state's cigarette tax to raise $205 million a year to help pay for hospital care for the uninsured and for school construction.
Flanked by legislative leaders of both parties, the Governor said the new laws "establish a permanent solution to charity care that everybody said we couldn't do." 
 Lawmakers approved the bills on Thursday, in time to meet a Dec. 31 deadline, when the current system of charity-care financing is set to expire. Under that system, money from an unemployment insurance fund is used to pay the estimated $400 million annual cost of hospital care for the state's uninsured.
Under the new laws, the state will gradually reduce its reliance on the fund over the next five years, thereby cutting employers' unemployment insurance taxes by about 15 percent, Governor Whitman said.
The smokers' tax -- which will jump to 80 cents a pack on Jan. 1 -- will generate about $205 million a year in revenue, making New Jersey's cigarette tax the third highest in the nation, after Alaska and Washington State, and bringing the average cost of a pack of cigarettes to $2.75.

HEADLINE: Scholars Fear 'Star' System May Undercut Their Mission

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
Collectors bid on Picassos, baseball teams bid on batters, television networks bid on prime-time shows. Now, in the era of academic free agency, a few dozen top universities vie with increasing intensity for much admired, much resented "academostars."
Bidding wars break out regularly over molecular biologists, African-American historians, mathematicians, whoever university administrators believe possess the reputation and scholarly heft to lift a department or a school up a rung in the national rankings. 
 They cast their bids in the arcane currency of academic compensation: not just salary, but also course load, research assistance, laboratory space, semesters off, housing subsidies, travel budgets, jobs for spouses (and even, in one case, a job for a former spouse in a joint-custody divorce).
"It's very much a part of the late 20th century, this celebrity-itis," said Joyce Appleby, a professor of history at the University of California at Los Angeles. "It is the academic aspect of the fascination with instant gratification, competition and races for prestige and celebrity status."
Consider the middle-aged associate professor at a reputable state university, earning a perfectly respectable $43,000 a year. When his book became a finalist for two of the top prizes in his field, he was catapulted into the giddy world of academic stardom.
First, even before the book was out, his university promoted him and gave him a $10,000 raise. Then a top private university offered him an additional $25,000, a reduced teaching load, tuition for his children and guaranteed paid leave if he would defect.
His university countered, more or less matching the offer. So the professor decided not to leave. The next year, two Ivy League schools approached him, promising $15,000 more. Again, his university matched the offers. After some soul-searching, he stayed, feeling exhilarated but guilty.
"I'm simultaneously proud and embarrassed," said the professor, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. "You can't double your salary in two or three years and not think, 'Am I that much smarter than I was two or three years ago?' "
There is nothing new, of course, about academics with national reputations. What has changed is the competition for their services. Top universities have stepped up their longtime efforts to lure good people from lesser schools, while upwardly mobile, lesser schools have joined the fray.
What they are hunting for are scholars with big names in their field, people who win fellowships, publish prize-winning books, redefine their subjects, professors like Edward Said at Columbia, Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Cornel West at Harvard, or Judith Butler at the University of California at Berkeley.
Now Ms. Appleby is one of a number of scholars who have begun making the case in recent months that the star system is poisoning academic life, widening the gulf between the haves and have-nots and undermining the ideal of parity they say is basic to building community and morale.
The system rewards trendiness over less flashy virtues, critics say; it devalues the more ordinary hard work of academic life; it adds pressure on universities to do even more fund-raising, subtly eroding their independence, and it diverts attention from scholarship to the prestige attached to it.
Now that outside offers have become the route to a pay raise at home, some professors seem to flirt perpetually with suitors. That practice, critics say, breeds disloyalty, alienation and an insidious form of keeping up with the Joneses.
"There is a lot of low-level complaining and bitterness on many campuses about stars," said Cary Nelson, a professor of liberal arts and sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who published an article about academic superstars in the magazine Academe earlier this year. "But academia has not found a good way to discuss them openly. There's a tremendous amount of ill will but not a lot of open confrontation."
At the same time, many scholars concede that the star system can work. They say most stars are brilliant and highly productive; they have the power to attract gifted graduate students, reinvigorate departments, improve rankings, make alumni proud and make it easier to raise money.
 
A Flood of Celebrities Raises Duke's Rating
The classic case in point is literary studies at Duke University, which was transformed after the arrival of Prof. Frank Lentricchia in 1985 led to the hiring of two big stars, Stanley Fish and Fredric Jameson, to head the English department and the program in literature, respectively.
Their coming brought others, including Barbara Herrnstein Smith, Eve Kosovsky Sedgwick and Mr. Gates (whom Harvard then lured away to do for African-American studies what Mr. Fish had done for English, and who has since become arguably the best-known academic celebrity of all).
The Duke department skyrocketed to near the top of the national rankings. According to Mr. Fish, the number of graduate-student applications rose by 300 to 400 percent over six or seven years. Now, he said, newly minted Duke Ph.D.'s regularly get jobs at Yale, Harvard and the University of California at Berkeley.
"The sheer number of academic stars is the principal determinant of the public's assessment of the quality of a department," said Jonathan Cole, the Columbia University provost. "In academic life, you're known for your best, not for your average."
The star system can be traced, in part, to economic pressures squeezing universities and the pervasiveness of marketing in American life. Some specifically blame the preoccupation of administrators with rankings done by academic groups and publications like U.S. News & World Report.
But something else has changed, too. David R. Shumway, an associate professor in the English department at Carnegie Mellon University, says that the rise of the conference and lecture circuits has helped create a new form of academic celebrity akin to movie and rock stardom.
In a paper published in January in the journal Publications of the Modern Language Association, Mr. Shumway described Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, as "the jet-set academic, a professor who seems to spend more time in the air between gigs than on the ground at any particular job."
Long magazine profiles illustrated with photographs of tousled scholars in black turtlenecks have helped personalize their images, Mr. Shumway suggested. And recent trends in scholarship have placed issues like gender and sexuality at the center of certain fields..
"One might hazard a guess that the public visibility of the stars in some ways came about because it was the way the press preferred to deal with them," Mr. Shumway said, "rather than to engage the difficult and arcane matters that they actually write about."
Who becomes a "poster professor," as the new breed has been called by Jeffrey Williams, a professor of English at East Carolina University who also coined the term academostar? Most tend to be in their 40's and 50's and in mid-career; their research is cutting-edge; many are in trendy fields like environmental history or ethnic studies with a lot of student interest and not enough teachers.
Visibility helps. Stars write articles that regularly make a splash. They appear at conferences, where they are often used to draw a crowd. Some write for mainstream publications like The New Yorker, The New Republic and The New York Review of Books. Their books win important prizes.
Alan Taylor, a 42-year-old professor of history at the University of California at Davis, was approached by several universities, including Harvard, in the first six months after his book "William Cooper's Town" won the Pulitzer, the Bancroft and other top prizes last year.
Harvard offered Mr. Taylor a raise if he would come. U.C. Davis matched the offer and gave him a research fund of about $5,000. In return for deciding to stay, Mr. Taylor also got U.C. Davis to create fellowships to support three graduate students in American history.
"I have to recognize that what I'm being paid to do is in some ways different than most faculty," Mr. Taylor said. "In part, I'm being paid to be something of a marquee name that the university can use for its development as an indicator of the overall quality of the university.
"So I have certain responsibilities: to be available to speak on public occasions, to speak to alumni groups, to cooperate with the development office and the public relations office. I am being rewarded in part for being this sort of figure on the campus."
Richard White, a 50-year-old professor of history at the University of Washington who specializes in environmental, Native American and the "new Western history", won a MacArthur "genius" grant in 1995 and has since been offered jobs by Yale, Harvard and Stanford.
"There can be a usual-suspects syndrome," he said. "People consult me all the time about who they should recruit if they have an endowed chair. The same names come up over and over. So there is a sense of chasing the same people. And in some cases, while these people might talk, they aren't movable."
The pursuit of superstars happens at particular moments, when, for example, several big-name professors are retiring and need to be replaced, or when a new administration comes in and opens a campaign to jump-start a school or improve its rankings.
Allen L. Sessoms became president of Queens College in 1995 and set about trying to push the college into the top 1 percent of colleges by the year 2000. One short-term strategy, he said in an interview, was "to pull in a star who makes a statement about the quality of the institution."
So he began looking for donors to endow chairs, a popular method of drawing in the money needed to snare a high-priced star. Then, the college recruited Luc Montagnier, a co-discoverer of the AIDS virus, to fill the college's first fully endowed chair.
Mr. Montagnier's salary will be 50 percent higher than the usual $100,000 salary for distinguished professors at the college. Mr. Sessoms said that he would receive another $100,000 to cover expenses; that he would help fill five new faculty positions, and that he would have a $30 million AIDS research institute built for him.
One of the most widely criticized perks that some stars receive is a reduced teaching load. Arnold Weber, a former president of Northwestern University, recalls a faculty member's asking him to match an outside offer he had received that included not only a pay increase but also five years without teaching.
"In one of our finer moments, we said no," Mr. Weber recalled. And, he said, the professor left.
Thomas Bender, dean for the humanities at New York University, said that deals of that sort were "a real corruption that cannot be defended." He continued, "It makes one ask why are you recruiting a person of this quality if you are not then going to have them in the classroom."
 
Questioning A Market Model
A More than any other reaction, the star system engenders mixed emotions. More power to anyone in a captive labor market who ends up well paid, some professors say; if stars bring a university fame, energy, better graduate students and good faculty, everyone benefits.
At the same time, many wonder whether the market is the wrong model for faculty recruiting. As Ms. Appleby put it, the market ignores qualities that universities value, like the nurturing of talents over a lifetime and the development of certain intellectual values.
"By adopting the market as a model, universities have turned recruitment into a national competition, much like college sports," she wrote in a recent column in a newsletter published by the American Historical Association, the historians' organization of which she is president.
"Where once universities relied upon their location, reputation, facilities and student body to attract new faculty members," she continued, "today they are spending university money on 'off-scale' salaries, negotiated promotions and reduced teaching loads that will drain budgets for years to come."

DEMANDING MEDICAL EXCELLENCE
 Doctors and Accountability
 in the Information Age.
 By Michael L. Millenson.

 American medicine is in the throes of two great and wrenching transformations. The first -- the shift to health maintenance organizations (H.M.O.'s) and for-profit managed-care corporations -- is well known. But to most people the second may come as a total surprise. It is the systematic attempt to make doctors, hospitals and other medical-care organizations practice medicine consistently on the basis of the best scientific evidence, set up systems to measure the quality of what they do, analyze the outcomes to determine what really works and then share that information with patients and the public. It is a process without a convenient label, but Michael L. Millenson sums it up in a handy phrase: "doing the right thing and doing the right thing right."
But isn't that what doctors and hospitals have always done? Well, not exactly. Millenson, a science journalist who is now a senior analyst with the consulting company William M. Mercer Inc., begins "Demanding Medical Excellence" by taking us back to the bad old days before managed care, when the more health providers did -- the more operations, the more procedures, the more tests, the more hospitalizations -- the more money they made and the more the nation's health-care bill soared. The crisis in costs came recently. As Millenson reminds us, it was at least 30 years ago that a greater danger to patient care began to draw attention: the astonishing variability in doctors' everyday practices. (In one study, doctors were found to recommend 180 different treatment regimens for the same garden-variety urinary tract infection). For the patient, geography (and the "practice style" of the physician) was destiny. Citizens in northeastern Pennsylvania were 25 percent more likely to have surgery than the average state resident. In one part of Minnesota, 9 percent of births were by Caesarian section; in another, 48 percent. Worse, Millenson shows, even as recently as five years ago many doctors were not employing (or did not even know about) proven treatments for life-threatening illnesses, things as simple as using clot-busting drugs at the onset of a heart attack and prescribing aspirin thereafter. (In smaller hospitals and even in renowned medical centers, hospital-caused infections still result in nearly 20,000 deaths a year.)
By the mid-1980's, big corporations were insisting that they got more -- and better quality -- when they bought health insurance for their employees, driven both by the need to control costs and by the belief that costs could be cut safely if good medical science were the central focus. To take the reader, step by step, from the bad old days to the present, Millenson mixes patients' case histories, accounts of struggles with reluctant doctors to reform care in hospitals, explanations of the computer-based revolution in gathering information and analyzing data, and exhaustive citations from medical journals. Quality assurance systems and clinical practice guidelines are clearly, even vividly, explained, as are systems to insure public accountability -- since the early 1990's, New York State, for example, has been collecting data on the death rates, hospital by hospital, for heart bypass surgery, and releasing the information for publication in the press.
This is an exciting and important story -- and I wish it had been told more swiftly and economically. The reader has to get through this forest one tree at a time, and what is exhaustive ultimately becomes exhausting. There are also some serious omissions. This exuberant and optimistic report deals only glancingly with the fact that what the author describes as "a gathering revolution" has little relevance to the 41 million Americans who lack health insurance and have great difficulty in getting any medical care at all.
Finally, when Millenson turns to the advent of for-profit H.M.O.'s and hospitals -- that is, to health care as a marketplace commodity -- his analysis, in my view, is seriously flawed. He notes the criticisms of managed care -- 24-hour "drive-through deliveries," restrictions on choice of physician, denials of referrals to specialists -- and then dismisses many of them as "knee-jerk" and sensational journalism. He acknowledges that in many managed-care systems, "unknown to patients, the more care they get, the more money their doctors can lose," but argues that that this arrangement can "produce dramatic results" in cost containment.
But what about the fact that the salaries of the chief executive officers at the nation's 35 largest for-profit H.M.O.'s increased 32 percent in 1996, to an average of $1.3 million (not counting another $70 million in stock options)? What about the share of the health insurance premium that goes to stockholder profits rather than medical care?
Is marketplace medicine "an example of compassionate capitalism"? To his credit, Millenson does not think it is, though on occasion his corporate language can be jarring. While he characterizes as "penny pinching" the proposition that "an H.M.O.'s putting up bureaucratic barriers to needed medical care is little different in kind from an auto insurer's mandating that accident damage be repaired with inexpensive replacement parts or a home insurer's paying only for cheaper building materials," I find the formulations chilling, as a physician and as a sometime patient.
On balance, however, there is everything to applaud in the many-faceted efforts to ground every physician's practice in sound medical science, to monitor the quality of performance meticulously, to measure the results and to make that information widely available. Achievements like these require organizations; there are more than 2,000 medical research studies published each month, and no doctor can single-handedly review -- let alone apply -- all the new knowledge even in a small subspecialty. But there is more than one avenue to change. As Millenson himself briefly notes, the quality-control techniques that he hails are in use in other countries -- countries that have universal health insurance coverage and major government roles in health care. The two transformations -- better medicine at lower cost, on the one hand, and market-driven managed care, on the other -- are not inevitably linked.

HEADLINE: Washington Discovers Christian Persecution

BYLINE: By Jeffrey Goldberg; Jeffrey Goldberg is a contributing writer for the Magazine. His last article, about the Palestinian secret police force, appeared in September.

 BODY:
The sour expression on his gray and lined face suggests that His Eminence Lufti Laham, the visiting patriarchal vicar for the Orthodox Melkite Church in Jerusalem, disapproves of Nina Shea -- her message, her demeanor, even her presence on the same dais.
Shea is a stone-serious conservative Catholic, the religion expert at the human rights group Freedom House and a leader in the fight against the persecution of Christians overseas. Archbishop Laham represents a group of West Bank Christians who are experiencing growing discrimination from their fundamentalist Muslim neighbors. And yet Laham appears physically pained each time Shea mentions the word "persecution." 
 Shea is speaking to the Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem, a group of self-described knights who claim spiritual descendance from the infidel-smiting Crusaders of yore. They have invited her to their annual international convention, in a suburban hotel in Washington, to educate them about human rights. Her message is straightforward: Millions of Christians are now facing horrible persecution, most notably in many Muslim countries and in China, but American human rights advocates are blinded to this by their secular-humanist impulses. The American Government, meanwhile, seems far more interested in opening new trade markets than in defending human rights.
Shea belongs to a new and potent political coalition that includes Reaganite conservatives, labor activists, veterans of the Soviet Jewry movement and, most important, evangelical Christians. These unlikely partners are united by their desire to "remoralize" American foreign policy. Within the past year, they have seized an issue, Christian persecution, that existed on the margins of the human rights agenda and yanked it to the center of America's foreign policy debate. They are now focused on passing the Freedom From Religious Persecution Act, which is opposed by the White House, big business and, surprisingly, several Christian groups.
"On a demographic scale, Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the world today," Shea now tells the knights. "I'm talking about the most egregious violations known to man. I'm talking about slavery, torture, arrest, imprisonment, even martyrdom."
When Shea mentions martyrdom, Archbishop Laham lets out a sigh. It is not that he objects to the notion of martyrdom. ("Martyrdom is glorious," he later tells the knights.) He does object to Shea's confrontational tone. He, after all, is the one living with the possibility of persecution at the hands of intolerant neighbors. As Laham steps up to the podium, he makes a detour to a table laden with books. He picks up Shea's recent book about Christian persecution, "In the Lion's Den," and another book on the subject, "Their Blood Cries Out." The archbishop turns to the audience, theatrically mournful. "These titles," he says, "are not helpful."
By the time the meeting ends, Shea is quietly steaming. We have a lot of opposition," she mutters as she moves toward the door. And this" -- she nods in the direction of the archbishop, a man she believes needs her help -- "is the sort of thing we're up against."
The idea that Christians are the subject of persecution is difficult to grasp at first. After all, there are more Christians in the world than members of any other faith, and Christianity has historically (witness the Inquisition) and recently (think Bosnia) been more closely associated with the persecutors than with the persecuted. But Christians have, of course, been brutalized in the past (the Roman Colosseum comes to mind). And today, in countries where Christians are in the minority, they often face all manner of oppression. On this point, at least, there is wide agreement among church and human rights groups.
"To suggest that the persecution of Christians is not a serious problem is nonsense," says William F. Schulz, the executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A., in a rebuke to anyone who might suggest otherwise.
It is difficult, though, to quantify a problem that takes different forms in different countries. Unlike a tightly focused human rights campaign -- the movement to force the Soviet Union to let Jews emigrate, for instance -- this is a diffuse cause. Activists say that as many as 200 million Christians in at least 35 countries live under governments that abet persecution.
The persecution of Christians is said to be especially ferocious in the Islamic world. In Pakistan, churches have been burned and Christians have been jailed on charges of blasphemy and beaten to death by Muslim mobs. The most dangerous country in the world for Christians is surely the Sudan, where the Christians of the south are targets of a near-genocidal campaign by Muslim northerners. Paul Marshall, author of "Their Blood Cries Out" and a senior fellow at the Institute of Christian Studies in Toronto, estimates that 700,000 Christians have died in the eight years since Muslim fundamentalists seized power in the Sudan. "More die from hunger than from bullets," Marshall says, but adds that armed Government militiamen often surround villages on horseback, kill the men and kidnap the children to forcibly convert them to Islam. Even in countries that are strong U.S. allies, Christians often face brutalization. Human rights groups have accused the Government of Saudi Arabia of beheading Christians; in Egypt, Coptic Christians are not allowed to build or repair churches without the permission of President Hosni Mubarak. Not that Muslim countries are the only ones charged with Christian persecution. According to Human Rights Watch, the leading U.S. human rights group, Communist officials in China have been shutting down Protestant and Catholic churches that refuse to affiliate with the Government and arresting ministers and priests.
To suggest, however, that Christian persecution is the most egregious human rights problem in the world is simplistic hype. Religious persecution seldom takes place in a vacuum. Countries like the Sudan, China and Cuba, all of which oppress Christians with vigor, regularly violate almost every recognizable human right. How, then, does one categorize a Catholic priest who is thrown in jail for attacking the government: as a religious martyr or a political prisoner -- or both?
Several of the countries accused of persecuting Christians dispute the human rights groups' charges, and some see a pro-Israel plot behind Washington's sudden interest in the plight of Middle East Christians. Abdelaleem El-Abyad, a spokesman for the Egyptian Embassy in Washington, noted that several of the politicians and activists at the forefront of the movement are Jewish. "This crusade is like a jihad," says El-Abyad. "These Jewish extremists think they can help Israel by tarnishing Islam."
It is not only Arab publicists who are finding secret plots behind the campaign against Christian persecution. At the moment, the main target of the pro-Christian campaign is China. Beijing's advocates in the U.S., including many Fortune 500 companies, see distinctly political, and not humanitarian, motivations behind the evangelical right's interest in China. "I suspect that there are those in this town who think, incorrectly, that China is the new evil empire," says Willard A. Workman, the vice president for international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "China is not unique in the world in having some interesting views on religious-freedom issues."
"Interesting views" is, charitably, an understatement, but the extent of Chinese persecution of Christians is nevertheless a matter of debate. Even the number of Christians in China is a matter of debate. (Estimates range from 14 million to 100 million.) When asked to describe the state of religious freedom in China, John Shattuck, the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, said bad. Then Shattuck, who is the White House's point man in its effort to defeat the Wolf-Specter bill, quickly added: "But it has been bad for some time." In fact, Human Rights Watch recently reported that incidents of long-term imprisonment and physical violence directed against religious activists are less frequent in China today than in years past.
Nina Shea puts little stock in this sort of report. "Human Rights Watch has no contacts in this community," she says. "They don't know what's going on." She then offers up a bundle of internal Chinese Government documents detailing Beijing's belief that underground Christianity is a serious threat to the leadership's ideology.
Shea often claims that more Christians have suffered persecution in this century than in all previous centuries combined. Such statements leave Shea's more analytical -- and secular-minded -- colleagues somewhat discomforted. "It's a great one-liner," says Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, "but I'm not sure it's true."
Shea dismisses Roth's criticism as the bitter plaint of a man who failed to predict the next great human rights battle. "No one is paying attention to anything they say or do or write anyway," she says about Human Rights Watch. "I've got the numbers, I've got the endorsements in all the Christian communities. I've got the power. It's our side that is setting the agenda now."
Christian persecution should not, by rights, be an issue of great controversy. After all, no one favors the persecution of Christians, in the same way that no one opposes clean water or supports nuclear warfare. But the unlikely coalition that Shea has helped put together is plainly working on some powerful political and commercial nerves, and has run into fevered opposition from another unlikely coalition. Besides the leaders of China and several Muslim countries, this coalition includes the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the liberal National Council of Churches and several Christian leaders who believe that martyrdom, like the everlasting presence of the poor, is biblically preordained.
These forces are all fighting the proposed Freedom From Religious Persecution Act, which would create an office to monitor religious persecution and sanction countries that systematically persecute any religious group (including Iranian Bahais and Tibetan Buddhists). Opponents of the bill, which is sponsored by Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican, and Representative Frank Wolf, a Virginia Republican, managed to keep it from coming to a vote in the last session of Congress. But its sponsors promise to push it hard after Congress reconvenes in January.
With thousands of lay Catholics and Protestant ministers having joined the fight against Christian persecution, it might be seen as a genuinely mass movement. But it's hardly a movement that arose by spontaneous combustion in some church basement. Midwifed by a handful of veteran organizers, this is an issue manufactured in the mile-square section of Washington that produces the most priceless of political commodities: the wedge issue. It is a process of political manufacturing that Washington seems to have perfected, the taking of a simple, transparently righteous issue and turning into a political football.
For the Republican Party, the Wolf-Specter bill sets up a potentially calamitous gunfight between the party's social conservatives (millions of Christian foot soldiers) and its economic conservatives (big-business supporters). This new movement also threatens to put the President in a political squeeze. His State Department opposes Wolf-Specter, primarily because the bill calls for the automatic trigger of sanctions, and because of fears that an office devoted to religious persecution would create what Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright calls "an artificial hierarchy of human rights," the elevation of one class of persecuted people over another. So if the legislation does make it through Congress, the President might risk alienating a wide swath of Christian America with his veto.
All this angst, generated by a political issue that barely existed a year ago.
To the extent that the cause did exist, it existed in nina Shea's briefcase. Shea first came to the human rights movement in the late 1970's. She was, by all appearances, a typical activist. She served as a program director for the International League for Human Rights, a group founded by the impeccably liberal Roger Baldwin, who also founded the A.C.L.U. In the early 80's, Shea, a lapsed Catholic, became increasingly interested in the human rights abuses committed by the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, especially toward priests.
"I tried to interest the human rights community in the situation in Nicaragua, and that's when I got blackballed by them," Shea says now. She is a slight, blond mother of three who seems hardened by years of ideological infighting. "They all but stopped talking to me." In response, Shea and a number of other lay Catholics formed the Puebla Institute, dedicated to advancing the cause of religious freedom. (Puebla was later absorbed by Freedom House, where Shea now works.) "There were already groups set up to do journalists, to do lawyers," she says. "No one was doing religion." Along the way, she says, her work drew her back to her religion. "I was evangelized by the persecuted people. This work really provoked something in me."
It didn't provoke much elsewhere. Puebla and several other groups kept the pilot light lit, but the late 1980's were lean years for Christian human rights activists. The broader human rights movement was preoccupied with apartheid in South Africa, war in Central America and the Soviet oppression of Jews, Poland and the Baltic states. But by 1991, Shea says, "the bottom had begun to fall out" on each of those issues. And yet, while disparate historical forces were helping clear the table of traditional human rights concerns, the issue of Christian persecution stayed on the margins. To Shea, this was evidence of class bias. She believes that the mainstream human rights groups, and their foundation backers, exhibit a cultural distaste for religious people, especially for evangelicals.
"To them, since I focused on Christians, I was a bigot," Shea says, bitterness rising in her throat. "No one would call me a bigot if I decided to commit my life to Tibetan Buddhists. It's a common view of human rights advocates -- they think of Christians as persecutors, not the persecuted."
Michael J. Horowitz believes that one activist alone was responsible for moving the issue of Christian persecution into the mainstream: Michael J. Horowitz. The former general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget under Reagan, he is now a senior fellow specializing in tort reform at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. He is wire-thin, an aerobic talker and an expert self-publicist. "When I came on the scene," he says, "there were groups doing this, but they were going out of business. Puebla was one of those groups that was dying. Nina is good, but it was going out of business."
Horowitz, a self-described "backsliding Orthodox Jew," was alerted to Christian persecution by his Ethiopian housekeeper, who told him stories about the suffering of Christians under Ethiopia's Communist rulers. Those stories, he says, took him to Nina Shea's office one day in late 1995. "Evangelicals were with us on Soviet Jewry, and it was time to pay them back," he says. "You're only allowed to sit out one Holocaust each lifetime."
Shea educated Horowitz about Christian persecution, and it was this collaboration that set into motion much that would follow. Horowitz and Shea's relationship has since deteriorated; Shea has difficulty squelching her apparent distaste for Horowitz's self-promotion, and she resents his backhanded compliments. "Puebla was not dying until Michael came along," she says dismissively. And Michael would have died without this issue. What did he have, tort reform?"
Still, they formed a partnership for a time, and Shea still credits Horowitz with devising a uniquely effective strategy to enlist Christian leaders. "Michael's contribution was that he called these people and said, 'I'm a Jew, I'm interested in this, why aren't you?' " Shea says. "He shamed Christian leaders into action." Horowitz became a tireless spokesman for their cause. The New York Times columnist A. M. Rosenthal, who has returned to the subject of Christian persecution again and again over the past year, wrote that Horowitz "screamed me awake" about Christian persecution.
In January 1996, Shea, Horowitz and several other activists, including officials of the National Association of Evangelicals, convened a conference of Christian leaders. More than 100 came, including many influential evangelists, like Charles Colson, as well as evangelists unknown in official Washington but who reach millions from their televised pulpits. After the conference, the Association released a "statement of conscience," calling on churches across the country to pressure the Administration to combat religious persecution abroad. Suddenly, the movement had found its masses.
The movement has also found its enemies, and not just the ruling cabals in Beijing and Khartoum. The faith-based human rights insurgency sees the liberal human rights establishment, especially Human Rights Watch, as its bete noire. By way of introducing himself, Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, hands over a two-inch-thick stack of documents. They detail his group's efforts to expose religious persecution around the world, efforts starting long before Nina Shea and Michael Horowitz cast him as the opposition.
Horowitz dismisses Roth's pile of evidence. "The elitist human rights groups have got it all wrong," Horowitz says. "It's their crowd that has caused more holocausts than the Christian Coalition crowd. They are children of the Enlightenment view that religious people are the ones doing the persecuting. At one point I was talking to Roth and he said, 'Maybe we could have some sort of meeting.' I said, 'Fine, how would you like to meet with Ralph Reed?' On the other end of the telephone, the gulp was so clear that it was if I asked him how he'd like to meet with salmonella. God forbid he should meet with Ralph Reed. He said, 'Well, what's his position on abortion?' Position on abortion? What has that got to do with political oppression?"
Roth, a lanky, earnest man who has run Human Rights Watch for four years, remembers the conversation differently. "I said I'd be happy to meet with him and bring the Christian Coalition into the movement, but not embrace it, because it rejects certain human rights, which is what its position on abortion reflects," he says. "The evangelical right has certain views which are contrary to the views of the human rights movement, around the issue of the rights of women, and around the issue of religious tolerance, but we are here to defend the rights of all, including the intolerant. But Horowitz is on his own thing, and he has a very selective memory."
To the class-centered charges leveled by Shea and Horowitz, Roth responds: "These are self-congratulatory applause lines, to say that we weren't involved in religious rights. But they have chosen to pursue divisive tactics. It gets a rise out of certain constituencies -- I can't imagine they'd be saying this sort of thing if they didn't get a rise."
Gary Bauer, the president of the Family Research Council, is a slight and polite man, as relaxed as Michael Horowitz is frenetic. But his low-key presence belies his influence in conservative Christian circles and his understanding of how evangelical activists can manipulate the legislative levers on Capitol Hill. In the executive suite of the Council's imposing downtown Washington headquarters, Bauer recounts the recent history of evangelical politicization.
"There's a growing awareness by Christians that you can't compartmentalize your faith," he explains. "You've got the Promise Keepers saying that faith has to define what kind of father and husband you are, and now you have the movement to stop the persecution of Christians saying your faith has to define what sort of citizen you are. If that means becoming a human rights activist, so be it."
Bauer, improbably, has become a human rights activist. This activism began a few years ago, during the debate over whether to continue China's most-favored-nation trading status. Bauer is a close friend and ideological soul mate of William Kristol, the Republican theoretician and editor of The Weekly Standard. Both men were disappointed that the Republicans failed to have China punished; the party, they agreed, had been captured by greedy, amoral businessmen. They wondered aloud if it might be possible to restore a measure of Reaganite greatness to the G.O.P. by casting the Communists in Beijing as Soviet-style enemies.
Bauer's interest in confronting China as a Communist enemy coincided with Shea and Horowitz's interest in confronting China as an enemy of Christians. Bauer, who is frequently mentioned in conservative circles as a potential Presidential candidate in 2000, understood that Christian persecution might well be Beijing's Achilles' heel. "I decided to see if I could get my own supporters around the country interested," he recalls, "and if I could gain credibility in Washington on this issue."
Foreign policy, however, had never held much interest for evangelical activists. True, Israel has always been important, for eschatalogical reasons, and the Soviet Union was often seen as a biblically predestined evil empire. (Ronald Reagan quite deliberately introduced this now-iconic expression at an evangelical convention.) But evangelical leaders were primarily motivated by domestic issues. That, however, has been changing. "Twenty years ago," says Kristol, "they focused on the issues most immediate to them -- schools, abortion. But the Republican Party is going to wake up and realize that the dominance of big business has caused great unhappiness under the surface."
Once the National Association of Evangelicals issued its statement of conscience, Bauer and other activists had a surprisingly easy time enlisting evangelical Christians to their cause. "The Republican Party will be forced to make a decision about what it is," Bauer says. "Is it the party of Lincoln and Reagan or the party of Wall Street and the Fortune 500? This issue is creating incredible strains within the G.O.P. alliance."
A particularly striking moment for Bauer came when he read the comments of the chairman and C.E.O. of the Boeing Company, Philip M. Condit, in this magazine last August. Condit was asked his thoughts about human rights violations in China. He responded: "They are the same ones that I have about human rights violations in the United States. . .I happened to be in China during the Rodney King beating. Now, there is a whole bunch of background that goes along with that. But watching that on CNN in China, their perspective was, 'What was that about?"'
"I almost fell out of my chair when I read that," says Bauer. "It's a viciously anti-American statement by a man whose company is on the map because America had the will to arm in order to face down international Communism. It's just astonishing. It will get more amazing if China does what I think it will do over the next 10 to 15 years. And then we'll have Boeing up to Congress demanding a military buildup to counter the Chinese threat that they helped create by sending our technology to them."
Though Bauer refuses to talk about it, he is paying a price for his newfound interest in human rights. His allies say he has come under pressure from his organization's biggest supporters, the DeVos family, one of the founders of Amway. The company did $178 million in business in China last year, and Bauer's friends say he has been asked to tone down his anti-China rhetoric. John Gartland, Amway's director of government affairs, denies that the DeVos family is pressuring Bauer. "We have never told him he has to do this or that," he says, but then adds, "though in this particular case, we've made our views known that we don't agree with him."
Bauer clearly hasn't backed off. Which is what led to a strange sight several weeks ago. During the visit of the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, to Washington, there stood Gary Bauer alongside Richard Gere and Bianca Jagger, those avatars of the celebrity left, to protest the Administration's red-carpet treatment of a man Bauer calls "the Butcher of Beijing."
"It was a little jarring," Bauer says now, "but throughout American history, great causes have seen the formation of unusual coalitions and the breaking up of other coalitions."
It is difficult to plumb someone else's motives. Michael Horowitz and Nina Shea are obviously moved by the plight of oppressed people. But they make it plain, just as Gary Bauer makes it plain, that their defense of persecuted Christians is a means to an end, the end being to overturn the established -- that is, liberal -- order. When Shea and Horowitz look at Human Rights Watch, the National Council of Churches, even the U.S. State Department, they see organizations driven by a class-based secular humanism. In Shea's view, many in the human rights establishment "buy into the argument put forward by the Chinese Government that religion has to be controlled because it's dangerous and that there are dangerous sects out there."
But some liberal Christians see danger closer to home -- in the movement that Shea and Horowitz have spearheaded. "There is reason to be concerned with this overly muscular Christianity that is being advocated," says the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, the general secretary of the National Council of Churches. "That's got some history to it. When Christians act like their faith is pre-eminent, it can create problems. I hate to use this example because it's so extreme, but if you look at the Nazi regime, you see in it the philosophy of Christian superiority."
The emphasis on persecuted Christians, suggests Campbell, is theologically arrogant. "We are equally concerned about persecution of any faith," she says. "The persecution of Christians is not a primary concern. If we as Americans are not careful, we will create a more repressive situation for Christians."
To Horowitz, Campbell has it exactly wrong. "When Joan talks about Christianity as a precursor to the Holocaust," he says, "she ignores Nietzsche, who predicted that the Christian God in Europe would be replaced by a secular god and that the totalitarian clergyman would be replaced by the totalitarian politician, and then the blood would really flow. And it did."
Horowitz, like several other conservative Jewish thinkers, has come to believe that Christian anti-Semitism is a less malignant form of the disease. (He and several other Jewish conservatives are pressuring the U.S. Holocaust Museum to soften its depiction of Christian anti-Semitism.) But what does the persecution of Jews have to do with the movement to address the persecution of Christians?
"This issue is not just about saving the lambs," Horowitz says. "The question is, what does religion stand for? Is it a retrograde force of superstition, or is it a source of modernity and democracy and ultimately tolerance? I say the latter, and we're seeing the greatest expansion of Christianity in its lifetime." Horowitz, it turns out, is enthusiastic about the spread of Christianity. "Evangelicals will be the Jews of the 21st century," he says, praising them as carriers of the Judeo-Christian ideal of individual rights and democracy. "The reason we have democracy is that the Judeo-Christian ethic taught the most radical political philosophy of all -- that all men are created equal before God."
Before Horowitz can help plant the flag of evangelism in Tiananmen Square, there are some considerably less philosophical objections he must overcome.
As evangelical Christians began lobbying their representatives to pass the Wolf-Specter bill, a coalition of business groups was already implementing a counteroffensive. Worried about the effect of this and other legislation on trade with China (among other countries), hundreds of corporations had created a lobbying group called USA Engage. To Horowitz's surprise, the lobby was able to persuade many legislators that Wolf-Specter threatened free trade. In fact, the original Wolf-Specter bill proposed in May contained provisions for only limited sanctions. The more significant thrust of the bill was the creation of a White House office to monitor persecution. If that office found evidence of religious persecution, it would call for sanctions against the offending government, including a ban on nonhumanitarian aid.
Business lobbyists, though, convinced some legislators that Wolf-Specter would impose crippling trade sanctions, and Gary Bauer, for one, was feeling the heat of free-trader anger. "I'm understanding the Republican Party a little better after being steam-rollered for the third time on this issue," he says dryly.
But business leaders were not the only ones nervous about the new emphasis on Christian persecution. To the horror of the movement's supporters, the Rev. Billy Graham's son, Nelson, who controls a ministry in Asia, publicly cast scorn on the movement. "As evangelical Christians, we should be about God's work," he wrote to his supporters, "sharing the gospel of God's love in a lost world, being His ambassadors and helping the world see that Christians are spiritual salt and light, not destructive political tools."
According to their critics in the evangelical movement, and there are many, the Grahams have a well-known history of preaching in totalitarian countries without paying too much attention to human rights abuse. Still, the business coalition opposing Wolf-Specter was able to trumpet the Grahams' discontent with the bill as proof that evangelicals are divided on it.
As summer turned to fall, hopes for a quick passage of Wolf-Specter faded. Frank Wolf, eager to see the bill passed in even a compromised form, agreed to water it down, moving the proposed monitoring office from the White House to the State Department. But even with this and other key concessions, Congressional leaders kept the bill from coming to a vote. Now, with the bill coming up again for consideration, Gary Bauer is warning opponents that the price of passing the legislation might ultimately be less than they'd pay for sinking it. "The overall issue is now deeply rooted in the evangelical community," he says confidently. "This issue is not going away, and if the corporate elite wants it to be a major fault line in the Republican Party, then that's what it will be."
In February, around the time Wolf-Specter will likely go before Congress, religious leaders will hold a summit meeting in Washington to kick off a campaign that they promise will outflank the business interests. "There are a lot more churches in this country than there are chamber of commerce chapters," says Michael Horowitz. It will soon become clear if the issue that Horowitz and Shea have championed has truly taken root, if it has moved from the Beltway to the heartland. Even Horowitz wonders: "Is this like 'The Wizard of Oz,' a couple of people speaking into a trick microphone, or is it real?"
By many indications, including the constant discussions about persecution on Christian radio, it is real. Of course, it is a movement shot through with political opportunism, but that does not negate the fact that Christians from China to the Sudan might benefit from an America that is awake to their problem. That, of course, would be something of a miracle: Americans in the 1990's awake to any foreign policy concern. And it would be particularly miraculous for the human rights movement, which, as William Schulz of Amnesty International admits, "has inadequately developed a grass-roots constituency of any kind."
There is a cosmic joke being played on American human rights activists. For years, they have been looking for ways to interest middle America in its causes, not just college activists and the cultural elite. Finally, a mass constituency seems to be coming together, but -- and here's the punch line -- the mass constituency consists primarily of evangelical Protestant Republicans.
Schulz is untroubled by this reality. "I've always believed that the human rights movement is a most non-partisan movement," he says. "Who's in favor of torture, after all?"
Still, many in the human rights community are less than enthusiastic about the Christian right's newfound interest in human rights. This might indeed be the result, as Horowitz and Shea maintain, of cultural distaste. But there are other reasons as well. Many human rights activists cringe at the possibility of a Government-run office to monitor religious persecution, for other movements would surely demand the same treatment and create a bureaucratic morass. There is also the fear that Christian evangelicals, by their sheer numbers, could swamp the mainstream human rights movement.
But this view does not take into account two important facts. The first is that most people are drawn to human rights work by a parochial concern, and then learn -- and often embrace -- the larger cause. It is worth remembering that Gary Bauer, a leader of the Christian right, recently linked arms with robed Buddhists at a White House protest rally.
It is also worth remembering that left-leaning human rights activists and right-wing evangelicals are united, not separated, by another distaste. This distaste is directed toward an Administration and a Congress whose foreign policy seems dictated by trade concerns. "In this Administration," Schulz says, "trade always trumps torture when the two clash, and this causes dissatisfaction on the right and the left." That dissatisfaction may well be a harbinger of a momentous political trend, the creation of a new alliance in which secular liberals and religious conservatives join together to force Washington to worry as much about moral issues as the insatiable demands of turbocharged capitalism.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/Pendleton Place;
3 Houses That Recall 19th-Century Staten Island

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
PENDLETON PLACE, in the New Brighton section of Staten Island, is an unusual street, a curving residential block built by the Pendleton family in the 1850's and 1860's. Three of the family's buildings are left in recognizable form, and in the last two decades different owners have taken each down a different path of restoration. Together, they make an interesting study of varying opinions of what is important about a house.
In the mid-19th century, the north shore of Staten Island saw expanded development as a summer colony and even as a suburban residence for Manhattan commuters. According to research by the architectural historian Barnett Shepherd, director of Historic Richmond Town, in 1852 William S. Pendleton bought a large parcel at the northwest corner of Franklin and Prospect Avenues in New Brighton, and an 1853 land map shows a house where the neo-Gothic 22 Pendleton Place is now. 
 Pendleton, born in New York City in 1795, later became a pioneer lithographer in Boston. Wendy Shadwell, curator of prints at the New-York Historical Society, says that Pendleton's firm was the first successful lithography operation in America. She says that lithography was more flexible, faster and cheaper than reproducing images by engraving, and Pendleton made landscape scenes for framing, book illustrations and copies of famous artworks. He also took as his apprentice Nathaniel Currier, who later established his own lithography firm, Currier & Ives.
Pendleton moved back to New York in the 1840's. He bought other land in Staten Island as early as 1846, but it is not certain whether he ever lived at 22 Pendleton Place. He was involved with various businesses in Staten Island -- Mr. Shepherd's research indicates that Pendleton was also head of a ferry company.
In 1862 the magazine The Horticulturist published a sketch of a new, much bigger house on the Pendleton property, the giant stick-style residence now known as 1 Pendleton Place, designed by the architect Charles Duggin. The article describes it as "erected for renting," one of a group of seven homes put up by Pendleton.
Pendleton leased the large, asymmetrical house to Thomas M. Rianhard, a Manhattan wholesale merchant who left a rowhouse at 49 West 14th Street to move to Staten Island.
By the 1860's Pendleton and two sons were living in one or more houses they built on Pendleton Place, but an 1878 deed shows William S. Pendleton living in Florida. He died the next year. Other Pendleton family members continued to live in houses on Pendleton Place, and the family rented or sold others as circumstances required -- in the 1870's they sold the Gothic-style house at 22 Pendleton Place to William P. Raynor, a Manhattan envelope manufacturer.
Apparently it was the Raynors who installed the elegant Romanesque-style chimney breast in 22 Pendleton Place, a rich and elegant brick and terra-cotta work with round arches and zigzag flame details. Around 1907 Willard Boyd, a mechanical engineer, bought the house and installed a sophisticated arts-and-crafts-style mantelpiece on the second floor, made of green tile and black iron.
But other than that the Pendletons' two biggest houses, 1 and 22 Pendleton Place, remained almost unaltered, unusual in a borough that saw regular visits from aluminum-siding and home-improvement salesmen. Now scattered among later, smaller houses, three Pendleton houses are still evident: the two at 1 and 22 Pendleton Place, and one at 178 Franklin Avenue nearby.
RESTORATION on this last house, by Miller Richardson in the 1970's, began before work on the other two. Mr. Richardson, who studied architecture in the 1930's but hewed to the Classical style, says "there really wasn't much left to restore" in the squarish, shingled house. Vandals had removed the mid-19th-century mantels and other details, and he brought in Greek Revival pilasters and other details he salvaged from a house being demolished at the time.
With great care, he has installed these and other details -- such as a paneled door from an 1890's rowhouse with a lock from Madrid -- but the interior is still largely unfinished, without a final paint job, much furniture, window casings and, in some cases, window glass. The interior is crammed with striking artifacts from long trips -- a fossil from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, a medieval drinking tankard, a stone fragment from a church in Toledo, Spain -- and those from nearby, like a carved marble ornament from a neo-Gothic Staten Island church and an Indian stone scraping tool he dug out of the garden.
His garden is exquisite, with shaped fir trees that give it an Italian air. But when he talks about finishing the interiors of the 12-room house he pauses and says: "It really could have been great. I've struggled for quality, but I'm 83, and I've slowed down a bit. There's still a lot to be done."
When the Revs. John Walsted and Gerald Keucher, Episcopal priests, bought 1 Pendleton Place in 1983 for $91,000, they got a high-style Victorian house that was largely intact. But, Father Walsted said, "there were mushrooms growing on the walls" because of leaks. Like Mr. Richardson, they cleared away decades of growth around their house, but there was so little damage to the interior they had only to plaster and paint. The downstairs is done in yellow and three shades of plum, with vintage furniture and religious icons. Father Walsted retired in 1994 and now paints icons full time.
The house has its original marble mantels, deeply carved wooden trim and patterned floors in chestnut and black walnut; a fourth-floor eight-sided lookout has wide views of New York Harbor, New Jersey and the ship traffic on the Kill Van Kull. Father Walsted says that he and Father Keucher considered buying 22 Pendleton Place when it came on the market but discovered that the large furniture they had acquired "just wouldn't fit."
It was Edwin Calderon and John Amalfitano who bought 22 Pendleton Place in 1994, and they began an elaborate restoration program that is now about half-finished. A pipe scaffold surrounds the Gothic tower for dormer repairs, and the exterior has been stripped of later shingles and will be repainted the original green in warmer weather.
MR. CALDERON and Mr. Amalfitano, who work for organizations serving AIDS patients, have done much of the outside and almost all of the inside work themselves, to exacting but economical standards. They have finished the parlor, dining room and two bedrooms with a convincing combination of homemade stenciling, sponged paint jobs and a sophisticated color sense.
Although some furnishings, like an upstairs floral carpet, come from inexpensive outlets, nothing looks cheap or half-done. The dining room, a showpiece, took about 50 hours and a few thousand dollars. They truly savor both the original house and the work they have done, and they should -- it could compete with professionally restored Victorian-house museums.
Mr. Calderon and Mr. Amalfitano paid $190,000 for 22 Pendleton Place, after they stumbled on it when at a nearby yard sale. Their house and 1 Pendleton Place are included on a walking tour of Victorian houses today from 1 to 5 P.M. that benefits the Preservation League of Staten Island. Tickets are $12 ($20 for a family) and are available by calling (718) 720-1666.

HEADLINE: The Arts Find Fertile Ground In a Flourishing Ireland

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: DUBLIN

 BODY:
FOR MOST OF THIS CENTURY IT WAS easier to find Irish artists proclaiming their Irishness in London, Paris and New York than in Dublin. Quite simply, exile was preferable to the poverty, isolation, censorship and self-doubt prevailing at home. No longer. Today, Irish culture is flourishing as never before; impressive new talent is flowering in writing, movies, music, art -- and now it is happening in Ireland.
This cultural renaissance is more than a function of the irrepressible creative gifts of the Irish. It has come about because the country as a whole has experienced a metamorphosis. In barely a decade, the old Ireland that Wilde, Joyce and Beckett were so eager to flee has been replaced by a newly prosperous Ireland, brimming with optimism and self-confidence, in which artists have pride of place. 
 "Ireland in the 1970's bears very little resemblance to Ireland today," said Sebastian Barry, 42, one of several playwrights who has made his name in the 1990's. "It used to be so depressing. Not oppressive like Eastern Europe, just horribly unimpressive. It's almost a new nationality now."
For Irish artists, the change has brought an extraordinary sense of liberation -- from the need to emigrate or the certainty of penury if they stayed home; from the shadow of the Roman Catholic Church and old-fashioned nationalism; from the straitjacket of the past. Today, they feel free to express themselves. They are eager to be heard. And they are being rewarded with growing recognition abroad.
"If you surround huge areas of expression with silence for so long and then a society suddenly opens up," explained Colm Toibin, 42, one of several newly successful novelists, "a lot of people are going to start writing clearly and dramatically. That's what has happened here. When people talk of the death of the novel, I laugh. In Ireland, it's reaching a heroic phase, like in Britain and France 150 years ago."
Yet if this sudden change is celebrated, it has also set many Irish artists brooding over its significance, uncertain if they recognize Ireland in its new attire, confused by the clash of old and new identities. What does it mean to be Irish in an Ireland that is revising its perception of itself and the world? If the country buries its past, what will replace it? Can the Irish become modern without becoming less Irish?
The search for answers runs through much creative activity here today. New Irish novelists, playwrights, moviemakers and visual artists cannot be slotted into a single category because their concerns are so varied. Yet many share an obsessive need to look at Ireland and the Irish through fresh eyes, to explore subjects that were long taboo, to strip "Irishness" of its nationalistic and romantic myths and see what is left.
Plays and movies are daring to examine the civil war that followed Irish self-rule in the 1920's and the "troubles" that have convulsed Northern Ireland for most of the last 25 years. Artists are addressing such sensitive topics as the traditional power of the Catholic Church and the oppression of the Irish woman. But they are not returning to the past. Rather, the past is being dragged into the present to be dissected with today's instruments -- say, the drama of movies, the humor of plays or the symbolism of visual art.
The social upheaval of the last 10 years also poses a challenge to artists. Gone is the old rural Ireland of "cottage, donkey and church," as one painter put it. Today, a newly urbanized country is being bombarded by American popular culture and has become transfixed by money. It is a society where drugs, violence and corruption have taken root. This may provide artists with rich raw material, but it is also disquieting. Where, they ask, is it all leading?
 
Ireland Begins to Examine Itself
 For all the theatricality of its grand entrance, new Ireland has been in the making since 1973 when the country joined the European Community. As the community's poorest member, one that had changed little in generations, the Republic of Ireland began to receive massive aid to modernize its roads, airports and communications. By the mid-1980's, foreign investment was pouring in, attracted by cheap labor and tax incentives. By the early 1990's, Ireland could boast Europe's fastest-growing economy, its per capita income even exceeding that of Britain.
And more than the economy was changing. Increased spending on schools brought a marked rise in educational standards, while depopulation of the countryside accelerated. Meanwhile, the power of the Catholic Church was crumbling, family size was shrinking and divorce was finally legalized. The old political establishment, in power since the 1930's, was losing its hold on the country. Even traditional hostility toward Britain began to wane.
"In the 1970's, we still had an inferiority complex toward the English," explained Michael Colgan, the director of the Gate Theater in Dublin, "and we measured our Irishness by how much we hated them. But in the 1980's, a series of 'accidents,' like winning the Eurovision song contest and beating the English at soccer and U2 being on the cover of Time allowed us to expand our chests. Ireland began to accept its identity, to learn about itself, to discover itself."
A coherent arts policy also emerged under Prime Minister Charles Haughey between 1987 and 1992. Irish and foreign creators were already enjoying tax-free status here and an Arts Council had been in place since 1973. But Mr. Haughey created the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the National Museum, encouraged private investment in movies through tax breaks, multiplied the Arts Council's budget and founded an elite artist's academy called Aosdana (the wise people in Gaelic), its 150 members each receiving a $10,000 annual stipend.
The arts world and its hangers-on were even given their own Left Bank when Dublin's rundown Temple Bar district was renovated. Today it is crowded with studios, art galleries, movie production offices, restaurants and pubs galore. The artists of the 90's are being pampered like princes by a succession of governments that see the arts boom as proof of their own success.
 
Fame Came First Abroad
The boom was not entirely home-grown. In popular music, Ireland already had international stars in U2, Van Morrison, Sinead O'Connor and Elvis Costello. Also, several performers whose names have come to symbolize this boom were first recognized abroad. Perhaps this is inevitable. In a small country like Ireland, only success in London or New York can turn an artist into a celebrity. But the likes of, say, U2 and Mr. Barry also helped convince younger creators that they too could make it without leaving Ireland. In fact, it is now foreign publishers, theater and movie producers and curators who travel to Dublin, Cork and Galway in search of new talent.
"Irish culture is operating as a matter of course internationally," said Garry Hynes, the founder and director of the Druid Theater in Galway. "A play by the Druid in London 10 years ago was very unusual. Now you wonder if there is any theater production that will not move out of Ireland."
The Irish had, of course, never lost their love of language, yet for decades Irish writing was kept alive outside the Republic, notably in Northern Ireland, the birthplace of the 1995 Nobel laureate in literature, Seamus Heaney, the poet and novelist Seamus Deane, and the playwrights Brian Friel and Frank McGuinness. Then, in the late 1980's, a new generation of writers appeared -- this time in the Republic of Ireland itself. Their emergence marked the start of the boom.
Roddy Doyle, still only 39, was the first to be noticed with his Barrytown Trilogy, "The Commitments," "The Snapper" and "The Van," hilarious novels about working-class life that broke with Irish literary tradition in both subject and language. Yet it was only when "Paddy Clarke, Ha, Ha, Ha" won him the Booker Prize in 1993 that he was embraced by Dublin's literary elite. His success drew attention to other Irish novelists, like Pat McCabe ("The Butcher Boy"), Dermot Bolger ("The Journey Home") and Mr. Toibin ("The Story of the Night"). Yet to name some writers is to leave out many others who have already found audiences abroad.
They may not represent a literary movement, but as a pool of new talent, they are hard to match. Many seem equally happy writing novels, plays or movie scripts. And their novels and plays are routinely turned into movies, among them the Barrytown Trilogy. Today, just being an Irish writer almost suffices as a calling card.
 
A Clutch of New Playwrights
As in fiction, the new playwrights were not immediately recognized here. In the late 1980's, Billy Roche, 47, revealed a special talent for dialogue in his Wexford Trilogy, but the three plays about life's ups-and-downs in his hometown were first presented at the small Bush Theater in London. Similarly, Mr. Barry, who began his career at a poet and novelist, only won international acclaim when "The Steward of Christendom," with a memorable performance by Donal McCann as a retired Protestant police chief in Dublin, was presented at the Royal Court Theater in London (and later at the Brooklyn Academy of Music).
Among younger playwrights, Conor McPherson, 27, also first made his mark in London when he took his own production of his play "This Lime Tree Bower" to the Bush in 1996. The Bush commissioned his next play, "St. Nicholas," a monologue by a disillusioned theater critic. (The play, with Brian Cox in the sole role, will be presented by Primary Stages in New York starting in March. )
Mr. McPherson's latest play, "The Weir," in which four men and a woman recount ghost stories in a village pub, was put on by the Royal Court last summer. It earned Mr. McPherson this year's prestigious London Evening Standard Award for most promising playwright. His next play may also premiere in London.
In contrast, Marina Carr, 32, was able to present "The Mai" and "Portia Coughlan," two plays about Irish women, in the small Peacock Theater at the Abbey before both traveled to London. It seems Dublin theaters are now waking up to the new writing.
"In the early 1980's, the prediction was the playwright was dead -- that visual and physical theater was in," Patrick Mason, the Abbey's director, said. "Now there are more young playwrights than ever before."
Their subjects are varied, yet the dialogue, humor and situations are invariably Irish. Some new plays, like Alex Johnston's "Melonfarmer," about wild Dublin 20-somethings and Enda Walsh's "Disco Pigs," about manic teen-age twins, present a fairly bleak image of contemporary Ireland. Yet even when plays are set in the past, as with Mr. Barry's "Steward of Christendom" and two other plays inspired by his ancestors, they are not necessarily about the past.
"My characters were no more than whispers of my childhood, so they are largely invented," Mr. Barry said. "The plays are after-life, made-up worlds. I constructed them with material from my own life, creating my own notion of family and nationality. It became my own idea of Ireland."
Martin McDonagh, 27, the latest sensation of Irish writing, was born and lives in London, but his parents -- and his inspiration -- are Irish. His Leenane Trilogy, about repressed and dysfunctional rural life in western Ireland, was first presented at Ms. Hynes's Druid Theater in Galway last spring and traveled around Ireland before it was acclaimed in London. The Druid production of "The Beauty Queen of Leenane," the first play in the trilogy, will be presented by the Atlantic Theater Company in New York in February. Another McDonagh play, "The Cripple of Inishmaan," part of a second trilogy, had its premiere at the Royal National Theater in London and will be at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in New York in March.
 
Starting Fresh in Film
With no tradition of its own to tap, Irish filmmaking has its roots in Irish writing: of the country's two best-known directors, Neil Jordan was first a novelist and Jim Sheridan began his career as a playwright. Turning to movies in the late 1980's, each now has several successful films to his name. (Mr. Sheridan's latest movie, "The Boxer," starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Emily Watson, opens in the United States later this month; Mr. Jordan's next movie, "The Butcher Boy," adapted from Mr. McCabe's remarkable novel about a child who commits a murder and starring Stephen Rea, Aisling O'Sullivan, Sinead O'Connor and Fiona Shaw, is due in February.
The impact of Mr. Jordan and Mr. Sheridan has been enormous, not least because they have tackled touchy subjects: Mr. Jordan dealt with the Irish Republican Army in "The Crying Game" and Ireland's internecine fight for independence in "Michael Collins"; and Mr. Sheridan's "In the Name of the Father" looked at the unjust imprisonment of a young Belfast man for an I.R.A. bombing in England. These directors, along with Thaddeus O'Sullivan ("December Bride") and Pat O'Connor ("Inventing the Abbotts"), have in turn inspired a new generation of young directors.
Paddy Breathnach, 33, is among them. And he is maintaining links to Irish literature by recruiting the country's new authors to write his screenplays. His first feature film, "Ailsa," was written by the novelist and playwright Joseph O'Connor, while his newly released Irish gangland comedy, "I Went Down," was written by Mr. McPherson. Both writers are working on new screenplays for Mr. Breathnach, while Mr. McPherson is adapting "This Lime Tree Bower" for the screen.
Crucial to the embryonic movie industry are generous government tax breaks to encourage private capital to invest in movies and foreign producers to use Irish locations (as with "Braveheart"). Irish movie directors can turn to the Irish Film Board for seed money for new productions. As a result, at any one time, at least a dozen Irish films are in production.
Ireland's painters and sculptors have had to fight harder to be noticed. The commonplace is that Ireland is not a "visual" country and there are good historical reasons for this.
"Visual culture was linked to the Catholic Church, which the English saw as a supporter of Irish nationalism," explained Declan McGonagle, the director of the new Irish Museum of Modern Art, "so the English destroyed the visual context. From the 17th century, culture had to be carried in people's heads as stories and music. The jump from the oral tradition to fiction was easy, so a literary tradition eclipsed a visual tradition."
Even after independence, the only option for aspiring Irish artists was to move to London to study and work. Irish painting, in effect, belonged to the English school. "I left Ireland at 18 because I didn't think art existed here," recalled Dorothy Cross, 41, a sculptor and installation artist who has worked with unusual material like cows' udders and snakes. "And when I returned nine years later, it was still very, very difficult to live off art. Even now, people are a little uneasy with visual language."
Yet, once again, much has changed in the last 10 years, thanks to economic growth and a new infrastructure of museums, galleries, art schools and studios. Today, artists can stay home and survive.
"New hotels, restaurants and office buildings are buying art, not just one work, but whole series," explained Brian Kennedy, a printmaker. "Ordinary people also have money and have the confidence to buy contemporary Irish art."
While some successful artists like Maude Cotter, a sculptor, and Alice Maher, a painter, have settled in Ireland, several of the best-known Irish artists are still living in Britain, like the well-established Sean Scully and, from the younger generation, Kathy Prendergast. What has changed is that all now exhibit their work in Ireland. And a show, say, in the Kerlin or Green on Red galleries in Dublin, or the Crawford Municipal Art Gallery in Cork often leads to exhibitions abroad.
Still, it is harder to define most Irish art as Irish. Much painting, printmaking and sculpture are abstract. But for Mr. McGonagle, the new work does have "an Irish accent." From Willy Doherty's video art to Ms. Cross's conceptual art, he said, Irish artists can be seen "renegotiating" their relationship with Irish symbols, like women, farming, the seasons and the land.
"A lot of what is being done deals with identity and a search for different kinds of identity," Ms. Maher said. "We're looking for an identity outside the martyred image of Catholic Ireland."
 
Finding a New Artistic Profile
Yet the business of creating a new identity remains complex. If the Celtic language is enjoying new popularity in western Ireland, for example, most Irish still associate Gaelic with the repressive nationalistic Ireland they want to forget.
How Ireland is presented abroad can also be tricky. Not everyone in Limerick was happy with the way it was portrayed in Frank McCourt's best-selling memoir, "Angela's Ashes." And mention of the crowd-pulling Irish song-and-dance show, Riverdance, prompted Peter Murray, the director of the Crawford gallery in Cork, to sniff at "'all those black-clad young people goose-stepping around the stage."
In music, while the fiddle and the jig are still popular, the Corrs, the Cranberries and the mystical New Age singer Enya have perhaps come closer to blending old and new by presenting the traditional sounds of Ireland in modern arrangements.
Still, wherever the current boom may be leading the arts, Ireland's performers and creators are enjoying themselves as never before. There is hype galore about Celtic chic and only a killjoy would caution that the party could end in a terrible hangover if a recession arrived. For now, Irish artists seem hypnotized by the spectacle of an ancient land suddenly infused with youthful energy. And what a topic for conversation.
"I was much happier when this was a backwater," Mr. Toibin, the novelist, said with a laugh, "because you could shuffle around without noticing it. Now you have to interpret everything that's going on to everyone you know. It's so much more exhausting."

HEADLINE: Q&A/Nancy Hadley;
The Orchestration of 21 Communities

BYLINE: By MELINDA TUHUS 

 BODY:
NANCY HADLEY is the executive director of the Community Foundation for Greater New Haven. With assets of $180 million, it distributes about $5 million a year in grants and other assistance to support education, community and economic development, health, the arts, food and shelter and the environment in the New Haven region. The group ranks first in the nation among community foundations in investment performance in the trust category.
Ms. Hadley previously was the Connecticut director of the Local Initiatives Support Coalition, a national financing organization that helps community development corporations rebuild neighborhoods. Before that she worked in the state's Department of Transportation and Department of Motor Vehicles. 
 In a recent interview in her office at the Community Foundation building on Audubon Street in New Haven, she discussed her work and her plans. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. How have your previous positions prepared you for your current job?
A. I have worked for three governors and three mayors -- in transportation, housing, health, community development -- so I got to look at the issues of Connecticut and the Northeast from many areas, and the Community Foundation really deals with all those areas.
This job was a perfect way to take what I had learned in government -- both good and bad -- and apply it in the philanthropic world.
Q. What's an example of something good that you learned, and something bad ?
A. Over 15 years I gave out about $1 billion in public money for physical projects. If I go back 15 years later and see the project thriving, that means it was a good investment. Where projects were not community-based, I can't find the investment; it's gone. You can apply that to philanthropy: where can we apply resources, and what are the conditions for success?
Q. Many philanthropic institutions have been connected in the public mind with a sense of noblesse oblige, of well-meaning, well-off people bringing their resources to bear on problems that they don't personally experience and understand. Do you think that's true in general and for the Community Foundation as well?
A. I don't know about other foundations but I know about this board. The members made it very clear to me that they wanted the foundation connected with the entire community, across geographic, age and economic boundaries. The directors finished a strategic plan a year before I came that talks about a focused effort on collaboration, that builds on the skills of individuals to take charge of their lives, that says you are going to reach a whole gamut of people. The board hired me to make a partnership between the foundation and business, government and nonprofits. I saw that as a real exciting opportunity.
Q. A few years ago the foundation changed its name from the New Haven Foundation to the Community Foundation for Greater New Haven. What does this shift to a regional focus mean in practice?
A. We serve 21 towns, from Milford to Meriden to Madison, plus the lower Naugatuck Valley. The name change just clarifies what the foundation has been doing all along.
The foundation was founded 70 years ago with four purposes which hold true today: to increase philanthropy, to invest dollars in a way that provides a high return, to distribute the interest from the donations in the most strategic way so that this region can compete in the global economy, and to provide community leadership. We are a regional institution. To some extent we can be helpful in bridging some of the issues that prevent all individuals from competing in a global economy, by convening groups, brokering, putting some issues on the table that people need some focus around.
Q. You are a big supporter of "asset-based strategies," an approach on which Prof. John McKnight of Northwestern University wrote the book. How does this approach differ from the traditional way of looking at communities in need?
A. John McKnight was invited to New Haven by the foundation in the mid-1980's, after which the foundation launched its Neighborhood Program, which includes neighborhood beautification and building efforts -- things like community gardens or assisting block watches. It's a simple application process that spawns leadership in the neighborhoods.
Q. What exactly is an "asset-based strategy?"
A. It looks at the glass as half-full, not half-empty. It says, "God gave each of us strengths and skills. How do we nurture those?" It's looking at what's good about people. I spent years getting government money based on needs and deficiencies; if you focus on what's wrong, you miss the opportunity to see what's right. If you look on the positive side you look at things in a whole different way.
I've been here 10 months. I'm putting a team in place that will strengthen our ability to implement this new model, looking at how to build on the positives. It's not going to happen overnight; it will take many years to accomplish.
Q. The foundation was instrumental in bringing together something called the Arts Coalition. What's the goal there?
A. We are trying to build new networks across special interests, geographic lines and institutional territories. The arts community undertook a more comprehensive assessment of itself as an economic, cultural and educational force. The Arts Council of Greater New Haven, foundations, arts institutions, the business community and the city pooled resources to do what will be a blueprint for the role of the arts in community development, as well as for the future of arts groups themselves.
Q. Your annual report is full of funds: unrestricted, preference, donor advised, designated or field of interest funds. It sometimes seems that would create tremendous confusion among potential donors. What do they all mean?
A. The different kinds of funds give donors flexibility in what they want to do: fund an area of interest, such as kids or arts or health, or give to a specific geographic area, or in trust to the board of the Community Foundation to deal with problems in the future. For example, 50 years ago the issue was polio; now it's AIDS. Who knows what it will be in another 50 years?
Not everyone has $10,000 to start a fund. You maybe have only $1,000 or $500 but you want to do something that will have an impact. For example, the Women and Girls' Fund is donor-advised. Women came together and said, "We will pledge $1,000 over five years." That's doable.
Q. The foundation partnered with the City of New Haven and won a $4.5 million Federal grant to improve health for pregnant women and infants. Is this the kind of collaboration you were hired to do?
A. Yes. It includes a community-based approach. This program has been going for about 5 years in 20 cities. It's been found that in communities that have more involvement the outcomes are better. Our application was a collaboration between the city, the foundation, the Consortium for Substance Abusing Women and Their Children and the Special Commission on Infant Health, which was initially funded by the Community Foundation 10 years ago to address the issue of high infant mortality in New Haven.
We are going to mentor with some of the cities in the first round, to learn from them their best practices and apply them to New Haven.
Q. Do you have any examples of successful practices from other cities?
A. In a city in New Hampshire doctors and other medical people asked the community how to accomplish the goal of reducing teen-age pregnancy. The intervention the community came up with was to get the kids jobs. The adolescent pregnancy rate went down from 22 percent to 6 percent in one year. If they had left it to the medical establishment only, it would have come up with medical interventions.
Q. What are the goals of the grant?
A. To reduce adolescent pregnancy, and to improve health care for women and babies from pregnancy through the first year of life. There are about 2,000 births a year in the city, and about 500 of them are high-risk.
Q. You mentioned a "funder collaborative." What's that?
A. I think it's one of the most important aspects of my job. The foundation must work collaboratively with other funders to ensure outcomes and benchmarks. Our area includes Federal and state government, 21 municipal governments, five United Ways and several private foundations.
Two months after I got here, the foundation board approved our membership in the Coordinating Council of Foundations, a regional association of grantmakers that gets around the table to make sure all the resources are used as effectively as possible. We are forming a New Haven Advisory Committee to the Council.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
As Retailers Expand, New Shopping Centers Rise

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
WITH a healthy retail climate and a roster of national retail chains expanding in or entering New Jersey developers are scrambling to put up new shopping centers to accommodate such tenants as anchors.
Two are power centers -- defined by the International Council of Shopping Centers in Manhattan as open-air centers with 300,000 square feet or more and three or more "big box" specialty outlets. These and four other shopping centers either completed, under way or planned count among their tenants national discounters like Wal-Mart and Target; home-improvement chains such as Home Depot and Lowe's, and Kohl's department store, the latter two new entries in the state. 
 Five of the shopping centers are new, and a sixth is expanding. Collectively, they total 2 million square feet.
The tenants, which are on aggressive campaigns to increase their market share, find the state attractive because of its dense population, large number of high-income residents and heavily traveled highways, retail analysts say. Movie theaters and supermarket chains are also on a growth spree, as are regional retailers such as Bob's Sporting Goods.
"The state's retail market has not been this good in 10 to 12 years and it has been particularly good for developers, who can choose from among a number of tenants," said Ted Kraus, who heads his own retail consulting firm in Mercerville. Rents have risen 10 to 15 percent over the last year while the number of empty stores has decreased, Mr. Kraus said, noting that the statewide shopping center vacancy rate, excluding major cities, was under 3 percent, down from 5 percent the same time last year.
And with national retailers on board as tenants in these centers financing is easier to obtain, added Gene P. Spiegelman, associate managing director at the retail group of Insignia/ESG, the Manhattan brokerage.
What is not easy, he said, and other analysts agreed, is finding suitably zoned sites. That, along with environmental constraints, long approval processes and, in some cases, community resistance will temper the pace of new construction.
While Christmas sales are up 2 to 3 percent over last year's, Mr. Kraus said last week, retailers had anticipated as much as a 5 percent increase. Nevertheless, he added, they expand to remain competitive.
Wal-Mart's expansion and the arrival of Target and Kohl's in the state last March, Mr. Kraus said, are expected to "severely hurt" both Caldor and Bradlees, both of which are undergoing reorganization following Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings in 1995.
So is a glut of space inevitable? "That's always part of the real estate cycle," Mr. Kraus warned. "But for the next six months the retail market, short of a war, should remain on a healthy track."
To feed the prevailing optimism, the developer National Realty & Development Corporation of Purchase, N.Y., has recently completed two projects and has two more in various stages of development in the western and central portions of the state. Each has a Wal-Mart store as an anchor. Other anchors include a supermarket and a movie theater.
The projects -- each costing $20 million to $25 million to develop -- are being financed by conventional bank loans and the company's own equity. Rents for the smaller stores range from $16 to $19 a square foot; the bigger ones are less, and most of the space in all of the centers has been preleased, said Richard A. Baker, National Realty's president.
"We feel the community shopping center is a strong retail concept, for which there will be a long-term need," Mr. Baker said. "No matter what happens in the world people will always get in their cars and go to a supermarket to buy a quart of milk or to a discount store to walk down the aisles."
He said his company also believed that New Jersey's economy had come back "faster and stronger than other parts of the Northeast" and that there were areas within the state that could absorb more stores. One, he said, is the growing Interstate 78 corridor through the western one-fourth of the state, where the company's four projects are situated.
Last October National Realty completed a 332,695-square-foot center on 50 acres along Route 22, just off I-78 in Pohatcong in Warren County. It was designed to serve the greater Phillipsburg area, where commercial growth had been long hampered until the sewer plant in the area was expanded two years ago, said Mr. Baker.
CALLED Pohatcong Plaza, the shopping center is anchored by a 128,212-square-foot Wal-Mart. It will be joined by a 59,111-square-foot Giant Supermarket and a 43,500-square-foot, 12-screen Regal Cinema complex, which are scheduled to open next spring.
In Franklin Township in Hunterdon County, the company completed the renovation of an existing 227,000-square-foot center on 30 acres on Pittstown Road (Route 513), not far from Exit 15 of I-78. A key part of the improvements to the center, which was half vacant when National Realty purchased it in 1996, involved replacing a large amount of vacant space with a 116,000-square-foot Wal-Mart. That store opened last April and anchors the center, now called Wal-Mart Plaza, along with a 60,000-square-foot renovated Laneco supermarket.
Future plans include expanding the Wal-Mart store by 7,000 square feet and developing a 32,000-square-foot, 10-screen movie theater on the site.
Mr. Baker said his company also expected to break ground in the spring on a 268,000-square-foot center in Manville in Somerset County and had state and local approvals for the fourth project, a 286,000-foot center in Mansfield in Warren County.
"We will continue to look for sites in communities where we see a need, and if we can't find that we won't build," Mr. Baker said.
Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., also has three more stores in various stages of development elsewhere in New Jersey. If all the new stores are realized they would bring to 21 the number of stores the discounter has opened since it entered the state in 1991 as part of its eastward expansion, said Keith T. Morris, a spokesman. "And we have not completed our expansion here," Mr. Morris said, adding that the company would open more stores in keeping with market demand.
In Piscataway, at Shelton Road and South Washington Avenue, a 421,000-square-foot power center is under construction. It will include as anchors a 134,843-square-foot Wal-Mart as well as the first Lowe's home-improvement store in the state, with 144,700 square feet of space including a garden shop. The company, based in North Wilkesboro, N.C., started its expansion into the New York metropolitan area last year.
Garden Homes Commercial, a division of Garden Homes, both based in Short Hills, is developing the project, convinced that the big-box retailers collected in such centers offer the price and convenience consumers want. It will take 18 months to complete.
The concept also made sense for Hillview Center on Route 38 in Cherry Hill, a 340,000-square-foot power center that opened last October. The developer of the $50 million project is Preit-Rubin of Philadelphia, the development and management arm of the Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust.
Eric M. Mallory, vice president of development at Preit-Rubin, noted that 1.7 million people with an average household income of $42,500 lived within a three-mile radius of the site, that Hillview Center was across Route 38 from the 1.2 million-square-foot Cherry Hill Mall, which already attracts those consumers, and that 45,000 cars pass the site each day.
Kohl's department store is making its first foray into the state with an 86,770-square foot store at Hillview Center. Another anchor is Target, which opened a 130,915-square-foot store.
Target, based in Minneapolis, entered the state as part of its expansion into the Mid-Atlantic region. "New Jersey has great demographics and consumers here fit our customer profile -- young middle-income families who are well educated," said Carolyn A. Brookter, a spokeswoman for Target, discussing the reasons her company had moved into the state. Target is considered a competitor to Wal-Mart
Ms. Brookter said that three Target stores, including the one at the Hillview Center, had opened this year and that three or four more would open next year.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Painting With Wood and Ink, as a Master Did It

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
THE Museum of the American Hungarian Foundation here devotes itself to the work of artists who were born in Hungary but lived and worked elsewhere. The artist currently featured, Joseph Domjan, a virtuoso in the medium of the color woodcut, ideally fits this requirement.
Born in 1907 in Kispest, near Budapest, he made his first woodcut in Sweden in 1947. His art has many affinities with Asian art, links that were strengthened in 1955 when he made a yearlong visit to China. When Hungary's failed uprising against Soviet domination anti-Communist revolution came in 1956, he was exhibiting his work in Switzerland, and from there he emigrated to the United States. Domjan (pronounced DOE-mi-yan) lived and maintained a studio first in River Edge, Bergen County, and then in Tuxedo Park, N.Y., where he died in 1992. 
 His contributions to the art of woodcut are highly original. Woodcuts printed with many colors are central to Asian art but unusual in the West. Domjan, who began his career as a painter, treated the color woodcut like a painting. His carved blocks were covered with thick oil paint instead of the usual printer's ink, and the image was built up in many layered applications of rich, often contrasting colors. The final result often resembles a textured painting more than a print. Most of the prints are shown in frames without glass fronts, so that the painterly surfaces may be appreciated.
Zsuzsanna Szabolcsi, the librarian at the Montclair Art Museum, and Patricia L. Fazekas, curator of the Foundation's museum, organized this retrospective in terms of subject and theme, rather than chronologically. It opens with several pastel portraits and early woodcuts that conform to Stalinist-era conventions. "Pouring Molten Iron/Open Hearth Furnace" is not as dreary as it sounds, for the hot metal is a gleaming yellow that jumps out of the mostly black composition.
Domjan seems to have been at his most inventive and splendid when he was creating animals, as in the sinuous composition titled "Fish Deer," from the early 1970's, which makes the most of the similar curves of a deer's antler, and a fish's tail. His greatest enthusiasm was birds, and peacocks were the perfect vehicles for his love of excess. But there was more: compositions titled "Eternal Peacock" and "Everlasting Peacock" were for him symbols of the ultimate triumph of the human spirit over adversity and also embodied a merging of imagination and reason.
A hallmark of Domjan's style is lacy patterning inside the major contours of an image. Such intricate decorative patterning is a staple of Hungarian folk arts, but Domjan uses it with abandon. In "Fish Deer," for example, the attentive viewer will discover many spectral fish swimming through the bodies of the two central animals. Domjan maintained that this obvious borrowing from folk art allied him with the composer Bela Bartok, who incorporated Hungarian folk tunes into his otherwise very modern works.
Domjan's major style translated easily and well into other media. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan used to sell brass Christmas ornaments designed by Domjan in its gift shop, and major tapestry makers understood that the multiple layers composing a Domjan woodcut are analogous to the various colored threads in a rich weaving. His composition "The Big Poppy" was woven at the Royal Tapestry Workshops in Madrid, and "Peacock of Carnations" in Aubusson, France.
When he depicted human figures, it was similarly in a very stylized way. Typically, a person is but a small head and tiny feet at either end of an enormous, curving bell-like shape full of patterning. A viewer realizes how the patterning ennobles and makes charming everyone portrayed. For example, "Red Shepherd" looks like an aristocrat, with a flower-decorated cape and flamboyant feathers emerging from the band of his tall hat. It may take a while to find the two personages of "Mother and Child"; the attention of most viewers will be on the rather angular, even harsh patterning that contrasts with the rounded contours of the woman's dress and veil.
In addition to the technique he developed, Domjan also printed the standard way, with printer's ink, and the curators have assembled a few examples of the same composition made by each process. The contrast is astounding; the viewer's eye notices very different details.
B OTANICAL subjects, from flowers to herbs, were a subject to which Domjan turned consistently during his career, though understandably they lack the ingenious qualities of the animals and the figures. One wall of the gallery is devoted to 22 black-and-white images that illustrate "Toldi," a dramatic ballad written in 1847 by Janos Aranyi. The arrangement is rather like an animator's story board. There's obviously much action, and the display is almost dizzying in its rhythm, as well as in the sharp differentiation between dark and light components. Regrettably, the text of the ballad is not furnished.
It is always satisfying to be given a glimpse of an artist's tools, and several of Domjan's rather large blocks of hard, resistant fruit wood are included; for the sake of economy, he carved on both sides. In a multiple-block woodcut, the key-block is the one containing the outline of the composition and is printed last. Ms. Fazekas reports that Domjan drew the shapes on the key-blocks, but it was his wife, Evelyn, sometimes called his collaborator, who cut them.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Dr. Howard M. Newburger;
On the Front Line of Fighting Child Abuse

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
AS a sergeant in World War II, Howard M. Newburger was so inspired by the sense of dignity of concentration camp survivors that he became a psychologist. Today, in his practice, Dr. Newburger seeks to help victims of a different kind of brutality -- child abuse.
The statistics he cites on child abuse are staggering: 3 million children a year across the United States are victims of abuse or neglect, with 1,000 children dying as a result. Dr. Newburger says the blame for the increase in abuse can be placed in part on the dislocation that civilization is going through -- the "Third Wave," which the futurist Alvin Toffler, also the author of "Future Shock," wrote about decades ago. 
 On Feb. 14 in Manhattan, Dr. Newburger, a resident of Harrison, will discuss techniques for treating abused children and sensitizing professionals to the issues at the yearly meeting of the New York Chapter of the American Society of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama.
Dr. Newburger, who is trained in psychoanalysis, was formerly chief psychologist for the Annandale prison in New Jersey, an adviser to the United Nations and chairman of the psychology department at New York University before entering private practice in Harrison. He also helped found the Institutes of Applied Human Dynamics for the Severely and Multiply Developmentally Disabled (St. Jude's) in Tarrytown and Pleasantville.
Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Dr. Newburger:
Q. What caught your interest in specializing in child abuse issues?
A. Two things. The first was when I was a psychoanalyst at the United Nations in 1952. One of the problems we had was in northern Burma where there was an enormous increase in child abuse, marital breakdowns, alcoholism, drug addiction. It was embarrassing because millions and millions of dollars were being pumped into northern Burma to permit them to have a developed infrastructure, schools, health, hospitals, housing, and with all this largesse, look at these terrible statistics. It was awful.
So my problem was to help find out why. And the why was that the people were Buddhists, but unlike the Chinese Buddha, who was a fat Buddha, their Buddha was a slender Buddha who didn't need anything more. With all the largesse, they were not prepared. It went against the then existing value system. Whenever there is internal conflict of that sort, we can expect manifestation of disease -- violence , brutality, alcoholism, all those things. We solved the problem: we stopped giving money to northern Burma and the abuse stopped.
I was also influenced because I had been chief psychologist in a state prison, and it seemed to me that most of the people who were involved in violent offenses -- murder and otherwise -- had been physically abused as they were growing up. There seemed to be a linkage.
Q. Tell about what you saw during World War II and how that influenced you.
A. I have some knowledge of German, and I had 72 combat points at the end of World War II, which meant I was eligible to be shipped back early to go home. And then we were going to have a 10- or 15-day furlough, then we'd be trained for the invasion of Japan. However, I came down with sandfly fever, so I missed going back on the boat. I got through that and then instead of going back home they shipped me to Germany. There was a camp there, and I became somewhat involved with the people at the camp. What impressed me enormously was that despite the unspeakable treatment that they had experienced, they still maintained a sense of dignity and self-respect and a sense of humor. I was astounded. I was so impressed with what I saw, the strength of these people, that I wanted to find out more about it. And that's why I went into psychoanalysis.
Q. In recent years, there has been an increase in the attention given to child abuse, but apparently there is an increase in child abuse cases as well. Is there more abuse, or are there just more reported cases?
A. I think it's both. I think that since the Holocaust and since the atomic bomb in Japan people have become more sensitized to humanity and they are more sensitized to abuse and there are more reports. The other thing is this: we're in the third industrial revolution now. And this is enormous. The first industrial revolution was the invention of the wooden hoe in the Mesopotamian crescent. That marked life enormously. It meant people could become food growers and meant there was a surplus and we could then have music, art, literature and we could start to record our history.
This continued until the time that chemical fire was rediscovered. The Greeks had had the turbine, but they used it as a toy. They didn't develop it as a source of power. This introduced the second industrial revolution. Again the complete value system shifted. People now moved to the urban centers and to factories. There was public education and some bills against child labor were proposed.
Now we're in the third industrial revolution.
Q. This is what Alvin Toffler wrote about, correct?
A. Yes. Most of the jobs of today did not exist 30 years ago. We have a situation where the skilled of yesterday become the semiskilled of today, and the semiskilled of yesterday become the unskilled of today.
And with the shift in the moral values that are now associated with these early stages of the third industrial revolution, there is also confusion about what works. These things -- moral values and ethics -- are codes of behavior based upon a person's physical perception of the world about him. This world is changing and there is an enormous shift in the value system.
Some of the manifestations are loss of control, more crazies going out and doing bad things. In spite of the wealth of information that's available about contraception, out of wedlock births are way up. They talk about crime being down -- well not universally. These are symptoms of a society in change. And child abuse is also a symptom.
Q. What does that mean for you as a psychologist?
A. There are certain consequences of that abuse, and I see it in all economic, cultural and educational groups. I'm thinking about my patient load. These are some of the most prominent families in Greenwich and upper and central Westchester. The abuse makes itself felt with a sense of betrayal, distrust and a sense of shame. Now shame is very important because it's cumulative. We used to think it was like playing pool, where the ball ricochets from side to side, and so on. The feeling now is it doesn't ricochet, it becomes cumulative. You know The Saturday Evening Post had this famous cover where the guy is yelled at by his boss and comes home and yells at his wife, who yells at the kids, who kick the dog. That's the old theory.
The current thinking is that shame builds on shame and will become anger and anger can build on anger and become rage, and this is why we have people without obvious histories suddenly participating in very violent acts. My goodness, where did this come from? It came from the cumulation over time.
There are ways to break the cycle and help these people function at a higher level and become more loving and productive. You can relearn the lessons you were taught. Attitudes are not engraved in stone.

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
Shake Hands With a Corporate Recruiter

BYLINE: By CARRIE BUDOFF 

DATELINE: PISCATAWAY

 BODY:
ANY senior at Rutgers University who aspires to work for Hewlett-Packard must first win the approval of Jack Greene, a 54-year-old recruiter for the Fortune 500 computer company.
Without Mr. Greene's nod, a bright-eyed, energetic college student will not get past Phase One: the resume review. If he likes what he sees, the prospective candidate is invited for an on-campus interview. 
 That's when Mr. Greene, in a deep, commanding voice, drills the students about school and work experience. As the students answer questions, he pays attention to their body language and makes quick judgments about their personalities. He likes students who give firm handshakes and look him directly in the eye.
Usually, he takes no more than 30 minutes to determine whether they will fit into his company.
"I'm the first filter," said Mr. Greene. "Recruiting is a filtration process."
To college seniors looking for jobs in corporate America, campus recruiters like Mr. Greene can open doors or slam them shut. As the campus manager who oversees recruiting at Rutgers, he is authorized to slash the candidate pool of more than 300 to about eight dozen. Then, after the best candidates have five interviews with other high-level managers at the company, Mr. Greene and other recruiters help decide who is most qualified to fill 20 openings annually in jobs including sales, consulting and product development.
Job prospects have significantly improved for college seniors graduating in the coming year who can point to good grades and past job experience -- particularly in computer programming, sales and investment banking.
"In the early 1990's, when the job market was truly in a downturn, we were struggling to get 100 employers at our career fair," said Richard L. White, director of career services at Rutgers. More than 250 companies have signed up for the New Jersey Collegiate Career Day on Jan. 7.
"We had to close the door," he said. "It's a very clear, measurable indication that employers are really knocking on the door again."
And companies are getting impatient. They are not waiting until the spring, as they have traditionally done, to kick off their recruitment process, said Minerva H. Reed, director of career services at Princeton University. Recruiters could be found on campus every night last fall, making presentations about their companies or giving receptions for potential employees.
"We are seeing organizations clamoring for students' attention earlier in the year," she said. "The competition is keen. There is an active campaign for students."
At Princeton and Rutgers, the fall term used to be dominated by the science and engineering firms, while the liberal arts majors began interviewing in the spring. That changed last year.
"Now there's almost a complete overlap," said Ms. Reed. "The major organizations, such as financial service concerns, want to visit in the fall and the spring. It's a competitive sector. They want to get their offers out early and get their hiring done earlier."
Many students who were interviewed in October or November received offers and were asked to accept or decline by Thanksgiving vacation -- "exploding offers," Ms. Reed calls them.
"Students are in a quandary," she said.
There are more than 126,000 employees at Hewlett-Packard, and Mr. Greene, who has worked there 25 years, has helped hire 50 to 60 of them since 1983, when he became being the company's recruiting manager at Rutgers. (Mr. Greene, whose official job is national marketing manager, has counterparts throughout Hewlett-Packard who recruit at 63 other schools across the country.)
He estimates that he spends about 25 percent of his time perusing the hundreds of resumes that pour into his electronic mail account, interviewing students, going to career fairs and talking before special interest clubs at Rutgers.
After 14 years on the recruitment circuit, he has become a master of his craft. It takes him no more than 12 seconds to look over a resume. (He prefers a standard resume, but when he has received a nonstandard one -- like one that was printed on pink paper with a color photo of the student, "I tried to look beyond it," he said.)
He zeros in on job experience, campus leadership, projects, grades and hometown. Because Hewlett-Packard has facilities in 30 cities across the United States, knowing where a student comes from "indicates that I probably have a better chance of getting them out of New Jersey," said Mr. Greene, who graduated from Rutgers's College of Engineering in 1966.
About eight dozen students are chosen to interview on campus at the career center, with Mr. Greene and other recruiters, usually young Rutgers alumni, whom he brings with him. Each wears a denim shirt with the Hewlett-Packard and Rutgers logos sewn above the top left pocket.
"We take over the place," said Mr. Greene.
This year he took 14 other recruiters, the most he has ever taken to campus with him. From 1989 to 1992, during the recession, when Hewlett-Packard hired fewer than five people each year, Mr. Greene went alone on these interviewing trips.
As the interviewees arrive, they are ushered into a conference room, where they watch videos on the company and talk with recent Rutgers graduates who work there.
After that, they each move into one of eight interviewing rooms, tiny, sterile boxes that would not be out of place at a hospital.
The student has 30 minutes to sell himself to Mr. Greene, who must also sell the company to the student. Given the time constraints, the little things matter.
So what are the do's of a first interview?
Give a strong handshake. Always be positive and energetic. Stick to the questions that are asked. And maintain good posture.
The no-no's?
Asking about salaries or benefits. Knowing nothing about the company. Being evasive and unpleasant, or downright hostile.
Seconds after the candidate walks out the door, Mr. Greene fills out a form with comments on his Hewlett-Packard laptop computer. Is the person a must hire? A recommended hire? Or does he "lack H-P skills?"
The form is sent via computer to another manager, who will take over the five-step interviewing process. And Mr. Greene's job is over, unless someone elsewhere in the company has questions about a candidate or he believes a candidate is a "must hire." In that case, he may market the student to others in the company.
About 20 percent make it past the initial on-campus interview, but that is not necessarily because the other 80 percent performed poorly. "It's a competitive process," said Mr. Greene. "And we do not have unlimited job openings."
Bringing a new employee into a company carries a certain amount of stress. When asked about hiring mistakes he has made, Mr. Greene replied without hesitating, "I hired someone who was a murderer."
Edwin Snelgrove, who graduated from Cook College in the early 1980's, started with the company right out of school. Six months later, the police considered him a prime suspect in the murder of a 23-year-old woman who was his ex-girlfriend. They were not able to link him to the murder until four years later when he attempted to kill a 44-year-old Elmwood Park woman after the two met at a bar.
All the while, Mr. Snelgrove was working at Hewlett-Packard, selling computers and earning $40,000 a year.
"Looking back on it, there are a couple of things I should've noticed," said Mr. Greene. "He did poorly in his last semester at Rutgers. It should've put me off a little bit. But he had such a strong presence."
When Mr. Greene discusses the incident, it seems as though he feels personally responsible for the hire, even though six other employees also met with him and recommended his appointment.
"If you sat in the room with him, like I did, you would see that he was this all-American college boy -- handsome, polite, friendly," said Mr. Greene, as his mind wandered back to that day in 1983. "His G.P.A. was a 3.8. I can still remember it."
"So you can be wrong," he said. "A mistake like that puts you on your guard. It makes you realize that you are not as good as you think you are."
Mr. Greene and his recruiters are relying more on a new technique called "behavioral interviewing." Employers can probe a job candidate's past actions and behavior by asking him to respond to specific situations. For example, Mr. Greene may ask the student to describe an uncomfortable situation or to tell him about a creative project that student has done.
"It makes it difficult for a candidate to lie," said Mr. Greene.
Mr. Greene has seen the recruiting move from a system where students had to wake up early in the morning to sign up on an interview list posted outside the career services building at Rutgers to one based almost solely on the Internet. Students tap into a web site called Jobtrack, which is where employers post job opportunities. And he receives tons of resumes through his E-mail account.
Despite all the changes, and one or two hiring mistakes along the way, Mr. Greene still smiles when he thinks about why he is still recruiting at Rutgers after 14 years.
"I love the excitement of finding talent," he said.
And he has no plans for leaving that part of his job behind.
"I can't seem to get out of it," said Mr. Greene. "But I'm not in a rush to leave."
 
You Have 30 Minutes. Make Them All Count.
 Here are some interviewing tips from a guide prepared by Greg Sobol, Assistant Director of Career Services on the Douglas-Cook campus of Rutgers University.
 
PLUSES -- Most interviewers look for good communication skills, the ability to interact with others, the ability to handle stress, the ability to solve problems and promotability.
 
MINUSES -- These 10 factors can knock a candidate out of contention:
 
-- Not being prepared for the interview; no research or questions about employer.
-- Inability to express ideas clearly; poor communication skills.
-- Poorly defined career goals; little or no sense of direction.
-- No real interest in the employer.
-- Unhappy personality; disliked former jobs, supervisors, school.
-- Evasiveness; making excuses.
-- Asking too few or poor questions about the job.
-- Interested only in best dollar offer.
-- Lack of confidence or poise; fails to make eye contact, weak handshake.
-- Unwillingness to relocate.

F.Y.I. -- Be prepared for a new technique called "behavioral interviewing." This interview method focuses on the applicant's past actions and behaviors in response to specific situations. For example, the interviewer may state, "Describe a major problem you have faced on the job and how you dealt with it." To prepare for this type of question, think about situations that demonstrate your leadership, problem solving, customer service, teamwork and planning abilities. Prepare short descriptions of each situation and be ready to give specific positive outcomes that reflect well on you.
 
A FINAL TIP -- Good preparation will increase your confidence. Confidence will make you a winner. Like the actor who experiences some nervousness each evening when he goes on stage, but uses it to enhance his performance, you too should let your nervous energy work for you.

HEADLINE: CELEBRATIONS;
It's Solstice, Hanukkah, Kwaanza: Let There Be Light!

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
Today, at 3:07 P.M. Eastern standard time, the northern hemisphere is tilted as far away from the sun as it ever gets, marking the moment called the winter solstice. And many New Jerseyans -- even those still finishing their Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa shopping -- will be taking note at some point during the weekend.
Richard Clarkson, a 53-year-old delivery-service manager, plans to be in Landing this afternoon, in the middle of a field, standing in a circle with others who belong to a Morris County group called the Center for Spiritual Enfoldment. Lillian Mulligan, who has been a member of a mission church in Camden for 23 years, will be having friends over to her home in Mullica Hill this evening. She and her husband will turn out all the lights in the house, go outside and pray for the light to return. Sister Miriam MacGillis, a Dominican nun, will be leading a private observance at Genesis Farm, the ecological learning center she directs in Blairstown. Brian Wilkes, who is Chief Standing Bear in the American Cherokee Confederacy, expects to be in a fire circle on ceremonial ground, around noon, with a dozen or so other Native Americans. 
 "It will be almost like a welcoming party," he said. "Like we have an important visitor: the sun. So we say, 'Let's get everything together and light a fire so he knows where to come.' "
Early man found his first deities in the rhythms of nature: times for hunting, planting and harvesting and for giving birth. These days people tend to consult the calendar. If it's the 25th day of Kislev (which begins at sundown on Dec. 23 this year), Jews are lighting the first candle of Hanukkah. On the 25th of December, Christians are thinking about the star of Bethlehem. On the 26th, African-Americans are lighting candles for the first day of Kwanzaa.
These celebrations are at least one of the reasons that the candle business is booming. The National Candle Association, a Washington-based trade group, says total retail sales of candles nationwide are growing at an annual average rate of 25 percent, and will reach about $2 billion this year. More than a third of those sales take place at this holiday season.
What is it about the waxing and waning of light that makes it such a peg for celebrations? Part of the answer may lie in its absolute predictability. Ice ages might come and go, rainy seasons might shorten or lengthen. But, at any given latitude, the seasonal change in the length of the day is a rock-steady beat, one that life itself is dancing to in increasingly understood ways.
"From the beginning of life, which goes back three billion years, there have been these seasonal changes in light," said Dr. Thomas Wehr, a research psychiatrist at the National Institute of Mental Health. "It was one of those things that life had to cope with. And when you look across species, you find clocks that respond to daily and seasonal changes in light."
Those clocks, he said, tend to have a common pendulum: the hormone melatonin. "It appears to be very widely distributed," Dr. Wehr said. "It's in mammals, reptiles, birds, insects, algae. Morning glories." And there are other clues, like a clock gene associated with fruit flies that has recently been identified in humans. "What it's telling us," Dr. Wehr said, "is that these mechanisms are very, very old from an evolutionary perspective."
Studies on light's effects have been increasing since the 1980's, when seasonal affective disorder, or winter depression, was first identified. It is a condition that disproportionately affects women. Scientists are testing whether that disparity might be linked to another gender difference. In approximately one out of three women, compared with one out of eight men, a clock in the brain orders a cycle of melatonin production that matches the length of the day, regardless of exposure to artificial light or dark.
Clifford Geertz, a noted anthropologist now at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, has concluded that man's physical evolution was inextricably entwined with his social evolution. It is no surprise that the cycle of light and dark marked by our bodies is also marked by so many religions.
Before it was Christmas, Dec. 25 was the Birthday of the Inconquerable Son, the Natalis Solis Invicti, in honor of Mithras, a Persian deity absorbed into the Roman world in the first century B.C. The Romans were also celebrating Saturnalia at that time, the winter solstice. (The word comes from the Latin words for sun and still.) Thanks to the vagaries of the earth's orbit and terrestrial calendars, two thousand years ago the solstice usually fell on Dec. 25.
Christianity eventually absorbed many of the traditions of both, including strong nuances of light and dark symbolism -- so much so that popes repeatedly admonished the faithful to abandon rites that seemed too heathen. In the 17th century, English Puritans felt compelled to outlaw the celebration of Christmas, a ban that lasted a bitter 12 years. Even today, some Catholic holidays are transparent adaptations of pagan ones. In Montclair, old Swedish customs prompt an annual celebration of Dec. 13 as St. Lucia's Day, which is, in fact, a pre-Christian Scandinavian solstice rite with a vague Christian overlay.
Rabbi Eliezer Diamond at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan, the nerve center of Conservative Judaism, said that Hanukkah, too, most likely builds on a previous solstice celebration, though its narrative roots go to the struggle of fundamentalist Jews against the assimilationist pressures of the Greek Syrian occupiers. The narrative source of the Feast of Lights includes a miracle: a lamp in the purged temple has only enough undefiled oil for one day, but burns for eight.
Dr. Maulana Karenga, a California black studies professor, was therefore following an ancient precedent of piggybacking holidays when, in 1966, he invented the seven-day celebration of Kwanzaa for African Americans and placed it in late December. Intended as a way to dignify black life, the central ritual is, of course, lighting candles. Dr. Karenga's seven candles match seven principles he believed necessary for black Americans to survive in America with their self-esteem intact: unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and faith.
The range of interpretations of fire and light that will be invoked this season appears to be endless.
At some, as at Chief Standing Bear's gathering today, the fire is simply practical. "Fire carries smoke into the sky, and it also carries prayers into the sky," the chief said, explaining that the solstice is not counted among the major Cherokee holy days, which have more elaborate rituals. "It's an astronomical term," he said. "You need 15 experts to calculate it. But when God wants to send you a message, you'll know." The prayers, he said, will be straightforward expressions of thanksgiving and requests for guidance. "Basically," he said, "it's 'Let me know what I need to do, and let me have the strength to do it. Just point and I'll do the rest, and thanks for pointing.' "
Pausing to laugh, he added: "It's a little more eloquent in Cherokee."
Mr. Clarkson, who will be in the field in Landing in Morris County, said that being outdoors was important. "We'll find God outside, because that's God's creation," he said. "A church is man's creation. It's a very simple kind of thing."
Mrs. Mulligan's celebration this year, turning all the lights out, is far simpler than some she has enjoyed in the past. Her son, John Hasse, studied in Spokane, Wash., with an Indian leader named Sun Bear who has since died. But for a few years, he turned the Mullica Hills house and its 24 wooded acres into a religious center. Come solstice, and the sweat lodge was packed with believers who wanted to cleanse themselves in time for the new light.
Witches, or Wiccans, tend to be rather circumspect about their observances. Susan Blaustein, 43, said she would decorate the small, private altar in her New Jersey home with a branch from an old sycamore tree that she was fond of, and would surround it with objects that represented earth, air, fire and water, as well as objects that created "beauty and peace."
Practicing an earth-centered religion in an urban setting yields some peculiar twists. The druid group that will celebrate Yule in Bryan Perry's Jersey City loft is named Greenman Grove, after the faces carved into stone buildings. They have often used the nearby Statue of Liberty, with her upraised torch, as a symbol of Brigid, the Celtic goddess of fire. Today's ceremony, said Nancy Hoffman, 40, a New Brunswick resident who is a longtime member of the grove, will include inviting the spirits of significant people and places. Among them will be the spirit of her parking space.
For most of the solstice celebrants, the idea means more than the actual moment. In fact, some people said they would celebrate a tad early.
For instance, the seven members of the Red Oak Grove, a new druid group in Mount Holly, planned to start Friday evening, lighting candles at sunset, and praying, singing, feasting and extinguishing the candles one by one until all was dark at midnight.
Then they planned to light them again one by one, accompanied by more praying, singing and feasting, until dawn, when they would head back outside to greet the sun.
And then, their rituals complete, said their leader, who goes by the name Lion's Dream, "We'll go in and go to sleep!"

Chart: "As the World Turns"
The earth, which has a barely elliptical orbit, is closest to the sun (perihelion) in the depths of the northern hemisphere's winter, and the furthest from the son (aphelion) in the midst of its summer. What determines the seasons is the tilt of the earth on its axis.
 
A tilt toward the sun means summer and away means winter, which is why the southern hemisphere has summer while the northern hemisphere has winter, and vice versa. The solstices mark the most extreme moment of tilt, while the equinoxes mark the moment of least tilt. Chart shows the tilt of the earth in different seasons.

HEADLINE: ON THE MAP;
A City and Its River Make a Classroom for Camden Students

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

 BODY:
To Gracelyn Johnson, Camden's best learning environment is its environment. Ms. Johnson, a science teacher at Camden High School, is this year's recipient of the Cartledge Award for Excellence in Environmental Education, presented in Washington earlier this month by the nonprofit Conservation Fund and by Union Camp Corporation of Wayne, the paper products manufacturer.
In a program she began three years ago, 40 Camden seniors are studying the relationship of the Cooper River to the city's economic growth. They gauge water quality, investigate sources of pollution and hear from environmental professionals. Twenty students from the more affluent, suburban Cherry Hill High School West also participate. "One Cherry Hill student said she could not take part because there would be drive-by shootings," said Stanley Krantz, a teacher in Cherry Hill. 
 Ms. Johnson talked about the river as she strolled along its banks.
Q. How is the river related to the city?
A. Historically, the river was very important to farmers and manufacturers upstream. Back in the early part of the century, they wanted to dredge the river and they wanted to get Federal funds for that. And the Federal funds were only available for rivers. It was called Cooper Creek, so they changed the name to Cooper River and then they were eligible for the funds.
Historically, it's been important commercially. In more recent times, no, it's not. It is important in a sense that it's the watershed, and if we don't protect the watershed we have all kinds of problems with flooding and recharging our aquifer. And it's a big recreational thing now. All through Camden County there are parks all along it. There's a yacht club, they scull along the river, you have picnicking and baseball fields.
Q. Is pollution still dumped into the river?
A. Not any more. There were something like 40 sewage plants, and all these little towns and communities were dumping their primary treated sewage, which is just barely treated, into the river. So the river was nasty. But since the early 70's, when the Camden County Municipal Utilities Authority came on line, the river is almost swimmable -- not quite, but almost swimmable. The main pollution you see now is runoff from the oil from cars. Anything in the streets ends up in the river. If they salt streets in the winter, that ends up in the river. Fertilizers that people put on their lawns end up in the river.
Q. What your program like?
A. It's called an integrated environmental study. Integrated in the sense that you're not just using science to teach something. You're using science, math, English, writing, social studies, history. And you can use any environmental topic.
Talking about global warming and endangered species is interesting, but in order to grab their interest and keep students' interest, finding a local issue was real important. And that's what we do in this program; we find something that's in their neighborhood, in their backyard.
 Q. Does poverty hurt the environment?
A. In areas where people are scratching for a living and trying to keep their families fed, protecting the environment is not high on their list. But in this class, we're trying to show students that you don't have to be living in Cherry Hill or Haddonfield or some affluent area to care about your environment.
Q. Do the negative stereotypes about Camden bother you?
A. This happens to me all the time: people say, "Where do you work?" And I say Camden High. And they go, "You work there? Aren't you afraid? Do you feel safe?" I mean, I had two children and worked right up to the end of my pregnancy. Would I go to work pregnant if I was afraid? STEVE STRUNSKY

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
The Sky, and the Moon, for the Most-Frequent Fliers

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
WHEN the 23 million members of United Airlines' frequent-flier program awaken on Jan. 1, they will face not only a new year but also changes in the program's rules. Members who redeem miles for certain free flights will be required to stay over a Saturday night during their travel, and upgrades will be allocated differently.
United's members are not alone. Welcome to the changed -- and still changing -- world of airlines' frequent-flier programs. And while there are more ways than ever to obtain airline miles -- from grocery purchases to tuition payments -- a fundamental shift in strategy is giving new advantages to the airlines' best customers, those who usually travel for business and often pay the highest fares. 
 In many airline programs, the rewards for these big spenders are, well, big. Some of the most frequent travelers are reaping perks like bonus miles, preferred seating, special check-in desks, extra carry-on baggage allowances, early-boarding privileges and exclusive phone lines for reservations or complaints. But that's not all. Some airlines also offer them overnight delivery of award tickets, priority baggage delivery to airport carousels and access to airport clubs.
For people who travel a lot, such perks can help make even a grueling journey tolerable. Of course, the benefits are far from free.
To reach the upper frequent-flier tiers, customers must meet annual mileage minimums. To join United's Premier Executive level, American Airlines' Platinum or Continental's Elite Gold, passengers must fly 50,000 actual miles, or 60 flight segments, on purchased tickets during the year. A segment is industry language for any flight from one city to another; Los Angeles to New York is one segment, and Los Angeles to Chicago to New York is two segments.
One step -- and several perks -- below these categories are United's Premier level, American's Gold and Continental's Elite Silver, each requiring 25,000 miles or 30 segments. Continental also offers an Elite Bronze category, requiring 20,000 miles or 25 segments.
To insure the loyalty of their most frequent fliers, however, some carriers have begun adding even higher reward levels.
Northwest Airlines, for example, recently created an International Gold Elite card for the several thousand passengers -- out of its total of more than 52 million -- who travel frequently to Europe or Asia on first- or business-class fares. Among an array of other perks, these travelers are guaranteed confirmed reservations on any otherwise sold-out flight operated by Northwest.
United offers the Premier 1K level for passengers who fly at least 100,000 miles or 100 segments a year. In addition to most of the perks listed above, Premier 1K members are exempt from the blackout dates that apply to United's free tickets for off-peak travel.
Within the airline industry, the "road warrior," who travels often but sometimes on advance purchase, low-cost tickets, is becoming less important than the "high-yield passenger," "full-fare passenger" or "V.F.F.," or very frequent flier.
Almost without exception, these terms refer to the men and women flying on business who need to get where they are going tomorrow, if not yesterday, and pay for the privilege (through the nose, in the opinion of many travel managers) with high fares. About 25 percent of T.W.A. passengers, for example, account for half the carrier's revenue. Frequent travelers who pay full fare account for only 9 percent of United's passengers but 44 percent of its revenue.
Such figures help explain why American Airlines is giving 40,000 bonus miles to passengers who pay full fare for first- or business-class tickets to Europe and complete their travel by Jan. 31, 1998. That is in addition to the usual award miles for the trip.
The 40,000-mile bonus for travel to Europe is being offered by other airlines, too, with some variations: US Airways is offering it to its business-class travelers until Jan. 31, and Continental will add 10,000 more miles, for a bonus of 50,000, if business-class passengers pay with an American Express card. For business-class travelers on T.W.A., the travel deadline for the 40,000-mile bonus is Feb. 28.
In a departure from the mileage bonuses, British Airways will offer passengers who travel to Europe by Jan. 31 -- in first or business class or on the Concorde -- a free economy-class ticket to any British Airways destination in the world.
On most major carriers, the frequent-flier mileage for first-class passengers is 50 percent higher than for economy passengers (1.5 frequent-flier miles for each mile flown, rather than one for one), and 25 percent higher for business class.
 But airlines have also found other ways to bolster the award mileage for their highest-paying passengers and, in some cases, to deny it to those who pay the least.
T.W.A., which is making an all-out effort to attract the bigger spenders, gives full-fare passengers one mile for each mile flown and an additional mile for each dollar they spend on the ticket.
British Airways and most United States carriers deny frequent-flier mileage to passengers who fly with tickets issued by consolidators, who buy airlines' unsold seats at big discounts and sell them at lesser discounts. Several Asian carriers that fly to and from the United States, including Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines, award frequent-flier miles to first- and business-class passengers but not to those in economy class.
THE same is true of Cathay Pacific, which, for example, awards 24,202 miles to first-class passengers who fly the 16,134-mile round trip between New York and Hong Kong, and 20,168 miles to business-class passengers -- but none to economy passengers. Instead, economy passengers can accrue points, based on miles flown, toward membership in the airline's Marco Polo Club, which has perks like special check-in and access to airport lounges.
Qualifying Cathay Pacific award miles are redeemable on American Airlines, Malaysia miles are redeemable on Delta, and Singapore miles are redeemable on either American or Delta.
But while the mileage gap between the big spenders and bargain hunters has widened, it does not appear to have dampened the latter group's enthusiasm for flying, sometimes with no regard as to where.
When Cathay Pacific recently offered two round-trip tickets from the United States to Hong Kong for $999, including five free nights at a hotel, its phone lines were busy for days on end.
"Some of the people who called," an employee of the carrier said, "didn't know who or what Cathay Pacific was, didn't know where Hong Kong was, but just knew the offer was too good to pass up."

Strangers Behind a Counter

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
The store smelled like old chicken. But the poultry and hot dogs were cleared out weeks ago because business has been worse than the stink.
"We've made nothing in four hours," said Damin Kubler, a young man of Puerto Rican descent who is the daytime manager at Savings Food Super Market. "I've got nothing in the till." 
 This bodega could be anywhere in New York, on any nondescript street, on any unlucky corner. But it is on Cross Bay Boulevard in Broad Channel, a small island community built along the waters of the Big Egg Marsh in Jamaica Bay.
Part of the store's economic doldrums can be attributed to the seasonal downturn when the Rockaway beaches close for the winter and few people stop to pick up hot dog buns, baby diapers and cold beer, Mr. Kubler said.
But the merchants say they face another problem: resentment from longtime residents of this cloistered enclave on the city's edge, where according to the 1990 census, 99 percent of the people are white. Many are third-generation Channelites.
"They don't particularly care for black and brown," said Mr. Kubler, who moved to the island from East New York about a year ago. "If you can deal with the taunting, you can stick it out. But it's not so good for business."
The first immigrants to do business on the island were the Germans, who came in the late 19th century and dug for clams and oysters until the open sewers ruined the business.
Broad Channel was incorporated in 1915 and residents leased the land from the city. Hoteliers and Irish rumrunners came during Prohibition, and the area flourished as a resort until the corporation went bankrupt during the Depression.
After World War II, the people who were left on the island, which had no sewers or water mains, were mostly Irish squatters.
"It became insular because nobody wanted to buy a house without the property," said Dan Tubridy, who is from an established Broad Channel family.
Things changed in 1982, when the city finally decided to sell the property to residents. Sewers have been added since then and property values have increased 250 percent, said Daniel Mundy, president of the Broad Channel Civic Association. Some old timers have sold their homes, and immigrants have moved into the community. Seven of 12 businesses counted on the strip are foreign-owned.
Some locals have not bothered to learn the merchants' names, and many residents don't patronize their businesses.
"It's the way it is," said David Muhammed, a native of Saudi Arabia who works at the Cross Bay Delicatessen. "You can't make people like you."
At Eddy B's Tavern, Danny O'Sullivan, 67, talked about the good old days of an island paradise when the bay water was clear and the fishing plentiful.
"In 20 years, either this is going to be another Hamptons or another Shanghai," Mr. O'Sullivan said. "Nothing you can do to stop it." CHARLIE LeDUFF

Gentrification With a Twist: Keeping Nautical Tranquillity

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
Head from the Bronx River Parkway to the Pelham Parkway and cross the City Island Bridge. Abruptly you enter a marine village that seems to belong miles and miles from New York City. At first glance, City Island, a slow-paced community of 4,500, seems to be ruled by the commerce of the sea, with scores of pleasure boats and many seafood restaurants.
But nautical as its economy appears, City Island is becoming increasingly dependent on small restaurants that serve fancy coffee and double-chocolate cake; on galleries like the Focal Point, the Starving Artist and Ciao, which sell crafts, paintings and photographs, and on shops that frame them. Over the last decade or so these goods and services that appeal to day-tripping tourists have replaced the butcher, the shoemaker, the baker. 
 Gentrification has arrived on City Island. Take the reopening of the Black Whale, a gathering place that served richly memorable desserts and closed 15 years ago. Back then, everyone -- tourists, boaters, artists, local residents -- went to the Black Whale. "It was always a take-your-date-to-impress-her kind of place," said Cormac McEnery, a local lawyer. The new owners, John McGowan and Jim Kinny, are "clamdiggers," or natives of City Island. They say the reincarnated Black Whale should be ready by the end of December and they hope for the kind of success that greeted Le Refuge, the island's first bed-and-breakfast, which opened three years ago and has room for 20 guests. It has been followed by the tiny Nautical Museum, which has added hundreds of ship prints to its collection. Last year a $100,000 grant from the state paid for the refurbishing of storefronts along City Island Avenue. And the state is studying how much the island should get of preservation money for 10 Long Island Sound communities.
"It's sort of a renaissance," said Peter La Scala, the president of the City Island Chamber of Commerce. "It has an air of avant-garde. Property values are going up." A two-bedroom house on a very small lot is on the market for $180,000, nearly double what it sold for 10 years ago, said a real estate agent, Betty Esola,
Many people say they moved to the island for its feel of a quiet seaside village, but one within commuting distance of the rest of the city.
But some urban crime remains. A recent drive-by shooting that left one young man dead and another wounded shook some residents' feelings of security. Skippy Lane, a retired sea captain, remembers when the island was a center of custom yacht building. In 1982, the last island-built yacht was put to sea. But unlike some industrial cities that became ghost towns when their factories shut, City Island did not hit the skids, largely because most residents worked off-island in occupations ranging from waitressing to banking. Some boat builders turned to storage and repair, and the biggest boatyard became a condominium complex.
The island's downtown streets did suffer, though. Shops were vacant, their facades ragged. Local boosters plan to use state money on more refurbishing. But, Mr. McEnery insists, gentrification will continue to be atypical -- no Gaps, no Starbucks, no chains stores.
"This is not a pop-out-of-the-box place," he said. "This place makes you tranquil. As soon as you go over the bridge, you go: 'Ahhh.' " BARBARA STEWART

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Pain or Gain From Dental Management?

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
A NEW set of companies is hoping that more dentists will do what many doctors are already doing: have someone else manage their businesses.
Facing a mountain of administrative and marketing tasks, an increasing number of doctors in the last four years have turned to physician practice-management companies, or P.P.M.'s, for help. Now, 3 percent to 10 percent of all doctors use them. 
 So why not a dental practice-management company, or D.P.M.? The thought has occurred to many, with at least two dozen such companies springing up in the last year or two. Five of these concerns have gone public since the beginning of this year and another six hope to do the same in the next few weeks.
But while it does not take a dental mirror to see what is causing the stampede, the risks are high: the companies are tiny, the demand for them is untested and the stocks are volatile. Investors who are willing to court these dangers may choose to jump in now in search of big gains; others may prefer to wait and see how the industry shakes out.
The stakes are huge. Americans spend $46 billion a year on dentistry, and the market is growing about 6 percent a year, thanks to the aging of baby boomers and the development of whitening techniques and other treatments.
But dentistry is also a very fragmented profession, with about 70 percent of dentists, and about 90 percent of orthodontists, in solo practices.
That means that most dentists must do or oversee everything themselves, making them ripe for the services of D.P.M.'s. These enterprises not only rescue dentists from doing paperwork and hiring but they also do the marketing and supply capital for expansion. Some of the management companies sprang from group dental practices, and many have executives with dental and accounting backgrounds.
Such outside management should leave dentists with more time to see patients, which can raise revenues sharply. At Coast Dental Services in Sarasota, Fla., each dentist generates about $600,000 in gross revenues a year, on average, according to Joseph R. Smith, the chief financial officer. The average dentist in a traditional single practice, he said, generates only about $300,000 annually.
Typically in these contracts, the dentists receive a sizable payment up front -- in some combination of the management company's stock and cash -- plus the services. In return, the company receives a percentage of profits from the practice.
The American Dental Association has neither approved nor disapproved of the use of management companies. But some dentists are beginning to embrace them. "There's been a general feeling of adverseness to these companies in the past, but now dentists see the writing on the wall," said Steven Tuen, an analyst at IPO Value Monitor, a research firm in New York. "While there hasn't been any real momentum to get dentists to join up so far, that's starting to change."
And with only about 1 percent of dentists now participating, there is much room for growth.
THE trend toward managed care is another plus. By bringing economies of scale to dentistry, D.P.M.'s can often offer lower prices than traditional practitioners. This has great appeal for cost-conscious providers of managed dental care -- they now cover 23.8 million Americans -- and for the roughly half of Americans without dental insurance.
And by offering such conveniences as Saturday and evening hours and locations in shopping malls, D.P.M.'s can lure people who steer clear of the dentist's chair because they cannot find the time.
There is much to gain by attracting such customers. According to a study by the National Center for Health Statistics in 1993, the most recent year for which data are available, 39 percent of Americans did not visit a dentist in the past 12 months.
Some D.P.M.'s have designed strategies to draw these nonpatients. Coast Dental Services, for example, says its prices are 30 percent to 50 percent lower than those of dentists in solo practices.
Other management companies are separating themselves from the pack in different ways. The Gentle Dental Service Corporation of Vancouver, Wash., for example, is developing practices that combine dentists with periodontists and/or other specialists for one-stop shopping.
And the Monarch Dental Corporation, based in Dallas, pursues large, established dental practices -- a strategy that can be costly but that also provides strong market positions. Monarch also tries to grow internally, not just by acquisition.
These strategies please many investors. Coast's stock has risen from $8 at its offering in February to $24.75 on Friday, while Gentle Dental's stock, which went public at about the same time, has gone from $5 to $9.25.
But some weakness has emerged in the industry, too. Monarch's stock, after shooting up to more than $23 three months ago, closed on Friday at $11.625, less even than its July offering price of $13. And the stocks of two D.P.M.'s that went public this fall -- Castle Dental Centers and Dental Care Alliance -- have sunk below their offering prices.
A big reason for these troubles is typical for budding industries: new competitors. The Monarch, Castle and Dental stocks all declined this fall, when a handful of other D.P.M.'s announced plans to go public. And those companies would be coming on top of several privately held outfits that have also entered the fray.
One risk from such rivalries has already been seen: While dental-management companies have so far been mostly regional players, they are now beginning to step into one another's backyards. That is one reason Gentle Dental recently decided to merge with a private company, GMS Dental; both companies were pursuing dentists in California, Oregon and a few other states.
INVESTORS should also consider a troublesome parallel -- physician-management companies. Because of overly rosy expansion plans, growing competition and difficulties in getting doctors to change their business practices, P.P.M. stocks, as a group, have turned in disappointing results since the middle of last year.
Craig B. Dickson, an analyst in the Chicago office of Everen Securities, said physicians had been consolidating their practices for 25 years, so there was more potential for cutting overhead costs with dentists. He also said dental-management companies typically could generate higher revenues and higher margins than P.P.M.'s could.
Still, dental-management stocks, like the shares of many small growth companies, have shown they can be as jumpy as someone suffering from a crater-sized cavity. And if such stocks drop significantly, the expansion plans so crucial to a start-up sector can be harmed. That is because dental-management companies often offer large chunks of their stocks to dentists to get them to join. If the stocks sink, dentists might hold out.
The small size of dental-management enterprises also raises investor risks. Monarch, with just $24.2 million in annual sales last year, is the largest of the five public companies. The average annual revenue for the group is $12.8 million. (By comparison, the average annual revenues for P.P.M.'s is in the hundred-million-dollar range.)
Finally, there is the specter of a seller's market -- but not the kind that these management companies would like. To keep expansion on track, some of them have begun to pay premium prices to dentists to join their networks.
"This is a long-term fear within the industry," said one Manhattan money manager who holds a sizable position in Coast Dental and who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Dentists are seeing all the money that's flowing to these companies, and they're starting to demand higher prices. In other words, they're getting smart."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Big Stakes, Big Risks"
Management companies are sprouting up to do the hiring, paperwork and marketing for dentists, who preside over a $46 billion-a-year business. As more managers go public -- five have done so this year, and six others hope to do so soon -- some are devising ways to stand out from the crowd. Chart lists three public companies.

The Office Phone Vs. the Tug of Home

BYLINE: By JOHN BRAY 

 BODY:
WHEN her father died, Lisa Deuel Lachot had many telephone calls to make at work.
"That's not something you want to be talking about in your cubbyhole," said Ms. Lachot, 37, a secretary in Chapel Hill, N.C. "I knew which offices were open and which phones I could use. I'm not using their phone and charging it to their number. I was just using it to get privacy." 
 Personal phone calls at the office. It doesn't take an independent prosecutor to know that almost everyone makes them if given the chance. Some people have an easier time of it than others.
But even as the technology for monitoring such calls grows more sophisticated, some workplace experts say that letting people have personal phone time may not be a bad thing -- as long as they don't abuse it.
"There is a general trend toward acknowledging that people need to deal with things in order to be productive," said Arlene Johnson of Work Family Directions, a Boston consulting firm. That may include calling home to relieve a worry over the baby sitter, talking to the plumber or dealing with an insurance problem.
"You want to encourage calls so they aren't sitting there stewing," she said.
In white-collar offices with phones on every desk, personal calls tend to be at the worker's discretion, she said. And while companies are increasingly able to police such calls and thus reduce them, it is hard to balance the productivity gains against the losses.
"Obviously, people are making personal phone calls from work," said John Marshall, president of I. S. Associates of Troy, Mich., a telephone accounting system company. "Some companies care to track it and some don't, but the loss of productivity far outstrips the cost of the calls. I can place a call to my wife and it will cost 8.4 cents, but if I talk for two hours, then it becomes a productivity concern."
Personal calls can be more complicated on the shop floor than in an office.
When Levi Strauss & Company surveyed workers in 1990, the company learned that machine operators did not have enough access to telephones, said Margaret Kraemer, the company's employee assistance program leader, based in Knoxville, Tenn.
"What people requested was more phones," she said, noting that it was particularly difficult for parents to call home to check on children, especially during the summer. So the company installed more telephones in break rooms.
"They are pretty heavily used," Ms. Kraemer said. The company did not study the impact on productivity. But, she said, "just the fact that the parents were able to call out alleviated the problem of children calling in on the switchboard."
As a single mother at work 30 years ago, Caroline Lincoln felt compelled to keep from making personal calls, trying to stay in step with the vast majority of her co-workers, who had spouses at home to tend to daily domestic concerns.
"We sort of went to work and put on that work hat, and that's what we were to do," said Ms. Lincoln, who now places temporary workers for Smither & Associates of Chapel Hill, N.C. "We have so many mothers now who are working who need to be in touch with their children. I just think people are more relaxed about it now."
Employers have called to complain about temps making too many personal phone calls, Ms. Lincoln said. But such complaints are rare -- perhaps especially so in this time of low unemployment, when companies are trying to keep workers, not looking for ways to chase them away.
Some companies, however, forbid personal calls, noting the risks of tying up a business line. The phone handsets on the desk at D.L.C. Car Service at Westchester County Airport in White Plains are clearly labeled: "No Personal Phone Calls."
"It could cost us a $100 taxi or limo call because somebody couldn't get through," said Frank Yannuzzie, 70, who was running the desk one recent afternoon.
But for Leonard Johnson, 42, of White Plains, there was time to spare in the "boiler room" at a previous job where he made cold calls as a telemarketer for a home improvement company.
"We were calling girlfriends and friends all over the country," Mr. Johnson said. "When the manager would come in, we'd just pretend we were talking to a homeowner. As long as you were generating sales, they didn't care."
WHAT constitutes abuse of the phone for personal calls? Companies should have clear policies that telephones, like other office equipment, are for business, said Michael Lotito, a San Francisco lawyer who counsels companies on management disputes with labor.
But he said there should be no cause for alarm if a dedicated worker needed to make a personal call from the office for something urgent, or even something mundane.
"Maybe they are trying to see if the dry cleaner is open late because they just worked an hour overtime," said Mr. Lotito, a managing partner at the firm Jackson Lewis. 'To condemn this type of individual for making this type of call is ridiculous."
While there is abuse of business phones, "this isn't keeping corporate America awake at night," Mr. Lotito said.
Although companies may be trusting their workers about personal phone calls, many also have the means to flag calls that may indicate abuse and to produce detailed reports of incoming and outgoing calls.
The systems, which can cost less than $1,000 or hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on their size and capabilities, can be used to reconcile phone bills or to simply turn up inefficiencies in how calls are routed. But they can also produce detailed reports of calls to and from each extension.
Buyers of such systems rarely cite any concern about personal phone calls, said Tim Stassi, vice president of the Angeles Group, a Westlake Village, Calif., company that develops software for such systems.
"We've never promoted the system as a policing system," he said.
But making employees aware that calls are being tracked can still have a chilling effect. It did at the Sacramento Municipal Utility District.
"Supervisors would pull employees into their office and question them about calls," said Tom Santiago, telephone service superintendent for the electricity supplier. "Word got out and calls started going down."
At Engineering Global Solutions, a consulting firm in Dearborn, Mich., workers pay for their personal calls on an honor system.
"It has been the source of much humor and complaint," said Janis O'Hare, the personnel manager, who distributes the printouts of the calls.
One co-worker, who makes a lot of phone calls for Engineering Solutions, took his printout "and draped it over his body and just looked at us," she said. "Another guy would let them pile up in his drawer until the boss said, 'Just deduct it all from his paycheck.' Mostly people paid them because they know how our boss is."
Yes, people know how most bosses are.
"If I'm working at a desk and the boss is sitting right nearby, I'm not going to just pick up the phone and start doing my errands," said Ms. Lachot, the secretary in North Carolina. "People understand if you need to make a call, but, on the other hand, I don't think they want to hear you making it."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
The Eagle Platinum Coin Is Selling, but Not Soaring

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
THE United States Mint began to sell its first platinum coins in late September, when the white precious metal was in its best rally since 1990.
The spot price of platinum was up almost 18 percent for the year, and the future looked good from several angles. For the first time since 1988, the demand for platinum significantly exceeded the supply. The potential of platinum as a commodity -- not just a precious metal -- seemed higher, too, with more people convinced that its use in catalytic converters and electronics would grow with the economy. The price of spot gold was off by more than 12 percent at the time, and that was also auspicious: It suggested that platinum was loosening its link to the long-falling price of gold. 
 Finally, the mint was expected to sell 100,000 ounces of the coins over the next year -- which would push prices up more.
And sell the mint did. Through last week, the mint had sold more than 108,000 ounces of its American Eagle platinum coins, quickly meeting its one-year sales forecast and ravaging the competition, the Australian Koala and the Canadian Maple Leaf. "Koala sales are down to a trickle," said George Hall, a consultant to the Perth Mint of Western Australia.
But what has been great for the mint has not turned out so well for some investors.
No sooner had the sales started than the price of platinum began to plummet. And because the price the mint charges for the coin tracks the metal's spot price, the early investors lost a bundle. The first 25,000 one-ounce bullion coins, which are marketed to investors rather than collectors, sold for $424 plus the mint's 3 percent markup. On Friday, though, the spot price of an ounce of platinum was just $356.50.
The reversal underscores how volatile investments in precious metals -- even nice stocking-stuffers like coins from the United States Mint -- have been in recent years.
Investors might look at this performance as they think about the new opportunity, beginning next year, to add precious-metal coins and bars to their individual retirement accounts. They should know, too, that most advisers say these metals should be just a small part of a portfolio, and that they have recently failed in their long-promoted role as hedges in bad times.
The nature of the recent downturn in platinum has sorely disappointed those whose aspirations for the metal had soared during its rally. The hope that platinum had broken its link to gold, for instance, has been undermined. The price of gold has fallen 10 percent since late September and has dragged platinum with it, analysts say.
Even more disappointing is that this year's rally -- which sent platinum's price up 29 percent, to $479 an ounce at the peak in June -- may have been just a one-time buying spree rather than a sign of a new, higher, continuing demand for the metal.
In normal times, platinum users borrow the metal at very low interest rates rather than actually buy it outright, which would require a lot more cash. But these borrowers were squeezed this year when Russia suddenly stopped shipping platinum to the West. That shortage of physical platinum sent short-term platinum borrowing costs up to an annual rate of 300 percent, forcing many companies to make large purchases of the metal.
"It was a high volume of purchases, but it was one-time," said a New York trader whose firm has a big stake in platinum and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
In addition, the economic turmoil in Asia has been cutting into demand from Japan, a large consumer of platinum. A report on Tuesday showing that executives in Japan were pessimistic about the economic outlook sent the price of platinum down 3 percent, although it rebounded the next day on the announcement of a possible income tax cut there.
All told, "The next one to two years are not necessarily positive for platinum," the trader said.
But are things now so bad with platinum that they're good? After all, the 1-ounce price is down more than 25 percent from its June high.
William Nellus, vice president for sales and marketing at the Monex Deposit Company, a wholesaler and retailer of precious metals in Newport Beach, Calif., thinks so. Customers "are looking at the falling price of platinum as an opportunity," he said.
To spur sales, Mr. Nellus said, Monex has dropped its 10-ounce minimum-purchase rule to market a set of the four sizes of the coin: ounce, half-ounce, quarter-ounce and one-tenth ounce, in denominations from $100 to $10.
Jacques Luben, the executive director of the Platinum Guild International, said that although the mint's coin "could not have come out into a worse market," the price would rebound as long as Asia recovered and growth continued in the West.
"I would argue that platinum is doing everything it should be doing -- responding to a strong economy -- except for the last few weeks," Mr. Luben said.
Mr. Luben may be right, or maybe the platinum trader is. But either way, if you want platinum coins for fun -- not profit -- they are surely a better buy now than in September.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
On Long Island, the Mall as History Book

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
THE mall is like a member of your family: Like it or hate it, chances are you have to visit at least a few times a year -- especially at the holidays -- and you're probably too close to realize how much it has changed over time.
Of course, some of the change is obvious at a mall like Long Island's Roosevelt Field, at 2.2 million square feet the nation's seventh-largest mall, where a $150 million renovation in 1993 turned what was an everyday shopping center into a huge regional mall with dozens of new stores and a giant food court in the shape of a zeppelin. More than two million shoppers visit in an average month -- closer to three million in November and December. 
 But it is the subtler changes at Roosevelt Field -- the ones reflecting the demographic, financial and cultural swings of the country -- that best tell the story of retailing in America in the 40-odd years during which malls have come to dominate shopping.
Over the decades, Roosevelt Field's tenant lists and floor plans make clear that this mall, like malls in so many American towns, has been a sort of commercial petri dish for the suburban experience.
Here is the rise and fall -- and rise -- of the suburban department store. The disappearance of the local merchant in the face of relentless expansion by a relative handful of national retailers. The supplanting of the homemaker by the working woman as the mall's prime market. The breakdown of class distinctions in American tastes.
The scene is so familiar to holiday shoppers who will throng malls today, the end of the busiest weekend of the year: Dozens of stores with marked-down wool sweaters shoved to the front racks. Stroller brigades of droopy-eyed toddlers. Dazed men and women weighted down with department store bags. A maddening, casino-like absence of clocks.
But it sprang from something far more modest.
 
The Early Years: Anchor Stores
Since Roosevelt Field opened in 1956 on the site of a Garden City airstrip that served as Amelia Earhart and Charles Lindbergh's launch pad in the 1920's, one constant has been Macy's. That underscores an essential, if at times severely tested, truth: The department store rules the mall.
From the beginning of the mall-building boom of the late 1950's, department stores set the tone and ran the show. Like Macy's at Roosevelt Field, stores that committed to anchor malls got space from the developers -- in this case William Zeckendorf -- for nominal fees.
The specialty stores, many of them local businesses that migrated from the town village, paid stiffer rents and prayed for walk-by business from department-store customers relieved at being spared shopping trips back to the city neighborhoods they had fled.
"The developers knew the department-store guys and did deals with them," said Henry D. Jackson, managing director of the Peter J. Solomon Company, an investment bank that specializes in the retail industry. "And the specialty stores were willing to pay high rent because they didn't need to pay advertising."
Specialty stores were hardly the draw they are now. There was no Bath & Body Works with its fruit-scented soaps, no jam-packed housewares stores like Pottery Barn bringing their pastel visions of home decorating to the suburbs.
Most of Roosevelt Field's original tenants -- shops like Hanan's Yarn and Paree Millinery, which were geared to the homemaker with children -- have closed and been forgotten.
If some of the old retailing concepts seem quaint -- like the Corsetorium, which sold women's undergarments -- they hint at the needs met by today's retailers, like the mall's 8,000-square-foot Victoria's Secret store.
The first big change in the mall landscape was also one of the most profound: the enclosing of large numbers of outdoor centers beginning in the 1960's, a trend that reached Roosevelt Field in 1968. Not only did roofs raise the year-round shopping possibilities many times over, but they changed the economics of building a mall.
"The costs were tremendous," noted Leonard L. Farber, the founding president of the International Council of Shopping Centers and a longtime mall developer. With the number of shoppers skyrocketing, "if you wanted to build a 1,000-square-foot store, you needed 5,000 square feet of parking to go with it."
There was nothing terribly fancy about Roosevelt Field in those years. With stores like Sears, Woolworth and Walgreen's -- all tenants at Roosevelt Field in 1963 -- the mall catered to middle-class shoppers and their values.
"If you think about the customer in the 1960's, most of the people going to suburbs are young families in starter homes, and that defined what stores went out there," said Mary Ellen Brigham, a professor of marketing at the University of Connecticut. "Sears grew on that whole premise. By the 1960's, it had 800 stores, which was huge."
Carriage-trade merchants disdained malls, sticking to their downtown redoubts. "Neiman Marcus, Lord & Taylor and Bonwit Teller held back," Mr. Farber said. "If you were real fancy and accustomed to very high-class merchandise, you wanted to still go to Fifth Avenue."
But fewer and fewer Long Islanders wanted to make the trip. "Roosevelt Field exemplified that transition from city-oriented Long Island to a locally centered life style," said Roger Wunderlich, a professor of Long Island history at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
"There was this new interconnected network of places to shop, and campus-like office complexes, industrial parks, schools and hospitals all accessible by parkway," he said. "It was the beginning of post-suburban Long Island, where people not only live but work."
 
The Middle Years: Courting Teens
After surviving the bankruptcy of Mr. Zeckendorf's company, Webb & Knapp Inc., and falling into new hands, Roosevelt Field, like many other malls by the 1970's, had become an unavoidable fixture of the retailing landscape for merchants and shoppers. (There were 983 regional malls in 1976 -- hundreds more than in the 1960's but still less than half the number today.) Malls had emerged as the new village green, imprinting themselves on the minds of children with fashion shows and concerts and Santa Claus castles that a decade before would have been held at the local Y or the high school auditorium.
But the dynamics of the mall were changing. An entrepreneur in Ohio named Leslie H. Wexner began to challenge conventional wisdom about both the mall shopper and the omnipotence of the department store. In the inflationary 70's, he saw a way to insure that malls thrived as working adults felt financially squeezed: by appealing to teen-agers who would be big-spending customers when times improved.
Mr. Wexner's little shops, known as the Limited, were geared to young women, and at first opened in just a few malls. The Limited made it to Roosevelt Field in 1979. Other stores catering to younger working women started popping up in malls around the country: Casual Corner, Foxmoor, Jean Nicole and others each had dozens of mall outlets by the end of the decade. By then, too, some specialty stores had their own credit cards, which with their easy terms gave many young shoppers their first plastic.
"The Limited was the wake-up call," said Mr. Jackson, the investment banker. "In the early 1970's, there was a real generation gap, and the Limited was saying to that younger customer, 'We understand what you want and we will focus on you.' Wexner gets all the credit for that change at the mall."
Nothing drove changes at the mall as much as the changing life style of the American woman. By 1979 at Roosevelt Field, the Singer Sewing Center and stores like the Fabric Tree had been joined not only by Foxmoor, Casual Corner and Jean Nicole, but also by Lerner Shops and Te-Te La Pitus, all catering to the working woman. In Nassau County, her numbers had grown by 45 percent over the decade.
The 1980's started as the heyday of the mall -- and ended in disaster.
As Mr. Wexner plotted the rise of the specialty store, Robert Campeau, an eccentric Canadian developer who headed the Campeau Corporation, was making a series of moves that wrecked the department store, at least temporarily.
Outfitted with junk bonds, the decade's most fashionable financial accessory, Mr. Campeau went on a buying spree. He acquired department-store chains through leveraged buyouts, dismissed workers, sliced costs and then stood by, paralyzed by $8 billion in debt, as chains like Bonwit Teller, Bloomingdale's and Burdines tumbled toward bankruptcy. The house of cards finally collapsed in bankruptcy in 1990.
Other merchants moved quickly to capitalize on the vulnerabilities that Mr. Campeau put in such high relief. Specialty stores scooped up shoppers who abandoned department stores that were left threadbare, thinly staffed and all but service-free in Mr. Campeau's wake.
"In the late 80's, department stores were less predictable on the cash-flow side and were no longer bringing in the customer," recalled Therese Byrne, publisher of Retail Maxim, a newsletter that focuses on real estate issues in the retail business. "Stores like the Limited said, 'Hey, I'm the new anchor; start giving me some concessions.' "
A Limited executive recalled how malls began offering incentives to specialty retailers: big rent abatements or heavy infusions of cash for store improvements. The Limited began to spread its brands across the mall, buying or opening such chains as Express, Lane Bryant and Victoria's Secret.
At Roosevelt Field, where sales remained strong, specialty tenants had fewer opportunities to snare juicy deals. "In times of economic weakness, retailers got very picky about locations and would demand allowances," said Martin Fell, senior vice president of Corporate Property Investors, the New York real estate investment trust that has owned the mall since 1973. "Roosevelt Field has always been a strong center, so generally we have only paid allowances to tenants who were high quality and who we particularly wanted in the mall."
Outside the mall, "category killers" -- stores like Petsmart and Bed, Bath & Beyond that specialize in a single category of merchandise -- began to populate shopping centers in Roosevelt Field's backyard and in strip malls around the country. Here, shoppers found low prices and broad choice, without the headaches of weaving through the mall. Mail-order shopping, once the recourse of rural shoppers, began to be a mainstay of harried suburbanites, too.
So by 1990, when the recession hit -- nowhere as deeply and tenaciously as on Long Island -- and women reduced their spending on clothes, the Limited found itself in the same position as the department stores just a few years earlier -- dated and floundering.
 
Into the 90's: The Lure of Luxury
The retailing changes and economic pain left their mark on Roosevelt Field.
Alexander's was gone, and so was Gimbel's. Many of the young women's shops, like Foxmoor and Here and Now, had lasted barely 20 years. Others, like Jean Nicole and Merry-Go-Round, would disappear soon, victims of over expansion, quality problems and their failure to stock appropriate clothing for the junior shopper who had matured.
Embattled and searching for ways to grow, some malls turned to multiscreen movie theaters, in keeping with a big theme of retailing in the 1990's: the merger of shopping and entertainment. But another group, including Roosevelt Field, seized another trend: the lure of luxurious, high-style goods for even the moderately affluent shopper.
In came Nordstrom, the Coach Store, Tourneau and the Disney Store. Out went stores like Woolworth, which, if they no longer served the mall's target market, were sorely missed by longtime customers.
"You had your needle and thread, your shoelaces and pencils and stockings, too, there. Where do you go for that now?" said Helen Boroski, 77, who has traveled from her home in Glen Head, N.Y., to Roosevelt Field for 30 years and sat in its food court munching pizza on a recent afternoon.
The aesthetic changed considerably from the 1970's, reinforcing the mall's new glamour. Roosevelt Field tore down "La Petite Mall," a Tudor-style expansion built in 1974 that had architecturally reinforced the novelty of shopping indoors. The 1993 renovation brought a common area that simulates an open-air market, with high ceilings, skylights, imported marble tiling and modern metal fixtures.
Indeed, Mrs. Boroski enjoys the new face of the mall as much as the teen-agers to whom it is geared. "You can get rested here now," she said, waving her arm around the packed food court. "It used to be you had to go downstairs to a frankfurter stand."
For anyone who grew up shopping in malls, there is a strange link between the past and present at Roosevelt Field. There is still Spencer Gifts, that draw for every pre-teen-ager with its forbidden aisles of dirty gag jokes, and Things Remembered, the outpost for all things engraved.
Bustling with business just down the linoleum road are stores that play to shoppers' desire to experience everything before they buy it. At M.A.C. Cosmetics, women combine trendiness with anti-bacterial caution, dipping lipsticks into alcohol before trying them. At Williams-Sonoma, the sales clerks warm cider and help a gaggle of shoppers pick out cooking supplies. At Nordic Track, baby boomers work up a sweat on the exercise equipment before buying themselves back into a size 6 or a 32-inch waist.
"You can't just put your merchandise on a shelf anymore," said John Konarski, vice president of the International Council of Shopping Centers in Manhattan. "You have to be able to smell it, touch it and feel it."
A new crop of stores for young women underscores how fast retail cycles are moving. Their defunct predecessors had depended on Asian manufacturing, which often meant it took too long to get clothes into the stores; by the time they arrived, the garments had already fallen out of fashion -- a death knell when you are selling to fickle teen-agers.
Instead, chains that survived the 80's triage or opened more recently at Roosevelt Field -- like Wet Seal, Contempo Casuals and Rampage -- buy or make most of their clothes domestically, quickly moving inventory to keep the shelves fresh.
"The fallout of the other juniors chains has led to new chains which are focusing on very short lead times," said Allan Laufgraben, the former chief executive of Petrie Stores, which owned Jean Nicole, Marianne and Stuarts. "They have eliminated most of the import market. The trend now is very fast looks."
Today, men and women shop side by side in popular specialty stores like the Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch and J. Crew. These stores market a life style, rather than catering to a thin market segment.
The shopper now moves easily through all these stores. The "Limited shopper" will peek in department stores for their perpetual sales; the "Neiman Marcus shopper" will happily go to Kmart rather than to a fancy garden store for some potting soil.
Indeed, the department store, with its own improved private-label merchandise, depth of brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Jones New York and constant sales, has enjoyed a rebirth unimaginable after Mr. Campeau scorched their earth.
"I love the variety here," said Dolis Estevez, 20, who works and lives in Queens but shops at Roosevelt Field. "I go to Bloomingdale's and Kenneth Cole and the Gap and the inexpensive shoe stores. I like a mix."
Indeed, mall owners, faced with the unrelenting reality that shoppers have dozens of options outside the mall, are always looking for new lures -- and new ways to get productivity out of every corner of their spaces. At Roosevelt Field, for example, a dozen leased kiosks with names like Glass Sculpturing, Magic Pens and Running Out of Time crowd the aisles.
Still, in retailing's Darwinist ways, sprawling malls like Roosevelt Field -- with their varied tenants, affluent shoppers and rich owners -- can get away with low productivity in pockets of their cavernous halls. But nearing the end of the 90's, smaller, less high-end malls are having to go back to their roots of 40 years ago.
"I think what is going to happen is that upscale malls like Roosevelt Field will continue," said Ms. Byrne, the newsletter publisher. "The secondary malls are going to have to find another way to integrate into the community. Either they will offer medical services for the elderly or add post offices or whatever. They have to go back to the drawing board."

UPPER LEVEL
 
COFFEE BEANERY
It is now completely acceptable to give coffee beans as a gift. In the 1970's, you gave a Hickory Farms cheese log. That chain was seemingly in every mall back then; today Hickory Farms has half the number of stores it did in the 1970's, a casualty of the introduction of delis within grocery stores. The company supplements its catalogue business with seasonal kiosks in malls, though not at Roosevelt Field.
 
FOOD COURT
A giant food court was a highlight of the mall's renovation in 1993. Back in 1959, the hungry had to satisfy themselves at Francis Tomasino's Delicacies. Now, there are gyros, Chinese food, tacos and donuts, in addition to a range of restaurants elsewhere in the mall.
 
STRUCTURE
Serves the casually-dressed young man. Professional men must now look in department stores or leave the mall entirely in search of tailored clothing. Casual Fridays and men's infrequent suit purchases made it difficult for stores like Harvey's Haberdashers, an original tenant, to survive.
 
POTTERY BARN
In the 1960's and 1970's, homemaking goods were available at stores like the Fabric Tree. High rent squeezed such stores out of the mall. Now, people can buy their curtains (and pillows and candles and fish platters) here.
 
BCBG
A core group of contemporary women's shops like this one, with clothing more expensive than junior merchandise but less expensive than the designer brands found in department stores, has found a niche in the 90's mall.
 
SWEET FACTORY
Quickly becoming a mall staple, where you can buy candy by the pound, self- served. A few decades ago, mall candy resided almost exclusively behind the fingerprint-covered glass cases at Fannie Farmer and Fannie May stores.
 
THE LIMITED
The store that changed the way American women shopped. It turned the tables on department stores, taking away market share and usurping some of their economic power with mall management. Today, the chain is struggling to keep up with current fashions.
 
MAIN LEVEL
 
THE GAP
In 1976, there were 134 Gap stores. Today, there are 1,021. The company started the unisex dressing trend, ushering in a group of stores that sell clothes for an imagined life style, instead of one category of merchandise for one age group or gender. Followers included Abercrombie & Fitch, Banana Republic, Eddie Bauer and French Connection.
 
CONTEMPO CASUALS
The juniors business, which hit the skids at the end of the 1980's, is enjoying a rebound in the 90's.
 
LE MARC'S CARD & PARTY
One of the few original Roosevelt Field tenants still in the mall. Others are Bakers and Stride-Rite shoe stores.
 
LIDS
This little store, which sells sports hats, started as a kiosk in the mall aisles. Kiosks offer a way for merchants to test new concepts and for mall owners to make money in every corner of the mall.
 
VICTORIA'S SECRET
Is there a mall that doesn't have one of these stores, owned by a unit of the Limited, that sell two-for-one panties and asset-enhancing bras? Back in 1963, women shopped for foundations, the polite word for undergarments, at the mall's Corsetorium.
 
MACY'S
The original Roosevelt Field anchor. Through the years, department stores that have come and gone at Roosevelt Field include Gimbel's (which became Stern's), Alexander's and Abraham & Strauss.
 
WILLIAMS-SONOMA
Has made buying paring knives fun. In 1973, would Hofritz Cutlery have served its shoppers snacks and cider?

Black, White and Poles Apart

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG

 BODY:
AS President Nelson Mandela lashed out at whites last week, saying they had come to believe that in exchange for giving up political power they could keep their positions of economic privilege, many blacks in South Africa applauded. Finally, their beloved President had told it the way it was. He had expressed an anger that has been building steadily here in the three and half years since this country held the first elections in which everyone was given the right to vote.
The problem is that the vote has not transformed the day-to-day life of most black South Africans. They are still surviving on corn meal dinners. Their tin shacks still rattle in the rain. Jobs are still impossible to find. 
 That there should be anger is not so surprising. And that this anger might be directed at whites, who own most of the land and run most of the businesses, isn't that surprising, either.
But black anger is not the only anger out there.
Many whites are getting fed up too, even the most liberal ones who helped abolish the system. In the heady early days, blacks and whites embraced each other over rugby and soccer victories, but these days suspicion and resentment often prevail.
Last month, when Sampie Terreblanche, a well-known Afrikaner academic here, publicly proposed that whites should pay a wealth tax to finance reparations for blacks hurt by apartheid, the outcry from whites was deafening, he said, and included a mountain of hate mail.
He believes his proposal would have been accepted just three years ago. "Whites were more humble then," he said. "They were prepared to take some knocks."
 
Two-Way Street
Mr. Terreblanche is hardly alone in believing that South Africa is becoming more polarized.
More and more South Africans are acknowledging that the hopeful notion of a "rainbow nation," and the harmony it suggests, may be even more elusive than the great American melting pot. Blacks and whites now see things very differently and they are hardening in their positions.
Writing in The Sunday Independent last week, Shaun Johnson, a political correspondent turned newspaper executive, said that blacks believe whites have failed abjectly in seeing reconciliation as a two-way street. Now that apartheid is gone, he wrote, all that whites want to do is get on with their lives.
"This is taken to be shockingly ungrateful, unrepentant, arrogant and -- the warning note is shrill -- unacceptable behavior," said Mr. Johnson, who is white.
On the other hand, he said, whites don't know what blacks are talking about.
"Whites feel that far from lagging behind, 'transformation' in the country has run rampant, that they have borne the brunt of it, will continue to do so," he said, "and are being offered no honorable long-term place in society."
Though whites and blacks share the same country, most still live in separate, if not disparate, worlds. And their experiences over the last few years have shaped what are perhaps irreconcilable outlooks.
Whites, who are 12 percent of the population, have lost any sense of political power.
The African National Congress, with 252 of the 400 seats in Parliament, is the biggest party in the country. It really doesn't need the cooperation of any other party to pass legislation unless it wants to change the Constitution, which requires a 75 percent majority. And, while the A.N.C. has lost support in recent polls, most of its disaffected voters are really in the undecided category and may well return to the party as the 1999 elections near.
There is also crime.
For the first time whites are finding violence on their doorsteps as the barriers that kept the poor locked in black townships come down. Crime has always been a part of life in the townships, where the police were really only a riot control force and spy network. Besides, just before the 1994 elections, the townships were at war as the A.N.C. fought it out with Inkatha, the second-largest black party, led by the Zulu Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi. So violence and mindless brutality has been a given for blacks, but its presence radically changes the way whites feel about their homeland.
Then there is the economy. It grew only about 2 percent this year and produced no new jobs. This means that for blacks to get jobs, whites have to lose theirs. Various surveys indicate that whites are beginning to lose their wealth. Slightly fewer of them are in the middle class than before; their pay increases have also not kept up with inflation, which is at 8 percent. Though a black elite has developed, their wealth has not yet trickled down to the masses. So poor blacks feel they are getting nothing while whites feel they are losing ground.
One survey published last summer found that pessimism is four times higher among whites than blacks. Almost half of South Africa's whites expected to be worse off in a year.
But some political analysts say the A.N.C. is exaggerating racial polarization.
Steve Friedman, who heads the Center for Policy Studies, says Mr. Mandela's speech, given at the A.N.C.'s national party conference, was pure party politics -- an effort to unite the membership behind a common goal, in the same way that the former National Party used to rail against the threat of Communism.
Mr. Mandela did not ask whites to do anything, Mr. Friedman points out, except for a vague request to stop criticizing affirmative action programs.
Mr. Friedman says he has researched the speeches of the more outspoken Deputy President, Thabo Mbeki, looking for any directions to whites and has found virtually none. Mr. Mbeki is Mr. Mandela's likely successor at the A.N.C. as well as in the presidency.
"He is specific," said Mr. Friedman, "only on affirmative action -- it is a good idea -- and on, 'We don't like to be criticized.' "
But with more than 350 international news organizations signed up to cover the speech, Mr. Mandela must have known his audience was far wider than the 3,000 party delegates who gathered in the remote northern town of Mafikeng.
Since then, both Mr. Mandela and Mr. Mbeki have sought to play down the anti-white remarks, but most newspapers with largely white audiences have taken Mr. Mandela -- who enjoys enormous support among whites -- to task on their editorial pages for being vituperative and for failing to give an uplifting speech.
Some South Africans see progress, however, in these hostilities being brought out in the open.
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the chairman of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, who won the Nobel Peace prize for his efforts against apartheid, said recently that it was time to be more honest in recognizing differences in perspective between the races.
He summed up the mood of the country by saying that blacks resent the failure of whites to realize how lucky they are while whites resent the burden of guilt they carry for benefiting from the racial system.
"And so we sit in our little corners feeling angrier and angrier," he said. "But I still think we have a great deal going for us. If we could have the courage maybe to be a little more honest."

HEADLINE: Hand Wringing;
Thinking About Race With a One-Track Mind

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BILL LANN LEE will be making history as the first Asian-American to become the Federal Government's chief enforcer of civil rights laws. As a Horatio Alger-like symbol Mr. Lee couldn't be topped -- the son of penniless Chinese immigrants who worked hard and graduated with honors from Yale and Columbia Law School. As a civil rights lawyer, he was considered superbly qualified even by adversaries.
So what's wrong with this picture? Why did President Clinton have to bypass a hostile Senate Judiciary Committee and settle last week for naming him Acting Attorney General? The answer is affirmative action. 
 The problem the Administration faced with the Lee nomination is emblematic of how much the concept of providing minorities and women special breaks to compensate for discrimination -- past or present, real or imagined, intentional or inadvertent -- dominates the nation's obsession with race relations.
President Clinton says he doesn't like the focus on it. Members of the panel named to advise him on his national initiative on race strive to avoid being too closely identified with it. But they can't get away from it. And so it seemed last week: First, Mr. Clinton appointed Mr. Lee, whose support of affirmative action threatened his nomination. A few days later, the President was meeting at the White House with conservatives who had complained that his initiative had ignored affirmative action opponents.
"It's desperately difficult to broaden this policy discussion beyond affirmative action because it's the highest pole in the storm," said Christopher Edley Jr., a Harvard University law professor who is a consultant to Mr. Clinton's race initiative panel.
It is curious to many in the thick of the nation's racial debates that affirmative action looks like such a huge issue. It costs little, at least in comparison to social services. In some areas, like contracting, it hardly affects the vast majority of Americans. When whites are asked in public opinion polls whether they have ever lost a job or a promotion or been denied college admission as a result of affirmative action, few say yes.
Even the high-profile fights over admission to top-tier colleges are arguably battles between white and minority elites that have little to do with the bulk of college applicants. According to the Educational Testing Service, in 1995 only 7.3 percent of all four-year colleges admitted less than half of their applicants. The E.T.S. says that 52.7 percent of four-year colleges admit more than three-quarters of their applicants. So for the vast majority of American students, discrimination and affirmative action in admissions -- at least at the undergraduate level -- are irrelevant. What rankles is much more a matter of principle than personal stake.
"You can look at those figures and ask, why are black folks making such a big deal out of affirmative action?" Mr. Edley said. "That's the wrong question. The real question is why are white folks making such a big deal out of it?"
And it is a big deal. Mr. Clinton's only major civil rights initiative in his first term was a review of Federal affirmative action policy and his resolution to mend it, not end it. Last year, California voters approved a ballot initiative to ban preferences based on race or sex in state hiring, contracting or admission to public colleges and universities. The President's race relations advisory board drew sharp criticism last month for not seeking out the views of affirmative action opponents -- an accusation that Mr. Clinton tried conspicuously to deflect with his Oval Office meeting Friday.
 
One Last Issue
It is in part by default that affirmative action dominates the nation's discussion of race relations. Many other flash points are receding, for better or for worse. Crime rates, especially violent street crime rates associated in much of the public's mind with minority groups, are falling. Welfare rolls are dropping. The robust economy is reducing poverty rates, and the high school graduation rate among blacks is rising. "This seems to be the tangible issue that people feel they can directly address," said Jonathan Coleman, the author of "Long Way to Go," a study of race relations in Milwaukee. "There are a lot of complaints from people trying to get their arms around race relations in the 90's about what are the issues. Well, this is the issue."
Some say it is an easy issue for politicians and the news media to focus on. It lends itself to sound bites and expressions of high moral principle like fairness, equality, color-blindness and inclusiveness. It avoids vexing questions like what to do about the failure of minority schools, the growing class divide within minority groups and the stereotypes that keep Americans apart. At the recent town meeting on race he held in Akron, Ohio, Mr. Clinton spent considerable time on affirmative action, but barely probed beneath the surface of an observation by a young white man that if he spots a poorly dressed black man on the street he becomes "a little bit scared."
"Perceptions are part of the gray areas," said Mr. Coleman. "That's where people need to be going, into those gray areas. And that's where people are most afraid. So it's easy to line up behind polarized positions. It requires less courage."
Also, it seems, less candor. Proponents of preferences often shy away from using the word, arguing that any African American or Hispanic person or any woman, whether the child of a doctor or a derelict, has been so disadvantaged by racism and sexism that extending a break only evens the score. Some opponents say they have no problems with heightened recruitment and outreach efforts, but when pressed say such special efforts should not be based on race or sex.
"We've got to talk about these things in concrete and specific ways," said Lani Guinier, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. "You can't talk in the abstract. It's as if we're pledging allegiance to a set of abstract principles and fighting over which of these abstract principles everyone should follow."
Whatever the reason, the attention given affirmative action is sometimes lamented even by those who help thrust it onto center stage. "It's not the only issue," said Abigail Thernstrom, the co-author of the newly published "America in Black and White" and an affirmative action opponent who participated in the White House meeting Friday. "It's the issue on which people are not going to change their minds. There aren't a lot of fence-sitters on this question."
At his news conference last week, Mr. Clinton also expressed a weariness with the subject, wishing the debate would move beyond the "I'm-for-it-and-you're-against stage" to how the country insures the continued advancement of minority groups either with or without affirmative action. "That debate, I would suggest to you, is in its infancy," he added.
 
Hostile Environment
Nevertheless, the country seems to be at an edgy stalemate on the issue. Public opinion remains hostile to the idea of granting breaks on the basis of race or sex. The Federal courts have eliminated or sharply curbed race-conscious programs to help members of minority groups in contracting, employment and college admissions and financial aid. Yet the courts decline to drop the other shoe and say such programs are always unconstitutional. Republican opponents in Congress may block the nomination of an affirmative action advocate like Mr. Lee, but balk at legislation that would do away with Federal affirmative action programs.
With the country unable to press forward on affirmative action and unwilling to go back, only one thing can be assured: everyone will be talking about it next year, when Mr. Clinton has promised to resubmit Mr. Lee's name to Congress for confirmation, and probably for much longer.

HEADLINE: Remember the Neediest Children

 BODY:
While delighting in the angels and lights of Rockefeller Center and the expectant crowds in busy stores, it is easy to forget that there are children for whom the comforts of a warm jacket and a good meal would count as special blessings.
A report released last week showed that the poorest fifth of families in New York State had an average income of $6,787 a year, a decline from 10 years ago when adjusted for inflation. The demand at local food banks and soup kitchens is soaring as single mothers face new restrictions on welfare and immigrant families are denied food stamps. Children in these families live with deprivation because their parents cannot find work or earn too little to fend off hunger, while others have been abandoned to the foster care system. Such poverty seems cruelest this month, perhaps because even the poorest children still dream that something wonderful will happen at Christmas. 
 As Times readers prepare for the holidays this week, we hope they will be inspired to share what they can with children who have so little. One way to help is through a donation to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which supports seven New York City charities that provide food, housing assistance, medical care and social services to the poor all year. None of the money will be diverted for administrative expenses.
A contribution will help the Children's Aid Society provide an array of holiday assistance programs. In the next few days, the society will hold parties for needy families at 30 locations across the city. By Christmas Eve, it will distribute turkey dinners to feed 40,000 children and parents. The society hopes to give out 200,000 gifts of toys, games, winter coats, boots, scarves and hats to children who might otherwise receive nothing.
Readers who need help or know of a family that needs help can call the Children's Aid Society this week, until noon on Christmas, at (212) 949-4800 or 949-4921, and the agency's staff will try to arrange for food or gifts for children who would otherwise be left out.
The Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, another fund beneficiary, is buying and delivering toys to 125 organizations that serve poor children. The Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, also a fund beneficiary, is running winter clothing and blanket drives.
The Neediest Cases Fund charities help desperate families every month of the year. During the holidays, they provide a rare measure of happiness to children who have the least. Contributions are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Checks should be made payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and mailed to P.O. Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087.

HEADLINE: Jobs for the Mentally Ill

 BODY:

To the Editor:
If only more companies would discover the value of employing people with mental illnesses, as described in "A Chance for People With Mental Disorders" (Earning It, Nov. 23). 
 Imagine a world where a psychiatric diagnosis no longer stands between an individual and a job. The fact is that with the availability of effective present-day treatments,most individuals with brain disorders can work.
And yet, a recent survey commissioned by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, involving 1,300 people, revealed that one in three individuals with severe mental illnesses had been turned down for a job for which they were qualified because of a psychiatric label.
While this country enjoys unprecedented economic prosperity and record-low unemployment rates, 85 percent to 90 percent of people with severe mental illnesses are without jobs.
Companies like Ben & Jerry's Homemade and Carolina Fine Snacks didn't need a law to persuade them to do the right thing. Their commitment to hiring employees with mental illness was motivated by good business practices.

SOUTH KOREA
A President and a Problem
South Koreans swept out the political establishment and elected as president a campaigner for democracy whom past dictators tried to kill. But the new President, Kim Dae Jung, may feel some of the apprehension that goes along with answered prayers. True, he is a legendary figure, a Lech Walesa of Korea, and his victory immediately made history, since it was the first time an opposition candidate was ever elected president in the country. But he immediately steps into severe economic turmoil. He plans a quick trip to the United States -- Wall Street, to be precise -- and promised to open Korean markets, usher in a free-market economy and abide by the austerity demanded under a rescue plan from the International Monetary Fund. 

THE WON'S FALL
A Shaken Middle Class
The Korean currency resumed its free fall after the election, ending a week of rocky swings. Korean stocks also plunged, on worries about how the economy will fare under the I.M.F.'s guidelines. Ordinary people are worried, too. Many Koreans worked their way from peasantry to the middle class in a generation. But now they are beginning to learn what it means to be unemployed. Kim Kyoung Ae, who lost her job at a telephone assembly plant that closed, said, "when I go to the unemployment office, they treat me like a beggar."
 
JAPAN
Stimulus, Anyone?
While anxious Asians debated whether Japan, with its giant economy and political disarray, was part of the solution or part of the problem, Tokyo switched gears and urgently cobbled together a program to foster growth. With the economy hovering on the brink of recession, the Government had been criticized for its austere policies, but even with the reversal, economists questioned whether the public spending and tax cuts were big enough. Temporary tax cuts would save a typical family about $300 a year, but the frugal Japanese might salt that away instead of spending it and stimulating the economy.
 
WALL STREET
Catching a Flu
Wall Street's relative immunity to Asia's troubles was pierced, with stocks sinking for a second week. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged almost 270 points on Friday, before recovering some lost ground and closing at 7,756.29, down 90.21 points for the day, on extremely heavy volume. The latest plunge followed steep declines in Japan and Korea. Profit worries also hurt American companies. The declines brought the Dow well below its record close of 8,259.31, on Aug. 6.
 
PRIVACY
Unlisted, or Perhaps Not
Big companies that amass reams of intimate personal data -- from Social Security numbers to unlisted telephone numbers -- agreed to limit access to that information in the fast-growing marketplace on the Internet -- but only if you say "Please." That is, people can opt out by going to the trouble of asking the companies to withhold personal data about them. The 14 companies in the agreement represent 90 percent of the market, and include three of the biggest credit-reporting companies. Civil liberties groups and privacy advocates found the deal inadequate, but the head of the Federal Trade Commission, Robert Pitofsky, said, "Self-regulation ought to be given a chance." Last year, Nexis-Lexis introduced P Trak, a popular feature that allowed Net users to track down people's birth dates and current and previous addresses.
 
ANTITRUST
Besieging Fortress Microsoft
The software company's prize fight with Washington got more exciting, with the Justice Department accusing the company of making a mockery of an antitrust ruling involving its Internet browser. A court had ordered Microsoft, as a temporary measure, to separate the browser from its Windows 95 operating system, but the Justice Department said Microsoft was responding with clearly unworkable solutions. In bruising language, it said Microsoft was cynically affronting the court and asked for a rare peek at the company's products before their release. The company said it was plain that what the Government "asked for doesn't work." But Microsoft is also under examination by the top legal officials in big states; they, too, are looking at its marketing practices. "Microsoft is going to find that it is looking at a shotgun with multiple barrels," one lawyer representing competitors said.
 
CONSUMER ELECTRONICS
The Retail Blues
It was the week before Christmas, and New York's biggest consumer electronics retailer was not enjoying the season. Ultrathin profit margins and sagging demand pushed the Wiz Inc. into bankruptcy protection. The chain expanded fast and built up debt. But besides the company's particular problems, the whole consumer electronics business is one of the grimmest segments of the retail landscape. Not only are margins low, but shoppers are slow to replace their televisions and stereos, and there are few hot, innovative products. And now another wave of price-cutting is predicted, as companies fight just to stay in business.
 
ORGANIC FOOD
Now, About That Label . . .
Washington proposed rules for regulating the rapidly growing organic food industry, now a $3 billion-a-year business. The lack of standards in the past allowed almost any producer to slap a label on a product and call it organic.
 
CLEAN FUEL
Ford Joins the Cavalcade
The Ford Motor Company joined a venture that is working to develop cleaner, more efficient vehicles powered by fuel cells. With no moving parts, fuel cells produce electricity through an electrochemical process, and they produce little exhaust other than water. The $420 million project, in conjunction with Daimler-Benz of Germany and Ballard Power Systems of Vancouver, British Columbia, is aiming to develop a commercial fuel cell by 2004.
 
TELECOMMUTING
On-the-Job Training
Corporations are getting used to telecommuting, and are even training workers how to do it. At Merrill Lynch, a lab teaches people to work at home the Merrill Lynch way. That means everything from regular work hours to a company-approved chair. Michele Jurkouich, a systems analyst who is going to work at home two days a week to be near her 10-month-old child, is first going through four months of applications, interviews and formal training about how telecommuting should, and should not, be done. Cities like Tacoma, Wash., and Tampa, Fla., have watched home businesses grow, and somehow the word "tax" came to mind. Polly Rumbough, Tampa's occupational licensing official, said, "We are taxing, not regulating." Tampa gets about $8 million a year from home-based businesses and professionals.

HEADLINE: Caribbean Nations, Ignoring U.S., Warm to Cuba

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: KINGSTON, Jamaica, Dec. 20

 BODY:
After nearly 15 years of American-induced separation, Cuba and the English-speaking countries of the Caribbean are moving rapidly to reactivate their relations. Thanks to that effort, Elvis Lopez Calderon, a 32-year-old Cuban mathematics teacher, has a new job here.
Mr. Lopez is one of 19 Cubans who arrived here last month to spend two years teaching in Jamaican schools. Their presence was made possible by several trade and technical agreements that Jamaica and Cuba signed when Prime Minister P. J. Patterson visited Havana in June, and it recalls similar Cuba-Jamaica exchanges in the 1970's that incurred Washington's wrath. 
 In those days, of course, programs to bring Cuban doctors here or send Jamaican students to Havana were seen in the context of the cold war and the eagerness of Michael Manley, who was then Prime Minister, to build third world alliances. But Jamaicans in and out of government argue that times have changed and that the policy of the English-speaking Caribbean needs to change too.
"Communism has broken down and represents no threat to us in the region," said Dr. Claude M. Packer, director of Mico Teachers College, where Mr. Lopez is teaching calculus. "That era is gone, and since we are their neighbor, only 90 miles away, we think there can be collaboration and cultural exchange that works both ways."
With that notion firmly implanted here, Jamaica, the largest English-speaking nation in the Caribbean, is once again leading efforts to reach out to Cuba. Jamaican policy, like that of a growing number of Caribbean countries, is one of "deepening the collaborative ties between our Governments and peoples," said the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Seymour Mullings, recently.
Several Caribbean nations, including Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago, first established diplomatic ties with Cuba a quarter of a century ago, defying Washington's policy of political and commercial isolation. But after the United States and countries of the eastern Caribbean invaded Grenada in October 1983 to put an end to Cuban influence there, those relationships cooled.
Besides Mr. Patterson, who is currently chairman of the Caribbean Community, or Caricom, Prime Minister Keith Mitchell of Grenada and Prime Minister James F. Mitchell of St. Vincent and the Grenadines have also traveled to Cuba this year. This month, Billie Miller, the Foreign Minister of Barbados, the country from which the 1983 invasion of Grenada was mounted, also paid an official visit to Havana.
"We have to be able to strike strategic relationships with those who are willing to help us in charting a course of serious development as we confront the 21st century," Keith Mitchell said in an interview earlier this year. "When we look back at our relationship with Cuba, I think most Grenadians of all ages and groups agree that, over all, the Cuban role and presence here was positive."
As a result of the increased contacts, Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, has been invited to attend a Caricom summit meeting in Grenada early next year. Cuba recently opened an embassy in Trinidad, and Mr. Castro may also visit Jamaica sometime in 1998, diplomats said.
In addition, a Caricom delegation met with Cuban officials in Havana this month to discuss such matters as trade, investment, maritime links and bilateral projects. The meeting followed Caricom's earlier endorsement of Cuba's effort to gain eligibility for European trade benefits that the rest of the Caribbean already enjoys.
At the beginning of the decade, trade between Caricom and Cuba was barely $5 million. That figure has since grown tenfold, and is expected to increase further as the Cuban economy gradually opens to foreign investment and four Chinese-style special economic zones begin operations.
Officials from several countries said that Cuba's emergence as a tourist destination in recent years had been an equally important factor in their decision to expand ties. Air Jamaica, for instance, now flies to Havana three times a week from its hub in Montego Bay, and the Superclubs group, a leading Jamaican resort chain, manages half a dozen hotels in Cuba.
"They have already opened up, and once the Castro era ends, they will open up even further," said one Caribbean country's tourism minister, who did not want to be identified. "It is important that we establish links now," he said, in order to develop multiple destination package tours and prevent throat-cutting competition.
Although the English-speaking Caribbean countries are taking the lead in renewing links with Havana, they are by no means alone in the effort. Last year, Haiti re-established diplomatic ties, which were ended during the Duvalier dictatorship. And on Dec. 10, the Dominican Republic appointed its first consul to be stationed in Havana since it broke relations with Cuba 33 years ago.
Thus far, the Clinton Administration has responded with restraint to the region's warming relations with Cuba. Senior officials from several Caribbean countries said they discussed the issue with Mr. Clinton at a regional summit meeting in Barbados in May, arguing that Cuba should be integrated into regional groups, including the Organization of American States, and held to standards of conduct on human rights and a market economy that membership would require.
Cuba has already joined the 34-member Association of Caribbean States, which includes every country in the Caribbean basin except the United States. The organization has publicly committed itself to creating a Caribbean free-trade area by the start of the new century that would include all its members, though negotiations have lagged.
This summer, however, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American Republican from Miami who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade, introduced legislation that would prohibit increases in American foreign aid or trade benefits to any Caribbean or Central American country that supports Cuba's entry into the Caribbean Community or any regional free-trade pact.
"For the Castro regime to be afforded such privileges defies and violates the democratic beliefs and free market principles that the free nations of the hemisphere have pledged to uphold," Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said in August. "The U.S. should not be contributing to this."
Former President Jimmy Carter, who was here this week to monitor parliamentary elections, disagreed. "This is one more example of the total stupidity of American policy toward Cuba," he said.
But the reality is that the United States contributes little and thus has less leverage over the Caribbean than before. Congress has repeatedly failed to approve legislation that would allow members of Caricom to enjoy the same trade benefits as Mexico, and the Clinton Administration has dramatically cut, rather than increased, economic and technical aid to the region.
Caribbean leaders acknowledge that their relationship with the United States remains far more important than burgeoning ties with Cuba and that they would not take any steps that might invite American reprisals. But they remain opposed to Washington's policy of isolation, the economic embargo in particular, and seem determined to forge ahead with efforts to bring Cuba into the fold.
"We did not make Cuba a Caribbean country," Prime Minister Patterson told reporters earlier this year. "God and nature so ordained."
At a news conference on Friday, he added, "As members of Caricom, we insist that in accordance with our sovereign rights we have the capacity to determine with whom we trade and on what terms."

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Counters Pessimism on '98 Growth

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Asia's financial crisis threatens to dampen global growth, but there is no reason to be overly pessimistic, the International Monetary Fund said today.
It said overall world output would grow by a buoyant 3.5 percent next year, although that is eight-tenths of a percentage point below its October forecast, and six-tenths below this year's estimated performance. 
 "The threat to global growth from the present crisis is reasonably limited," the report said.
But Asia is another matter. "A sharp slowdown is an unavoidable consequence of the type of crisis affecting a number of the Asian economies," it said.
The fund has put together an international bailout for Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea totaling $100 billion. The bailouts are attached to demands for economic restructuring. But the fund said North America and Europe look "well sustained" for the year ahead.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Warming To the Government It Ignored for Years

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
A far-off speck on a map, the nation's capital always seemed irrelevant to William H. Gates and his prodigies at Microsoft as they reaped billions of dollars and conquered the software industry from their outpost in Redmond, Wash.
The Microsoft Corporation, which grew up without regulation, and the Federal Government have mostly steered clear of each other. The company played the game its own way. It contributed a pittance to political coffers and lobbied only sporadically, with cocky self-assurance, on a narrow set of issues. And there were few consequences. 
 But as technology becomes an increasingly dominant force in the economy and in people's homes, Microsoft is beginning to bump up against the Government like a toy car crashing into a living room wall.
Embroiled in a showdown with the Justice Department over its potential control of the Internet, Microsoft is dusting off the standard corporate playbook for the first time in its short history. Washington, company officials are beginning to realize, dislikes a cold shoulder.
And when Microsoft decides to get into something, be it the Internet, which it virtually ignored until late 1995, or the Washington power game, which it virtually ignored until this fall, there is no mistaking the company's determination to win. "Microsoft completely understands how important public policy is to the software industry," said Mark Murray, the company's spokesman.
In the last few months, Microsoft, which had $11.4 billion in revenue last year, has hired teams of intrepid lobbyists and public relations experts known for their cozy ties to Washington leaders. They include Vin Weber, a former Republican Representative from Minnesota and a friend of Speaker Newt Gingrich, and Edelman Public Relations Worldwide, which is on retainer along with Downey Chandler Inc. That lobbying firm is headed by two former powerful members of the House: Rod Chandler of Washington, a Republican, and Thomas Downey of New York, a Democrat.
Corporate officials have also been busy, handing out background papers and placing courtesy calls to long-neglected members of Congressional committees and the delegation from its home state.
There have also been mea culpas. By neglecting Washington, Mr. Murray acknowledged this week, Microsoft permitted competitors to whisper -- without hindrance -- in the ears of policy makers.
"Over the past year, our competitors have been calling all over Washington trying to generate anti-Microsoft activity," Mr. Murray said. "We've recognized, perhaps belatedly, that we need to make sure that policy makers hear both sides of the story."
In only two months, Microsoft has suffered a series of setbacks. And in the last couple of weeks, the company's shares have stumbled along with the rest of the technology sector. On Friday, shares of Microsoft closed at $128.5625, down nearly 15 percent from its 52-week high.
But Microsoft has plenty of practice in dealing with investors. It has done less to prepare itself to deal with Washington's phalanx of lawyers and Congressional committees.
Its Washington battles began in earnest in October when Attorney General Janet Reno filed suit, contending that Microsoft violated an earlier court order by forcing computer makers to install its Internet browser software along with its Windows 95 operating system.
On Dec. 11, a Federal judge issued a temporary ruling ordering Microsoft to stop that practice and, more broadly, questioning the company's contention that it alone should determine what software should be considered an integral part of its operating system. Then on Wednesday, the Justice Department tightened the screws and asked the court to hold Microsoft in contempt, accusing the company of making a flat-out mockery of the order.
Microsoft maintained it would be impossible to carry out the order without crippling the operating system. To comply, the company told computer makers that they had three choices: a two-year-old version of Windows; a current version disabled by the removal of the browser, or the full version with Explorer.
Several state attorneys general are also discussing how they may pursue antitrust cases.
Microsoft faced another unflattering scene in November when Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, decided to hold hearings about competition on the Internet. To Microsoft's bewilderment, several witnesses skewered the company, accusing it of possibly violating antitrust laws and playing dirty. (Mr. Hatch's state is the home base of Novell Inc., a Microsoft rival.)
But it was Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, who took sharpest aim at the company's business practices and its reputation for using bullying tactics. In November, he decided to convene a conference on the software business. Not surprisingly, the spotlight was on Microsoft.
The company, sensing an onslaught, fought back. It held a dueling conference and stationed people in the hotel lobby to pass out anti-Nader pins.
Mr. Nader has made his concerns clear: Microsoft's increasingly vast reach into other spheres -- publishing, banking, cable television and travel -- should be closely monitored. "This is a company whose strategy is to become a tollgate collector at every toll and a choke point at every juncture," he said.
Back in Redmond, Microsoft officials say, with evident frustration, that the company has fallen prey to an orchestrated smear campaign.
"Part of the problem may be that some of these issues are extremely technical, and we have not done a good job of explaining them to Federal officials and the court," said Mr. Murray, the spokesman.
Next year could prove even tougher, politically, for the company. Besides more hearings scheduled by Senator Hatch, a court-appointed special master will be looking for further evidence in the browser case, and the Federal judge will make his final ruling.
"This is the beginning of a very long PR battle," said Rob Nichols, the press secretary for Representative Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington.
Many in the capital wonder why it took the company so long to appreciate the importance of extending a friendly hand to Washington.
"You can only get hit in the head with a two-by-four so many times until you realize you have to deal with it," said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan group that studies lobbying and campaign finance.
It was only three years ago that Microsoft opened a lobbying office in Washington, Mr. Murray said. And it had a staff of one. Today, Microsoft has three lobbyists in Washington, although the company contracts work to outside lobbying groups.
"Microsoft's Achilles' heel is their Government operation," said Connie J. Correll, the press secretary for Representative Rick White, the Republican who presides over Microsoft's district.
Compared with many Fortune 500 companies, Microsoft has offered the equivalent of pennies in political contributions: $35,000 in soft-money contributions from January through November of this year, the bulk of it for Republicans, and $23,498 to candidates of both parties. Its political action committee contributed $9,000 in the same period.
So far this year, the Philip Morris Companies, the tobacco giant, has contributed $231,221 in PAC money alone, and far more to the parties and candidates.
Microsoft, however, has not snubbed Washington entirely. It has lobbied successfully on issues directly affecting it, including encryption and Internet taxes.
But now the stakes are higher.
Decency on the Internet, encryption and antitrust matters have all piqued lawmakers' interest.
As Microsoft gears up for next year, some Washington power brokers wonder whether the company will genuinely shake off its aloof posture or simply throw money at the issues that matter most to its future.
"They are hiring big guns and blundering at the same time," Mr. Nader said, echoing a widely held opinion among some industry leaders and Capitol Hill lawmakers.
The company's response this week to the Justice Department action -- impolitic and condescending, some say -- is a a case in point.
"From a legal standpoint, there is no justification for that position," said Mr. Murray, reiterating Microsoft's stance. "We have not been able to get that message across. And the issues are very, very technical and very intangible. You cannot look at software code in the same way you look at a car or tank of gas."
One senior Republican staff member of the Judiciary Committee said that attitude could make Microsoft more enemies than friends.
"You look at their approach to this case, it's fairly contemptuous to the Government," the aide said. "It's like 'What on earth are you guys doing meddling with us' and that has been their approach to Washington. Swatting at gnats."

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe Faces Showdown On Unfinished Issue of Land

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: BURMA VALLEY, Zimbabwe

 BODY:
Hermanus Vorster, whose ancestors trekked over the Vumba Mountains into this valley in 1918, fumbled through the boxes in his small office and produced the deed by which his great-grandfather bought Gwindingwi Farm in 1920. It is stamped with the ornate crest of the British South Africa Company and has a hand-drawn sketch of the hills on it, inked in faint browns and greens.
His family lost the land once, but he bought most of it back in 1985. The patch where his great-grandfather, grandfather and father are buried is now on a neighbor's land. He would like that back as well, but he has a greater worry. He may soon lose it all. Not his 12 trucks and 30 tractors, his miles of irrigation pipe, his new reservoir or his crops of bananas, tobacco and pineapples -- but the land itself, which makes all the rest possible. And he will not be paid for it. 
 After 17 years in office and in serious political trouble, President Robert Mugabe is trying to make good on his promise to give his people land. He will seize it without compensation, he says, since whites stole it on their arrival 107 years ago and still hold 70 percent of the best land nearly two decades after white rule ended. Britain rebuffed his suggestion that as the colonizer of the former Rhodesia it reimburse white farmers. Now Mr. Mugabe wants the United States to do so.
That seems highly unlikely, and a showdown is coming between the farmers and the President.
"It's like the doctor telling you you've got cancer -- you don't know what your future is," Mr. Vorster said, plumping down discouraged on the edge of a desk, the beads of dew on his beer mirroring those on his forehead in the evening heat. If the Government takes everything, he and his wife and two sons "will go be loggers in Brazil or go to Australia and cart their sheep around or something."
If the Government takes Mr. Vorster's farm, it will lose the $100,000 he pays in taxes each year. His farm has 300 live-in employees with hundreds more dependents, and his bananas alone, he estimates, support 500 street hawkers. Asked what would become of them, he shrugged his large shoulders and said, "The Government says that's their problem, not mine."
For years, the President has been pilloried in editorial cartoons that show him aging from a revolutionary waving an AK-47 to a President waving a cane, each time ritually shouting, "I will give you land!" The country has grown cynical. In the past, when white farmers' leases on Government land were terminated, the poor rarely benefited. The best farms went to Cabinet ministers or became weekend bungalows for the party elite.
And land is hardly a cure-all. As in nearby South Africa, the landless want jobs more than they want cornfields. In a recent survey by Mr. Mugabe's Ministry of Social Welfare, only 2 percent of the 18,000 people polled said poverty would be solved by distributing land.
But Mr. Mugabe has big political problems. He is not up for re-election, but there are deep rifts in his party over corruption accusations, and some in the party have also complained about delays in land reform.
At the last Heroes Day -- which commemorates the struggle that led to a black majority Government in 1980 -- the unheard-of happened: the President was shouted down by his core constituency, former guerrillas he led, and was forced to promise them large pensions.
Since the looted state treasury lacked the $280 million required, he abruptly raised the sales tax to 17.5 percent and the income tax to 44 percent and doubled taxes on electricity. That infuriated another constituency, the civil servants.
 On Dec. 10, after a nationwide strike and riots in the capital, the Government scrapped the tax increases, leaving it unclear where the money for the pensions will come from.
The World Bank and International Monetary Fund have suspended aid because Government spending is out of control, and Mr. Mugabe, who has taken 21 trips abroad this year, is accused of ignoring his own people.
So he has revived a familiar theme he has raised before in troubled times -- attacking white farmers as selfish, and threatening to give their land to the poor. But this time he seems to mean it. On Nov. 28, the Government identified 1,503 farms it will seize. The owners were given 30 days to file objections.
The Commercial Farmers Union, most of whose 4,500 members are white, says the 13.6 million acres on those farms amount to nearly half the country's commercial farmland. Given the importance of agriculture here, that is the equivalent of giving not just Manhattan but nearly half of America's cities back to the Indians.
Whites, who are less than 2 percent of the population of 11 million, have never shown much interest in black empowerment schemes like those popular in South Africa now, under which black individuals and unions are sold shares in corporations at a discount. Instead, having lost political power in 1980, whites have hunkered down beneath Mr. Mugabe's repeated assaults, keeping to themselves and hoping times will improve.
They acknowledge that the current distribution of land is unfair, but point out that some farms are always up for sale and say they are willing to help black farmers under a plan they call Team Zimbabwe.
Many whites abandoned the country during the liberation war, and the ones who stuck it out now feel betrayed. The "indigenization" campaign particularly rankles third-generation family farmers like Mr. Vorster and David W. Hasluck, executive director of the farmers' union.
"We don't like being called 'children of the British,' " Mr. Hasluck said. "We're Zimbabweans."
Commercial farms account for 20 percent of gross domestic product and employ a quarter of the work force, and many fear economic collapse if they are broken up. Farmers need loans at planting time, and anyone on the list "has a credit rating of zero," a banker said.
Since November, the Zimbabwe dollar has fallen from 9 American cents to 6 cents, and has been as low as 4 cents. The central bank only managed to prop it up by raiding the hard currency bank accounts of Zimbabwean companies -- forcing them to exchange the currency for Zimbabwean dollars -- further eroding confidence in the economy.'
Iden Wetherell, a newspaper columnist who frequently criticizes the Government, called the planned seizure "typical of the arbitrary nature of Mugabe and his cohorts" and predicted economic disaster.
"Who wants to put their money in a country where the President is the chief pillager of private property?" he asked.
Although the Agriculture Ministry had long said it would take abandoned or underused farms first, the list includes many of the best. One belongs to a former "Cattleman of the Year." Ten belong to the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa or the Oppenheimer family, which controls it. One belongs to Ian Smith, the country's last white President, another to the anti-apartheid novelist Doris Lessing. Interestingly, 80 belong to large-scale black farmers, who have protested to the governing party's Politburo.
No farm belonging to a high Government official is on the list. But a white-owned one near Mr. Mugabe's country estate -- a farm he has already tried to seize three times -- is.
The Burma Valley farm of Mr. Hasluck is on the list too. On it, dozens of rows of deep green plants sparkling with bright orange peppers stretch to the wooded hills.
"I get three times the crop of farms outside the valley, because there's no frost," he said. On his 3,200 acres he has tobacco-curing barns, herds of healthy cattle and -- like all the Burma Valley farms on the list -- a costly new reservoir and sprinkler system.
About 700 of the 1,503 farms are earmarked not for the poor but for "transfer to indigenous farmers." Without wanting their names used, several farmers said they believed that meant their land would go to "Government officials driving Mercedeses in Harare" who would sell the farms or hire managers and pocket the profits. The Government has dismissed such accusations as the words of a "racist cartel" bent on keeping blacks poor.
There are successful black farmers in Zimbabwe -- about 700 members of the Commercial Farmers Union are black. But it takes money to farm well, and interest rates here are as high as 30 percent. The Government has acknowledged that land given to new owners may be out of production for at least two years. Communal lands are overcrowded, creating an appetite for land, but traditional farming with no room for crop rotation or money for fertilizer wears land out rapidly.
In his capacity as leader of the farmers' union, Mr. Hasluck met with Mr. Mugabe recently.
"I told him, if someone wants to buy my farm, that's fine," he said of the land his family has worked for 50 years. "If I thought it was going to be taken over to resettle the landless poor -- and the people who work for me were taken care of -- I wouldn't mind so much.
"But I said, 'It's not possible that you can just take my farm and give it to a black farmer.' Mugabe told me: 'This is party business. The party has decided.'
Mr. Hasluck continued: "The idea of the Government taking the asset that allows one to survive is something that doesn't amuse me."
Nor are black workers on the farms optimistic.
Patrick Chimbazwa, packing-shed manager on a banana farm listed for seizure, said he and 400 fellow workers feared for their jobs. "They are worried that a black farmer will not have the resources," he said. "They have seen the failures. The last farm I worked on was a black person's. His tractors always had breakdowns, and he did not pay us at the rightful time. If the Government is taking farms based on low productivity, they should take that one."
The Government has no plan, critics say. It has only $5 million earmarked to pay for buildings and irrigation systems -- enough for perhaps 10 farms. It has no money to move thousands of poor families or buy them tools and seed.
Two months ago, Mr. Mugabe told Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain that he expected Britain to compensate white farmers. The British refused, saying the 17-year-old issue was now Zimbabwe's to fix, and land seizure would probably increase poverty. Mr. Mugabe told Mr. Hasluck he was disappointed the Americans had not stepped forward because, he claimed, the United States agreed at the 1979 talks that led to black rule that it would help Britain pay for land redistribution.
A diplomat at the American Embassy in Harare said that there was "no foundation" to suggestions that the United States was obliged to help. The Zimbabwe Government has not approached the Embassy about it, he said.
The Lands and Agriculture Minister, Kumbirai Kangai, said recently that the program would go ahead without outside aid.
"We mean business," he said. "We have reached a stage in our history where the land question has to be addressed."

HEADLINE: Old Antagonisms in a New Race

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
No date has been set for the election. But the race to succeed Floyd H. Flake, the minister who represented southeastern Queens in Congress for a decade, has already evolved into a frenzy, inspiring intense backroom wrangling and resurrecting a political feud more than a decade old.
The special election to replace Mr. Flake, who resigned last month to devote more time to the Queens church where he is pastor, has lured a host of candidates. And they have hired a battery of media consultants, pollsters and advisers for a race that will be waged as much among party insiders as in the streets of the Sixth Congressional District. 
 The three candidates seen as most formidable are members of the State Legislature: Senator Alton R. Waldon Jr., Assemblyman Gregory W. Meeks and Assemblywoman Barbara M. Clark, all Democrats.
The race has already fueled antagonisms dating back 11 years, when Mr. Waldon faced Mr. Flake in a heated special election to represent the district in Congress after the death of Representative Joseph P. Addabbo. Mr. Waldon won that contest, but two months after going to Congress, Mr. Flake defeated him in the Democratic primary and went on to Congress in 1987.
That race produced bitterness between the two officials that many Democratic officials in Queens insist still exists. And now Mr. Flake is endorsing Mr. Meeks, who is seen as Mr. Waldon's major opponent.
Because it is a special election, the candidates who appear on the ballot will be selected by the various political parties, by a vote of their district leaders. The Democratic Party will select its candidate through a vote of about 30 district leaders.
Mr. Waldon, 60, is seeking to position himself as the experienced elder statesman. He describes his years in the State Senate, his preceding tenure in the Assembly and his months in Congress as making him the tested, accomplished choice.
"I have the most experience, by far," Mr. Waldon said. "I have done a lot of things in my life that have prepared me for this. And, let's face it, I've already done the job."
He has hired as his campaign manager William K. Banks, a veteran of the campaigns of former Mayor David N. Dinkins and Representative Edolphus Towns. He has also hired as his media consultants Hank Sheinkopf, a pollster and veteran political consultant. Furthermore, he said, he is looking to raise and spend as much as $600,000 for an election that is expected to occur sometime in February.
While Mr. Waldon is presenting the image of experienced political insider, Mr. Meeks is trying with equal fervor to portray himself as the young, energetic upstart.
"In many ways, I represent the future of the party," said Mr. Meeks, who is 44 and is entering his sixth year in the Assembly. "Al Waldon may think he has the party's designation, but I have a substantial portion of the district leaders, too."
"If the undecideds go with me, then the election is over. The way I look at it, I'm Cassius Clay and he's Sonny Liston."
Mr. Flake said Mr. Meeks's age was an advantage. "Greg Meeks has the greatest chance to stay long enough to build seniority if the Democrats win back the House," he said, adding that Mr. Meeks "had a better understanding of the need to develop economic programs in the district."
Mr. Flake said his endorsement of Mr. Meeks was not motivated by a political feud. He said his relationship with Mr. Waldon had been "a professional one."
"I don't think we're enemies," he said.
Mr. Meeks has retained as his media adviser Hank Morris, the political strategist who has worked on a number of Democratic campaigns.
For her part, Ms. Clark, 58, said she had been busy meeting with district leaders, although she declined to say how many have pledged to support her candidacy.
"I'm campaigning. I'm raising money and I have a committee," said Ms. Clark, an 11-year veteran of the Assembly. "I don't know exactly how the prospects are lining up. But I see myself as being as competitive as any other candidate."
The district includes neighborhoods in southeastern Queens, stretching from Jamaica, South Ozone Park, Springfield Gardens and Hollis to portions of the Rockaway peninsula. With a 1990 population that was 22 percent white, 16 percent Hispanic, 6 percent Asian and 53 percent black, it is home to one of the city's largest black middle-class areas.
Because the district is heavily Democratic, the candidates have been scrambling to line up support among that party's district leaders. Not a day goes by, say most district leaders, when they are not the objects of an intensely competitive courtship.
"I am being lobbied on a very, very regular basis," said Juanita E. Watkins, a City Councilwoman who is also a Democratic district leader. "At this point, I have not yet made a decision. And, after all, there is still time."
But there is not likely to be much time. Mr. Flake's resignation took effect Nov. 15, and, under state law, the special election must occur between 30 and 45 days after the seat is declared vacant by the Governor. So far, Gov. George E. Pataki has made no such declaration.
None of the candidates are wasting any time. At a recent holiday party given by the Queens Democratic Party, all three were on hand, in different corners of the room, buttonholing various district leaders and making it clear that the campaign was in full swing.
While Mr. Waldon may have the backing of several prominent Queens politicians and ministers, Mr. Meeks's support is seen as equally formidable. The Assemblyman has been endorsed by both the Rev. Al Sharpton and Mr. Flake, who leads the 8,600-member Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church, half of whose members live in the district. Mr. Meeks said that, like Mr. Waldon, he is being endorsed by several prominent Queens clergymen.
Adding to the sense of free-for-all politics is the fact that the Democratic chairman of Queens, Representative Thomas J. Manton, has declined to state a preference.
"I don't have any intention of making an endorsement," Mr. Manton said. "I'd like to see the process be as open as possible."
Meanwhile, State Senator Serphin R. Maltese, the Queens Republican leader, said his party is planning to be competitive, even though the district has been in Democratic control for decades.
Alfonso C. Stabile, a Republican City Councilman, said he was seriously considering running.
Still, most Queens officials say that the candidate selected by the Democrats will be best positioned to win the special election. Mr. Meeks has made it clear that he will seek another party's endorsement if he is not selected by the Democrats.
"There's no way to know how this will turn out," said Mr. Manton, the Democratic leader. "A lot can happen. But at the moment, what we have is maneuvering, ad infinitum."

HEADLINE: Wiz Is Latest Chain to Fall In Tough Electronics Market

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
When the Wiz Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection last week, it represented the ninth time in recent years that a high-profile consumer electronics chain in New York City had been zapped by a combination of market forces and human errors.
Trader Horn, Newmark & Lewis, Crazy Eddie, Save Mart, Vim, 47th Street Photo, Brick Church, Incredible Universe -- all of them sold high-tech gizmos and gadgets and all faded from the local retailing landscape. 
 "It's a very tough business, and these businesses fail for several reasons," said Kurt Barnard of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, a trade newsletter. "Cutthroat competition, product saturation, overexpansion, changes in the way products are sold, and in some cases, like Crazy Eddie, they were crooked."
Sometimes, too, it is inept management or, as was the case for Incredible Universe, a failed concept. "It was too big; people were overwhelmed," said Bob Gerson, the editor in chief of TWICE (This Week in Consumer Electronics), a trade newspaper.
Thus far, for the Wiz, the largest consumer electronics retailer in the New York metropolitan region, known for its ubiquitous "Nobody Beats the Wiz" advertisements, the official cause of death -- or near-death, as all but 17 of its 52 stores will remain open through the company's reorganization in bankruptcy -- was an expensive expansion into New England over the last three years, compounded by complications like declining prices and a generous policy on returns.
Why is expansion so perilous for retailers? After all, Newmark & Lewis and Crazy Eddie perished after following a similar course. Sometimes, it is desperation to increase sales in the face of shrinking margins. Sometimes, it is simple ambition.
In the case of the Jemal family, which controls the privately owned Wiz, the expansion saddled the company with debt that was increasingly difficult to service as prices for many items fell and sales stagnated.
"The entire consumer electronics industry has been struggling because of price deflation," said Peter Caruso, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.
He added that sales have been flat or have fallen at many stores because there has been no release of a wildly successful new product in years; the industry is pinning its comeback hopes on high-definition television and digital video disks.
Not even the recent boom in computers could help the Wiz much, Mr. Caruso said, since many are purchased directly from manufacturers, like Dell and Gateway, or through mail order or the Internet, where products are often discounted.
Sandy Bloomberg, chief executive officer and founder of New England Audio, which owns 23 Tweeter Etc. stores in New England and 18 Bryn Mawr Audio and Video stores in the Philadelphia area, agreed that falling prices had been a persistent problem in recent years for all consumer electronics chains. He noted that many major department stores, including Macy's, Federated and Filene's, were leaving the consumer electronics business, a notable exception being Sears.
"A 35-inch TV that was $1,500 six years ago is now $799," Mr. Bloomberg said. "A camcorder has come down 35 percent in the same period, a VCR 25 percent. What this means is that you have to sell more units each year to make up for the lower prices and the smaller margins."
Mr. Gerson said: "It's getting like supermarkets, the margins are so slim. You can get a VCR for $100. So you've got to have volume and you've got to have management."
Circuit City, the nationwide chain, recently opened two stores in New York City, and Best Buy is expected to open stores next year. Both are viewed as better managed with a more diversified product line than the Wiz and other consumer electronics stores. For example, Circuit City sells appliances as well as stereos and televisions, and appliances have higher margins and suffer less from price deflation.
Mr. Bloomberg added that Circuit City would not have the huge advertising cost, per customer, that the Wiz had because it could advertise nationally rather than only in selected markets. He said the Wiz spent "well beyond what was logical" on advertising. "In New York, you get a problem with egos," he said. "They think big, and if you don't think with your head then it can get you into trouble."
But analysts say that the Wiz's filing for Chapter 11 was not solely a New York phenomenon. "The struggles of companies like the Wiz are more closely related to industry trends than to the New York market itself," said Stewart Cohen, chief executive of Paragon Capital L.L.C., a Newton, Mass., lender to retailers that recently worked with the Wiz.
Mr. Bloomberg said that many of the large chain stores like the Wiz did well, at least initially, thanks to unsophisticated first-time buyers, but that even those customers had become more sophisticated in recent years.
"The consumer every year raises the bar -- the consumer is now much more empowered than it used to be," he said. "It used to be that they would accept poor service for low price or pay high price for good service. Now, they want a higher level of service and will not pay more for it."
And though it has been little publicized, returns appear to have been another factor in the demise of stores like the Wiz. "Most retailers are cutting back on their return policies," said Walter F. Loeb, senior retail senior analyst with Loeb Associates, a retail consulting firm and publisher of the Loeb Retail Letter.
Indeed, it was not unheard of for customers seeking, say, a video camera for a wedding or vacation to buy one at the Wiz and then return it a week or two later for a full refund. The stores then are often forced to resell the item at a discount because it is in an open box.
"People are now looking at that as one of the major problems that has ensued in the industry," Mr. Loeb said, "particularly in New York City, where people take advantage of everything."
Saul E. Burian, a lawyer representing the Wiz in the bankruptcy proceedings, said that the store would keep its liberal policy of allowing returns within 33 days of purchase on many items, except, perhaps, at stores that were closing and were holding close-out sales. He also said that all warranties on products bought at all the stores would be honored, as would its own credit card. "The court ordered that we can fully respect all customer obligations," he said.
Why does the Wiz think it fell on hard times?
"A variety of reasons," Mr. Burian said. "A general softness in the industry, no new product to generate sales, competition, saturation, an expansion program.
"It was a cruel combination."

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
Jordan's Responsibility? Moving Fans and Moving Merchandise

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
I like Mike. It's nothing personal. I don't know the name of Michael Jordan's wife, how many children they have, whom he voted for in the last election (if indeed he did) and the role that religion plays in his life. I also don't care.
I do know that I would pay to see him play most any kind of game and that if I thought it would make me more like him I would even wear his sneakers and cologne. He is one of the most appealing entertainers in the world and one of the best-looking people; he deserves to be the highest-paid male model. 
 But does Jordan, who made one of his scheduled state visits yesterday and scored 24 points in a 100-92 victory over the Nets, have any more responsibility than staying in practice and looking good? I don't believe he does, and I don't want him to be a model of anything more than great performances and unnecessary consumer goods. That is why I'm troubled by the mounting criticism of his lack of social concern.
It's a distant drumbeat at the moment, but it will grow louder as the movement against Nike gains momentum and as Jordan comes to the end of his playing career. Jordan's carefully cultivated image as a charmer and company man, the antithesis of Latrell Sprewell, may not survive a looming contract war between the National Basketball Association and its labor pool.
If he sides with labor, he will lose the public relations machines and be more vulnerable to replacement by a younger, hungrier player (the "new Michael Jordan"). If he sides with management, he will be further exposed as the "moral jellyfish" of a smart screed in The Los Angeles Times by Dave Meggysey, Western director of the National Football League Players Association.
He is absolutely right about Michael's being a moral jellyfish for allowing his signature sports gear to be made by sweatshop labor. But the larger premise is wrong. As a former pro football linebacker with splendid progressive credentials, Meggysey shares not only the jock superiority complex but also a belief in the athlete's responsibility to be a model citizen.
I don't share that belief at all. I do not want Michael Jordan telling children how to conduct their lives -- even if he happens to be right -- any more than I want Sprewell or Coach Tom Osborne giving moral lectures. It is only through the moral laziness of parents, commentators and youth counselors and the greed of television and corporate executives that ordinary people with extraordinary talents become "role models." It doesn't just happen.
Asking Jordan to use his swooshy pulpit for worthy causes is buying into the mission of the Celebrated Church of Mutant Morphin Michael Barbies, which is to move units of products. This is a god that will always fail.
Sometimes, the role model turns out to be a human being and sometimes the shipment never arrives. At the annual dinner last week of my all-time favorite team so far, Martin Luther King Jr. High School's city soccer champions, my all-time favorite coach this year, Martin Jacobson, confided that after all the romance from a regional Nike rep, the promised balls, the turtlenecks and the shoes never arrived. Weren't consecutive titles, 38 straight victories, good enough?
That evening's keynote speaker was the spellbinding Doug Logan, the Major League Soccer commissioner and the circuit rider of the futbol sect. Perhaps the most important truth he told the team was that "luck" was as important as hard work and talent in becoming a champion; it was quiet call for humility in an age that does not usually reward it.
Logan easily became my favorite commissioner, even though he had not been invited to last month's "An Evening with the Commissioners" at the Bar Association. Paul Tagliabue of the N.F.L. thoughtfully described "the lynch mob mentality against athletes." It was an unfair open season, he felt. He was alluding to the unfair rush to judgment over the wrongful rape claim against the Dallas Cowboys' Michael Irvin, but his words later resonated through the Sprewell incident.
Meanwhile, at that legal gathering, David Stern, the crowd's perky, smug and very smart pet, waxed most eloquent about "protection of intellectual property," which included keeping control of the dissemination of games and of the image of the N.B.A. By the time Sprewell had acted out and the anti-Jordan boomlet began, one could begin to wonder if that property might be losing value again. Basketball has led the way in merchandising its stars, and when stars fall. . . .
Will soccer save us? The present attractions of the sport here -- the emphasis of finesse over violence, the lack of commercialism, the normal size of its players, the importance of the women's game -- may not survive success.
The game needs a Babe Ruth, an Arnold Palmer, a Michael Jordan, an athlete of overwhelming talent and charisma who is also willing and able to help the global economy move units. Does the new Mike also need to be a moral jellyfish?

HEADLINE: After Seeking Rate Cut, Suffolk Angers Pataki With Lilco Fight

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Dec. 19

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki went out on a limb this year when he pushed for a partial state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company. With Suffolk officials pleading for relief from Lilco's soaring electric rates, he set aside his aversion to big government to strike a deal that he said would be a boon to Long Island, a crucial Republican stronghold.
So it may be no surprise that politicians here say he is furious at the Republican-controlled Suffolk County Legislature, which was skeptical of the complex plan and is now leading the drive to scuttle it. Opponents of the plan say it would bail out Lilco stockholders at an exorbitant cost to electricity customers. 
 "The Governor remains very confident of his plan to cut rates by double digits, protect property owners from massive tax hikes and further stimulate the economy on Long Island," said his spokesman, Michael McKeon. Lilco's rates are the highest in North America.
Now, both sides on the Lilco issue are digging in for a prolonged struggle that will decide the plan's fate. Mr. Pataki's appointees on the state's Long Island Power Authority are pushing hard to get the required regulatory approvals in time to announce rate cuts and send refund checks to electric customers next year -- before the Governor comes up for re-election in November.
The Suffolk Legislature is fighting the plan on several fronts. It recently voted to spend $800,000 for lawyers and other consultants to oppose the plan before the regulatory agencies. The major hurdles are the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
In addition, legislators are considering a suit to block the plan, and their aides are drafting an anti-plan referendum for 1998 to replace the one knocked off last month's ballot by a court challenge.
"We will utilize whatever means possible to stop a deal that has been characterized by national experts as the worst-case scenario," said the chairman of the Suffolk Legislature's Energy and Environment Committee, Michael J. Caracciolo.
Under the Pataki plan, the Power Authority would buy Lilco's power lines, customer services and business office but retain Lilco to run the operation, then open the management role to competitors in later years. Rates would initially drop 17 percent with the postponement of debt repayment and the use of tax-free bonds, with much of the money going toward debts on the never-opened Shoreham nuclear plant.
"We want to get this done as soon as possible so the people of Long Island can get their rates cut," said the Power Authority's chairman, Richard M. Kessel.
But critics like Jack Kulka of the Hauppauge Industrial Association in Suffolk contend that the promised savings are deceptive, that Lilco stockholders would be enriched, that Long Islanders would be saddled with more than $20 billion of debt and that Lilco's monopoly would be locked in for years as the rest of the nation moves to energy deregulation and competition.
Although Long Island has long been united by its disdain for Lilco's high bills, it has now split over Mr. Pataki's proposal. Unlike Suffolk, adjacent Nassau County has no organized opposition to the plan. In fact, the Nassau County Legislature's presiding officer, Bruce A. Blakeman, said officials there were preparing a formal endorsement.
Besides the actions by the Suffolk Legislature, another opposition move was announced on Wednesday by seven Assembly members, led by Paul E. Harenberg, a Democrat. Their bipartisan bill would force Lilco to absorb more Shoreham costs, cut rates and move quickly to energy competition.
On another front, a lawsuit seeking to block the plan claims that state officials failed to make a required environmental review. That case was filed by the New York Public Interest Research Group and the Citizens Advisory Panel, a court-appointed watchdog for Lilco.
Alternative plans have been offered by opposition groups like the Initiative for Competitive Energy and Ratepayers Against Lilco Bailout. But Mr. Kessel, the Power Authority chairman, dismissed their ideas as unworkable, saying that Lilco's agreement to the Pataki plan made it "the only viable solution."
Of all the opposition moves, Suffolk's actions have drawn the most intense interest.
"I have been somewhat surprised by Suffolk, given the fact that it has the most to gain from the proposal and the most to lose if it fails," said Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, the Island's leading business group, which supports the Pataki plan.
Mr. Crosson was referring to a potentially bankrupting court decision ordering local governments in Suffolk to refund $1.2 billion to Lilco customers for excess property taxes imposed for the Shoreham nuclear plant. The Pataki plan would reduce the refund by about half, which critics say shortchanges Nassau residents, and would finance the cost by reducing electric rates slightly less in Suffolk than in Nassau.
But the Suffolk Legislature has come up with its own solution to pay the refund, by authorizing a rise in the state and local sales tax to 8.5 percent, from 8.25 percent. The sponsor, Joseph Rizzo, the County Legislature's presiding officer, estimated that his approach would save $1.8 billion compared with the Pataki plan.
Suffolk's maverick stand comes despite personal pleas over the months from both Governor Pataki and Suffolk's Republican Party chairman, John Powell. County Executive Robert J. Gaffney tries to juggle the issue, supporting the Pataki plan but also saying he respects legislative independence.
"I have no idea why they're doing what they're doing in Suffolk, except they seem to think there is some political gain to be had by it," said John V. N. Klein, a lawyer and former county executive. He represented a developers' group that sued to throw the first referendum off the ballot.
Mr. Crosson noted that Suffolk "has a longer history, a tradition of organized opposition to Lilco," including the environmental advocates who climbed fences to protest the Shoreham plant's construction in Suffolk. Mr. Gaffney and others ran for office on anti-Lilco platforms.
Another factor in Suffolk's opposition is Suffolk Life, a widely distributed weekly newspaper that regularly attacks the Pataki plan.
"It's unfortunate," Mr. Kessel said, "that Suffolk is squandering almost $1 million of taxpayer money to fight rate cuts."

HEADLINE: Figures Show Budget Deficit Fast Shrinking

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
The Government has released figures showing that the Federal budget deficit is falling much faster than official forecasts had reported, providing the first clear evidence that the budget could be balanced in this fiscal year or even show a surplus.
The figures prompted Speaker Newt Gingrich to suggest today that President Clinton speed up the plan to balance the Federal budget. 
 "If the President could come into the State of the Union address and propose a balanced budget by 1999, three years ahead of schedule, we'd be very responsive," Mr. Gingrich said in a telephone interview.
The White House greeted Mr. Gingrich's trial balloon coolly.
"The best way for us to reach a balanced budget sooner than expected is to maintain the fiscal discipline of the last five years, not to spend money we don't have yet," said Gene Sperling, who heads the National Economic Council.
President Clinton is likely to propose some small tax cuts in his budget proposals next month. They include providing incentives to reduce emissions of gases that cause global warming, and possibly tax cuts to promote greater access to child care.
The Administration is still considering how it would deal with the appearance of any large budget surpluses, and officials said that Mr. Clinton might be ready to provide an outline of his philosophy for dealing with such a situation in his State of the Union Message, also next month.
The Administration is not considering any plans for a large tax cut next year.
Though the Government's figures, released on Friday, are only early indicators of the nation's fiscal health, they are sure to intensify planning at the White House and in Congress for what to do if the Government finds itself with money left over at the end of the fiscal year.
The Clinton Administration continues to expect the deficit for the year ending next Sept. 30 to be higher than the $23 billion deficit the Government ran up in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30. Under the schedule laid out in the balanced-budget legislation agreed to by the Administration and the Republican leadership this year, the budget would not be balanced until 2002.
The drive to eliminate the deficit could still be imperiled by any weakening of the economy or a reversal of a surprising surge in tax revenues. But the figures showed that for October and November, the first two months of the current fiscal year, the deficit was $24.4 billion lower than in the same period last year.
If the trend of the first two months continues, analysts said, there could be a big surplus.
Republicans have been pushing for tax cuts and more spending on the military. Democrats are talking about more spending on education and health programs. Lawmakers of both parties are looking at proposals to spend more on highways and at using any surplus to shore up Social Security and Medicare.
Mr. Gingrich said today that his priorities would be to achieve and maintain a balanced budget, then apply up to $30 billion a year toward the national debt. The Speaker said he would favor using any remaining surplus for an annual tax cut and to increase financing for science, transportation and national defense. He said he was still committed to a tax cut next year, staying within the balanced budget framework, by deferring certain spending.
For the first two months of this fiscal year, the Government ran a deficit of $53.3 billion, compared with $77.7 billion in the same period last year, the Treasury Department said. Big deficits in certain times of the year are offset during periods of heavy tax collection, particularly in April and September.
The results reflected both tax revenues that were greater than those in the same period last year and expenditures that were lower.

HEADLINE: Ignoring African Abuses Is No Foreign Policy;
Congo's Progress

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Dec. 16 news analysis of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's Africa tour suggests that Washington's new Africa alliances reflect foreign policies that "eerily mimic those of the past," when cold war imperatives led the United States to support dictatorial regimes. 
 No, history is not repeating itself. It is Ms. Albright's critics who are stuck in the past, trying to impose cold war labels of "undemocratic" or "authoritarian" on governments that are barely consolidated, struggling to reconstruct ruined societies and, to their credit, proclaiming themselves to be transitional.
In Congo, the new Government inherited a state infrastructure so decayed as to be nonexistent -- the legacy of 32 years of Mobutu Sese Seko's corruption. Moreover, remnants of Mr. Mobutu's army and assorted bandits in league with genocidal Hutu militias defeated by the new Government in neighboring Rwanda continue to threaten the security of Congolese citizens.
Despite these conditions, President Laurent Kabila has diversified the political base of both his Government and the army to include members from outside his movement.
The Government has implemented a two-year timetable for constitutional reform and eventual elections, reduced inflation through responsible monetary policies, and made significant strides against corruption.

HEADLINE: The $25 Million Defeat

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: RIDGEWOOD

 BODY:
FOR years, the formula for passing the school budget here each spring has been simple: 1,800 "yes" votes are insurmountable and guarantee victory. On Dec. 2, ritual became myth.
That's when the school board, responding to pointed recommendations of the agency that accredits secondary schools, sought approval of something far more ambitious politically than most budgets: a $25.1 million bond issue to bring the high school -- flagship of one the state's premier school systems -- into the 21st century. 
 Without a new science wing, the latest computers, classroom and library improvements and, at long last, a pool and new gym complex, Ridgewood High School's place as one of the state's best could not be assured, the board felt.
But the bond issue went down with a resounding thud. Instead of the usual low turnout for budget votes -- perhaps 15 to 20 percent -- almost 40 percent of the voters went to the polls and defeated the plan, 3 to 2.
In Ridgewood, as in so many towns across the state, schools are the heart of the community and their health can be tied directly to the willingness of people to pay what in Ridgewood can often be $500,000 to well over $1 million for a house, not to mention steep property taxes.
So what happened on Dec. 2 gave a lot of people pause to consider why such a large number of their friends and neighbors decided not to pay an average of $240 a year more in taxes, and instead vote "no."
Ridgewood isn't alone.
Of 109 school bond issues proposed in the last two years around the state, 55 were defeated, as each community looked into its own soul and its own pocketbook.
People want their schools to be the best, but they don't always agree on how much the best costs or whether they want to spend the money in any case.
What happened in Ridgewood may not be unique, but it provides a window on how towns large and small, rich and poor, confront a basic need: education.
School officials rich and poor, confront a basic need: education.
School officials here were stunned by the breadth of the defeat, 3,535 to almost 2,400: the bond issue lost in all 19 of Ridgewood's election districts.
The turnout of 38 percent of the 15,207 registered voters was an enormous response in this town of 25,000, where even hotly contested budgets tend to pass easily and without so much involvement. Ridgewood has adopted nine of its last 10 budgets, the current one being $49 million.
 The wealthiest residents, who live in lavish older homes tucked into wooded hillsides on the west side of town, offered the most support. But even there the closest contest in the west side's 7 districts was still a 51.7 to 48.3 defeat in District 4.
Elsewhere, the voters' mood was far more sour. About 73 percent said no in a middle-class district, No. 15, east of Benjamin Franklin Middle School and Valley Hospital. And nearly 72 percent said no in a sprawling post-war development of Cape Cod homes in the southeastern part of town known as the Lawns.
 
An Aggressive Campaign To Combat the Board
 At the heart of the defeat was an aggressive, old-fashioned political campaign led by the Ridgewood Taxpayers Association and its president, Sally Brandes. The association blitzed homes with anti-bond fliers and phone calls and ran full-page ads in a local newspaper.
Board officials contended that the ads were full of misrepresentations and wound up spending some of their energy in counter-attack. The opposition campaign was aimed at all residents, particularly middle-class voters, including the elderly, in the election districts where, in the end, the no vote was the most overwhelming.
The board's campaign was more narrowly directed at parents of school children. And allies that it had counted on, including the Home and School Associations in the 9 schools and the Ridgewood Arts Council, ran quieter pro-bond campaigns than originally planned because of legal questions about their roles as vigorous advocates.
After the vote, critics called the school board aloof and presumptuous, contending that officials had not solicited residents' opinions about elements of the bond package during the drafting process.
In response to the vote last week, the superintendent, Dr. Frederick J. Stokley, said that in coming months the district would solicit residents' opinion in a telephone survey, come up with at least three new and scaled-down bond plans and then seek grassroots input on all of them before going before the voters again next September or October.
Besides the complaints about the board's attitude, critics argued that all $25.1 million was earmarked for the high school and nothing was set aside for the two middle schools and six elementary schools. They grumbled that financing $25 million was too expensive: $240 a year for 20 years for a home with the average assessment of $296,000. They focused animosity on the proposed physical education center, particularly its $1.9 million pool.
Advocates praised the pool as the new home of the high school's 40-member swim team, which now practices at 5 A.M. most days at the over-used pool at the local YMCA. They also hailed it as important to the well-being of elementary school children and said all residents could use it weeknights and on weekends.
But the center and the pool became a lightning rod for animosity, with critics denouncing the center as a spa and health club and the pool as superfluous and a luxury. None of the other elements generated as much opposition.
One major advocate, Wendy Schwehm, president of the town-wide Federated Home and School Association, said she had an inkling of trouble ahead when her husband returned from his weekly tennis game one night and said his three playing partners were mad about school taxes and complaining the package was excessive.
"That was the first time I realized there was a problem -- my husband's tennis group," Mrs. Schwehm said. "These are successful guys making good money and they were angry. I was surprised. I'm not sure my husband ever turned them around. I actually offered to go play tennis with them."
Throughout the fall, parties, meetings, and stores in the busy shopping district on East Ridgewood Avenue were abuzz with the pros and cons of the proposed bonds. "It was not a fun time in Ridgewood," said Mrs. Schwehm. Friends and neighbors split on the issue, and even now, nearly three weeks after the vote, some residents refuse to discuss their votes for fear of offending neighbors or colleagues.
Some of Ridgewood's oldest and grandest homes, valued in the high six figures and higher, are in the 4th district, sitting behind towering oaks and aged and sprawling rhododendrons on hilly cul de sacs and narrow roads. In some neighborhoods, the woodlands are countryside dense and blot out a semblance of Ridgewood as bustling suburb.
Robert J. Sommer, a computer salesman, and Thomas Fredericks, a bond trader, are friends and neighbors. Mr. Sommer voted no; Mr. Fredericks yes. Last weekend, they joked about their differences. "We fought in the middle of the road about it," Mr. Fredericks said, laughing.
He called the defeated issue a trial balloon and predicted a more modest version would pass. Of the defeated issue, he said: "You always place a high target and negotiate down to a level more reasonable to everyone." He said he backed the proposal, including the pool and bigger weight room, to keep the school from losing its competitive edge.
He said he believed in a balance between education and athletics, but said education "should be the top priority and focus."
"The money would be better spent on technology and chemistry and math -- that will drive the future and that's where it should be spent."
Like others, Mr. Sommer complained that school officials at one middle school had interrupted class time to show students the board's videotape about the bond and said that helped persuade him and his wife, a teacher, to vote no. He said the proposed bond issue had too much in it.
"We looked at the big lump and said they're trying to put the kitchen sink in there," Mr. Sommer said. "We felt like we were being slam-dunked."
In the southern part of the 4th, Stewart Massey, president of an investment banking company, said he voted yes because his three sons are the fourth generation of his family to attend Ridgewood schools. The benefits for the high school outweighed the cost of the bonds, he said, adding that the town's next two generations of students needed newer and more facilities.
"My kids are going to be playing in the same gym my mother did," he said.
He complained about the "hubris" of school officials and said they had failed to build a consensus for the issue. "This was a vote against the leadership of the school system," he said. "That's a shame because it puts the kids in the middle and that's the wrong place."
Across town, the 15th election district near Benjamin Franklin Middle School is a typical swath of upper middle class suburbia, comfortable two-story homes set on tidy yards. Peggy and Dan McGinley, parents of two elementary-school children and Ridgewood residents for two years, are in the 73 percent majority that voted no.
Mr. McGinley, a securities trader, said he agreed that parts of the high school were old and needed renovation. "But it was a lot of indebtedness to take on," he said. "I'm all for necesssary upgrading, but some things sounded extravagant. I think you've got to let the Board of Education know it doesn't have carte blanche."
Arthur Carpenter, another resident of the 15th, said he had some initial misgivings about the pool but decided to vote yes as he entered the voting booth, partly because three generations of his family, including his four children, had attended the school.
"I said it's a lot of money," he said, "but at today's prices it was something I could afford."
 
Assessing the Defeat: Weariness With Taxes
 In the aftermath, Dr. Stokley, the superintendent, said, without offering detail, that the bond package would be scaled down and that the community would have sufficient input in the drafting process, possibly including a community-wide meeting.
He attributed the defeat to residents' weariness with ever-increasing school taxes and a nationwide distrust of government dating to the Watergate era of the early 1970's.
He complained that because Ridgewood is a wealthy district and qualifies for little state education aid, it must finance 95 percent of its regular school costs with property taxes.
In a statement issued before a board meeeting last Monday, Dr. Stokley appealed for trust:
"The voting public, through information and education, must come to believe and trust that we know what needs to be done and how to do it."
 
Lovely to Look At But Growing Dowdy
 The high school, built in 1919 for $285,000 (after one bond issue failed), sits on a little bluff and is one of Ridgewood's most imposing buildings. Its facade and Gothic spire project an image of distinction, dignity and strength. Many have likened it to a classroom building on an Ivy League campus.
"Psychologically and physically, it's an image you hold of Ridgewood," said Arthur Wrubel, chairman of the town's Historic Preservation Commission. "The architects probably took their cue from people who lived here and their educational and social background."
But the impressive facade belies a cramped interior. There is no auditorium, the only theater seats about 200, the student center is too small to hold an entire class, let alone the entire student body of 1,400. The science wing, built in the 1960's, is outdated, with small classrooms and no water, gas or electricity at some lab stations.
The library seats only 70 students at a time. Art classes are held in the wood shop. Music classes, which enroll a quarter of the student body, are squeezed in here and there. The girls' locker room, circa 1919, is about 40 percent the size of the boys' locker room. Vice Principal Glenn Koegel said it probably violates the Federal law requiring schools and college to offer both sexes equal educational and athletic opportunities. The old gym above the locker, also circa 1919, is tiny, dimly lighted and has an exterior crack from roof to foundation.
In 1990, the Middle States Association of Schools and Colleges praised the education program but said the building needed major renovation to preserve the quality of the program and maintain morale of students and staff.
The proposed bond issue was the board's answer to the Middle States' criticism. The issue's theme: The curriculum had outgrown the building.
Some critics argued that the high school had about 600 more students in 1977 and all did fine. But school officials countered that students took about 5 courses a day then and 7 now. Course offerings, they said, are far broader now and the 21st-century technological demands of colleges and the workplace have become more costly. They also said that increased enrollment in kindergarten through third grade will mean the high school's enrollment would grow by perhaps 200 students 10 years from now.
The campaign produced chilled relations between school officials and Mrs. Brandes, head of the taxpayers association and a former school board member.
The association's campaign against the issue appeared to reach deeper into the community than the school board's efforts to get its messsage out through a videotape, a townwide mailing, meetings in schools, tours of the high school and a pamphlet sent home with elementary school children.
Some residents who said they had never been contacted before a school or local government election said they were called this time and urged to vote no.
After the vote, some officials called Mrs. Brandes and her colleagues chronic complainers who seldom found anything positive about the school system.
Mrs. Brandes, in turn, said school officials had lost touch with the community. She paused outside the district's offices last Monday and said: "This town is a group of professionals. They're not only housed in this building."
During the campaign, the board accused the association of circulating misrepresentations. In its full-page anti-bond newspaper ads, the association made some points about the size of recent increases in school taxes, long-range maintenance plans for all schools, financing repairs and the high school's declining enrollment.
In response, the board president, Michael J. Porro, charged in a letter to a local newspaper that the association's contentions were either incorrect or misleading.
As for arevised proposal, Mrs. Brandes said priorities should include renovating the science wing instead of building a new one, repairing the 1919 gym instead of tearing it down, and expanding the girls' locker room.
"They have to revamp the whole thing and look at the other schools and go after prioritized needs and not extravagant desires," she said. "We are supportive of necessary renovations for all schools and all kids."
 
The Voters Grow Wary
IN the 1990's, schools boards' reliance on long-term bonds to finance new schools or repair old ones has soared around the state, doubling to $3 billion since 1990.
But a recent survey suggests that many voters are becoming wary of adding this debt to their school tax bills. In the first report of its kind in the state, the New Jersey School Boards Association has issued a score card on all school bond referendums in the last two years. Of 109 placed before voters in 1996 and 1997, calling for spending of $1.5 billion, 55 were rejected and 54 approved, the association said.
Association officials said the state's dependence on property taxes to finance schools was most responsible for the rejections.
"New Jersey faces a multibillion-dollar need for new school facilities, and it's clear that local communities cannot foot the bill on their own," said Frank Belluscio, an association spokesman. "Our state needs a broad-based revenue source for school construction."
He said the association favors a cigarette tax to raise the money or a program of grants or revolving loans.
Differing voter responses to the bonds is starkest in Bergen and Monmouth counties. In Bergen, long settled and affluent, with an aging population and older schools, voters rejected 9 of 13 proposed issues in 1996 and 1997. In Monmouth, younger and affluent, and facing pressures from an influx of young families and dwindling school space, voters approved nine of 10 bond plans.
Monmouth County's superintendent, Michael A. Maddaluna, said Monmouth's open countryside is attracting new families eager for good schools, many from Staten Island.
"Monmouth is a desirable place in the eyes of a lot of people," Mr. Maddaluna said. "They're looking for perhaps better education, and they will be supportive."
The eight Monmouth towns that approved bonds ranged across the socio-economic spectrum, from Colts Neck, a wealthy town that approved bonds worth $5.7 million, to middle-class Freehold Borough, which agreed to spend $5.9 million. Two well-to-do communities had Monmouth's biggest successful packages: Middletown Township, $78.4 million, and Freehold Township, $26.9 million.
Some of Bergen's rejections came in both affluent towns -- Ridgewood ($25.1 million), Cresskill ($5.75 million) and Ho-Ho-Kus ($4.99 million) -- and blue collar communities -- Bergenfield ($2.5 million), Ridgefield Park ($5.99 million) and Rochelle Park ($4.5 million.) ROBERT HANLEY

To the Editor:
"Study Shows New York Has Greatest Income Gap" (front page, Dec. 17) points out that stagnation of welfare benefits is one cause for wealth disparity. New York has not raised the welfare basic allowance since 1990, despite a cost-of-living increase of 25 percent. Recipients struggle to survive, which detracts from efforts to stay healthy and pursue employment. 
 A typical family of three on assistance in New York City has, after rent, at most $6 a person a day in cash and food stamps to pay for food, clothing, utilities, transportation, school supplies and all other household needs. New York can afford a cost-of-living adjustment for public assistance. The caseload has fallen sharply, Federal spending has increased and public assistance is a tiny fraction of the state budget.

HEADLINE: Korea's New Democrat

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Koreans did not vote for Kim Dae Jung, a longtime pro-democracy campaigner, out of anger over the financial crisis and the International Monetary Fund reform package (front page, Dec. 19). He was elected because of overwhelming support in his home region of Cholla, disarray in the ruling camp and growing voter dissatisfaction with the status quo. 
 Concern over Mr. Kim's ability to address South Korea's financial crisis because of his populist leanings and connections to labor is misplaced. The root problem of South Korea's economy is not labor but the corrupt relationship between big business and government. As an outsider to the establishment, Mr. Kim may have the best chance of effecting the changes South Korea urgently needs to overcome the current crisis.

HEADLINE: When Public Needs Meet Private Money

BYLINE: By LAURIE FLYNN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 21

 BODY:
The California State University system, the nation's largest network of universities, is enmeshed in a spirited battle over a proposal to recognize four companies as the exclusive providers of networking, telecommunications and computing technology.
The plan, one of the most ambitious partnerships ever forged between the private sector and public education, was proposed three months ago as a way to finance much-needed new technologies for the 23 campuses and the 330,000 students of the financially constrained system. 
 Since then, students and faculty leaders on nearly every campus have debated the plan, which would give the four companies the exclusive right to install high-speed networks within the campuses, and the right to provide E-mail and other network services, to maintain the computers used by the staff and administrators, to develop software and to provide training and support.
The consortium is led by the telecommunications giant GTE and includes Fujitsu, Hughes Electronics and the Microsoft Corporation. Under the proposal, called the California Educational Technology Initiative, or CETI, the four companies would invest more than $300 million to install and maintain computing and communications equipment.
Although top university officials have hailed the proposal as a boon for the campuses and the companies involved, a growing number of students and faculty members are attacking it as anti-competitive and a threat to the principles of higher education.
A rally protesting the initiative attracted about 200 students at San Francisco State University two weeks ago, said Nathan Newman, president of Net Action, one of the groups leading the drive against the initiative.
A similar protest took place at Humboldt State University and included a group of students who replaced the school's entrance signs with ones that read "Microsoft University." Mr. Newman said 600 students had participated in the Humboldt rally, though university officials said the crowd was much smaller.
Net Action has long been a vocal critic of Microsoft's business practices, and indeed, the involvement of the software giant is among the most controversial elements of the proposed deal.
Even before the protests, mounting public pressure had led the system's board to delay a vote on the proposal until after a special hearing by the State Assembly, which will be held on Jan. 6.
"Much more discussion needs to take place of the ethical dilemma of a public-private partnership in education," said Kenneth B. Peter, chairman of the academic senate at San Jose State University, which voted unanimously to oppose the current plan.
"The question is whether the values of the private sector and public education can work together," he added.
One concern, Mr. Peter said, is that public employees might participate, whether inadvertently or intentionally, in serving the business interests of the consortium's member companies.
Other skeptics, including the union that represents the majority of university staff members, are worried that the consortium could jeopardize jobs as work now being done by the university is transferred to the companies.
Furthermore, critics say, handing over the university's entire computing business to a single private entity could transform the schools into training grounds for the companies' products.
For example, they warn that the arrangement could promote the use of personal computers that run Microsoft's Windows operating system over those that run Apple's Macintosh system or could encourage use of Microsoft's Internet browser, Explorer, over the Netscape Communications Corporation's browser, Navigator.
A chief concern of critics is that the initiative's business plan calls for the partners to generate revenues as high as $3 billion over 10 years by marketing services like pager accounts, technical support and high-speed Internet access to students and faculty members, who would become a captive audience for the partners' products.
Mr. Newman of Net Action asserted that universities, as incubators of innovation, should be technologically neutral. The initiative could turn the campuses into training schools for Microsoft, he said, which in turn could help the company control standards.
This is particularly important at the huge San Jose State campus, in the heart of Silicon Valley, where many of the school's graduates find jobs in technology companies every year.
But the initiative's members and supporters insist that the critics are misinformed about how the consortium would work.
The deal does not require students and staff members to buy only consortium products, but the economies of scale will lead to lower prices, said William Cannon, the director of computing and telecommunications for Humboldt State and the school's representative for the initiative. Besides, Microsoft already is the leading supplier of software used by students, he said.
Mr. Cannon said much of the criticism stemmed from the secrecy of the negotiations, which he said was necessary because the deal involved the discussion of confidential business information and future products. And the pace of decision making, which took place at what he called "corporate speed," has made faculty and staff members uncomfortable because decisions of this magnitude typically take several years in academia.
Still, consortium officials argue, a public-private partnership is the only feasible solution for the university system, which this year faces a budget gap of $70 million to $100 million in its technology program as it tries to upgrade its infrastructure.
"People can say it's not right, but what is the alternative?" said Patricia Cuocco, the university system's senior director for information technology policy and analysis and a participant in the negotiations. "The State of California is not going to supply the funds."
Further, Ms. Cuocco said, there is nothing in the proposal that hands over control of how technology is used.
"People think the corporations will control intellectual property or educational content," Ms. Cuocco said. "But there's nothing in the agreement that would allow that." In fact, she said, the companies would be required to provide whatever technologies the campuses requested.
Much of the criticism of the initiative seems to focus on Microsoft's role rather than on the basic relationship between the private sector and public education.
Alluding to the investigation and antitrust lawsuit under way by the United States Justice Department, Mr. Peter said, "We're not sure we want to be partners with a company that may be guilty of antitrust violations."
Ms. Cuocco said that Microsoft had been chosen to participate in the consortium because its products were already widely used by students and faculty members. What is more, she said, Microsoft has not actively participated in the negotiations, leaving that to GTE, the lead partner.
The point, Ms. Cuocco said, is that the university system has no choice if it hopes to stay competitive in the development and understanding of new technologies and to enhance its network as new technologies are developed. The only alternative, she said, would be a bond measure that would have little chance of passing.
"Is the alternative leaving a future generation of students ill prepared for the knowledge-based society of the future?" Ms. Cuocco asked. "That's unacceptable."

HEADLINE: The Old-Fashioned Almanac Thrives in the Age of the Internet

BYLINE: By SREENATH SREENIVASAN 

 BODY:
In the library of Oak Hill Elementary School in the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, Kan., one set of books gets used more than most: the almanacs.
"For class work and even for fun, the kids love to sit and read them for hours," said Sharon Coatney, the school's librarian. "Children are fascinated with trivia and new things. They love to ask each other, 'did you know such and such,' and almanacs give them a lot of such and suches." 
 Almanac publishers have counted on schools to introduce new generations of buyers to their books. Even in the era of CD-ROM's and the Internet, with their promise of vast storehouses of information, publishers remain enthusiastic about the business of almanacs, especially general-interest books like the World Almanac and Book of Facts and the Information Please Almanac.
Two big publishers entered the almanac market this year, bringing out The Wall Street Journal Almanac and The New York Times Almanac.
The economics of almanacs is appealing to publishers, because they can bring out new books every year at a relatively low cost. Although each year's edition will include new articles and other updated information, much of the data can be recycled from year to year. Moreover, although almanac sales are quite large by publishing standards, and there are no big-name authors demanding huge advances and royalties.
There is, of course, a wide variety of almanacs available, with some focusing mainly on sports or entertainment -- or on the weather as the Old Farmer's Almanac does. But the most popular are the general-interest almanacs, which compile hundreds of thousands of facts about a broad range of topics, from abortion to the zodiac. An estimated two million of these almanacs are sold each year, for less than $11 apiece.
And a large portion of those sales occur during the holiday season. The new almanacs dated 1998 appeared in bookstores in November and early December, and they are favored by some gift shoppers.
"These books are phenomenal sellers, especially during this season," said Robert Wietrak, a vice president of merchandise at Barnes & Noble. His stores sell 75 percent of their almanacs from November through January.
"Everyone likes almanacs and they make great stocking stuffers," he said. "We will sell about 300,000 almanacs altogether. That would make almanacs one of our top 10 nonfiction books for the year."
The giant in this category is the 130-year-old World Almanac, published by Primedia Reference Inc. It sells about 1.2 million copies each year, more than double the sales of its nearest competitor, the Information Please Almanac, published by Information Please L.L.C.
Now, Ballantine Books, a unit of Advance Publications that publishes The Wall Street Journal Almanac, and Penguin Reference Books, a subsidiary of Pearson P.L.C. that publishes The New York Times Almanac, are each betting that the name of a big national newspaper will provide a competitive edge.
"The almanac publishing business is a tough game," said John W. Wright, general editor of The New York Times Almanac. "To market against the World Almanac, you need another brand name, and that's where The Times comes in."
Ronald J. Alsop, editor of The Wall Street Journal Almanac, has a similar view. "Taking on the existing almanacs is not easy because you have to be truly distinctive to stand out," he said.
To that end, The Wall Street Journal Almanac has adopted some of the look and feel of the newspaper, with the articles and charts being provided by The Journal's staff.
Mr. Alsop, who is also a news editor at The Journal, which is owned by Dow Jones & Company, contended that his almanac was more forward-looking than its competitors. "Other almanacs have the history of the Liberty Bell," he said, "but is that really what people want to know? We have information that is relevant to people as we approach the year 2000. For example, we tell you what the fastest-growing occupations will be between now and 2005."
The New York Times Almanac, meanwhile, portrays itself as the "almanac of record," and Mr. Wright said the book reflected the newspaper's "thorough coverage of the U.S. and the world."
Unlike The Wall Street Journal Almanac, which was created from scratch, The New York Times Almanac has some of its roots in a prior book, the Universal Almanac.
Mr. Wright was previously the editor of the Universal Almanac. Its publisher, Andrews & McMeel, decided to discontinue the book with the 1997 issue. The Universal Almanac was well respected and comprehensive, but its sales were lower than those of its competitors.
But Mr. Wright owned the rights to the content of the Universal Almanac, so he approached The New York Times Company with the idea of creating a new almanac with the newspaper's name on it. Penguin was then brought in as the publisher.
The New York Times Almanac includes a good deal of information from the Universal Almanac, although Mr. Wright rejects contentions by rivals that the old almanac is merely repackaged. He noted that some members of The Times news staff contributed articles about the major news events of the year, as well as the maps in the book.
It is too early to tell whether the new books are making a serious dent in the market share of the older books. Ballantine said its first print run of The Wall Street Journal Almanac was 165,000 copies, while Penguin said it also printed 165,000 copies of The New York Times Almanac.
The World Almanac also traces its roots to the newspaper business. The first edition of the almanac was published by The New York World in 1868. That almanac ceased in 1876, but Joseph Pulitzer, who acquired The World in 1883, revived the book in 1886, and it has been published since then by various companies.
By most counts, almanacs tend to be impulse purchases that are not regularly repeated. According to Richard W. Eiger, publisher of the World Almanac, about 20 percent of his customers buy new almanacs every year, and about 50 percent buy new copies every two to three years.
Mr. Eiger said he was not overly worried by his new competitors. "We respect the competition and are alert to it," he said.
And Elizabeth Buckley Kubik, general manager of Information Please L.L.C., also showed little concern about the new almanacs. "We don't consider them players, because we are not sure if they are in it for the long run," she said. The Information Please Almanac, which has been published since 1947, is seeking a competitive advantage by providing a midyear update to book buyers who want it.
Regardless of the competition, Mr. Eiger said the World Almanac would maintain its $500,000 marketing budget. The others are estimated to spend at least $100,000 each.
He did point out, however, that the World Almanac did not raise its retail price from $9.95 a copy. The others are all $10.95 each.
Mr. Eiger said he was not surprised that almanacs sell well, even with competition from the Internet and CD-ROM's. "Our almanac allows you to get to specific information without trawling through dozens of Web sites to find it," he said.
Others have a similar view. "Finding information on the Internet can be a nightmare," said Barbara Berliner, coordinator of NYPL-Express, a fee-based research service of the New York Public Library. "With an almanac it's quicker, easier and more accurate."
Still, the almanac publishers are developing on-line projects. For example, Ms. Kubik of Information Please said her company had invested "a seven-figure sum" to open a World Wide Web site next month.
Meanwhile, at the Oak Hill Elementary School, the library is acquiring about 30 copies of the 1998 World Almanac. "As soon as the new books arrive, they are snapped up by the kids," Ms. Coatney said. "They will use them and use them until they fall clear apart."

HEADLINE: The Virtues of Addictive Games;
Computer Pastimes No Longer Viewed as Brain Poison

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash.

 BODY:
Inside a small room, the human guinea pig is picking up the pace, pointing and clicking. She hunches closer to the computer screen, moving the mouse quickly, up, down, left, left again.
She gazes intently at the scrambled pieces of a picture puzzle. The visual Rubik's cube -- if the pieces were all in place -- would be a landscape scene of an Egyptian pyramid. She moves the pieces swiftly to assemble the pyramid, brow furrowed and eyes fixed, trying one position after another. 
 Watching her from behind a one-way mirror, in a room next to the computer laboratory, Alexey Pajitnov smiles with satisfaction and pumps a fist in the air. "She's hooked," he declared.
This is the moment that game designers like Mr. Pajitnov, a bearded, genial 42-year-old at the Microsoft Corporation, labor endlessly to achieve -- the moment when curiosity turns to compulsion. It is an elusive goal that, according to Mr. Pajitnov, involves creating a game with an "emotional rhythm" that moves a player across a psychic border, alternating a sense of achievement and loss, pleasure and disappointment.
"You must tease the nerves," he explained.
Searching for the ingredients of compulsion remains the Holy Grail of the $4-billion-a-year business of computer and video games. It is a search that has become far more respectable in the last few years as a growing body of research suggests that playing computer games may actually be good for young minds -- a message that parents may find reassuring during the peak holiday sales season for the games.
Computer and video games, researchers say, can help children develop their skills of visualization, concentration and problem-solving, as well as help them acquire a fluency in technology. Some experts even point to the games as a possible contributing factor in the steady rise in I.Q. scores in developed nations.
In one study of 200 students in the United States and Italy, researchers found that playing video games developed spatial skills and informally prepared children for learning about science and technology. The study, published in the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology in 1994, concluded that computer games "are not a waste of time."
Computer games, it seems, are a form of intellectual exercise. Strengthening the mental muscles used in these games, researchers say, will increasingly be an advantage in an economy where technology plays an ever-greater role.
"The same skills used in computer games are basic technology literacy skills," said Patricia M. Greenfield, a professor of psychology at the University of California at Los Angeles. "Those skills are extremely important in the modern world."
In Seattle, William D. Winn, director of the Learning Center at the Human Interface Technology Laboratory of the University of Washington, has found that young people "internalize" the ability to visualize the images they create on computers, often enhancing their ability to visualize people and events when they read.
In psychology, some academics have long been studying what is called flow, a state of deep concentration, total absorption and intellectual peak performance that is the mental equivalent of what athletes describe as being in the "zone." Research on flow has tended to focus on serious brain work like playing chess and software programming.
"But there is no question that you can experience flow by becoming immersed in computer games," said Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a professor of psychology and education at the University of Chicago.
Praising computer games was heresy years ago when parents, educators and researchers fretted about the dangers of electronic recreation. A generation of America's youth, by some accounts, seemed to have succumbed to the mindless addiction of computer games. C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, once warned darkly that "children are into the games body and soul."
Today, there are still concerns about children being allowed to play violent adult games or spending endless hours hunched in front of a computer. Yet these problems are now seen mainly as matters best dealt with by parental guidance and common sense rather than as unique and unsettling threats to the mental health of young people.
"There has been a real shift from people being afraid that computer games would dry up kids' brains to the view that there are good things about them," said Idit Harel, a former research scientist at the M.I.T. Media Laboratory who has founded an Internet media company -- Mamamedia Inc. -- that produces educational games for children.
Ms. Harel attributes the more favorable attitude toward computer games partly to new research, but also to the human evidence. "The kids who grew up immersed in computer games are now in their 20's, and they are for the most part a generation of bright, thoughtful and successful young people," she said.
One of them, J. C. Herz, a 26-year-old Harvard alumna, wrote a personalized social history of computer and video games, Joystick Nation, published earlier this year.
Even the rapid rise of the Internet, Ms. Herz believes, owes a debt to the electronic playpen of early computer games. "They were training wheels for the Internet," she said. "The Net never would have spread as fast as it did without our generation being comfortable manipulating images on a screen."
The Russian-born Mr. Pajitnov, who joined Microsoft last year, introduced millions of people to a potent blend of skill, concentration and compulsion found in the best computer games. He designed Tetris, perhaps the most irresistibly habit-forming computer game ever. Tetris, an elegantly simple puzzle game requiring the player to reorder cascading geometric shapes, sold 40 million copies on every format from personal computers to Nintendo hand-held video-game players.
For Mr. Pajitnov to even approach his past success will be a long shot. So much has changed in the computer game industry since the late-1980's, when Tetris arrived. Today's hit games, like Myst, Quake and Civilization II, tend to be Hollywood-style productions with three-dimensional animations and elaborate musical scores.
At Microsoft, Mr. Pajitnov is laboring to revive the popularity of computer puzzle games, which ebbed during the 1990's as the industry focused mainly on action games. Even Mr. Pajitnov succumbed. After emigrating from Russia in 1991, he tried his hand at a couple of "shoot 'em up" games, but without great success.
"I keep coming back to the puzzles," he said. "I feel really good at them."
By the standards of today's action-game best sellers, the puzzle genre can seem a sleepy anachronism, slow moving and cerebral. The puzzle game renaissance he hopes to lead may well be slow work, Mr. Pajitnov conceded, saying that he came to Microsoft a year ago because it was a big company with patience and deep pockets.
In July, Mr. Pajitnov's first effort, Microsoft Entertainment Pack: The Puzzle Collection, a CD-ROM with 10 puzzles, hit store shelves. So far, sales have ranged from 2,500 to 5,000 copies a month -- not a hit, but probably a moneymaker, says Ann Stephens, president of PC Data Inc., a research firm in Reston, Va.
Mr. Pajitnov's current project, it seems, is another modest beginning. The picture puzzle game tested recently in Microsoft's computer lab is one offering in a collection of logic, word and image puzzles called Mind Aerobics. The collection was released earlier this month on the company's on-line service, which charges subscribers a monthly fee. Later, the puzzles may also be placed on a stand-alone Web site, available to anyone with Internet access.
The intent of Mind Aerobics is not to lure people into hour after hour of play but, as its name suggests, provide users with 20 or 25 minutes a day of intense "exercise for the brain."
One mental workout is a picture puzzle called Rotascope. It appears on the screen as a fractured circular image, fragments of a picture, scrambled in concentric rings. The player chooses from three levels of difficulty. At level three -- the hardest -- there are five concentric rings of distorted pieces of a picture.
One space is vacant, allowing the pieces to be moved, sorted and rearranged. It is straightforward at first, pieces slipping into place, points racking up. It seems simple. It is not. The path to completion can be torturous -- point, click, drag, faster and faster. Almost got it. No, not quite. Time's running out. . . . Welcome to the compulsive pleasure of puzzle games.
The puzzles are being offered on line because that is where the computing audience is heading. "Soon everyone who uses computers will be on the Net," Mr. Pajitnov said. "So if I want to establish the puzzle, expose as many people as possible to this intellectual pleasure, I have to get them on the Net."
The Internet is indeed seen as the future of gaming, and most experts agree that future will be far more than action games. By 2001, the number of on-line game players will nearly triple, to 18.4 million people, while revenues will surge twelvefold, to $1.6 billion, mostly from advertising, estimates Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.
Most of the growth, says Seema Williams of Forrester, is going to have to come not from the die-hard action-game audience of post-adolescent males but from increasing numbers of women and people of all ages who play games only a half-hour a week or so. Puzzle games do well with this wider audience.
"If the on-line game market is going to become mainstream, it is going to have to move beyond Quake to things like puzzles, the kinds of things that Alexey Pajitnov knows so well," Ms. Williams said.

Chart: "Pieces of a Successful Puzzle Game"
With the right ingredients, a game designer can make a player forget about everything else.
 
Within a minute, the player must understand how to play; within three, he must be immersed.
 
The player should be constantly prodded to take the next step; there should be no stopping point until the end.
 
Surfing the edge of that line between challenge and frustration is what great game design is about, says Kenn Lobb, development manager at Nintendo of America.
 
The chef's special stuff," as Microsoft's Alexey Pajitnov puts it. Game design is as much an art as a science. (pg. D14)

HEADLINE: Bill Gates, Meet Your Adversary, the Antitrust Chief

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
At work, Joel I. Klein uses the Netscape Navigator to search the Internet. At home, he relies on Microsoft's Internet Explorer. The reason he uses different Web browsers, he says, is because the computers at his home and at his office were already loaded with them when they were bought.
That, in a nutshell, is the consumer practice that lies behind the most significant antitrust action to be brought by the Government in a generation, a case in which Mr. Klein is chief architect as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division. 
 Two months ago, Mr. Klein filed a court challenge to the Microsoft Corporation's marketing strategy, which required all computer makers who wanted to install the software giant's Windows 95, the world's most popular operating system, to also install its Internet browser.
Last week, after winning a court order that forces the company to unbundle the two software programs, he escalated the fight when he asked a judge to hold Microsoft in contempt. He also asked the court to give him the unusual authority to review future Microsoft products to make sure that they are not attempts to corner new markets.
For some lawyers and antitrust experts, Mr. Klein's decision was the biggest surprise since Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, helped bail out his traditional nemesis, Apple Computer Inc., earlier this year.
A few months before the case, Mr. Klein's confirmation as Assistant Attorney General was unsuccessfully filibustered by a handful of Senate Democrats who, along with some consumer groups, had complained that he was strong on promoting big business and weak on enforcing antitrust law.
Conservative Republicans, on the other hand, endorsed the nomination. Both sides focused on the fact that as the acting head of the antitrust division, Mr. Klein had approved Bell Atlantic's $23 billion acquisition of Nynex, creating a new telecommunications behemoth with 39 million telephone lines from Maine to Virginia. "We've got an antitrust fellow here who rolls over and plays dead," Senator Ernest Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, said at Mr. Klein's confirmation hearing.
Moreover, as the No. 2 official in the antitrust division a year earlier, Mr. Klein successfully persuaded other Justice Department officials to refrain from challenging Microsoft's strategy of installing the icon of its on-line service, the Microsoft Network, in all Windows 95 programs, an effort by the software colossus to promote its network over such rivals as America Online.
Officials said Mr. Klein had argued that that market was already competitive and that the mere presence of a Microsoft Network icon on the computer screen would not by itself enable the company to leverage its dominance in the world of operating systems into control over networks and Internet access providers.
"There was a rumor some months ago that this guy was afraid of the big guys and wouldn't attack them," said Stephen M. Axinn, an antitrust specialist in New York. "Nobody is saying that anymore. These are suddenly becoming the halcyon days for antitrust."
What makes the current antitrust fight particularly significant is that the World Wide Web is emerging as the next new platform for global commerce, research and entertainment. Not since the Government took on the likes of AT&T and I.B.M. more than a generation ago has the antitrust division issued such a challenge to a corporate titan.
In fact, with the decision to prosecute Microsoft, Mr. Klein has put antitrust back on the front pages and guaranteed that the division is involved in cutting-edge legal and economic issues in a way that his predecessor, Anne K. Bingaman, had tried, but with less success.
"It was right and it was courageous," said Eleanor Fox, a professor of antitrust law at New York University. "He had to make a considered judgment about whether the worst problem is a monopoly or Government intervention."
Microsoft executives and lawyers see the matter differently. They say that Mr. Klein is trying to micromanage Microsoft and is a pawn in a larger struggle between the company and its rivals -- one that should be sorted out by the marketplace.
In an Op-Ed article in The Wall Street Journal last month, Mr. Gates said that the antitrust division's position was "akin to the Government telling personal computer manufacturers that they can't include word processing, spreadsheet or E-mail capability in PC's because it would be unfair to typewriter, calculator and courier companies."
While Mr. Gates appears to be making many of the crucial decisions in the fight against the Government, he, too has arrayed an impressive legal team. At the head of that team is William H. Neukom, the company's senior vice president for law and corporate affairs, who was chosen nearly 20 years ago by Mr. Gates's father, William Gates Jr., a Seattle lawyer, to represent his son's young company in Redmond, Wash.
Among industry lawyers, Mr. Neukom is known as a smart and aggressive advocate who has played a pivotal role in the phenomenal success of the company. A former marathon runner, Mr. Neukom, 55, is seen within his company as someone who brings a long-term perspective to the negotiating table.
His in-house legal department now has about 70 lawyers, and for the antitrust case he has retained two top-flight firms, Sullivan & Cromwell of New York and Covington & Burling of Washington. The partners at those firms involved in the case include Richard J. Urowsky, who has been the company's top advocate in court, and Charles F. Rule, one of Mr. Klein's predecessors at the Justice Department, who joined this case at the beginning of December.
According to Peter N. Detkin, the vice president and assistant general counsel at the Intel Corporation, Mr. Neukom is a "very smart, very aggressive, good lawyer." His style, Mr. Detkin said, is "hard-charging, like everybody else at Microsoft."
As formidable as Microsoft's legal team is, it faces a seasoned roster of Government lawyers. Mr. Klein's chief deputy at the antitrust division, and his right-hand man in the Microsoft case, has been A. Douglas Melamed, a graduate of Yale Law School who came to the Justice Department last year from the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering.
The newest member of the Government's team is David Boies, a former partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore and one of New York's most prominent litigators. Mr. Boies was an important member of the legal team of I.B.M. that beat back the Government in the 1970's. He then moved on to represent such high-profile clients as CBS and Texaco.
But the lead strategist for the team is Mr. Klein, a 51-year-old native of the Bronx who has known President Clinton for at least 15 years, seeing him annually at the Renaissance Weekends in Hilton Head, S.C. Before Mr. Clinton arrived at the White House, Mr. Klein had been known as a specialist in appellate court arguments.
Cerebral and soft-spoken, he began his legal career after studying economics at Columbia University and then moving on to Harvard Law School. He won clerkships for two of the nation's most prominent judges, Chief Judge David Bazelon on the United States Court of Appeals in Washington and Associate Justice Lewis Powell of the Supreme Court.
He joined the Administration in the summer of 1993 in one of its most demanding positions, taking the post of deputy White House counsel soon after Vincent W. Foster Jr. committed suicide. In that post, he advised the White House on a variety of politically sensitive matters, notably the Clinton's ties to Whitewater. He also prepared Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her Supreme Court confirmation hearing.
Mr. Klein says that his most fundamental mission is to insure that antitrust principles first developed to regulate smokestack industries be correctly applied to emerging technologies to promote competition and innovation.
"We ought to drive our analysis on economic efficiencies on the view that we want to encourage the best goods and services at the best prices to consumers," he said. "I have a fundamentally pragmatic view. It is basically that markets will function efficiently, and our job is to extend market power through accommodation. You want to create circumstances in which the right innovation signals are given.
"I think calling it a middle view is right," he added. "I don't view it is as activism, and I don't view it as regulatory. I really view our mission as being market driven."
In the Microsoft case, some experts caution that Mr. Klein and the antitrust division face several obstacles as they pursue Microsoft, which is only one of a number of companies that they are trying to block from using their formidable power in one market to gain control over another.
"The last eight or nine assistant attorneys general had little impact," said Paul MacAvoy, a professor at the Yale School of Management who specializes in antitrust and regulated industries. "This is your chance, Joel, to become a giant in the field if you win, a real hero in the casebooks. If you don't though, you will create one hell of a mess."
The mess, he added, is that Mr. Klein will go down in history as "a socialist doodler who destroys the firms that do the best and most important work for the economy."
"He's playing at the edge," Professor MacAvoy said.

HEADLINE: Rediscovering the Heart of Town;
Personal Touch Draws Shoppers, Bringing Fading Business Centers Back to Life

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: SOMERVILLE, N.J., Dec. 15

 BODY:
Avoiding the mid-December frenzy at the mall this afternoon, Cathy Ferris drove into this pretty town of pre-Revolutionary landmarks and classic American Victorian architecture, parked her car and strolled a short way down Main Street into Beneath It All, a lingerie shop, to find a gift for her mother.
Ms. Ferris had barely asked a question before the store owner, Lorraine V. Sarra, darted out from behind the counter. For 15 minutes, they chatted about underwear like old friends at tea, standing elbow to elbow as Mrs. Sarra guided Ms. Ferris through the merchandise until she had selected just the right white camisole. 
 "I go to the mall and I can't find a single person who knows something about anything," Ms. Ferris said as Mrs. Sarra boxed and wrapped the camisole. "I'd rather come and get a little attention."
Other shoppers, too, have become weary of crowded malls and chain stores, and are re-exploring local downtowns, a phenomenon particularly noticeable at the height of the holiday shopping season. They are enticed by the homey atmosphere and more attentive customer service.
But while shopping on Main Street may evoke sensations of yesteryear, Somerville and other towns throughout New Jersey and, indeed, across the country are transforming themselves, seeking an identity that will help them survive. Gone are many of the traditional shops that sold life's staple goods with a smile. Gone, too, are classic five and dimes -- in Somerville, as everywhere, the old Woolworth's stands gloomily vacant in the heart of downtown.
Haberdasheries in Somerville have been turned into restaurants and specialty retailers. The cracked sidewalks in the central business area have been replaced by interlocking brick-red and slate-gray paving stones shaped in octagons and rectangles. The purely functional metal street lights have been taken down, and traditional lampposts have been put up in their stead. Plant beds and wooden benches have been added all across the downtown. A business recruitment program is under way to fill storefront vacancies. And customers are coming.
Over the last decade, downtown revitalization efforts nationwide have led to an increase of about 20 percent in jobs and in the number of businesses, said Doug Loescher, assistant director of the National Main Street Center in Washington, which helps revitalize downtowns and conducts surveys of the towns with which it works. Property values are up about 90 percent, and vacancy rates, once as high as 32 percent, now average 6 percent, Mr. Loescher said.
Towns that are making a comeback have done so not by stealing customers back from the malls and big-box stores like Home Depot and Barnes & Noble, but by refocusing their business efforts.
"One of our greatest challenges when we go into a community," Mr. Loescher said, "is to convince the local business establishment that the future of the district is not what the past was economically."
The old downtowns, he said, served just the immediate area, providing basic goods and services. "Today," he said, "these districts are casting their net much more widely, drawing in people from further away who are coming for very specific things."
Somerville's motivation to rekindle its downtown came from the development of Bridgewater Commons, a giant mall less than a mile away, in the late 1980's. The town created a business improvement district, an area designated by local law. The district receives money from an extra property tax that is used to refurbish and promote it.
The creation of such districts became a common strategy in the mid- to late 1980's, and there are now 34 improvement districts in New Jersey and more than 1,300 across the country. "The motivation, usually, is the same for all of them," said Beth Peterson, the executive director of Downtown New Jersey, a statewide association of improvement districts. "The mayor and council and residents look around and say, 'Hey, this downtown looks terrible.' "
Rich Reitman, the chairman of Somerville's District Management Corporation, said he had lobbied for the district in 1988 because "we had seen what happened to some towns, like Dover when the Rockaway Town Square Mall opened a half-mile away." Those towns, he said, "didn't do anything, and just kind of deteriorated."
With an assessment of 7.2 percent of the previous year's property taxes, Somerville's management corporation started with a budget of $100,000 a year. With property tax increases, the district's annual budget is now about $170,0000. Like many towns, Somerville started with a beautification project as a way to show immediate results that benefited everyone. "The town wasn't pedestrian friendly," Mr. Reitman said. So the district undertook the $1.6 million sidewalk and lamppost project, which was paid for with a bond issue. The district also created an architectural review board to regulate renovation and construction in the downtown area.
To generate traffic downtown, Somerville mimicked Cranford, the home of New Jersey's first improvement district, which offered free outdoor concerts on Thursdays. Somerville started free concerts on Friday nights. Soon afterward, a classic car club asked to hold a weekly cruise show on Friday nights. The town agreed, and the two events draw up to 4,000 people, Mr. Reitman said.
Somerville still sponsors such traditional entertainment events as Santa Claus's visit, horse-drawn carriage rides on Main Street, and the Tour de Somerville bicycle race on Memorial Day weekend. But it now considers them another way to bring people downtown, and not as simply another service for shoppers.
There have been setbacks. Only one men's shop, selling big and tall sizes, remains on Main Street. Some shoe and jewelry stores have closed, and there are still about 20 vacancies, said Marta Person, a consultant hired in August to attract retail businesses to Somerville.
Slowly, two themes began to emerge in Somerville. One was food, with many new eating places featuring a variety of ethnic cuisines: Chinese, Italian, Indian, Thai, Cuban. The other came from the antique stores that opened on Division Street. With existing shops, an antiques row was created. There is a stained-glass art shop and a host of gift shops, including the Big Little Railroad Shop, which sells model trains, and Crystal Palace, which sells fine glassware and ceramics.
"There is a total new feeling," said Lloyd Silverman, who has owned Lloyd's Furniture on Main Street since 1950. "It's an air that people enjoy coming down. The atmosphere is just what they are looking for. It's away from the mall. The stores were running away from downtown. Now, I think there is a resurgence of stores coming back. Sales are up. I don't think it's difficult to compete with the chains. I think people just got in the habit of going to the malls. Now, I think the swing is back to us."
Nationwide, the revitalization and refocusing of downtown areas is lending some balance to patterns of retail shopping among malls, big-box stores and downtowns, said Mr. Loescher of the National Main Street Center. "It's not like one of these sectors is going to win out ultimately and the others are going to lose," he said. "It's really each one finding their place."
In interviews up and down Main Street, shoppers said the downtown stores had found a place in their lives, while many also said that they come to town for services as much as for retail shopping. "Down here you do shopping for the oddball kinds of things, the antique stores, the gift shops, for something off the beaten path," said Mike Moceikis, 38, a designer for Ortho-McNeil, who was buying a train set at the Big Little Railroad Shop.
Carol Kravette, who was with her 4-year-old son, Kyle, said she missed a maternity shop that had closed on Division Street and a toy store that went out of business on Main Street, but that she still came from her home in nearby Neshanic Station to get haircuts, to bank and to buy Kyle's shoes. Like many people, Mrs. Kravette said she liked the experience of shopping downtown.
Cathy Lavin, who with her husband, Peter, has owned the P. C. Lavin card shop on Main Street for 18 years, says she sees two kinds of customers: those who like to shop at the mall and the ones who like to shop downtown.
"The people who prefer to shop downtown like the personal experience," she said. "There is a life that a town has that people like to be a part of." She added: "If we don't have something, we refer customers to someone else in town who has it. People get a big kick out of that."
Mrs. Lavin dismissed any notion that downtown was at all the worse because its role had changed over the years. "What hasn't changed?" she asked. "Whenever anybody says that to me I say, 'What's your occupation?' Life is full of change."

Along with other towns nationwide, Somerville has revitalized its downtown area, adding esthetic touches like geometric paving stones, lampposts and benches.

HEADLINE: Okinawa Vote Rejects New U.S. Military Base

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Voters in Okinawa dealt a sharp and unexpected blow today to plans for an American military base there that Japan and the United States have been planning for more than a year.
The vote, the first referendum in Japan about a proposed American military base, offered the remarkable spectacle of 16,000 voters in a remote Japanese town defying their Prime Minister and threats of economic punishment if they opposed the base. They have thrown into doubt a project that has been discussed and researched at length between the highest levels of American and Japanese Government. 
 The outcome of the referendum underscored the antipathy in Okinawa to American military bases there. The vote also raised questions about the reliability of Japan in the American-Japan security partnership, and it throws into uncertainty a widely-hailed plan by the two Governments to consolidate the American military bases in Okinawa.
"This is every citizen's victory," said Yasuhiro Miyagi, an opponent of the American bases. "We do not need bases. And we seek peace."
Okinawa is a chain of islands in the far south of Japan, the poorest part of the country but also perhaps the most beautiful. It accounts for less than 1 percent of Japanese land but has three-quarters of American military bases in Japan.
Public hostility to the American military presence surged in 1995 after three American servicemen were arrested, and later convicted, for kidnapping and gang-raping a sixth-grade girl. The anger spread from Okinawa to the rest of Japan, and for a time officials worried that the rising anger might eventually force the eviction of the American troops in Japan.
The hostility has subsided in most of Japan, but it is still considerable in Okinawa. The United States and Japan announced a much-hailed plan in 1996 to consolidate the American military presence in Okinawa and to close a heliport called Futenma Air Station within seven years.
However, the Americans inserted language in the agreement specifying that Futenma would be closed down only after Japan had built an equivalent heliport somewhere else. Japanese and American planners eventually settled on an offshore base, to be built as an island 1,500 yards long and 300 yards wide, just off the Okinawa coast.
The Government of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto invested time and credibility in the proposed base, which was thought to be less offensive to Okinawans because no one would be living right around it. American officials were also excited about the proposal because it would be the first of its kind and would offer a chance to test the technology for it -- which Japan would pay for, but which would have military and industrial uses in other parts of the world.
The nearby Okinawan town of Nago had misgivings, however, and decided to hold today's referendum. The outcome is not legally binding, but Mr. Hashimoto painted himself into a corner by saying that he would not go ahead with the base if local people opposed it.
Mr. Hashimoto, who had no immediate comment, was particularly humiliated by the vote and may find his already-weak power base in Parliament further eroded.
Tetsuya Higa, Mayor of Nago, did not commit himself to honoring the vote and opposing the construction of the heliport but said he would weigh the referendum carefully.
"I receive the yes and no voices of the citizens expressed in the result of this referendum very gravely," Mr. Higa said. "I would like to examine and cope with this matter very carefully."
It is still possible that the central Government will put more pressure on the citizens of Nago and sweeten the package in some way -- or else find another site for an offshore base. But this would take time and would add to the uncertainties about the American bases in Okinawa. It may now be difficult to meet the timetable for closing Futenma Air Station.
The outcome was a surprise because the central Government had put enormous pressure on Nago to go along with the plan for the offshore heliport. Cabinet officials suggested that Nago would get economic development funds if it approved the heliport but would be left to stagnate if it rejected the project.
Some 3,000 Japanese military officers from Okinawa were told to solicit support for the proposal in Nago, and hundreds of officials from a military agency went house-to-house in Nago to urge people to approve the heliport. In addition, the referendum question was written with four potential answers in the hope of garnering the maximum possible support for the base.
But when the vote was tallied, 16,639 voters opposed the heliport and 14,267 favored it. The opposition was partly pacifist, based on firm opposition to military preparations.
Okinawa was the only part of Japan to experience ground-to-ground fighting in World War II, and it remains deeply pacifist today.

HEADLINE: Expert on Iran, G.O.P. Lawmaker Pleads to Be Heard

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Bill Clinton, meet Bob Ney.
Way down the Capitol Hill food chain is a 43-year-old conservative Republican from rural Ohio who has been in Congress three years and is best known for toughening work requirements for food stamp recipients. 
 But Mr. Ney also has an intriguing background and expertise: He once lived in Iran and is the only member of Congress who speaks fluent Farsi.
In the wake of the announcement by Iran's President Mohammad Khatami that he wants a "thoughtful" dialogue with the United States, and Mr. Clinton's reply that he would like "nothing better," Mr. Ney hopes to put his skills to good use.
"I haven't sent a personal note to Bill Clinton or anything like that," said Mr. Ney, a loyal soldier in the Republican ranks who knows his place. "Being a member of Congress, you don't just singularly conduct foreign policy. But if the President called, I'd be more than happy to help, more than happy, and to find other members, too."
Since Mr. Khatami was swept into office last May on a platform of tolerance and respect for the rule of law, Mr. Ney has unabashedly told stories about Iran to Rotary Clubs, town meetings and almost anyone else who will listen.
He explains how wonderful the Iranian people are, how great the food is, how family values are more embedded there than in the United States and how he was dead wrong when he supported isolating Iran after he entered Congress.
So far, however, Mr. Ney has not had much luck getting through to either the Administration or the leadership in Congress.
Shortly after Mr. Khatami's election, Mr. Ney called the State Department and had what he called a polite but unencouraging conversation with an unidentified desk officer dealing with Iran.
He then took his case to the White House, telling his story to a mid-ranking official dealing with legislative affairs who gave him a thanks-we'll-get-back-to-you reply.
And when he heard that his mentor, Newt Gingrich, was thinking of forming a task force on Iran, he stopped the Speaker of the House in the corridor one day and asked to join. He never heard back.
"I've told everybody, 'I'm here.' If anyone wants to communicate, I'm here," he said. "But I don't get the sense it's on the front burner."
Back home in Ohio, Mr. Ney corners anyone in his path. While waiting for a haircut at Roger's Barber Shop in Belleaire, Ohio, on Tuesday, he asked a customer what he thought of talking to Iran. "He was going off the wall about Iraq and he kind of growled a little bit at first," Mr. Ney said. "Then he came around and said, 'Well, as long as we don't talk to Iraq."'
In an interview with Voice of America on Thursday, Mr. Ney said: "I tell you, we're dealing with Vietnam! If we can communicate with Vietnam, we can begin to communicate with Iran."
And at a Head Start initiative at the Holiday Inn in Cambridge, Ohio, on Friday, Mr. Ney told constituents: "The President of Iran has sent out an olive branch. We should listen to it."
Mr. Ney became enchanted with Iran when a teen-age Iranian boy came to live with his sister's family in nearby West Virginia for a year.
As an education major at Ohio State University, Mr. Ney spent long hours with him learning Farsi, making friends with a clutch of Iranian students on campus along the way.
When he could not get a job teaching high school history, Mr. Ney decided to go to Iran. In 1978, with $500 in his pocket, and a suitcase full of blue jeans and Aramis cologne to trade, he made his first trip overseas.
For nearly a year, as Iran was gripped by protests, riots and firebombings in the first stages of its revolution, Mr. Ney taught English in Shiraz. Fearing for his safety as the violence got worse, he headed home and never went back.
There was a time when Mr. Ney thought the best thing that could happen to Iran was the overthrow of the ayatollahs. He voted for punitive economic sanctions that penalize foreign companies that have ambitious oil and gas development projects in Iran.
But in the last few months, he has changed his mind.
"I was a hard-liner," Mr. Ney said. "I was opposed to any communication. I voted for sanctions. But we're alone in our policy. Sanctions have failed. We're alone. What are we going to do, attack the rest of the world. We're supposed to sanction Canada. Canada?"
At a time when a handful of lawmakers are quietly investigating whether they should try to visit Iran, Mr. Ney said he would love to go back.
"Would I be willing to do it?" he said. "Yep. I'm more than willing. Absolutely," "But if that doesn't happen, at least I'd like to make a suggestion that we have some official type of communication -- maybe through some members of Congress. Maybe we could meet on some neutral ground, like Ireland. The mullahs go there a lot. Even an informal type of luncheon, with Iranian food, of course."

HEADLINE: Economy Purrs in High Gear, But Traffic Idles in Gridlock

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
These days, despite holiday gridlock and Madison Avenue brick-shower snarl, one mantra has had a soothing effect on the panic center of the Manhattan driver: it will all get better after the holidays.
But chances are, it won't. 
 Even before the holiday season, which has brought about 90,000 more vehicles into Manhattan each day, the daily influx of traffic was higher than ever -- more than 900,000 cars, trucks and buses.
This year "the volume of traffic is unprecedented," said Inspector James F. McShane, executive officer of the Police Department's Traffic Control Division, which oversees 2,000 uniformed agents.
Experts say that there are not only more cars, but also bigger cars -- limousines and sport utility vehicles -- and that traffic is clotting longer during the rush hours and later at night at unexpected choke points outside hotels and office buildings.
Many arteries leading to the heart of the city are congested as never before. For example, traffic in the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels and on the George Washington Bridge is up more than 5 percent in 1997; the year's total is expected to exceed the 85.2 million vehicle crossings in 1996, the highest ever.
Even revenue from Manhattan's 16,465 parking meters is up 18.8 percent over the previous fiscal year to $22.39 million, a record. Although recent comprehensive statistics for private parking lots is unavailable, revenue from the city's own lots and garages is up 16 percent over last year, to $6.5 million.
Traffic is so bad because "very simply, there are too many cars for too few streets," said Christopher R. Lynn, the city's Transportation Commissioner until he resigned this month. Beyond the surge in tourism, the boom on Broadway and the lure of a safer city, he said, the principal cause is the strong economy. "Ironically, traffic is positive news," said Eugene Spruck, acting chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "It means we have a very healthy economy. We've added about 100,000 private-sector jobs over the last two years."
Beyond statistics, the traffic situation can be measured in more mundane ways. Mohammed Mahmoud, a 37-year-old taxi driver from Bangladesh, said he pays $5 to $6 more per day for gas this year than last because of time spent in traffic. "If you don't move, you can't make money in this business," he said.
It can hurt in other ways, too. "Traffic-jam back pain is the worst," said Jacob Mathew, who has driven a cab for 10 years. "And my back pain is worse now because the traffic is worse."
Traffic is crawling at an average of 6.2 miles an hour on midtown city streets this year, the slowest it has ever been. Crosstown traffic is so bad, said Jackie Mason, the comedian, that "now you can get from First Avenue to Eighth Avenue in the time it would take you to fly to Boston or Philadelphia."
Mr. Mason was recently caught in gridlock on 10th Avenue and West 37th Street, and "it took 25 minutes to go four blocks," he said. "That's because they built this city in the time when the only person who had a car was John D. Rockefeller."
Contributing to the disarray is the phenomenon of "Town Car lock," the dread accumulation of black cars and limousines. The drivers block lanes as they wait for clients outside places like the Regency Hotel, on Park Avenue at 61st Street, every morning during the power-breakfast window, from 7:30 to 9:30 A.M.
Carlos Rosado, a driver for Atlantic Bank of New York, stood by his Lexus 400 and surveyed a double-parked line of 12 cars, which is regularly dispersed by traffic sweeps. "It's getting harder and harder to find a place to wait for our clients," he said. "When the police chase us, that makes traffic worse, because we're driving around again."
He joins the midtown ranks of day-tripping drivers, who spend an average of 40 minutes looking for a parking space, according to the Department of Transportation.
Other New York institutions, like the horse-drawn carriages at Central Park, get their share of blame for causing traffic bedlam, "but we do our best to keep out of the way," said Basil Northam, a hansom-cab driver for 13 years. Mr. Northam and about 50 other Central Park drivers do not leave their garages until 9:30 A.M., after the worst of the rush. "And we don't cut people off or triple park like the taxicab drivers do," he said.
Oft-blamed, taxi drivers are oft-summonsed as well. They have attracted 2,139 tickets in Manhattan just since Thanksgiving. But cabbies say that they, too, are entitled to complain. "Passengers have no patience, so they just leave the cab; they abandon you," said Abdul Rashid, 30, a driver from Pakistan.
Even when traffic might be expected to flow, uncertainty rules. "There is no rhyme or reason to traffic patterns anymore," said Michael Hirschfeld, a lawyer at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy. Recently, heading to a New Jersey dinner party at 6:30 on a Saturday evening, he was driving his wife, Grey, from 94th Street and Lexington Avenue to the Lincoln Tunnel, "which takes 15 minutes at that time," he said.
After fighting "insane traffic" on every southbound avenue on the East Side, he crossed Central Park at 79th Street "only to find that Central Park West was backed up, Broadway was backed up and Riverside Drive backed up," he said. "I was toast."
Ultimately, "I used every devious traffic trick," he said, "and it still took me an hour and 10 minutes to get to the tunnel."
In part, Gov. George E. Pataki has used traffic reduction to justify his schedule of discount passes for subways and buses. "That could ease traffic in the long run," Mr. Lynn said, "because people will leave their autos in the outer boroughs in favor of subways and buses."
James W. Harris, executive director of the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, the state's regional planning organization, said: "The future of traffic in Manhattan is not hopeless. But to get drivers to leave their cars at home, we have to give them lots of workable options."
Among the proposals are bringing Metro-North Commuter Railroad trains to the financial district, bringing Long Island Rail Road trains to Grand Central Terminal and keeping trucks from crossing Manhattan to get to Long Island and New England.
And if toll increases at bridges and tunnels are "politically difficult," Mr. Harris said, so-called congestion-pricing toll increases at peak hours might win approval as a way to ward off more cars.
The nerve center of New York City's traffic web these days is a quiet, carpeted, teal-and-gray outpost in Long Island City, Queens. There, a crew of eight shares the Department of Transportation's Traffic Management Center with 28 video screens.
Connected to cameras at vehicular crisis points, the screens give the team a full-color, godlike view of traffic in Manhattan each morning. The center also uses up-to-date technology to cope with the agony, like the six variable-message signs on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, where traffic warnings are posted.
If innovation is helping to coordinate the daily response to the rush-hour assault, critics point to some other good news. "There has been a tremendous improvement in the infrastructure, and the roads and bridges are in much better shape than before," said Mark J. Kulewicz, director of traffic engineering for the New York chapter of the American Automobile Association.
The Department of Transportation is installing more variable-message signs and has a new policy that requires most construction companies to complete jobs in 15 days, rather than the traditional 30.
For the first time, traffic agents are riding buses, jumping out at stops to ticket vehicles blocking bus lanes. And the police have flooded 20-square-block areas with enforcement agents, tow trucks and motorcycles to zap every violator in sight.
Since Thanksgiving the focus has been midtown, Inspector McShane said. During that time, drivers have been issued 20,437 summonses, and 755 cars have been towed.
Drivers have been greeting the new traffic era with anger, resignation and ingenuity. Dr. Patricio Paez, a psychiatrist who lives in Riverdale, the Bronx, and drives to his office on West End Avenue, plays Wagner "very loudly," he said, "when I'm stuck in construction for 30 minutes on the Henry Hudson Bridge."
He finds that his patients are complaining about traffic, too, "especially when they're late."
Josh Isaacson, a philosopher of traffic who is also a science teacher at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, has perfected dozens of back routes. One of his favorites is to "get to the airport while bypassing the worst of the East Side mess," he said. Mr. Isaacson takes the Central Park Drive from Central Park South, drives north to East 92d Street, exits the park and then heads up to the Triboro Bridge using Madison or Third Avenues, "whichever is less insane," he said.
Others are trying to avoid peak muddle times. "I'm thinking of working nights to avoid the traffic," said Mohammed Mushtaq, a 33-year-old cabdriver from Pakistan.
Good luck. Mr. Lynn said that these days there are more traffic jams later at night.
One reason? "Business is so good that many people are working very late," said Fred Solomon, director of client services for Executive Charge Inc., which launches 1,100 black cars a day into city traffic. "Our cars are busier, later, than ever before."

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Elegance Is Out -- And Chef Shuts Door

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Jean-Pierre Goyenvalle came to Washington in 1960, just before John F. Kennedy was elected, to take a job as the chef at the Rive Gauche, a French restaurant at a crossroads in Georgetown.
The city was about to begin a love affair with elegance, and especially, following the lead of Jacqueline Kennedy, with French elegance. Mr. Goyenvalle was in the right place at the right time, and the Rive Gauche became Camelot's chic dining spot. The food was haute cuisine, immaculately executed. 
 Almost 38 years later, elegance is out and informality is in. In Washington at least, formal French cooking has lost out to other culinary styles -- Mediterranean, Italian and fusion (and much of the time, confusion).
"People now seem to resent being asked to wear a coat and tie in a restaurant," the chef said. "They don't want to dress properly. Even Jean-Claude Vrinat, at Taillevent in Paris, told me it was hard for him to hold the line. But I think it affects the way people behave, how they are dressed."
So Mr. Goyenvalle, a stickler for tradition, is hanging up his toque, at least for now. Saturday was the last night at his third Washington restaurant, Le Lion d'Or, which he opened in 1976 as a successor to the smaller Jean-Pierre, to which he moved from Rive Gauche in 1971.
All were favorites of the city's elite, places where politicians, lawyers and lobbyists went to see and be seen, so Mr. Goyenvalle's retirement marks, in a way, the end of an era in the capital.
When he came, fish houses and steak joints were the beginning and the end of dining out here. Washington was a sleepy place, which President Kennedy described as having the efficiency of the South and the charm of the North. Now the city and its suburbs, more sophisticated, offer a vast choice.
"I did what I liked best," Mr. Goyenvalle said today, "and I think I pleased more people than most. Over the years, I changed with the times, I think, but I wasn't going to chase every fad. You can't produce a new dish every week, like dishwasher soap."
Le Lion d'Or's gastronomic reputation never flagged. It was rated as one of Washington's five best restaurants (and its best French place) last year by the Zagat guide, and for years it was one of a handful of American establishments that belonged to the French association called Traditions & Quality.
In October, readers of Gourmet magazine voted it one of the three best in town.
The oysters in champagne sabayon with caviar, the beef with beef marrow and the trademark chocolate souffle all still tasted terrific. To those who kept coming, the striped silk walls were as pretty as ever and the silken service from Francois, everyone's favorite waiter, was as reassuring as ever.
But Washington's reputation as a violent, crime-ridden city kept a lot of potential suburban customers in the suburbs. The recession of 1991 was severe in Washington, and hard to ride out for a restaurant with a staff of 50 at its peak and 25 at the end. Federal limits on the deductability of expense-account lunches hurt, and so did changing drinking habits, especially at lunch.
"Finally I gave up lunch," Mr. Goyenvalle said. "I saw days when we had 50 people come in, and I only sold one glass of wine. No bottles. It's not easy to make a living on people eating salads and drinking Perrier."
This fall, the lease came up for renewal. The restaurant obviously needed to have some money put into it, and the dinner business just wasn't good enough to justify it. At 60, Mr. Goyenvalle decided it was time to go.
All last week, other chefs came to dinner to pay their respects. Whole tables of them ate, drank and swapped stories until late at night. Patrick O'Connell and Reinhardt Lynch, who run the celebrated Inn at Little Washington in Washington, Va., near the Skyline Drive, said they hoped to buy a few things when the restaurant's furnishings and wines are auctioned next month.
Then last night the longstanding clients came -- 150 of them.
"It was a circus," Mr. Goyenvalle said this morning. "With the dining room full and 20 in the private room, it was hard to cook and harder to serve. I survived, only barely. But they were all friends, and almost no one complained. The ones who did complain, we told them, 'So don't come back, then.' "

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Round Table With Opponents of Racial Preferences

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
On Friday, President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore met for more than an hour in the Oval Office for a discussion on race with nine critics of affirmative action. The nine were invited after a Presidential advisory panel on race was criticized for ignoring conservative views. Following are excerpts from the meeting, as transcribed by the White House. The New York Times published a briefer version on Saturday. 
 CLINTON -- I think what I'd like to do to begin is just to hear from you. I'd like to -- on the question of, 'Do you believe that race still matters in America and is still a problem in some ways?' And if so, instead of our getting into a big fight about affirmative action -- although if you want to discuss it, we can -- what bothers me is that even I, who think it works in some ways, believe it works only when people -- it works predominantly for people who are at least in a position for it to work. A lot of the people that I care most about are totally unaffected by it one way or the other. . . .
CONNERLY -- Yes, there is a problem in America. It's a serious problem. It's one that's complex, multidimensional. It doesn't lend itself to government solution in many cases. But we can't get to the problem of moving this nation forward with respect to the issue of race unless we deal with the perception by a large number of people that there are preferences that are being given to people simply because they check a box and then benefits are conferred on the basis of checking that box.
And the language here is very important. You said in June of this year that we need to have an honest dialogue. Well, up until this point, frankly, many of us think the dialogue has been less than honest from some of those who try to defend what they call affirmative action. I don't want to end all affirmative action, but I want to add every preference that I can find that's based on some trait over which I have no control. And if I want that for myself, I want it for other people as well. So I don't think, sir, that we can have this dialogue today, which is perhaps one of our best shots at getting our point of view across, without talking about the----
CLINTON -- What do you think we should do? Since there are -- since various racial minorities are represented in groups of people that are at least not doing very well in this society, in numbers disproportionate to their numbers in the country as a whole, how should we respond to that?
CONNERLY -- I think that choice -- school choice is one way to respond to it. I think if we overhaul the K-12 system, which is one way to respond to it. They're trying to do that in California by lowering classroom sizes. We're looking at testing. We're looking at the quality of the teachers. We also have to start looking at ourselves. Are we telling our kids as parents that education is as important as it should be?
So I think that there is a major change that needs to take place. But even if we don't make those changes, there is never, in my view, a rationale for discriminating against somebody on the basis of their skin color, regardless of what we want the outcome to be. . . .
 GARRETT -- When you said you wanted a conversation on race, we ought to -- not just this group -- but we all ought to talk about race and race relations. Affirmative action and mechanical programs will mean not a whit if we don't start changing attitudes. We don't know each other in this country. We don't know who lives next door to us in condominium buildings, let alone know about their concerns. And we have to, for a while, talk about race and not be bogged down by affirmative action discussion and debate.
Again, the courts will resolve that pretty much in part, but it just seems to me that the moral leadership that can be provided from this room and from all of us needs to be amplified. And one problem I have with my Republican and conservative brothers and sisters, no one ever wants to talk about race. No one ever wants to talk about the things that the people in Akron, my hometown, talked about -- the attitudes. You don't know what it's like to stand on a street corner dressed like this and a car comes up -- cluck, and locks the door. . . .
CHAVEZ -- I think that there are a lot of things we can do to reach those disadvantaged persons that you were talking about -- people who are socially, economically and educationally disadvantaged -- because that's who those programs were initially aimed at. . . .
I work at a place like the University of Maryland, which has in place a program not aimed at race, but aimed at students who are the first in their family to attend college. I would have been able to qualify for such a program. A lot of disadvantaged kids out there would. And once those children are identified, they're brought in a summer program; they're given tutoring and special classes in reading, writing and mathematics; they're given study skills; they're given counseling. They're told what courses they should take their first year; they attend a very structured first year.
Those kinds of programs would benefit people who are truly educationally and economically disadvantaged -- and more than just giving them a little badge and getting them to school, would help make sure that they get out of school, that they actually get that bachelor's degree, which is what none of the preference programs do. . . .
CLINTON -- The other day we had a group of African-American journalists in here. Every man in the crowd, to a person -- there were, like, 20 of them here -- every man in that office, every single solitary one, had been stopped by the police when he was doing nothing, for no reason other than the fact that he was black. And you say that's because there's a rational fear because of the fact that what occurs in some neighborhoods. Nonetheless, that is a race-based public policy. I'm just saying, it's not as simple as----
MS. THERNSTROM -- No, we agree with that. We agree with that. It's unacceptable to me.
MR. THERNSTROM -- But doesn't it happen in Detroit, in Atlanta, in other states where----
CLINTON -- All I'm saying is it's very difficult to get these things out of our society. . . .
Let me give you another example. Because of the -- a lot of work that's been done by a lot of people, there's been a dramatic increase in the capacity of the United States to limit the inflow of drugs into the country from the South by land and sea. But the consequence of that -- Mexico, which is a big, open country, has had enormous amounts of money invested there to try to undermine what little infrastructure there was to deter the influx of drugs. Five hundred million dollars was spent last year alone trying to bribe Mexican police.
Now, as a result, over half of the cocaine in the country comes across the Mexican border. So, all right, fast forward. What do you do if you're a local police officer with a drug problem? That's what this whole profiling is about -- inaudible people who are Hispanic if they're driving through town. That's an affirmative action program. That's a race-based affirmative action program. So how do you----
CHAVEZ -- But, Mr. President, some of us are opposed to that. I mean, Randall Kennedy has written, I think, very eloquently on exactly that issue. And those of us who oppose race preferences when they benefit groups are also opposed to them when they harm groups.
CLINTON -- If you were running a police force, and you were trying to figure out how to deal with the drug problem, and you had a lot of people who were coming through your town on an interstate, and you had a limited amount of resources, and you couldn't stop every car, which cars would you stop?
MS. THERNSTROM -- Every third car and come up with some of the criminals that way. I mean, I think police departments have to be held to the same standard that I want to see employers and universities and everybody else. I don't think we can make exceptions.
CANADY -- And it is inherently pernicious for our government to classify people on the basis of their race. And that sends a powerful message from the government to the people that we should judge one another on that basis. That's exactly the wrong thing for us to be saying. And that is the sort of government policy that reinforces a prejudice in our society and keeps us -- instead of going in the right direction toward unity, it keeps us caught in this dilemma that we are in now.
Our suggestion is that we've just got to get the government out of this business. . . .
GORE -- Could I ask a question, Mr. President? If you lived in a community that was 50 percent white, 50 percent black, and for a variety of historic reasons the level of income, educational attainment and so forth was lower among the blacks in that community, and the police force was 100 percent white, and the problems of the kind that we all deplore took place and other problems took place, and the community decided that the police force would be better able to do its job if blacks were much more represented on the police force, because then the police force would have a much greater ability to relate to the community effectively and to do its job -- under those circumstances, do you think that the community would be justified in making affirmative action efforts to open up a lot more positions on the police force for blacks?
CANADY -- Let me say two things in response to that. Number one, I believe in community policing. I actually supported the President's crime bill back in the first Congress I was here. And I believe that the concept of community policing is important. One thing that you can do to have effective community policing is require that the people who are involved in that live in the communities they police. Now, that's the kind of policy I can support. You don't have to classify people based on their race to do that and to be effective in community policing.
But this idea that we should hire people because they're going to be more -- based on their race because they're going to be more sensitive to certain -- and more acceptable to certain people that they're serving can be replicated in our history in the South when people -- employers said, well, I'd like to hire some black people, but my customers wouldn't accept that. That is offensive. It was more than offensive, it was morally wrong. And I would suggest to you for the government to classify people -- even in such a context as that -- simply based on their race is morally offensive and inconsistent with our constitutional traditions.
GORE -- Of course, I strongly disagree with you. And it seems to me that the case that I've described there presents a really obvious example of how the community as a whole would be better off and the effectiveness of the police force would be enhanced. And to say that it's -- that's there's nothing to the idea that a police force with black representation on the force would have an easier time relating to the black community is, I think, to deny the obvious. . . .
CANADY -- There are some people that contend that you have to take race into account in undercover police work. The theory is that you need black people to serve as undercover agents, and that's the only effective way that can be carried out. Well, you know, it's very interesting that the Drug Enforcement Administration actually had a policy of doing that. And the black drug enforcement agent sued the drug enforcement agency over that very policy because it was discriminating against them. It was putting them in contexts where they were at greater risk, and it was limiting their opportunities for advancement. So what may start out as making some sense from one perspective can end up harming the very people that supposedly will benefit.
CLINTON -- You don't quarrel with the fact that, other things being equal, in cities that had a racially diverse -- it would be a good thing if it could be done without race preferences to have a diverse police department.
CANADY -- Absolutely. I think we ought to have a police department that can work with----
CLINTON -- But you just said that you like this whole idea of -- that's what we're doing now at HUD. We're actually encouraging police officers to go out and live in the neighborhoods where inaudible let them buy houses for half price if they'll serve in the neighborhoods where they live. . . .
What I think we have to do is to figure out -- I think part of this problem will go away if we ask ourselves, are the criteria by which we are making this decision, whatever this decision is, really relevant. Are we really -- whether it's college admission -- are we keeping score in the right way here?
But it seems to me that we have a vested interest in the objectives. If we agree that we need an integrated police department, and that it would be better----
MR. THERNSTROM -- We'd like to have an integrated police department.
CLINTON -- ----that we would like to have one, and that our society would function better if we had one, then we should ask ourselves, O.K., how are we going to get there?
CHAVEZ -- But, Mr. President, with all due respect to the Vice President, the example he gave, I don't think you could find me a concrete example of such a place in urban America today. I've looked at the statistics. I don't have them off the top of my head, but I've written columns on this and I have looked them up, and statistics show that there are significant numbers of black and Hispanic police officers.
GORE -- Partly because of affirmative action.
CHAVEZ -- It may not be proportional representation, but it is close to proportional. What I would look at is first and foremost, are you discriminating in that police department? And I think every person in this room is adamantly in favor of vigorous enforcement of the civil rights law. And sure, there are employers out there, including public employers, who discriminate. And we have to root out that kind of discrimination.
And then you do engage in outreach. You do create training programs. You do go into high schools and try and recruit people and get them ready so that they will be able to be prepared to take the test to become a police officer. . . .
MR. THERNSTROM -- But I do question the need for diversity defined narrowly in terms of skin color. I mean, I live in an almost all white community, so are we saying that the people of Lexington feel more comfortable being policed by whites, and there's some terrific black Africans for the police force, sorry, you go back to Roxbury, or something, we don't like your color? And I can think of communities with large numbers of Asians, but where Asian families are very strongly oriented turning out physicists and physicians, and the like, and not very interested in law enforcement.
Now, the notion that some large element of the population have no one in that kind of position is perhaps repellent, but once we start thinking of, well, 28 percent Asians -- got to be pretty close to 28 percent -- I think that -- and for that matter, I mean, after all, half the population is female. Should half of all our police forces be female? . . .
GARRETT -- One of the things I'm doing -- and I'm based here in Washington and just stepped down as the chairman of the board of Howard University, and this semester have been teaching a course at Harvard University in the Kennedy School on the politics of race. One of the things, though, I'm going to do in Akron, where I go to on weekends, is build a $2 million family life center in the heart of the ghetto, and get Jewish rabbis and Jewish synagogues to come in with me on this project, so that on the black side we can try to work on this ill feeling toward Jews. This is not being done in Washington. It's not being done with Federal money. It's being done in the locality . . .
We all know the government cannot impose upon the media in this country. But one of the things your Advisory Council may want to do is convene some meetings in a very nice and positive way with media people and remind them that they are a great part of this attitude, effect. A woman out in Virginia six months ago had six black babies, sextuplets. Never got mentioned anywhere. Didn't get a dime from any corporation, diapers or anything. Then this woman out in Iowa has seven and she's in more magazines than you are.
Now, you're going to tell me that there's not something inherently wrong with that? And it wasn't until some of us ministers kicked up a fuss that now some of the corporations are starting. These are the kinds of things that affect people's attitudes.
CONNERLY -- The threshold is seven.
GARRETT -- Because it was close.
MS. THERNSTROM -- But, you know, there isn't anybody in this room who would deny that we've got a long ways to go down the road to racial equality. And there's nobody in this room who would deny that there's a lot of racism still in this society. I mean, the question from me is the trend lines. Have we been walking in the right direction, and do we continue to walk in the right direction? And those trend lines look very good. And I think that one of the things we need to do in having a decent racial dialogue is not only to get beyond race, but also to get beyond emoting over race. And there is much too much emoting and there is much too much name-calling, as well. . . .
And a lot of what we know is simply denied about how far we have come. If you can get the landscape right, then you can say, look, we have the following problems still: 27 percent of black families still in poverty. That's not much different than 1970. That's a catastrophic problem. We still have -- we have a racial gap in academic performance such that black kids in 12th grade are reading on the average four years behind white and Asian kids. That stacks the deck against those kids for the rest of their lives.
The solution to that isn't preferences; the solution -- and the solution to the police force -- we'll have a diverse police force tomorrow if we can close that gap in academic performance such that you've got -- so that you give police exams and there is no racial disparity. I think, Mr. President, you've said some wonderful things on education. I'd like to push you further on them. But to me, that is absolutely the key.
CLINTON -- I do, too. I think what Chicago has done, tells everybody that you've got to go to summer school if you don't measure up and if you don't measure up a second time, you can't go ahead -- your self-esteem will be hurt more when you're 50 and you can't read than when you're 16 and you have to stay back another year. I think that's great. . . .
CHAO -- There's stories upon stories of immigrants who come to this country with no experience of being an American, who don't speak the language, who don't understand the culture, and what they really want is just an equal opportunity. And what happens when that equal opportunity is no longer a level playing field, but with the best of intentions it's being turned into something that is unfair to them?
Right now, for example, your administration is talking a great deal about changing standards -- college admission standards. . . .
I went to Harvard, and I was kicked off of the Harvard Alumni Board. And for an Asian American that's a big admission. We don't get kicked very many -- at least we don't admit it. But at Harvard, Asian-Americans are an over-represented minority as they are in many, many college and universities.
MS. THERNSTROM -- Eighteen percent ----
CHAO -- And if you are to -- that's still an over-representation because we're only two percent of the population. So we're way over. And what happens is if you're a white child going to Harvard, you have 17 percent chance; if you are African American, you have almost 30 percent chance; if you are a Latino American, 25 percent chance; if you're an Asian American child, you have an 11 percent----
And so for all those new immigrants who come here and work so hard, they find that the rules are being changed all the time. First of all, you have to get involved in extracurricular activities. Oh, great -- O.K. So now Asian-American parents have caught on and they're getting all their kids to be yearbook editors, doing all this -- now, they're changing it to where they need leadership qualities. What does that mean -- leadership qualities? . . .
CONNERLY -- The one hopeful thing that I wanted from this dialogue about race was structure. We've been talking about it, certainly my state now, for about four years, in a very intense way, the University of California and with Proposition 209. But all too often there is no structure to it. It's ad hominem attacks. It's questioning the motives of people. . . .
We have to stop calling each other names, stop questioning the motives. And I submit to you, sir, that one thing that might help move this panel forward is to take the whole subject of affirmative action off their plate. Let them deal with the broader subject of race absent the issue of preferences, because we're not going to solve that one anyway.
And as a result of the belief that many of us have that the panel is not objectively constructed, to be candid with you, it's fun to pollute all of the other things that they might do. So my suggestion, respectfully, is to just take that out of their hands.
The second thing is I think that the time frame that is self-imposed ought to be extended because the ball has been fumbled a little bit, candidly, until now, and the discussion is just now getting -- beginning to happen in earnest. And if it comes to an end on June 4, I think that's going to be premature, candidly.
So I would strongly suggest that you extend it another six months or so, so that the debate can unfold in the fullness of time as it seems not to be unfolding.
MS. THERNSTROM -- But the board itself is so monolithic in its voice, and as far as I can tell -- I mean, yes, Lisa Graham Keegan was there yesterday and William Bennett was there yesterday, but those were exceptions. And for instance Gary Orfield was there saying, once again that schools are more segregated than ever before, which I regard as junk social science. I mean, it's just not sustained by the data.
MR. THERNSTROM -- He defines a segregated school as one that's 25 percent Asian, 25 percent black, 25 percent Hispanic, 25 percent white -- you need a white majority school for it to be not segregated. And that's backwards. The tables of his latest report are all defined in terms of ----
MS. THERNSTROM -- But there needs to be -- there are two camps, there needs to be a spectrum of scholarly voices. . . .
 GARRETT -- But, Abigail, you're sitting in the Oval Office of the land with the President listening to you. Now, what I would like to know, as a lifelong Republican conservative -- some days, some days not -- if you want to use those silly terms -- what are you going to do? Don't tell me about studies and figures. Fine. Let us all acknowledge those. But it doesn't help one bit to write books, to write studies, and the people are still milling around suffering.
This President deserves to have the concrete recommendations. Asian Americans, what's to keep them from having dialogue and building centers with blacks and Jews and others? You see, you talk about this, but I have seen precious few who are against affirmative action get out there and start something. . . .

HEADLINE: Saddam Hussein's Friends Drop By in Pilgrimage of Support

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Saddam Hussein may be an international pariah in some quarters, but an eclectic mix of visitors has made the pilgrimage to Baghdad in recent weeks to express solidarity with the Iraqi leader.
Russia's vociferous nationalist, Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, was here this month. A delegation from France's Parliament has paid its respects. And Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, delivered an impassioned appeal for an end to the United Nations trade sanctions that was greeted with shouts of "Down, down with America!" 
 Travel to Baghdad, of course, is no easy matter. A United Nations ban on air flights to the country remains in effect, and visitors faces an arduous 16-hour drive from Jordan by bus or car. Most end up at Al Rashid Hotel, where the lobby's marble floor is still decorated with a tiled mosaic likeness of former President Bush emblazoned with the slogan "George Bush, criminal."
One recent evening, the hotel pianist played "Strangers in the Night" as scowling Russians and robed Persian Gulf sportsmen carrying blindfolded hunting falcons rubbed shoulders with about 20 members of Mr. Farrakhan's entourage, some dressed in black leather coats, high-top sneakers and gold chains.
Mr. Bush's portrait presented an opportunity some of the visitors found irresistible. Mr. Zhirinovsky, for example, stamped his feet on it, largely for the benefit of a CNN camera crew.
In the seven years since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Western allies have largely maintained the diplomatic isolation of Baghdad. But there have been other, less formal ties to the outside world.
Indonesian, German and Pakistani businessmen are here, exchanging business cards and looking forward to the day when the sanctions end. Several delegations of Americans have come to Iraq to deliver antibiotics, which remain in short supply.
The visitors to Baghdad seem impervious to recent political developments, which include President Hussein's standoff with United Nations weapons inspectors.
The official visits to Iraq are exhaustively covered by the state-controlled media. Recently, Ahmed bin Jassem al-Thania, a Qatari sheik who is head of his country's royal guard, met with President Hussein to convey what the Iraqi press later called "brotherly relations."
Mr. Farrakhan's reception was more elaborate. A group of Bedouin poets sang his praises before he began his speech at the Rashid theater, a modern building in the heart of Baghdad.
His ringing plea for solidarity among the world's Muslims was translated phrase by phrase into Arabic. Some women in the audience responded with the high-pitched cry traditionally used to express happiness or celebration.
The next day, the Iraqi daily Al Thawra praised his visit for strengthening the ties between American and Iraqi Muslims.
The Persian Gulf war disrupted the longstanding alliance between Iraq and Russia, and Mr. Zhirinovsky, a vocal critic of Russia's ties to the West, suggested that it was time to reinvigorate the Baghdad-Moscow relationship.
He met with President Hussein and other senior officials. At a news conference, he underscored his solidarity with Iraqis, brushing aside a British journalist's question with the comment, "You speak the language of the aggressor."

HEADLINE: Facing Up to Global Warming

 BODY:
The global warming accord was barely signed in Kyoto, Japan, earlier this month when critics pronounced its chances of Senate ratification to be nil. If that is true, then the Senate has clearly misread the American public, which in every survey has expressed an appetite for decisive action. The Senate's attitude also defines what could be President Clinton's biggest challenge in the new year -- leading the Senate where the public wants it to go.
Few scientists doubt that the warming of the earth's atmosphere, caused by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse-gas emissions, poses a gigantic threat. But even before Kyoto, the Senate had voted 95 to 0 to reject any treaty that damaged the American economy or did not require developing countries to have their own energy conservation programs. The Kyoto agreement seems not to have satisfied many senators on either count. Mr. Clinton must therefore spend the next year enlisting the participation of developing countries and persuading Congress that the market incentives, tax credits and other strategies he has in mind will dramatically improve energy efficiency nationwide and allow America to meet its emissions targets without throttling the economy. 
 Getting the developing countries to sign up will not by itself carry the day in the Senate. At least 20 senators are unlikely to vote for the treaty under any circumstances, viewing the science as dubious or any kind of environmental regulation as offensive. The key to ratification will be the stance of such pro-environmental Republicans as John Chafee of Rhode Island, James Jeffords of Vermont and Olympia Snowe of Maine. In addition, Senators John McCain of Arizona and Richard Lugar of Indiana, both conservatives, have a record of sensitivity to American international obligations and down the road may well be persuaded to support the treaty, and bring others along.
American attitudes toward energy have changed since the 1970's, when gasoline lines and high prices gave sacrifice a bad name. Americans have also coalesced politically around supporting the environment. Senate and House Republican leaders learned that lesson painfully in 1995, when they tried and failed in their assaults on the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. In addition, as Mr. Clinton pointed out, every major environmental advance of recent years has been described as a potential economic disaster only to prove more doable than previously thought.
A two-thirds vote in the Senate is required for ratification. Millions of dollars will be spent by energy companies, agribusiness and labor unions to portray the Administration as bent on destroying the economy. Some Republicans are hoping to demonize the global warming treaty as they demonized Mr. Clinton's health care proposals in 1994. But it is also interesting that some Republicans have begun saying that they do not want to help Vice President Gore ride the environmental issue to the White House in 2000. That means they might be willing to support a treaty and share in the credit.
Any serious American effort to reduce greenhouse gases will require sacrifice. Even economists sympathetic to the environment warn against voluntarily bringing a repeat of the 1970's oil shock. The environmental movement would be making a mistake to belittle the anxiety Americans feel about such warnings. But critics of the treaty will make an even greater mistake if they underestimate the public's anxieties about global warming -- and their resolve to address it.

HEADLINE: Poor Oversight Said to Imperil World Banking

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH and RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Three years ago, when Thailand and South Korea were still considered economic miracles and no one but currency traders paid attention to the baht and the won, the United States' top banking regulator saw a looming crisis in Asia.
Eugene A. Ludwig, the Comptroller of the Currency, noticed disturbing parallels between banking practices in fast-growing Asian economies and the mess created in the United States by the deregulation and subsequent collapse of savings and loan associations. Along with deregulation in both cases came a flood of new money, reckless lending and inadequate Government supervision -- a clear recipe for a costly disaster. 
 But Mr. Ludwig's concerns -- passed along informally to a World Bank official at a 1994 meeting in Madrid -- were rare flags of caution at a time when international barriers to the flow of capital were fast disappearing, and investors and financial institutions were pouring money into rapidly developing countries in Asia and elsewhere.
If there is one clear lesson from the turmoil that has so badly jolted Asia, it is that the financial systems in many fast-growing countries were no match for the huge, skittish pools of money they attracted.
As they examine what went wrong in Asia, officials around the world see obvious parallels to past experiences like the American savings and loan debacle as well as complicated new problems.
National systems intended to supervise banks in their home countries have proven unable to keep pace with the rapid development of a global financial marketplace that pays little attention to borders.
There is no international body able to play the role of global regulator, and an inability by the United States and other powers to impose changes on the often-reluctant governments and banks in nations at risk.
And efforts to bolster the soundness of financial systems in Asia and elsewhere by encouraging greater disclosure of financial data and by prodding large international banks to demand changes have so far yielded little if any success.
A result is that to a remarkable extent, individual nations and even the worldwide economy are suddenly more at risk because of the ineffectiveness of obscure banking regulators in far-off countries.
South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia are among the countries paying a steep price for the problems with their banks, and Japan is scrambling to avoid the same fate; just last week Japan unveiled a $77 billion plan to shore up its financial institutions. The ripples have crossed the Pacific, unsettling Wall Street, hurting exporters and potentially curbing economic growth in the United States.
"In the early 1980's the U.S. confused deregulation with supervision, and the same thing happened in Asia," said Charles Bowsher, the former head of the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. "You pay a very big price, as we did in 1929 and the 1980's in this country, and what we're now seeing in Asia."
With the International Monetary Fund taking the lead, multinational organizations and national governments have pledged more than $100 billion to bail out countries in Asia, the largest international rescue in history. Yet, paradoxically, there is no global body with the ability or the mandate to manage the problem.
Individual countries monitor what their banks do at home and abroad, and what foreign banks do on their turf. But if central banks and national regulatory agencies can take individual snapshots, no organization is responsible for a global perspective.
The principal body for coordinating international bank regulation -- a committee of worldwide regulators operating under the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland -- has made little progress until now in getting countries like Korea of Thailand to upgrade their standards.
Even the I.M.F., which has only recently been thrust into the front lines of the battle to shore up weakened banking systems, is a reluctant savior.
"The amount of detailed knowledge it takes to understand a system is beyond the capacity of a single multinational organization to deal with," said Stanley Fischer, the I.M.F.'s first deputy managing director.
The problem is not new. The collapse of big, international financial institutions like the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in 1991 and Barings P.L.C. in 1994 showed the vulnerabilities in the system of supervising multinational banks.
But the stakes now are often much higher, involving not individual banks but entire economies. And while the I.M.F., other multinational bodies and national governments are willing to come to the rescue, they lack the crucial power that usually goes hand-in-hand with status as lender of last resort -- the ability to demand changes, before crisis hits, in a bank's management.
"In the last few years we've come to realize -- and you may say it's late -- that banking system stability is more important for a wider range of countries," said Andrew Crockett, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements.
"It's the public sector, whose money is on the line, that prevents a financial meltdown, so the public sector has to have a voice," Mr. Crockett said. "How can we get these countries to adopt these standards? The answer is you can't."
The limits of sovereignty concern bankers and others in the private sector, as well.
"National supervision of complex global firms and global markets is inadequate to meet the requirements of the times," said John G. Heimann, the chairman for global financial institutions at Merrill Lynch.
The solution, according to a recent study by private and public sector experts for which Mr. Heimann was co-chairman, is that major financial institutions, in cooperation with supervisors, must take the lead in reducing global financial risk.
"The speed and complexity of innovation in the markets, the supervisors' inevitable position 'behind the curve' and their real handicaps in competing for talented staffers all argue for private institutions to take on greater responsibility," the study found.
The study's conclusions, which were supported by top officials of some of the world's largest financial institutions, including Citibank, Deutsche Bank, Nomura Bank International and Credit Lyonnais, were made public just as the crisis in Asia was emerging this year. But it is unclear whether the private sector will take on such a crucial role.
In South Korea, for instance, large Japanese, European and American banks may have been part of the problem rather than part of the solution. They were among the financial institutions most exposed to huge losses by South Korea's woes, suggesting that they too missed warnings signs and are in some ways the beneficiaries of Korea's $60 billion bailout package.
Meanwhile, governments, including the United States', have been expending much political capital and exerting considerable effort to get other countries to open up their financial markets to the Merrill Lynches of the world.
Just recently the World Trade Organization, after long negotiations, concluded a financial services pact that further opens up the banking, securities and insurance industries in scores of nations. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin wrote the head of the W.T.O. in August to "underscore our view that financial liberalization and the maintenance of financial stability are mutually reinforcing."
Mr. Rubin wrote of the "need to develop and maintain strong supervisory regimes and regulatory infrastructures" as the Asian financial crisis was in its first stages.
Some Asians feel that such a message should have been delivered earlier and more forcefully.
The United States, acting at the behest of American banks, pressed South Korea to open its financial markets a few years ago, but Washington "didn't help the Korean Government prepare for these things -- it went too fast," said Yoon Dae Euh, a professor of international finance at Korea University and former member of Seoul's Monetary Board.
In some ways the United States may even have contributed to undermining the discipline of the international financial institutions that poured money into South Korea. Washington strongly backed the entry of South Korea in 1996 into the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the elite club of industrial nations. Membership is largely symbolic, but it carries with it certain perks, among them an assumption, under rules developed by the Bank for International Settlements committee, that bank loans to members carry no risk of default.
So South Korea's entry into the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development may have helped give the marketplace a false sense of confidence about South Korea, according to banking experts and an I.M.F. official.
Between 1994, when South Korea received its first green light for membership, and 1996, when it officially joined, foreign banks more than doubled their lending to South Korea, from $52 billion to $108 billion, according to Bank for International Settlements reports.
While organization membership requires open financial markets, it does not require sound financial supervision.
"We ought to strive for higher standards, maybe even hand in glove with O.E.C.D. membership," said Mr. Ludwig. Asia, he added, "shows that the importance of sound and good regulation is much more a factor today than it has ever been before."
But if governments and international organizations find it hard to strengthen such systems, the solution, according to policymakers like Mr. Rubin and regulators like Mr. Crockett, is to rely on market pressure.
However the problem gets addressed, no one thinks it will be a quick, easy task.
"This is not a one- or three-year job, it is a five-year or ten0-year job," Mr. Crockett said.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Berlin Wall, Part 2

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Watching the recent political developments in Southeast Asia reminded me of a conversation I had last month with an American executive in Moscow. The U.S. businessman told me he had been approached by a Russian who was interested in setting up a joint venture. The American asked the Russian one question: Do you pay your taxes? No? Well, said the American, if you don't pay your taxes, we can't be partners because we're a public company; if one of our subsidiaries doesn't pay its taxes, it shows in our annual audit. So the Russian now has a choice: pay his taxes in Moscow or miss out partnering with a cutting-edge U.S. firm.
The integration of global markets, information and standards has many downsides, and the financial contagion spreading through Asia today is one. But one of integration's most powerful upsides is its ability to foster political change, and that is also happening in Asia today. We are now witnessing Southeast Asia's equivalent of the fall of the Berlin wall. The Communists in Europe had to take their Berlin walls down to get into the globalization game. The capitalists in Asia are being forced to take their economic Berlin walls down to stay in the game. 
 The crony capitalism practiced in Southeast Asia -- with banks, bureaucrats and business linked together, directed from above and shrouded in secrecy -- had a certain Soviet quality, as the economist Paul Krugman first noted. It may have been useful for early development, but it became a liability as these countries integrated into today's global economy. In an increasingly fast, complicated and interconnected world, centralized control doesn't work so well. The center can't know enough to keep up, which leads to misallocated resources and inefficient practices.
So, at the depths of Asia's economic crisis, Thailand passes a new Constitution requiring more open decision-making, more accountability from ministers and more democratic governance. South Korea elects as its new President Kim Dae Jung, the country's leading pro-democracy crusader, who vows to "open a new age of democratic economic order that respects market mechanisms and competition." Malaysia's conservative, nationalistic leader, Mohamed Mahathir, has had to defer to his more liberal Finance Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, to get out of this crisis.
"The answer to this crisis" is to link Malaysia even more to global systems and standards, "not less," Mr. Ibrahim told me. "No other option can satisfy the needs and demands of Malaysia's people. We can't have a multi-media supercorridor here and then say that there should be no liberalization of our financial sector. We can't have an uncensored media and then say no to democracy. You can't reverse this game. We have opened our market, and lowered taxes, to encourage foreign investors to come in, and we have to deal with it. If we told people we were going back to subsistence life, there would be a revolution."
I call this phenomenon "Globalution." You have a generation coming of age in Southeast Asia who want affluence, but don't want to be corrupt, and who want more democracy, but are afraid to go into the streets. They doubt there will ever be revolution from above. They fear revolution from below. So their whole strategy is revolution from beyond. They want to link their countries in every way they can to the powerful forces of globalization -- from the Internet to global businesses and international human rights N.G.O.'s -- hoping that these forces will import change, and rule of law, which won't come from above or below. I wish everyone could come to democracy by reading Madison, but sometimes the push has to come from Merrill Lynch. Kim Dae Jung got his start in Korea fighting the secret police. But he just got elected President to fight the secret banks.
Are trade, financial integration and the Internet enough to produce democracy in these countries? Of course not. They are necessary, but not sufficient. Ultimately, you can't have democracy without democrats. But the fact is global markets today are demanding, in return for their investments, the rule of law, transparency, predictability, competition and pluralism in financial affairs. And it is precisely these pressures for better governance in finance that the democrats can build upon for their political goals. That's exactly what's happening in Thailand, Malaysia and Korea. Soon it will be China's turn.

A Generous Country

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The immigration law passed by Congress in 1996 has had harsh effects on some individuals: visitors barred at our borders, aliens marked for deportation after living here legally for many years. I discussed the issues with the principal House sponsor of the law, Representative Lamar S. Smith, Republican of Texas.
"America should continue to be the most generous country in the world toward immigrants," Mr. Smith said. "I think they have much to contribute to this country." 
 The 1996 act, he said, was designed to deal with people who do not deserve to be here, such as those who enter illegally. But it was not intended to deny anyone fair treatment.
"There is no excuse for anybody being treated unjustly," he said. "Justice is one of the things that makes this country great, and rightly attracts people here, along with economic opportunity and freedom."
What about instances, I asked, where the Immigration and Naturalization Service has admitted that its officers mistreated individuals at the border? The Commissioner of Immigration, Doris Meissner, has said that about several cases described in this column in recent months.
"It's not the fault of the law," Mr. Smith replied. "It's the fault of the I.N.S.
"When you have hundreds of millions of entries every year, and you have human nature involved, there are inevitably going to be some lapses. That doesn't excuse them. I hope it won't be interpreted as rationalizing any kind of insensitivity. It is simply a comment on what is a fact of life."
One provision of the 1996 act, called "expedited removal," allows I.N.S. agents to keep out anyone they think is trying to enter the country improperly, even if the person has a U.S. visa, and bar him for five years. I asked whether that didn't encourage hasty, sometimes unfair decisions.
Mr. Smith said he had been to two border checkpoints in the last several months and found the border patrol agents "enthusiastic" about the provision. "I think on the whole it's reducing the abuses," he said, "the gaming of the system."
The new law's process for dealing with applicants for political asylum is also working well, he said. It requires someone who claims to be fleeing persecution first to persuade an asylum officer at the border that he or she has a "credible fear," then to have an asylum hearing before an immigration judge.
"The asylum officers are getting some good training," Mr. Smith said. "Almost 90 percent of people asking for asylum are being found to have a credible fear. When you have that high a level of initial acceptance of their claims, clearly the officers are giving people the benefit of the doubt."
Since it was human nature for the I.N.S. to make some mistakes, I asked, why had the new statute in many areas stripped away the right to judicial review of the agency's decisions?
"Judicial review," he said, "encouraged many of the people who are in this country illegally" by allowing them to contest their deportation endlessly. He said there were about five million, with the number growing by 300,000 a year.
The 1996 law also made legal immigrants deportable because of minor crimes committed years ago, and removed their right to seek a waiver of deportation. A notable case is that of Jesus Collado, a Brooklyn man who faces deportation because he slept with a 15-year-old girlfriend 23 years ago and was put on probation for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He has lived a blameless life since and has an American wife and three children.
"In the vast majority of cases I think the crimes do justify deportation," Mr. Smith commented. "However, perhaps around the far edges the I.N.S. should have some discretion in these cases.
"First I'd like to be reassured that the Administration is serious about deporting hardened criminals. It has a program to deport those currently in prison when they finish their sentences, but it is deporting less than 50 percent."
The Collado case, he said, "obviously tugs at your heart. Clearly this is an instance where humanitarian considerations should be taken into account. I believe in redemption, and I believe it should be granted generously.
"The question is how you do that without creating a giant loophole through which thousands of others can escape deportation."

HEADLINE: U.S. Should Help Turkey Enter Europe

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Turkish Wrongs and Rights" (editorial, Dec. 18) attacks the European Union for hidden prejudice in rejecting Turkey as a member in the near future, although the rest of your editorial seems to sustain legitimate reasons for doing so. You say Turkey's human rights problems are solvable, and I agree. However, it seems wiser to delay making any commitments to admit Turkey. 
 The issue of what form Islam will take in Turkey's future is far from resolved. Will it be a modern form that accepts the separation of religion and state, or will it be a more classic form that requires a state legitimacy based on religion?
Will Turkey learn to practice real tolerance toward its Kurdish minority? Will it ever acknowledge the Armenian genocide? Will it end the partition of Cyprus? Will Turkey resolve its mineral and oil disputes with Greece?
Moreover, German concern about a large influx of Turks seems legitimate. Germany is suffering from unemployment over 10 percent and has yet to resolve the status of its minority groups. With a relatively high birthrate, Turkey could prove difficult for the E.U. to integrate without Turkey's achieving a higher living standard.

 BODY:
Fr the first time in more than seven years, New Jersey's unemployment rate dipped below 5 percent last month to 4.9 percent, according to a report released Friday by the State Department of Labor. 
 The unemployment rate, down from 5.2 percent in October, has not been as low since June 1990, before the state's economic recession began, said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for the department.
New Jersey gained 8,500 new jobs in November, reaching a new high of 3.7 million jobs, the report said.

HEADLINE: Joined for Life, and Living Life to the Full

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER 

DATELINE: READING, Pa.

 BODY:
LIKE many twins descended from a single egg whom the world has deemed "identical," Lori and Reba Schappell prefer to emphasize their differences over their similarities.
Lori is warm and boisterous and maternal. She wants to get married and have babies, she says, and at the age of 36, she wants to do it soon. Reba is quiet and self-contained, and she squirms whenever her sister hugs her in public or tells her that she loves her. Reba is focused on her fledgling career as a country singer. Earlier this month, she flew to California to accept an L.A. Music Award for best new country artist of the year. 
 Lori keeps her brown hair short, speaks with the broad-voweled accent of the Reading area, where the sisters have always lived, and loves strawberry daiquiris. Reba colors her wavy hair copper, has adopted a Nashville twang and is a teetotaler.
But there are certain things the sisters undeniably share. They are, literally, of one flesh. They are conjoined at the head, portions of their skull, scalp and blood vessels fused at the side in a mirror-image configuration, so that they face in opposite directions. And though they have two distinct brains, they are of one mind in their opinion about whether they would ever consider undertaking the risks of surgical separation.
"Our point of view is no, straight-out no," said Reba, for the moment not the "quiet" one. "Why would you want to do that? For all the money in China, why? You'd be ruining two lives in the process."
"And we'd miss the other one horribly if she were to die," Lori added.
Reba and Lori live a life that no singleton can imagine, and one that looks unbearably difficult. Where one goes, so must the other. Reba is short and cannot walk for herself, and so her sister wheels her around on a bar stool. They venture out in the world fearlessly, and the world never stops staring at the sight of them. But as they see it, their lives are no more difficult than all lives.
"There are good days and bad days -- so what?" says Reba. "This is what we know. We don't hate it. We live it every day. I don't sit around questioning it, or asking myself what I could do differently if I were separated."
Nor does Lori appreciate being held up as an exemplar of fortitude. "People come up to me and say, 'You're such an inspiration. Now I realize how minor my own problems are compared to yours.' But they have no idea what problems I have or don't have, or what my life is like."
The attitudes of the Schappell sisters are strongly felt, but not unique. As Alice D. Dreger, a historian of anatomy at Michigan State University in East Lansing, argues in a new and detailed analysis of the medical treatment of conjoined twins, the assumption among surgeons, the public and most parents, that life as a conjoined twin is not worth living, and that separation should be tried in nearly every case, whatever the risks, is an outsider's premise, and one in need of some serious scrutiny.
Writing in the current issue of a new journal called Studies in History and Philosophy of Science, Dr. Dreger reviews cases in which surgeons have aggressively sought to separate conjoined twins even when the distribution of shared organs resulted in the extreme disability or death of one. She points out that throughout history, conjoined twins who reached adulthood have expressed satisfaction with their linked lives.
 
An Ethical Dilemma
Sacrificing One To Save the Other
Consider the case of Mary and Eliza Chulhurst, one of the first documented examples of conjoined twins. Born fused at the lower back and buttocks in the year 1100, the Chulhurst sisters -- also known as the Biddenden Maids -- lived for 34 years in Kent, England. After the death of one sister, doctors urged the survivor to allow them to attempt surgical separation to save her. She refused, declaring, "As we came together, we will go together." She died several hours later.
Yet despite the testimony of twins themselves, Dr. Dreger argues, doctors persist in regarding conjoined twins -- also known by the now-disfavored term, Siamese twins -- as monstrously abnormal beings who must be individuated surgically, even if such standard mores of medicine as "first do no harm" are set aside to do so. She explores at length the disturbing ethics that surrounded the widely publicized case of Angela and Amy Lakeberg, born in 1993. The girls were attached breast to belly, sharing a liver and a single, six-chambered heart, rather than two four-chambered ones. Because the infants had no chance of survival in their conjoined state, the parents opted for a long-shot effort to save one of the twins at the expense of the other.
In an extraordinary operation, a team of surgeons at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia cut off circulation to Amy, deliberately "sacrificing" her to salvage the heart for Angela. The effort ultimately failed, and Angela died 10 months later, but the doctors involved, as well as many others, have maintained that it was better to try to rescue one twin rather than allow both to die.
Yet, as Dr. Dreger argues in her new report, if the twins had been born separate, and the health of both were failing, nobody would have proposed that one sickly twin should be killed and her organs harvested for the sake of the other's survival.
"That we would go so far as to intentionally asphyxiate a conscious head, and kill one of the twins in order to make a singleton out of them just astonished me," Dr. Dreger said in a telephone interview. "There was much ethical discussion at the time about the cost of the operation, but very little about whether or not this was morally right."
As Dr. Dreger sees it, the willingness in this case to forfeit one young life for another bespeaks society's extreme discomfort with its outliers, those who in the past would have been called freaks and exhibited at circus sideshows, but who today are often the objects of elaborate and heroicized surgical interventions. The implications of how conjoined twins are treated go beyond the rare condition, which occurs in about one in 50,000 to one in 100,000 births.
 
'The Treatment Train'
Easy to Hop On, Hard to Get Off
Dr. Dreger and others who share her views see parallels between medical attitudes toward conjoined twins, and toward those children born with other anomalies, including ambiguous genitals, dwarfism, congenital deafness, and the like. Such conditions have invited aggressive attempts at fixing, often through a long series of operations, medications and rehabilitations; and most have required that the therapies be performed on children too young to have a say in whether they want to be treated or not.
"There's an allurement called the treatment train," said Dr. David C. Thomasma, director of the medical humanities program at Loyola University Chicago Medical Center. "You hop on, but it's very hard to get off. The power of the medical model today to shape our decisions is enormous." Dr. Thomasma is an author of a paper that appeared last year in the Hastings Center report about the Lakeberg twin case. Like Dr. Dreger, he was disturbed by the ease with which Amy Lakeberg's life was taken. "I remember during all the debates how quickly people who wanted to intervene could move into the idea that one twin was like a parasite or an appendage -- language that makes one morally able to divide them."
The conjoined twins conundrum is part of a larger tension now underlying America's attitude toward what might be called "differency." On the one hand, antidiscrimination laws have had a real impact, allowing disabled people who might once have spent their lives in seclusion to work, take public transportation and just generally be visible. Moreover, several subcultures have arisen -- of people who were born deaf, or achondroplastic or intersexual -- who do not want to be regarded as handicapped and do not want to be "repaired."
At the same time, surgeons say that their techniques are better than ever, and that they can effectively correct many physical defects early enough that children will grow up never knowing they were outliers to begin with. And many doctors argue that the benefits of fitting in, while easy to pooh-pooh as adults, are hard to overstate for children and teen-agers.
In addition, the number of children born with obvious disabilities is declining as the resolution of prenatal ultrasound and other fetal diagnostic procedures improves, allowing parents to abort abnormal fetuses. "What we're seeing now with conjoined twins is a lot of termination of these pregnancies," said Dr. James A. O'Neill Jr., surgeon in chief at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville.
In sum, the dominant culture appears to be moving in two contradictory directions: more accommodating of disabilities in adults, but less tolerant of imperfections in children. "I'm concerned that as more abnormal children are prevented through abortion and testing, we'll be less tolerant of abnormality," said Dr. Alan R. Fleischman, a bioethicist and senior vice president of the New York Academy of Medicine in Manhattan. "We'll blame families if they knew there would be an abnormal child but chose not to abort."
 
The Mystique
From Roman God To Barnum Freaks
Nobody knows what causes conjoining, but most experts assume it arises when a fertilized egg begins to split in two, as happens with identical twins, but then fails to complete the fission. The conjoining can occur at many points of the body, and result in a variety of configurations, from a major sharing of brain, heart, liver or intestines, as well as external limbs, to the development of two nearly complete individuals connected only by a minor bridge of flesh on the torso. For unknown reasons, about three-quarters of conjoined twins are female. All but 25 percent of conjoined twins are either stillborn or die soon after birth.
Those who survive have always been objects of fascination. Mythical creatures like the two-faced god Janus and the Centaurs are thought to have been inspired by conjoined twins. The most renowned of all conjoined twins were Chang and Eng Bunker, Chinese brothers who were born in Siam in the early 19th century and thus were called Siamese twins by P. T. Barnum, who was their manager for a time.
Attached by a round band of flesh extending from breastbone to navel, the Bunkers profited handsomely by exhibiting themselves to the public, and were able to become gentlemen farmers and slave owners in North Carolina. They married two daughters of a clergyman, set up two separate households, and between them fathered 22 children.
A musical now on Broadway called "Side Show" celebrates the lives of another famous set of conjoined twins, Daisy and Violet Hilton, who appeared in the classic 1932 movie "Freaks" and later ended up working in a supermarket.
What people find difficult to imagine about conjoined twins is how they negotiate such ordinary needs of the body as sex and excretion, and how they can stand doing everything together. The Bunker twins managed by taking turns every three days on who was in charge. Reba Schappell capitulated to Lori for a few years while Lori attended college and then worked in a hospital. Now Lori says it is Reba's turn to dominate, and she accompanies her sister to recording sessions and performances, at which she practices a kind of Zen detachment. "I'm just there, I'm not doing anything," said Lori. "I say hi to people, but then I let Reba get down to business."
Yet the sisters also engage in a constant and perhaps largely subconscious dance of intimacy: fixing a sister's stray lock of hair, or picking a bit of lint off the other's shirt. When they move through a shopping mall they look like young girls, best friends, heads bowed together, murmuring to each other, swept up in a realm of their own.
Doctors who have performed separation surgeries say that the apparent contentment of the Schappell sisters is just as well, for in their case separation is probably impossible, and would lead to mutual death by hemorrhaging. But surgeons say that each case of conjoined twins is unique, and that in many instances separation is possible, if difficult. They insist that even risky attempts are usually worth the effort, and that the hard truth is, yes, it may be better to end up with one reasonably normal singleton than to accept conjoined twins, whose shared organs may not be up to supporting them, and whose lives will be severely restricted.
In a paper that appeared recently in Pediatric Surgery International, Dr. John Raffensperger, a retired surgeon from Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, recounted two cases of separation surgery in which the stronger of the twins was given the bulk of the shared organs, and the weaker one eventually died. The survivors, now 16 and 12, appear to be "well-adjusted," Dr. Raffensperger writes, although one "has questions about why her sister died."
Dr. John M. Templeton Jr., formerly a pediatric surgeon and now president of the John Templeton Foundation, recalled the first separation surgery he performed, in 1974, with Dr. C. Everett Koop, on 13-month-old girls from the Dominican Republic who were connected from the liver to the lower pelvis. "We thought they would have tremendous anxiety when they were no longer conjoined, so we put their two beds side by side," he said. "To be honest, they seemed almost relieved to be separated."
The girls fared well after the surgery, but two years later, one of them choked to death on a bean. Her sister grew up and in 1994 gave birth to a normal baby boy.
For parents, the desire to give their children as normal a life as possible is so profound that it can override any fears they have about the dangers of separation surgery. Michelle Roderick said that after she gave birth in May 1996 to Shawna and Janelle, attached at the abdomen, she and her husband never considered keeping the girls conjoined.
"We felt that since the chances were so good that they'd come out of it as healthy individuals, we didn't think it would be fair not to try," she said. "If they'd stayed conjoined, they wouldn't have been able to walk normally or develop normally and it would have been pretty sad."
The surgery took more than seven hours, and at one point Shawna went into cardiac arrest and almost died, Ms. Roderick said. But today, the girls run around and talk a mad streak like any other toddlers, displaying their pencil-thin scars to all who care to see them.
Dr. Dreger said she was not immutably opposed to separation surgery, nor does she romanticize the state of being conjoined. What she does question is the presumption behind the most radical surgical pyrotechnics that a life conjoined is hopeless, absurd, no life at all. She argues that decisions about who is in pain and who should be fixed -- whatever their purported abnormality -- must go beyond mechanical or economic or even philosophical considerations, to include the voices of those who know best.
"We need to have people who live with a condition be allowed to describe for themselves what it's like," she said. "Otherwise we'll assume it's a living hell, and that we're doing the right thing by eliminating them."

HEADLINE: Hollywood Bets It All On Openings;
As the Cost of Films Rises, They Have Less and Less Time to Find an Audience

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
"Titanic," "Tomorrow Never Dies," "Scream 2," "Flubber," "Amistad" or "Anastasia." If you haven't been drawn to the blockbusters released since Thanksgiving, wait a day or two. Something new will come along: "As Good as It Gets," "The Postman," "Kundun." For even as the cost of making and marketing the typical big-budget film approaches $70 million, the window of opportunity each movie has to find an audience is shrinking.
"It's as if Procter and Gamble had to launch a new toothpaste every other week," proposed Frank Rose, author of "The Agency," a history of the William Morris talent agency. 
 Many people in the business are inclined to write off this make-it-or-break-it focus on the first weekend's box office gross as a self-destructive impulse from an industry notorious for chasing the flavor-of-the-month. But a closer look suggests that method lurks beneath the seeming madness that overtakes the film industry, especially at peak moviegoing times like Thanksgiving to New Year's.
The economics of marketing now powerfully favors nationwide openings in thousands of theaters over the traditional "platforming" approach, in which a movie opens in a few cities and builds. "Distributors are effectively forced to spend everything up front," said Howard Lichtman, executive vice president for marketing for the Cineplex Odeon theater chain.
The intensity of the drive for a big opening weekend has often produced accusations that studios inflate figures. Box office figures are based on the number of theaters showing a film, which is compiled in part by the studio. Yesterday, Miramax Films, owned by the Walt Disney Company, admitted that it had inflated ticket sales for the opening weekend of "Scream 2." Miramax said the film grossed only $33 million on its opening weekend (Dec. 12-14), not the $39 million at first reported, because Miramax miscounted the theaters where it was playing.
The revenues from domestic theatrical release are a shrinking share of the total income from the typical film aimed at a mass audience. The opening has thus become the fulcrum for selling everything from videos to foreign distribution to toys and popcorn. As an indirect result, shelf life on the big screen is shrinking.
To be sure, there are no absolutes in film marketing. Many movies, in particular foreign films and independent productions with modest budgets, still open in a handful of theaters and still rely on media reviews and word-of-mouth to create an audience large enough to justify the move to the multiplexes.
By the same token, $50 million-plus productions are occasionally shown in New York or Los Angeles in time to qualify for Academy Award nominations, then open nationally months later. And "sneak previews" are still sometimes used to create a buzz weeks before the publicity avalanche. But with big-budget movies, the trend toward betting it all on the opening weekend seems inexorable.
In the early 1970's a typical movie with broad appeal might open in 300 to 400 theaters. Today the seven major studios are releasing record numbers of films, 216 in 1996 compared with 134 in 1980. Yet the 2,000- to 3,000-screen opening, in an industry with a total of 29,000 screens, has become commonplace. On Thanksgiving weekend, for example, "Flubber" opened on 2,641 screens.
Television has played a key role in the change. While distributors have used local television spots for decades to supplement print advertising, Warner Brothers pioneered the use of network television as its principal advertising medium in the early 1980's, and others soon followed.
Today prime-time shows on Wednesday and Thursday are flooded with trailers for next weekend's movies. And for good reason. Despite the high cost, one studio executive said, national television delivers frequent moviegoers at the lowest price per person.
By the same token, it is widely accepted that an advertising blitz is more cost-effective than the same number of spots spread over a longer period. "There are too many mice running around the field where the elephants are dancing," concluded Peter Graves, president for marketing at Polygram Films.
 
Theater Profits Come From Popcorn
 While dependence on television drives the saturation opening, so too does the contemporary economics of movie exhibition. Between 1980 and 1996, the number of auditoriums increased by 69 percent while movie attendance rose just 31 percent, creating what is widely perceived as a glut in theater capacity.
It's not clear whether "glut" is the right word since, thanks to higher ticket prices, the total domestic box office gross rose 115 percent in the same period. But there's little doubt that theaters often strain to fill auditoriums at $6 to $8 a ticket and put a premium on booking first-run films studded with stars and special effects that draw audiences.
That fresh, glitzy product has become extremely expensive to generate. The average movie from the seven major studios cost $39 million to make last year, up from $9 million in 1980. And while every deal between distributors and exhibitors is negotiated, the split in box office revenues, typically 70-30 in the first few weeks of a run, heavily favors the distributors.
As a result, theaters are lucky to cover their costs on box office revenues, with the real profits coming from the young, junk-food-craving consumers at the concession stand. "They've become candy stores looking to move people in and out as fast as they can," explained Tom Sherak, vice president for marketing at 20th Century Fox.
The exhibitors' emphasis on the rapid turnover of first-run films is complemented by changes in the market for the Hollywood product. Two decades ago most of the revenue from most movies came from the domestic theatrical release. Since then theatrical revenues from Europe, Latin America and Asia have become increasingly important, often exceeding the domestic box office. Foreign revenues from "Men in Black," the film that outstripped the competition last summer, for example, are approaching $300 million.
 
VCR and Cable Make a Vast Market
 By the same token, the value of ancillary rights has exploded. The number of households with VCR's has grown from 1.8 million in 1980 to 78 million today, creating a market for 641 million recorded videocassettes in 1996. Pay-cable channels consume vast numbers of movies, and with 55 million subscribers, they have plenty of cash to bid up the value of the rights. Pay-per-view movies on television is a rapidly growing area, with an estimated 28 million households paying $603 million in 1997 for them.
As a result, says Marvin Antonowsky, the former head of marketing for Universal Pictures, the domestic theatrical release "has become part of the broader marketing campaign" to maximize the value of a film.
And much of the benefit to this broader campaign apparently comes from the validating effect of a smash opening weekend. "The media report box office scores like a horse race," said Mr. Lichtman at Cineplex Odeon. "If you're in first place, it's the stamp of approval" that pays dividends long after the movie leaves the theaters.
Each escalation in the competition for the hearts and wallets of consumers of filmed entertainment generates concern that specialized tastes will be given short shrift in the rush to satisfy the mass audience. But while the emphasis on producing blockbusters with a short theatrical life has created what Charles Cicchetti of Civic Economics, consulting group in Los Angeles, calls "a bimodal distribution of expensive and inexpensive films with few in the middle," it is hard to identify an audience that isn't being served as well as it was in the past.
"Movies no longer age like good champagne," agrees Mr. Antonowsky, but there are compensating virtues to freshness.

With more movies being produced since the early 80's and revenues relatively flat, there is a bigger premium than ever on being No. 1 on the first weekend. Figures are adjusted for inflation, in 1997 dollars. More movies are being released . . . and there are more screens to show them on. Movies cost more to make . . . and to promote . . . but box office revenues have been flat.

HEADLINE: Design Houses Lament Asia's Faltering Economies

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The visual rhetoric of fashion has always had a tenuous relationship with its actual business plan.
A few of those house-defining gowns depicted so lavishly in magazine advertisements do sell, but most fashion profits are raked in at the perfume and accessories counter. And while there certainly are affluent American customers for designer goods, roughly half the world's full-priced luxury purchases are made by Asians, either in their own countries or while traveling. 
 And so, many fashion companies have pegged their growth in recent years to the Pacific, mostly through the sales of handbags, perfumes and other goodies that fit in the overhead compartment of an airplane.
But this business reality is being severely tested these days as Asia suffers an economic upheaval that has severely injured the luxury retail business in Hong Kong, Korea and other nations and has caused many luxury-goods companies to rein in their growth plans, at least for now.
"The wealthy Asian consumer just went over the cliff and will probably stay quite depressed over 1998," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the investment bank in New York. "Most of these high-end retailers that had been counting on Asian yuppies for their growth over the next 10 years are stuck with American yuppies for now."
Economic weaknesses throughout Asia have caused currencies and stock prices to plunge: Hong Kong, the hot spot of luxury goods sales, has taken a beating since October, and the Japanese economy has been in a protracted slump, with recent bank failures underscoring the seriousness.
At the same time, the currencies of a number of Southeast Asian countries -- spots that fashion has eyed for years -- have also weakened sharply during the last several months. And in South Korea, where the International Monetary Fund was recently forced to come up with a $57 billion financial-disaster bailout, there has also been a popular backlash against foreign luxury goods. If that mood continues, there could be long-term trouble ahead.
All these problems have meant one simple thing: There are far fewer people willing or able to shell out for leather handbags and spike-heeled shoes these days, let alone for the matched designer outfits the Asian customer favors.
Luxury sales in Tokyo have remained mostly steady, but foreign travel is down for the Japanese. And people are no longer flocking in such huge numbers to Hong Kong, where two-thirds of the economy has traditionally been based on consumer spending. Sales in luxury stores throughout the rest of Asia have ranged from spotty to downright miserable over the last few months, and the carnage is visible.
Shares of Gucci tumbled 18 percent this fall, and though they have recovered somewhat (they closed yesterday at $39.875 on the New York Stock Exchange), they are nowhere near their high of $73 last June. The picture is similar for LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton, the largest luxury products company in the world, as it is for Dickson Concepts, a luxury goods producer and retailer based in Hong Kong: both have been hammered on their home stock exchanges since October.
It gets worse. Joyce Boutiques Holdings, which operates high-fashion stores in Hong Kong, said it lost $27.9 million Hong Kong (about $3.6 million United States) for the half year that ended Sept. 30. Business partners in Taiwan are taking longer to pay the French shoemaker Robert Clergerie; Calvin Klein has put its Korean and Hong Kong expansion plans on hold, and Donna Karan International is eager to sell its Japanese affiliate, company executives say.
In a poignant example of how the growth equation has shifted, DFS Group, the duty-free-store empire that has been on the leading edge of Asian expansion, is now angling to buy Barneys New York for a little American sales pop. And luxury goods merchants everywhere are now pinning hopes on Europe, until now regarded as anemic.
"In Europe, there are still a lot of markets for us," said Ippolito Etro, the chief financial officer at the Italian fashion house Etro. "And I see a lot of companies pushing toward the States, the only market which is still big and where you can still increase."
Asia accounted for 38 percent of the Italian company's growth last year: for 1997, it will be just 31 percent. The Asian economic crisis, "has kind of stopped our growth there," Mr. Etro said.
Domenico De Sole, chief executive of Gucci, said that all luxury companies have to focus on other markets in the short term. "It is pretty clear people have to change the focus of their business and gain strength in United States and Europe," said Mr. De Sole, whose company makes 10 percent of its sales in Asia and another large chunk in Hawaii, a prime tourist destination. "Balance is very important."
The Asian shopper is not only in the majority in stores from Milan to New York to Hong Kong, but also more geared to buying entire outfits than, say, her American counterpart, who might pair a Prada skirt with a Hanes T-shirt. So losing an Asian shopper is more serious.
"What is striking when you see consumers in Asia is their whole head-to-toe concept," said Faye Landes, a retail analyst at Smith Barney in New York. "They take a different view of the product, which is that they want it all. Showing that you made it is such an important concept to Asians, and luxury has meshed really well with that."
For a large publicly traded company like Gucci, the storm may be weathered by trying to focus on sales in other regions. But small companies with huge Asian exposure may find themselves in a typhoon.
Consider a company like Anna Sui, where at least 40 percent of the business comes from Asian clients, executives say.
The company has recently established a partnership with the Isetan Company of Japan to license and distribute its goods exclusively in Japan and some other Asian countries; it also has a relationship with Joyce in Hong Kong. "Over the last year, the plan we developed was to take a strong but measured approach to Asia," said Rod Kosann, the company's president. "From 1997 to 1998 we are looking for our business to grow 20 percent there. We look at what is going on and are concerned about it, but we think it is going to be a great market."
Indeed, more than a dozen fashion executives interviewed last week -- at companies ranging from Anna Sui to Bulgari -- said that they were cheery about Asia in the long term, or they bragged that their exposure was really quite limited after all. Others seemed to feel that the problems are those of their licensed partners.
But these arguments have flaws. "Only" 10 percent of Polo/Ralph Lauren's business is done in Asia, a spokesman said, but a big portion of its 10.2 percent growth in licensing revenue was made there in 1996, according to financial documents filed when the company went public. Conversely, many companies have saturated the American and European marketplace.
And even if licensees or retail partners are the ones that have to take the initial hit, those partners will be buying less merchandise or forcing vendors to mark it down.
"If Asia is big in their portfolio, their future is very difficult to assess," said Joyce Boutiques' president, Roberto Dominici, referring to fashion companies. He added that on the retail end, inventory budgets will fall.
For a tiny vendor that has depended heavily on Asian growth, the crisis could be a serious threat. But for companies with a cash cushion to carry them through or with strong sales elsewhere in the world, it makes no sense at all to leave Asia now.
"Producers have a longer time horizon when they think about production and market share," said Steve Radelet, an economist at the Institute for International Development at Harvard University. "And for people interested in the long term, Asia is where the action is. With 60 percent of world's population growing at 7 percent a year, you have to be there."
In the meantime, several fashion companies have made some moves to lessen the pain. Marc Jacobs, for example, is offering a few lower-priced products to Asian licensees. "I'll work with them," said Robert Duffy, Mr. Jacobs's business partner. He might make items that are "not as labor intensive or heavy," he said.
And for rich fashion vendors, there is even a silver lining. As prices fall in Hong Kong and elsewhere, some companies will be able to snatch up Asian real estate.
"The good news is that high-end vendors have the opportunities to buy stores very cheaply now if they have a long-term view," said Mr. Yardeni of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. "But they also have to recognize they have to have stamina."

Tent Economics
Now that Seventh on Sixth is moving back to Bryant Park, the question is how the shows found themselves with a view of New Jersey to begin with. The answer may lie in the sweet deal the group got from Chelsea Piers. Seventh on Sixth was looking at a bill significantly lower than that incurred in Bryant Park. 
 Renting the piers space cost $150,000 to $200,000 a season, said Fern Mallis, executive director of Seventh on Sixth.
The tents -- with lighting, sound, seating and other accouterments -- are likely to ring up a bill closer to $2 million. That's about $500,000 more than it cost in the past. The extra cost, though not final, is a result of added tents.
"It costs significantly more to put up a tent than to move into an existing building," Ms. Mallis said.
Being in the tents will make the shows substantially more attractive to sponsors, some of whom had threatened to pull out of the unified shows at the piers.
Plans for the return of Seventh on Sixth are on the drawing board but there will no longer be a Gertrude tent, which seated close to 1,000, nor a Josephine Pavilion. Instead, three tent show spaces will be erected.
The largest will seat about 780, with a capacity of 1,030. A second multipurpose tent will accommodate between 550 and 700 guests, and the smallest tent, 150 guests. "Nobody wants those huge tents anymore," Ms. Mallis said. "In mid-January we'll present these plans to designers and get feedback."
The accessories exhibition, which had been housed in buildings near the park, will be in a fourth tent.
Additional space may be provided by TrizecHahn Office Properties, a real estate company that owns 1411 Broadway and 1114 Avenue of the Americas.
"We have a great investment in the the health of the apparel center in New York," said Doug Winshall, general manager of the New York region for TrizecHahn. "We're committed to helping Seventh on Sixth putting on the shows."
 
Samples, but Much More
The fashion industry may as well christen December sample sale season, with the plethora of fliers being handed out in midtown.
Both the known and the unknown -- those whose only claim to fame is often "get it below wholesale" -- have been staging sales aimed at capturing the Christmas shopper and clearing out industry goods.
Donna Karan, Rebecca Moses, Escada, Louis Feraud, Phat Farm, John Bartlett, Genny, Katayone Adeli, Fila, Showroom Seven and Onward Kashiyama, which represents ICB and Helmut Lang, have been sold directly by the manufacturer to the public in recent weeks.
What is mostly at work here is the large scale on which business is being done these days and the difficulty of selling clothes at retail prices. With more stores forcing designers to take back unsold goods, selling directly to the public even at below wholesale prices generates important cash flow for companies.
With outlet stores one of the fastest-growing retail segments, sample sales -- a misnomer, since so much more than samples is sold -- are but an extension of fashion companies handling their own markdowns.
For bargain seekers -- and who isn't? -- December sample sales are a way to say, "Happy holidays."
Saks Wed to Avant-Garde
Rosemarie Bravo is gone from Saks Fifth Avenue, but the strategy she initiated, turning the store into a destination for shoppers seeking avant-garde fashion, is in full swing.
For spring, Saks -- whose advertising leans toward Vogue and Architectural Digest -- will run an eight-page insert in Wallpaper and Interview magazines featuring designs by John Bartlett, Alberta Ferretti for Philosophi, Susan Lazar, Marc Eisen and Gianfranco Ferre for Gieffeffe.
"We're continuing to build that market segment," said Sheri Wilson-Gray, Saks's executive vice president for marketing. "A really serious fashion customer probably looks at a lot of different publications. For those who are narrow fashion customers, they really want to be into what other people are not doing."
The focus on what Saks calls advanced collections has yet to affect its bottom line, but the store believes it can lure this customer with the right emphasis. "We like 'advanced' better than 'young,' " Ms. Wilson said. "To be hip in your attitude or forward in your design attitude isn't necessarily about your age."

HEADLINE: Dangerous Inertia in Japan

 BODY:
Whether the financial turmoil in East Asia remains a regional problem or spreads across the world depends in no small measure on Japan. So far, Japan has barely been able to maintain its own balance. Instead of bold steps to deregulate financial institutions and disclose the extent of Japanese problems, Tokyo's bureaucrats have employed half-measures. Japan must set an example of reform, otherwise the rot in financial institutions throughout the area is not likely to be excised.
Japan, with the world's second-largest economy, dwarfs other Asian nations. Its problems -- failing banks, opaque bookkeeping and corrupt interlocking corporate relationships -- are equally great. Last week plunging Japanese stock prices and declines in the value of the yen forced Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to stimulate the economy. Though opposed by the Finance Ministry, it was a welcome but inadequate step. 
 Japan has been hit before by economic blows, most notably the energy crises of the 1970's. But what worked in the past, including heavy government involvement in propping up businesses and banks, will not work now. This is no time for the Finance Ministry to adhere to its tradition of keeping the economy closed to outside scrutiny, or preventing bankruptcies of weakened corporations or banks by arranging for friendly partners to rescue institutions that should be allowed to fail. Recently the Ministry has allowed some businesses to go under, and Mr. Hashimoto has proposed a $70 billion plan to bail out depositors, but more aggressive steps are needed.
Japan has repeatedly rebuffed American suggestions for government action to spur domestic economic growth. The Finance Ministry's actions have raised fears that Japan will try to grow out of its downturn by expanding exports, aggravating trade deficits at a time when Americans are already suspicious of the dangers of increased trade. The package announced by Mr. Hashimoto last week consisted of about $45 billion in tax cuts and spending increases. Economists say it will not increase growth by much more than half a percentage point. Part of the problem is that the Hashimoto package was barely enough to offset the budget cuts and tax hikes that the Finance Ministry foolishly rammed through Parliament earlier this year.
Prime Minister Hashimoto needs to follow up his initial steps with other economic reforms. Previous actions to deregulate the telecommunications industry, for example, have brought an infusion of investment and expansion. The same can happen in transportation, construction, distribution and real estate. As for the weak Japanese banks, they could face more blows at the end of March, when tough new standards on capital requirements and disclosure go into effect. Rather than shrink from the prospect, Mr. Hashimoto should demand that Japan acknowledge and address its problems. Doing so would speed Japan's own recovery and set the right example for Asia.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises on New Evidence Of Weakness in Asia Markets

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the yen yesterday as Japanese stocks fell to their lowest level in more than two years amid fear of more corporate failures and continuing economic sluggishness in much of Asia.
The Nikkei index of 225 leading stocks dropped 3.37 percent, to 14,799.40, the first time the index had closed under the psychologically important 15,000 level since July 1995. 
 Currency traders seemed less than impressed by comments from an unidentified Japanese Finance Ministry official, who ruled out more near-term bank failures, insisting that Japanese banks were solvent.
The yen was also dragged lower by signs of fresh economic woes elsewhere in Asia as the International Monetary Fund reduced its combined growth forecast for Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines by 3.7 percentage points, to 1.7 percent, and predicted that Japan would grow 1.1 percent in 1998.
News that Moody's Investors Service had downgraded Government debt ratings for South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand also weighed on the yen. But traders stopped short of taking the dollar significantly higher in thin, holiday-season trading, concerned that the Bank of Japan might be ready to resume large-scale purchases of yen in an effort to prop up the currency's value.
"There is still a fear of central bank intervention even though the dollar remains bid," said Ralph Del Zenero, vice president for foreign exchange at the First Chicago Bank.
The Japanese central bank is believed to have spent around $10 billion last week to buy yen, and traders said it might be waiting for another opportunity to surprise the markets. The exchanges will be closed in Japan today, and trading is expected to wind down in Europe and the United States.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar settled at 130.13 yen, up from 128.93 yen on Friday. It was quoted at 1.7810 German marks, up from 1.7753 marks. The British pound fell to $1.6633 from $1.6681.
In other trading, the dollar was up against the Canadian dollar, shrugging off a new attempt by the Bank of Canada to shore up its currency. The Canadian dollar eased to 69.81 United States cents, from 69.86 cents on Friday.

HEADLINE: Stocks Regain Ground, With Dow Up 63.02

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stock prices rose yesterday for the first time in four days, led by Intel and other computing shares that had recently lagged behind the market.
"Investors are moving into beaten-up stocks, particularly technology companies," said Tony Hitschler, president of Brandywine Asset Management, which oversees $7 billion. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 63.02, or 0.8 percent, to 7,819.31, led by Merck & Company. Merck rose 3 5/16to 105 15/16 , after receiving Government clearance to sell the first pill to treat baldness. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 6.92, or 0.7 percent, to 953.70.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 7.32, or 0.5 percent, to 1,532.06. Intel, the most active stock in United States trading, rose 1 7/16 , to 71 7/16 . Intel, however, is still off 29 percent from its Aug. 20 high.
Other computing stocks gained. Dell Computer gained 3 5/16 , to 81 5/8, Compaq rose 1 1/8, to 54 5/8, and Hewlett-Packard advanced 2, to 63 1/8,
The gains came after Asian markets declined. Moody's Investors Service Inc. cut its investment ratings on South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand to junk, intensifying concern that a regional cash squeeze will drive companies into default.
Technology analysts at Goldman, Sachs & Company said in a report that while the economies of the United States and Europe remain healthy, "the current strength of the U.S. dollar and Asian situation will likely alter trading patterns over the near term, tempering U.S. exports."
Stocks were helped by acquisition announcements. Lukens Inc. jumped 4 1/2, to 28 1/2, after Allegheny Teledyne Inc. offered to acquire the steelmaker for $715 million in cash and assumed debt, topping the Bethlehem Steel Corporation's bid. Allegheny Teledyne rose 1 3/8, to 25 5/16 , and Bethlehem Steel gained 5/8, to 8 7/16 .
American International Group Inc. said it would pay $2.2 billion in stock and cash for American Bankers Insurance Group. American Bankers rose 1 7/16 , to 45 11/16 , and AIG rose 1 1/2, to 106 3/8.
The American Home Products Corporation rose 3/4, to 74 7/8, after Tyco International Ltd. said it would buy its Sherwood-Davis & Geck unit for about $1.8 billion, expanding Tyco's medical-products line. Tyco rose 1 15/16 , to 42 7/8.
The Central and South West Corporation gained 1 1/8, to 27 1/8 after the American Electric Power Company said it would buy the company for $12.2 billion in stock and assumed debt, in the biggest-ever acquisition of an electric utility. The combined company will serve more than 4.6 million customers in 11 states and 4 million customers outside the United States. American Electric fell 1 1/4, to 50 3/4.
The Baltimore Gas and Electric Company and the Potomac Electric Company canceled their $3.8 billion purchase agreement because regulators asked for too much in rate cuts from them. Baltimore Gas rose 11/16 , to 32 15/16 , and Potomac Electric fell 5/16 , to 23 1/8.
Xionics Document Technologies Inc. was the biggest decliner in United States markets, tumbling 6 9/32 , to 31 9/32 . The developer of software for office equipment said it expects net income for the fiscal second quarter of 2 cents a share, 8 cents below analyst forecasts. The company in part blamed "increasing uncertainty in the Asian market." The Capital One Financial Corporation rose 1 13/16 , to 50 1/4, after it said it expects its 1997 earnings to exceed analysts' expectations on marketing initiatives and improving credit outlook.

HEADLINE: 2 Ex-Dictators Leave Korea Jails, Pardoned After 2 Years

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 22

 BODY:
 The former military dictators Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo walked out of prison today and returned home to warm welcomes with some brief but kind words for their former enemy, President-elect Kim Dae Jung.
The two former Presidents, wearing suits and overcoats, emerged from separate prisons and were taken by limousines to their homes in Seoul, where their families and hundreds of well-wishers waited with flowers and "welcome home" signs. 
 Mr. Chun had been sentenced to life in prison and Mr. Roh to 17 years for their roles in the 1979 military coup that brought Mr. Chun to power, for the violent suppression of a pro-democracy uprising in Kwangju in 1980 and for the collection of millions of dollars in bribes from businessmen.
But after spending only about two years behind bars, the two former generals were pardoned on Saturday after a decision by President-elect Kim, a former dissident whom they had once sentenced to death on false charges in 1980, and by President Kim Young Sam, another former opposition leader whom they had placed under house arrest.
As he left Anyang Prison south of Seoul, Mr. Chun told reporters that it was "fortunate" that such a "reliable" President had been elected. But he seemed less favorably inclined to the incumbent President, who had prosecuted him, saying he was surprised by the nation's economic crisis.
"I apologize for causing the Korean public anxiety," Mr. Chun said, adding in reference to the economy, "I believe that we can overcome the crisis because of the inherent strength of the Korean people."
Mr. Roh congratulated Mr. Kim on his election and said: "I expect that President-elect Kim Dae Jung will give all he has to save the economy, which has neared collapse. I also believe he will overcome all conflict, including regional tensions, to create unity."
The two former Presidents looked healthy, if somewhat thinner and grayer than when they entered prison.
When he arrived at his home in Seoul, Mr. Chun waved to the crowd and lifted one of his small grandsons into his arms. Mr. Roh stood outside his home with his wife, holding hands, and walked through the crowd shaking hands and apologizing for his actions. His eldest son, Roh Jae Hun, returned from the United States for the occasion.
Dozens of riot policemen were on hand, but there were no disturbances. At Mr. Chun's prison, however, a small group of people protested his release and were restrained by the police.
Kim Dae Jung agreed to the pardon to unify the country and allow it to concentrate on solving the economic crisis, which has led to the $57 billion-plus rescue by the International Monetary Fund.
Mr. Kim was elected with barely over 40 percent of the vote in a three-way race and has little support from the southeast part of the country, the home base of Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh.
Human rights groups protested the pardons, saying it was unfair to free the two former dictators while not doing the same for people who are still in prison under the strict national security law for having championed democracy or for sympathizing with North Korea.
Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh were restored to full rights as citizens, meaning they can re-enter politics if they choose. But their fines for bribery, which could amount to more than $100 million each, are still supposed to be paid.
Also freed today were 23 other men, most of whom were aides to Mr. Chun, who was President until 1988, or Mr. Roh, his handpicked successor, who served until early 1993.

HEADLINE: Racial Edge Sharpens Debate On South Africa's Gun Laws

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: LENASIA TOWNSHIP, South Africa, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The eyes of Frederick Mosila, a taxi fleet owner, were stiff and unblinking behind his dark glasses as he leaned on the counter of Lenasia Arms & Ammunition. He buried his wife this weekend. "She was in the hospital three weeks," he said. "She was joking and laughing, but she said her legs were paining her. I came back the next day -- and they said she had died at 7."
She had been shot in the back, he said, quietly miming how the bullet passed through her body as she opened their garden gate in Soweto. The killer ran away in the dark. Mr. Mosila assumes it was someone from a rival taxi company. 
 He was buying ammunition for his licensed 9-millimeter pistol, he said, to defend himself and his children. Someone shot at him several weeks before his wife was killed.
He had applied for gun licenses five times, he said, both under apartheid and under the new government. He was rejected the first four times.
South Africa, a country rife with crime, is in the midst of a fierce debate over gun laws. On paper, they are very strict, but enforcement is haphazard. There is a strong gun culture, but only in some segments of the fractionated population. Afrikaners, the white descendants of Dutch and French Huguenot settlers who fought their way up the continent in the 1800's, have a frontier gun-owning tradition. Blacks were long forbidden to own guns. There was illegal trafficking in guns, but those weapons mostly circulated among criminals. Then in the mid-1980's, the Soviet bloc issued thousands of AK-47's and pistols to anti-apartheid guerrillas and the police handed guns to opponents of the African National Congress. That infusion of weapons fostered political killings and the crime wave plaguing black townships that has given South Africa a murder rate estimated to be five times that of the United States.
Crime has created a desire among many blacks -- like those visiting Lenasia Arms, the closest gun shop to southern Soweto -- to own guns.
A gun-control movement was founded in 1994, about the same time the authorities began granting requests by blacks to own guns. The movement is growing, but it suffers a crucial weakness: Since its founders are white, it is sometimes portrayed as racist, an idea encouraged by the gun shop owners' lobby.
The founders of Gun-Free South Africa, the most prominent group, vehemently deny that, pointing out that they are veterans of the anti-apartheid movement and are supported by black church leaders and police officers. But there are those who say non-whites commit most of the country's crime and whites wanting guns already have them, so guns should now be tightly controlled to keep them out of non-white hands.
The new Constitution guarantees the right to life and "freedom and security of the person." It does not mention a right to bear arms. Existing laws, written under apartheid, differ sharply from American ones.
Here, it is easier to get a license for a pistol than for a shotgun, a weapon that can be bought over the counter in many American states. The hardest kind of license to get is for a .22-caliber rifle because the assumption here is that a pistol is for self-defense, but quiet small-caliber rifles are the tools of assassins and poachers. Farmers, a powerful lobby in the past, hate poachers.
While concealed weapons imply criminal intent in much of the United States, here guns must be hidden. The assumption is that a gun displayed is an attempt to intimidate.
To buy a gun, an applicant must fill out a four-page police form. Applicants generally must have a job, references and a clean criminal record. The applicant must also pass a gun safety course and a have a steel gun safe bolted to brick or cement at home. The process takes from one to three months.
"You make such a fuss in America about a five-day waiting period," said Adelle Kirsten, national coordinator of Gun-Free South Africa. "To us, that's crazy."
The process is often slipshod, she said. Few references are checked, false identity numbers are submitted, data bases of stolen weapons and criminal records are weak.
Ms. Kirsten said Gun-Free South Africa wants to tighten the laws, and get more money for the police to do better background checks.
"We have to get rid of the myth that guns make you safer," she said.
About 10,500 South Africans were killed with guns last year. Ms. Kirsten's group estimates that there are 7 million guns in the country. About 80,000 a year are stolen from private owners.
Although blacks were legally allowed to apply for licenses in 1983, almost none of their applications were accepted, gun shop owners say, until 1994, when Nelson Mandela led the African National Congress to victory in South Africa's first national elections open to all races.
Immediately, a large new market was created. In the 1980's, said Rajen Dukken, who is of Indian ancestry, some white gun shop owners wouldn't let him touch their wares even though he was in a shooting club. Now he is manager of Lenasia Arms.
"After 1994, many re-tuned themselves for the black trade," he said. "Now you feel like a real customer, because of the color of your money."
In the last year, gun shop owners said, police refusals of applications have increased.
Because of the "taxi wars," -- battles between taxi fleets over routes that have led to violence -- people who work in that business, like Mr. Mosila, are routinely turned down. So are the unemployed, for fear they will rob people, and squatter camp residents, because a safe can't be attached to a tin wall.
Illegal guns and poor police protection are most prevalent in the neighborhoods where law-abiding black citizens live. "They come right into your house and help themselves to your daughters," said Boy Mahlaba, a middle-aged Soweto resident.
The Government finds the issue just as difficult. Ms. Kirsten says she has had some lobbying success, but most of her support comes from women in Parliament and from law-enforcement officials upset at the high rate of killings of policemen.
But in the rank-and-file of the African National Congress, support is shaky. "We're not naive enough to think that the reason the majority of black people don't have guns is because they believe as we do," she said. "It's because they can't afford them."

Outlook for Profits: Asia Is Clouding the Picture

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Every earnings season can hold nasty surprises for investors. But with the stock market swooning lately over reports of financial turmoil in Asia and every lowering of profit expectations by a major American corporation, some analysts are worrying that the shocks in early 1998 will be particularly unpleasant.
But, as they scour Asia for signs of where its economies -- and orders for American goods and services -- are going, analysts and corporate executives are warning of the difficulty of predicting the fallout from the spreading crisis there. "It's a very complicated issue," said Thomas Doerflinger, an investment strategist at Paine Webber. "Costs are being changed by shifts in currencies and demand flows in each country. It's tricky." 
 And many strategists are cautioning that the bad news from Asia will show up more sharply in the reports for the first quarter, which do not come out until spring, than in those that will be issued in January and February.
"What is coming up will give us some clues but not the final story," said Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in San Francisco. The shutting of factories, the impact of tighter credit and the mass layoffs will not be fully reflected in the fourth quarter, he said, adding, "The real pain is still ahead."
With American high-technology stocks showing greater volatility lately than those in many other industries, the efforts of two closely watched companies to assess the impact of Asia's economic woes on their earnings prospects show the uncertainty that investors face.
The Intel Corporation, the world's top maker of integrated circuits, says the impact has been negligible -- so far, that is, and as best as it can make out. Some of the worst-hit countries, like Indonesia, are not major markets for its products, the company says. And Japan, which has been limping along economically for years, had not been expected to generate significant new orders anyway.
As a result, said a spokesman, Howard High, Intel is keeping a close eye on China and India, trying to gauge whether their economies -- and their demand for Intel's chips -- will slow because of the fallout from the rest of Asia next year.
But, he said, it it is too early to tell if there has been any significant change in the company's prospects in those two countries. This means that Intel's fourth-quarter earnings report, due out in the second week of January, may not tell the full story.
The same uncertainty applies for investors in Applied Materials, the world's largest manufacturer of computer-chip-making equipment. Although the company surprised Wall Street with better earnings than analysts expected for its fiscal fourth quarter that ended in October, investors have since then pushed the company's stock price down 42 percent because the company does more than half its sales in Asia.
"The bottom line is that we don't know yet," said Jeff Lettes, a company spokesman. "Right now with what is going on in South Korea, our customers are trying to figure out in which direction they want to move. And we have to wait until those decisions are made."
For example, Korean chip makers may find it difficult to buy the next generation of chip-making machinery right now. But on the other hand, many analysts believe they will have to do so, whatever the cost, to stay competitive.
The turmoil in Asia, combined with signs that the American economy may be peaking after years of strong growth, has divided analysts on the earnings prospects for American industry as a whole.
Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company, remains upbeat. Ms. Cohen said that the fourth quarter "is the most difficult to parse for analysts" because the write-offs companies take at the end of the year are usually much larger than in any other quarter.
But, she said, "I think the whole quarter is going to be pretty good," adding that signs from some of the banks and financial companies that will lead off the reporting season are positive. Companies are saying that the Asia factor "will not be a big deal," she said.
Mr. Doerflinger of Paine Webber, by contrast, believes that current consensus earnings estimates in the low double digits for American industry in 1998 are too high.
No matter how the final earnings reports come out, the worry about Asia and the expectation of slower growth in the United States next year have led analysts to scale back their earnings projections for the last three months of this year. According to First Call, a Boston-based firm that tracks earnings estimates by analysts around the country, the forecast for the 500 companies in the Standard & Poor's index has been revised downward over the last five weeks, to an increase of 8.3 percent from a year earlier, compared with an earlier prediction of an 11.2 percent gain.
Chuck Hill, the director of research at First Call, said the downward adjustment was much sharper than usual and raised questions about the earnings outlook for the first quarter of next year and for all of 1998. Currently, analysts expect first-quarter earnings to rise by 17 percent from the first quarter of 1997; their projection for 1998 as a whole, however, has slipped in just the last week to a 14 percent increase over 1997 from an earlier guess of 14.4 percent.
In recent quarters, actual earnings have ended up matching analysts' original projections, and surpassing their more pessimistic subsequent revisions, because positive developments have offset any bad news that had dribbled out earlier. But Mr. Hill said that there was "no way" that would happen this time around.

HEADLINE: In Clinton's Words: Fight Hard for Peace

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech by President Clinton yesterday to residents of Sarajevo, Bosnia, as transribed by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company.
I come before you with a message for those in whose hands the future of Bosnia lies -- its leaders and its people. For in the end the future is up to you -- not to the Americans, not to the Europeans, not to anyone else.
Two years ago in Dayton, Ohio, the leaders of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia made a fateful choice for peace. But their responsibility and yours did not end there on that day. In fact, it only began. 
 Your responsibility is to turn the documents signed in Dayton into a living reality; to make good on the pledge to bring Bosnia together as one country, with two multi-ethnic parts, sharing a common destiny. Those who rise to that responsibility will have the full support of the United States and the international community. Those who shirk it will isolate themselves.
The world, which continues to invest in your peace, rightfully expects that you will do your part. More important, the people of this country expect results and they deserve them.
You have accomplished much, but there is much more to do. You have established the joint institutions of democracy. Now you must work within them, sharing power as you share responsibility. You have vowed to welcome back those displaced from their homes by war. Now you must vote for the return program so that they actually can come back with stronger protections for minorities and more job creation. You are working to restore Bosnia's economy. Now you must build up the laws to attract assistance and investment, and root out the corruption that undermines confidence in economies.
You have begun to turn the media from an instrument of hate into a force of tolerance and understanding. Now you must raise it to international standards of objectivity and access, and allow an independent press the freedom to thrive. You are taking the police out of the hands of warlords. Now you must help to reform, retrain and re-equip a democratic force that fosters security, not fear. You have pledged to isolate and arrest indicted war criminals. Now you must follow through on that commitment, both for the sake of justice and in the serving of lasting peace.
Most of all, the leaders here, you owe it to your country to bring out the best in people, acting in concert, not conflict; overcoming obstacles, not creating them; rising above petty disputes, not fueling them. In the end, leaders in a democracy must bring out the best in people. But in the end, they serve the people who send them to their positions.
And so to the people of Bosnia, I say today, you must make your desire for peace and a common future clear to the leaders of each group. And you must then give leaders the absolute support they need to make the hard decisions for a common future.
The people of Bosnia can make it happen. The example that ordinary citizens set among your neighbors, the standards that you demand from your leaders, will determine this nation's fate.
After such a hard war, fighting aggressively for peace is difficult. So many have lost mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters. So many wounds are deep and scars still fresh. Energy may be short at a time when an extraordinary effort of will is required to wrench yourself from the past and to begin to build a future together. . . .
I thank all of those who are making organized efforts to build a common future, especially those who are mobilizing women, because they know so painfully how important reconciliation and reconstruction are to your families and your children's future.
What I want all of you to believe today is that you can do it. In our time, from Guatemala to South Africa, from El Salvador to Northern Ireland, people are turning from conflict to conciliation. Still, the impulse to divide, if not to actually fight and kill over ethnic or religious or racial differences, runs deep in human nature across the globe. It seems to be rooted in a fear of those who are different from ourselves . . .
I think it is important that all of you remember and teach that the war did violence not only to Bosnia's people, but also to its history, its own tradition of tolerance. Just minutes from here, standing within yards from one another are a mosque, an Orthodox church, a Catholic church and a synagogue, reminding us that generations of Muslims, Orthodox Christians, Catholics and Jews live side by side and enrich the world by their example here; built schools and libraries and wondrous places of worship. Part of that population laid down their tools on Friday, part on Saturday and part on Sunday. But their lives were woven together by marriage and culture, by work and common language and a shared pride in a place all could call home. That past should be remembered. And you should do everything in your power to make it a prologue. History can be your ally, not your enemy.
I am persuaded, having served in this office for five years, that the real differences around the world today are not between Jews and Arabs; Protestants and Catholics; Muslims, Croats and Serbs. The real differences are between those who embrace peace and those who would destroy it; between those who look to the future and those who cling to the past; between those who open their arms and those who are determined to clench their fists; between those who believe that God made all of us equal and those foolish enough to believe they are superior to others just because of the color of their skin, of the religion of their families, of their ethnic background. This is a very small nation on an increasingly small planet. None of us has the moral standing to look down on another, and we should stop it. . . .
Well, they're still here, and they're still Muslims, Croats and Serbs. And to tell you the truth, I know the tuba players from the violinists, but I can't tell the Muslims from the Croats from the Serbs. The harmony of their disparate voices -- the harmony of their disparate voices -- is what I hear. It reminds me of Bosnia's best past and it should be the clarion call to your future.
Here at the dawn of the new millennium, let us recall that the century we are leaving began with the sound of gunfire in Sarajevo. And let us vow to start the new century with the music of peace in Sarajevo.
To the people of Bosnia I say, you have seen what war has wrought; now you know what peace can bring. So seize the chance before you. You can do nothing to change the past; but if you can let it go, you can do everything to build a future. The world is watching, and the world is with you. But the choice is yours. May you make the right one.

HEADLINE: Pataki Agrees to $17 Million Deal To Protect Swath of Adirondacks

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki announced today that the state had reached a landmark agreement to buy nearly 15,000 acres of Adirondack wilderness that the Whitney family had planned to develop, while also protecting a tract twice that size for 10 years.
The $17.1 million deal opens a pristine stretch of forests, streams and lakes -- including Little Tupper Lake, regarded by naturalists as one of the region's jewels -- to the public for the first time since William C. Whitney, the industrialist, bought the land for a family retreat a century ago. 
 The acquisition will connect separate tracts of publicly owned forests in the Adirondacks, allowing canoeists and other adventurers to travel hundreds of miles without interruption. And by barring development on an additional 36,000 acres of Whitney land for the next 10 years, the state has been given time to find a way to preserve that land.
"This is a historic day for everyone who cares about the Adirondacks," the Governor said. "Through this agreement, we will preserve a uniquely valuable wilderness in the heart of the Adirondacks, insuring that future generations will be able to enjoy thousands of acres of undisturbed rivers, ponds and forests."
The Whitney family, headed by Marylou Whitney, had proposed subdividing the 14,717-acre plot and building luxury homes on it. But that plan drew bitter protests from environmentalists, who urged New York State to buy the property, which is about 35 miles southwest of Lake Placid.
Today, Mrs. Whitney, who inherited one of America's oldest fortunes from her husband, Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, spoke bluntly about how pained she was at having to give up a cherished family property for far less money than she had initially expected to get. The family has sold property around Little Tupper Lake for $1,917 to $9,000 an acre, but under the deal announced today, the family wound up selling the tract to the state for $1,161 an acre.
"Because of my love for this state and the memory of my late husband and his family, I have settled on a deal that I would normally not do," Mrs. Whitney said at a morning news conference in the State Capitol announcing the land sale. "Today, it is with a very heavy heart that I part with this portion of my land."
The deal drew praise from leaders of environmental groups, who described it as one of the most significant land purchases the state has made in the Adirondacks in several generations.
"The state has been buying land in the Adirondacks for years, but Whitney Park has always been the missing piece of the puzzle," said Neil F. Woodworth, a lobbyist for the Adirondack Mountain Club. "Now that we have this piece, the state's lands in the Adirondacks are finally linked."
But the deal also drew protests from business and community leaders in the Adirondacks, who believe that the state's drive to acquire land in the park is hurting the timber industry, the region's economic backbone. "We think that when New York State purchases the Whitney property and incorporates it into the forest preserve, we will lose a major resource that is used by people across the state and the nation, namely timber," said John Brodt, a spokesman for the Blue Line Council, a group that represents property owners and labor unions in the Adirondacks. "And you lose jobs."
For about a century, New York State has been acquiring property in Adirondack Park, which with six million acres within its borders is the largest public park in the contiguous United States. The state now owns 2.5 million acres of forest preserve that intermingles with more than 3 million acres of private land, including 110 villages, hamlets and towns.
But the state still faces huge hurdles in its efforts to preserve the Adirondack forest, including a recent decision by a timber company, Champion International Corporation, to sell off its 144,000 acres of North Country forest land. Environmental groups have lobbied the Governor to move quickly to preserve the land, either by buying it or working with Champion to find another timber company.
The state's last major land purchase in the Adirondacks was in 1988, when the administration of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo bought 15,419 acres from Lassiter Properties, a timber company. But that deal did not include a vast stretch of wilderness like the Whitney property. Rather, the state bought dozens of parcels scattered around six counties.
"The purchase of the Whitney property may be the most significant purchase of wilderness on the East Coast since World War II, when the state was buying up property in the high peaks of the Adirondacks," said Bernard Melewski, a lawyer for the Adirondack Council, a private group. "The Whitney property is, without question, the heart of possibly the greatest stretch of wilderness on the East Coast."
The Whitney property was once a vast estate three times the size of Manhattan. But over the years, small parts were sold off, and timber was taken from many stretches to pay taxes. Mrs. Whitney inherited the land four years ago with the death of her husband, a businessman who was a grandson of the original buyer of the land. Mrs. Whitney decided to subdivide and sell a nearly 15,000 stretch of the estate because property taxes had been mounting.
New York State intends to buy the property with money from two sources, the state's Environmental Protection Fund and the Environmental Bond Act that voters approved last year to pay for environmental projects around the state. The state will pay $13.9 million for a 14,700-acre tract that includes 10 lakes and ponds. It will also buy 80 acres of land on the north side of Little Tupper Lake that includes 26 buildings that are the headquarters for Whitney Industries. The sale is expected to be completed in June.
As part of the deal, a private group, the Adirondack Land Trust, will pay Whitney Industries $3 million in exchange for the company's pledge that it will not develop the remaining 36,000 acres for 10 years.

HEADLINE: Reversing Reservation's Pattern of Hard Drink and Early Death

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: PORCUPINE, S.D.

 BODY:
Cold winds as jagged as broken glass wail across barren fields and bumpy roads here in deepest South Dakota, an echo of the pain in the wretched, unforgiving land where Britton Kills Right, as a boy of 12, had burned two tattoos into his arms: "More Beer" and a sketch of the Grim Reaper.
"I wanted to drink," said Mr. Kills Right, now 22, "and I wanted to die." 
 But he has found reason to live. Sober now for nearly a year, Mr. Kills Right is part of a fast-growing sobriety movement among American Indians that uses healing programs, including sweat lodges, that are steeped in ancient ways.
At the same time, tribal officials have been aggressively promoting teachings that remind American Indians that alcohol was introduced to them by Europeans.
Tribal leaders say that the view of alcohol has changed starkly among the 26,000 residents of the American Indian Reservation at Pine Ridge, S.D., and on other reservations, especially among the young, with chapters of Students Against Drunk Driving growing rapidly. Here in Shannon County, politicians for tribal offices often post signs with the pronouncement, "A Sober Candidate."
But it is a fierce struggle. Indian children learn early that life is bitter, and brief, on the Pine Ridge reservation, one of the poorest places in the nation, where male life expectancy is 56.5 years, younger than anywhere else in the United States.
Burdened by poverty and suffering, their salvation from misery often comes in a bottle, ultimately a cruel hoax, as staggering rates of alcoholism contribute mightily to the early deaths.
Mr. Kills Right, who began drinking at 6, watched his 28-year-old mother die after being pushed through a window in a drunken brawl. He watched his grandmother drink herself into oblivion, night after night. A friend had a car accident while drunk, a wreck that left him brain dead, and another friend with a drinking problem committed suicide. He saw his father drink himself into a rage nightly, always looking for a fight, sometimes beating Britton.
"I drank beer, vodka, whisky, anything I could get, and when I didn't have any alcohol, I used mouthwash and cough syrup to get me drunk," Mr. Kills Right said. "And every day, I prayed for death."
He had been sitting in a jail cell, locked up for public drunkenness, when a man and a woman arrived and asked him whether he wanted to go with them, take a warm shower, eat a sandwich and drink a can of pop.
They were workers from Ampetu Luta Otipi, a treatment center whose name means "living in a red day," or "life in harmony with all things." There, Mr. Kills Right sat through a purification ceremony in a sweat lodge made of bended willow branches, prayed to the Creator, meditated and learned that great heroes like Crazy Horse had railed against drinking the white man's poison and warned that it would lead to devastation.
Richard Two Dogs, the medicine man at the treatment center, said young American Indians often assumed that drinking and despair had always defined their culture.
Many young men, Mr. Two Dogs said, have been taught to see intoxication as a rite of passage, that it takes a real man to be a hard drinker.
"I will ask a young man, 'What is Lakota?" Mr. Two Dogs said. "And he will reply, 'Lakota is to be poor. Lakota is to be alcoholic.' "
Then the medicine man will retort: "Lakota is a warrior! Lakota is proud!"
In other tribal lands, alcoholism treatment programs have been flourishing, sometimes run on a shoestring budget by volunteers, and sometimes financed with revenues from casino gambling.
The Oneida Tribe in Wisconsin, among others, used the casino windfall to build an alcoholism treatment center.
In South Dakota, civic leaders say that people who once saw drunkenness as an inevitable feature of life on the reservation have become more outspoken about the scourge.
"When you go to powwows or other public events," said Tim Giago, publisher of Indian Country Today, a Rapid City newspaper, "you just don't see open drunkenness like you once did. Our people are becoming more aware of our traditional ways and culture. And they're realizing that drunkenness was not part of it."
The success of such programs has yet to be measured. A recent Harvard University epidemiological study of life expectancy was based on 1990 figures. The study found that American Indian men in South Dakota die 15 years earlier than men elsewhere in the United States, who live to an average age of 71.66. American Indian women here live an average of 66.07 years, or nearly 14 years fewer than the national average.
Diabetes is common on the reservation, and some people live almost an hour's drive from a hospital. It seems that a vast majority smoke cigarettes. Fires kill the occupants of ramshackle homes with dangerous space heaters. People freeze to death alone in the darkness in winter.
Residents of Pine Ridge are more than four times likelier than people in the rest of the country to die in car accidents; a small minority use seat belts, and alcohol plays a part in most fatal wrecks.
Since the sale of alcohol on the reservation is forbidden, many people drive across the Nebraska border to a little town called Whiteclay, where liquor stores are crowded together and old rusted cars being stocked with liquor to take back to the reservation cause traffic jams.
Gene Thin Elk, an American Indian cultural adviser at the University of South Dakota and the leader of an alcoholism treatment program, said that there were some narrow, twisting roads on the plains that had become death traps for people who drink and drive.
"If you put up a wooden white cross for everyone that was killed on some of these roads," Mr. Thin Elk said, "it would look like a white picket fence for miles."
Mr. Thin Elk, whose Red Road to Recovery program has been used to help American Indians in 45 states and in Canada, said programs designed for other races often lost something in the translation for American Indians.
Even the use of the language differs in important ways, he said, when language, for Indians, shapes spiritual feelings and notions of wholeness. "When we meet someone, we say, 'Hello, cousin,' or 'Hello, Grandfather,' " Mr. Thin Elk said. "And this is not merely symbolic, but a reminder that we have a family."
The name of Mr. Thin Elk's program recalls the ancient meaning of two choices for native people: the black road, which leads to despair and death, and the red road, which leads to peace and harmony.
"Our trouble has been looking outward for solutions," said Mr. Thin Elk, 45, whose drinking cost him a marriage, but who said he had been sober for 17 years. "As a result, our people become lonely inside and disconnected with their people and customs."
Mr. Kills Right, who is unemployed, like more than half the Pine Ridge population, sat at a kitchen table in a modest ranch house built by the Government, with the winds howling outside and a dog barking under the stars.
"I had been to a white man's alcoholism treatment center at 16," said Mr. Kills Right, his jet black hair pulled back into a pony tail, his gaze intense and his fists clenched. "They had us do things like dance to Richard Simmons videos. They had us exercise to these songs I didn't know -- 'Sweating to the Oldies' -- that's what they called it."
A week after leaving the center, he was drinking again. He has been in jail dozens of times, usually for public drunkenness, sometimes for beating up white men.
It was a white man who pushed his mother through a window. And every time he saw a white man, he saw the face of her killer.
The Ampetu Luta Otipi treatment program, he said, was starkly different from the other alcoholism center.
"It felt like home," he said.
As he talked about his problems with workers at the center, they walked in the woods, meditated, prayed. They urged him to release his hatred against white people, against himself.
"Inside the sweat lodge, man, it felt like the safest place in the world," he said. "I cried. And I prayed. I said I don't want to drink no more. I don't want to feel bad no more. I want to prove I can be a good person. I cried and I cried hard."
These days, he said, he feels better than he knew possible. The medicine man, Mr. Two Dogs, and his wife, Ethleen Two Dogs, who is director of Ampetu Luta Otipi, have watched over him.
He said he no longer craved alcohol. One night, he sipped from a bottle of cola and filled out a job application to be a custodial worker at Pine Ridge Hospital.
"Now I am happy that I am here," Mr. Kills Right said. "I am grateful that I got to know who I am."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Debt Ratings Of 3 Nations In Asia Cut

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Asia's economic crisis deepened yesterday as one of the world's largest credit-rating agencies downgraded the sovereign debt of South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand to "junk" status, seriously impairing the countries' ability to raise the money needed to work through the region's wrenching downturn.
The downgrades from Moody's Investors Services Inc. hurt financial markets through most of Asia and helped push Japanese stocks to the lowest level since July 1995, but the worst damage was inflicted in South Korea, where stocks tumbled nearly 7 percent in early trading today and the currency, the won, tumbled nearly 15 percent, reaching a record low of nearly 2,000 to the dollar. 
 Those drops came after South Korean stocks fell 1.2 percent yesterday while the won fell 9.2 percent as news of the downgrades was first absorbed.
The reverberations from South Korea spilled into other Asia markets this morning, with stocks in Malaysia and the Philippines down nearly 2 percent. Markets in Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia were little changed.
In issuing the downgrades, Moody's said the region's prospects were further threatened by severe financial problems in Japan.
If Japan's economy was more robust, it might be able to play a stronger role in resolving the Asian turmoil. But, Moody's said, because Japan is also flailing, its consumers cannot provide a lift to Southeast Asian exports and its banks cannot increase the lending that is badly needed throughout the region.
Despite widespread relief that the International Monetary Fund and other international lenders have negotiated bailout packages with some countries, including South Korea, the downgrades are a numbing reminder that the troubles of Southeast Asia have deep roots and will not disappear soon.
More ominous, the downgrades mean the specter of wide-ranging and potentially disastrous defaults loom closer in a region that has gone from economic darling to financial pariah in a breathtakingly short period.
"One of the key things we have to recognize is that as they recover and try to issue new debt, these countries will be limited in the markets into which they can sell," said David Durrant, an analyst with IDEA, a financial consulting firm in New York.
The downgrades had been expected, but since the investment guidelines of most money managers prohibit them from holding junk-rated debt, the change in ratings caused a selloff of the debt yesterday.
The lowered ratings also mean that these big investors will not be buying new issues of such debt. South Korea, for one, had planned to issue $9 billion in new sovereign debt in January, but that plan is now threatened by questions over who would buy the securities and whether the interest rates would be prohibitively expensive for South Korea.
Moreover, while Moody's and other ratings agencies had issued less severe downgrades as the Asian crisis unfolded, this is the first time Moody's jointly downgraded a handful of countries in the region. Moody's also mildly downgraded Malaysia yesterday, while affirming ratings for China and Hong Kong.
To compound the pain, Moody's also lowered ratings on the corporate debt of banks, financial services concerns and other formerly blue-chip borrowers in South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand. Those actions included downgrading 5 Indonesian state banks; 11 Thai banks and financial services companies, and 20 Korean banks.
The Standard & Poor's Corporation, another large rating agency, added to the gloom by cutting South Korea's long-term foreign currency rating to junk status, saying that the country's liquidity position was "among the worst of rated sovereigns" and that the "external liabilities of the banking sector are twice the sector's external assets."
Although the world of debt ratings may seem arcane, the impact of a major downgrade is swift, unforgiving and very real. In much the same way that homeowners might have to cut back on groceries or scrimp on heating bills if forced to pay a higher interest rate on a mortgage, a country or a corporation is hurt when borrowing becomes more expensive. But such rate increases occur on a far-bigger scale and can quickly translate into defaults, bankruptcies, business closings and lost jobs.
The Korea Development Bank, the largest state-owned bank, recently canceled a $2 billion bond offering when it became apparent that potential investors would demand an interest rate of as much as 11 percent. But that rate, which seemed Draconian just a few weeks ago, now looks relatively cheap.
After the ratings cuts were announced, the interest rate on the Korea Development Bank's existing bonds due in 2006 shot up to about 12.7 percent, compared with about 11 percent on Friday. Some of the bank's bonds due in 2001 traded yesterday with interest rates ranging from 14.7 percent to 15.7 percent.
Even relative optimists have been quieted as Asia's financial drama plays out. Nancy Kimelman, chief economist for Thomson Financial Services Company, a Boston advisory firm, said she regarded the Asian situation as "guardedly good" because of the I.M.F.'s involvement, but, she added, "we haven't begun to see the termites in the woodwork."
Ms. Kimelman said she was particularly concerned about nonperforming loans, or those for which borrowers have stopped making payments. She said by some estimates as much as one-third of all loans in the region were nonperforming. Analysts said that in China alone, about 20 percent of all public and private loans were nonperforming.
Japan is by far the biggest source of loans to Asia, and defaults in the region pose the most dire threat to that country. Although only partial information is available, it appears that about half of all external debt in Southeast Asia is held by the Japanese, with a much smaller portion, between 10 percent and 20 percent held by lenders in the United States, according to Moody's.
Big American banks, with the exception of Citicorp, have a limited lending presence in Asia but offer only scattered disclosure about their exposure there. None of the banks would comment yesterday about their stance on reworking bad loans if Asia's economies deteriorated further and defaults increased. But even if overall exposure is limited, there are big loans in Asia that are proving troublesome for American banks.
For example, the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the largest American bank, has a complex $600 million loan to the South Korean consumer electronics giant Hyundai Electronics Industry. The loan was described as "troubled" by bankers who have done business with the company; these bankers insisted on anonymity. Chase declined to comment.
One of the most difficult challenges facing those trying to rework problem debt in Asia is the number and diversity of lenders and governments involved. In the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980's, the lenders were mainly large United States banks. Lenders in Asia today include banks as well as mutual funds like those of the Fidelity Investments unit of the FMR Corporation.
Some analysts said the crisis was still in its infancy. "Our argument is that six to nine months from now we will still be very much in the middle of this," Mr. Durrant of IDEA said. "People view the worst as being over, but we think it's still early stage."

Investors lost confidence in the creditworthiness of many Asian nations before the major credit rating agencies did, and sharply bid down the prices of their foreign-currency bonds. Yesterday, Moody's Investor Service began to catch up with the market by downgrading four nations, three of them to ratings below investment grade. Chart shows current ratings.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Next South Korean Leader Concedes Jobs Will Be Lost

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Tuesday, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Kim Dae Jung, the President-elect, partly reversed himself on Monday, conceding that workers at South Korean companies facing bankruptcy might lose their jobs.
Mr. Kim's changed stance seemed intended to appease foreign investors who fear that the pro-labor policies he championed to win the election last week could undermine the International Monetary Fund's financial rescue plan for South Korea. 
 Although Mr. Kim promised to support the I.M.F. plan late in the campaign, he said he preferred salary cuts instead of layoffs in any austerity measures. But the I.M.F.'s plan requires painful steps that are likely to put many debt-troubled Korean companies out of business. By some estimates, a million workers could lose their jobs.
"When businesses cannot save themselves from bankruptcy by reducing salaries, layoffs are inevitable," the President-elect said in a meeting Monday with David A. Lipton, the United States Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, who was here to discuss the South Korean financial crisis.
The meeting came against a backdrop of further deterioration in South Korea's economy and financial markets, as Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Services Inc. downgraded the nation's debt rating below investment grade, to junk bond status. Such downgrading make it far more difficult and expensive for South Korea to borrow.
Indeed, the main stock market index tumbled 7.50 percent, or 29.70 points at the close of trading today, to 366.36, after a 1.2 percent decline on Monday with the downgrading news. Stocks have lost more than 75 percent of their value in dollar terms so far this year.
The South Korean currency, the won, hemorrhaged further in midday trading, falling 12.68 percent to 1,964 to the dollar, compared with 1,710 on Monday and 1,550 on Friday. By comparison, it took 841 won to buy a dollar a year ago.
Seoul, fearing a default on its international debt that officials think would be catastrophic for the economy, would like expedited delivery of all $57 billion in loans that the I.M.F. has designated for relief. But the United States, the most influential member of the fund, has resisted that.
Mr. Lipton told the President-elect that his country's own rescue efforts should be stronger, according to Chang Che Shik, an economic adviser to Mr. Kim, who attended the meeting. Mr. Chang, a member of the South Korean Parliament, said the American official did not offer specific proposals. and Mr. Lipton could not be reached for comment.
In today's issue of The Chosun Ilbo, Mr. Kim, addressing a meeting of party officials on Monday, was quoted as saying, "We don't know whether we would go bankrupt tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. I can't sleep since I was briefed. I am totally flabbergasted."
A sense that other changes may be forthcoming to strengthen the aid package for South Korea was heightened not only by Mr. Lipton's arrival here, but also by that of Hubert Neiss, chief negotiator for the I.M.F. in the bailout agreement. Mr. Neiss said only that he was "working with authorities on the program."
An official at the South Korean central bank said Monday that usable foreign-exchange reserves were down to about $7 billion and that about $10 billion worth of debt denominated in foreign currency was payable by the end of this month.
The figures for both reserves and debt were lower than what Seoul had been reporting until now because some of the foreign exchange -- including $3.5 billion received from the I.M.F. since Friday -- had been used to pay down debt.
The central bank official said South Korea expected to receive $2 billion from the Asian Development Bank and perhaps $3 billion from the World Bank before the end of the month. In addition, he said, the maturity dates on some of the $10 billion due to foreign banks would be extended. That should allow the Koreans to avoid defaulting this month. But it would leave them with a few billion dollar of reserves in January, a dangerously low level, and more debt coming due then.
Seoul has been planning to raise money by issuing $10 billion in bonds. But with those bonds now carrying a junk rating, it will be much more difficult for the Government to find buyers, and it will have to offer very high interest rates to compensate for the riskiness.
To bolster its reserves to a level that can restore international confidence, Seoul is opening its markets wider to attract foreign capital.
Starting today, foreigners will be able to buy central and provincial government bonds as well as short-term corporate bonds with a maturity of less than three years.
A committee was formed on Monday to oversee the economy during the transition period until the new President takes office in February.

Clinton Urges Bosnians To Do Their Part for Peace
President Clinton urged Bosnian leaders in Sarajevo to do their part in creating peace in their war-ravaged country. He then visited a military base in Tuzla and praised American soldiers for their role as peacekeepers in an ongoing mission which he intends to extend. A1 

Czechs Are Cool on NATO
A new survey suggested that, despite the exhortations of President Vaclav Havel, fewer than half of Czechs surveyed support NATO membership for their country. The results, described by a Clinton Administration official as "not helpful," showed 42.8 percent of citizens supporting membership in the western alliance, 26.7 percent opposed and the remaining 30.5 percent undecided.

No Guest of Honor in Iraq
Iraq held a party at Saddam International Airport, closed under a United Nations embargo imposed in 1990 after the invasion of Kuwait. The festivities were planned to welcome Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the eccentric Russian nationalist who was in Baghdad less than three weeks ago. He was expected to defy the embargo to bring a delegation from the Russian Parliament and a symbolic shipment of food and medicine. But the plane never arrived. A4
 
A Step Forward for Somalia
The leaders of rival Somali factions met in Cairo and approved a plan intended to restore a national government to Somalia for the first time since the overthrow of a dictator in 1991 gave way to civil war. Delegates representing Somalia's various clans will gather next month to choose an interim government. A3
 
Turkey Expels Greek Diplomat
The Government of Turkey said it was expelling a Greek diplomat accused of spying. Greek officials denied the charges and said they would expel a Turkish diplomat in retaliation. Turkish newspapers reported that the Greek diplomat had been caught photographing military bases and seeking information deemed of use to Kurdish rebels. A5
 
No Indictment of Italy's Prodi
An Italian judge declined to indict Prime Minister Romano Prodi for abuse of office in the 1993 sale of Cirio-Bertolli, a food company, when he ran Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale, a huge state holding company. A prosecutor said that the company had been sold at an artificially low price. Mr. Prodi has always defended his innocence. (AP)
 
Five Charged in Israel
Five Israelis were charged with negligent homicide in the construction of a footbridge that collapsed July 14 at the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah Games, a Jewish Olympic-style sporting event, killing four Australian athletes. The engineer who designed the bridge, two contractors involved in its construction, the director of a company involved in staging the event and the chairman of the Maccabiah organizing committee were all indicted.

9 Charged With Smuggling Mexican Laborers to U.S.
Federal officials announced that they had broken a conspiracy in which Americans recruited hundreds of illegal Mexican workers and smuggled them into the United States to work in a T-shirt factory in Georgia. Officials from the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Justice Department said they had indicted nine members of the ring. Federal officials said hundreds of Mexican workers, most of them unmarried young men, were smuggled across the border in at least the last three years. A1
 
F.D.A. Approves Baldness Drug
The Food and Drug Administration announced that it had given Merck & Company permission to sell a drug that, experiments show, either promoted the growth of hair or at least stopped its loss in 83 percent of men who took it. But the pill, which will be marketed as a prescription medicine under the brand name Propecia, can cause birth defects, blocking approval for women, and it carries a slight risk of impotence in men. It is useful only for the genetic condition known as male pattern baldness and it must be taken once a day, every day, for the rest of a bald man's life. A1
 
Vietnam Pullout Was Planned
Declassified Pentagon documents may renew the argument over whether President John F. Kennedy would have pulled United States forces out of Vietnam. The documents show that shortly before President Kennedy was assassinated, the nation's top military leaders were going forward with the President's plan to withdraw United States advisers from Vietnam. No one will ever know whether these plans would have been carried out had Kennedy lived. The United States had 16,300 advisers in South Vietnam at the time. By the end of 1968, it had more than 500,000 soldiers in the country. A12
 
Kaczynski Jury Chosen
Nine women and three men were selected as jurors in Sacramento, Calif., to determine whether Theodore J. Kaczynski was the Unabomber and, if he was, whether he should be put to death. The jurors are anonymous by order of the judge. A12
 
Indictment in Delaware Murder
A Delaware grand jury indicted a lawyer, Thomas J. Capano, formally accusing him of murdering the governor's scheduling secretary in June 1996. Mr. Capano, 48, has been held without bail in solitary confinement since his arrest on Nov. 12. Two of his brothers, Louis Capano Jr. and Gerard Capano, gave statements to the authorities leading to his arrest on a charge he murdered his mistress, Anne Marie Fahey. (AP)

State Agrees to Purchase Major Tract in Adirondacks
Gov. George E. Pataki announced that the state has reached a landmark agreement to purchase nearly 15,000 acres of Adirondack wilderness that the Whitney family had planned to develop, while also protecting another tract twice that size for 10 years. The $17.1 million deal opens a pristine stretch of forests, streams and lakes -- including Little Tupper Lake, regarded by naturalists as one of the region's jewels -- to the public for the first time since William C. Whitney, the industrialist, bought the land for a family retreat a century ago. A1
 
Schools Still Run on Coal
More than a year after voters authorized the state to spend $125 million to replace 100 antiquated coal furnaces in schools, most of them located in New York City, not a single boiler has been converted to oil or gas. Officials from the New York State Power Authority said the designing and engineering had been time-consuming and cumbersome, and that the first 22 schools would be weaned off coal in time for next winter.

Kennedy Auction Scheduled
Six hundred items of Kennedy-era memorabilia will go on the auction block at the Park Avenue Armory March 18 and 19.

Kim Dae Jung, the President-elect of South Korea, partly reversed himself by conceding that workers for South Korean companies confronting bankruptcy may lose their jobs.

HEADLINE: T-Shirt Company Is Charged In Plot to Smuggle Mexicans

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Federal officials announced today that they had broken up a conspiracy in which Americans recruited scores of illegal Mexican workers and smuggled them into the United States to work in a T-shirt factory in Georgia.
Officials from the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Justice Department said they had indicted nine members of a smuggling ring, including Fred Lee Parrish, the president of Atlantic Finishing Inc., the American manufacturing company that agents said was importing the illegal workers. 
 Federal officials said that Mexican workers, most of them unmarried young men, were smuggled across the border over at least the last three years to work for Atlantic Finishing but that they did not know precisely how many.
The indictment said each Mexican paid the smugglers $1,000 each to be brought across the border and sent to Georgia.
Federal agents said the case was the first in which they had charged a company with conspiracy for bringing illegal workers from Mexico to a specific company in the United States. They said they believed that recruitment of workers in Mexico for sweatshops in the United States was not uncommon but that they had never before had evidence that linked all the pieces of such an operation.
Federal officials said they did not know how much the workers in this case had been paid or the conditions under which they worked. Those officials emphasized that the importance of the case was not to expose sweatshop conditions, but to expose business that trafficked in humans.
Mr. Parrish, reached at his home tonight in Chattanooga, Tenn., said of the charges, "They're totally false. Other than that, I can't say anything else."
Atlantic Finishing is based in Trenton, Ga., just across the state line from Chattanooga, and has a second plant in nearby Henagar, Ala. The company makes T-shirts for wholesalers, but the Government would not disclose the names of the company's customers beyond saying they had sold their wares to nationally known retailers.
Bill Marshall, president of the Chamber of Commerce in Dade County, Ga., where the plant is situated, said the company contracted with Kmart, among other retailers. He said that the plant had employed as many as 200 people, making it the county's second-largest employer but that in recent years it had had trouble finding people to sew. Mr. Marshall said employment was now down to about 50 people.
The case provided a rare window for law enforcement agents to observe the traffic in low-skill, low-wage workers, their recruitment, their being smuggled across the border and hidden in homes and motels and their transport across the South and their employment at substandard wages.
"We rarely have an opportunity to see the spectrum from start to finish of economic activity and the social pressures that exist in this country that serve to create the phenomenon that we are all so familiar with," said John J. Kelly, United States Attorney for the district of New Mexico, who announced the indictments in a conference-call news conference originating in Albuquerque.
Mr. Kelly said the case illustrated the basic law of demand and supply -- demand, in this case, for U.S. companies to manufacture goods cheaply to compete with those from overseas. He said the situation "has the effect of luring and recruiting Mexican and Latin American nationals across the international border into the United States."
Officials in the Union of Needletrade, Industrial and Textile Employees, the nation's largest union of garment workers, said they were unfamiliar with Atlantic Finishing, but they said many apparel factories employed illegal aliens.
Harris Raynor, the union's Atlanta-based assistant director for the southern region, said: "It's our belief that this kind of case is only the tip of the iceberg. In the current economic situation, the pressure on manufacturers to provide low-cost goods encourages sweatshop situations."
Mr. Raynor blamed the competitive economic market and American trade agreements for encouraging such activity.
"Ultimately," Mr. Raynor said, "if retailers don't take responsibility along with consumers for policing these issues, and as long as our Government -- through programs like Nafta, with no worker or environmental protections -- keeps pushing the edge of the economic envelope, we will see more and more of these situations."
Federal agents were tipped off to the ring a year ago, when they stopped a Ford van crammed with 11 illegal aliens at a checkpoint near Hatch, N.M., about 40 miles north of El Paso.
The investigation that ensued was labeled "I-25 Confederation/Dixie Junction," referring to the interstate that many immigrants travel north through New Mexico, and involved agents from several offices, including the Border Patrol, the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Marshal's Office.
Once the workers for Atlantic Finishing reached Albuquerque, they were housed and smuggled east along Interstate 40 through Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, agents said.
William Veal, chief of the border patrol for the El Paso section of the border, said that his agents had caught 61,000 illegal immigrants last year crossing the border into New Mexico and that many of them were headed for the "interior" of the United States, suggesting that work was available for them.
"Make no mistake about the people involved," Mr. Veal said of the current case. "They are involved in the business of exploitation." He called this an example of the increasing sophistication of smugglers, who are ever more eager to supply American companies with low-wage workers.
"I've never seen a case that took people from recruitment to a pre-determined destination with jobs lined up," Mr. Veal said.
Officials said their investigation included wiretaps and undercover agents.
The indictment said Mr. Parrish, 49, recruited the workers and paid others who actually smuggled them across the border. It said the company hired them under false names and instructed them into how to fill out employment documents using assumed names.
The Chattanooga Region Manufacturers' Directory for 1997 said the company was established in 1987 and employed 160 workers in 40,000 square feet of space.
Mr. Parrish was arrested on Thursday at his factory in Trenton and released on bond. He was charged with conspiracy to transport and harbor illegal aliens, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.
The maximum fine for the company, also named as a defendant, is $500,000. His relatives said he was to appear in court in New Mexico on Dec. 29.
In addition to Mr. Parrish, those indicted were: Barbara Lee Blevins of Henagar, Ala.; Linda Sue Barrett of Trenton, Ga.; Saul Resendiz-Cortes of Dalton, Ga.; Esau Ocampo-Cortes of Dalton, Ga.; Abisneigo Resendiz-Cortes of Trenton, Ga.; Rachel Resendiz of Dalton, Ga.; Josie Reyes of Las Cruces, N.M., and Francisco Lopez-Garcia of Rodey, N.M.
They were all charged with conspiracy to transport and harbor illegal aliens, and some face additional charges. Some are Americans, some are illegal aliens and some are legal permanent residents.

HEADLINE: New Poll Finds Czechs' Support for NATO Stays Below 50%

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Fewer than half the Czechs support NATO membership for their country, even though President Vaclav Havel has often spoken about the importance of the Western alliance, according to a survey released here today.
The survey suggests that Czechs are more concerned with their economic well-being, which they feel is threatened by domestic political upheavals, than with any external threat that NATO is intended to thwart. 
 This was the third of four surveys this year by the Factum polling company that showed less than 50 percent support for membership in the alliance; today's results showed 42.8 percent.
The results, which a Clinton Administration official described today as "not helpful," came two months after Washington told the Czech Government that it was dissatisfied with its preparations for NATO.
Enthusiasm for NATO membership has been muted in the Czech Republic all along, and lagged behind the level of support in the two other Central European countries, Poland and Hungary, that have been invited to join.
The Clinton Administration considers the embrace of the three formerly Communist countries by NATO as the centerpiece of its European policy but has been nervous about the lethargic attitude in the Czech Ministry of Defense. This has been particularly difficult for the Administration to deal with because Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who was born in Czechoslovakia, has made no secret of her aspirations for the Czech Republic.
During several visits by high-level Pentagon officials in October, the Government was told to sharpen its preparation for membership. Debate on the expansion of NATO began in the United States Senate in the fall, and the issue is expected to be voted on next spring. A two-thirds majority is necessary for passage in the Senate, and approval by the parliaments of the 15 other NATO members is also needed before enlargement can move ahead.
Administration officials warned the Czechs that tepid public opinion and an ill-prepared military would not help their cause in the Senate.
To please the Administration, the Government of Vaclav Klaus, who was forced to resign as Prime Minister last month, increased military spending this fall. The Defense Ministry also made personnel changes.
But Mr. Klaus and his other ministers rarely discussed the importance of NATO with the public.
The results of today's survey showed that President Havel, virtually the only passionate proponent of NATO membership among Czech officials, has had little impact on public opinion. Jan Herzmann, managing director of Factum, said in an interview today that the results reflected "lack of discussion of NATO."
Those who remain undecided are still a substantial group -- 30.5 percent -- and 26.7 percent said they were opposed to the expansion, Mr. Herzmann said. The margin of sampling error for all four polls is plus or minus 2 percent.
A survey conducted in the spring showed peak support of 50.1 percent, Mr. Herzmann said. A survey in April showed 39.9 percent support, and in June support dipped to a low of 37.4 percent.
In a recent interview the Deputy Defense Minister, Jaromir Novotny, said: "For the first time in this century, the geographical position of the Czech Republic is to our advantage. People feel safe."

Technology Stock Rebound Helps Stop Four-Day Slide
Stocks in the United States ended higher for the first time since Dec. 16 despite fears about the consequences of Asia's worsening financial crisis. Renewed interest in technology stocks and buying related to a number of new corporate takeover deals helped arrest the market's decline. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 63.02 points, to 7,819.31. The Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted with technology stocks, rose 7.32 points, or half of 1 percent, to 1,532.06, led by a 2 percent gain in Intel. But the company's shares are still down 29 percent from their Aug. 20 peak. Page D8.
 
In Japan, stocks fell to the weakest level since July 1995 yesterday on growing alarm over the economic frailties in the country and broader Asia, particularly the threat of defaults on debts that could hurt Japanese banks. Financial markets in Japan are closed today for a national holiday. D4.
 
Korean Leader Now Sees Layoffs
Kim Dae Jung, the President-elect of South Korea, partly reversed himself and conceded that workers in companies facing bankruptcy might lose their jobs. Mr. Kim's changed position seemed intended to appease foreign investors who feared that his pro-labor policies would subvert the I.M.F.'s rescue plan for South Korea. D4.
 
Luxury goods makers have been severely hurt by the problems in Asia, which up until a few months ago was a major source of demand among the affluent for items ranging from Clergerie shoes to Luis Vuitton handbags. While luxury sales in Tokyo have remained mostly steady, sales in the rest of Asia have ranged from spotty to downright miserable over the last few months. Shares of Gucci, maker of the dress at left, have fallen 45 percent since June. B7.
 
28th Acquisition for Tyco
Acquiring companies almost as fast as others have been shedding them, Tyco International agreed to buy the medical products unit of American Home Products for $1.77 billion in cash. It was the 28th acquisition announced or completed this year by Tyco. D2.
 
American International Group, seeking to increase sales to individual customers in the United States and Latin America, said it would purchase American Bankers Insurance Group for $2.2 billion. D3.
 
Nasdaq Plans New Ways to Trade
Investors would have new ways to buy and sell stocks under a plan filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the National Association of Securities Dealers, parent of Nasdaq. The plan, known as Next Nasdaq, would mark the latest in a series of changes to sweep over the Nasdaq market, home to the stocks of many small companies. D2.
 
Merck's Baldness Drug Approved
The Food and Drug Administration gave Merck & Company permission to sell Propecia, which experiments show promoted growth of hair or stopped hair loss in 83 percent of men who took it. A1.
 
French Cousin for Coke's Fanta
Coca-Cola is purchasing Orangina, the carbonated orange soft drink made by Pernod-Ricard of France for $840 million, the first major acquisition for the company since Douglas Ivestor became chief executive two months ago. Orangina, less sweet than Coke's Fanta brand, has been a strong rival to the leading soft-drink maker in the French market but is not widely sold in the North American market. D3.

Big Stakes in Box Office Madness
Hollywood's emphasis on making a film a success in its first weekend at the box office may seem like madness. The economics of marketing, however, now powerfully favors nationwide openings in thousands of theaters instead of gradually building a movie's following a few cities at a time. E1.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 25, 1997, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An entry in the Business Digest on Tuesday for an article about Coca-Cola's proposed purchase of Orangina misspelled the surname of the chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola. He is Douglas Ivester, not Ivestor.

HEADLINE: London Pubs Sip The Tonic Of Youth

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
WITH platform shoes, warm-up pants, a head wrap and a tie-dyed T-shirt knotted at the waist, the goateed and mustachioed waiter at the Engineer, one of London's new-wave pubs, was making a fashion statement aimed directly at his customers.
On a mild evening, the street in front of the pub in Primrose Hill was jammed with young people drinking their pints and chardonnays. Inside, waiters and waitresses were rushing or sauntering through the dining room carrying the most unpublike food: not a cheese roll in sight, but plenty of grilled chicken, polenta and fish cakes with Thai seasoning, as well as a curious combination of watermelon chunks and feta cheese. 
 The chef, it turned out, was an American -- Robert Greenway, from Philadelphia -- but meals at five similar pubs proved that the nationality of the cook was of no importance: London's hip young chefs are trying a little bit of everything, from Greece and China to India and the United States, with a bit of kangaroo thrown into the mix.
In other words, modern British. The working man used to nursing a pint of ale at a grotty pub with sticky carpets and soot-covered ceilings is finding that the carpets are new, the ceilings painted and in his place are young men in double-breasted pinstripes or torn T-shirts (sometimes on Rollerblades) and women in minimalist granny dresses. In London-speak the gastro-pub has been taken over by trustafarians: rich young people dressed down or up. The Time Out Guide to Eating and Drinking in London reports: "The pub revolution has swept through the capital with such speed it's not uncommon to find distressed pubgoers returning from holiday to find their old local no longer looking local. Someone has put up a blackboard wine list where the dartboard used to be, the new landlord is half the age of the previous one, and the place is now full of the sort of people that swore they'd never be seen dead in a pub."
Bad bangers and mash and soggy steak-and-kidney pie are things of the past, beaten down by Mediterranean, Pacific Rim and fusion cooking.
The word on the street is that hotels and fancy restaurants are having trouble finding help, as young chefs have been choosing to cook in their own informal surroundings instead of spending years in someone else's kitchen.
No one knows how many of London's 6,000 pubs qualify as gastro, but politics has played a significant role in their rejuvenation.
In 1988, the Government ruled that a few large breweries owned too many pubs, and those that had more than 2,000 in Britain were forced to sell half of the number over 2,000 by the end of 1992. It was the middle of a recession, and real estate prices were low, so there were a lot of good buys.
Today, the pubs that were sold off are owned by individuals and pub operating companies, and they are changing the ambiance rapidly. Even those pubs still owned by breweries are hiring managers who know something about good food (though the selection of beers may be limited to the brewery brands). Along with the sell-off, the opening hours for pubs were extended.
The Government's deaccession decision came at just the right moment in British food history.
During the previous 10 years, British chefs had begun to throw off their reputation for boring, overcooked nursery food and had taken their places in the culinary firmament with pricey, world-class restaurants. Now, they were ready to improve the lot of those more or less well off.
Pubs for lease or sale in areas that were being gentrified, like Notting Hill, northwest of Kensington Gardens, were just the ticket for young chefs who could not afford the $150,000 it takes to open a restaurant from scratch. Pubs come with bars, tables and chairs and some sort of kitchen, even if all it was ever used for was heating up frozen steak-and-kidney pies.
For around $45,000, David Eyre, a self-taught chef, and his partner, Michael Belbin, took over an 1890's Victorian pub and opened the Eagle, keeping the pubby look with traditional raised-pattern wallpaper, large, uncurtained windows and bare floors. The dishes and cutlery are mismatched; so are the tables and chairs.
"Seven years ago, we took a terrible risk," said Mr. Eyre, 36. "It was about the only thing we could afford. I used a credit card for a down payment, and shortly after, they took it away from me. Now it's a normal thing for people our age to get the money together and open a pub. Seven or eight years ago in the pub business, all you needed to do was serve something decent."
The standards, said Mr. Belbin, 45, "were so low because the pub was the only place you could get a drink without having to order food, so they didn't have to bother with food."
Now there is plenty of competition, and gastro-pubs are on the increase. It isn't just their food that makes them so appealing; it's their prices: half or less of what a similar meal would cost in a decent restaurant, or $35 to $40, with a glass a wine.
At the Eagle, which is on Farringdon Road in Clerkenwell, where warehouses are turning into lofts and art galleries are thriving, the accent is on the Olive Oil Belt, with the best pappa al pomodoro I have ever eaten.
The secret to this hearty tomato-bread soup is all in the kind of canned tomatoes you use, Mr. Eyre said, adding, "What we're really good at is robust, fairly crude, big-flavored food."
What none of these pubs is particularly good at is order.
Roderick Marley, a camera technician, finds the service at the Anglesea Arms near Hammersmith "quite chaotic." He remembers waiting so long for dinner that he and his companion consumed two bottles of wine. "You have to be patient, but it's very good value," he said.
The pub serves new and old-fashioned cafe food like a foie gras and pigeon terrine, grilled sardines and couscous and a quite nice polenta cake served with berry juice and ice cream.
Most pubs do not take reservations, and particularly at lunch, would-be diners cruise the room looking for empty seats at already occupied tables. Between noise from the kitchen, which is often part of the dining room, and the canned music, the decibels are pretty high. The system of ordering food at the bar and then being served at a table adds to the confusion, especially since the serving staff is not what would be called highly trained. With lots of people shouting to be heard over the din and the cloud of blue-gray smoke that hangs over the room (a growing number of pubs are either smoke-free or have no-smoking areas), those looking for a quiet leisurely meal should choose to eat elsewhere.
Seated at a table at the Anglesea Arms, Mr. Marley's wife, April, a fashion buyer for the Harvey Nichols department store, said: "We've been coming since it opened. After a hard day at work, it's certainly easier than cooking at home."
In response to the frequent complaint about reservations, the next phase in gastro-pubs has already begun: at the Engineer reservations are not only accepted but advisable. The Ladbroke Arms, which has been serving good food in Notting Hill Gate since 1990, has plans for a new dining room that will accept reservations. Does that mean the Ladbroke Arms will be just another restaurant?
"No, no," said Ian Mackenzie, who owns this and three other pubs. "I like the environment of a traditional British pub -- warm and welcoming. Pubs are inherently lovely. This is the sort of place I would take my grandmother to."
The accent at the Ladbroke is definitely Mediterranean, with a superb rendition of three Greek favorites (taramosalata, tzatziki and hummus); a meltingly warm goat cheese salad with chutney on toast and bright, crisp greens, and the very British banoffi pie, a gooey mix of toffee and banana in a fine crust. As three of us poured cream over it, we repeated the same mantra: "Ummm. I'm glad I didn't like it." And promptly polished it off.
 
PAN-FRIED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH CRISPY POLENTA, GUACAMOLE AND TOMATO SALSA
 
Adapted from the Engineer, London
 Total time: 40 minutes
 
 1 1/2 cups instant polenta
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
 1/2 cup coarsely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper
 3 small ripe avocados, skinned and pitted
 4 tablespoons lime juice
 1 small red onion, finely diced
 2 jalapeno or serrano chilies, seeded and minced
 2 tablespoons fresh coriander leaves plus 4 coriander sprigs
 1 tablespoon olive oil
 4 large chicken breasts, halved
 8 ripe plum tomatoes
 4 scallions, finely chopped
 2 large heads arugula.
1. Bring 6 cups of water to a boil. Carefully whisk in the polenta to prevent lumps from forming. Reduce the heat, and continuously stir the mixture until it thickens (just a couple of minutes). Remove from the heat, and stir in the butter and cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon into a greased 9-by-13-inch baking dish, and spread evenly with a spatula. Allow to cool. Refrigerate, if making ahead.
2. For the guacamole, puree the avocados with the lime juice in a food processor. Stir in the onion, a quarter to a half of the minced chilies and the coriander leaves. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate, if making ahead.
3. When ready to serve, heat the olive oil in a large nonstick pan. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and brown over high heat. Turn, and brown on the other side. Reduce the heat to medium-high, and cook the chicken until it is done, a total of about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Meanwhile, make the salsa. Trim the tomatoes, quarter them and place in the food processor along with the coriander sprigs, scallions and the remaining minced chilies (or less to taste). Process until coarse. Season with salt and pepper.
5. When ready to brown the polenta, preheat the broiler. Turn out the polenta from its dish onto an oiled baking sheet, and place under the hot broiler until the surface begins to puff and brown, 3 to 5 minutes. The polenta can broil while chicken is cooking.
6. In center of a plate, place a pool of salsa. Place the polenta on top of the salsa. Arrange a few arugula leaves on the side; place a piece of chicken on the arugula, and top the chicken with guacamole.
Yield: 8 servings.
Note: Because of the lime juice, the guacamole will not brown, so it can be made a day ahead, along with the polenta.

PAPPA AL POMODORO
 
Adapted from the Eagle, London
Total time: 1 hour
 
 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus additional oil for topping (optional)
 4 large cloves garlic, crushed
 1 2-pound-3-ounce can best-quality Italian tomatoes
 8 ounces stale Italian or sourdough bread, torn into 1-inch pieces
 6 cups chicken or vegetable stock
 30 or more basil leaves
 Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
1. Heat the olive oil in a large pot, and saute the garlic for about 30 seconds, just until it colors. Do not let it burn.
2. Add the tomatoes, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes, until the mixture thickens.
3. Add the bread and stock, and cook slowly for 30 minutes longer. The mixture should be lumpy and thick.
4. Add the basil, remove from the heat and allow to sit for at least 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Serve warm in winter and at room temperature in summer. Pour the soup into bowls, and top with additional oil, if desired.
Yield: 5 servings.
Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 325 calories, 15 grams fat, 8 milligrams cholesterol, 745 milligrams sodium, 10 grams protein, 35 grams carbohydrate.
 
GRILLED SWORDFISH WITH PESTO-LEMON-CAPER SAUCE
 
Adapted from the Lansdowne, London
 
Total time: 25 minutes
 
 1 1/2 large bunches flat-leaf parsley
 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
 Juice of 1 lemon
 Grated rind from 2 lemons
 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
 1 cup diced red onion
 2 tablespoons capers
 1/3 cup chopped cornichons
 8 anchovy fillets, dried on paper towels
 6 swordfish steaks, 1-inch-thick
 Olive oil for grilling.
1. In the bowl of a food processor, combine all of the ingredients except the swordfish and the olive oil for grilling, and process until coarsely chopped.
2. Rub the swordfish with olive oil, and grill on both sides until cooked, following the Canadian rule: measure at thickest point, and allow 8 to 10 minutes to the inch, turning once. Serve topped with the pesto-lemon-caper sauce.
Yield: 6 servings.
Note: This dish is also delicious with grilled chicken breasts.
 
Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 550 calories, 35 grams fat, 95 milligrams cholesterol, 635 milligrams sodium, 45 grams protein, 5 grams carbohydrate.

HEADLINE: Middle-Class Education

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Joseph L. Bruno, the New York Senate majority leader, wants to return New York State's 1998 budget surplus in the form of an array of tax cuts estimated at close to $1 billion (news article, Dec. 17). Better Mr. Bruno look to plug a wallet-drainer that affects thousands of college students and middle-income parents: skyrocketing public college tuition costs. 
 New York public tuition costs have risen by more than 150 percent in the last decade, the fastest growing in the country, while critical financial aid has been whittled down. If Mr. Bruno really wants to improve New York's economy and quality of life, he should seek to invest the surplus in education, the best bet for a better future, by reducing the cost of higher education.

HEADLINE: Talk of Japan Intervention Depresses Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar declined against the yen yesterday on speculation that the Japanese central bank would sell dollars to strengthen the yen in coming days, taking advantage of thin holiday trading. The dollar also eased against European currencies.
Analysts estimate that the Bank of Japan spent between $5 billion and $10 billion last week defending the yen, which is down 11.5 percent against the dollar this year. 
 "There is speculation of B.O.J. intervention over the next two, three days," said Richard Gilhooly, a strategist for Paribas Capital Markets. "They can push the market any way they want in thin trading. So for people holding dollars over the holiday, there's a risk."
While most markets will be closed tomorrow for Christmas, Japan's will remain open.
In New York trading yesterday, the dollar settled at 129.22 yen, down from 130.13 yen late Monday. The dollar cost 1.7755 German marks, down from 1.7810 marks. It declined, as well, against the British pound, which sold at $1.6656, compared with $1.6633 on Monday.
Despite yesterday's declines, many in the currency markets expect the dollar to rise because of worsening financial crises in Asia, including a severe cash shortage in South Korea and the prospect of more corporate failures in Japan.
"The bankruptcy news is bad for the yen, not to mention that Korea collapsed," said Richard Koss, market strategist at MFR Inc., a money management and consulting firm.

HEADLINE: Chinese Democracy Campaigners Push for Free Labor Unions

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 23

 BODY:
A loose-knit group of veteran democracy advocates has started a campaign to promote independent labor unions among China's workers, who face vast layoffs as the Government strives to close money-losing enterprises.
The advocates, some in China and some in exile, hope to use Beijing's recent signing of a United Nations covenant insuring the right of workers to organize as a wedge against a Government that has suppressed all efforts to form unions outside its grip. 
 In a letter sent this week to foreign news organizations, the campaigners say workers now have a clear right to set up new unions to fight for their interests in this period of drastic downsizing, mergers and sales of state-owned industries. Currently, unions not sponsored by the Communist Party are illegal, and the Government has given no sign that it will relent, United Nations covenant or not.
The proposals in the letter go to the heart of China's most explosive political challenge: how to cope with the legions of victims as it unleashes market forces to streamline the bloated, often bankrupt Communist economy.
In recent months, there have been numerous reports of small-scale worker protests around the country over such concerns as nonpayment of wages or pensions, fear of job losses after corporate takeovers, and conflicts over dismissals and severance pay.
The dislocation of millions of industrial workers is occurring even as the growing private and semiprivate sectors bring new prosperity to millions of other Chinese -- a visible gap that only adds to the tensions.
"Workers in state-owned enterprises, especially, should immediately form their own unions to monitor their leaders and prevent leaders from engaging in bribery or stealing public properties," said the letter, signed by four leaders of the 1979 "Democracy Wall" movement, each of whom has served time in prison. "Only by depending on ourselves can we fight those who punish workers arbitrarily or fire workers without reason."
In a telephone interview from Cambridge, Mass., Wang Xizhe, one of the signers, said: "China's workers don't understand that China has agreed to this international agreement. We're going to use every method we can to educate them about it."
Mr. Wang, 49, who spent 15 years in prison for earlier pro-democracy activities, fled China last year under threat of arrest after he signed a letter calling for impeachment of President Jiang Zemin.
The agreement in question is the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966, which China's United Nations representative, Qin Huasun, signed in New York on Oct. 26, just before President Jiang visited the United States. The covenant is one of two that Washington had urged China to sign to improve its human rights record.
The covenant guarantees "the right of everyone to form trade unions and join the trade union of his choice." But the agreement adds that the right is subject to restrictions "prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others." China could easily cite these loopholes.
Because of tight Government control of the press, few people here may learn directly about the pro-union letter, which is dated Dec. 20. But Mr. Wang said many people around China were spreading the message through the Internet and private channels. He said the group also hoped that foreign radio news broadcasters, who are widely listened to here, would take note.
Mr. Wang added that the signers were only trying to raise awareness, not organize unions, something he said workers must do themselves.
The distinction may be a crucial one for the two signers inside China, Qin Yongmin in Wuhan and Xu Wenli in Beijing, who have served long prison terms in the past. Reached by telephone today, both declined to expand on the letter. The fourth signer, Lu Siqing, lives in Hong Kong.
"Organizing a labor union is no longer an internal affair of China," Mr. Wang asserted. "It is an internationally protected right," a suggestion that the glare of global oversight might deter Government crackdowns.
In a nod to the Government's problems, the letter expresses firm support for economic restructuring and blames earlier Maoist policies for causing the current muddle. It says workers need to accept inevitable hardships to create a sounded economy and should resort to protests and strikes only as a last resort.
Official statistics put urban unemployment at less than 4 percent, but tens of millions more workers are effectively unemployed, sent home to receive perhaps $20 or $25 a month. Some bankrupt industries have failed to meet even those obligations.
Western experts say the effective rate of unemployment in many large cities ranges above 20 percent, although many former workers retain heavily subsidized housing.
The Government is struggling to build new unemployment insurance, welfare and pension programs to replace the old "iron rice bowl," the guarantee of lifelong security for state employees.
But as it tries to create a less costly safety net, the Government has also taken to hectoring workers to lower their expectations. An article last week in People's Daily, the official Communist Party paper, said laid-off workers needed to learn from the example of migrant peasants, who have flooded into cities often to perform menial jobs like collecting garbage, selling food in the street and washing windows.
"These new job explorers in the cities, these former farmers, have actually brought new concepts to urban workers who got used to eating from one big pot under the old system," the article said. "So some experts say that urban workers should learn from their rural counterparts in looking for jobs."

HEADLINE: Economic Data Suggest a Slowing Trend

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
More evidence of slackening economic growth emerged today even as the Government reported that orders for relatively costly factory goods posted the biggest gain in almost five years in November.
The surge in orders was concentrated in commercial aircraft and military hardware, produced over extended periods. But new orders for items other than transportation equipment were lower for the second consecutive month. 
 "We're going to see a profound slowing in the economy in early 1998," said Richard B. Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
He and other analysts said financial and economic turmoil in Asia had dimmed prospects for American exports to that region while making Asian products cheaper here.
Indeed, today's Commerce Department report of a 4.8 percent jump in orders for durable goods also showed that orders for machinery used in production, about half of which are sold abroad, fell 2 percent in November after a 2.1 percent October decline.
This category, which excludes planes and the military, is considered a good gauge of corporate America's view of business prospects.
Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said the November decline in orders for capital goods "may be among the first signs that the Asian crisis is hitting home."
In another sign of weakness, the University of Michigan told subscribers to its survey of consumer confidence that it had lowered the index reading for December to 102.1 from an initial 103, deepening the already sharp drop from 107.2 in November. The expectations component, now 96.1, has been particularly weak in the last two months.
In a second report by the Commerce Department, the Government lowered the economy's growth in the third quarter to an annual rate of 3.1 percent. This is still a bit higher than most analysts think is sustainable but less than the 3.3 percent pace calculated last month and the 3.5 percent initially estimated in October.
The reduction in the growth rate of the gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and services within the nation's borders -- reflected a trimming of most major components.
For example, personal consumption, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's $7.2 trillion annual G.D.P., grew at a 5.6 percent rate, a still-torrid pace but down from the 5.8 percent estimated a month earlier.
Corporate profits, however, were revised higher. The increase in profits from current production for the summer quarter is now put at $32.2 billion, or 4 percent, instead of a gain of $21.1 billion, or 2.7 percent, initially reported last month. The bulk of the revision reflected higher foreign earnings, initially estimated as far weaker.
"While profits are likely to slow in coming quarters -- both domestic and foreign -- a collapse is unlikely as long as domestic growth holds up," said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at Morgan Guaranty.
The tally of orders for durable goods -- everything from camcorders to artillery pieces, all intended to last at least three years -- showed a 20.3 percent advance for transportation equipment. Without that, orders would have declined two-tenths of 1 percent.
Orders for primary metals climbed 3.2 percent last month but those for electronic and electrical equipment were virtually unchanged and those for industrial machinery and equipment dropped 1.6 percent.
Orders for military goods, much of them also counted in transportation, leaped 24.9 percent, more than offsetting a 13.5 percent October drop.
Shipments of durable goods eased four-tenths of 1 percent in November, to $182.9 billion, the third decline in four months, the report showed. Unfilled orders rose 2.4 percent, the sixth increase in seven months.

HEADLINE: Merrill Settles With County for $1.9 Million

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., Dec. 23

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch agreed today to pay $1.9 million to settle a securities fraud class-action suit brought on behalf of Orange County, Calif., bondholders in the wake of county bankruptcy in 1994.
The suit charged Merrill and other firms with misleading investors about the financial health and risks of the county investment pool. 
 Orange County suffered the nation's largest municipal bankruptcy, accumulating roughly $1.6 billion in losses by making wrong bets on the direction of interest rates, using highly leveraged transactions.
"All of the bonds in which we were involved have been fully repaid," a spokesman for Merrill Lynch said today. "It made more sense to resolve the case for a reasonable sum than to continue the expense and distraction of further litigation."
Other defendants who agreed to settle the suit and their payments included Credit Suisse First Boston, $990,000; KPMG Peat Marwick, $225,000, and Leifer Capital, $30,000.
A hearing on the settlement has been scheduled on Feb. 16 before Judge William McDonald in California Superior Court here.
The suit covers investors who purchased the bonds, notes or other securities between July 1, 1992, and Dec. 6, 1994, issued by the county or other public entities that invested in the county's investment pool.

HEADLINE: There's Been No Rush for Medical Savings Accounts, but Idea Is Gaining Favor

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Republicans believe medical savings accounts are a sensible way to cut health insurance costs for the Government and private employers, to provide more affordable coverage for those who are uninsured and to help consumers save money.
Democrats, though, see these accounts -- which involve tax-free savings and low-cost, high-deductible medical insurance -- as a tax break for the healthy and wealthy and a potential trap for unwary workers and some of the elderly. 
 Unable to resolve their differences, President Clinton and Congress agreed in 1996 to begin a four-year pilot project this year to determine how medical savings accounts would work in practice, as opposed to theory. Beginning next year, the project will be expanded to include a limited number of retirees covered by Medicare.
The test in the private market has been under way for a year, and the early returns are in. They show that far fewer people than Republicans hoped or Democrats feared have decided to participate. But there is evidence the idea may be picking up steam.
"Expectations of rapid growth may simply have been unrealistic," concluded the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress. But in a draft of a report that was sent to Congress this month but has not been made public, the auditing agency added, "Insurers indicated that sales have been steadily increasing over the past few months."
Here is how medical savings accounts work:
Consumers buy (or their employers or the Government, in the case of Medicare, pay for) relatively inexpensive medical insurance that covers them fully against very expensive illness or injury. But this medical insurance pays nothing for as much as the first $2,250 in annual medical expenses for individuals or $4,500 for families.
Edwin Hustead, an actuary here who studies medical insurance, said that the premiums for such policies were generally about 25 percent lower than premiums for conventional insurance with low deductibles or managed-care plans.
For some, the saving may be even more. Joan Jacobson, an employee benefits consultant in San Francisco, said that for a single person under 30 in her area, a high-deductible plan cost only $51 a month, 40 percent less than the $85 a month for a Blue Cross policy.
Part of the money saved from the lower premiums is placed in a tax-free account in the consumer's name, somewhat like an individual retirement account or a 401(k) retirement plan.
The money in the account can be invested and allowed to accumulate from year to year. It can be withdrawn without owing taxes to meet uncovered medical expenses -- not just doctor and hospital bills up to the deductible, but even the cost of treatments like cosmetic surgery, dental care and psychological counseling not covered by ordinary medical insurance.
Consumers can also withdraw the money for nonmedical purposes, but then it is taxed and subject to an additional 15 percent penalty.
Such accounts could be a good deal for healthy people or those affluent enough that they do not have to worry about unexpected out-of-pocket medical costs. Government statistics show that each year about 10 percent of Americans incur 70 percent of all medical expenses. Even among the elderly, 17 percent of those covered by Medicare in a typical year do not file a single claim.
But people who are less well-off could be devastated if they took the risk that they would not get sick and were hit with doctor and hospital bills that were several thousand dollars more than what had accumulated in their savings account.
And some experts in the economics of health care worry that if enough healthy people sign up for medical savings accounts, the result would be much higher premiums for people and companies that stick with ordinary insurance policies.
When lawmakers set up the test program last year, the White House feared that so many people might sign up that the Government would suffer a significant loss of tax revenue, so strict limits were imposed.
The only people eligible are those who are self-employed or who work for companies with fewer than 50 employees. The law specified that no more than 525,000 medical savings accounts would be allowed nationally in the first six months of this year.
Many fewer people than that have signed up. The Internal Revenue Service found that only 22,051 accounts had been set up by June 30. Of those, 3,670, or 17 percent, were opened by people who had not previously been insured.
The General Accounting Office found that consumers had been cautious because of "the complexity of the product and a lack of understanding" about how medical savings accounts worked. The audit also discovered that many insurance brokers and agents were not selling the policies aggressively because the sales pitch for a new product took time and because commissions on low-premium insurance are less than commissions on conventional policies.
But proponents have taken heart in the fact that twice as many accounts were opened in May and June as in the first four months of the year. Many more have been opened since then. American Banker magazine reported last month that its survey had found that about 100,000 accounts had been opened nationwide.
A spokesman at Golden Rule Insurance Company of Indianapolis, the leading underwriter of high-deductible medical insurance policies, said that its customers alone had opened 19,000 medical savings accounts this year.
The company is a big financial supporter of Republican politicians. In the 1996 election campaign, Golden Rule, its executives and its employees donated more than $480,000 to the Republican Party and Republican candidates, according to the Committee for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan watchdog group.
No one knows yet the characteristics of those who are opening the accounts -- whether they are primarily wealthy professionals, as Democrats suspect, or mostly people with modest incomes who are looking for a way to cut their insurance costs, as Republicans believe.
That will be studied, a Treasury Department official said, after 1997 income tax returns are filed in April.
One of the main Congressional advocates of medical savings accounts, Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said in an interview that he was encouraged by the pilot project.
"As is customary with any new product, the start was relatively slow," Mr. Archer said, "but demand is increasing as the sellers and the individuals covered learned more about it."
But Representative Pete Stark of California, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means panel's health subcommittee, said he expected the pilot project to be the death knell for medical savings accounts.
"It's a whacky idea," Mr. Stark said, "and they will be sold only to people who are bamboozled by slick insurance salesmen."

HEADLINE: Dime Says Bond Sale Will Reduce Earnings

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Dime Bancorp said yesterday that it would sell $1.4 billion in mortgage-backed bonds, resulting in a fourth-quarter after-tax loss of $15 million, as it moves to dispose of low-yielding investments.
The sale will reduce fourth-quarter per-share earnings by about 1 cent, a company spokesman said. 
 Proceeds from the sale will be used to pay down debt. Dime, the New York-based parent of Dime Savings Bank, also said it would repurchase three million, or 2.5 percent, of its common shares over an unspecified period.
These actions will "help us in our efforts to improve the quality of our earnings and our interest rate profile," Lawrence Toal, Dime's chief executive, said in a statement.
The $1.4 billion of bonds are part of $3.6 billion in securities Dime made available for sale. The company had no immediate plans for the remaining $2.4 billion worth of securities.
The security sales will reduce shareholder equity by about $31 million, according to Dime, one of the country's largest thrifts with $19.4 billion in assets.

Treasury Prices End Day Higher; Stock Loss and Asia Crisis Cited

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended slightly higher yesterday, lifted in part by a late tumble in the stock market.
Also helping bond prices were growing expectations that falling demand from Asia will slow United States economic growth. 
 "Bond investors are anticipating a slowdown," said Denny Niedringhaus, who manages $300 million of fixed-income assets at Southwest Bank of St. Louis in Clayton, Mo.
And Treasury prices continue to get a boost from international investors buying United States assets to escape shaky overseas markets, particularly in Asia.
In South Korea yesterday, stocks, bonds and the currency all plunged to record lows when the Standard & Poor's Corporation joined Moody's Investors Service in cutting the country's credit rating to below investment grade. A late drop in the Dow Jones industrial average drove some investors into the relative safety of the Treasury market.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond edged up 1/32, to 103 19/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, slipped to 5.87 percent, from 5.88 percent on Monday. In the second part of its monthly note auction, the Treasury sold the five-year notes at a yield of 5.685 percent yesterday, below the 5.694 percent yield expected. Demand was above the average of the last 10 monthly 5-year note auctions -- with more than $2,600 bid for every $1,000 of securities sold.
Some traders said the better-than-expected result was a sign of investors' confidence in current yields. "It makes me a little more optimistic on the market," said Rick Schwarz, head of government bond trading at Zions First National Bank Capital Markets in Salt Lake City.
Following are the results of the auction of new five-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Price . . . 99.742
High Yield . . . 5.685%

HEADLINE: A Master's Degree in Philanthropy Teaches the Business of Doing Good

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS

 BODY:
Dwelling on matters of morals and conscience, the graduate students sat behind desks arranged in a square, perhaps so they could look one another in the eye as they parsed the Gospel of St. John.
The Bible study was not for ecclesiastical purposes, as the professor put it, but to "foster explorations of our own lives." 
 The students are learning to be professional do-gooders. If they stick with it, they will have the parchment to prove it: master's degrees in philanthropy. It is one of the fastest growing fields in academia, and more than 75 American graduate schools now offer advanced degrees in philanthropy, nearly a fivefold increase since 1990.
Most philanthropy students plan to manage nonprofit organizations or help them raise money. Other students hope to sit on boards for various good causes -- the heart fund, for example, or the local symphony. Still others hope to become teachers in the field or scholars in the general science of do-goodism.
The national big daddy of do-good research is the Indianapolis campus of Indiana University-Purdue University, which has a Center on Philanthropy with 64 faculty members from 28 academic departments and two master's degree programs.
One master's candidate, Kathy Kraus, 28, said that friends sometimes looked puzzled when she told them about her graduate work.
"They'll say, 'You're getting a master's degree in what?' " Ms. Kraus said.
It is a reaction, no doubt, repeated by more than a few parents.
But Robert Payton, the head of the Center on Philanthropy, insists that the nonprofit economy accounts for 12 percent of the American work force and demands rigorous academic examination. Besides that, Mr. Payton said, somebody has to learn how to run these nonprofit organizations.
"This is a big deal," Mr. Payton, a former president of Hofstra University, added. "What makes this intellectual set of issues less worthy of critique than politics or business?"
His ambition is to make philanthropy centers "examine the social and moral health of society."
In a study of the academic field of philanthropy, Naomi Wish, who directs the Center for Public Service at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, said that 80 percent to 85 percent of students taking such graduate courses already had jobs with nonprofit groups and many were taking courses so they could move up in the field. Although the driving force may be ambition, pay is not, Ms. Wish said, noting that jobs in the nonprofit sector generally paid two-thirds of the salaries of comparable jobs in private business.
A vast majority of philanthropic courses are designed for practical marketplace applications: how to write grants, manage a nonprofit organization and draw up a set of ethical guidelines for a board.
Ms. Wish said that these programs had helped make universities more aware of the real-life problems around them.
"Universities have long been ivory towers," she said, "and these centers have pushed them to examine the quality of life" outside the classroom walls.
Most academic philanthropic centers in the United States are financed by foundations like the Kellogg and Eli Lilly Foundations and the Pew Charitable Trusts. Some academics have raised questions about the independence of doing scholarly research on the very foundations that pay for the work. Ms. Wish's own study was financed by a Kellogg grant.
But Ellen Condliffe Lageman, an educational historian at New York University who recently completed a study of the Indiana program that was financed by Eli Lilly, said scholars of philanthropy had little choice.
"Who else is going to support it?" Ms. Lageman asked. "We're living in an age where government funding is drying up for all kinds of things."
As a formal academic study, a philanthropy program at Yale University in the 1970's was a pioneer. The Indiana program, established in 1987, was a relative latecomer.
Kathryn Stallings, a graduate of the University of Virginia, where she majored in French and anthropology, said she wanted to earn a master's in philanthropy here at Indiana before she went to medical school.
"This will help me look at the practice of medicine very differently than I might otherwise," said Ms. Stallings, a Boston native whose parents founded and operate a program to help emotionally troubled children.
"For example, what is the appropriate level of medical care that we should expect in this country?" Ms. Stallings asked. "How do we decide when to intervene in other people's lives? What is the effect on society? These are questions that people in philanthropic studies are trained to ask."
The Philanthropic Studies Library here, named in memory of Mr. Payton's sons, who died at ages 18 and 31, is stocked with books intended to promote good, from "Saving the Earth" to a biography of Florence Nightingale.
At the law school, where pictures of Dan and Marilyn Quayle, class of '74, hang in the lobby, students gathered for a class called Legal Aspects of Philanthropy, where a lecturer warned about the direction of the road paved with good intentions.
Speaking about fiduciary responsibilities and the prudent-investor rule, the lecturer, Dave Bahlmann, who is also the president of Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., noted that people on charitable boards could be sued individually.
"It's not only about doing good," Mr. Bahlmann said as the overhead projector whirred. "You must also do well."

HEADLINE: For Brilliant Brothers, Joining Mathematics Faculty Is a Quantum Leap

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
In a cluttered apartment on the West Side of Manhattan about 10 years ago, Gregory V. and David V. Chudnovsky used a homemade supercomputer to calculate pi to hundreds of millions of decimal places, an effort to make sense of the basic mathematical ratio that most school children know as 3.14. By two billion or so decimal places -- a world record at the time -- they had found no discernible pattern, so they turned their attention to other problems in number theory, mathematical physics and computers.
But another long and daunting quest by the two mathematicians has yielded better results. Two decades after leaving the Soviet Union, the Chudnovskys -- authors of scores of papers and books, theoreticians, tinkerers, freelance thinkers and devoted partners -- have finally landed faculty positions at an American university. 
 Thanks to a small group of business executives and philanthropists who banded together to raise money for them, they have joined the faculty at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, where a supercomputer center has been established for them and they have been teaching a course on the mathematics of computer graphics.
The road from boyhood brilliance in Kiev to the faculty of a small commuter college in Brooklyn seemed at times as unpredictable as the endless digits of pi. There was the help from Andrei D. Sakharov in leaving the Soviet Union; a MacArthur Foundation grant for Gregory in 1981; years of effort and obscurity in Gregory's apartment crammed with stacks of papers and mail-order computer parts; a mix of pity and puzzlement from fellow mathematicians; a long profile in The New Yorker that brought some notice, but still no permanent jobs.
Fellow mathematicians have difficulty explaining exactly what kept the Chudnovskys from being snapped up by a top university after they arrived in the United States 20 years ago. They are widely respected by their peers, with assessments of their work ranging from solid to brilliant. In 1986, Herbert Robbins, a Columbia mathematician, wrote the National Academy of Sciences calling the Chudnovskys' difficulties "a personal and scientific tragedy."
Some have questioned whether their range of interests -- from applied physics and computers to more theoretical topics like number theory -- made them hard to place in an academic world geared to specialization. Others saw it more as a matter of personal chemistry. In any case, there was no question that the brothers were a tough pair to accommodate. Gregory has myasthenia gravis, a debilitating neuromuscular disease that keeps him in bed most of the time, making it difficult for him to carry a regular teaching load.
Moreover, the brothers were unwilling to leave New York, and insisted on being hired together. Not only does David help his brother in and out of his wheelchair and tend the computer when it breaks down, but the brothers have also been close professional collaborators since their teen-age years, anticipating each other's thoughts, completing each other's sentences, writing joint research papers.
Usually Gregory is presented as the genius. He solved Hilbert's 10th Problem (which had stumped mathematicians for more than half a century) at the age of 17, and later won the MacArthur grant. But the brothers simply say they work in close partnership.
Although each is married and they live in different boroughs -- David is in Manhattan, and Gregory has moved to Queens -- they are rarely far apart during the day. Gregory, 44, is slight and rumpled, his silver hair and beard bristling out from his thin face, his body sunk deeply into a wheelchair. David, 50, is more substantial, dressed in a white button-down shirt and tweed jacket, his gray hair closely clipped.
When the brothers arrived in the United States, they were given unpaid research titles, medical benefits and a housing subsidy from Columbia University, where they brought in millions of dollars in research grants. But their goal of becoming regular members of a university faculty with regular students proved elusive. Instead, they worked largely alone in the West Side apartment where Gregory then lived, supported by grants, consulting jobs and their wives' earnings (David's wife, Nicole Lannegrace, is a political affairs officer at the United Nations; Gregory's wife, Christine Pardo Chudnovsky, is a lawyer). They built a supercomputer from mail-order parts and pursued the patterns in pi and other projects, using a meat thermometer to make sure the machine did not overheat.
They might still be working there but for the 1992 New Yorker article about their search for pi, and the attention it drew from a few wealthy people. One was Jeffrey H. Lynford, a New York real estate executive, whose wife, Tondra, read the article aloud to him on an airplane trip to Los Angeles.
"My wife and I thought they were a resource wasting away," Mr. Lynford said. "We wondered how could we replant them, nourish them, and help them blossom."
He began to try to find faculty positions for the Chudnovskys and to raise money to endow chairs for them. He sought help from Richard Preston, who wrote the New Yorker article, and from others who had been drawn to the brothers by the article, including Mort Meyerson, chief executive of Perot Systems Corporation, and Walter F. Rosenberry 3d, a Denver philanthropist who typically supports human service organizations like women's shelters and said he had to take algebra twice to pass it.
"This is a visceral thing," Mr. Rosenberry said, adding that he liked the idea of being able to help "creative people in our overly organized society."
The brothers were surprised and moved that strangers had taken such an interest in them. "The story is how people have been willing to put in so much effort for us," Gregory said. "It's just amazing what they have done."
Despite the interest, no suitable prospects materialized until three years ago, when the chairman of the mathematics department at Polytechnic, Deane Yang, heard of the Chudnovskys' situation and called them.
The fit seemed perfect. Polytechnic was trying to build momentum. The brothers were prominent names. But there was still a hurdle: Polytechnic had little money, and its officials knew they needed to raise some before they could give the brothers endowed faculty slots. The university hoped Mr. Lynford could find it.
Mr. Lynford and some other backers put up money themselves. With Polytechnic's help, he lined up support from Borough President Howard Golden and from Brooklyn Union, which put up $100,000.
This summer they began moving boxes of computer parts to their new office in Brooklyn, and meeting with students. More than $2.5 million is now in hand, but Mr. Lynford and Polytechnic are aiming to double it. In the meantime, the brothers are writing new research proposals and teaching.
Landing the Chudnovskys is a coup for Polytechnic, as David C. Chang, its president, enthusiastically acknowledged at a dinner in their honor at the Rainbow Room this fall. "They're inspirational," he said. "They typify what our university should be. They go beyond pure science into things that help economic development. That may be less important to an Ivy League school or a comprehensive university, but for us, that is the challenge."
The Chudnovskys are equally enthusiastic. Polytechnic is not Princeton or M.I.T., but they are grateful for the positions, and comfortable with the gritty focus of the small 143-year-old commuter university, whose main campus is at Metrotech Center in Brooklyn.
"It's a university that wants to do something," Gregory explained. "The beauty of Poly is that it is a clearly defined school with a purpose."
The brothers are also taken with the students, many of them immigrants like themselves, who work full or part time and are seeking tools they will find useful on Wall Street and in industry.
"Most of the kids in Poly are working, so you not only get kids who know what they want to do, but they have a great attitude," Gregory said.
And so it was that on a Thursday evening this fall, they were conducting a computer graphics course on how to construct the mathematical models that allow the billions of bits of information representing images to be stored in powerful computers. The ideas were sophisticated, the approach down to earth.
"If you do it the stupid way, you will have to do it again," Gregory Chudnovsky warned the dozen students in the class, as David changed the slides in the overhead projector.
Gregory admits he is worn out by the teaching, but the brothers are happy. They have space. They have research support. They have students.
The students are happy, too.
Fatih Porikli, a Ph.D. student from Turkey who was drawn to the Chudnovskys' seminar by a modest flier on a bulletin board, said he had been astonished at the richness of the teaching, the brothers' ability to sketch the relations between computer vision and medieval art, bond markets and physics.
"I wasn't looking at my watch for the end of the lecture any more," he said. "These guys are the best teachers I have. I am lucky, right?"

HEADLINE: A Despised U.S. Envoy Stands Proud

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Dec. 20

 BODY:
After nearly five years, the United States Ambassador, Peter W. Galbraith, will leave Zagreb next month, reviled by the Croatian press, which once granted him celebrity status; under a cloud in Washington for his role in the clandestine delivery of Iranian weapons to the Bosnian Muslims, and ostracized in Government circles here as President Franjo Tudjman's most dogged critic.
In the course of his career, Mr. Galbraith, a political appointee with close ties to the Democratic Party, often chose to "make policy first and inform Washington later," in the words of a diplomat in his embassy. 
 Mr. Galbraith -- who is 45 with unruly black hair, the disheveled look of a high school English teacher and permanent half-moons under his eyes -- often speaks of his work in terms most diplomats would eschew.
"I decided from the time I came here that this was an opportunity to save lives," he said in an interview in his office, "and I would do the best I could for that goal."
Human rights officials, while praising the Ambassador for his recent calls for the return of exiled Serbs, condemn him for failing to denounce the mistreatment of the Serbs until most of them had been expelled. These critics argue that his close relationship with President Tudjman -- which earned him the nickname "the governor" -- along with his celebrity status, blinded him to the pernicious nature of Mr. Tudjman's nationalist Government until it was too late.
"He cared a lot more for Franjo Tudjman in the early days than he did for human rights," said Ivan Cicak, the head of the Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights.
Mr. Galbraith disagreed with this assessment, saying he was as vigorous in pursuing human rights early in his tenure as he was later.
The political landscape changed drastically on Aug. 8, 1995, when Croatian troops, having taken the Serbian-held Krajina region in a lightning assault, began driving a quarter-million Serbs out of the country. The Ambassador, with journalists in tow, hopped on a departing tractor carrying a Serbian family along a road lined with rock-throwing Croats and angrily denounced the expulsions.
He would spend the rest of his time in Croatia leading a quixotic campaign for the return of the approximately 500,000 ethnic Serbs driven from Croatia. His championing of the exiled Serbs deeply angered President Tudjman, whom he had once seen almost daily, and led to vicious attacks against him in the state-run press.
In 1996 President Tudjman, after returning from a trip to Washington, derisively referred to him in a speech as "the tractor diplomat."
The Ambassador calls the tag, now commonly used here, "the greatest compliment of my career."
"What I did not anticipate was that after the military action, the Croatian army and police would preside over the systematic looting of every house in the Krajina and the burning of maybe a third of them," he said, "or that the Croatian Government could so strongly resist the idea that people could return to their own country."
Even his harshest critics mark the tractor ride as a watershed.
"The policies of Franjo Tudjman finally became clear to him," Mr. Cicak said. "It was also clear that he, because of his support for Tudjman, was partly responsible for what happened to the Serbs."
With Croatian troops massing along the edge of the last Serbian-held enclave in Eastern Slavonia in late 1995, Mr. Galbraith and his staff worked feverishly to achieve an agreement for a peaceful transition. The agreement put the enclave under United Nations control until Jan. 15, 1998, in an effort to foster a gradual reintegration with Croatia.
Most ethnic Serbs in exile, however, have not been allowed to return to their homes in Croatia as the agreement stipulates. And Croats expelled by the Serbs six years ago have refused to go back to Eastern Slavonia until Zagreb takes control. It is unclear to many diplomats how tolerant the new Croatian authorities will be with the remaining Serbs or if the agreement will work.
Croatia is not the first place where Mr. Galbraith -- the son of John Kenneth Galbraith, the economist -- has courted controversy.
As a staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 1979 to 1993, he left northern Iraq in 1991 just ahead of Iraqi troops advancing to crush the Kurdish uprising. He visited the United States-backed rebels in Afghanistan and was instrumental in organizing Congressional pressure in 1984 to free the imprisoned Pakistani opposition leader, Benazir Bhutto, his former Harvard classmate.
The Ambassador, who will move to Washington and take a job as a senior official in the Agency for International Development, was instrumental in one of the most contentious Bosnia policy decisions made by the Clinton Administration.
Mr. Galbraith lobbied in April 1994 to allow Iran to transfer weapons through Croatia to the Muslims, who were outgunned by the Serbs and under siege in Sarajevo. President Clinton's agreement to look the other way as Iran and Croatia openly violated the United Nations arms embargo, however, was never relayed to the C.I.A. or the Pentagon.
"The President's decision not to object to the flow of weapons sustained the alliance between the Bosnians and the Croats, which at the time was in a very fragile condition," the Ambassador said, referring to the alliance brokered by Washington, which ended nearly a year of fighting between the Croats and Muslims. "If the Croatians had refused to permit the Bosnians to be armed, the alliance would have broken down. The arms shipments allowed the original victims of the aggression to, in a very short time, reverse the military situation on the ground. This paved the way for Dayton."
The planeloads of weapons, which began arriving in Zagreb and Pula, led the C.I.A. station chief in Zagreb, who thought the arms deliveries were a rogue operation, to report secretly on the Ambassador's activities and conversations.
Mr. Galbraith, who married a Norwegian anthropologist a year ago and has a baby daughter, was called last year to testify at Congressional hearings about the arms shipments. He is still being investigated by the House in connection with allegations that he made two secret trips to the Middle East to arrange for weapons for the Muslims, trips he insists never took place.
The secret arms program forged close links between Teheran and the Sarajevo government, as many in the C.I.A. had feared. These links, which include the presence of least 150 Iranian intelligence operatives now in Bosnia, have bedeviled Washington's efforts to build a multi-cultural, secular state, critics of the arms deal contend.

HEADLINE: Political Prisoner to President

 BODY:
In the days since his election, Kim Dae Jung has shown that he intends to govern South Korea in the same courageous spirit that marked his long, often painful effort to fight repression and one-party rule in his homeland. One of his first decisions was to endorse the pardon of two former Korean military rulers, including one who tried to have him killed. That gesture of reconciliation set the tone for the President-elect.
Mr. Kim's most important new initiative was to call for direct talks leading to an early summit meeting between the two Koreas. North Korea recently agreed to peace talks with the South in a format that also includes Washington and Beijing. The clear interest of both the United States and South Korea is to ease the tensions in North Korean society through diplomacy, humanitarian aid and economic cooperation. Washington should strongly encourage these new overtures to the North, which are still resisted by some of South Korea's conservative establishment. 
 Mr. Kim also faces an urgent challenge on the economy. He must restore plummeting international confidence without bringing on a needlessly severe contraction. He sensibly pledged to honor the loan agreement negotiated between the current Government and the International Monetary Fund. But that agreement, now in danger of being overwhelmed by new capital flight, would unreasonably squeeze the entire Korean economy to compensate for the financial recklessness of major banks and conglomerates. The fund should help Mr. Kim by loosening its unrealistic inflation targets.
Mr. Kim's most dramatic move, in human terms, was his agreement to the pardon of former Presidents Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo, after two years' imprisonment for military mutiny and amassing political slush funds. As President, Mr. Chun orchestrated the trumped-up conviction and death sentence imposed on Mr. Kim after a 1980 popular rebellion against military rule. Mr. Kim was spared execution only after strenuous American intervention.
Kim Dae Jung has the moral standing to make the pardon of Mr. Chun, and his close collaborator Mr. Roh, acceptable. But the new President should balance this act of forgiveness by repealing South Korean military rule's most damaging legacy, a National Security Law that permits harsh prison sentences for peaceful political dissent.

As Korean Crisis Worsens, U.S. Seeks to Limit Damage
South Korea is slipping steadily deeper into an economic morass despite an international effort to restore stability. As a result, the United States and other lenders are debating whether a second bailout of South Korea is needed even while acknowledging that such further loans may be politically impossible.
More signs of the deteriorating situation came yesterday and today. The World Bank released $3 billion to South Korea, while banks are negotiating with the Seoul Government in hopes that it would convert billions of private debt into debt owed by the nation itself. And Korean stocks continued to slide, falling more than 4 percent early today after tumbling 7.5 percent yesterday. Page A1. 

Stocks Tumble in Late Selloff
A late selloff pulled stocks down sharply. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 127.54 points, or 1.63 percent, with most of the loss coming in the last 30 minutes of trading. Banking and technology shares led the decline. While traders could not point to any specific cause, many said the steep drop highlighted investor concerns about corporate profits and a lack of stability in Asia. D6.
 
Treasury prices edged up, helped in part by the selloff in stocks. The yield on the benchmark Treasury bond slipped to 5.87 percent, from 5.88 percent. D6.
 
Strong Gain in Durable-Good Orders
Orders for durable goods jumped 4.8 percent in November -- the biggest gain in almost five years. But the surge in orders was concentrated in commercial aircraft and military hardware and was not seen as evidence of a pickup in economic growth. D3.

Orange County Settlement
Merrill Lynch agreed to pay $1.9 million and Credit Suisse First Boston agreed to pay $990,000 to settle a securities fraud class-action lawsuit filed by Orange County bondholders after the California county's 1994 bankruptcy. D7.
 
AT&T to Sell Unit for $625 Million
AT&T plans to sell its customer relations business to Cincinnati Bell for $625 million. Cincinnati Bell will fold the unit, AT&T Solutions Customer Care, into its own telephone services unit. D3.
 
An Uncertain World for Utilities
The promise of utility deregulation has proved frustrating to both utility companies and state regulators. Two events this week -- California's postponement of a start to degulation and the termination of a huge utility merger -- illustrate the current uncertain state of deregulation. Market Place. D6.
 
F.D.A. Approves Lung Product
The Food and Drug Administration approved an inhaled version of an antibiotic to help cystic fibrosis patients fight off deadly lung infections. The new product, Tobi, is manufactured by Pathogenesis. A14.

HEADLINE: Critics Say United Way Plan Can't Meet Goals for Children

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER and DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Since United Way of New York City announced an ambitious campaign last month to raise $50 million to help 250,000 disadvantaged children, an unusual amount of contention has developed about whether the charity can achieve its goals.
Critics say that $50 million cannot possibly provide services to as many children as United Way said it would. Moreover, the critics -- including several leaders of charities and children's advocacy groups -- contend that United Way and its co-sponsors in the effort, the Chase Manhattan Foundation and the New York Community Trust, failed to line up the backing they needed to turn their plans into reality. 
 "Nobody I know in child care had even heard about this" until the day it was announced, said Judy Ennis, special projects coordinator at Child Care Inc., "which makes me think that United Way, the Community Trust and Chase thought it up themselves." Her agency is one of the city's five major nonprofit child care referral agencies.
Questions about the plan have arisen since the president of United Way of New York City, Ralph Dickerson Jr., announced the campaign at a breakfast on Nov. 18. Gen. Colin L. Powell and more than 800 business and civic leaders attended the event, which was held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
Mr. Dickerson said the campaign, Caring Adults and Safe Places, would make New York a "world-class city for children" by mobilizing 100,000 volunteers and distributing the money -- to be raised over five years -- to nonprofit groups for after-school care, counseling, summer jobs or other services.
In two recent interviews, Mr. Dickerson acknowledged that the services would cost more than $50 million, and said that the program would require vast infusions of government money. But he said the significance of his speech was in the vision he set forth. "This isn't about money," Mr. Dickerson said. "This is about helping children."
But critics assert that the campaign, billed as a response to General Powell's highly publicized volunteerism summit in Philadelphia, appeared to be hastily conceived, poorly planned and based on unrealistic cost assumptions. Even if it meets its goal of raising $50 million, that amount could benefit only a fraction of the 250,000 children Mr. Dickerson said it would, they contend.
Some people also complained that the effort had failed to include some important community leaders, and they questioned the campaign's own leadership.
Mr. Dickerson and others involved in getting the campaign started conceded that many details were still being worked out. Joyce Bove, vice president of the New York Community Trust, one of the campaign's three co-sponsors, acknowledged that the group had been divided over whether to announce a specific fund-raising target. "We had different advisers who said if we said that we need to raise $500 million, which might be a more realistic number, it would sound so unapproachable that no one would listen," she said.
With the ambitious goals of the campaign and the fanfare surrounding it, the stakes are high for the United Way of New York City. Like many other United Way organizations, it has suffered a significant erosion in donations since the revelations in 1992 that William Aramony, the president of United Way of America, had stolen charity funds. National fund raising for United Way has yet to recover, and total contributions for United Way of New York City, adjusted for inflation, have fallen more than 17 percent since 1991, according to the group's own figures.
But some charity officials not involved in the campaign say that in its haste to capitalize on the publicity General Powell's visit to New York for the breakfast could generate, the task force organizing the United Way effort failed to adequately address basic issues about the plan.
The task force had not yet drafted a tentative budget or a fund-raising plan, or requested advance commitments from major donors, a standard step for most charities before announcing major fund-raising initiatives.
And several officials pointed to the enormous cost of the vast web of services outlined by Mr. Dickerson. One executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, estimated that the cost could be 10 times the stated figure of $50 million; another pointed out that the Pittsburgh United Way has set a $60 million goal for a five-year program that at its peak year will help just 7,600 children.
Still others have questioned the campaign's leadership, saying it was unclear how much backing the effort has from the Chase Manhattan Foundation. The foundation has repeatedly declined to comment on any aspect of the campaign.
Mr. Dickerson and his aides say that for their campaign to succeed, it needs generous support from major Jewish philanthropies, because of their prominence in New York. But Mr. Dickerson acknowledges that he did not call a single Jewish philanthropic leader before he made his speech.
Officials of the New York Federation-United Jewish Appeal, the city's largest Jewish philanthropy, noted that they could not attend the original Philadelphia summit because it was held during Passover. "From the get-go, you've made it difficult for the Jewish community to get behind this," said Stephen D. Solender, the Appeal's executive vice president.
Mr. Dickerson said last week that he had since had several conversations with Mr. Solender and that the United Way would be reaching out to other Jewish organizations. He also said the campaign was backed by more than 300 New York groups representing "top-level faith, community, corporate, philanthropic and youth leaders."
While competition for charitable contributions is intense in New York, it is highly unusual for leaders of nonprofit groups to criticize or raise questions about another organization's efforts.
Michael Clark, president of the nonprofit Citizens Committee for New York City and head of the task force overseeing planning for the United Way campaign, strongly defended the effort. The group included a broad range of people, he said, and spent "many, many hours" preparing an 18-page "strategic plan" laying out "our best effort at this point to cost out the services we hope to provide."
Mr. Clark conceded that the plan was "a work in progress," but asked, "When was the last time anyone sought to mobilize this contentious city around a common set of goals?"
Several managers of nonprofit organizations said they had warned United Way that the campaign's cost estimates and other assumptions were unrealistic. But they said they were ignored or overruled.
Seana Anderson, executive director of One to One, the Mentoring Partnership of New York City, pointed out that the plan to provide mentoring services for 50,000 children would by itself consume a significant chunk of the entire projected budget for the campaign. United Way said mentoring would cost $250 per child, a figure Ms. Anderson said was reasonable. That comes to $12.5 million over five years, or a fourth of the announced costs.
But mentoring is one of the less expensive of the broad range of services promised by Mr. Dickerson, who is the highest paid United Way executive in the country, with salary and benefits worth about $375,000 a year. In his speech, he proposed after-school care for 6,000 children, which at market rates would cost at least $18 million a year -- but which Mr. Dickerson said could be provided for less than $4 million by relying on volunteers.
Mr. Clark explained that the task force derived its cost estimates by averaging the cost of the most intensive to the least intensive programs it surveyed. But both he and Mr. Dickerson said they hoped the campaign would ultimately raise more than its $50 million target, especially since they are counting on a substantial contribution from government.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani agreed just before the breakfast last month to serve as honorary chairman for the campaign, but he did not offer any city funds for the effort and was not asked to do so.
Spokesmen for some New York nonprofit groups that the United Way said were involved in General Powell's volunteerism effort said they knew almost nothing about the local campaign.
Edward Phelan, president of the Highbridge Community Life Center, which provides social services to about 10,000 New Yorkers in the Bronx, is listed as a task force member and sent a delegate to General Powell's Philadelphia summit. But his group had not been involved since then. Ruth Avrin, the local Jewish Federation's executive director for leadership development who is also listed on the task force, said that she could not attend the one breakfast she had been invited to because it fell on Saturday, the Jewish sabbath.

Pro-Government Gunmen Kill 45 Indian Refugees
A band of pro-Government gunmen charged into a mountain hamlet in Mexico, spraying rifle fire and swinging machetes, killing 45 Indian refugees, Red Cross officials said. It was the bloodiest violence in the southern state of Chiapas since Indian rebels launched an uprising there nearly four years ago. A1

The international terrorist who calls himself Carlos was convicted in Paris and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of two French police agents and a Lebanese informant in a shooting 22 years ago. A1
 
Push for Chinese Labor Unions
A loose-knit group of veteran democracy advocates has started a campaign to promote independent labor unions among China's workers. The advocates, some in China and some in exile, hope to use Beijing's recent signing of a United Nations covenant insuring the right of workers to organize as a wedge against a Government that has suppressed all efforts to form unions outside its grip.

Netanyahu Tours West Bank
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led members of his Cabinet on a helicopter tour of the West Bank, apparently to dramatize their commitment to Israeli security while they wrestle with American demands for a "credible" withdrawal. A5
 
Russians Free Accused Spy
An American technician who was arrested in Rostov, Russia, nearly a month ago as a spy was given permission to go home for the holidays, according to an executive of his company. Richard L. Bliss, an employee of Qualcomm, a telecommunications company based in San Diego hired to install a state-of-the-art telephone system in Rostov, was temporarily released on the assurance that he would return in January to resume cooperating in the investigation.

Ebola Outbreak Fear in Kenya
The World Health Organization and local medical officials are dispatching a team of doctors to northeastern Kenya to investigate an outbreak of a mysterious disease with symptoms similar to those of the deadly Ebola fever. Government officials in the Garissa region say they have received unconfirmed reports that at least 143 people have died from an unknown disease this month in flooded villages throughout the region on the border with Somalia.

Former Nazi Leaves Hospital
The former Nazi officer Erich Priebke, who is serving a sentence for taking part in Italy's worst World War II massacre, was taken from Rome's military hospital and moved to a friend's home, his lawyer said, after a court ruled he could serve the remaining three months of his sentence under house arrest. The former SS officer was found guilty in July of participating in the 1944 mass execution of 335 men and boys in Rome in retaliation for an attack on German occupying forces. (Reuters)

Terry Nichols Found Guilty Of Conspiracy in Bombing
Terry L. Nichols was convicted of conspiring to bomb the Oklahoma City Federal Building, but in a nuanced verdict, a Federal District Court jury in Denver acquitted him of actually committing what was the worst terrorist act on United States soil. He was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter but was acquitted of the far more serious charge of murder. Still, the conviction on the conspiracy count could bring Mr. Nichols the death penalty and the jury will convene again on Monday to begin deciding his fate. A1
 
In finding Mr. Nichols guilty of conspiracy and involuntary manslaughter but not first or second degree murder, jurors essentially decided that he acted recklessly and in a manner that he should have known could cause death, but that killing was not clearly his intention, legal experts said. A12
 
Rape Case to Be Retried
An Alabama prosecutor said he planned to retry two brothers who spent nearly 14 years in prison before being freed this month after DNA tests indicated that they were wrongfully convicted of rape in 1984. A10
 
Fat Linked to Fewer Strokes
A long-term study has found that men who eat more fat, including more saturated fat, are less likely than men on lower-fat diets to suffer a stroke. The finding, which is supported by two earlier studies in Japan and Hawaii as well as by experiments in laboratory rats, is the
latest in a series of conflicting

The Food and Drug Administration approved an inhaled antibiotic to help cystic fibrosis patients fight off deadly lung infections. A14
 
Haitian Refugees Win Reprieve
President Clinton delayed the deportation of up to 40,000 Haitians who fled to the United States while an abusive military junta ruled their island nation. Mr. Clinton also promised to work with Congress to provide the Haitians long-term legislative relief of the kind provided earlier this year to Central Americans who also fled civil strife. A11
 
Use of Medical Accounts Grow
Medical savings accounts -- seen by Republicans as a sensible way to cut health insurance costs and by Democrats as a tax break for the healthy and the wealthy -- have been tested in the private market for a year with few participants.

Gap in Bridge to Be Sealed
Engineers will seal a gap next to the pedestrian walkway on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco after a 2-year-old girl plunged to her death in a freak accident on Sunday, officials said. The girl, Gauri Govil of Fremont, Calif., was pronounced dead after slipping slipped through a 9 1/2-inch gap near the northern end of the bridge and fell about 170 feet to the ground below.

WITH KOREA CRISIS WORSE, U.S. SEEKS WAY TO LIMIT HARM

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
Faced with devastating evidence that a two-month-long attempt to restore stability to South Korea's economy is failing, the Clinton Administration is scrambling for other options to contain the country's financial damage.
In a sign of the increasing desperation surrounding the South Korean problems, the World Bank released $3 billion to Seoul today, saying that although the money was originally intended to reshape the nation's banking system, it could be used immediately to help pay short-term loan obligations. 
 At the same time, commercial banks owed billions by South Korean companies and banks are negotiating with the Seoul Government in hopes that it would convert that private debt into debt owed by the nation itself.
Such a change would create the basis for repayment negotiations similar to those used to save Brazil and Argentina in the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980's. But it is far from clear that such talks would succeed. And a day after two big credit-rating agencies, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, lowered South Korean debt to junk bond status and sent its financial markets plunging, officials in Washington conceded that they faced no easy choices.
"The whole idea now is to buy a little time -- maybe two or three months -- until the new South Korean Government is in place," said a participant in three-way talks between the Governments in Seoul and Washington and South Korea's lenders on three continents.
They do not have the luxury of time, judging from the descent of the Korean stock market, which fell a record 7.5 percent today, and with the currency, the won, worth about half its value a few months ago.
 In Seoul on Wednesday, stocks closed down a further 4.07 percent, but the value of the currency rose to a spot rate of 1,852 to the dollar, compared with 1,962 late Tuesday.
Investors' anxieties have not been eased by the next South Korean leader, President-elect Kim Dae Jung, who proclaimed in Seoul today that he was stunned by the severity of the crisis and that "we don't know if we will go bankrupt tomorrow or the day after tomorrow."
For all practical purposes, the United States and other lenders to South Korea are debating a second bailout because it has become clear that the first effort, a $57 billion financial aid package announced 19 days ago by the International Monetary Fund, is inadequate.
The hope had been that the declaration of such an enormous amount of loan aid would persuade private investors that their money was safe and that they could continue to lend South Korea the cash it needed to avoid defaulting.
The opposite has happened, however. The Korean financial situation has soured so quickly in the last two weeks that the country's credit rating has fallen precipitously. The junk bond status now assigned to Korean debt has made it far harder and more expensive for the country to obtain loans at the moment it needs them most.
At the same time, the major trading nations, including the United States and Japan, say it is politically impossible for them to lend South Korea the tens of billions of dollars required to piece the world's 11th-largest economy together again. The Clinton Administration has said it will not do in Asia what it did in Mexico -- take the lead with a bailout plan that puts American taxpayer dollars at risk.
So far, the United States has committed $5 billion to the Korean rescue effort but said it would only make the money available after South Korea had exhausted loans from the I.M.F. and others. There is growing pressure on Washington to release that money in the next few weeks, a step that Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who is on vacation this week, declined to take two weeks ago when South Korea first requested it. This week, American officials hinted they may be reconsidering.
 But a senior American diplomat in Seoul said on Wednesday that the United States thought Korea could make it into January and that it did not plan to release the $5 billion before then.
President-elect Kim, a former dissident who won a narrow victory over the ruling-party candidate last Thursday, has said he will abide by the terms of the I.M.F. agreement, and he dropped his campaign promise to prevent job layoffs, which would have undermined the painful I.M.F. steps that will close money-losing banks and businesses.
But his inexperience in an economic crisis was evident today, when his "go bankrupt" remark helped aggravate the slide in South Korean markets. Mr. Kim may have been speaking for dramatic effect, as his aides insisted after they watched the markets' reaction. In volatile financial situations, investors do not use the word "bankrupt" lightly, and with rumors swirling that South Korea's short-term debts might be far greater than believed, his words were taken seriously.
"Somebody is going to have to teach the President-elect how to talk to the markets," a senior American official said today. "He doesn't quite have the language down yet."
 In Seoul early on Wednesday, Mr. Kim said he believed that the crisis was "surmountable," apparently trying to tone down the alarm his earlier statement aroused.
Mr. Kim's remarks today may have simply accelerated a flight from the the South Korean currency that was already well under way. It is a measure of the failure of the "stabilization plan" that the won is now 38 percent cheaper against the dollar than when the I.M.F. bailout was announced on Dec. 3.
Markets have been rattled by the apparent inability of the Korean Government to determine exactly how much companies owe in short-term debts -- those due in the next year. The figure is said to exceed $100 billion, far higher than Seoul initially estimated, and may be greater still. One official said that the Federal Reserve and the I.M.F. had sent representatives to Seoul "to get a handle on those numbers."
The strategy now is to get South Korea through the next several weeks with a combination of money from the I.M.F., the World Bank, bridge loans from the Japanese Government and agreements from private banks to renegotiate their loans as they come due. But many lenders, particularly Japanese banks, are not permitted to hold junk bond debt.
The $3 billion released to South Korea by the World Bank today was the first installment in a planned $10 billion program. The World Bank has been negotiating a deal with Seoul intended to improve the country's banking system; break some of the chummy ties between the Government, the big conglomerates and the banks, and bolster social welfare programs to insure that the country can help workers who lose their jobs.
But World Bank officials acknowledged at a news conference here that the most pressing use for the money would be to help deal with the looming debt-repayment crisis. Restoring financial stability, they said, is a condition for attacking the underlying problems in the banking system.
"We make no bones about the fact that we're contributing to market confidence and that there is a stabilization aspect to this loan," said Mark Malloch Brown, the World Bank's head of external affairs.
 To address the underlying problems, the senior diplomat said, David A. Lipton, the United States Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, and the I.M.F. have been negotiating moves -- like relaxing interest rates and controls on foreign exchange transactions -- to further open markets and attract foreign capital.
Bank officials said they were also willing to go to great lengths to help South Korea -- the $3 billion was wired to Seoul almost instantly on approval by the bank's board today -- because they do not want the crisis to erase the remarkable economic gains made by the Koreans over the last three decades or to threaten other Asian economies.
"We're not prepared to see that success story go down the tubes," Mr. Malloch Brown said.
Commercial bankers in the United States say they are discussing restructuring South Korea's debt, using the Latin American crisis as a model. But the talks hinge in part on whether the Seoul Government will guarantee repayment of all debts, public and private. Those debts would then be sold as one large package to international investors.
 South Korean news reports said Wednesday that Citicorp was in talks with Seoul about leading a consortium to lend $3 billion. Citicorp declined to comment, but United States bankers called the reports false.
Asked about any debt-rescheduling negotiations with commercial banks, Danny Leipziger, the World Bank's team leader for South Korea, replied, "We've heard those discussions are going on."
It is unclear whether repackaged debt would receive additional guarantees from foreign governments like the United States, as occurred in Latin America.
Unlike the Latin debt crisis, the Asian troubles involve lenders worldwide, with European and Japanese banks facing much larger potential losses than American banks.

HEADLINE: Street Musician's Fee Is Ruled Excessive

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER 

 BODY:
Calling music a form of expression protected by the First Amendment, a Federal district judge in Manhattan has ruled that the New York City Police Department violated the free-speech rights of a street musician by charging excessive permit fees.
The ruling was praised by some of the city's ubiquitous street musicians, who have been hampered by the city's crackdown on quality of life complaints as they compete for scarce handouts. 
 In the ruling, which was issued on Friday and made public on Monday, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin said that the $45 fee charged for a one-day permit to play amplified music on the streets far exceeded the Police Department's cost of processing the permit, and constituted an unreasonable curb on free speech. However, she did not say what a reasonable fee would be.
The street musician, Robert Turley, who plays a "treble bass," an unusual 10-string electronic bass guitar, said by telephone that he was pleased with the judge's ruling.
"It will make it more affordable to be heard," he said, shortly before heading out to play at one of his regular locations, the northwest corner of 47th Street and Broadway.
Mr. Turley's lawyer, Robert T. Perry, said that the ruling applied not only to street musicians, but also to preachers and others who seek to amplify their music or voices electronically.
The city's Acting Corporation Counsel, Jeffrey D. Friedlander, said he believed that Judge Scheindlin's decision was "wrong on the law," and that "taken as a whole, these fees bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of processing the applications."
He said his office had advised the Police Department to stop charging the permit fee until the city decides whether to appeal the ruling.
Mr. Friedlander defended the formula by which the Police Department arrived at the fee, which took into account the salaries of personnel involved in handling the applications and other costs.
Street musicians across the city applauded the judge's ruling, saying the economics of public performance, with or without an amplifier, simply could not support hefty fees -- or the even heftier tickets issued by the police.
Julio Cesar Diaz, who dances salsa with a rag doll named Lupita, has been fined three times in the last two months for using an amplifier without a license in the Times Square subway station. The tickets cost $50 -- a sum he considers an excessive penalty on his livelihood.
"I've never held out the hat," he said yesterday. "I owe everything to this doll -- my rent, food for the children and everything."
The judge's ruling came in a lawsuit in which Mr. Turley had also asserted that the police harassed him when he tried to perform on street corners and traffic islands, usually around Times Square.
"I would sooner lose my powers of speech than to not be able to play in front of people," Mr. Turley told a jury last May. The city denied the accusation at trial, saying the police were properly enforcing rules on street noise, a major complaint from the public.
The jury awarded Mr. Turley $37,000, but after Judge Scheindlin ordered a new trial on the issue of damages, the city agreed to settle with the musician for $150,000, his lawyer, Mr. Perry, said.
Some performers, like Carlos Mesa, an acoustic-guitar player who serenaded commuters in Grand Central Terminal with a medley of contemporary jazz, were unaware of the fees in the first place. "I've never asked for a permit, the police never asked me to pay, and I wouldn't want to pay," Mr. Mesa, 39, said yesterday. "Why should I pay? Look what I made all day!"
He pointed to the open guitar case on the ground before him. In four hours, he had made roughly $8 in loose change.

HEADLINE: Three Hospitals Plan Units for Children

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
Montefiore Medical Center announced this week that it had raised a quarter of the $100 million it needs to build a new children's hospital in the Bronx, in what would be the third new major medical complex for children planned in a region that has few pediatric hospitals.
Unlike other large cities in the United States, New York has largely incorporated its pediatric services into huge medical institutions, which are a prime engine of the local economy. Now, Montefiore and Westchester County Medical Center have plans for separate and expensive children's hospitals at a time of little construction in the medical industry. 
 Babies Hospital at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center is also planning a $70 million building to replace its aging children's hospital at Broadway and 168th Street in Manhattan.
Health care experts say there is no single reason for the three projects, but rather intersecting trends: To a large extent, experts say, hospitals are trying to find a niche for themselves, as managed care has increased competition for patients. Also, experts say, expanded state and Federal programs for uninsured children have helped guarantee a steady flow of money to care for children.
Moreover, several hospital officials said the New York area could accommodate more separate pediatric hospitals, given the size of the population and the success of similar complexes in Boston and Philadelphia.
"A couple of us have been pushing it hard," said Dr. Steven P. Shelov, chairman of pediatrics at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, which is planning a $10 million upgrade of its pediatric unit. "It has taken a combination of a clear recognition that children's services have not been what they are in other parts of the country with the fact that children, when they get to hospitals, have more complex needs." Until recently, Dr. Shelov had been at Montefiore helping to plan its children's hospital.
The plans are all similar in that they will provide health care specifically for children and will permit families to become more involved in their care. There will be more play areas, beds for parents to stay overnight and rooms oriented toward the hustle and bustle of the hospital, which officials said would make children feel safe.
"It will go way beyond just making the families comfortable and family-friendly," said Dr. Irwin Redlener, who is the director of community pediatrics at Montefiore and who is in charge of construction of the hospital. "Parents should be active partners with the medical team in organizing and following up the health care of their children."
Montefiore's plans, the most expensive of the three, have largely been kept under wraps in recent months as hospital officials solicited the first major donations. Most of the seed money came from two members of the hospital's board, Lionel L. Pinkus, chief executive of the financial services firm E. M. Warburg & Company, and Martin S. Davis, who was raised in the Bronx and who is chief executive of Wellspring Associates, a private investment company. Each donated $10 million. In addition, $1 million was given anonymously, and the Children's Health Fund, a nonprofit children's health program founded by Dr. Redlener and the singer Paul Simon in 1987, donated $4 million.
The Montefiore Children's Hospital, which is expected to be completed in 2002, will be on the hospital's main campus on Bainbridge Avenue in the Bronx. Dr. Redlener said the new hospital, with about 100 beds, would be the hub in a larger health care system for children in the Bronx. Montefiore already has 35 clinics in the borough whose operations would be integrated into the children's hospital, with more routine cases being treated at the clinics and more severe cases at the hospital.
He said he expected that the hospital would also draw patients from around the region.
At Columbia-Presbyterian, officials have already received approval from the State Department of Health for a pediatrics building at Broadway and 165th Street, a site that is now a parking lot. The 120-bed Babies Hospital, along with Schneider Children's Hospital-Long Island Jewish Medical Center, is one of the few separate children's hospitals in the region.
Dr. William T. Speck, a pediatrician and top hospital official there, said the need for an up-to-date children's center had become evident during the recent merger between Columbia-Presbyterian and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He said the center would serve pediatric cases referred through the new hospital system's dozen hospitals around the city. He said he expected construction to be completed by 2000.
In Westchester, the Westchester County Medical Center, soon to become a quasi-private, nonprofit institution, is planning a 110-bed children's hospital on the main campus in Valhalla, said Bruce K. Komiske, executive director of the Children's Hospital Foundation, who oversaw the building of the Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence, R.I.
Officials at all three hospitals stress that only a few new beds will be added in the new construction, which they characterized more as a consolidation of existing beds for children under better conditions. So, the officials said, they doubted that there would be much competition among them for patients, although Montefiore and Westchester may draw from the same area in southern Westchester, and Montefiore and Babies may face some competition in the Bronx because of hospitals affiliated with Babies in that borough.
John Billings, director of the Health Research Program at the Robert F. Wagner School for Public Service at New York University, said he thought that children's hospitals could face more serious competition in the suburbs of New Jersey and southern Connecticut. Overall, Mr. Billings said, he felt there were more pressing medical needs in the region for the huge amounts of money being spent on these three projects, like renovating Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, and he labeled the new hospitals basically marketing efforts to keep competitive.
He said, however, that he thought there were enough sick children to keep them all in business.
"Do we need children's hospitals?" Mr. Billings said. "Probably not. Will it be better patient care? Probably."

U.N. Rejects U.S. Plea For a Decrease in Dues

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 23

 BODY:
The United States has succeeded in keeping the United Nations budget at the rate Congress had demanded but failed to get its dues lowered.
In negotiations that ended with General Assembly resolutions late on Monday, the United States, which owes more than $1.3 billion to the United Nations, received a commitment that the dues issues would be revisited next year, providing that it paid its debt. 
 European diplomats said today that Washington would never get its dues lowered to 20 percent of the United Nations budget, as Congress once visualized, and would be lucky if they were reduced from the current 25 percent cap to 22 percent.
The chief United States delegate to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, conceded that because of the huge debt, "American interests have been compromised." He added that, "Clearly it has cost us credibility."
The three-year assessments adopted by the assembly show no rise for China as Mr. Richardson had wanted. China, a permanent member of the Security Council, will pay less than 1 percent of the budget for the foreseeable future. And dues for Russia, another permanent member, will be reduced.
Those carrying the largest burden are Japan and the 15 European Community members. Japan's contribution will rise from 17.9 percent in 1998 to 20.5 percent in 2000, bringing it close to the United States despite its much smaller economy. Germany is third, with 9.6 percent.

Unemployment Rate Drops in New York

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate fell in November below 9 percent for the first time in more than a year, to 8.7 percent, caused by a surge in seasonal hiring and a decrease in the number of people searching for jobs, the New York State Department of Labor said yesterday.
The city's seasonally adjusted jobless rate was 9.1 percent in October. It reached a peak of 10 percent in June and has fallen, in fits and starts since then, though November's was one of the biggest monthly drops. The statewide rate, also adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, fell to 6.2 percent, from 6.4 percent in October, the state said. 
 The Labor Department said that employers in the city added about 3,000 new jobs during November, a bit off the average pace for the first 10 months of the year.
A reduction in the numbers of people estimated to be actively searching for jobs was also a major contributing factor, said Jeffrey Weissenstein, a labor market analyst for the state. Mr. Weissenstein said that above and beyond the longer-term business cycles of job creation, unemployment in New York typically falls toward the end of the year, then rises again in January as short-term seasonal jobs end.

BYLINE: By Phil Patton 

 BODY:
FEW phrases can more quickly strike terror into the heart of the average American parent, hunkered down under the Christmas tree, than this: "Some assembly required." Worse, as is the case with Compaq computers, the Bose Wave radio, most furniture from Ikea and many toys, if the instructions bear few words or none, only pictures.
Once, I gloried in object assembly. Stranded at home with the measles in the second grade, I put together a dozen airplane models, learning detail and sequence from the complex instructions. In my half-literate state, I relied mostly on the pictures. 
 Today, it seems, more and more instructions have been reduced to pictures alone. Wordless instructions are found on camera and telephone paperwork, as well as airline safety cards, chopstick wrappers, orange juice containers and Heimlich maneuver posters at restaurants. "It's a global economy," investors and designers alike chant; visual instructions circle the globe and avoid the perplexities of different languages.
The Boy Scout handbook has long avoided text when dealing with things like tying knots. Icons on dashboards or cameras -- the snowflake for heat, the mountain for long focus -- are simple instructions, as is the arrow for "play" on tape machines.
More and more, the words have shrunk to a precious few, in six or seven increasingly less familiar languages. Children seem happier with visual instructions than do adults, who may feel they are watching a film with no soundtrack. Ikea has found that Americans seem more verbal than its European customers and therefore are less comfortable with visual instructions. (Europeans long ago got used to international road signs and other hieroglyphics.)
The more intimidating the device, the more intense the effort to make assembly simple through images. Computer manufacturers now brag about what they refer to as the "out of the box experience." Apple, Compaq, Acer and Packard Bell print their instructions as a mostly wordless poster, replacing such designations as "serial port" with pictures of coded connectors. Krzystof Lenk and Paul Kahn, information consultants in Providence, R.I., created a life-size map for assembling the I.B.M. Thinkpad: pieces of the computer fit onto it precisely.
Richard Saul Wurman, the author of "Follow the Yellow Brick Road: Learning to Give, Take and Use Instructions" (Bantam, 1972), emphasizes the need to tailor instructions to the audience -- and to the use. He cited Harold R. Booher's research with military personnel that concluded that pictures were good for speed, words for accuracy. The best instructions seem to include a diagrammatic inventory of parts and numbers to indicate the assembly sequence. But, as Mr. Wurman noted in an interview last week, "there are no hard-and-fast rules."
"You have to figure out what is appropriate," he said. "It is inappropriate on an airplane to have to read a safety card if the plane is crashing."
There is evidence that men (generally considered right-brainers who prefer pictures) and women (left-brainers who prefer words) respond to different sorts of instructions, and the drift toward wordless instruction sheets may well result from the idea that this is men's work.
Ikea's furniture is all shipped flat, and it is up to the buyer to assemble the chairs, tables and lamps at home. Ikea's instructions say, "Follow me," and then picture the parts: a fastener, for instance, and the notation "x 12" if a dozen of them are needed. Details of fasteners are shown at larger scale, leaping out from the diagram in little circles.
Several years ago, my daughter, then 8, put together an Ikea bookcase, unintimidated by the absence of words. But many adults are scared off by Ikea's diagrams. Groucho Marx, confronted with some task touted as "so simple any 8-year-old can do it," is said to have replied, "Quick, run out and find me an 8-year-old."
If designers want to make instructions simple enough for an 8-year-old to use, perhaps the real target should be someone a little older.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Up Against the Yen, But Eases vs. Mark and Pound

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar edged higher against the Japanese yen yesterday as the announcement of accelerated aid to South Korea failed to instill much confidence in Asian economies.
The Christmas holiday today and early market closings in the United States yesterday kept foreign-exchange activity to a minimum, and traders said the dollar's movements were generally uneventful. "Liquidity is so thin that you couldn't do anything if you wanted to, and if anybody is going to react to news they'll probably wait to do it over the next few days," said Tom Hoge, vice president for corporate trading at the Bank of New York. 
 In New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 129.85 yen, up from 129.22 on Tuesday. It slipped to 1.7735 German marks from 1.7755 marks. And the dollar eased against the British pound, which rose to $1.6703 from $1.6656.
Traders said the dollar was static after the International Monetary Fund said it would speed up $2 billion of its promised $57 billion package for South Korea, sending the money by the end of the year. Donor nations pledged a further $8 billion in January. The Korean currency, the won, rose for the first time in five days.
And the Japanese Finance Ministry said it would postpone penalties against banks whose capital-to-asset ratios did not meet minimum standards. The Government, which had planned to impose sanctions against such banks by April 1, is concerned that a decline in bank lending will lead to more business failures.
The yen was also put on the defensive yesterday after the Standard & Poor's Corporation lowered its credit ratings on Sanwa Bank Ltd. and Sakura Bank Ltd..
The dollar's strength was limited, though, by continuing speculation that the Japanese central bank would intervene in the currency markets, selling dollars for yen, as it did in large amounts last week.
In other trading, the Canadian dollar strengthened after the Bank of Canada extended a series of interventions on behalf of its currency. The Canadian dollar rose to 69.7 United States cents, from 69.58 cents on Tuesday. But many analysts expect Canada's currency to resume weakening toward an all-time low of 69.13 United States cents, which was recorded in February 1986.

HEADLINE: Malnutrition's 20-Cent Treatment

 BODY:
Four years ago, scientists putting together studies from around the world realized that giving children with vitamin A deficiency a 2-cent capsule two or three times a year cut their death rate from diarrhea and other infectious diseases by a quarter. Today, 60 percent of the world's children get vitamin A. At a cost of about 20 cents or less to deliver each capsule, this is one of the most cost-effective methods of preventing disease ever found. The vitamin A project is one of several nutrition programs detailed in this year's report on the State of the World's Children from Unicef. Every year, says Unicef, nearly 12 million children under 5 die, more than half because of malnutrition. Fortunately, many proven, cheap ways to prevent malnutrition are in use, and Unicef's report gives them needed attention.
Malnutrition is growing only in sub-Saharan Africa, due largely to the debt crisis and its accompanying poverty. But wealth is not the only cure. In Latin America the poverty rate has changed little since 1970, but malnutrition has dropped by two-thirds, mainly because of better access to health care and a gain in the status of women. In South Asia half of all children are malnourished, largely because women are overworked, underfed and undereducated. 
 Unicef argues that fighting malnutrition is an investment, as the disease, disability and low I.Q. caused by malnutrition reduce some nations' economies by 5 percent. A small investment here can yield a large return. More than 100 million young children have diets that lack vitamin A, crucial for preventing blindness and strengthening the immune system. In combination with zinc supplements, vitamin A also helps children resist malaria. Mothers can benefit as well. Giving pregnant women one low-dose vitamin A or beta carotene capsule a week (high doses can damage the fetus) cuts the maternal mortality rate by nearly half. Numerous studies suggest that taking vitamin A during pregnancy can also reduce the rate of H.I.V. transmission from mother to child. Supplements of iron, zinc and folate also protect mothers and children.
In addition to supplements, health officials are trying to fortify common foods with nutrients and diversify diets to include more nutrients. Switzerland and the United States have put iodine in salt since the 1920's to prevent mental retardation, but this was not done on a widespread basis until the 1990's. Now nearly 60 percent of the world's edible salt is iodized, much of it paid for by the Kiwanis International Club, which is planning to raise $75 million to end iodine deficiency.
The United States Congress, which has been supportive of child health, allocates $25 million a year to the purchase and delivery of micronutrients. It could usefully spend more. Fifteen years ago, many scoffed when Unicef began a campaign to vaccinate the world's children. But today, most governments conduct mass immunizations, which reach 80 percent of children and save three million lives a year. Micronutrients are cheaper, require no refrigeration and can piggyback on existing vaccination programs. They should be able to save even more children from an early death.

HEADLINE: Income Rose In November, U.S. Reports 0.8%

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Personal income rose eight-tenths of 1 percent during November, the biggest gain since June 1996 and double the size of the month's increase in consumer spending, the Commerce Department said today.
"There's not much inflation out there," said Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. "With all the sales we're seeing, there's no rush to buy because the price might be better tomorrow than it is today." 
 Because consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic output, trends in income and consumption can be an indication of future business activity and provide clues about the Federal Reserve's inflation stance.
The November report is also a gauge of consumer spending at the beginning of the holiday shopping season. Earlier this month, the Government reported that retail sales had increased two-tenths of 1 percent in November, less than expected.
November was the 13th consecutive month in which personal income increased. The gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent was larger than October's revised increase of six-tenths of 1 percent.
Spending, meanwhile, rose four-tenths of 1 percent in November after increasing half a percent in October. November was the 17th consecutive month in which spending increased.
However, income gains are likely to taper off in the months ahead, analysts said. "The economy is moderating, and it's likely to continue to slow, with the consumer sector losing momentum," said James Glassman, chief United States economist at Chase Securities Inc. in New York. That is likely to mean that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged in the first part of 1998, he said.
"The Fed's on hold for now, with a prospect for easing in the second half of the year if inflation stays low," Mr. Glassman said.
In the third quarter, consumer spending grew at a 5.6 percent annual rate, the strongest pace in five years. Analysts at Merrill Lynch & Company expect spending to slow to a rate of between 2.5 percent and 3 percent in the current quarter and in 1998.
In today's report, the Commerce Department also said that disposable income, the money left over after taxes, increased seven-tenths of 1 percent in November, faster than October's gain of half a percent. The savings rate rose to 4 percent, from 3.8 percent in October. Interest payments to businesses, which are counted separately from the spending figures, increased by six-tenths of 1 percent.
Separately, the Labor Department said the number of people applying for state unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week. First-time jobless claims declined by 13,000, to a seasonally adjusted 307,000. In the previous week, claims rose a revised 6,000.
The four-week average for jobless claims, a less volatile gauge of employment conditions than the weekly figures, rose to 315,750 in the latest week from 315,000 the previous week.

HEADLINE: Nasdaq Reports 2.1% Rise In Uncovered Short Sales

 BODY:
December has been a cruel month for technology stocks, and some investors appear to have bet that the news will get worse.
Open positions of short sales on the Nasdaq market, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, rose 2.1 percent, to a record 1.79 billion shares as of mid-December, the market said yesterday. Figures reflect trades reported through Dec. 10 and settled as of Dec. 15. 
 Uncovered short sales are essentially bets that stock prices will fall, and technology stocks were clearly the favorites of short-sellers in the last month.
The Quantum Corporation, whose stock plunged 25 percent earlier this month when it warned that falling prices for its hard drives would depress third-quarter earnings, showed the largest rise. Its short position climbed more than 8 million shares, to almost 19.9 million shares.
Several other technology companies, including Sun Microsystems, saw large increases as well. But the Intel Corporation saw its short position fall more than 5 million shares from mid-November, to 31.5 million.
Part of the reason may be that Intel, the world's largest maker of integrated circuits, has said that it does not expect to be severely affected by the problems in Asia's economies. Intel's shares, which plunged earlier this month, have been recovering. It still holds the second-largest short interest position on Nasdaq, though.
While high short-interest positions have been considered an indicator of bearish sentiment, they can also result from complex trading strategies involving options, futures and other stock-related derivatives.

Treasury Securities Fall in Price

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell in a shortened session yesterday, the first decline in bonds in five sessions.
Bonds were pressured after South Korea said it was able to pay its immediate debts and will get $10 billion in international aid sooner than expected, damping demand for the safety of United States assets. 
 "The news that the bailouts are being lined up means maybe we're getting to the end of the immediate crisis" in Asian financial markets, said Livingston Douglas, who helps manage $1.3 billion at Kiewit Investment Management Corporation in Omaha. "It may be that the flight-to- quality trade is coming to an end," he said.
The news from South Korea is "hurting U.S. bonds by alleviating a little of the stress in Asia," said Andrew Brenner, head of global fixed-income trading at Fimat USA Inc.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 19/32, to 103. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.91 percent, from 5.87 percent on Tuesday. The Treasury market ended early yesterday and will be closed today for Christmas. The market will also have a shortened session tomorrow.
Bond prices barely budged after the Government said the number of workers filing for unemployment benefits last week fell to 307,000, lower than the 316,000 analysts had expected.
Other economic data released yesterday also had little impact. The Commerce Department said personal income rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in November, while spending rose four-tenths of 1 percent.
Some investors said that they did not expect bonds to move much until the market gets more information on the economy's health and the effectiveness of the aid to Asia.
"It looks like we are kind of frozen here for a while," said Robert Alley, who manages $2.5 billion at the Houston-based AIM Advisors.

 BODY:

Korean Aid Is Accelerated As U.S. Changes Strategy
The United States joined other leading industrial nations in supplying South Korea with $10 billion in emergency aid. The move is an about-face for the Clinton Administration. Two weeks ago, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, left, rejected a request by South Korea to speed up aid. Now, the United States will lend $1.7 billion by the second week of January.
In return for this latest cash infusion, Seoul has agreed to further open its markets. Six large United States banks, meanwhile, have agreed to come up with a plan to help South Korea, prodded along by the Administration and the Federal Reserve. A1. 

The dollar ended slightly higher against the yen, as the announcement of accelerated aid to South Korea failed to inspire much confidence in Asia's economies. D5.
 
Nasdaq Price-Fixing Settlement
Thirty brokerage firms, including some of the biggest names on Wall Street, agreed to pay about $900 million to end a class-action lawsuit that accused the firms of scheming with each other for years to fix prices on the Nasdaq stock market. The settlement would be one of Wall Street's biggest, in terms of money and the number of brokerage firms involved. A1.
 
Big Gain in Incomes Last Month
Personal income rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in November, double the increase in consumer spending for the month, the Commerce Department said in a report that reinforced expectations of continued low inflation. D2.
 
Japan Delays Bank Sanctions
The Japanese Finance Ministry postponed for a year the imposition of penalties on banks that do not meet its standard of financial soundness. The sanctions would have taken effect on April 1, but the Government was concerned that a decline in bank lending would lead to more business failures. D3.

Modest Declines in Stocks
Stocks fell in an abbreviated trading session. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.64 points, or four-tenths of 1 percent. Merck and Disney led the decline in the Dow. D6.
Treasury prices weakened for the first time in five sessions. The 30-year Treasury yield rose to 5.91 percent from 5.87 percent. D13.
 
Health Groups Join Fight on Patent
Health care organizations have pledged support to Kaiser Permanente, which has filed a suit seeking to invalidate a patent used to demand millions in royalties from providers of a common prenatal test for birth defects. D2.
 
BellSouth Application Rejected
BellSouth's application to enter the long-distance telephone business in South Carolina was rejected, as expected, by the Federal Communications Commission. The Justice Department had recommended that BellSouth's application be blocked. D2.
 
Platinum Surges on Russia Cutback
Platinum and palladium futures prices surged on word that Russia had halted shipments in a dispute with Japanese customers. D5.
 
Tourism Slumps in Egypt
The massacre that claimed the lives of 58 tourists in a 2,500-year-old temple in Luxor last month is having a profound impact on the Egyptian economy. The sharp falloff in the number of tourists since the attack may shrink the economy's rate of growth by as much as one-third, according to one estimate. Tourism has been the country's most important source of foreign exchange. D3.

Spying for Profit
The first commercial spy satellite, built by Earthwatch of Colorado, was launched from Russia. The company said customers would pay $300 to $725 an image. A16.
 
Markets Closed
All financial markets and banks in the United States will be closed today for Christmas. Most overseas markets will also be closed. Many financial markets in the United States will have abbreviated trading sessions tomorrow and will resume normal hours on Monday.

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Wide Range of Fees for Checking Accounts

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
When Citibank last month raised by 200 percent the minimum balance it requires for free checking, it sparked criticism from New York City officials and state legislators.
State Senator Nellie Santiago, a Democrat of Brooklyn, denounced the bank as interested only in doing business with the wealthy. The city's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, Jose Maldonado, promptly issued a survey that found that some bank customers pay more than $200 a year for basic checking services. He called the survey's findings "quite disturbing." 
 Unknown to many, though, there are several lesser-known banks that offer free checking, with no minimum balance required, and sometimes even free withdrawals from automated teller machines -- a package that to deal-hungry New Yorkers, long accustomed to being nickel-and-dimed by everyone in town, seems as rare as a vacant rent-controlled apartment.
"You have to shop around," Mr. Maldonado said. "Consumers don't have to be held captive by the exorbitant fees that some banks charge."
At Citibank, depositors must maintain a balance of $6,000 in all accounts, including loans, to avoid a monthly fee of $9.50, up from its previous requirement of $2,000 in checking accounts alone or $6,000 in all accounts excluding loans.
"What really bothers me," said Senator Santiago, the ranking Democrat on the State Senate Banks Committee, "is not so much the 200 percent increase in minimum balance requirements, but the message it sends that Citibank only really wants to do business with wealthy people and corporations."
Responding to the survey, a Citibank spokeswoman, Susan Weeks, said, "We offer a range of services and products, and these services are expensive."
Other banks that had the highest fees, according to the survey by the Consumer Affairs Department, were Bank Leumi USA, which requires a minimum balance of $5,000 to avoid a $15 monthly fee and a 50-cent charge on each check or each withdrawal from an A.T.M., and Chase Manhattan Bank which requires balances of $3,000 to $4,500 to avoid a monthly fee of $9.50 and a 50-cent charge on checks and A.T.M. withdrawals.
The least expensive banks were Independence Savings Bank and Fourth Federal Savings Bank, which both offer free checking with no minimums and with no-fee A.T.M. cards.
"I was so amazed when I met with an account representative and I asked if there was any fees or any minimum, and they said, 'No,' " said Cat Jackson, a resident of Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, who opened a checking account at Independence Savings. "I thought for sure they would squeeze me somewhere."
Terence J. Mitchell, an executive vice president at Independence Savings Bank, said the bank could afford to offer free checking because it had a lower level of risk in its loan portfolio than other lenders. "We run a tight ship," he said.
Banks analysts said free checking, a phenomenon that died in the early 80's but appears to be making a small comeback at neighborhood banks, is often a marketing strategy many smaller banks employ to compete with the bigger banks.
Dimitri Papadimitriou, the executive director of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., said that at smaller banks, the primary customers for loans are low-to-moderate income people who are particularly price sensitive and are attracted to perquisites like free checking accounts.
But small banks are also not the most convenient. Independence, for example, has 38 branches, but only one in Manhattan, at 34th Street and Lexington Avenue. Chase Manhattan was ranked first in the Consumer Affairs department's "most convenient" category, with 278 branches and 1,200 A.T.M.'s in the city. Bank Leumi, the city's most expensive bank, was also its least convenient, with only two city locations.
"We decided several years ago to leave the retail market and gradually sold most of our branch network," said Ilene Moskowitz, first vice president and director of strategic marketing and planning at the bank. She said that was the reason for the bank's high minimums, as well. "Bank Leumi USA serves specialized segments, middle-market companies and internationally oriented businesses," she said.

Falling Bodies

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Thinking about the economic crisis in Southeast Asia reminds me of that joke about being on the 30th floor of a hotel, looking out your window and suddenly seeing a man falling past your room. "How you doing?" you ask him as he sails by. "Fine," he says. "So far." And so it is with the Asian economies. This crisis has just begun. Korea and its neighbors are still far from having hit bottom. Their crises are still confined largely to stock markets and currencies. But soon bankruptcies will mount, real estate prices will plummet and the real economy, real jobs and real people will hit the pavement. Even then the story won't be over. Because what's happening in Southeast Asia today is also a China crisis, an education crisis and a political crisis.
The China Crisis: A Thai businessman summed it up for me in one sentence: "China can make everything we do now -- only cheaper." China's low wage structure doesn't really threaten America because China doesn't make the high-end products America specializes in. But China helped trigger this latest crisis by using its cheap wages and cheap currency to undersell its neighbors. 
 Tom Banker runs Gemessence, a gem-cutting business in Bangkok. "The Chinese are now doing the cutting the Thais used to do," he told me. "Because the Thai currency was pegged to the dollar, my labor costs tripled from 1987 to 1997 without a tripling in productivity. I was trying to keep 220 Thai employees busy, but as labor costs kept going up, I couldn't justify cutting cheap stones here. My average worker here gets $200 a month. In China it's $50 a month. So I cut my staff here to 68 people, who only do the most sophisticated work. The rest I moved to China."
The Education Crisis: If Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are to keep ahead of China, they must move up the knowledge ladder, so they can produce more sophisticated products and leave the low end for China. The problem is that Thailand has compulsory education only up to sixth grade. Worse, the education systems in Southeast Asia do not encourage innovation, creativity or independence of thought. They can mimic Bill Gates, they can consume Bill Gates, but they can't create Bill Gates. Or to paraphrase a recent analysis in The Economist magazine: In Japan and Southeast Asia the nail that stands up gets hammered. In America that same nail is driving a Ferrari in Silicon Valley.
Norani Othman, a Malaysian Muslim intellectual told me in Kuala Lumpur last week: "There is a jingle that runs after the news here that celebrates Information Technology -- IT. It says: 'Love IT; learn IT; IT is the only way to our future.' But it's just a mantra. The Government is not educating a generation that can indigenize real information technology, authenticate it and reproduce it themselves. Students learn by rote, like a bunch of robots."
The Political Crisis: Chanokphat Phitakwanokoon, a 40-year-old Thai-Chinese woman, sells cigarettes and Bao Chinese dumplings at a sidewalk stall off Bangkok's Wireless Road. How's business? I asked the other day. Down 30 percent, she said. I asked if she knew what a stock market was. "Yes," she answered without hesitation. "I own shares in Bangkok Bank and Asia Bank. My relatives were all buying, so I bought too. They are not worth much now." This is a dumpling seller with a fifth-grade education and no shoes on -- but she owns stocks. Yes, this crisis reaches very deep.
Will people like Chanokphat Phitakwanokoon lead a backlash against leaders who tell them the only way out of this crisis is more bitter I.M.F. medicine and more globalization? Hard to know. If this were the Middle East, demonstrators would have already burned down I.M.F. offices. But people here tend to be more pragmatic. The initial reaction is to cut back, save more, work harder. But for how long? The falling bodies still haven't hit the pavement.
This next six months is the most critical political moment for Southeast Asia since decolonization. If the liberal democrats now taking over in Korea and Thailand can turn things around quickly, great. But they're going to have to break some powerful forces -- the crony capitalists, politicians and bankers who benefited from the old system. If the pain of reform cuts too deeply and too widely, you could get a merger (as happened in Iran against the Shah) between the crony capitalists and the urban underclass against the liberal democrats. That's the danger.

HEADLINE: Call for Environmental Study Delays Plan for a Florida Airport

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 24

 BODY:
In a new setback for the city of Homestead, one of the areas hardest hit by Hurricane Andrew five years ago, the Federal Government has ordered the city to postpone building an airport on the site of a closed Air Force base until an environmental study can determine whether the project would damage the Everglades and protected coastal areas.
The study, which is expected to begin next month, will be conducted by the Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration. 
 The city's plan would use the existing Air Force runway and build a terminal, hangars, warehouses and cargo areas.
Officials in Miami-Dade County, where Homestead is located, estimate that the airport will cost $20 million. Politicians have lobbied since 1992 for the construction of an airport to lift the town's economy.
Three years ago, the Air Force conducted an environmental impact study, but after planners revised the original proposal, it decided to commission a new review.
The proposed changes included an increase in the number of cargo flights and the possibility of adding a runway.
"After five years of studies, negotiations and environmental cleanup, there has been no gain for South Dade," where Homestead lies, Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade County said. "This decision represents another severe blow to the economic recovery of this community."
Officials have argued that they should be allowed to begin building the airport while the study is in progress.
For environmental groups, however, the Government's decision, which was announced on Tuesday, signaled a small victory in a protracted battle involving politicians, Federal agencies and wildlife advocates.
The environmental groups have long argued that a new airport and its accompanying noise could threaten the health and reproductive ability of wildlife in the Everglades National Park, which lies 12 miles west of the 1,300-acre airport site, and the coastal Biscayne National Park, two miles to the east.
The decision by the White House to postpone construction for the study "was a victory for our national park system," said Alan Farago, the political conservation chairman of the Sierra Club in Miami, adding that it was "time to take a big step back from this massive airport."
Still, Mr. Farago said, the new environmental impact study does not assure the sanctity of both parks. County officials have drafted tentative plans for a second runway and other expansion by about 2015 that, officials estimate, could cost as much as $2.2 billion, he noted.
If the second phase is completed, Homestead, a city of about 28,000 people, could turn into a bustling, international thoroughfare.
"This is no small airport," Mr. Farago said. "They are trying to hide an elephant with a mouse."
The controversy has also pitted some members of the Cuban-American community in South Florida against critics who contend that large donors of the Democratic Party are serving as a powerful force to sway Washington to their side.
Before 1992, Homestead Air Force Base contributed an estimated $400 million to the local economy. After Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida in August 1992, the base was closed and 11,000 jobs were lost.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Hidden in the Glitter of a Bountiful Economy, Problems Remain

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Joblessness is lower than it has been for a quarter-century. Inflation is less than 3 percent and appears to be falling. Corporate earnings have been powering a sustained boom in the stock market that has added trillions of dollars to the wealth of the middle class.
But before succumbing entirely to the warm and fuzzy spirit of the holidays, it is worth noting that all is not perfect in the New Economy. Indeed, there is no compelling reason to believe the problems that stirred predictions of doom and gloom a decade ago are any closer to solution. 
 PRODUCTIVITY -- Yes, microprocessors are ubiquitous, revolutionizing everything from inventory control to movie animation. Yes, the globalization of trade and investment has left America's service industries at the top of the heap. Yes, Wall Street leads the world in financing invention and spreading risk.
But all that gee-whiz technology and organizational change has yet to make a dent in the measured growth in output per hour of work. Productivity growth in the sustained boom of the 1990's has averaged a bit more than 1 percent, about the same as the sluggish 1970's and 1980's and less than half the pace of the 1950's and 1960's.
Perhaps the measurements are light-years off -- perhaps the bean counters haven't captured the full value of surfing the net, repairing wayward genes or eating farm-grown salmon. But similar arguments could have been made about direct-dial long-distance calls in the 1950's, jet travel in the 1960's or heart bypass surgery in the 1970's.
Truth is, economists don't have a clue to why productivity is apparently in the doldrums, or whether the winds of progress will soon freshen. Yet in the long run, nothing is more important to economic well-being.
INFLATION VS. EMPLOYMENT -- In the 1980's economists were convinced that 6 percent unemployment was "natural" in the sense that a lower rate would lead to competition for workers that yielded unsustainable wage gains. Today, unemployment is 4.6 percent and the worry-of-the-month is deflation. Surely that's progress.
Maybe. For one thing, evidence from the past suggests that wage pressures build slowly. For another, world commodity prices have been falling sharply and the dollar has strengthened against other major currencies -- anti-inflationary benefits that cannot last and may well reverse.
Even if the trade-off between inflation and employment has permanently improved, the widely offered explanation is hardly reassuring. America workers, the reasoning goes, were so traumatized by downsizing, outsourcing and the globalization of production over the last decade that they are afraid to ask for raises.
SAVINGS -- Like productivity, private savings are difficult to measure. And, as with productivity, the anecdotal evidence of recovery from lean times in the 1980's has yet to be matched by the hard numbers.
There has been progress on a related front. The Government has pulled up its socks, transforming budget deficits that subtracted two to three percentage points from the national savings rate in the 1980's into projected surpluses. But those socks may well slip again. Indeed, unless Washington cuts deeply into the cost of Medicare, deficits that would embarrass even Ronald Reagan are virtually guaranteed.
Private savings in aggregate are, of course, the sum of individual savings. Thus if Americans were prepared to let retired baby boomers subsist on Spaghettios, the savings issue could be ignored. But most of those future retirees are somebody's parents. And the fact that they are currently squirreling away just half of what they need to sustain their current living standard will soon be everyone's problem.
INCOME INEQUALITY -- Between 1974 and 1994, families in the upper 5 percent of the distribution enjoyed an average annual gain in income of 1.2 percent. But those in the bottom fifth saw their incomes shrink.
The change is not quite as depressing at it appears. The cost of living has probably not risen as fast as the Consumer Price Index, implying that the real incomes of all groups has probably gone up. Moreover, America's real (if somewhat oversold) social mobility does allow the most tenacious to move up the ladder.
But those who wonder how anyone can raise a couple of kids on the after-tax proceeds from an $8-an-hour job will have a hard time finding the silver lining. Most of the evidence suggests that the lion's share of gains from productivity is going to those with talent. And even if training were readily available to all, tens of millions of Americans would still be condemned to work for less than a living wage.
Is this the best of possible economies? Certainly it is looking good compared with stagnant Europe and crisis-ridden Japan.
Face it, though: Dr. Pangloss is a poor excuse for Santa Claus.

HEADLINE: Pangs of Poverty at a Joyous Time

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
He woke up at 3:45 in the morning on Christmas Eve, threw on jeans, a parka and construction boots and trudged across the 135th Street Bridge from Harlem to the Bronx because he did not have $1.50 for the bus. His nickname is Popeye, and that's the only name he would give because he did not want everyone to know how bad Christmas would be.
His last construction job ended seven months ago, and he said he was hoping to get on with a construction company in the Bronx so that his 8-year-old son, the youngest of his six children, would find a Nintendo 64 video game waiting for him today. "I didn't get it," he said, as he lined up yesterday afternoon with dozens of Harlem residents for a free meal. 
 They came with little money, big appetites and the drawn faces of desperation to the Salvation Army's Harlem Temple at Lenox Avenue and 137th Street, where free turkey dinners were being served. "I feel bad when my kids ask for something and I can't give it to them," Popeye said. "And I don't want to make false promises I can't produce. That's the worst feeling in the world."
In the more privileged precincts of the city, there were signposts of a more jubilant holiday season. On the Upper West Side, the lines were a half-block long outside Zabar's and Citarella.
At the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, on Amsterdam Avenue and 112th Street, the story of Christmas was told in scriptural readings and carols, accompanied by organ music and choristers. "This is an oasis of tranquillity," said Kurt Slamer-Calbera, 38, of Brooklyn. "I come here every Christmas."
At the Central Presbyterian Church, at Park Avenue and 64th Street, New Yorkers took cats, dogs, turtles, parrots and ferrets to the annual blessing of the animals.
Andrea Stagoff's 8-year-old wire terrier, Kimberly, and 5-year-old bichon frise, Teter, sat quietly on her lap. "I think this is a wonderful outpouring of love for the animals," Ms. Stagoff said. "It shows just how much people bond with their pets. They personify the holidays because of the joy they bring to us all year round."
But at the Salvation Army's Harlem outpost, there was a wealth of hard-luck stories.
Marshell Gibson, a homeless, 38-year-old grandmother of three, sat down for a meal of turkey, stuffing, corn bread, mashed potatoes, ham and mixed vegetables. She had just come from Christmas shopping at a discount store on Lenox Avenue. She showed off a black doll she bought for $1.99 for her 5--month-old granddaughter, Ant; a $2.99 police car for her grandson, Ravon; a $4.99 race car for her granddaughter, Unique, and a $3.99 trinket for her 39-year-old niece.
"I've been saving up for the gifts," she said, beaming. An unemployed home-care attendant, Ms. Gibson has been sleeping at a Harlem shelter since September, when her five-story walk-up building on 121st Street was condemned. "I'm homeless but not helpless," she said. "Every morning when I wake up, I praise God. I tell him what I want to accomplish, but first I praise him."
Ms. Gibson has been able to earn a little money running errands for shelter residents.
Her only child, Nadine, 21, lived on the second floor of her building. She, too, is homeless, pregnant again and staying in a midtown shelter with her children.
At the Harlem Salvation Army Center, Priscilla Singh, 36, and Steve Gilmore, 43, looked lovingly at each other between bites of turkey. The couple, who met eight months ago, plan to get married. They sleep where they can.
Ms. Singh, who is recently divorced, says she used to have a drug problem, but no longer does. Old friends are the only people who will take them both in. It is hard to find co-ed shelters, they say.
"We can't be separated," said Mr. Gilmore, a father of five who is separated from his wife of 14 years. "We're going to get married."
Two months ago, Mr. Gilmore was working as a medical assistant. He is looking for another job. So is Ms. Singh, whose only clothes are those on her back: a Hard Rock Cafe T-shirt, black ski pants, a dungaree jacket and a corduroy coat. Her last job was as a store clerk, but now she says she has health problems.
Still, they are thankful they have each other. Last Christmas, both say they were better off financially, but miserable emotionally. They were with their respective spouses, but were not as happy as they are now. "We're going to rough this period out," he said. "But we're believing in God for something better."

HEADLINE: Big Year Allows Port to Cut Fees and Challenge Rivals

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Sometimes good news begets more good news. Business in the Port of New York and New Jersey has been very, very good this year -- container traffic rose 13 percent through September compared with the same period in 1996. And that, in turn, has helped shippers in the port continue to tackle the high labor costs that for years hobbled the port's attempts to compete with others.
The New York Shipping Association, with the approval of the longshoremen's union, made a deep round of cuts last week in the shipping fees that pay for longshoremen's fringe benefits. The cuts, which take effect Jan. 1, could decrease the total cost of shipping a container through the port to inland cities by about $20, or more than 2 percent, an industry analyst said, without taking money out of the longshoremen's pockets. The cuts are expected to provide a powerful weapon in the port's effort to woo business away from other East Coast ports. Fees for containers -- which can hold anything from VCR's to toys to beer -- bound for local destinations will be cut even more. 
 "These are whopping cuts," said Randy Brown, a transportation economist at Paul F. Richardson Associates, a consulting firm based in Holmdel, N.J. "In this business, people die for two or three dollars. If you can come up with a $20 reduction in this industry, that's huge."
The cuts were made possible by three factors. One is that increased volume means fewer idle longshoremen, who, according to their contract, must be paid when they do not work from a kitty financed by the shipping fees. Now, with more work, that kitty can be reduced. Another is a simple economy of scale: more tons of goods mean that the fee per ton can be decreased. The last is that the total number of longshoremen, which has been dropping steadily since the advent of containerized shipping in the 1960's, when there were about 20,000, is continuing to decline -- there are now about 2,700. This has led to lower health care and pension costs, which are also paid out of the fringe benefits fund.
"For the first time in three decades, the supply and demand of labor are in equilibrium," said Ed Harrison, manager of port marketing and labor for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "For three decades, there was a snowball effect that drove cargo out of here," he said, referring to the cost of paying thousands of idle dockworkers. "The snowball is now going in reverse."
James A. McNamara, the spokesman for the International Longshoremen's Association, said the union had no problem with the cuts. "It's not a question of concessions by the union," he said. "It's that expenses are getting lower."
Combined with other moves expected to make the port more competitive -- progress on dredging channels to accommodate larger, modern ships, better rail connections, increases in longshoremen's productivity due to automation and the imminent breakup of Conrail's rail monopoly in and out of the Ports of Newark and Elizabeth -- port officials say the fee cuts should help continue the port's turnaround after decades of decline.
Already this year, the port's share of container cargo bound for the Midwest has increased to 17 percent among East Coast ports, from 12 percent, said Mr. Brown's boss, Paul F. Richardson. In all, the port moved more than 1.28 million container units, which are 20-foot truck containers or their equivalent, during the first nine months of 1997, up from 1.14 million units through the same period last year.
The fee cuts include a decrease in the assessment charged to containers being imported to or exported from American cities more than 260 miles from New York, to 50 cents a ton from $1 a ton; a reduction in the fee charged on cargo starting from or going to cities within 260 miles, to $2.50 a ton from $2.90 a ton; a drop in the assessment on cars to $2 per vehicle from $3; and a 63 percent cut in the charge for moving empty containers, to $15 per container from $40.
The shipping association, which represents 70 waterfront employers, has been chipping away at the fees for a decade. In 1987, the fee on shipments to inland cities, for which competition between ports is fierce, was $5.85 per ton. It has fallen 91 percent since then.
Mr. Brown said that with the current round of cuts, the port and overland cost for moving a 40-foot container bound for Europe from Kansas City onto a ship in New York Harbor has dropped to $1,016, from $1,033. The same shipment through one of its chief East Coast competitor, Norfolk, Va., would cost $1,030, Mr. Brown said. He added that the difference between the shipping costs from either East Coast port to Europe was negligible.
Conrad Everhard, the chairman of Cho Yang America, one of the biggest ocean carriers in New York Harbor and a major presence in Norfolk also, said the cuts would tempt him to move more containers through the company's dock in Bayonne, N.J. "This was a very smart move for the port," he said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
IN A SHIFT BY U.S., AID WILL BE SPED TO SOUTH KOREANS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24

 BODY:
In an about-face, the Clinton Administration joined other major industrial nations today in supplying South Korea with $10 billion in emergency aid and in asking major commercial banks to extend the deadlines by which Korean banks must repay their debts.
While American officials sought to cast the decision today as an acceleration of aid already committed to South Korea, it appeared to represent a failure of the Clinton Administration's original approach to the Asian financial crisis. 
 Two months ago, just before the Korean markets began to plunge, the Administration was privately warning officials in Seoul to get their house in order.
When a $57 billion bailout plan was announced under International Monetary Fund leadership on Dec. 3, Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin said that American taxpayer dollars would only be used as as part of a $5 billion "second line of defense" if South Korea exhausted funds provided by the I.M.F. and the World Bank.
Two weeks ago, Mr. Rubin summarily rejected a request by the South Korean Finance Minister to speed up aid, saying he thought that the step was unnecessary.
Today he did just that.
The United States has now agreed to lend $1.7 billion to Seoul by the second week of January, and such loans may yet prove necessary to stabilize the South Korean currency, the won, which has fallen 37 percent in value this month alone.
For its part, South Korea has agreed to further open its markets in return for this latest cash infusion.
"This decision is overwhelmingly in our economic and national security interest," Mr. Rubin told reporters today, justifying a decision that the Administration fears could renew debate in Congress over the use of American funds to bail out failing foreign economies and banks. "If you have economic instability, you run the risk of political and social instability." And South Korea, he said, is a country where "there are still enormous security concerns for the United States."
The new money for the Koreans will come from the Emergency Stabilization Fund, a currency reserve fund under the control of the President and the Treasury Secretary.
Created by the Administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930's to support the American dollar, the fund was tapped during the bailout of Mexico two and a half years ago, and disbursements do not require Congressional approval. But while Mexico agreed to put up the revenue it reaped from oil production as collateral for the $12 billion it borrowed -- all of which has since been repaid, with interest -- South Korea is offering nothing except its word.
There was no immediate reaction from Congressional leaders or from junior members who complained most bitterly about the Mexican bailout. Most of their offices were closed for the holidays.
American officials said they were not concerned about repayment, citing the "deep relationship" of the United States with South Korea, an allusion to the more than 35,000 American troops stationed there as a defense against the Communist leadership of North Korea. The unstated assumption is that Seoul would pay any debts to its critical military ally before it repaid other lenders.
"The uncertainty of getting paid back," Mr. Rubin said, "is very low."
For the Treasury Secretary, however, today's announcement is an admission that his strategy for containing the Asian economic crisis -- and keeping it from leaping to Japan and other big industrial nations -- has so far failed to work.
Cutting short a Christmas week bone-fishing expedition, he returned to a frenzy of meetings at the White House that have included Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen; President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger; the White House chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, and at times the President.
Yet Administration officials said they were unsure whether the bailout plan would persuade private investors and lenders to resume lending to the South Koreans.
"We always recognized there was some risk the stabilization plan wouldn't work," Mr. Rubin said today. "It was a good program that should have worked." But the flight of money out of South Korea and the relentless selloff of its currency continued unabated, he noted. The new plan, he said, "should work," though he acknowledged that "there are no guarantees."
Korean markets were mixed today, with stocks losing a little more than 4 percent but the currency improving to an exchange rate of 1,836 won to the dollar.
American and Japanese officials characterized the emergency aid as an effort to buy time. While South Korea has enough cash to repay debts due by the end of next week, it is likely that its banks would default in January. The rapid $10 billion infusion -- including $3.3 billion from Japan, $2 billion from the I.M.F. and contributions from a variety of European nations -- is something of a stopgap while American, Japanese and European banks negotiate a way to relieve South Korean banks -- and thus Korean industry -- of $30 to $40 billion in short-term debt.
That effort began even as Mr. Rubin was announcing his decision. Six major American banks met today at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and agreed to come up with a plan to help the Koreans, prodded along by the Administration and the Federal Reserve. The banking companies included J. P. Morgan, Bankers Trust, BankAmerica, the Bank of New York, Chase Manhattan and Citicorp. Of those, Citicorp has lent the most to South Korea, though American banks are far less exposed to the Korean crisis than banks in Japan and Europe.
"The idea here was to show some American leadership because the American banks are the healthiest," said a senior Administration official involved in the negotiations, which are beginning to resemble how the Latin American debt crisis was resolved in the 1980's. On Thursday, a similar meeting of Japanese banks is expected in Tokyo.
While the United States and Japan are casting the negotiations between South Korea and the private banks as voluntary, it is clear that this is part of the package Mr. Rubin has assembled with the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and their Japanese counterparts.
The fact that the meeting today took place at the New York Federal Reserve -- which handles most international transactions for the Fed -- seemed to emphasize that the whole package of government and private aid was being carefully orchestrated.
The choices for private bankers range from agreeing to extend their loans, to forgiving some portion of the debt and writing it off as a loss, to finding ways to raise new money for South Korea that could ultimately insure repayment of the old money.
Another possibility, officials said, is for the Seoul Government to guarantee some of the debt of the private banks. But that would run counter to an American objective to insure that the rescue plan forces weak banks and weak Korean companies to go bankrupt, purging the economy and forcing the losses on foreign and domestic investors who provided those banks with cash.
Indeed, today's action opens the Administration to criticism that in the the name of bailing out South Korea it is also bailing out investors -- including major American, Japanese and European banks that made bad investments.
Only a few months ago, Mr. Rubin was warning of the "moral hazard" created by such bailouts, because private investors around the world would come to expect that if huge investments in an emerging market like Korea went bad, the United States and the I.M.F. would ride to the rescue.
"Look, I wouldn't spend a nickel to bail out investors or creditors," Mr. Rubin insisted to reporters today. "The purpose of this is not to help creditors; the purpose is to help Korea."
But he acknowledged that it was virtually impossible to save the country from default without saving those who invested in it.
American officials said that the South Korean President-elect, Kim Dae Jung, a onetime dissident who last week became the first opposition leader to be elected to run the country, had agreed to a number of concessions in return for the fast help.
Korea had agreed to dropping a series of restrictions on imported goods and on foreign investment there, both issues that American trade negotiators have sweated over for years. For example, Seoul is to lift the restrictions on foreign acquisition of Korean companies, if the takeovers are friendly mergers. It has also lifted the ceilings on foreign investments in bonds issued by Korean companies.
Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, told reporters that Seoul had also agreed to stop providing cheap, dollar-denominated loans to banks to pay off their debts. A new, high interest rate on such loans puts pressure on the weakest banks to pay off their debts or close their doors. President-elect Kim has also agreed to allow Korean companies to lay off workers, ending one of the practices that has kept companies bloated.
That agreement could easily turn into a major political problem for Mr. Kim. South Korea's enormously strong labor unions have already promised street demonstrations to protest layoffs, and American officials are concerned that much of the anger will be directed at the United States.

New Convention Center Is Backed by Whitman

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Economically depressed Wildwood got a present from the state yesterday, when Governor Whitman signed a bill paving the way for construction of a new $58 million convention center. 
 The project will be financed through a 2 percent local tax on tourism, a $10 million low-interest loan from the State Economic Development Authority, and bonds to be sold by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. The 72,000-square-foot convention center will be operated by the sports authority, which also runs the new $318 million, 610,000-square-foot convention center in Atlantic City.
The two centers will be marketed together and are not expected to be in competition with each other because of the difference in size.

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH: Marvin Smith;
The Heartbeat of a Photogenic Life

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
THE narrow hallway of Marvin Smith's Harlem apartment is stacked with bubble-wrapped works of art: pictures by Romare Bearden, etchings by friends and an oil portrait of an art teacher Mr. Smith painted when he was just a sharecropper's son from Kentucky, newly arrived with his twin brother to see what New York City was all about.
"It was September of 1933, and when we got off that bus, we landed in Times Square," said Mr. Smith, 87, the living half of the duo of Morgan and Marvin Smith, photographers. "We looked and looked, and then we asked, 'Where are all the black people?' " 
 They were directed to Harlem.
They couldn't have come at a better time. The brothers, striking looking men in their 20's, were not only talented artists, but also identical twins. "The twinness of them was the charm -- at least part of the charm," Eartha Kitt said in a recent documentary on the Smiths. "I think they used it very well."
Decked out in the white ties and black tailcoats that were de rigueur for so many soirees in the 1930's, they were ceaselessly photographed themselves, whether surrounded by laughing chorines or posing for a liquor advertisement. Gordon Parks Sr. photographed them, both in plaid shirts, looking pensive.
Eventually, the Smiths set up shop a few doors down from the Apollo Theater, on 125th Street, where for three decades they photographed the city's African-American aristocracy. Their images of Fats Waller and Jackie Robinson are heroic; their picture of the swing-era Lindy Hoppers, heart-stopping.
When they arrived in the midst of the Depression with less than $100 between them, the brothers found jobs as park laborers. "We went to the state unemployment office and applied," Mr. Smith recalled. "Since we did have construction and gardening backgrounds, they did give us jobs in the Parks Department, cleaning cobblestones they took from Riverside Drive, to re-use." In their spare time, they took art classes. They shared an apartment on West 140th Street, eventually landing in two adjoining ateliers on 125th Street, with a placard outside that read: M. Smith Photo Studio -- Portraits of Quality.
In an exhibition of the Smiths' photography, "Harlem: The Vision of Morgan and Marvin Smith" at the Schomburg Center, Malcolm X Boulevard and 135th Street, through March 29, there is a room devoted to the Smiths' paintings, sculpture and surroundings. Photographs show their studio as a huge place with distinctive decor: Chinese vases turned into lamps, a fine velvet-covered settee, an ebony coffee table with legs in the form of elephant heads -- and an unusual pair of bookends, plaster casts of Joe Louis's fists. All those objects -- and more, collected over the years -- can be found in Mr. Smith's current home, a one-bedroom co-op in a massive red brick apartment house on Riverside Drive.
MARVIN Smith stood in his doorway, looking warily at a visitor. "Come in, come in," he said, standing aside, then smiling shyly. At 87, Mr. Smith is 6 feet 2 inches tall and speaks with the dignity of a Shakespearean actor. On this afternoon, he was dressed in a striped red shirt. Around his neck, he wore a tightly woven narrow kinte-cloth scarf he designed in burgundy, black and green.
These days, Mr. Smith walks slowly, and a trifle -- just a trifle -- unsteadily. "It's Parkinson's, but it's not too bad," he said. "People keep trying to do things for me," he said, "but I like to do for myself. Would you like some tea while I'm up?"
Mr. Smith doesn't spend a lot of time reminiscing. He is polite. He is succinct. He is not a rambler. He described Harlem in the early 1940's: "The War had sort of begun and a lot of friends were going away, and they were being photographed -- the families wanted pictures of their loved ones. It was very exciting. It's just that my number came up." Mr. Smith joined the Navy and became the first African-American to attend the Naval Air Station School of Photography and Motion Pictures in Pensacola, Fla.
Who were the celebrities he hung out with before the War?
"Lucky Millinder, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway," he said. "We went to parties with them, went to hear them play, mostly at the Savoy," he recalled. "Harlem was at the very center of New York life."
The brothers went everywhere with cameras. Sometimes they were paid. If they were, Morgan Smith once said, "it amounted to about $1.50 for a picture."
Their day-to-day work was commercial, mostly set-up studio portraits, but there were also news shots: Adam Clayton Powell Jr., leading a campaign against lynching; Mme. Chiang Kai-shek, and Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. The brothers became famous, at least in Harlem.
Gordon Parks Sr., in his introduction to the exhibition catalogue, describes the Smiths' business in the Depression: "The brothers' hearts were all future as they knocked upon the door of every major social event as well as those occasions involving problems of the impoverished and the dispossessed."
These days, Mr. Smith remembers only what it pleases him to remember. "The Depression? I am amazed how comfortable we were," he said. "The times that others considered bad, we didn't know anything about the Depression. In fact, we even had people in to eat! Dinner parties. Of course, people would bring things, but that was the practice at that time. The Depression was something in which we found ourselves -- a time in history." He paused. "We had everything we needed."
After the war, which brought prosperity, Mr. Smith traveled to Paris on the G.I. Bill of Rights to study painting with Ferdinand Leger, coming back to Harlem in 1954. In 1950, his brother had married a classically trained singer from Jamaica, and the couple lived in the second-floor studio. Mr. Smith took an apartment above them. When Morgan Smith and his wife had a baby, they moved out, and Marvin Smith moved back.
Starting in 1954, the brothers tried television: Morgan became a freelance sound engineer, Marvin a freelance set decorator for programs like the Molly Goldberg Show. Luxurious claret-colored velvet portieres with gold tassels over Mr. Smith's bedroom door came from a set.
In 1967, they gave up their lease on the photography studio. Eight years later, they retired from television, and Marvin Smith started his next career. With the 1970's had come macrame and crocheted vests; he began designing crocheting patterns for McCall's magazine. "Times change," he said, with a wisp of a shrug.
MORGAN and Marvin Smith were born in 1910 in rural Kentucky, in Nicholasville, near Lexington. "We lived in the country, and I guess we were a handful," Mr. Smith said. They were the first of their family to graduate from high school, and they found a series of mentors who encouraged their interest in art. One socialite introduced Marvin Smith to a Lexington artist, a woman who traded painting lessons for chores.
"Back then, you know, we couldn't be sitting here in the same room, a black person and a white person," he said. "I could use that lady's studio because I was working for her. We weren't considered equals."
The twins left Kentucky by bus. "After a slight disagreement, we went to the back of the bus," he said. "We really didn't have a choice."
Immediately inside the front door of Marvin Smith's apartment is a family photograph, taken during a visit to Kentucky, the year after they moved to New York. "Those are the girls, the girls we met at our art classes," Mr. Smith said with some embarrassment, gesturing to a pair of young women with identical plaid frocks. The two sisters -- identical twins -- had taken a fancy to the brothers. On the train ride home to Kentucky, he added, the young women persuaded the Smiths to have a double wedding. "But it didn't work -- we hadn't really had any time to, uh, to explore," Mr. Smith said. Three years later, on the same day, the couples divorced.
In the living room, there are more traces of his family. Over the couch is his painting of his parents on their one trip to New York. Mr. Smith added to the painting the family Bible "because they were both religious," he noted.
"I didn't have time to really finish it," said Mr. Smith, whose other paintings seem more polished, and as a result perhaps less appealing. "They weren't here very long."
The living room, which has a balcony that overlooks the Hudson River and, lately, the Fairway zipper sign advertising grocery deals of the week, is packed with memorabilia. He made the coffee table himself, laying glass atop a Victorian elephant head base. He hunted down a bronze elephant head in an antique shop and sat it on the desk in front of three glass panels he painted to look like stained glass. At the other end of the living room is a Jacobean-style bookcase with the casts of Joe Louis's fists that Mr. Smith made.
"At the time, Joe Louis was training up at Pompton Lakes, in New Jersey, and my brother and I used to go up there," he said. "Of course, when we went, we took models with us -- so we didn't need an introduction!"
The walls are laden with paintings. There is an autographed picture of Picasso, whom Mr. Smith met in the South of France after the war. There is a Haitian painting and, below it, a painting on glass by the sculptor James Denmark. On the back are papers about the painting, including the price when he bought it in 1975: $85. "I keep the papers there for my niece," he explained, referring to his brother's daughter, Monica. "In case something happens to me."
ALTHOUGH Mr. Smith likes his home, he is seldom there during the day. When he's not volunteering at the Hamilton Grange Nutrition Program, he's taking a foray to Fairway or showing people around the Schomburg Center exhibition. "I mean, it's kind of only fair of me," he said. "To share with people what I can, to tell them about the photographs." In all of the exhibitions, the photographs are attributed to both twins. "Sometimes I held the camera, sometimes he did," Mr. Smith explained.
The "discovery" of the twins and their photography started in 1992, the year before his brother died of cancer. They were honored by their home town, and a documentary was begun that was broadcast on PBS in 1995. A few months after Morgan Smith died, the University of Kentucky staged an exhibition; others followed. Their work was prominent in a Harlem photography show at the Smithsonian. "I've enjoyed it," Mr. Smith said.
Then it was time for a television interview, and he softly excused himself. "I only wish Morgan were standing right beside me, the way he always did," he said, and hesitated. "We were a real team."

HEADLINE: Let Western Water Flow

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "U.S. Acts to Meet Water Needs in the West" (news article, Dec. 19): There is no shortage of water in the West -- only a shortage of political will to let the free market set its price. Decades of government control of distribution and pricing have created a situation that defies economics and common sense. 
 Across the West, a relative handful of rich farmers grow thirsty crops like alfalfa and cotton in a desert climate while millions of city dwellers are told they are the problem because they water their tiny lawns or flush their toilets too often. If the United States was serious about meeting the water needs of Western states, it would remove price controls and let water flow to its highest and best use.

HEADLINE: Improving Mass Transit

 BODY:

To the Editor:
There are too many cars in Manhattan for too few streets, but simply raising tolls and lowering transit fares won't solve the problem ("Economy Purrs in High Gear, but Traffic Idles in Gridlock," front page, Dec. 22). Attitudes have to be changed to make transit the mode of choice, not just a reluctant option. Only through quality transit, day and night, can the need for a second car -- or even a first one -- be reduced. 
 Bus service is erratic on traffic-clogged streets. Light-rail efforts lag the rest of the world. Subways now have less rush-hour service than in the 1960's. Commuter trains may look modern, but their operations are stuck in the past.
Most of all, the region has a collection of lines, with mismatched schedules and fares, not an integrated whole.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Many Shows and Many Indias

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
If you like New York City, chances are you'll like India. Midtown Manhattan at lunchtime and an Indian village on market day are surprisingly alike. Cars and bikes charge by; personal space is at a premium; the noise level is high, the sheer variety of people exhausting. There are days when it's just too much, and you'd rather be anywhere else. But when you leave, if you leave, you can't wait to return.
The comparison has seemed particularly apt over the last year. The 50th anniversary of the independence of India and Pakistan from British rule arrived in August, and celebration surrounding the occasion has brought a steady flow of cultural riches to New York, including an unprecedented concentration of Indian art, old and new. 
 Two of the year's most spectacular exhibitions are on view, side by side, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. One, "King of the World: A Mogul Manuscript From the Royal Library, Windsor Castle," is a traveling show of the painted page from a single renowned 17th-century book. The other, "Flowers Underfoot: Indian Carpets of the Mogul Era," organized by the Met, is a gathering of some of the most beautiful rugs imaginable and, given the fragility of the work, a once-in-a-lifetime event.
To this list one must add "Mandala: The Architecture of Enlightenment," at the Asia Society, a much-anticipated show that, top-heavy with Tibetan material, ends up being a disappointingly incomplete study of its subject. Still, it offers some gorgeous objects, a few Indian in origin, all of them ultimately Indian in inspiration.
Perhaps the real news of the season, though, lies in the local appearance of contemporary art either from or about India in three recently opened exhibitions: "Out of India: Contemporary Art of the South Asian Diaspora" at the Queens Museum of Art," "Women Artists of India: A Celebration of Independence" at A Gallery in Chelsea, and "Francesco Clemente: Indian Watercolors" at the Met.
Widely varied in scale, content and polish, the shows together define the very different meanings that "Indian" can have. And they give at least a hint of the groundswell of creative activity not only on the subcontinent but also within its vast and widening sphere of influence abroad.
"Out of India" at the Queens Museum is by far the most ambitious show. Astutely selected and shaped by the curator, Jane Farver, it is a hybrid international showcase. Of its 27 artists, the majority were born in India, though fewer than half live there now. Others, Indian by descent, are from Myanmar (formerly Burma), Uganda, Ireland and the United States. Most take India as the subject of their work, but far less as a specific place than as a symbol, sometimes political but more often personal. Only one of the artists, Homai Vyarawalla (born 1913), actually witnessed the drama of August 1947. She was then a leading photojournalist in India, and her images of Jawaharlal Nehru addressing a jubilant crowd in Delhi, and of the body of Mohandas K. Gandhi being prepared for cremation, give a vivid sense of the mood of a nation whose self-image was cast in a romantic epic mold.
Much has happened since -- sectarian violence, economic upheaval, the extended medical emergency of AIDS -- to eat away at that initial tragedy-shadowed optimism. And the heightened, even exultant mood that runs through Ms. Vyarawalla's pictures is nowhere to be found in the work of her younger colleagues.
For example, in the photographs by Satish Sharma (born 1951), which hang across the gallery from hers, political figures appear not in person but as spectral public icons. A sculptured bust of Nehru crumbles from neglect; the face of Rajiv Gandhi peers out from a torn poster under a commercial sign reading "dynasty."
The work of Ayisha Abraham moves further back in time: her enlarged details of colonial-era photographs catch the uneasy social disparities of the English-Indian world of the Raj. Dayanita Singh, by contrast, turns her lens to the present to capture India's rapidly growing urban middle class, in whose lives Western and non-Western styles merge with a kind of surreal aplomb.
The Delhi-based journalist Pablo Bartholomew takes a similarly documentary approach in his pictures of Indians in the United States, from a Jain holy man enjoying tacos in upstate New York to hundreds of South Asian Muslims praying in the park that surrounds the Queens Museum. But other artists more clearly assume a critical, outsider stance.
Allan deSouza -- born in Kenya, now living in Los Angeles -- shoots the chilly, empty interiors of the arrival areas in American and European airports, which are often an immigrant's first glimpse of a new home. Sunil Gupta's grainy photomontages suggest the subjugated but vivifying Indian presence in England today.
And then there is work that invites ambivalent readings. Such is the case with Zarina Bhimji's illuminated transparency of what might be taken as the forbidding interior of a power station. It is actually a shot of the stacks of the British Library, where both Gandhi and Karl Marx formulated their ideas. Mohini Chandra's framed photographs may appear to be blank, and they are, in fact, the backs of snapshots, creating a hidden family portrait.
Portraiture, of the self or others, is a repeated theme in the show. Shani Mootoo, for example, creates a composite image of herself as a kind of nature spirit, half man and half woman, framed by panoramic views of wilderness in Canada, where she lives. And Chila Kumari Burman contributes a terrific collage of dozens of pictures of her own face in a Pop-flavored, kaleidoscopic play of identities.
(Ms. Burman, incidentally, along with Mr. deSouza, Mr. Gupta and several other British artists of Indian descent, is also included in "Transforming the Crown: African, Asian and Caribbean Artists in Britain, 1966-96," a three-part exhibition at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, the Franklin H. Williams Caribbean Cultural Center/African Diaspora Institute in Manhattan and the Studio Museum in Harlem, where the installation, by Jorge Daniel Veneciano, is especially good.)
Role-playing is also the essence of Poulomi Desai's series of portraits of Indian transvestites, which she titles "Shakti Queens." Shakti is a Sanskrit term for feminine spiritual energy. One senses this subversive energy, too, in the immense sculpture of a female head by Ravinder G. Reddy, in which the face has the features of a low-caste village woman but the golden skin of a goddess.
Apart from Mr. Reddy's work, sculpture in the show takes the form of installation. Rina Banerjee comes through with a packed, dangerous-looking environment of found materials and sari cloth; Vivan Sundaram with a walk-in paper house with a video image of a cooking fire; N. N. Rimzon with a snaking line of earthenware pots and brooms, an allusion to the status of the so-called untouchables, who were required to sweep the ground they walked on, and Shaheen Merali with an atmospheric video piece accompanied by his own music.
And some print work is included: chalky gray etchings by the New York-based artist Zarina showing the floor plans of homes she has lived in in Asia, Europe and the United States, Vijay Kumar's silhouetted crowds of figures set against newspaper reports of religious violence. But it is in the medium of painting that one finds some of the best entries.
This is certainly true of the three small pieces by Shahzia Sikander, the young artist (born in 1969 in Pakistan) now living in Houston, who was a standout at the recent Whitney Biennial and whose strong solo show closed last week at Deitch Projects in SoHo.
In Pakistan, Ms. Sikander studied the traditional art of miniature painting, a convention-bound art form requiring the use of hand-ground pigment and burnished paper and now often geared to the tourist market. She has revamped it in extremely imaginative ways by taking its signature image, the figure of the endlessly available woman awaiting the arrival of a lover, and setting it on a collision course with the psychic chaos of the contemporary world.
A piece like "Uprooted Order Series 3, No. 1," which is only inches high, interweaves Hindu, Islamic and personal emblems. The central woman grasping the branch of a tree is an ancient Indian symbol of fertility, but the cordlike roots dangling below her body seem to cripple rather than sustain her. The slightly raw, disjunctive, unfinished quality of the some of the work becomes part of its power.
Interestingly, "Out of India" introduces a second Pakistani artist, Miriam Ishaque, also in her 20's and a recent graduate of the Whitney Independent Study Program. Using egg tempera on panel, she adapts the precisely limned female figure of the miniature tradition but isolates it against a bare or lightly gridded flesh-pink ground. The effect is subdued, almost hesitant, but Ms. Ishaque is an artist to watch.
The show's selection of paintings is rounded out by two artists who live and work in India. The stainlike, calligraphic watercolors of Nalini Malani, 51, offer deliberately generalized scenes of coercion and violence within a patriarchal society. Atul Dodiya's semi-realistic oil-on-canvas paintings depict a polluted Bombay and the many-armed goddess Durga, who is usually shown holding a weapon in every hand, in the form of an airport metal detector.
 
Modernism Preserved
Ms. Malani's work also appears in the show at A Gallery, an exhibition originally organized by Mary-Ann Milford-Lutzker for Mills College Art Gallery in Oakland, Calif., last fall. It arrives in New York in radically truncated form and in an overcrowded installation. It is worth seeing, however, not only for its fine and influential artists but also because it touches on stylistic aspects of Indian art only glancingly addressed in the Queens show.
In the decades after independence, many vanguard painters, breaking away from both British academic models and traditional Indian styles, adopted Western modernism as the appropriately progressive style for a new nation. And in the form of a versatile, readily personalized, often semi-abstract figuration, it maintains its currency in India today, though its cachet has faded in the West.
It is the style practiced by several of the artists in the A Gallery show, among them Arpana Caur, Jayashree Chakravarty, Suruchi Chand, Kanchan Chander, Anupam Sud, Vasundhara Tewari, Gogi Saroj Pal and Rekha Rodwittiya. The results, inflected with specific Indian content, require a carefully judged presentation to look persuasive in trend-conscious New York. Unfortunately, they don't get that here.
Even under the circumstances, though, some things shine through. They include Ms. Malani's touching figure of a child dressing, Nilima Sheikh's lightly touched depictions of childbirth in tempera on handmade paper, and aquatints by Naina Dalal, two of which address the vulnerable status of unwanted female infants in India. Also worth seeking out are early abstract paintings by Arpita Singh, whose first New York solo show has been extended into January at Bose Pacia Modern Gallery in SoHo.
 
Inspiring an Italian Artist
If modernism was an import to the subcontinent, Indian art has, in its turn, been an inspiration for several Western artists. One is the Italian-born painter Francesco Clemente, represented in a small show of 19 watercolors organized by Holliday T. Day for the Indianapolis Museum of Art and now installed at the Metropolitan.
Since 1973, Mr. Clemente has spent part of every year in the southern city of Madras, and the big, grid-divided paintings in this show incorporate many Indian images: the elephant-headed Hindu god Ganesh, Buddhist lotuses and wheels, tantric configurations. In characteristic fashion, Mr. Clemente abstracts them slightly, smoothing and sweetening them in the process, as if to insure their viability as universal emblems.
Whether the results look too smooth, particularly when placed beside the densely textured, emotionally urgent paintings of Ms. Sikander (or those of Bhupen Khakhar, born in 1934, for whom a New York solo is long overdue) is a question. Mr. Clemente's work at the Met looks too easygoing for its own good, but he has produced far more provocative things, particularly when giving visual embodiment to the intensely erotic implications of Hindu devotional poetry.
In any case, the internationalist, crossover example he has consistently set is important, particularly in New York, where the most "advanced" art too often carries the whiff of a hermetic art-school parochialism. He has helped establish the climate for the reception of Indian work here and has undoubtedly given certain younger artists in India itself reason to believe they would find an audience abroad.
That audience is still, it is true, relatively small, but it will grow. At the moment Ms. Sikander must bear the unenviable burden of being a breakthrough figure, with work dynamic enough to capture the attention of viewers who have little direct knowledge of her sources. But there are other artists waiting in the wings to join her in an art world that is now global.
That's the basic message of "Out of India," and it is summed up in the work of the conceptual artist Navin Rawanchaikul, the show's youngest participant. Born of Indian parents in Thailand in 1971, he lives in Japan. In the conceptual piece created for the show, he has asked members of the Indian temple in his home city in Thailand to send postcard greetings to the show (many of the responses are on view) and invites visitors to the Queens Museum to send cards back in reply. (Just fill them out; the museum does the mailing.)
It's a simple gesture of reciprocity but a liberatingly expansive one, in which everyone is an artist and far-flung corners of the world become a common ground.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York City museums and art galleries this weekend. Galleries, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan and are open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 10 or 11 A.M. to 5 or 6 P.M.; gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.
 
Museums
 
"ART ON THE EDGE: FRAMING 19TH-CENTURY AMERICA," National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Jan. 11). An imposing frame, preferably gilded, was an important part of the "sell" of a 19th-century painting. The right frame in which to dress a painting for its all-important easel display was a must for artists, who purveyed works to patrons directly from their studios. Often, they designed their own frames. This selection, ranging from 1860 to the 1890's, presents a variety from the collection of Eli Wilner & Company, makers of period frames. They range from elaborate Barbizon-style models used to echo natural forms in paintings, to those reflecting the taste for Moorish designs in the 1880's, to a classically ornamented gilt frame by Stanford White with an outer shadow box of wood. But the show, pegged to the rising interest in frame connoisseurship, could use much better labeling about the how and why of these elaborate mounts, and especially the design elements that went into them. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 P.M.; Fridays to 8 P.M. Admission: $5; $3.50 for children under 16, students and the elderly (Grace Glueck). 

ROSA BONHEUR: "ALL NATURE'S CHILDREN," Dahesh Museum, 601 Fifth Avenue, at 48th Street, (212) 759-0606 (through Feb. 21). The painter Rosa Bonheur (1822-1899) was a legend in her own time, thanks not only to her skill at painting animals but also to her gender-flouting behavior. This show does not include her best-known canvas, the gigantic "Horse Fair" (1853), permanently on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. But it has preparatory sketches for the work, as well as paintings and sculptures of sheep, deer, fox, cows, bulls and Buffalo Bill, rendered from life astride his horse. Although uninventive, Bonheur's work was technically proficient and diligently observed, thanks in part to the considerable menagerie she kept at her estate near Fontainebleau. She got the anatomy right: her sheep are properly ovine and her dogs convincingly doggy, particularly the thoroughly unthoroughbred-looking hound named Barbaro in a lively 1870 painting that depicts the dog cooling down from a hunt. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Free admission ( Glueck).
"A DECADE OF COLLECTING: RECENT ACQUISITIONS IN CONTEMPORARY DRAWING," The Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9480 (through Jan. 13). Nearly half the museum's 200 works on paper made in the 1980's and 1990's are on view, so the exhibition adds up to a fair index of institutional preferences in this area and, by default, a snapshot of one aspect of recent art. There are few surprises, but piece by piece, and given the inevitable ups, downs and lacunas (a show five times the size would still only graze the surface of what's out there), the choices are good, and a handful (by Paul McCarthy, David Moreno, Patti Smith, Paul Thek) are refreshingly offbeat. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays, to 8:30 P.M. Admission: $9.50; $6.50, students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).
"FOUR ACTS IN GLASS: INSTALLATIONS BY CHIHULY, MORRIS, POWERS AND VALLIEN," American Craft Museum, 40 West 53d Street, Manhattan, (212) 956-3535 (through Jan. 18). Aiming to reveal the more dynamic uses of art glass beyond the making of unique objects, this uneven four-person show promises more than it delivers. The centerpiece is the best: a flamboyant glass tree by Dale Chihuly that rises almost floor-to-ceiling in the museum's atrium, thrusting out myriad "leaves" of snaky glass ampuls. An additional exhibit surveying Mr. Chihuly's work from 1965 to the present reveals his skill at coaxing glass into brilliant efflorescent shapes of dazzling color. The Swedish glass designer Bertil Vallien presents a regimented array of glass heads on pedestals, meant to evoke the 32-year trance of an injured schoolgirl who, on awakening, described visions of "great darkness and blue men." William Morris presents artifacts of blown glass, from animal skulls to prehistoric vessels, lined up on mural-size panels. Pike Powers's contribution is a kitschy mini-rendition of Coney Island sideshows, replete with figures of babies in bottles and freaky creatures in glass bell jars. But does this show "challenge our conception of the relationship of glass to its surroundings," as a wall label suggests it will? Nope. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Thursdays, to 8 P.M. Admission: $5; students and the elderly, $2.50; children under 12, free (Glueck).
HOWARD GILMAN GALLERY, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710. The inaugural exhibition (through Feb. 1) of the museum's new suite devoted exclusively to photography includes not only works by some of photography's early giants (William Henry Fox Talbot, Gustave Le Gray, Julia Margaret Cameron and Nadar), but also some odd specimens, including a picture of a crocodile dissection and a daguerreotype of a blind man. An intimate and relaxed show, this is a reflection of the random and urgent beginnings of photography, as well as the Gilman collection's luxurious depth. Hours: Fridays and Saturdays, 9:30 A.M. to 8:45 P.M.; Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M. Suggested admission: $8 for adults; $4 for students and the elderly (Sarah Boxer).
* "NEW CONCEPTS IN PRINTMAKING 1: PETER HALLEY," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400 (through Feb. 8). From a famously intellectual 80's art star who hasn't been too visible lately, a big, jazzy installation that shows his signature cell image -- variously interpreted as a jail, a battery or a power plant -- exploding or melting down. Its demise is clocked in a nine-panel comic-book sequence that recurs in several kinds of prints, including acres of wallpaper hung with art, a la Warhol. A wall painted radioactive yellow adds to the nuclear-accident tone. In addition, prints, illustrations and maps from the artist's collection -- for example, an 18th-century diagram of a sewer system -- further explicate his interests and inspirations. This is one of Mr. Halley's best efforts and certainly his most revealing. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays, to 8:30 P.M. Admission: $9.50; $6.50, students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).
MONA HATOUM, New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Feb. 22). This survey of work by the artist Mona Hatoum -- born in Beirut of Palestinian descent, now living in London -- was to celebrate the New Museum's reopening after a major interior expansion. Things happen; the refurbishment isn't finished. But the show is in place, and Ms. Hatoum's spare, evocative sculptures and installations look good. This is deeply emotional art that often speaks quietly but hides little: the body is relentlessly explored; the psychological wounds of lost childhood and of adult displacement probed. The vision is of a world at war, even when the battle is private and internal. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 P.M.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 P.M. Admission: $5; $3 for artists, students and the elderly; free for those 18 and under (Cotter).
THE FURNITURE OF GEORGE HUNZINGER: INVENTION AND INNOVATION IN 19TH-CENTURY AMERICA, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000 (through Feb. 15). This 40-object exhibition, accompanied by an exhaustive catalogue, is the first in-depth look at one of the great proto-modern designers of 19th-century America. Hunzinger, who was German-born, helped develop designs and techniques now basic to modern life, like the folding chair and the use of interchangeable parts. Most importantly, he cultivated structural leanness and truth in materials that shunned 19th-century revivalism and predicted the work of Josef Hoffman and Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Quite a bit of this is spelled out in Hunzinger's alternately forward-looking and not-so-forward-looking designs, most of them for chairs, which show furniture shedding its Victorian padding like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis (Smith).
"MASTER HAND: INDIVIDUALITY AND CREATIVITY AMONG YORUBA SCULPTORS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through March 1). African art is usually viewed as the anonymous product of a "tribal" entity. But in presenting the work -- masks, free-standing figures, containers and architectural elements -- of some 30 male and female master artists of the Yoruba culture in Nigeria, the Met establishes that they had their own individual styles that were recognized and esteemed by their countrymen. This is not Africa's most sophisticated art, but some outstanding exhibits include a case full of striking performance masks for the Gelede and Egungun cults, a poignant display of small memorial carvings of departed twins, and a veranda post depicting a royal personage by Olowe, a Yoruba master. Hours: Fridays and Saturdays, 9:30 A.M. to 8:45 P.M.; Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M. Suggested admission: $8 for adults; $4 for students and the elderly (Glueck).
"MEDIEVAL BEST SELLER: THE BOOK OF HOURS," Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-0610 (through Jan. 4). Drawing on the Morgan's stunning manuscript collection, this show is a systematic tour through the most popular devotional book of medieval and Renaissance Europe. One moves from a well-thumbed 15th-century starter "Book of Hours" for children, to the urbane grandeur of the "Farnese Hours," to the charming figures of Yolande de Soissons and her cat-size dog glancing up to see a statue of the infant Jesus waving at them from an altar. In this sociable exchange between the human and the divine, a whole universe of hope and belief comes to life. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays, to 6 P.M.; Sundays, noon to 6 P.M. Suggested admission: $6; $4 for students 12 and over and the elderly; under 12, free (Cotter).
"MONET AND THE MEDITERRANEAN," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 18). Yet another Monet show, this one with 65 mostly lesser-known paintings inspired by several trips he took, the first in 1883 to the Riviera, the last to Venice in 1908. In general, these Mediterranean views have been overshadowed by his other paintings for a reason. They're pretty, and occasionally boring, though one sees Monet adjusting to a new landscape, contriving a palette appropriate to the warm, enveloping southern light and to the tropical locale and pushing toward the sort of serialism that was to be his most creative reaction to Seurat and the other Post-Impressionists. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Sundays, 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. Holiday hours: today, Sunday, Jan. 2 and Jan. 4, 10 A.M. to 8 P.M.; Jan. 1, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission: $8; $4, students; $2, the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).
"NEW PHOTOGRAPHY 13," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9480 (through Jan. 13). This low-key show includes work by Rineke Dijkstra, Vik Muniz, Kunie Sugiura and An-My Le. Ms. Le's pictures of her homeland, Vietnam, with all overt traces of war removed, are especially moving. But Mr. Muniz is the alchemist of the group, incorporating sugar, chocolate and dirt into his work and giving them a witty symbolic spin. (A solo show of Ms. Sugiura's work is at Leslie Tonkonow Artworks and Projects, 601 West 26th Street, in Chelsea, through Jan. 10.) Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays, to 8:30 P.M. Admission: $9.50; $6.50 for students and the elderly (Cotter).
"ON THE EDGE: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM THE WERNER AND ELAINE DANNHEISSER COLLECTION," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400 (through Jan. 20). This important gift includes more than 80 works by artists like Bruce Nauman, Jeff Koons, Joseph Beuys, Sigmar Polke, Cindy Sherman and Robert Gober, filling out the Modern's accounting of recent art with often-challenging works in sculpture, video, installation art and large-scale photography. The relentless adherence to anointed names, however, gives an impersonal, predictable feeling to the collection and doesn't do much to change the Modern's own blue-chip orientation. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays, to 8:30 P.M. Admission: $9.50; $6.50, students and the elderly (Smith).
RICHARD POUSETTE-DART, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Feb. 22). Considered one of the best of the lesser-known Abstract Expressionists, Pousette-Dart (1916-1992) painted imposingly physical and mythically charged pictures. But he was more a symbolist than an Expressionist, and his art was driven less by darkness and conflict than by light, harmony and spiritual optimism. This could produce painting of vacuous prettiness, but it led as well, especially in the later phase of his career, to works of powerful emblematic presence, as can be seen in this 33-painting retrospective. Hours: Fridays and Saturdays, 9:30 A.M. to 8:45 P.M.; Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M. Suggested admission: $8; $4 for students and the elderly (Ken Johnson).
* "THE PRIVATE COLLECTION OF EDGAR DEGAS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 11). This unusual and handsome though overly large show proves that in the 1880's and 90's Degas was not entirely the old misanthrope he is said to have been. He was out buying art with a voraciousness to rival high rollers of the 1980's, but he had intelligence and taste. By his death in 1917 he had acquired a museum's worth of paintings, drawings and prints by Ingres, Delacroix, Manet and others. Around 300 are here, including Degas's Degases, a prime selection. The collection speaks to his own art. He bought 21 drawings and oil sketches related to Ingres's "Apotheosis of Homer," for example, and clearly grasped the episodic quality of these fragmentary images, which he turned into potent metaphors for modern life. He didn't acquire the greatest works by artists, but the ones that meant something particular to him, which, after all, is the right way to collect. And his passion for it should cause people to think twice about the common gripe that he is a chilly artist. Hours: Fridays and Saturdays, 9:30 A.M. to 8:45 P.M.; Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M. Suggested admission: $8; $4 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
ERNESTO PUJOL: "THE PICNIC," Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse (at 165th Street), the Bronx, (718) 681-6000 (through March 15). This single room-size piece pulls together references to the artist's Cuban heritage, Joshua Logan's film "Picnic" (of William Holden and Kim Novak fame), American nostalgia for frontier life, patriarchal culture and adolescent sexual confusion. That's a lot to tackle, but luckily Mr. Pujol comes through with a spare, carefully worked-out and amusing installation, which captures the eye, then gradually releases ideas. Hours: Wednesdays, 3 to 9 P.M.; Thursdays and Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, 1 to 6 P.M. Suggested donation: $3, $2 for students, $1 for the elderly (Cotter).
* "ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG: A RETROSPECTIVE," Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7); Guggenheim SoHo, 575 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 4). An extraordinary, imperfect and larger-than-life show by this extraordinary, imperfect and larger-than-life artist, now 71, the first great ecumenical figure of postwar American art and perhaps the only person with the energy to make it through the exhibition without the works eventually blending together. However much you may reject it, it still seems there for you and for the rest of the world, like a Saint Bernard, big, irrepressible and good-natured. At the same time, the show reveals what has tended to be overlooked: a delicate sense of loss in Mr. Rauschenberg's art that is revealed, for example, in his photographs of forlorn places and his images of single figures rapt in thought. Much of the work of the last 20-odd years doesn't match the inventive brilliance of the early years, so it's best to pick and choose. Hours uptown: Sundays through Wednesdays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, to 8 P.M. Hours downtown: Wednesdays through Fridays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Saturdays, to 8 P.M. Admission: $15; $10 for students and the elderly; includes admission to both parts of the retrospective (Kimmelman).
* "EGON SCHIELE: THE LEOPOLD COLLECTION, VIENNA," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9480 (through Jan. 4). Schiele, who was born in Austria in 1890 and died there at age 28, has been in vogue over the last few decades. But his work, with its X-rated subject matter, is only sporadically seen in bulk. This gathering of nearly 150 paintings and works on paper amounts to a total-immersion experience. The work -- virtuosic, narcissistic, corrosive, slight -- has a hectic feel, like a fever accompanied by chills, and it lines up in intriguing ways with the current trends in contemporary art. Schiele is one of modernism's more exotic honorable mentions, but he gives off a surprising heat. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays, to 8:30 P.M. Admission: $9.50; $6.50 for students and the elderly (Cotter).
* RICHARD SERRA: "TORQUED ELLIPSES," Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22d Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5912 (through June 14). After seeing the oval volumes of Borromini's Church of San Carlo in Rome, Richard Serra wondered what it would be like to make a sculpture in the form of a torqued ellipse: imagine a wall of steel forming an oval enclosure, twisting so that its top and bottom are not aligned. It took a year for him to make one of these. Three are on view, and they're amazing (though oddly colored) works of architectural sculpture; each is slit so that it can be entered. The shapes are weirdly impossible to resolve in the mind: to walk around the outside of one doesn't tell you what the inside is like, and vice versa; one searches in vain for the best place to stand. The unsettling effect recalls being exposed in a field when a storm approaches, an odd comparison with multi-ton sculptures, but the amazing thing here is how so much bulky metal can expand the space it occupies and set it in motion. Hours: Thursdays through Sunday, noon to 6 P.M. Admission: $4; $2, students over 10 and the elderly (Kimmelman).
* "TAINO: PRE-COLUMBIAN ART AND CULTURE FROM THE CARIBBEAN," El Museo del Barrio, Fifth Avenue at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272 (through May 3). When Columbus landed on the island that is now Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the Caribbean was home to the Taino, a people who had a complex culture and a distinctive art. This exhibition, the first comprehensive presentation of Taino work in North America, is a landmark achievement. It includes carved ceremonial stools, utensils associated with the ritual use of hallucinogenic drugs and mysterious triangular carved stones that compress human and animal anatomy into near-abstract forms. The show's centerpiece is a sacred figure made of materials from Africa, Europe and the New World, ingredients that virtually define the meaning of Hispanic as it is applied to a large segment of America's population today. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Cotter).
* "TRANSFORMING THE CROWN: AFRICAN, ASIAN AND CARIBBEAN ARTISTS IN BRITAIN, 1966-1996," Franklin H. Williams Caribbean Cultural Center/African Diaspora Institute, 408 West 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7420. Hours: Mondays through Fridays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M, Saturdays, noon to 5 P.M.; donation: $2. Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, the Bronx, (718) 681-6000. Hours: Wednesdays, 3 to 9 P.M., Thursdays and Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Saturdays and Sundays, 1 to 6 P.M.; suggested donation: $3, $2 for students, $1 for the elderly. Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Saturdays and Sundays, 1 to 6 P.M.; admission: $5, $3 for students and the elderly, $1 for those under 12. (All through March 15.) Much of the work in this sprawling exhibition is political, and how could it be otherwise? Almost all of the artists are British citizens but with cultural roots elsewhere: subjects of the Crown but with the critical perspective of outsiders. Like any survey, the show has its ups and downs and problems with focus. But it's packed with terrific artists, many showing in the United States for the first time, and it projects a unified force field of energy as palpable as it is hard to define (Cotter).
"THE WARHOL LOOK/GLAMOUR STYLE FASHION," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Jan. 18). Andy Warhol remains one of the most provocative American artists of the postwar years. It is almost impossible not to have complicated feelings about him, but his impact has been immense. Unfortunately, little of his importance is conveyed in this tame, patchy exhibition, organized by the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, which sets out to examine how fashion influenced Warhol and how he influenced it. Elaborately installed, this is basically a show of ephemera rather than of art. But no encounter with Warhol can be without interest, and this one has its moments: the section on drag is good; the Factory-era material in general is great. Hours: Wednesdays, and Fridays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 P.M. Admission: $8; $7, students and the elderly; free on Thursdays, 6 to 8 P.M. (Cotter).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
ANDREAS FEININGER, Bonni Benrubi, 52 East 76th Street, (212) 517-3766 (through Jan. 24). Mr. Feininger sampled a variety of modernist strategies during the 1930's before lighting out for America and going to work as a staff photographer for Time-Life. This selection of vintage prints from that era ranges from moody Parisian street scenes to almost completely abstract studies of nocturnal city lights, to technical experiments like a Rayogram of dandelion seeds or a reticulated negative print that atomizes and irradiates a female nude (Johnson).
MARKUS LUPERTZ, Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550 (through Jan. 10); Michael Werner Gallery, 21 East 67th Street, (212) 988-1623 (through Jan. 10). A German artist promoted in the early 1980's as part of the international Neo-Expressionist movement, Mr. Lupertz has come a long way from his work's early involvement with rebellion against German postwar prosperity. At Werner Gallery, he shows three monumental bronze figures that echo classical Greek sculpture and also Picasso. Rough and ungraceful, unprettily painted, they deliberately reveal the scars of their making. Their anti-heroic, existentialist stance is oddly compelling. His new landscape and still-life paintings at Knoedler & Company are less so. In them, he marries recognizable imagery with abstract passages, often using the device of a painting within a painting. In one, for instance, a dense black crow, reminiscent of Picasso's birds, flanks a vignette of netted and latticed lines. In another, traditional still-life props -- a skull, a bird, a vase -- are backed by an overall Pollocklike splatter of abstract forms. The show comes off as a disappointingly amiable homage to 20th-century masters (Glueck).
CY TWOMBLY, Gagosian, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through Jan. 10). Ten bronzes by an artist better known for painting and drawing. Things like cardboard boxes, boards, tree branches, flowers, wire and plaster are precariously joined, cast in bronze and given a chalky patina. The resulting works seem to exist as nostalgic reveries. Crude wheels attached to one end of an elongated triangle made of rough planks create a clumsy yet oddly delicate toy chariot, a memorial, perhaps, to childhood lost (Johnson).
 
Galleries: 57th Street
 
RICHARD BAKER, Washburn, 20 East 57th Street, (212) 397-6780 (through Jan. 17; closed Dec. 25 through Jan. 1). In many of Richard Baker's small, richly painted pictures, a single tulip or rose floats against a spacious sky. Pieces of miniature landscape are vignettes along the edges of the canvas. Set as they are against such celestial views, the flowers seem cosmic, although they are painted with a vivid, almost sculptural solidity. It's as though Mr. Baker were concentrating on Chardin while being haunted by the spirit of Blake (Johnson).
* BURGOYNE DILLER, "The Third Dimension: Sculpture and Drawings, 1930-1965," Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082 (through Jan. 17). A touching exercise in bittersweetness, this museum-quality show implies that the best American painter to fall under Mondrian's spell may actually have been a sculptor manque. It includes spare neo-plastic sculptures and wall reliefs from the early 1940's and bolder, more original works from the 1960's that relate to minimal art, along with dozens of purposeful drawings that brim with new ideas, most of them never realized (Smith).
* EGON SCHIELE, "1890-1918: Master Draftsman," Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 245-6734 (through Jan. 3). A concentrated examination of the artist's preferred medium, timed for the Museum of Modern Art's retrospective, this illuminating exhibition contains 75 drawings that span Schiele's brief career. Smaller and more succinct than the Modern's show, it reflects the gallery's 50-year involvement with Schiele's work and brings the viewer into unusually close contact with his febrile virtuosity. The sense of unremitting scrutiny and intensifying engagement with both the medium and the artist's models make this show enormously compelling (Smith).
TREVOR WINKFIELD, Tibor de Nagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050 (through Jan. 3). With near-perfect compositional pitch, Mr. Winkfield orchestrates a harmonic convergence of formalism, Surrealism and Pop. His flat, brightly colored, sharply outlined pictures produce a jazzy, Stuart Davis-like modernity. But in the layering and scrambling of all sorts of curiously archaic images from ancient, medieval, Victorian and early modern sources, they look like game boards designed by an addled English visionary (Johnson).
ANDREW WYETH, David Findlay Jr., 41 East 57th Street, (212) 486-7660 (through Jan. 8). If you're not a Wyeth lover, this high-quality selection of watercolors from five decades won't change your mind, but you may be impressed by how fresh his deft and loose works of the late 30's look. In "Winter Visitor" (1939), the crinkly play of pure-hued transparencies creates a bright, crisp winterscape; you can practically feel the bracing cold (Johnson).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
BRYAN CROCKETT, Fotouhi Cramer Gallery, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 431-1304 (through Jan. 15). In his first solo exhibition, Mr. Crockett, whose monstrous balloon sculpture was one of the hits of the last Whitney Biennial, shows only one fully realized balloon work along with various high-tech procedures to which he subjects his sculptures. He records their deflation on video, he makes Rayograms of them, and he puts one under glass in a vacuum machine (Johnson).
MELISSA MEYER: THE GARNER TULLIS PROJECT, Devon Golden Fine Art, 16 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 334-3124 (through Jan. 24). In these bright, gestural paintings on paper, Melissa Meyer skirts the muddiness that sometimes plagues her work. Her materials here are encaustic on heated paper (made available by the Gardner Tullis Workshop, which usually specializes in printmaking). The medium has improved the message, enabling Ms. Meyer's layered, variously colored, contrasting calligraphies to coexist with unusual stroke-by-stroke clarity (Smith).
* BEATRIZ MILHAZES, Edward Thorp Gallery, 103 Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 431-6880 (through Jan. 10; closed until Jan. 6). Ms. Milhazes, who lives in Brazil, has come through with a dazzling second New York solo show of abstract paintings. Her forms, often circular, seem to derive from textile patterns, architectural ornaments and the lacelike halos and vegetal filigree found in the colonial-period Baroque religious art of the Americas. Her surfaces, which suggest stamping, embossing and collage, deliberately keep the artist's personal touch at a slight remove, but only slight: the result is a sense of exhilarated, erotic concentration (Cotter).
"PARIS, CITY OF LIGHT: PHOTOGRAPHS BY BRUCE CRATSLEY, TODD WEBB AND ANDRE KERTESZ," Yancey Richardson Gallery, 560 Broadway, SoHo, (212) 343-1255 (through Jan. 3; closed until Jan. 2). The Todd Webb photos of Paris from the 1940's and '50's are lovely. But big attractions are Mr. Cratsley's lush black-and-white images. Several are of objects in Paris museums: Harry Houdini's top hat and wand in a vitrine at the Louvre, an upright bronze saint's hand, a 13th-century French tomb carving. Others are carefully edited studies of architecture. The effect is of an intense but restrained romanticism, as if the pictures were holding their breath (Cotter).
ROBERT WILLIAMS, Tony Shafrazi, 119 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 274-9300 (through Jan. 31; closed until Jan. 2). The former underground comic artist Robert Williams paints elaborate, tasteless allegories about modern times. They are supposed to be wild and shocking, but they are really just sophomoric and tediously complicated. The banal illustrator's style looks like that of Norman Rockwell's evil but less talented twin (Johnson).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
JANET CARDIFF AND GEORGE BURES MILLER: "DARK POOL," Morris-Healy Gallery, 530 West 22d Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-3753 (through Jan. 3). In a dimly lit, chaotic installation intended to invoke a dusty, musty 19th-century library or study -- maybe even a second-rate mind -- two artists have crammed old books, clothes, shoes, plates of food remnants, plastic tubing, a vintage typewriter, boxes, trunks and other kitsch, even a feathery pigeonlike thing that rattles on a spring when you approach it. Old-fashioned phonograph horns, triggered by sensors as you approach them, give out snatches of prosy "poetic" talk. There's nothing much more to be said about this work except that it's the kind of thing the Russian assemblagist Ilya Kabakov does a lot better (Glueck).
GEORGE CONDO AND WILLIAM BURROUGHS, "Collaborations 1988-1996," Pat Hearn Gallery, 530 West 22d Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-7366 (through Jan. 17). No doubt George Condo, the post-modernist painter, and William Burroughs, the Beat writer, had fun fooling around together in the studio, but you wouldn't know it from their paintings, which look like an assortment of works you might find in an undergraduate studio class. There are a couple of smallish homages to the painter Francis Bacon; some mixtures of cartoon imagery and abstract splatter, and several essays in action painting, some made with a toilet plunger (Johnson).
ANDREAS GURSKY, Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200 (through Jan. 3; closed Dec. 25 through Jan. 1). The large, handsome photographs converse with all kinds of other art, from Jackson Pollock to Damien Hirst. The results are best when the dialogue is internalized, as in pictures of the gargantuan and deserted atriums of two hotels: portraits of the alienating spectacle of modern life so weirdly masquerading as hard-edge abstraction (Smith).
YAYOI KUSAMA AND ANDY WARHOL, D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22d Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460 (through Jan. 31). An inspired curatorial coup brings together two silvery, pneumatic works of sculpture by two scenemakers of the 1960's. Andy Warhol's "Silver Clouds," big, metallic, helium-filled pillows shown in New York for the first time since 1966, bump around the ceiling or hover magically in midair; in the next room, Yayoi Kusama's "Snake" (1974), a 22-foot line of clustered, stuffed phalli, hugs the floor (Johnson).
GILES LYON, Alexandre de Folin, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-3434 (through Jan. 10). This painter, based in Houston, produces humorous, visually enthralling abstractions. In the most compelling, a symmetrically double-sided tangle of gnarly, tubular lines fills most of the medium-large canvas. Outlined cartoon-style and painted in Sunday funnies colors, these spacey yet slimy-looking networks look like cosmic visions from a psychedelic comic book (Johnson).
JOAN MITCHELL AND JOHN CHAMBERLAIN: A JUXTAPOSITION, Cheim & Read, 521 West 23d Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7727 (through Jan. 10). These two second-generation Abstract Expressionists, the painter Joan Mitchell (1926-1992) and the assemblagist John Chamberlain, were close in age and shared much in the way of cultural background. Each was addicted to color, using it to exuberant, explosive effect. The pairing of their works in this show is salubrious. Mitchell's passionate, lyrical canvases were impelled by the forces of nature; Chamberlain's cool assemblages of crushed auto parts are derived from man-made materials. Yet the shapes and colors used by each are remarkably compatible. The works play off one another with great panache (Glueck).
JAMES SIENA, Cristenrose Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0297 (through Jan. 10; closed until Jan. 6). Space under pressure is the operative concept in these meditative, delicately wrought enamel-on-aluminum abstractions. They perform optical tricks and bends without being at all tricky, partly because excellent use is made of the vagaries of the human hand, partly because the artist's materials add a cool sense of perfection and partly because Mr. Siena is unusually adept at translating the mental into the visual. His paintings think as good as they look (Smith).
 
Galleries: Other
 
"DESERT CLICHE: ISRAEL NOW -- LOCAL IMAGES," Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (through Feb. 4; closed until Jan. 6). Questioning the platitudes of Israeli life as perceived at home and abroad, 18 younger Israeli artists present often subversive and sometimes witty views on everything from the military to the "blooming" of the desert. A photographer, Gilad Ophir, shows the desert blooming with creeping suburbanization. The military is satirized by Nir Hod, whose glamorous photographs of soldiers are of ambiguous gender. The uneasy relationship between Arabs and Jews is symbolized by an Arab artist, Asim Abu-Shakra. He paints the tough desert cactus known as the sabra -- a name claimed by both Arabs and Israelis to designate a native of the country -- held captive indoors, his perception of the political situation of Arabs in Israel. Some of the ambivalent observations of these artists don't translate all that well, but at best the show takes sharp aim at Israeli and diaspora fancies about the land of milk and honey (Glueck).
INTIMATE SCULPTURE: ART SMITH AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES, MODERNIST JEWELRY, 1940-1965, Gansevoort Gallery, 72 Gansevoort Street, West Village, (212) 633-0555 (through Jan. 10). This ingeniously installed exhibition surveys the inventive "body sculpture" of Art Smith (1917-1982), a studio jeweler who had a shop in Greenwich Village from the late 1940's to the late 70's. Daring in both their structural clarity and use of the body as a living armature, Smith's designs are seen against the backdrop of his unusually talented generation of metalsmiths, including Ed Weiner, Paul Lobel and Sam Kramer (Smith).
SUSPENDED INSTANTS, Art in General, 79 Walker Street, lower Manhattan, (212) 219-0473 (through Jan. 10). The downtown half of a joint exhibition with the Sculpture Center (whose portion is now closed), this exhibition of sculptures and installation pieces by young artists from Brazil and New York examines their common interest in slight, ephemeral materials, or various semblances of levitation. Some manifestations of this interest are better than others, most notable being Seong Chen's delicate sculpture of crocheted paper printed with words, and Carla Guagliardi's wall piece, in which thin rods of iron are suspended in clear polyethylene tubes filled with water, which is reducing the iron to beautiful powdery rust (Smith).
 
Last Chance
 
THE ARTIST'S EYE, National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Sunday). For the National Academy's biennial series, Will Barnet, a member, has selected a motley show of 50 portraits from the academy's permanent collection. Highlights include a great self-portrait by Thomas Eakins, a horrific self-portrait by Ivan Albright, a small but richly painterly self-portrait by Lois Dodd and an etched self-portrait of fuzzy little dots by Chuck Close. Also on view are nine of Mr. Barnet's distinctively linear paintings. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 P.M.; Fridays, noon to 8 P.M. Admission: $5; $3.50 for the elderly (Johnson).
"CELEBRATING CANALETTO," Italian Cultural Institute, Park Avenue at 68th Street, (212) 879-4242 (through Wednesday). These etchings from the collection of the Arthur Ross Foundation mark the 300th anniversary of the birth of Giovanni Antonio Canal (1697-1768), better known as Canaletto, and the Italian Cultural Institute is raising a modest cheer in the form of this charming show of 30 of his prints. They include vistas of the lush, humid Italian countryside and postcard-ish views of Venice with "Grand Tour souvenir" written all over them. Certain scenes invented by the artist have the look of stage sets: neat as a pin, with shadows falling just so (Cotter).
I. RICE PEREIRA, Andre Zarre Gallery, 48 Greene Street, (212) 966-2222 (through tomorrow). The painter Irene Rice Pereira (1907-1971) had her first New York solo show in 1933 and a retrospective at the Whitney in 1953. This exhibition consists of a series of medium-large drawings made in the 1960's. Arabesque gestures in charcoal, accented by watercolor, delineate abstracted figures that look vaguely like Asian deities (Johnson).

HEADLINE: WEEKEND EXCURSION;
The Aura of History Spans the Delaware

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM

 BODY:
The editorial page of The New Hope Gazette carries a feature called "It's Been Said . . ." Among the latest republished sayings was this one, "The average tourist wants to go to places where there are no tourists." Surely this gentle bit of sarcasm is not lost on the local readers.
New Hope, Pa., is awash with tourists, as is Lambertville, N.J., its sibling and more sedate rival just 300 yards across the Delaware River. If the river could be drained and paved, the towns would become the largest outdoor pre-Revolutionary shopping mall in the Northeast. 
 But the prospect of recreational shopping wasn't the real reason why I spent a weekend in Bucks County, Pa., and Hunterdon County, N.J., one night in each camp. Despite the cheek-by-jowl glut of antiques shops, gift stores and restaurants, there is the smell of history along the river there, only a few minutes' drive upstream from the Pennsylvania ferry dock where General Washington and his ragtag flotilla set out on Christmas night 1777 to overrun a barracks of boozy Hessians at Trenton.
History in these parts is everywhere, still visible and accessible, once you filter out the parking meters and the "We Sell Herbal Ecstasy" sign in downtown New Hope. What once was, in most cases, still is. And at this time of year, all you need is a warm jacket, a good pair of walking shoes, a map and an imagination.
Other seasons offer ferry rides, the shad festival in April (Lambertville) and performances at the Bucks County Playhouse (April through December). But after the fall colors have faded and before the snow flies, there is a slightly quieter time -- not a lull, exactly -- that slows the reflexes of voracious antiques hunters and reminds the towns' publicans to ignite the logs in their hearths. Is there anything more inviting at this time of year than the smell of wood smoke? It's not shirt-sleeve weather anymore, but with Polartec, goose down and Thinsulate to protect you, who cares?
This is Americana at a comfortable remove and at your own pace, through architecture and geography. Hundreds of buildings are National Historic Landmarks, and even the most unambitious stroller will find that the present and the past coexist peacefully. Walk into the tidy stucco New Hope tourism headquarters, on Main Street, and you'll find that it was built as the first Village Hall, in 1790. The two public toilets, the man behind the desk said, were the original jail cells.
A short walk across the street is Martine's, a snug tavern for lunch or dinner near the riverbank. It dates to the mid-18th century, when its owners sold salt to preserve meat. It's just a few steps from one of the original ferry docks, which are pivotal to the history of the two towns. Lambertville and New Hope had the good fortune to be on the main stagecoach route between New York and Philadelphia. A formidable obstacle was the river, so one of the earliest settlers, Emanuel Coryell, established a ferry to link New Jersey with Pennsylvania.
The Coryells were able boatmen but lackluster politicians. John Lambert, a descendant of another early family and a United States Senator from 1809 to 1815, persuaded the Federal Government to designate the local post office as Lambertville. Since then, the Coryells have had to be content to see their name on street signs.
You don't have to look hard to find two other significant aspects of the area's early economic development: the mule-barge canals and the railroad.
In Lambertville, it's the Delaware and Raritan Canal, which ran from Bull's Island (north of Lambertville) to Trenton, linking up with the main canal that carried commerce east to the Raritan River and eventually New York. In New Hope, it's the Delaware Canal, which ran between Easton and Bristol. Both were augmented and eventually supplanted by rail, the Reading line in New Hope and the Belvidere & Delaware, a branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad, in New Jersey.
But before we go further, a suggestion. This is not a theme park. Small children will not have a good time, unless they really like to walk what will seem to them long distances and go in and out of stores that sell sweaters, antiques and wine. There is a good ice cream shop in New Hope (Gerenser's) and a store in Lambertville devoted solely to toys (the Five and Dime), but the toys are the toys you owned: Howdy Doody wind-ups, Dinky military vehicles, Tinkertoys. Do yourself a favor: leave the younger ones at home. (Teen-age girls, however, will find the shopping totally awesome. Trust me on this.)
I had originally planned to come alone, maybe even get some reading done in late evening after dinner. But then Kate, my 16-year-old, made arrangements to visit a friend in Moorestown, about an hour's drive south. So I invited her to come along on Friday after school. We left northern New Jersey at 5 P.M., got caught in weekend rush-hour traffic and made the 90-minute, 75-mile trip in two and a half hours.
Our first sight of Lambertville was Bridge Street, the narrow two-lane, east-west link between the towns, and it made the tedious drive worthwhile. Even in the dark, we could clearly see the old facades and the care the borough had taken to preserve a sense of decorum that capitalism could have shattered long ago. Kate came right to the point; she liked the quaintness a lot, but she liked capitalism even more.
We oohed and aahed at the neat Federal and Victorian houses and shops and rolled past the stately Lambertville House, a recently restored 1812 inn where I would stay on Saturday night.
We pushed on, across the bridge and into New Hope, where we turned left onto Main Street, which runs parallel to the river. After settling in at the New Hope Inn, we backtracked to Lambertville and the mid-19th-century railroad station, which is now a restaurant.
Walking past a horse-and-carriage for hire, we entered the restaurant lobby. We sat at a window table and looked out at twinkling lights and the old Belvidere & Delaware track, now used only for excursion trains.
Kate never got to go shopping. We turned in early, and the next day she was off to visit her friend. I spent Saturday in Lambertville and Sunday in New Hope, wandering at random. One of my first stops was a cozy bookstore, the Rivergate, at 7 Lambert Lane along the river, which carries a nice selection of everything, including local guidebooks. One, a Lambertville cookbook, is published by the Kalmia Club, a women's civic organization that started as a reading circle a century ago, taking its name from the mountain laurel (kalmia latifolia) that bloom on the hillsides.
Across the street was the casually named Jim's Antiques. Jim, it must be said, has eclectic taste and is not afraid to charge for it. There's some serious French, English and American furniture as well as lots of outlandish decorative stuff. I was drawn to the twin skeleton chairs, at $5,500 each, made of wood in white lacquer and resembling seated human skeletons. And the Louis XVI-style sedan chair (circa 1780-1820), for $6,900. The pair of African elephant tusks (from a 1930's safari) goes for $16,000.
A final touch: on the front lawn stands a life-size bronze elk, Jim's tip of the hat to the Elk's Club, the previous tenant.
One of my last stops of the day was a wine tasting at the Tomasello Winery shop on North Union Street. The winery, in Hammonton in Atlantic County, N.J., was established in 1933 and turns out some surprisingly tasty, inexpensive varieties, including a large selection of dessert wines.
One Lambertville regret: I had only a muffin and coffee at a Bridge Street luncheonette called Sneddon's. It is a classic short-order restaurant, basically one big room with tables, and a counter with a dozen or so stools. At the long griddle, a small army of men and women prepare omelets, flapjacks and waffles till 11:30 A.M., and then start on lunch. It is the busiest and most unpretentious place on either side of the river.
The newly refurbished Lambertville House, where I spent Saturday night, was probably as much luxury as I was likely to find in the area. And once I figured out how to turn off the state-of-the-art water jets in the bathtub, I could really relax. The inn provided a wonderfully complete breakfast (cereal, quiche, muffins, fruit and coffee), after which I checked out and drove over to New Hope. Weary of parking meters (25 cents a half-hour), I pulled into an all-day lot for $5.
The lot, it turned out, abutted the old Reading tracks that serve the New Hope & Ivyland Railroad, an excursion line that ventures about 10 miles into Bucks County, a kind of steam cruise to nowhere. In wintry weather, the station is warmed by a cast-iron potbelly stove, stoked with coal. The sweet sulfury smell is distinctive. (If you ever went through basic combat training in the winter, you'd remember stoves like these heating huts on the rifle range.)
Sense memories were abundant. Colonial America, only a block away, at the railroad crossing, had become early 20th-century America.
As I moved closer to the warmth, thick clouds of steam from a sleek black engine, old No. 40, made at the Baldwin works in Philadelphia in 1925, washed up onto the platform and over the roof, momentarily obscuring the ticket window and the clamoring passengers. Time stopped. I caught the 11:30.

HEADLINE: Growth in Film and T.V. Jobs Seen for L.A.

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Growing demand for films and television shows is forecast to create an additional 16,000 entertainment industry jobs in Los Angeles County in 1998, a 12 percent increase that is more than five times the county's overall growth rate.
The projected new jobs in the $20-billion-a-year industry, disclosed in a forecast from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, will represent nearly a fifth of all new employment positions created in the region next year. 
 Jack Kyser, the development agency's chief economist, said product demand was driving the sector's growth. Mr. Kyser said production of television commercials was also growing in the region.
The entertainment industry's growth rate is expected to be a little slower than 1997's 17 percent gain, which saw 20,000 new jobs created.
The survey also projected creation next year of 12,900 jobs indirectly related to show business like entertainment accountants, lawyers, caterers and tailors, giving the category 137,300 jobs over all.
The county's job rate growth for 1998 over all was forecast at 2.1 percent, or 81,000 new jobs, pushing the total to nearly four million. That also represents a slight slowing from the 1997 gain of 2.3 percent, or 89,000 jobs.

HEADLINE: RETAILERS FINDING SALES DISAPPOINT FOR THE HOLIDAYS

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
A sparkling economy, record-low unemployment and fatter paychecks failed to translate into the strapping holiday selling season American retailers were counting on.
Although industry sales figures will not be released until Jan. 8, retailers and those who watch them estimated that sales in stores open at least one year rose a scant 2 percent to 3 percent in December from a year earlier -- half the gain some analysts had been touting at the start of the season. 
 This lackluster performance was the third in a row for retailers, despite the strength of the American economy and the wealth-generating gains in the stock market. Analysts said it underscored the harsh necessity for retailers to come to grips with the diminishing role of Christmas-season sales and to find more creative ways to get people to part with their dollars.
"It took stores years to learn that Easter had disappeared as a selling holiday," said Peter Schaeffer, a retail analyst at Dillon Read. "And after three years in a row of weakness, they have to realize that you can't count on Christmas anymore either. In all honesty, it is much more profitable to get sales in October than in December these days."
Indeed, even where sales were strong, profit margins were often weak. From the day after Thanksgiving on, sweater racks were decorated with 25-percent-off signs in many women's clothing shops. Department stores mailed coupons to shoppers offering extra savings, while computer merchants rang up strong sales only by lowering prices.
"We started off with a bang, and then had a lull, and, unfortunately, the final weekend sales were not what we had hoped for," said Bruce Van Kleeck, vice president of the National Retail Federation. "Mainstream department stores were struggling. Discounters did reasonably well, as did luxury stores, but even the discounters said they saw weekend sales declining."
The last blockbuster Christmas for retailers was 1992, when the biggest merchants' sales rose 8 percent over the previous year as the economy strengthened. Since then, sales gains have rarely exceeded the inflation rate; even in 1994, when big chains' sales rose 4.5 percent, profit margins were slim and stores were busiest during after-Christmas clearances.
Economists and analysts have attributed that tepid performance to rising levels of consumer debt, the diminishing tendency of extended families to gather around the Christmas tree and the simple exhaustion of working couples who cannot muster the energy to go to the mall. Merchants have struggled to find any explanation at all.
This year, even Hanukkah, which tends to give the season a lift -- at least in cities with large Jewish populations -- has not provided the kick that retailers hoped for, perhaps because the holiday began late this year, not until Tuesday evening.
"What I want to know is, where did Hanukkah go?" asked Michael Gould, chief executive of Bloomingdale's, a unit of Federated Department Stores Inc., which has stores in the New York and Los Angeles areas. "You just didn't see that pop this year." The new shopping pattern, he added, is that "there really is more giving all year long now."
Many themes that have defined the holiday selling season in recent years resurfaced this year.
Generally, stores that serve the wealthy seemed to fare better than those that cater to the middle slices of the market. Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue executives boasted about sales of fancy party dresses, jewelry and cashmere, but merchants that compete on price were less than happy.
"While the last few days were better, sales were overall below plan," said Duncan Muir, a spokesman for J. C. Penney. "There are so many theories out there as to why, but I think you have to consider credit-card debt." Personal bankruptcies have hit an all-time high, and consumer installment credit totals $1.2 trillion, half again as much as just four years ago.
The hot products of the season were oddly familiar, too, as if Americans have decided that it just is not the holidays without chenille sweaters, velvet bras, men's golf shirts and Dentist Barbies. Items for the home, from bread makers to scented candles to Tuscan platters, continued to be huge draws. In the last week, traffic in housewares stores like Pottery Barn, a unit of Williams-Sonoma Inc., and Crate and Barrel, a unit of Euromarket Designs, was much heavier than in stores selling apparel.
How hip were housewares? The actress Gwyneth Paltrow was spotted this week in a Williams-Sonoma store in Chelsea buying last-minute gifts.
Perhaps most important, from the standpoint of the season's profitability, major markdowns are now as integral to holiday shopping as mistletoe, dreidels and Salvation Army bell ringers.
"This Christmas selling season was one big bargain hunt," said Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, a trade publication.
Small, ominous symbols of the season's sluggishness were everywhere. CompUSA was handing out free videocassette recorders with computer purchases. The hottest toy was a doll that snores. And retailers who traditionally looked to the Friday after Thanksgiving for their biggest sales day are now hoping that today, when shoppers go hunting for even better bargains, will give them a final sales lift.
"The day after Christmas should be powerful," said Mr. Van Kleeck of the National Retail Federation. "It should be absolute bedlam in the mall."
Sears, Roebuck & Company executives said that after-Christmas shopping is as important as the entire month of December. "Our holiday season embraces the first week of January," Jan Drummond, a spokeswoman for the company, said.
The issues dogging the retail industry range from the secular to the sociological, and the challenges may take years to work through.
More than ever, department and specialty stores that cater to middle- and lower-income shoppers compete with discounters like Target Stores, a unit of Dayton Hudson, and Wal-Mart Stores in selling goods from toasters to electronic toys to basic apparel, like turtlenecks and stretch pants.
Families are more dispersed now; people are more likely to spend the holidays in smaller groups scattered around the country than as one large family unit, which cuts down on buying. Shoppers consider it too much effort to run out to the mall after a 10-hour workday to buy and mail gifts to a dozen people, or they may have no idea what to buy for a teen-age nephew they never see.
"A lot of people are drawing names now instead of buying for all their siblings," said Audrey Gusky, a marketing professor at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. "People have such a limit on their time and have so many other things to think about in two-career families, it is just as easy to go get a gift certificate." That way, she said, "all you have to do is stick a little envelope in the mail."
Indeed, many retail executives said that gift certificate sales have risen sharply in the last three years. And that, of course, means more consumers are taking advantage of ever-bigger post-Christmas sales.
The slump in holiday shopping is clearly not caused by a lack of money to be spent. Personal income rose eight-tenths of one percent last month, the 13th consecutive monthly gain and the largest since June 1996.
But consumers, increasingly, have demonstrated a penchant for spending their money on things other than store-bought merchandise, such as travel and personal services. Affluent baby boomers, apparently having run out of things to buy, are indulging in mud masks at the spa and trips to St. Kitts; travel industry revenues are soaring while retail sales stagnate.
"I think there is some relationship between Christmas sales and the aging baby boomers," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. "Years ago, they were just starting to have kids and they splurged on them. But that novelty wears off."
Rather than help retailers, in some ways the strong economy has hurt. For example, low unemployment forced merchants this year to entice seasonal help with higher pay and better perks. "If anyone is going to get squeezed by a tight labor market and minimum-wage increases, it is going to be people doing seasonal hiring, and they don't see it coming back in terms of big revenue gains," said David Blitzer, chief economist at the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
And there is no threat of inflation to scare shoppers into making purchases sooner rather than later.
"People are not going to rush out and buy because they think it will cost more money next week," said Mr. Blitzer. "And that means that price cuts, when you take them, really hurt."
Going forward, retailers may stop looking at leading economic indicators as a crystal ball for holiday sales. "For years and years, you could base your predictions on history," noted Mr. Van Kleeck of the National Retail Federation. "We are rewriting history season by season now."

HEADLINE: Philosophers Find the Degree Pays Off in Life And in Work

BYLINE: By CAROL MARIE CROPPER 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.

 BODY:
What can you do with a philosophy degree?
In an age of M.B.A.'s and computer scientists, more than 4,000 American college students graduate each year with a bachelor's degree in the ancient discipline. Sometimes their parents and friends wonder what will happen to them. 
 One thing is certain: Not many of them will go on to make a living as philosophers. Even those who persevere through a doctorate may wind up doing something else. More than 1,000 people with Ph.D's in philosophy applied for the 448 openings listed in the last year in "Jobs for Philosophers," said Eric Hoffman, executive director of the American Philosophical Association. And many of those jobs were temporary or nontenure-track teaching positions.
Yet students majoring in philosophy -- the study of the principles underlying conduct, thought and knowledge -- seem passionately unconcerned.
Shaharyar Khan, a philosophy major at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, is one of a handful of seniors selected to live in the early 19th-century academic village designed here by Thomas Jefferson. He awakens each morning in a dormitory room that opens onto the university's mist-covered lawn, with the rotunda that Jefferson modeled on the Pantheon rising to his left.
"We look at what we do, how we justify things," the 22-year-old said of his philosophy classes. "In that there is sublimity and nobility."
Mr. Khan plans to go to medical school -- if he is not seduced by an academic career. He considered majoring in a science but decided he would get enough of that later. Philosophy was his personal luxury. "This was something I could do for myself," he said.
But what of other philosophy majors? What do they do when confronted with the real world, where there are groceries to buy and mortgages to pay? How do they compete for jobs with all those sensible accounting and engineering majors?
For all the jokes about them, philosophy majors appear to do remarkably well. That, at least, is the conclusion one can draw from an unscientific survey, 20 years after graduation, of the class of 1977 at four schools: Princeton University, the University of Virginia, the University of Nebraska and Texas A & M University.
These 40-somethings fell in love with philosophy almost by accident and went on to careers in other fields. But for the most part they are convinced that their studies, which covered logic and ethics among other topics, helped them in their jobs and their lives.
Their professional success may stem from the fact that philosophy students seem more likely than those with other degrees to attend graduate or professional school. Of 20 philosophy majors interviewed from the four universities, only four had not added a graduate or professional degree.
"I suppose I'm lucky I got into medical school," said Joseph P. Bruner, who graduated from Nebraska. "I would have probably wound up parking cars otherwise."
Or maybe not. Jorge Secada, director of undergraduate studies in philosophy at Virginia, said his students almost always found jobs -- though not in philosophy. "We are doing better in finding employment for graduates than most majors in the arts and sciences area," he said. "Apparently people in the real world think philosophy majors are well trained. They are trained to think, to analyze. They express themselves well. They write."
At Texas A & M, philosophy majors -- like math and music students -- are benefiting these days from a job market desperate for computer scientists, said Dr. Leigh Turner, director of the university's career center. Students with such majors are thought to have an aptitude for technology jobs, she said.
In the early days of this century, philosophy was thought of as fundamental to a well-rounded liberal arts education, Mr. Hoffman of the American Philosophical Association said. Considered more than just the teachings of Socrates, Aristotle and Plato, philosophy was regarded as a broad search for knowledge, encompassing the latest scientific and social theories.
But that was before those concerns became independent fields of study, leaving philosophy with a narrower focus. And it was before college-age baby boomers gave way to a baby bust. Cash-starved colleges started looking for departments to trim. And students, watching the cost of a college education at selective private schools soar, turned into pragmatic consumers weighing the economic value of a diploma that could put them in debt by more than $100,000.
By 1994, one survey found that a philosophy course was required at only 18 percent of colleges, Mr. Hoffman said. Between 1992 and 1996, more than 400 standalone philosophy departments disappeared, according to the Directory of American Philosophers. Schools offering a major in the subject slipped from 683 to 660; those offering even scattered courses plummeted from 947 to 606.
All this occurred despite the fact that philosophy, in the last 20 years, has taken a more marketable turn as the issues faced in industry and the professions have grown more complex.
Dr. Bruner's career hints at the changes. He heads a medical team, including two ethicists, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville that developed a surgical procedure for repairing spina bifida in fetuses. The procedure raised several ethical issues -- whether, for instance, it is appropriate to perform an operation that could kill a fetus incapable of giving consent to repair a condition that is not life-threatening.
"We've published almost as many articles on the ethics issues as on the medical issues," Dr. Bruner said.
While so many other schools were cutting back, Princeton has maintained what is widely considered one of the best philosophy departments in the country. Its famous graduates include Carl C. Icahn, the financier, who earned his B.A. in 1957; his senior thesis was titled "The Problem of Formulating an Adequate Explication of the Empiricist Criterion of Meaning." Philosophy majors in the class of 1977 have spent the last two decades building striking resumes -- just not in philosophy.
Jay M. Behmke, 42, did what so many philosophy majors do: He became a lawyer. But he built a practical career with a twist. After a few years in corporate law, followed by a year teaching in France as a Fulbright Scholar, Mr. Behmke returned to American wine country and became the chief financial officer at a winery. He then opened a law practice in Sonoma County, Calif., representing vineyards.
"Some days I'm sorry I didn't go on as a professor, because I did have some things to say," said Mr. Behmke, who taught undergraduate philosophy courses at Yale while attending law school there. "I have a fantasy of making a fortune and retiring early and teaching philosophy."
More men than women study philosophy; Nanci Heller McAlpin, a freelance writer in Manhattan, was the lone female philosophy major in Princeton's class of 1977. She knew from the start that she was not earning a practical degree.
"When we entered the department, we were handed a paper and it said, 'Why not to go to graduate school in philosophy,' " Ms. McAlpin recalled.
Such discouragements by Princeton and other schools apparently worked. The number of students earning doctorates in philosophy dropped to 298 in 1995 from 382 in 1976 and dipped as low as 215 in 1984, according to various studies.
But almost 92 percent of those with doctorates in philosophy were employed full time in 1995, compared with 85 percent of those with music Ph.D.'s and 87 percent with Ph.D.'s in art history, according to a study by the National Research Council. The median income for philosophy Ph.D.'s that year was $46,800, compared with median 1995 earnings of $48,100 for engineers and $124,000 for family doctors.
Unlike students who choose a major with a career in mind, philosophers typically fall into the subject by taking a class they enjoy, said Mr. Secada of the University of Virginia. One recent day here, students listened as Prof. James Cargile lectured on the utilitarian theory of justice, which holds that justice can be arrived at by weighing such things as the total happiness an act produces. But if that makes sense, he asked, should the person who enjoys wealth the most have more of it than others? In another class, Richard Rorty, one of the nation's best-known philosophers, discussed Nietzsche's thoughts on homosexuality and celibacy.
Like Princeton's, Virginia's class of '77 produced its share of lawyers, but graduates also headed for such typical philosophers' occupations as medicine and computing. And some who chose law came to it circuitously.
After graduation, Ralph Gilbert 3d turned to a profession of which Jefferson would have approved. He raised soybeans, sheep and pigs on his family's North Carolina farm for five years before drought, corn mold and mounting debt drove him from farming into law.
Mr. Gilbert, who is 45, said he still read philosophy and enjoyed philosophical discussions with a friend who is an Episcopal minister. He toys with the idea of going back to school for a divinity degree. But he credits philosophy with helping him neither in farming nor law; it has only improved his life.
"I think it influences the way I go about doing things," Mr. Gilbert said. "I think it's given me a sense of the complications that we face as human beings. It gives me a sense of the beauty and wonder of life. It helps me understand people in dire circumstances."
Of all the gifts that his philosophy degree has given him, said Dr. Bruner, the Nebraska graduate, creativity is probably the most important. Those who majored in science, then headed straight for medical school and years of practice can have a narrow outlook, he said.
"They don't have enough raw data outside their scientific training to provide those insights, those flashes of creativity," he said.
Philosophy has many strains, of course -- not all of them quite so evocative of those moments of Romantic inspiration. Briggs Myrick, a 1977 Texas A & M graduate, became a sales clerk and manager at a hardware store after college. But within three years -- and without further training -- he was programming computers at the university. The leap was easy, he said: A lot of the early computer scientists were philosophers.
"In philosophy, we study logic," he said. "We have a very mathematical way of going about it. Computers are a lot like that as well."
Both philosophers and computer programmers use Boolean logic, Mr. Myrick explained, though philosophers are more likely to call it Aristotelian logic. "Any assertion is either true or false," he said. "If it is true or false, it can be on or off. And it can be a switch. And computers have a lot of little, tiny switches."
Of course, philosophy majors work in fields other than law, medicine and computer science -- especially if they set out into the working world with just a bachelor's degree.
One Princeton graduate shelved books in libraries to support his interest in acting before returning to school years later for a master's degree in library science. One 1977 Virginia graduate sells herbs and flowers; another owns a service station.
Some 1977 philosophy graduates earn less than $30,000 a year; the herb seller expects to clear $6,000 in 1997. But more common are incomes of $50,000 or $60,000, and a few earn more than $200,000.
Money aside, Dr. Bruner figures that his philosophy degree helped make his medical career possible -- though there were moments of doubt. The 44-year-old obstetrician still recalls sitting before the admissions panel at the University of Nebraska College of Medicine, scrambling to explain why he wanted to be a doctor after majoring in philosophy.
"I told them that I could get a medical degree and still, to some extent, practice philosophy," he said. "But if I stayed in philosophy and tried to practice medicine, they'd probably try to put me in jail.
"Not one of them cracked a smile."

NBC Losing 'Seinfeld' At the End of the Season
The most popular television comedy of the 1990's, "Seinfeld," will shut down production at the end of this season. The decision by the show's creator and star, Jerry Seinfeld, is a blow to NBC, which has seen its prime-time strength weaken this season. 
 "Seinfeld" has anchored Thursday night programming at NBC since 1993, leading the network, which is owned by General Electric, to its No. 1 position. "Seinfeld" alone has made more than $200 million a year in profits for NBC, according to advertising industry estimates. The network had offered a deal that would have been the richest in television history if Mr. Seinfeld had agreed to continue the show for just one more year. Page A1.

U.S. Markets Reopen
Financial markets in the United States and in some other countries reopen today after being closed yesterday for Christmas. The New York Stock Exchange will close at 1 P.M. and bond trading will end around 2 P.M. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 19/32 , to 103 Wednesday. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.91 percent Wednesday (as shown above) from 5.87 percent Tuesday. As the last week of the year approaches, long-term interest rates are close to levels that investors have not seen for almost 30 years. Whether yields fall to that 5.75 percent range will depend on how quickly the robust United States economy, which grew at a pace of nearly 4 percent through the third quarter, begins to slow.

HEADLINE: Lack of Work Made Suspect Snap, Friends Say

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DENVER, Dec. 25

 BODY:
A dismissed postal employee who held seven people hostage at a regional mail center on Christmas Eve may have snapped because he had been unemployed for 18 months, some who knew him said today.
The suspect, David Lee Jackson, 42, made a brief appearance in court today and was held on a $1 million bond on investigation of kidnapping, felony menacing and burglary. 
 Armed with a shotgun and dressed in camouflage and body armor, Mr. Jackson walked into a huge mailing center in Denver on Wednesday and held his hostages for nearly 10 hours, the police said. No one was hurt.
Negotiators said Mr. Jackson got tired and finally asked, "How do I get out of this mess?"
The police believe Mr. Jackson was seeking revenge over his dismissal for threatening a supervisor.
Robert Thompson, who knew Mr. Jackson, said he had never shown signs of violence.
"He might have snapped or something, but this wasn't like D.J.," Mr. Thompson said.
Johnny Peevy, whose wife, Paula Peevy, was a hostage, recalled meeting Mr. Jackson several years ago. Mr. Peevy said Mr. Jackson was "a pretty low-key individual, and he and my wife got along fine."
Some of Mr. Jackson's friends said he was being treated unfairly by the Postal Service's appeal process.
But another former co-worker, Bill Schmeiser, said: "Last time I saw him, he stated to me, 'If I ever step inside this building again, you better step aside, because I'm going to take care of business, and you know I got the weapons to do it.' "
The lawyer who represented Mr. Jackson last year in his employment case said he was bewildered by the incident.
"We weren't happy with the results," said the lawyer, John Evangelisti. "But he wasn't agitated about it."
Postal service officials would not comment on Mr. Jackson's employment record.
For the families of the five men and two women held hostage, their freedom was the gift they were praying for.
"It's the best I could ever ask for," Ken Martinez said after he was reunited with his wife, Jacqueline Tenorio.

Japan Presses Banks to Give Koreans Time

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Dec. 26

 BODY:
Japan's Finance Ministry and central bank are putting pressure on commercial banks to support the latest international rescue effort for South Korea by extending loans as they come due next week.
Financial analysts here indicated on Thursday that they expected most Japanese banks to indeed roll over their existing loans to the Koreans, and their apparent willingness to do so increased the chances that an expedited rescue package would succeed for now. 
 Japanese banks are the biggest lenders to South Korea, with what is believed to be more than $23 billion outstanding to Korean borrowers -- nearly $14 billion of that due within a year. But the Japanese are also being pushed to the wall by their own financial crisis, and any concessions to South Korea could aggravate the banks' problems here.
With the Koreans thought by many to be close to default, the United States, Japan and other big industrial nations agreed on Wednesday to speed $10 billion to Seoul on an emergency basis in the next few weeks, besides urging commercial banks to ease their credit demands.
The new pledges came after a $57 billion rescue package led by the International Monetary Fund early this month seemed to prove inadequate in stopping the Korean financial hemorrhaging. Officials in Washington and Tokyo are concerned that defaults by South Korea could provoke world repercussions and conceivably spread Asian financial crises.
In Seoul today, the value of the Korean currency, the won, soared nearly 22 percent against the dollar, its largest one-day gain, with the advance attributed to the faster rescue effort. Around midday, the won traded at 1,505 to the dollar, compared with 1,836 late Wednesday.
Despite the tentative optimism, a few Japanese banks may be inclined to call in some loans because they are trying hard to pare exposure to South Korea as a step toward cleaning up their own balance sheets.
Most Japanese banks reached this morning would not comment on their plans, though some said they were evaluating their Korean lending.
Haruhiko Kimura, a Sanwa Bank spokesman, said: "In general, if there is a possibility of default, we have a responsibility to collect the loan because we have a responsibility to our stockholders and our depositors. So we can't just easily decide on the rollover or something like that without any assurance."
Loans to South Korean institutions make up only a small part of the overall assets of Japanese banks, which have a combined $217 billion in bad debt, according to latest official figures from the Finance Ministry. So the banks would not likely be crippled by their Korean exposure, even if all those loans were to go into default.
But the Japanese banks have been under extreme pressure to trim assets -- potential bad debts, in particular -- to meet capital-adequacy requirements and stricter banking codes soon to take effect.
Moreover, there is concern that the stock market here is so jittery about the potential for bank insolvencies that if Korean borrowers defaulted on loans, this could lead to greater instability in the Japanese securities markets.
"It will be another hit," said a Japanese financier, speaking on condition of anonymity, of the prospect of South Korean defaults.
The Korean central bank governor, Lee Kyung Sik, met this week with his Japanese counterpart, Yasuo Matsushita; Vice Finance Minister Eisuke Sakakibara, and several Japanese bank executives in an effort to persuade them to extend loans. In return, Mr. Matsushita expressed "strong expectations Japanese banks will roll over their loans on a voluntary basis," said Takashi Anzai, executive director of the central bank here.
The pressure on the banks from Mr. Sakakibara and Mr. Matsushita followed similar efforts by United States officials, who met with executives of six big American banks on Wednesday in New York.
"We don't think they need the money actually," a Japanese central bank official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "They are not in such a desperate position to use it, but this is to show our cooperative spirit."
South Korean banks and companies, however, certainly do seem to need cash quickly. Auto plants have halted production, and exports are stalled, with most transactions needing to be done on a cash basis.

Asia Aftershocks in U.S. Showrooms

BYLINE: By NOELLE KNOX

 BODY:
WANDERING the Kia or Hyundai showrooms at the Plaza Auto Mall in Brooklyn, a potential buyer sees no signs that the Korean auto industry is being shaken to its foundations. Sales in the United States are growing and so are cash payments from manufacturers to dealers to pump up sales.
"You can get up to $3,000 off a Kia Sephia, which makes it about the most affordable car in America, for around $8,000," said John Bruno, vice president and general manager of Plaza, which is in Brooklyn's Midwood section. 
 But it may not be long before American car shoppers start seeing some effects from the Korean financial crisis. Last week, the Hyundai Motor Company dismissed 31 people, or 7 percent of the staff at its American headquarters in California, including the vice president of product planning. The Daewoo Corporation, South Korea's third-largest auto maker, canceled its plans for an American debut next week at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, stirring speculation that the company will again postpone its entry -- for the sixth time -- into the United States market. And then there is Kia -- bankrupt, under control of the Korean Government and a likely takeover target.
The crisis that has consumed the South Korea economy has caused turmoil at most of the nation's leading companies, and the four domestic auto makers are no exception. With thousands of Koreans suddenly out of work and interest rates soaring, the country's auto sales are expected to drop 10 percent next year. The auto industry, already burdened by excess capacity at its plants, is staggering under the weight of huge loans.
"This is going to put them years behind where they wanted to be," said Michael L. Schmall, managing partner for the Planning Edge, a firm in Troy, Mich., that does consulting for auto companies.
The Korean auto makers, while still a relatively small force in the United States, had grand plans of becoming big global competitors. Hyundai, Daewoo, Kia and Samsung all borrowed heavily over the last 10 years to expand production and turn South Korea into the world's fourth-largest automobile market, behind North America, Western Europe and Japan.
Corporate bravado and Government subsidies built a national auto industry with three times as much plant capacity as the country needs. Today, the Koreans are capable of building more than 4 million cars and trucks a year, while domestic demand can sop up only 1.6 million vehicles. In 1996, Korean car exports totaled just 1.1 million.
"They never realized there would be a downturn," said Richard J. Pyo, an auto industry analyst in Seoul for Credit Suisse First Boston. "Now we're sitting on huge capacity and not enough domestic demand."
With Korean sales sagging and plants running at 80 percent of capacity, the auto makers are finding it harder and harder to pay interest on their loans. Eight industrial conglomerates, including Kia, have collapsed; the Korean currency has lost half its value, and the Government is seeking the largest international bailout in history.
So risky is the financial health of Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung that on Monday Moody's Investors Service lowered their credit ratings to junk-bond status, making it difficult and expensive for them to borrow more.
The weakness of the Korean auto makers and parts suppliers has started a wave of mergers and acquisitions. Among the first deals, Daewoo snapped up the Ssangyong Motor Company (pronounced sang-YOUNG), a deeply indebted maker of sport utility vehicles.
Last week, John F. Smith Jr., chairman of the General Motors Corporation, told a small group of shareholders that he expected only Hyundai and Daewoo to survive, leaving Kia and Samsung to collapse or be sold. Mr. Smith said he had sent a team to Korea to scout for ailing auto parts companies to buy.
The Ford Motor Company is also watching Korean developments closely, partly because Ford and its Japanese affiliate, the Mazda Motor Corporation, already own about 15 percent of Kia. Ford's chairman, Alexander Trotman, said recently that he was interested in increasing Ford's stake. But some industry analysts say the Korean Government is unlikely to give Ford or any other foreign company control over an auto maker. Instead, these analysts speculate that Kia will eventually be sold to Samsung.
By acquiring Korean auto makers, American companies may be able to gain better access to the highly protected Korean market, and build cars with cheaper parts. The Clinton Administration is also trying to force the Korean Government to open its borders to American products by tacking free-trade conditions to its share of the International Monetary Fund's $57 billion loan package.
"Obviously, we want them to open their markets," said Andrew H. Card Jr., president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, a lobbying group for U.S. car makers. Mr. Card asked the Clinton Administration last summer to impose sanctions on South Korea for failing to comply with an automotive trade agreement signed by the two countries in 1995. "They should comply with that agreement whether there's an I.M.F. loan or not," Mr. Card said.
The fall in the value of the won, however, has worsened the situation by making imports from the United States more expensive. Last month, Ford, G.M. and Chrysler sold a total of just 268 vehicles in Korea, their worst showing in a year.
But for American consumers, the crisis may provide some good news. Trade officials are bracing for a flood of cheaper Hyundai Accents and Sonatas and Kia Sephias. Kia's United States sales jumped 74 percent in November, and Hyundai's rose 4 percent from a year earlier. While both companies say they have no plans to cut prices immediately, they are giving dealers larger incentives to help sell more vehicles.
"Kia's operations in America are crucial to the success of Kia Motors Corporation," said Geno Effler, a spokesman for Kia's American subsidiary, which is based in Irvine, Calif. "Right now we account for 25 percent of their exports. We are the No. 1 export market for Kia. I think there's a lot of room for us to grow."
Kia, which entered the United States market in 1993, opened 100 dealerships this year, including a total of 32 in New York, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut. The company plans to sign up another 200 dealers in New England and the Midwest in 1998.
For Hyundai, higher sales volume is just what the company needs. American sales have stagnated for five years.
"Our operations are running at a loss," said Christopher L. Hosford, a spokesman for Hyundai's American subsidiary, based in Fountain Valley, Calif.
Part of the problem in the United States is that many consumers are not familiar with the products of Kia and Hyundai -- or worse, have bad memories of Hyundai's dreadful quality problems of a decade ago. The two companies' United States sales are expected to total about 160,000 this year, with Hyundai accounting for two-thirds of those.
"I don't know the public is really aware" of the companies' troubles in Korea, said Mr. Bruno, general manager of the Plaza Auto Mall, which sells both Korean brands. But he said he was not worried about his dealership. "These takeovers happen all the time. It's just part of business in general."
He added, "I think Korean car companies are going to be around a long time."

Silicon Alley on the Road

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
Like a startup hunting for cash, Silicon Alley, Manhattan's new-media district, will take a roadshow to Silicon Valley in California, or close to it, on March 16 and 17 for a conference intended to link West Coast investors with promising Internet entrepreneurs.
The conference, in San Francisco, is called "The Alley to the Valley," and it is sponsored by the city's Economic Development Corporation, the Information Industry Association and The Alleycat News, a newsletter for the Internet industry in the New York metropolitan region. At the conference, 24 New York companies are scheduled to present business plans. 
 "There is a natural fit between the Alley and the Valley," the publisher of The Alleycat News, Janet Stites, said."Many smaller New York area companies are seeking investors with resources and specific experience in technology, many of which are on the West Coast. Conversely, West Coast investors are looking outside of their region for high-impact investment opportunities."
Other sponsors include L. M. Ericsson A.B., KPMG Peat Marwick, Middleberg & Associates, the law firm of Morrison & Foerster L.L.P., Nationsbank Montgomery Securities Inc., the Nasdaq Stock Market, Prospect Street Ventures and the Silicon Valley Bank. NICK RAVO

HEADLINE: Giuliani Lashes Out at Critics of Traffic Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Those who dislike Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's new plan to barricade pedestrians from several intersections in midtown Manhattan might want to avoid crossing his path for the next few weeks.
Departing from his customarily expansive holiday mood, the Mayor unleashed a barrage of withering sarcasm yesterday on critics of the plan to hasten automobile traffic that has had to sit idling while throngs of tourists and city residents cross the street. Opponents of the plan are "anticar" and have become "hysterical" about an experiment still in its infancy, he said. 
 "It's only been two days," he said. "It's only been two days. People thought that the whole situation with removing squeegee operators and aggressive panhandlers wouldn't work also. I remember that, four years to the day. And they were all certain it wouldn't work, and I would have to cancel it in a week or two weeks."
Under the new traffic pattern, pedestrians will not be allowed to cross north-south avenues at 10 intersections on 49th and 50th Streets in midtown, where holiday foot traffic has been the heaviest. To allow motor vehicles to turn without yielding to walkers, the Police Department is setting up large barricades manned with police officers, who instruct pedestrians to cross an adjacent street before crossing an avenue.
The traffic pattern began Tuesday, but, apparently anticipating criticism, the city did not announce it until a day later. It will last until Jan. 5, when the Police Department will evaluate how well it worked before deciding whether to continue it.
The plan was suspended yesterday because of pedestrian crowds and light holiday traffic, but is to resume today, said Officer Olga Mercado, a police spokeswoman.
Although drivers like the restrictions, pedestrians have assailed them as a surrender to the dark forces of petroleum. Advocates of mass transit and foot power have been particularly upset about the move, laced as it is with symbolic implications about who is winning a primal New York contest.
The Mayor has for four years demonstrated a famously low tolerance for criticism of his initiatives, and yesterday he seemed exasperated that so many people had run down the idea, which originated with the Police Department.
"I think instead of being cynical critics immediately, they should give this plan a chance to work," he said. "It's a pilot program. Don't get so frightened by it. It's really amazing. There are these people that, when any change happens, they immediately become hysterical about it. 'Oh my God, this is going to happen; that's going to happen.' "
Those people should get used to the idea that cars are here to stay, he said, and are essential to Manhattan's economic vitality. The "new spirit of New York," he said, is to try something innovative and see if it works. "If it doesn't work, we quietly slip away from it, and try something else," he said.
The Mayor's comments were made at a news conference held just after his annual visit to Merrill Lynch's Christmas Calls program, which allows senior citizens from around the city to make free long-distance calls to friends and relatives worldwide.
It was a typically mercurial performance by Mr. Giuliani, ranging widely across the various moods he displays in public.
He began by sorrowfully announcing the death of a girl, whose parents are police officers, in a Queens house fire. Then he puckishly described the various ties and games he gave and received for Christmas after attending midnight Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral with his wife, Donna Hanover, and their two children -- one of the few public appearances he has made in recent months with his entire family. (One of the gifts he received was a computer game simulating the Battle of Gettysburg.)
He then showed a little invective on the subject of pedestrian traffic, and got in a few digs at his two predecessors in office, who will not attend his inauguration next week.
He ended the event with a warm tribute to Pope John Paul II, whom he praised for acknowledging the roots of Christianity within Judaism in a holiday homily.
"He understands the religion he presides over is derived from Judaism," Mr. Giuliani said. "Giving that demonstration and that sense of unity is a wonderful thing, and hopefully it will help to bridge some of the other gaps that were there."

HEADLINE: Big Gift for a Small-Town Library

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: DAMARISCOTTA, Me., Dec. 20

 BODY:
When she closes her eyes, Barbara Cooney sees the library of her dreams: the yard in front of the sturdy white clapboard building with black wooden shutters is a garden with lilac bushes and an apple tree whose blossoms occasionally fall on a reader's open book.
Inside children read at pint-sized desks and experiment on computers while the literary club discusses Tolstoy upstairs and visitors on the main floor leaf through genealogy books or sit in overstuffed chairs reading the history of this town, 50 miles up the coast from Portland. 
 A wealthy longtime resident of Maine and an award-winning author of 109 children's books, Ms. Cooney acknowledges that she has always been a dreamer. But at the age of 81, she decided that she could no longer wait for Damariscotta's 2,000 residents to scrape together the $2 million needed to make her dream come true. So she has donated $550,000, the largest gift in the town's history, on condition that the town raise at least $250,000 to help build a new library.
While Ms. Cooney has given generously to colleges and other causes, she has abandoned her preference for quiet giving in this case to encourage others to support their public libraries. Many Americans do not realize, she said in her crisp, emphatic style, that such contributions are tax deductible.
Ms. Cooney is not alone in favoring donations to her local library. Many of the nation's 9,000 public libraries, 90 percent of which serve populations of fewer than 50,000 people, had tough times in the early 1990's because of the recession and budget cuts by state and local governments.
But total library budgets rose by 6.4 percent in 1996, while budgets for books and other materials rose 7.1 percent, matching the 7 percent increase in 1995, according to The Library Journal, which is published by the American Library Association.
Several local libraries, moreover, have reported receiving unusually large gifts this year, often from the estates of people who were loyal users. In November, the public library in Hickory, N.C., received a $1 million gift from the family of Patrick Beaver, a 17-year-old who was killed in a boating accident this year. His father, Don, said that partly because of the library, his son had overcome a reading disorder and received straight A's.
In May, the Fairfax County Public Library in Virginia received a $1 million gift, the largest in the state's library system. The money was pledged by Orrin W. Macleod, who died of leukemia in 1994 at the age of 58. An avid reader, Mr. Macleod never went to college but wisely invested the money he received as a baggage handler and member of the ground crew of Eastern Airlines in Washington. The money is for the books-on-tape program, which he relied on after his vision became impaired.
The estate of Elinor Vidrine, a retired government worker who used material she read in the New Orleans public library to help her invest the money that quietly made her a millionaire, repaid her debt in November with a $780,000 gift. And in June, the Community Foundation of New Jersey committed $400,000 to the Montclair Public Library's capital campaign, the largest single award in its history, from an anonymous donor, who is matching every new dollar that the library raises, up to $400,000.
More than a third of all public libraries that seek public gifts have formed special units for this purpose in the last five years, said the American Library Association, which represents 57,000 public school, academic and special libraries from its headquarters in Chicago.
Thanks to Ms. Cooney's efforts, the Skidompha Public Library in Damariscotta recently bought the house next door for $300,000, and it has already raised more than $90,000 of the matching funds needed for the expansion and renovation, scheduled to begin in spring. Architects are being invited to submit competing designs. And Ms. Cooney, who had been considered an outsider because she came from Waldoboro, eight miles away, has suddenly become the town's heroine.
Ms. Cooney's rescue effort comes none too soon, said Ellen Welsh, the head librarian and another outsider, a former Bostonian who has worked at the library since 1972. The Skidompha Public Library, which grew out of a social literary club in the 1880's, has been located since 1922 in a house built in 1803.
The Skidompha, whose name is an acrostic based on the first letters of the club's original members, is cramped and deteriorated. The roof leaks; its plastered walls are peeling; and its carpet is threadbare. The card catalogue of its 30,000 books is not computerized, and its sole computer for the public broke down again recently. The seven-seat reading room is damp and drafty. So is the wing for children, built in 1974, which also has seven seats. A rickety staircase leads to the dilapidated second floor, where literary clubs still meet despite the fire marshal's edict that the area is unsafe.
Ms. Welsh said that last year was a struggle just keeping the library open six days a week for 38 hours with a staff of three, one of whom works part time, to accommodate those who made 33,800 visits.
The Skidompha, with an annual operating budget of about $90,000, received $500 from the state in 1997. Damariscotta and Newcastle, sister towns across the Damariscotta River and both served by the library, appropriated $16,790. Sales of secondhand books raised an additional $9,000. A library movie club generated $6,000. The rest came from income from the library's $200,000 nest egg, a reflection of wealthier times, and from donations to the $30,000 annual fund-raising drive.
This year, Ms. Welsh said, although town residents have generously supported the expansion project, only $24,000 has been raised for operations.
"We're not likely to make our goal this year," she said. "The romance is in giving to a new building."
The town desperately needs a bigger library. Because of its beauty, the town is growing, said Charles Ault, the chairman of Damariscotta's three selectmen, who manage the municipal affairs. For the last few years, it has been attracting people who adore the town's quaint drug store with its original soda fountain and rows of flavored colas but who are also accustomed to libraries and espresso bars like the River Cafe, which sells rugs from Turkey and Afghanistan and violins that its owner refurbishes.
As a result, Mr. Ault said, the Skidompha will probably not have much difficulty raising the $250,000 for Ms. Cooney's challenge grant or the rest.
"My bank is making a substantial contribution," he said, referring to Bath Savings, which he manages, one of five in the area.
Ms. Cooney insisted that the new library be built downtown as a condition of her donation, one of the few restrictions she placed on the gift. Another gives her "esthetic" approval of the new structure.
But she has not asked that the building be renamed in her honor, nor for any of the other public acknowledgments that are routine in the ego-driven world of philanthropy.
She said she was more than satisfied with her books, her four children and many grandchildren. Ms. Cooney, who was born in Brooklyn to wealthy parents who spent their summers in Maine, has twice won the Caldecott Medal for her children's books, which she writes and illustrates. A tiny, fit woman with wide blue eyes and a thick braid across her impeccably groomed silver-white hair, she shows no signs of slowing down.
"I think they're afraid I'll die before the project is finished," Ms. Cooney said of the library development committee, of which she is co-chairwoman. "But I'm planning on living to 100, and I usually do what I set my mind to."

HEADLINE: As Korea Faces Economic Crisis, Emigrants Feel a Sad Vindication

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Heung Choi and her husband, Eung, came to America in 1974, long before South Korea's economic miracle. Then, as they struggled and built a new life running a small bookstore in Manhattan, they saw South Korea blossom with sudden riches, and found themselves wondering about the immigrant's path they had chosen.
"In Korea, people would say, 'Immigrants are beggars,' " Mrs. Choi said. "So it became hard to say 100 percent that we made a good choice to come over here." 
 But now, as South Korea tries to dig out from a staggering crisis in its currency and economy, the tables have turned again. Although the Chois say they are full of sorrow, rage and shame about the plight of their homeland, their lives in America have suddenly taken on a new meaning. The burdens of immigrating -- and learning a new culture and language -- were not a mistake, after all.
"I am so relieved to be here," Mrs. Choi said.
The story of South Korea's economic crisis is for the most part a global tale of multinational corporations and geopolitics, but it is also an American story, intimate and personal -- and full of emotions that are far more complicated than old-fashioned sympathy.
In Korean neighborhoods in New York and across the nation, the spasm of austerity and patriotic self-denial that has gripped much of South Korea has found its mirror image in a sense of complicated, ambiguous victory.
From greengrocer workers in Manhattan to shoppers in the strip malls of Koreatown in Los Angeles, Korean-Americans said the humbling of their homeland had produced an unexpected flush of vindication -- sometimes expressed openly, sometimes only quietly, almost guiltily: A poorer South Korea makes the sacrifices of immigrants in America easier to justify.
But at the same time, many said they were tortured and distressed and ashamed at South Korea's economic humiliation, and they have thrown themselves into various local efforts to show solidarity with the austerity drive back home.
Answering an appeal by the Korean Association of New York to "send $100 home," immigrants have stood in long lines at Korean-owned banks to transfer money to relatives. Christmas parties have been canceled. The tradition of taking co-workers and clients to dinner has become muted, hurting restaurants from Flushing to Fort Lee, N.J. Store owners on Union Boulevard, the main Korean commercial strip in Flushing, say that shoppers are simply not buying.
The monetary crisis has had more direct consequences as well -- especially in areas tied to tourism, which has fallen off sharply. That has hurt restaurants, hotels and travel agencies, particularly in New York and Los Angeles, which have the two largest Korean communities in the nation.
In Los Angeles, the annual holiday influx of Koreans flying in to visit relatives -- or to continue on to the gambling tables of Las Vegas -- simply did not materialize this year. Export sales to South Korea have stalled.
"Deals that were supposed to close in recent weeks didn't," said Y. B. Kim, who heads the Korean-American Family Services Center, a social services agency based in Los Angeles. "It's almost impossible to do business with Korea at this point."
But to a greater degree, by embracing the spirit of austerity, Korean-Americans have hurt themselves.
"They're not spending money -- they're sending it home," said David Kim, the owner of Ace Golf Shop in Flushing, which was empty and silent on a recent afternoon.
The South Korean economy, meanwhile, has continued its wild ride. On Tuesday, the nation's currency, the won, hit another low against the dollar, rising slightly on Wednesday. The stock market in Seoul fell 7.5 percent on Tuesday and 4 percent more on Wednesday. (The markets were closed on Christmas Day.) Political uncertainty and speculation run rampant about what policies President-elect Kim Dae Jung will follow when he takes office in February.
Almost as unsettling, in the Koreatowns of America at least, is the seething question of blame.
Through much of the 1990's, as South Korea grew rich, immigrants began to resent the lavish spending habits of their newly affluent Korean cousins back home, and to bridle at what they said were the sometimes patronizing attitudes about the American immigrants' life and the often backbreaking work it demanded. The immigrants predicted that dire consequences would result from the profligacy and arrogance they witnessed. Now they say the crisis has proven them right, but at a terrible cost.
"In a way, I think Korean immigrants are relieved by what has happened," said Pyong Gap Min, a professor of sociology at Queens College who immigrated in the early 1970's. "They can say, 'My choice to immigrate was better.' "
"But feelings are very conflicted," he added. "On the one hand, they are relieved. On the other hand, it's their home country, so they are concerned."
Mr. Kim at the Ace Golf Shop in Flushing said he thought everything was changing -- what it meant to be Korean and to be American and how to live between those worlds. When he last visited South Korea in 1993, he said that people would meet him and say, "There's an American beggar, let's buy him a beer."
"I think a lot more Koreans might prefer the American dream now," he said.
Indeed, in many ways there are two completely different American dreams for Koreans in New York. One became familiar through the 1970's and 1980's as immigrants entered the fruit and vegetable business. Families working together through endless days in tidy shops became a symbol of immigrant success. Since 1980, the Korean-American population in the New York metropolitan area -- immigrants and their American-born children -- has doubled, to about 400,000, according to the Korean Association of New York.
Growing wealth in South Korea in the 1990's pushed a second wave of arrivals, this time with money in their pockets. At Columbia University's American Language Program, for example, which costs more $30,000 a year for an English-language immersion program, South Korea overtook Japan in the last few years as the country with the most foreign students.
The rising wealth in Asia also encouraged many South Korean companies to expand in America, but experts on the New York Korean community said that relatively little money flowed back the other way. Few Korean-Americans in New York have been hurt by, say, falling real-estate values in Seoul -- though travel agents report many would-be investors from New York flying there now to look for bargains.
At the Chois' bookstore, the economic effects are decidedly mixed. The price of books shipped by Korean publishers has fallen because of the shifts in currency exchange rates. But publishers, frantic for dollars, are demanding immediate payment on everything they ship, and that more than cancels out any benefit.
"I thought nothing would affect here," Mrs. Choi said. "But here and there is all connected, I see now. Everything is a circle."
But many attitudes and perceptions that have divided Koreans and Korean-Americans still persist. At a meeting of Korean-born and American-born Korean students arranged for a reporter at a Columbia University dormitory, one student, Brian Chang, sputtered about the "disgusting" examples of waste, like expensive cars, on which some South Korean students had spent their parents' money.
"In some ways, I think Korea got too rich too fast and couldn't handle the responsibility," said Mr. Chang, the son of Korean immigrants, who is studying engineering management. Then he hastened to apologize to Korean-born friends in the room who, he stressed, were not at all like that.
Ivy Kim is not so apologetic.
"The foreign students, they need this knock in the head," said Ms. Kim, a 23-year-old clerk in her mother's clothing store in Flushing, which is called Rainbow Fashion. But she is also not without compassion. One of her best friends, she said, is a foreign student -- a senior at the New York Institute of Technology, who was one semester from graduation when the crisis in South Korea struck.
Ms. Kim has been trying to talk her friend into living with her in Queens, saving the $1,500 a month in Manhattan rent she is paying now, and finishing her degree. The only other alternative for her friend, Ms. Kim said, is to return to Korea immediately. Though her friend's family is still sending money, it doesn't go far enough now to pay the bills.
Some students, from both wealthy and more humble circumstances, have already left, or decided that they cannot stay.
Eunsook Jee, a 22-year-old college student with a shy smile and clunky black-framed glasses, came to America last spring with no greater ambition than to learn English. She took a job in a Korean restaurant by night and studied English by day at Queens College. But her family has told her she must return home, three months early, and this week she sat in a travel agent's office in Flushing, checking prices.
The reasons are at least partly financial, Ms. Jee said, especially the nearly doubled cost of her expenses in America. But perhaps from pride, or to save face, her parents have offered another explanation as well, she said.
"They say they miss me," Ms. Jee said.
Mrs. Choi, at the bookstore, said the crisis reinforced her belief that dependable, solid looking surfaces can lie.
"We thought we were doing so well,' she said. "Now all of sudden, for nothing, there is no money in the bank -- we don't know how these things happen," she said, referring to the South Korean economy. "I feel so, so, embarrassed, and so annoyed -- very mixed."

A full year's tuition is $12,693; the $30,000 figure represented not only tuition but also room and board.

He and other Korean-American and Korean students at Columbia University talked about South Korea's problems. Heung Choi and her husband, Eung Choi, immigrated in 1974 and run a Korean bookstore in Manhattan. "I am so relieved to be here," she said. "They're not spending money -- they're sending it home," said David Kim, in his Queens golf shop. (Photographs by Chang W. Lee/The New York Times)(pg. B6)

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
In Quiet Session, Dollar Rises Against Yen but Dips vs. Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the yen yesterday amid mounting worries about the Japanese economy and fears of a brewing credit shortage.
The dollar slipped against the German mark in thin trading volume in a quiet post-Christmas holiday session. 
 Many European markets, particularly in London -- the chief foreign-exchange center -- were closed yesterday. And currency traders in New York wrapped up business soon after the early closing of the Treasury and currency futures markets.
The dollar settled in New York at 130.41 yen, up from 129.85 yen on Wednesday. The dollar was also quoted at 1.7725 marks, down from 1.7735 marks. And the pound rose to $1.6779 from $1.6703, its highest level against the dollar since Nov. 24. Markets in the United States and Europe and some Asian markets were closed on Thursday for Christmas.
The dollar rose against the yen after a sharp drop in Japanese stocks. The Nikkei index of 225 issues tumbled 3.25 percent yesterday, ending below the psychologically important 15,000-point level.
"The Nikkei below 14,000 is going to be very scary," said Chris Melendez, senior dealer at Sanwa Bank California. "Some banks will no longer be able to meet the Bank of International Settlements' capital adequacy minimums."
Japanese regulations allow banks to hold part of their capitalization in equities. At the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31, Japanese banks must show on their books the diminished value of their holdings of equities. The Asian financial crisis has put Japanese banks on heightened guard against extending risky loans, resulting in a brewing credit shortage, analysts said.
In other bearish news, Japan's retail sales were reported down 4.7 percent in November, compared with figures from the month a year earlier, for the eighth consecutive monthly decline.
Traders expected the focus on the dollar-yen exchange rate to intensify next week as the market remained divided between hopes of dollar strength and fears of further Bank of Japan intervention. The Bank of Japan intervened last week, selling $10 billion in dollars to prop up the yen after it slumped to a 67-month low against the dollar.

Venezuelan Growth Put at 5.1% in 1997

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 26

 BODY:
Venezuela's economy grew 5.1 percent this year, fueled by an expansion of the oil sector and increases in consumer spending and foreign investment, the Government said today.
The robust growth followed the contraction of the economy last year after President Rafael Caldera imposed austerity measures to foster free markets. 
 Much of the 1997 expansion was a result of an 8.8 percent gain in the oil sector, the central bank's president, Antonio Casas Gonzalez, said.
Venezuela, the main foreign supplier of oil to the United States, increased its daily oil exports by some 300,000 barrels, to 3.065 million barrels a day in 1997, the central bank said. That put it well over its quota of 2.583 million barrels a day in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
For the first time in two decades, the Government has decided to allow foreign companies to invest in Venezuela's state-controlled oil sector.
Preliminary figures show that direct foreign investment reached $4.346 billion this year, mostly directed toward the oil sector and the privatization of state-run banks, Mr. Casas said. Direct foreign investment in 1996 was $1.575 billion.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Move Higher, Helped by Slow Holiday Sales

BYLINE: By Bridge News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended slightly higher yesterday in very light trading.
Talk of disappointing holiday retail sales and the dollar's advance against the Japanese yen helped bonds yesterday, but traders said the moves were meaningless because they occurred on such thin trading volume. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 5/32 , to 103 5/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, slipped to 5.90 percent from 5.91 percent on Wednesday. The Treasury market was closed on Thursday for Christmas, and it closed early yesterday as it did on Wednesday.
About $14.8 billion of securities changed hands yesterday, about one-fifth of the volume during normal trading sessions, according to the GovPx bond pricing service.
Prices moved lower during the Asian trading session, where there was reportedly some foreign selling. Many European markets were closed yesterday, and trading in New York got off to a slow start.
Late in the morning, prices began to do a little better, and Charles Reinhard, a market strategist at the ABN-Amro Chicago Corporation, said the activity showed that traders were still interested in buying on dips.
He said another factor might have been the newspaper reports yesterday that holiday sales had failed to meet retailers' expectations for the third consecutive year, and he said the dollar's gains against the yen might have played a role as well.
The Treasury market will turn its attention next week to the December survey from the National Association of Purchasing Management on Friday. Traders will watch Wednesday's December report from the Chicago purchasing managers for clues to the national survey.
Analysts are expecting a slightly weaker December national purchasing managers' reading at 53.9, compared with 54.4 in November. The report's reading on new export orders could give some sense of how much impact Asia's problems have had on United States economic activity.

HEADLINE: Outlook Is Mixed for Orange County

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., Dec. 26

 BODY:
The recent upgrading of Orange County's credit rating was good news for the county, which filed for bankruptcy three years ago, but the move will not cure its immediate financing problems.
County officials and bond industry experts say the strengthened rating represents an important step that along with other improvements, could result in more money for county projects in two or three years. 
 In the meantime, however, everything from jail construction to property maintenance remains on hold because of the financial collapse.
Moody's Investors Service said last week that the county had made enough progress with its finances since the December 1994 bankruptcy to earn "investment grade" ratings on most of its bonds.
Since the bankruptcy, the county's debt had carried "junk bond" status.
The improved rating means the county will be able to borrow without the inflated interest and insurance costs it now must pay.
The county is in the process of drawing up a comprehensive long-term financial plan that tries to forecast future county income and expenses, as well as project the costs of 30 high-priority projects.

HEADLINE: Flawed Day-Care Plans

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is drawing up plans to increase day-care subsidies for working parents as a central element of next year's domestic agenda. The goal is worthy, but only if the subsidies are directed where needed -- to low-income families.
The Administration no doubt agrees, but it is trapped by a Republican leadership that has no intention of going along. So the White House is thinking of including a tax cut for working parents. The cut would direct very little relief to the truly needy, but the Administration hopes that it will help sell more worthwhile parts of the package. This is a risky strategy because it invites the G.O.P. to pile on tax cuts of its own, forcing Congress to trim other domestic spending programs. 
 Day-care subsidies help low-wage workers keep more of what they earn and help parents place children in the best environment. Many low-wage parents ask relatives to care for children, often with unsatisfactory results. Targeted subsidies would allow them to purchase better day care.
The Administration is also considering increased grants to states, more money for after-school programs, model day-care centers and training for day-care workers. These are useful ideas. The tax cuts are not. One would cut taxes for corporations that create day-care centers -- despite the fact that many corporations are already creating centers, without any nudge from Washington, as a recruiting device in a tight labor market.
The other would expand a provision in the current tax code that provides up to $1,400 in tax credits for day-care expenses for a family with two or more children. But few families collect anywhere near the maximum benefit because most of them are too poor to owe much tax in the first place. The expanded tax credit would mainly help families earning $30,000 or more a year.
The bigger danger is that the White House will inadvertently create a launching pad for more tax cuts. The cuts could conceivably be paid for by temporary surplus revenues that flow from a hot economy. But when the economy slows, Congress is far more likely to cut already strained discretionary programs that are essential to poor families than it is to eliminate the new tax breaks.

Euro to Ignite Merger Boom, Analysts Say

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Even European multinational companies do not quite grasp what is coming -- but the creation of a common European currency just over a year from now, analysts say, will set the stage for a wave of consolidations in banking and industry over much of the Continent.
Eleven of the European Union's 15 members are expected to adopt the euro on Jan. 1, 1999, establishing a single-currency economic zone with more than 280 million people, slightly more than the United States, and a gross product of $6.7 trillion, rivaling the more than $7 trillion economy of the United States. 
 With national currencies expected to be transformed into fractions of the euro, banks and corporations in the monetary bloc will be able to make acquisitions, sell subsidiaries and initiate other financial transactions free of European exchange-rate risks, in the way that American companies now do throughout the 50 states.
Monetary union is expected to result in broader and more liquid capital markets, with the prices of stocks and bonds all denominated in euros. It is likely to push interest rates generally lower over the longer term, according to participants at a series of recent conferences in Manhattan on the monetary future of Europe.
The result, analysts say, is likely to be a cross-border merger spree. The 270 or so banks in European Union countries could eventually consolidate into "five or six major players, like in New York," said Philippe Ithurbide, chief economist of the capital markets division of the French bank Societe Generale.
Mr. Ithurbide, speaking at a conference organized by Niche Systems Inc., a software company that helps computers function in euros, predicted that a boom in mergers and acquisitions would also reduce the number of small and medium-sized publicly traded companies in European Union nations to roughly 350 from about 1,200 today.
"Europe has too many small caps at present because the market is fragmented and opaque," he said, referring to public companies with relatively small market values. "A single currency will end that and promote a wave of consolidations. U.S. investment will also increase, and that will promote consolidation, too."
The new euro zone is also expected to be a more competitive place, with the emerging mega-banks ruthlessly trimming back inefficient operations, some believe. Patrick Poncelet, an executive with the Swift clearing system of Brussels, which handles $3 billion worth of cross-border financial transactions daily, predicted that an "overbanked banking sector" in Europe would shrink by 30 percent over the next five years.
"The euro will have a dramatic effect on banking and cross-border transfers, increasing competition and accelerating consolidation," Mr. Poncelet said at a symposium organized by the New York Law School.
For all the impact the euro is likely to have on their operations, most European businesses are surprisingly unprepared for its debut, according to Gonzalo Perez-Piaggio, an economist at KPMG Management Consulting in London. A KPMG survey of the 300 largest European companies, he told the New York Law School conference, found that "just 2 percent were fully prepared, while fully two-thirds had no idea what its introduction would cost them."
Eleven nations -- Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Ireland, Finland, Austria and Portugal -- plan to join the new monetary system on New Year's Day, 1999.
Three others -- Britain, Sweden and Denmark -- have opted out of the early stages, and Greece has been excluded for failing to meet the economic and financial criteria for membership.
Paris and Frankfurt are expected to emerge as the financial capitals of the new Europe. But the Bank of England believes that London's status as a world financial center will assure it most of the international business in euro dealings.
"Increased euro activity in Paris and Frankfurt means more activity in London, which will be the euro's interface with the world," Len Berkowitz, the Bank of England's legal adviser, told the New York Law School meeting. "London likes deep, liquid markets and sees the euro as an opportunity, not a threat."
While monetary union is expected to bolster the region's economies, business casualties are likely, as well. Foreign-exchange dealers will be the first, in Mr. Poncelet's view. With the need to trade French francs for German marks or Italian lira for Spanish pesetas disappearing, he predicted that banks across Europe would lose $5 billion in commissions and trading profit from 1999 to 2004.
"Paris and Madrid will be worst hit because half their trading volume is in vanishing currencies," he added.
But at the Niche Systems conference, Neal George, chief economist at the Mercantile Bank of St. Louis, forecast that banks would make up lost currency profits with fees from the expected wave of mergers.
"Deal makers will do well during the euro's early years," he said.
A single currency will also make it harder for multinational companies to charge different prices in national markets. Mr. Perez-Piaggio of KPMG said that pharmaceutical producers would be particularly squeezed because their prices commonly varied by as much as 60 percent among national markets. Catalogue retailers may do well, however, since the single currency will make their prices easily comparable with local shops throughout Europe.
The big unanswered question is how the euro will fare against the dollar. Because of the expected strong influence of Germany in a new European central bank that will control monetary policy, some analysts believe that the euro will be a strong currency.
Others, though, noting the likely entry of traditionally high-inflation southern European countries like Italy and Spain, worry that the euro could flounder.
Such disparate forecasts were on display at a conference sponsored by the Brussels-based European Finance Convention Foundation. David L. Abramson, an economist at the Bank Credit Analyst Research Group in Montreal, said the euro needed to be "weak but not soft" to avoid increasing unemployment and stimulating protectionism.
And he warned that the value of the United States dollar could plunge against the euro if the new central bank quickly sold a lot of its excess dollars.
At the same conference, Prof. Peter Kenan of Princeton University predicted that the European central bank would act decisively to create a strong euro in order to establish its credibility. He stressed that the bank would be run exclusively by people who now occupy positions of authority in European central banks, and noted that the governors of the southern European central banks, who will sit on its council, were all "anti-inflation hawks."
At the New York conferences, there was broad agreement that the euro would only gradually challenge the dollar's role as the world reserve and invoicing currency.
"There will be great inertia here," predicted Jean-Pierre Patat, general manager of the foreign department of the Bank of France. Dollar markets, he added, will seem "safer and more homogeneous" for a long time.
Then there is the question of what happens to contracts written in currencies that are to disappear. European legislation already makes them enforceable in euros, and laws being enacted in New York State, Illinois and California should cover more than 90 percent of financial dealings between the European single-currency countries and the United States.
"I think U.S. courts will see the euro as the replacement for vanished currencies and uphold contracts written in them," said Daniel P. Cunningham, a partner at the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore.
Of course, the repercussions of European monetary union will not be known until after the 1999 startup. The only near-certainty, said Sydney M. Cone, a professor at New York Law School and the organizer of the conference there, is that a single currency is coming to Europe after decades of hoping and planning.
"It is going to happen," Professor Cone said. "We don't know all the consequences. But we can at least alert the business, financial and legal communities to what it might imply."

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 19.18, to 7,679.31, As Gains in Korea Spill Over

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
An overnight rally in South Korea's ravaged stocks contributed to mild gains in the United States stock market yesterday, but many investors stayed away from a shortened post-Christmas trading session that was the slowest of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 19.18 points, or a quarter of 1 percent, at 7,679.31, narrowing its loss for the week to 76.98 points.
In the broader market, advancing issues led decliners by 1,470 to 1,220. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 154.9 million shares in a trading session that ended three hours early at 1 P.M. It was the slowest day in 1997, falling below the previous low of 189.70 million shares set on Nov. 28, the day after Thanksgiving. 
 "The overseas markets, particularly in Korea, had a reasonably good night, and that provided us with the impetus to rally at the open," said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. "But nothing came out of our own market to sustain it."
There was no economic news, and many traders were still away for a long Christmas weekend.
"The market has found its footing here on the lower side," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. Nonetheless, he said, "I don't think you can read too much into today's action."
South Korea's main stock index rose 6.74 percent yesterday as investors concluded the worst of the financial crisis may have passed with word that economic assistance from the International Monetary Fund would be accelerated.
American depository receipts of Asian stocks traded higher in New York as Seoul's optimism spilled over. Korea Electric Power gained 1 1/16 , to 11 1/4.
Stocks also were buoyed by a rebound in technology stocks. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 11.85 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,511.38.
Microsoft, which tumbled to a six-month low on Wednesday, regained some ground. The stock, which topped the most-active list on the Nasdaq, rose 1 13/16 , to 120 3/4.
The Dow average was bolstered by I.B.M.'s gain of 2 9/16 , to end at 101 11/16 . A rebound in shares of Merck, another Dow component, also helped. The big pharmaceutical company's shares rose 2 1/4, to end at 103 1/2.
Big bank stocks also rose as worries over their earnings exposure to South Korea eased. Citicorp was up 1 9/16 , to 121 15/16 . Chase Manhattan Bank was up 2 5/16 , to 106 11/16 , and BankAmericaclimbed 1 9/16 , to 70 13/16.

Jockeying For Position In South Korea

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
About a dozen of the country's most influential commercial and investment banks will huddle with Federal Reserve officials in New York on Monday morning, discussing ways to shore up South Korea's ailing borrowers.
United States lenders, as well as their counterparts in Europe and Japan, are being pressured by regulators to roll over problem loans until the South Korean economy stabilizes. But what if the economy does not stabilize? 
 Despite the emotional relief that has accompanied the South Korean bailout, there are strong signs that financiers and diplomats are still extremely anxious about the fate of the country and they are scrambling to avoid what will certainly become a series of more serious financial measures should the South Korean economy continue to stall.
Although the South Korean stock market rebounded about 7 percent yesterday after steep declines the previous two days, many analysts say the economic crisis is still in its infancy. Japan, which remains an economic wild card, was battered by a 3.25 percent stock market drop yesterday. And the grim financial statistics from South Korea suggesting the possibility of corporate defaults soon may take on a more human face -- one scarred by layoffs and personal bankruptcies.
To stanch the hemorrhaging, the International Monetary Fund and other institutions have devised a $10 billion rescue package to be delivered to South Korea in early 1998.
Amid the rescue effort, American companies, while not the biggest creditors in Southeast Asia, appear to be positioning themselves in a show of support for the region's long-term prospects -- and in the process snap up some corporate bargains.
The Chase Manhattan Corporation, the General Electric Company, the General Motors Corporation, and J. P. Morgan & Company are all said to be looking at ailing companies in the region, while Merrill Lynch & Company has confirmed that it plans to take over 50 branches of the Japanese brokerage firm Yamaichi Securities. Chase, G.E., G.M., and J. P. Morgan all declined to comment on the speculation.
Monday's Fed meeting will be followed by a more broadly attended gathering of financial institutions later in the day at J. P. Morgan. The second meeting will not include regulators. Both meetings are expected to produce some sort of additional private financing for South Korea, and it is clear from the list of companies involved in the meetings that it is no longer only banks that are being asked to ante up.
The invitation list for the Fed meeting originally included only commercial banking giants like Chase, Citicorp, BankAmerica, J. P. Morgan, the Bankers Trust New York Corporation and the Bank of New York Corporation. It has now grown to include some of the country's largest investment banks as well. Invitees include Goldman, Sachs & Company and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., which have been hired as financial advisers to the South Korean Government and are said by bankers to be leading candidates to underwrite a planned $9 billion debt offering by South Korea early next year, as well as Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company.
If any of this hurried financial maneuvering by the I.M.F. and the financial giants fails to stop the hemorrhaging in South Korea, financiers and politicians are considering the possibility of repackaging all of the country's bad debt -- both public and private -- as sovereign debt guaranteed by the South Korean Government, according to bankers and American officials close to the talks.
The amount of debt that would have to be consolidated in South Korea is hard to pin down, but there is no question that the number is enormous and would be far larger than any comparable amount of bad debt that was amassed in a single Latin American country during that region's lending crisis a decade ago. South Korea's short-term external debt as of mid-December may have stood at about $60 billion, according to a recent report by the Institute of International Finance, a trade group representing hundreds of the world's largest financial institutions.
Another issue presented by consolidating all of the bad debt is the impact it would have on the balance sheets of lenders. American banks, for example, have noted that their exposure to South Korea is relatively limited and far less than that of the Japanese. Banks, however, engage in significant amounts of so-called "off-balance sheet" financing in South Korea that are not completely captured in their public filings. These include such products as interest-rate and currency swaps, and other derivatives. If South Korea's debt is consolidated, those figures would have to be disclosed and the level of off-balance sheet activity would quickly become apparent.
"It wouldn't surprise me at all to find the overall exposure to a catastrophic event in South Korea is greater than the banks have disclosed, but I don't think it's anything on the order of magnitude of what occurred in the 1980's in Latin America," said Diane Glossman, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc.

Fire Sale to Foreigners Expected in South Korea
Already humbled by an international bailout, South Korea is now confronting another serious blow to its national pride: the prospect that American and other foreign companies will snap up valuable domestic companies that took generations to build. 
 The nation's weakened stock market and currency, combined with eased rules for foreign ownership, are making many South Korean businesses extremely attractive takeover candidates. Even the singer Michael Jackson is getting into the act, negotiating to buy a ski resort from a bankrupt South Korean underwear maker. Page A1.
 
Mild Post-Christmas Rally in Stocks
The stock market ended higher in the slowest trading of the year, with prices helped by overnight gains in the South Korean market and a rebound in some technology stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.18 points, or 0.25 percent, to 7679.31, narrowing its weekly loss to 76.98 points. D10.
 
Dollar Rises vs. Yen on Japan Fears
Anxiety about the consequences of a credit shortage in Japan and broader fears about the Japanese economy helped the dollar rally back above 130 yen yesterday, but the dollar slipped against the mark. D11.
 
Japan's jobless rolls swelled by 160,000 people in November to 2.28 million, the biggest jump since July 1996 and the seventh consecutive increase, leaving the overall unemployment rate stuck at a record high of 3.5 percent, the Government reported. D3.
 
Japanese Firms Punished
Daiwa and Nikko were penalized for their involvement in paying off racketeers. Regulators fined Daiwa a total of $1.46 million and Nikko $1.15 million, and the Finance Ministry suspended both from conducting some types of securities transactions for more than three months. D3.
 
Britain Unwelcome in Euro Talks
Britain's decision to keep the pound at least until 2002 has made it unwelcome at increasingly intimate discussions about European monetary union held by 11 other countries planning to meld their currencies into a single denomination, the euro, in January 1999. The British Government is not pleased that its key European trading partners are excluding it from these policy meetings. D2.
 
Bonds Strengthen in Light Dealings
Treasury bonds ended higher on talk about disappointing holiday retail sales and the dollar's advance against the yen. But trading was extremely light, and dealers did not ascribe much significance to the bond market's behavior. D10.
 
Nissan Reducing Development Time
The Nissan Motor Company, Japan's No. 2 auto maker, will spend more than $300 million to upgrade a computer-aided design system aimed at cutting costs and the amount of time it takes to develop models, from 19 months presently to 12 months. If successful Nissan would be the fastest Japanese auto maker in the design and creation of new vehicles, industry analysts said. D3.
 
Calpers May Seek Board Seats
The California Public Employees' Retirement System is drafting a policy that would allow the nation's biggest pension fund to seek board seats on corporations in which it is a major stockholder. Such a change would reflect the increasingly involved role the $127 billion pension fund has taken in recent years, particularly regarding companies it regards as underperformers. D14.
 
A Barbie Sets Off a Debate
Mattel introduced Puerto Rican Barbie as part of the company's Dolls of the World line last January, and the doll has been popular in Puerto Rico. But the doll has also caused a heated debate among Puerto Ricans in the United States, many of whom find her objectionable on several counts, from her light skin to her colonial-style dress to the history lesson on the back of the doll's box. Puerto Rican Barbie has long, wavy brown hair and coffee-colored eyes in contrast to the blue-eyed version, above, introduced by Mattel in 1959. A1.

As Market Turmoil Eases, Korea Shifts Focus to Labor

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Saturday, Dec. 27

 BODY:
With fears of imminent default receding and the markets rebounding in his nation, President-elect Kim Dae Jung turned his attention on Friday to another potentially explosive problem: labor.
Widespread layoffs look ever more inevitable, so Mr. Kim met with the nation's top labor leaders to try to persuade them to accept the increasingly grim economic reality that is settling over South Korea. In a nation with an intensely militant labor force, however, any talk of layoffs opens the door to deep uncertainty, even when options seem few. 
 "If things do not improve within the next couple of months or so, there is nothing else we can do but to cut loose redundant employees," Mr. Kim said after the meeting. "We should work together to prevent this unfortunate situation."
As a first step, aides to Mr. Kim said, new procedures will allow banks and other financial institutions to dismiss workers if needed to help expedite a merger or acquisition. Until now, South Korean banks have essentially been barred by law from dismissing workers except when bankruptcy looms or after intricate negotiations with union representatives.
Yet it remains unclear whether the drastic situation in South Korea will cause a fundamental shift in labor practices, like abandoning virtually sacrosanct job security, or will simply instill resentment among workers.
On Friday, South Korea's stock and currency markets reversed the downward spiral of recent weeks, surging in reaction to the decision late Wednesday by the United States, Japan and Europe to expedite $10 billion of emergency loans to avert possible default.
It took 1,498 South Korean won to buy a dollar on Friday, a 22.6 percent increase in the currency's value from Wednesday, when the exchange rate was 1,836 won to the dollar.
Stock prices in Seoul rose 6.7 percent, and long-term interest rates, a barometer of investor confidence and inflation fears, fell to 27 percent from 29 percent.
The stock market was flat in abbreviated trading today. The market closed up 1.16 points, or three-tenths of a percent, at 376.31.
"The mood is much better than it was two days ago," said Lee Han Ggoo, president of the Daewoo Economic Research Institute here. "We don't have to worry about the supply of foreign exchange any more, just the price."
Mr. Kim helped send the markets diving earlier this week when he expressed surprise at finding out just how serious South Korea's debt problems were, though he may have been trying to lower expectations about any quick recovery or fixing blame on his predecessor, President Kim Young Sam.
Kim Dae Jung apparently had some success convincing labor leaders that attracting foreign investment was a precondition of stabilizing the labor market.
Park In Sang, president of the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, said after the meeting that he would write letters to the International Monetary Fund and to international bankers to assure them that his unions would respect the $57 billion I.M.F. agreement to help rescue South Korea, including the requirements that Seoul loosen labor practices and open financial markets.
"Layoffs must be the last option," Mr. Park said. But he added, "Members of labor unions rely on Kim's philosophy of highly regarding a stable labor market."
Mr. Kim, who had pledged during his presidential campaign not to allow corporate layoffs, said that if layoffs had to occur in the financial sector, only later would they come to manufacturing industries.
One of his aides described the outlook more bluntly.
"We are preparing for massive layoffs at manufacturing companies as well as banks," said Chang Che Shik, who serves on an economic task force dealing with the financial emergency. "Such moves still require more discussion and some concessions by labor unions."
That is the kind of talk that seems to terrify other labor leaders, one of whom warned that grave difficulties might arise if workers were dismissed unfairly or precipitously.
"If the proper procedures are not followed, there will be problems," said Yoon Young Mo, international secretary of the Korean Coalition of Trade Unions. "It would set off a downward spiral, losing confidence. There will be wide discontent throughout our society."
Mr. Yoon estimated that of the 13 million people formally counted in the South Korean work force -- not including small, family-run businesses -- perhaps one million were likely to lose their jobs in the coming year. He said that 120,000 workers had been dismissed in the last month, though the Ministry of Labor has not officially confirmed it.
Yet he also predicted that street demonstrations, very common in South Korea in recent years, were less likely because so many people fear for their jobs, if they still have them.
"Many workers are frightened," Mr. Yoon said. "They will accept layoffs if there is a process in place that shows them there is some control. If there is not, it is hard to predict what will happen."
Mr. Kim apparently decided to set an example in his office, announcing this week that he plans to cut in half the number of personal secretaries for the president's office. Mr. Kim, who was elected last week, is scheduled to be sworn in on Feb. 25.
South Korean courts took a step toward greater strictness with the nation's financial institutions, rejecting applications from the Coryo Securities Corporation and the Dongsuh Securities Company to seek bankruptcy protection. They will probably be sold or closed instead.
The South Korean Government has promised to force insolvent finance companies out of business as part of the package arranged by the I.M.F. In the past, no Korean brokerage firm has ever been permanently closed down.

HEADLINE: Wrong Turn on City Traffic?

 BODY:
Strolling past Rockefeller Center on the day after Christmas delivers a walloping reminder about New York City. More people want to be there than the laws of time and space permit. Workers who did not qualify for a long weekend vied for control of the sidewalks with gawkers admiring the fabled Christmas tree, tourists determined to take each other's pictures in the center of the pedestrian traffic flow, a man playing "Jingle Bells" on a flute for spare change, and skateboarders trying to execute a curbside flip. Except for the skateboarders, whom we would sacrifice in a second, who is to say which claims for turf have the top priority?
Rather than throw in his lot with any of the above, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has taken the side of the motorist against them all. Earlier this week, city police blocked off crosswalks at 10 intersections of 49th and 50th Streets so that cars and trucks would find it easier to make turns. The forces of footpower instantly howled in protest. The Mayor labeled his critics "hysterical" and "anti-car." 
 A great many people in New York City are indeed anti-car, and for good reason. Most people there do not own automobiles, and rely on subways, buses and cabs. The antagonism between pedestrians and motorists is as venerable as the hatred between landlords and tenants, and as puzzling to visitors from other parts of the country. Mr. Giuliani spent his formative years on Long Island, and perhaps his perception of traffic matters still bears a suburban perspective. While defending his new policy, the Mayor launched into a lecture on the importance of the automobile in which he suggested that making life easier for private motorists was necessary to the city's economic development. But the scene yesterday along Fifth Avenue showed exactly how misguided that idea can be. One great engine of economic growth in midtown Manhattan is tourism, and the tourists come to walk the city's streets, not drive on them. When the competition between people on foot and people behind the wheel reaches a crisis point, the city's economic future may demand that the Mayor defend the sidewalk contingent, not dismiss it.
Nevertheless, there is no great harm in conducting a two-week experiment to see if closing off a few crosswalks greatly improves traffic flow during the holidays. The number of people walking near midtown tourist attractions this time of year is so high that only one or two vehicles can make a turn through the crosswalks during each light change. No one benefits if buses, cabs and delivery trucks are trapped in perpetual gridlock. Forcing pedestrians to walk out of their way to cross the street in order to ease the seasonal crush is a trade-off worth studying.
But for the Mayor to unveil what is basically an anti-pedestrian initiative, then suggest it might be duplicated in other parts of midtown and couple that with a pep talk on the rights of motorists is the wrong turn to take. No wonder what looked like a modest traffic control experiment raised an outcry.

HEADLINE: Minorities Flock to Cause Of Vouchers for Schools

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DENVER, Dec. 26

 BODY:
A new class-action lawsuit here underscores the depth of support among black and Hispanic parents nationwide for a favorite cause of the conservative movement: publicly financed vouchers to send children to private and parochial schools.
"It is only natural that African-Americans and Hispanics would sign on," said Joe Rogers, a conservative black lawyer who helped organized the lawsuit. "They are among the most affected by public education in this country." 
 Recruited at black churches and Spanish grocery stores, nearly 3,500 mothers and fathers of public school students had joined the case by the time Mr. Rogers closed the rolls of plaintiffs last month. "If we had kept going, we would have had 10,000 plaintiffs," he said.
Indeed, two national polls this year indicate that blacks favor vouchers more than whites. In a Gallup poll in the summer for Phi Delta Kappa, a professional education association, 72 percent of black respondents favored vouchers, while the general population split evenly on the issue, with 48 percent for vouchers and 48 percent against them. In a second survey, support for vouchers ranged from 65 percent of Hispanic respondents to 56 percent of blacks to 47 percent of whites. The poll was conducted in the spring for the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington research group that specializes in black issues.
"It's common sense; the poorest people want help," said Janie Perry, administrator of the Watch-Care Academy, one of two all-black private schools that opened here recently. "Minority children are the ones doing the worst in public schools. But parents have no money for alternatives."
Although court challenges are legion, voucher proposals are being prepared in about half of the nation's 50 states. The plans run the gamut from bills in state legislatures to proposals for state constitutional amendments to initiatives by local school boards.
Only a handful of voucher programs have been established. The nation's two largest, in Milwaukee and Cleveland, serve low-income, largely black and Hispanic children.
The program in Cleveland covers 3,000 children, while the Milwaukee program, launched in 1990, covers 15,000. Reading and math scores have improved for children participating in both programs. Last summer, Harvard University researchers surveyed parents of children receiving vouchers in Cleveland and reported that two-thirds were "very satisfied" with the program.
In the black community and in civil rights organizations, vouchers appear to be deepening a generational and income divide between the older, more affluent leadership and the younger, more impoverished rank and file. Last summer, for example, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People voted to oppose vouchers.
But, in the poll for the Joint Center, vouchers for private and parochial education were supported by 86 percent of black respondents between the ages of 26 and 35. In contrast, only 19 percent of blacks 65 and older supported vouchers. The greatest support for vouchers came from poor blacks -- 70 percent of those earning less that $15,000 advocate such plans. Support dwindled to about 50 percent among those making over $35,000.
Undaunted, the N.A.A.C.P., teachers' unions and Democratic politicians have led anti-voucher rallies around the nation. They argue that vouchers will drain public funds and the best students from already beleaguered public schools.
"Instead of abandoning our schools, we should continue to support proven reform efforts," President Clinton warned in September before the Senate voted to block a voucher experiment for the District of Columbia. "I will veto any legislation that damages our commitment to public education."
But some Democrats are breaking ranks. Representative Floyd Flake, a New York Democrat and member of the Congressional Black Caucus, was a vocal supporter of efforts to create a $7 million voucher program for 2,000 poor children in Washington.
Fueling some black dissatisfaction is the end of busing to promote integration, and the resegregation of many public schools.
"There has been a fundamental fear that has existed among black folks," said Mr. Rogers, who went to public schools here in the 1970's. "I said, 'O.K., if I send my kid across town, they'll be likely to put money in. But if the schools are resegregated, they will be less likely to put in resources.' "
In Denver, the end of busing two years ago coincided with a perception of general decline in academic performance in public schools.
Last month, the first districtwide reading and writing scores for 4,700 fourth graders illustrated just how low minority achievement is in the schools. The results showed 58 percent of white students were proficient in reading and 31 percent were proficient in writing. Among black and Hispanic students, 24 percent were proficient in reading and 10 percent in writing.
Even before those scores were released, the parents of black and Hispanic students, who account for three-quarters of the 68,000 in the system, were widely dissatisfied.
A survey of Denver voters in May by Ciruli Associates found that 93 percent of blacks and 80 percent of Hispanic respondents agreed that "some children in the Denver public school system are receiving a substandard education."
Despite Denver's reputation for high education levels, the high school dropout rates are 34 percent for Hispanic students, 23 percent for blacks and 16 percent for whites.
Anger over the situation is aiding the voucher movement.
Last week, proposed language for an amendment to the State Constitution that would permit vouchers was submitted to a legislative review council by Tom Tancredo, president of the Independence Institute, a conservative policy group here.
Opponents of vouchers, who argue that they would undermine public schools, are quick to point out that in 1992 Coloradans rejected, by a 2-to-1 ratio, an amendment to give $2,500 to each child in the state to spend on the school of choice, public or private. The new proposal gives the Legislature two years to create "one or more pilot programs designed to empower parents to choose among the widest array of quality educational opportunities."
The Republican-controlled Legislature seems increasingly open to alternatives. Two weeks ago, faced with a request for an increase in the education budget, Tony Grampsas, chairman of the Joint Budget Committee, described the fourth-grade reading results as "really, really pathetic."
Last week, State Education Commissioner Bill Moloney threatened to withdraw accreditation from public schools that did not raise their reading and writing test scores.
In political circles, some critics say Mr. Rogers, a Republican, is trying to create a wedge between the Democratic Party and black and Hispanic voters, traditional supporters of the party. They say that by signing up 3,483 plaintiffs, he is furthering a hidden agenda: building a base for his campaign next year for lieutenant governor. Mr. Rogers dismisses those accusations, saying his sole motive in bringing the suit is poor conditions in the schools.
The suit, filed in Denver District Court against the city's school system, calls for vouchers and transportation for any students who want them, but it seems to have little chance of winning without a change in the State Constitution.
Mr. Rogers appears to be sowing fertile ground. In October, a "tax credit" for school choice was supported by 71 percent of 400 Colorado voters surveyed by Public Opinion Strategies, a national polling company.
Anti-voucher forces are unmoved.
"Creating a system of vouchers is not going to solve the reading problem," said Beverly Ausfahl, president of the Colorado Education Association, a teachers' union.
The best students would be skimmed from the public schools, Ms. Ausfahl said, while the poorest of the poor would not be able to afford private schools.
The Denver School Superintendent, Irving Moskowitz, argues in favor of strengthening public schools rather than helping finance private institutions. He said the district's student-teacher ratio is low at 22 to 1, that it has placed reading aides in the first and second grades and that it inaugurated mandatory summer school reading classes last summer for 3,200 students.
In addition, Mr. Moskowitz said, 20 percent of the students exercise choice by attending charter schools or magnet schools outside their neighborhoods.
"Realistically," he asked, "how many spots will there be in Denver private schools?"
Nationally, 11 percent of the 52 million elementary and high school students attend private schools. Denver is roughly in line with this trend.
Arguments like Mr. Moscowitz's do not sway Vivian Wilson, administrator of the Union Baptist Excel Institute, an all-black private school where discipline and a back-to-basics curriculum are underscored by plaid uniforms that all students wear. The school charges slightly less than half the $4,700 that Denver pays to educate each public school student.
"Everyone should have the right to choose, whether they are poor or not," said Mrs. Wilson, who waives her school's $52-a-week fee for one-third of its 179 students. "If you have the free-market system for education, you can't hold black or Hispanic people against their will."

Soak the Rich

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
"Did people really give each other the finger in 1912?" asked a skeptical teen-age film critic as we emerged, highly satisfied customers, from "Titanic." Well, in truth, that gesture was hardly the only deviation from historical verisimilitude in Hollywood's $200 million re-creation of the century's most beloved spectacle of mass death. My favorite was a painting in a stateroom that looked much like Picasso's "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon." If it indeed went down with the ship, then the picture at the Museum of Modern Art is the curatorial hoax of the century.
But such errors inevitably creep into movies like this. In the immortal Liz-and-Dick "Cleopatra," the Most Expensive Epic Ever Made in my youth, a Roman bath boasted a rubber sponge then ubiquitous in suburban American kitchens. The point of the grandest Hollywood period extravaganzas -- especially if they aspire to be box-office blockbusters -- is not to find the truth about whatever past is being re-created but to hit upon a crowd-pleasing sentiment about the present that will enthrall the movie's contemporary audience. 
 The Titanic has been the subject of roughly 20 movies to date, and, as Steven Biel demonstrates in his invaluable cultural history of the disaster, "Down With the Old Canoe," each reflects the mood of its own time. As the most popular Titanic movie until now, "A Night to Remember," expressed 1950's nostalgia for the pre-nuclear age, so our own "Titanic" was destined to be truer to 1997 than 1912, no matter how faithfully the director, James Cameron, reproduced every last brandy snifter of the White Star Line.
It's Mr. Cameron's screenplay, not just the special effects, that holds us for more than three hours, and it's very much a 90's take on the familiar Titanic themes of gender and class. His "Titanic" is driven by a feminist heroine who defies her stuffy First Class compatriots to take up with a guy in steerage. And that guy in steerage -- the movie's hero -- is, of all things, a penniless artist who draws nudes.
Mr. Cameron's villains, meanwhile, are rich men, who rarely fare well in Titanic retellings but do spectacularly poorly in this rendition. (They're even anachronistically damned as "masters of the universe," Tom Wolfe's 1980's phrase.) Along with the reliably skunky ship's owner, J. Bruce Ismay, there's a new, fictional tycoon who's a still bigger blackguard. The only prominent rich character who's not hateful is an earthy woman, Molly Brown, a democrat if not necessarily a Democrat.
Given the economic boom in America right now, it might seem surprising that the rich-bashing populism of "Titanic" would go down so easily. But the gap between the wealthy and everyone else is still with us, and Mr. Cameron, a prescient artist, sees past smooth seas better than the Titanic's captain did. While Americans generally do admire self-made millionaires who play by the rules, they can turn quickly, and rabidly, on those who abuse their power. George Soros, yes; Michael Milken, no.
After the Titanic sank in 1912, the radical labor leader Mother Jones gave speeches decrying the supposed gallantry of its wealthy passengers, most notably John Jacob Astor. In 1997 the movie "Titanic" has been released just as our own Astor, Bill Gates, is receiving the harshest criticism of his career as a consequence of Microsoft's thumbing its nose at a judge's order in its antitrust case. The new issue of Mother Jones, the present-day magazine, echoes its namesake's rhetoric about Astor when it likens Mr. Gates to "greedy" monopolists of the past. It's not the only publication taking that line.
When the ship sinks in Mr. Cameron's movie, tears are shed only for the poor. The wealthy are presented as ripe for comeuppance; though the most evil villain survives, we're quickly reassured that he will meet a grisly end anyway, appropriately enough in the crash of '29. Should Mr. Gates, or any other potentially hubristic baron of the New Economy, have any doubts about how a tycoon's arrogance plays in the court of American public opinion then or now, he'd be wise to join the mobs of moviegoers cramped like passengers in steerage to watch the sold-out shows of our new "Titanic."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
KOREAN COMPANIES ARE LOOKING RIPE TO FOREIGN BUYERS

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
South Korea, already humbled by having to accept an international bailout, is facing what could be another blow to its national pride: a wave of takeovers of its companies by American and other foreign corporations.
The nation's plummeting stock market and currency have made Korean companies potential bargains for foreign companies, just as the International Monetary Fund's economic rescue is forcing the nation to open up to foreign investment. 
 Moreover, most of South Korea's family-owned conglomerates are either bankrupt or reeling under heavy debts and are being forced to sell parts of their treasured empires.
The insolvencies are piling up fast. Just today, Chonggu Group, one of South Korea's biggest construction companies, sought court mediation to reschedule debts of more than $1.1 billion after banks demanded immediate repayment.
"The country is about to see a fire sale of some of its major assets, but that's the only way out," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, who dined with Korean business leaders in Seoul earlier this month. "There is a feeling of regret, that because of failures of business judgment, they are losing assets that took generations to acquire."
The expected acquisition spree is just beginning, and only a few concrete proposals have come to light. For instance, Bowater Inc., a manufacturer of newsprint in Greenville, S.C., is negotiating to buy a stake and gain some management control of the Halla Pulp and Paper Company and its huge new plant built with German technology, according to Halla. The paper company is owned by the Halla Group, which defaulted on its loans this month.
The troubled Hanwha Group, meanwhile, is negotiating to sell its oil refining company to a foreign buyer, reportedly Royal Dutch/Shell Group. It has already sold its half of a joint venture in chemicals to its partner, BASF of Germany, and is looking to sell 25 percent of its securities unit.
Even the American singer Michael Jackson is getting into the action, negotiating to acquire a ski resort from its owner, a bankrupt Korean underwear maker.
But these could be just the tip of the iceberg. Seoul is awash in "industrial tourism" as businessmen and financiers shop for properties.
"Anybody and everybody with money is looking at Korea," said an executive at the Seoul branch of an American investment bank. "Everybody seems to be doing their homework right now."
The Korean Stock Exchange's composite index has fallen 42 percent this year, near its 10-year low, while the Korean currency, the won, has lost nearly half its value against the dollar. Combining these declines, stock prices have fallen about two-thirds this year in terms of dollars.
Samsung Electronics, the world's largest producer of computer memory chips, now has a market capitalization -- the value of all its shares outstanding -- of $2.4 billion, about what it would cost to build one of its state-of-the-art factories.
Korean Air Lines, with a fleet of more than 100 jets, has a market capitalization of $240 million, less than the price of two Boeing 747's. As an anti-takeover precaution, employees' year-end bonuses are being used to buy 4 percent of the company's stock on behalf of the employees.
But the cheap market values can be deceptive because they ignore the sometimes enormous debt an acquirer might have to take on. Samsung has 11.9 trillion won, or $7.9 billion, in debt. The debt of Korean Air Lines is more than $5 billion.
Still, the prospect of foreign acquisitions has elicited some fear and anti-foreign sentiment in fiercely nationalistic South Korea. The Hankook Ilbo, a daily newspaper, illustrated an article with the headline "The Coming Corporate Hunting Typhoon" with a picture of a bald eagle, its wings spread wide, swooping down on Seoul.
But attitudes are already starting to change, as best exemplified by Kim Dae Jung, the nation's President-elect. During the campaign, Mr. Kim attacked the I.M.F. agreement, in part because it would lead to takeovers of Korean companies.
"Now foreign investors can freely buy our entire financial sector, including 26 banks, 27 securities firms, 12 insurance companies and 21 merchant banks, all of which are listed on the Korean Stock Exchange, for just 5.5 trillion won," or about $3.7 billion, he said at a news conference on Dec. 5, two days after the bailout was announced.
But on Dec. 19, the day after he was elected, Mr. Kim declared: "I will boldly open the market. I will make it so that foreign investors will invest with confidence."
Driving the change, of course, is the desperate need to attract foreign capital to avert a catastrophic default on South Korea's mostly private foreign debt. But some businessmen say that besides money, Korea could also use a dose of Western management and efficiency to make companies more competitive.
So, driven in part by the I.M.F., South Korea is dismantling rules that have made the country one of the hardest in the world for foreigners to invest in and do business in.
The amount of stock in a Korean company that a single foreign investor can hold was raised this month to 50 percent from 7 percent, allowing a foreign individual or company to get control of a Korean company in some cases. With an agreement reached this week, even that limit will be lifted soon for friendly acquisitions.
Even before this round of changes, however, it has been possible for a foreign company to buy a Korean company in a friendly deal approved by the Government. Hostile takeovers are banned, though that might change under the I.M.F. rescue.
Still, some analysts say that foreign companies will not move quickly, thinking that prices can still go lower and that the economy will sink deeper into recession. In addition, buyers and sellers are disagreeing on the appropriate price.
"Most of the people coming in have the attitude that everything is bargain basement" said Jeffrey D. Jones, a lawyer with the Seoul law firm of Kim & Chang. But Korean owners, according to Mr. Jones and other analysts, are not looking at market value, which they see as temporarily depressed, but at the higher figure of book value, which reflects what they invested.
Another factor discouraging potential buyers is that companies are often part of bigger conglomerates, making it difficult for a buyer to pry the shares loose. It would also be difficult in South Korea to do what acquirers often do in the West -- lay off workers and sell off unneeded parts of the operation. Some of those restrictions, however, are being eliminated as part of the I.M.F. agreement. And as one of the concessions it made as part of the latest round of international aid, Seoul agreed to ease the rules governing layoffs at banks and financial institutions to make these entities more attractive to suitors.
Buying will also not be limited to foreigners, as seen by the acquisition of troubled Ssangyong Motors by Daewoo Group, accomplished largely by Daewoo's agreement to assume $1.3 billion in debt.
The Government is moving to relax rules that hinder conglomerates from making acquisitions or owning more than 4 percent of a bank. The conglomerates are complaining that it is unfair and foolish to allow Korean companies and banks to be taken over by foreigners while locking other Korean companies out.
So far, the foreign acquisitions have tended to involve industrial companies buying out Korean partners in ventures..
For instance, Coca-Cola in November bought its main Korean bottler from the Doosan Group for 430 billion won, about $450 million at the time but now about $290 million. Procter & Gamble bought control of Ssangyong Paper Company from the Ssangyong conglomerate for $69 million when the deal was announced.
Rumors are flying about other potential deals. One report centers on the Ford Motor Company buying Kia Motors, the automobile company that declared bankruptcy last summer. Ford has declined to comment.
Ford and its Mazda subsidiary together already own more than 17 percent of Kia. The question is whether, to protect that investment, Ford might increase its stake in Kia to gain management control, as it did last year with money-losing Mazda.
Alexander Trotman, Ford's chairman, told reporters recently that Ford was not interested, according to Bloomberg News. But he said that if asked by the Korean Government to consider a takeover, "I'd react by buying a plane ticket and go see them to negotiate."
General Motors and two German companies, Robert Bosch and Sachs A.G., are said to be interested in buying Mando Machinery, Korea's largest maker of automobile parts.
Mando, which is part of the Halla Group, has a fundamentally strong business. But it guaranteed some loans to Halla's ship-building subsidiary, which defaulted, forcing Mando to seek court protection from creditors.
Another possible buyer is Ford, which has several joint ventures with Mando to make car air-conditioners and other components in Korea and elsewhere. It is already planning to increase its stake in one of the ventures, in Canada.
Foreign automobile companies, which have been virtually locked out of the Korean market, might be interested in buying the dealer network of Ssangyong Motor, which is likely to be put up for sale by Daewoo, which already has its own network.
In the financial sector, the Government has indicated it will sell at least one troubled bank to a foreign concern. Citibank and Chase have been rumored to be interested in buying something in Korea, though Citibank has denied it.
Despite the interest, Korean rules and sensitivities also might make some buyers think twice before acquiring national flag-bearers like Samsung Electronics and Korean Air. And it will be a long time before Seoul sees the rough-and-tumble takeover battles of the United States.
"I don't think you're going to have T. Boone Pickens or Carl Icahn dropping in to look around for cheap assets and launch a junk bond takeover," said Richard Samuelson, head of research at SBC Warburg Dillon Read in Seoul.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Marked Down"
South Korea's currency, the won, and its main stock index have both fallen so sharply since the country's financial crisis began that many publicly traded companies there have lost more than half their value in dollar terms. Here are some examples of how well-known Korean companies are now valued by the market.

Laotian Refugees Suffer After Food Aid Is Denied
The United States Department of Agriculture's decision to cut off food stamps to the families of Laotian veterans of the Vietnam War has led to despair and suicides among these refugees in the few weeks the cutoff has been in effect. A1 

Arafat Plans Peace Overture
Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat announced that he would present his own plan for peace with Israel when he meets with President Clinton next month. The plan includes a proposal to station international peacekeeping troops between Israel and the West Bank, maps for the next Israeli withdrawal and a concept for final status negotiations. The plan follows weeks of debate within the Israeli Government over which parts of the disputed West Bank should be retained by Israel. A3
 
Iraq Sees U.S. Plot
Iraqi leaders accused the United States of planning air strikes to plant false evidence of chemical or biological weapons in their country. They met to discuss the continuing crisis over Iraq's refusal to allow inspectors to examine some sites for signs of weapons of mass destruction. The White House immediately dismissed the charge as "ridiculous." A3
 
Flu Transmission in Hong Kong
International health workers reported the first evidence of probable human-to-human transmission of a new viral strain of influenza in Hong Kong. The transmission was detected from recent blood tests in a physician who cared for a 3-year-old boy, the first known human case of the strain, who became sick in May and later died. According to health officials, the virus was transmitted by physical contact and did not spread beyond the doctor. A4
 
Tibet Referendum Proposed
The International Commission of Jurists called for a United Nations-supervised referendum on the future of Tibet. It stated that the cultural rights of Tibetans have deteriorated sharply since a Chinese forum was held three years ago to study the Tibetan question. The commission has been following events in Tibet since the 1959 Chinese attack that forced the Dalai Lama into exile. A4
 
French Party Leader Convicted
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the far-right leader of the French National Front party, was convicted of violating a 1990 French law that made it a crime to deny the magnitude of the Holocaust. After he dismissed the gas chambers of World War II as a "detail in history," French civil rights groups filed a complaint against him, winning a judgment that will require him to pay $50,000 to publish the text of the decision in French newspapers. A5
 
Struggle for Candor in Chiapas
Mexican officials announced they had charged 16 men with first-degree murder in the killing of 45 people in a tiny village in southern Mexico on Monday. Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar said the case was in its "earliest stages." A6

Minority Parents Seeking Publicly Financed Vouchers
A new class action suit in Denver underscores the depth of support among black and Hispanic parents nationwide for a favorite cause of the conservative movement: publicly financed vouchers to send children to private or parochial schools. Joe Rogers, a black conservative lawyer who helped organize the suit, recruited nearly 3,500 mothers and fathers of public school students at black churches and Spanish grocery stores before he closed the rolls of plaintiffs last month.

A New Barbie Controversy
Puerto Rican Barbie was an instant hit when the doll was introduced in Puerto Rico in January by Mattel Inc. as part of the company's "Dolls of the World" line. But Puerto Rican Barbie has caused a heated debate among Puerto Ricans in the United States. Many on the mainland find her objectionable on several counts, from her light skin to her colonial-style tiered dress. They also bristle at the history lesson on some editions of the doll's box. A1
 
Bowles Considers Leaving
Erskine B. Bowles, President Clinton's chief of staff, has made no secret of his desire to leave the grind of Government service early next year -- after having made no secret of the fact that he wanted to leave last fall. But Mr. Clinton has made clear that he would prefer that Mr. Bowles leave later rather than sooner, in part because he does not have an obvious candidate to take his place at the White House. A1
 
Judicial Activism Challenged
A murder case in Pennsylvania has reopened the debate over whether Federal judges should be able to bar retrials of controversial cases on the state level. Pennsylvania's senior Senator, Arlen Specter, and two of its Congressmen have introduced legislation that would strip Federal judges of the power to ban many state retrials. A1
 
Web Sites Track Unabom Case
A series of Internet sites dedicated to coverage of the trial of Theodore J.

2d Christmas Fire for Builder
Seven years after a fire destroyed a Dallas homebuilder's house on the day after Christmas in 1990, he faces the same painful task again this year, after the replacement was destroyed on Christmas Eve. No one was home when the four-alarm fire broke out about 8:30 P.M. Wednesday. It took 68 firefighters more than an hour to put out, authorities said. The cause of the fire was being investigated but the owner said there had been recent problems with squirrels chewing through electrical wiring in the attic. (AP)

Six New York City police detectives have been suspended for failing to report their role in a Crown Heights bar brawl last week with a man who died beneath the wheels of a subway train less than two hours later, the police said. While the exact circumstances of the man's death remain undetermined, investigators have found a series of irregularities in the way police officers responded to the bar fight. B2
 
Mourning the End of 'Seinfeld'
Fans of "Seinfeld," the most popular television comedy series of the decade, were stunned at the news that Jerry Seinfeld had decided to stop producing his homage to single life in the city at the end of this season.
