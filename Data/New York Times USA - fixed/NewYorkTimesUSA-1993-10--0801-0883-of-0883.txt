HEADLINE: On My Mind;
How Dare We?

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
How dare the United States do this thing?
Alexander M. Haig Jr. wants to know. How dare the U.S. "go around telling the rest of the world" that it must live up to American human rights standards? He has China in mind. 
 "I think the time has come to take a different tack here," he said in Beijing. "And Tiananmen is a long way behind us."
Mr. Haig has a distinguished record -- Secretary of State, NATO commander, White House chief of staff. He was in Beijing to introduce the new president of United Technologies Corporation to Chinese Communist leaders. United Technologies is in the defense business.
Mr. Haig is a take-charge kind of guy. Right after President Reagan was shot in 1981, Mr. Haig, then Secretary of State, told the country that he himself was "in control" at the White House; Vice President Bush was in a plane flying to Washington.
The Haig decision did not sit well, probably because neither Mr. Reagan, Mr. Bush nor Congress had also so decided.
Anyway, you can see Mr. Haig deserves an answer and Washington better give him one in a hurry. Until then, I will do my best.
Mr. Haig, it really is a matter of taste and, if you forgive the expression, the moral responsibility of American business.
The taste of Congress, the incumbent President and most Americans kind of runs against governments that use forced labor in and out of prison as an official part of the economy, and torture as an inducement to both labor and political obedience.
In China, the Government uses the economic advantages of that labor, and of trade with the capitalist nations, to build the world's largest army -- and to sell missiles, nuclear material and weapon technology, mostly to nations hostile to America.
Mr. Haig, those Americans not well disposed to gulag government do not want to bomb China or isolate it. All they say is that it is hypocrisy and destructive of liberty to say we disapprove of Communist Chinese techniques of government and yet refuse to do what we can to pressure the gulag wardens into at least lowering the torture quotient of political life, in China proper and imprisoned Tibet.
Congress's taste, and expressed will, is to put a deal to your Beijing hosts: Loosen the handcuffs or we will lift the trade privileges that have made possible the $20 billion trade advantage China enjoys over the U.S.
Business is no more holy than diplomacy or journalism. Either can help build freedom or help maintain despotism.
Certainly it is obscene that profits made through the capitalist free-enterprise system be used to strengthen a Communist society that refuses to give its citizens and Tibetans the freedoms of choice that should be the very essence of capitalism.
I know of two U.S. companies that have adopted a human rights policy that does honor to them, their country, free enterprise and their customers. They have withdrawn their plants in China or are preparing to do so rather than contribute to the daily violations of decency that exist all around those factories.
So I am writing this dressed in a long-wearing, stylish pair of Timberland boots and long-wearing, stylish Levi Strauss shirt and pants.
Beijing may not tremble before Levi Strauss and Timberland. Neither did Pretoria tremble when some American company was the first to say: "No longer."
Mr. Haig says we should help China to offset Japan. Then we can balance the two superpowers of Asia against each other, instead of having to deal alone with Japan. Neat? Presumably Japanese and Chinese cannot figure that out and one day get together to give us a two-superpower squeeze.
Patrick E. Tyler, the New York Times bureau chief in China, who interviewed Mr. Haig earlier this month, writes that he was seething at U.S. policy toward China.
Mr. Haig is an excellent seether. I always liked him for that. We two may have faults but concealment is not one of them.
A press colleague told me Mr. Haig had said he would dearly love to punch me in the mouth for asking him a political question he thought impertinent in substance and manner. It was. Mike Wallace egged me on.
But since Mr. Haig never did punch me in the mouth I took the threat as mere wishfulness. If not, I hope he gets tired of waiting in line.

HEADLINE: Economy Won't Grow With Tax Subsidies

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Charls E. Walker, former Deputy Treasury Secretary, applauds Presidents who favored investment tax credits and liberalized depreciation rules, and criticizes those, like President Clinton, who do not advocate tax subsidies to encourage capital spending (letter, Oct. 18). 
 When there is a demand, and the ability to pay, for particular goods and services, providers will invest in the capital equipment to meet the demand with or without a tax subsidy. If there is insufficient demand or purchasing power, they are unlikely to buy unneeded equipment, even with a tax credit or larger deduction.
The best way to stimulate economic growth is to reduce the income taxes of those with lower incomes who have the greatest propensity to spend their extra dollars. Reducing taxes on income from savings and investment (such as interest, dividends and capital gains) is less effective in stimulating economic growth because those who receive unearned income are more likely to save or reinvest than spend tax savings.
Moreover, savers and investors do not need preferential tax rates to invest. What they need is a free market that encourages better goods and services, and consumers with the purchasing power to buy them. Our tax policy must fuel the growth cycle by priming the demand side, and the supply of investment capital for the new equipment and additional jobs will follow.

HEADLINE: Newark's $150 Million Answer to Lincoln Center Is Under Way

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Oct. 28

 BODY:
In a big tent pitched yards from a park where homeless men spend their days, the air was heady with hope and promise and symbolism.
As the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra played Aaron Copland's "Fanfare for the Common Man," arts mavens, corporate heads and politicians were joined by 21 schoolchildren from each of New Jersey's 21 counties to break ground today for what will clearly be more than just a new building in downtown Newark. 
 To some, it is New Jersey's Lincoln Center, a world-class venue second to none. To others, it is an economic boon creating hundreds of new jobs. And to all involved, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which will stand literally a stone's throw from where Newark's founders landed in 1666, is a giant stake in the future of the state's largest city.
The center is riding on the hope that a dazzling showplace for acclaimed acts will transcend Newark's image as a dangerous, crime-ridden place.
 
From Ashes of Hotel
 Much as Lincoln Center transformed a forlorn section of Manhattan when it was built in the 1960's, the $150 million New Jersey center is expected to breathe new life into this struggling city of 275,000 residents. It will rise from the ashes of the old Military Park hotel, a building that stood vacant and crumbling for years before it was imploded in May. The center will include a 2,700-seat theater and a 500-seat playhouse fronted by a public plaza, Theater Square, approximately the size of Rockefeller Center Plaza.
Planners say the center, which is scheduled to open in 1996, is expected to draw an annual audience of 650,000 to downtown Newark. It would increase business by $25 million a year in Newark alone, with an additional benefit of $35 million a year to the state.
It is expected to create at least 625 new construction jobs. Economic impact studies also count 470 permanent jobs, with most of those in Newark. And the ripple effect of the center, according to studies, would help support 6,700 jobs in the city.
Lawrence P. Goldman, who directed the development of Lincoln Center and presides over the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, said that the New Jersey center would be both an international arts center and a home for state arts groups like the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra.
 
'The Greatest Performers'
 "It will be multifaceted," Mr. Goldman said. "We're going to have the greatest performers in the world and we're going to do experimental things. Our real challenge is to be meaningful both to those people who patronize the arts and those who wouldn't ordinarily attend, either because they can not afford to or haven't been exposed."
The center has several potential audiences, including the 55,000 people who travel to jobs each day in Newark's downtown business enclaves. The hope is that it will also attract visitors from New York and the suburbs who will eat at Newark restaurants, take in the world-renowned Newark Museum, even stay at the city's hotels.
The center, designed by Barton Myers of Los Angeles, is also expected to attract new businesses. A large empty building across from where the center will be has already been bought for $2.5 million by private investors banking on the center's success. The investors plan to spend $25 million to renovate the building, the former Hahne's department store, which was famous in Newark's heyday, for retail shops and offices.
Newark's historic Military Park, which stands across from where arts center will be built, will get a much-needed sprucing-up. The Military Park Garage, underneath the park, will be renovated and modernized.
 
Not on Projects Alone
 In a note of caution, James W. Hughes, chairman of the Department of Urban Policy and Planning at Rutgers University, has said that while the center would be important to serve the city's residents and recapture business that drifted to the suburbs, it was important not to stake the city's entire revitalization on projects alone.
But for the planners today, there were no qualms about the project's value. "At a time when society is too divided, at a time when conflict in New Jersey and elsewhere is too heavy, the arts center has united all different kinds of people," Mr. Goldman said.
The center was sponsored by both public and private dollars. Several organizations donated more than $1 million, including the S. I. Newhouse Foundation, the Merck Company Foundation and the Prudential Foundation.
The soprano Kathleen Battle and the Newark Boys Chorus performed for hundreds at the ceremonial groundbreaking.
But not everyone was there to celebrate. A coalition of Hispanic and black contractors protesting their exclusion from the center's construction, protested across from the groundbreaking tent, chanting as Mayor James made his remarks.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 30, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the groundbreaking for the New Jersey Performing Arts Center misstated the background of Lawrence P. Goldman, president of the arts center. He oversaw the renovation of Carnegie Hall, not Lincoln Center. Because of an editing error, the article also included an incomplete reference to Newark's Mayor. He is Sharpe James.

HEADLINE: U.S. SAYS ECONOMY GREW AS INFLATION SLOWED IN SUMMER

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
The economy perked up during the summer, expanding at a 2.8 percent annual rate despite floods and drought that cut farm output, the Commerce Department reported today.
At the same time, inflation subsided to a 1.8 percent annual rate, the weakest rise for a quarter since oil prices collapsed in 1986. 
 This combination of stepped-up growth and slackened inflation was hailed by the Clinton Administration as early dividends of its economic policy, particularly the legislation enacted in mid-summer aimed at cutting the budget deficit.
"Lower deficits, lower interest rates have sparked the beginning of a significant economic recovery," President Clinton said at a news conference.
 
Proof of Acceleration
 Today's figures supported the growing belief among many economists that there has been a clear acceleration of the economy, beginning in late summer. The report, which covers July through September, not only showed improvement from earlier in the year but also confirmed more recent signs of strength in car and home sales and business at department stores. Earlier this week, the Government announced a hefty jump in orders for long-lasting factory goods.
"The problems that depressed the economy in the first half -- weak consumption and the inventory cycle -- have been put behind us," said Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "The growth rate in the third quarter is consistent with a modest and steady economic expansion."
 
 
Substantial Improvement
 The 2.8 percent annual growth rate was the briskest since last year's final-quarter surge, when the economy expanded at a 5.7 percent rate, and considerably better than the weak advances of eight-tenths of a percent in the first quarter and 1.9 percent in the second. The quarterly rise was the 10th consecutive gain since the end of the latest recession, officially designated as March 1991.
The economic revival, though widespread, is far from uniform and has eluded some areas, especially California, which has been hit heavily by military cutbacks.
That state's unemployment rate was 9.4 percent in September, more than twice the 4.2 percent rate in North Carolina, which enjoyed the lowest rate among the big industrial states. The national average is 6.7 percent.
A Labor Department tally released today showed that first-time claims for unemployment insurance nationwide fell 4,000 last week, to 347,000, a change considered inconsequential. Job worries remain a leading factor in depressed consumer confidence.
Over all, the Government's report on gross domestic product -- the total value of goods and services produced within the nation's borders -- was about as expected. But many analysts found it somewhat stronger in light of Commerce Department calculations that Midwest floods and Southeast drought had lopped six-tenths of a point off G.D.P. in crop losses alone.
Further impact of the floods could not be quantified, but there should be added growth in coming quarters as companies and households continue to replace flood losses.
Another retarding factor was weak automotive production, with assemblies dropping at a 31 percent annual pace in the July-September quarter. This cost G.D.P. a full percentage point, according to Lewis Alexander, the Commerce Department's chief economist. In recent weeks, however, sales of cars and trucks have surged and the third-quarter loss of output will be regained if producers meet current production schedules.
W. Van Bussmann, associate economist at the Chrysler Corporation, said he was encouraged by the report, which showed consumer buying to be among the strongest factors.
 
 
Money After Mortgage Payments
 "The ability of consumers to make purchases, both large and small, is good," Mr. Bussmann said. He and other economists said that while confidence remained low, at least as measured by formal surveys, this summer's budget deal seems to have dispelled some uncertainty.
And low interest rates have inspired mortgage refinancing, which has provided extra money for consumer spending.
Spending on personal consumption climbed at a 4.2 percent pace during the third quarter, up from a gain of 3.4 percent in the spring, today's report showed. Still, modestly rising household incomes, sizable increases in installment credit and the benefits of refinancing mortgages were not enough to pay for the spending, and the personal savings rate for the quarter slumped to 3.7 percent from 4.4 percent.
Investment in new equipment also helped power third-quarter growth as companies sought to minimize unit labor costs by substituting machinery for workers and their increasingly expensive health benefits. The 9 percent rate of increase, however, was only half as large as the increase in the first half of the year.
Exports fell somewhat, however, because of continuing weakness in the economies of many of America's trading partners. But the decline was less than in the April-June period. The Commerce Department assumed a small widening of the trade deficit in September, for which results are not published until mid-November.
Military purchases resumed their decline after a record first-quarter cutback and negligible second-quarter uptick.
 
'Decent Acceleration'
 Despite the drags, the Clinton Administration and most private economists expect G.D.P. in the current quarter to exceed the 2.8 percent third-quarter pace reported today.
"I'm talking 4 percent," said Elliott Platt of the investment firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, pointing to what he called a "decent acceleration" in the economy.
The lower inflation in today's report meant that most of the advance in G.D.P. was actual growth, rather than adjustments for inflation.
The fixed-weighted price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures prices paid by United States residents, climbed at a 1.8 percent pace in the summer, well below the 2.9 percent spring pace.
G.D.P. expressed in current dollars, rather than dollars adjusted for inflation, rose at a 4.4 percent rate in the quarter just ended, barely ahead of the second quarter's 4.3 percent pace.
Receding inflation means more of each added dollar of G.D.P. reflects added production, rather than simple price increases.

HEADLINE: MODERATE GROWTH IN SEESAW PATTERN SEEN FOR ECONOMY

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The economy is showing more signs of life, but even third-quarter growth of 2.8 percent, announced on Thursday, is not likely to be the start of a prolonged period of smooth, strong expansion.
Many economists predict that the economy will grow moderately in coming months. But the process is likely to continue to be choppy, they caution, with periods of solid expansion alternating with anemic growth like that in the first half of this year. 
 While this kind of up-and-down existence may seem unusual -- and discomforting -- such a ride is not uncommon. Economic dynamics are such that spending and production rarely happen smoothly. The reason the uneveness stands out now and feels so painful, economists say, is that the underlying pace of growth is so modest.
 
Sensation of Growth
 In a more robust recovery -- like most of those in recent decades -- one quarter might grow at an annual rate of 2 or 3 percent and the next quarter at 8 or 9 percent, but the overall sensation would still be of an economy moving ahead strongly, creating new jobs at a hefty clip. Although there is often a good deal of volatility, growth in the years after a recession typically averages about 5 percent.
With an economy like the current one, with growth swinging between half a percentage point and 5 percent or 6 percent, the feeling is one of teetering on the edge of no growth at all, and average growth is no more than about 3 percent, considerably lower than usual.
"You've got some big quarters and some little quarters, but by and large 2.5 percent to 3 percent is what you see and what you'll get," said David Wyss, a forecaster at Data Resources Inc.
That is not to say that there is no difference between the 1 percent growth rate of the first half of the year and the roughly 3 percent of the summer. If the economy persistently grew at 1 percent, unemployment would climb and aggregate wages would almost certainly fall.
 
Good for Long Haul
 At 3 percent, employment grows and so do wages, although progress on both fronts may be so slow as to seem nearly imperceptible at times, and is not likely to make most Americans a lot happier any time soon.
"Over the short haul, 3 percent doesn't do a lot," said William Dickens, a labor economist at the President's Council of Economic Advisers. "But over a few years, it will push the unemployment rate below 6 percent and create some real wage growth."
Slower overall growth also increases the likelihood that certain regions and certain workers will be left behind.
"The economy recovering doesn't mean a recovery for all workers," said Kevin Murphy, an economist at the University of Chicago. "That's been one of the major lessons of the last decade, and I expect it to continue.
"We economists tend to focus on the national numbers, but when it gets down to individuals, the national numbers are only a small part of the picture. What's going on in an industry, a region or your educational group is what matters for the individual."
Strikingly, executives and economists say growth in the range of 2.5 percent to 3 percent will not make Americans feel much better very fast, any more than cruising on a highway in second gear makes it fun to drive a BMW.
"Prospects are getting better, but exceptionally slowly," said Harvey Rosenblum, research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. "Most Americans feel that 2 percent to 3 percent growth is not enough."
For one thing, at that rate it would take another couple of years for the unemployment rate to get down to 6 percent, the rate many economists said they thought was the long-run full-employment rate.
"What makes people feel better is for the unemployment rate to go down and wages to go up," Mr. Dickens said. "Unemployment won't come down soon and wages won't be going up a lot."
Unemployment, which fell an entire point in the last year, could easily stay in the 6.5 percent range in the next year if labor-force growth picks up a bit, as it almost always does as job opportunities grow, and if productivity gains keep coming, as many business executives said they believed they would. As for wages, palpable gains beyond inflation are not likely until the slack disappears in the labor market.
 
 
Winners and Losers
 Growth in the 3 percent range also means that lots of Americans -- whether military-industry engineers or Californians or young workers with high school degrees -- will continue to feel as if the recession lingers for them, even as software engineers or Coloradans or biotechnology doctorates do well.
Despite the cautions, the recent strength could hold the seeds of further growth. In contrast to just a few months ago, many business executives and consumers are acting -- and sounding -- as if they expect the moderate growth and gradual improvement in the job market to continue.
Business is certainly behaving as if it expects the economy to keep expanding. Business help-wanted advertising is about 20 percent higher in most regions than it was a year ago. And, outside of manufacturing, hirings have outpaced layoffs by 150,000 jobs a month since last fall. Orders for business equipment are 14 percent higher than a year ago and spending on new equipment, especially high-technology hardware, is up by double digits.
Consumers are also sounding more hopeful. The University of Michigan reported yesterday that consumer expectations, one ingredient in the Government's forecasting gauge, jumped in October, though expectations remain relatively low.
While expectations do not always translate into more spending, these figures follow months of solid spending. Consumption rose at a strong 4.2 percent annual rate this summer, after increasing at a rate of 3.5 percent in the spring.
 
Mortgage Refinancing Helps
 The spending has been financed partly by gains in wage and salary income, which have been modest, and by mortgage refinancings (which have freed up roughly $100 billion in household cash flow in the last three years, said Lyle E. Gramley at the Mortgage Bankers Association) as well as by gains in the stock and bond markets.
Besides, some threats to growth have receded. Business stockpiles are extremely lean, so extra sales should translate into production over the next several months. There are few signs of capacity shortages or inflationary pressures to cut off growth. And, with banks advertising heavily to draw new business customers, the credit crunch is less of a constraint on most small- and medium-sized businesses.
Like the 1980's expansion, the 1990's expansion, which is taking place against a backdrop of huge shifts in Government policy and in the marketplace, is apt to benefit different industries, regions, and, most of all, individuals.
Take wages. The fact that they have stopped falling in the aggregate masks large increases for some and big declines for others.
"If you're in a period where inequality is growing, peoples' fortunes don't turn so much on what happens to the economy as a whole," said Professor Murphy, who contends that the forces that were creating million-dollar ballplayers and driving down the pay of workers at the bottom in the 1980's still seem to be at work in the 1990's.
New York is a case in point. Personal income in the region surged in the last year at the same time that the region's labor force was shrinking as workers left the area or became too discouraged to keep looking for work. What is happening, regional economists say, is that very high-skilled workers -- bond traders, for example -- are still in great demand and are being rewarded accordingly.
 
Manufacturing Loss Stunning
 The same disparities are evident when it comes to job creation. Manufacturing has lost a stunning 1.5 million jobs since the recovery began -- a surprise even to most economists who said they thought manufacturing's share of employment would decline in the 1990's. On the other hand, nursing homes, hospitals and school districts have added about that many new jobs to payrolls.
Thus, a teacher who lives in Tarrytown, N.Y., faces radically different prospects from those confronting a worker at General Motors' Tarrytown plant, which is scheduled to close in a few years, or a 50-year-old I.B.M. manager, threatened by cutbacks.
Furthermore, there are plenty of risks lurking in this uneven situation. The slump that stretches from Toronto to Tokyo could get worse. Higher taxes could dent spending. The Clinton health care program could keep small- and medium-sized businesses from hiring as they sort out how hard they will be hit. Or consumers could get giddy again this Christmas, the way they did last year, spend beyond their means and set the economy up for a fall.
Most economists said they thought the risks were likely to be averted. Despite the recent improvement in mood, they say, consumers are not likely to turn as euphoric as they did last year, after the Presidential election. At the same time, housing and autos are clearly picking up even as other economic sectors, namely exports and military spending, weaken. Builders dug enough foundations this summer to assure that construction spending will keep rising for several more months and the perception that interest rates are about as low as they are likely to go is apt to stimulate spending on big-ticket items.
"The economy in the second half looks good," said Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch, "and it's probably not going to collapse again in January."
George N. Hatsopoulos, the president and chief executive of the Thermo Electron Corporation, which has been benefiting from strong business investment spending, said: "I think it's likely we'll see a little higher growth than in the spring. It won't be a booming scenario though."

HEADLINE: Bonds Fall on New Economic Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury prices retreated yesterday as reports of economic strength made investors nervous as they looked ahead to the October employment figures due at the end of next week.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond fell 8/32 of a point, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.96 percent from 5.95 percent on Thursday. 
 Of particular interest to fixed-income investors was a survey showing a sharper-than-expected improvement in Midwest manufacturing conditions this month. While the survey of Chicago-area purchasing managers is viewed in the credit markets as a minor report, it attracted interest because it is considered an indicator of a national purchasing managers' report due on Monday.
Another survey, by the University of Michigan, pointed to improving consumer confidence in October, traders said. The survey is not released publicly, but there were reports that the index of consumer sentiment rose to 82.7 for October, from 77.9 for September.
Those results seem to defy a report released Monday showing that consumer confidence plunged in October. The Michigan report and the Chicago purchasing managers' survey increased concerns that the economy would show sharply higher growth in the fourth quarter.
"It confirmed other news that manufacturing is doing better," said William Dudley, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The bond market tends to react negatively to news of economic growth because it raises the likelihood of higher inflation, and inflation can reduce the value of bonds and other interest-bearing securities.
In addition, bond market investors fear that the Federal Reserve will react to threats of higher inflation by pushing up short-term interest rates on newly sold securities. Higher rates tend to curb inflation pressures, but they can also reduce the value of existing bonds.
Alan Levenson, the money-market economist at UBS Securities, said some economists were revising their forecasts higher ahead of the October employment report. Projections had previously called for an increase of 150,000 nonfarm payroll jobs.
In trading yesterday, short-term Treasury notes fell 3/32 to 5/32 of a point, while intermediate-term notes fell 3/16 to 13/32 of a point.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.52, to 1,324.59.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was unchanged at 3.02 percent. The discount rate on both six-month and one-year bills rose a basis point, or a hundredth of a percentage point, with the six-month rate at 3.17 percent and the one-year rate at 3.32 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10413/32 , up 2/32 from late Thursday. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.48 percent.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Up for a Sixth Month

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Consumers spent more in September, racking up a sixth consecutive monthly rise, the Commerce Department reported today.
Consumer spending, which powers two-thirds of national growth, rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.43 trillion, after a revised identical gain in August. 
 The higher spending was evident in Thursday's third-quarter gross domestic product report, which showed that national output rose at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the quarter after rising at a 1.3 percent pace in the first six months. The stronger growth rate -- the best quarterly performance this year -- was attributed primarily to rising consumer spending.
The Commerce Department also said total incomes grew by two-tenths of 1 percent in September, to a rate of $5.44 trillion, following a 1.3 percent increase in August. It was the second consecutive month for income gains after a decline of three-tenths of 1 percent in July.
Another survey suggested that consumers were confident about their economic future. That survey, a report by the University of Michigan on consumer confidence -- a measure of optimism -- showed a surge to 82.7 in October from 77.9 in September.
And the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said its index of corporate buying plans ticked upward to 57 percent in October, from 54.5 percent in September.
"I think we have kicked onto a slightly higher growth track for the economy so that our trend rate for the next year or so will be around 3 percent," said Raymond Worseck, an economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
In another report today, the Agriculture Department said prices received by American farmers declined seven-tenths of 1 percent in October after surging in September. Compared with a year earlier, farm prices were 4.3 percent higher in October.
Personal savings fell in September, to an annual rate of $190.2 billion, from $195.8 billion. The rate shows savings as a percentage of disposable income. It fell to 4 percent in September, from 4.1 percent in August. That meant Americans were saving just 4 cents out of each dollar they earned after taxes last month.
Spending on expensive, long-lasting durable goods was virtually unchanged in September from August and most of the overall increase was for more purchases of nondurables like food and paper products.
Spending on services, like accounting and medical care, gained slightly in September.

HEADLINE: Clinton Pushes Trade as New Frontier

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Evoking the memories and language of John F. Kennedy to make a case for continued American involvement abroad, President Clinton said today that the United States cannot turn away from global economic commitments that he said constitute "our new frontier."
Mr. Clinton, who joined members of the Kennedy clan at a ceremony marking the opening of a new museum at the John F. Kennedy Library here, said that his domestic and foreign policy objectives are what President Kennedy would have worked for. 
 Surrounded by hundreds of former Kennedy staff members, replicas of rooms in the Kennedy White House and photographs of the Kennedy Presidency, Mr. Clinton did not hesitate to proclaim himself heir to the Kennedy mantle.
But when he spoke of foreign policy he talked about trade, not American military involvement, insisting that the late President would have supported the Clinton Administration's efforts to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement. As Congress approaches a vote on the agreement with Mexico and Canada in two weeks, he said, lawmakers in Washington are at a moment of "high decision."
 
Photo of a Handshake
 Mr. Clinton has often credited President Kennedy with planting the seeds of his interest in politics after meeting the President at a Rose Garden ceremony honoring participants in Boys' Nation in the summer of 1963.
A grainy bit of film capturing that handshake became a stock piece of Clinton campaign footage last year and is now on view at the museum here. Another film, chronicling the 1962 Cuban missile crisis that was one of the high points of the Kennedy Presidency, is also on view at the library and Mr. Clinton watched it today with rapt attention.
Mr. Clinton found a receptive audience among the more than 400 Kennedy friends and admirers who gathered at the museum and stood in line -- some of them for more than an hour -- to shake Mr. Clinton's hand afterward.
Each of the Kennedys who spoke at the ceremony today praised President Clinton as a worthy successor to President Kennedy. Representative Joseph Kennedy, whose father, Robert, was assassinated in 1968, said that both his father and his uncle would have approved of Mr. Clinton.
 
'My Father Is Smiling'
 "Somewhere in this universe, my father is smiling on today's events," Mr. Kennedy said. "I believe he would smile upon your Presidency."
Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, who with her husband, Edwin, has spearheaded the effort to renovate the library, added, "President Kennedy lives on in those he inspired to enter public life."
Mr. Clinton has never discouraged comparisons of himself to President Kennedy, and today he appeared to bask in the regard of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Ethel Kennedy and others. Mrs. Onassis leaned over to grip his hand after he spoke today and said, "That was wonderful."
In describing the accomplishments of his 10-month-old Administration, Mr. Clinton drew comparisons between the Peace Corps and the National Service Corps, between the launching of the space program and the continuation of funding for the space station.
President Kennedy, he said, renounced isolationism in favor of an expansionist view of the world.
 
Subtext: The Trade Agreement
 "He believed that billions of lives depended upon our leadership and our ideals, and in turn, that our own security and prosperity are tied to reaching out to the rest of the world," Mr. Clinton said.
In effusively praising the late President, Mr. Clinton never strayed far from his subtext, the trade agreement. He even jibed Senator Edward M. Kennedy for not taking a stand in favor of the trade agreement, pointing out that Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the former House speaker, and Representative Kennedy have both endorsed it.
"And I believe if President Kennedy were still representing that seat in Congress, he would endorse it as well," Mr. Clinton said, prompting Representative Kennedy, who was seated on stage nearby, to clap his hand on his uncle's shoulder. Senator Kennedy responded by grabbing his necktie and pretending to choke himself with it.
Senator Kennedy said later that the pitch from the President and his nephew was "very persuasive," but that he remained uncommitted on the trade agreement.
As Mr. Clinton has traveled this week to New York and Boston, he has hammered hard on the need for passage of the trade agreement. He visited the South Boston headquarters of the Gillette Company today to continue that plea, standing beside Representative John Joseph Moakley, who opposes the trade agreement, as he asked Gillette employees to ask their Congressional representatives to support the pact.

HEADLINE: Labor Official Retreats on Higher Minimum Wage

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Under pressure from the White House, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said today that he would delay until next year his plans to recommend a higher minimum wage.
Two weeks ago Mr. Reich said that by the end of October he would recommend that the minimum wage, now $4.25 an hour, be increased by about 25 cents. But White House officials warned him immediately afterward that such a move would be unwise because it could antagonize business leaders at a time when President Clinton needs them for his health care and trade proposals. 
 Mr. Reich said in a statement today that "in light of the historic deliberations over health care," he had advised Mr. Clinton "to defer any decision on a minimum-wage increase until Congress has had further opportunity to consider the President's health care plan." He said he had advised the President to "revisit the issue next year."
Several Administration officials said that calling for a minimum-wage increase now would only complicate efforts to win Congressional approval of the President's health care plan because business owners are already worried that the health plan would raise their costs.
In an appearance at the National Press Club on Oct. 12, Mr. Reich said a 25-cent increase in the minimum wage, when coupled with an increase in benefits like insurance, which is called for in the President's health plan, could actually bring the value of the overall increase to 50 cents an hour.
Mr. Reich said today that after reviewing economic studies on the effects of minimum-wage increases, he had concluded that "the minimum wage could be increased moderately with no loss of employment." Business groups dispute this, however, asserting that wage increases quickly translate into fewer jobs.
When he testified about Mr. Clinton's health plan before a subcommittee of the the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday, Mr. Reich told the panel that some studies showed that increases in the minimum wage "induced more employment because people came into the market who would not otherwise want to come into the labor market."
In last year's Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton promised to raise the minimum wage, and since that time Mr. Reich has become the Administration's champion of such an effort. He often points out that the current wage, after taking inflation into account, is 30 percent below its 1968 level.
Last January, some Administration officials said they would push for a higher minimum wage in the summer and were considering an increase of $1 an hour, to $5.25. But they delayed making a recommendation, partly because the business community was so incensed with the Administration over tax increases in the President's deficit-reduction plan.
 
Complaints From Business
 Lobbyists for small-business groups are already angry with Mr. Clinton for proposing that all businesses be required to buy health insurance for their employees. They say this mandate will greatly increase small businesses' wage costs, although Mr. Reich asserts that it will increase wage costs for minimum-wage workers by 15 to 35 cents an hour.
Administration officials said that proposing a higher minimum wage not only would further alienate small businesses but could discourage them from hiring more workers just as the economy is gathering steam.
Mr. Reich has often contended that raising the minimum wage is an important step toward lifting all working families above the poverty line.

HEADLINE: Westchester Sees Replay Of Challenge By Legislator

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Oct. 29

 BODY:
During six terms as an Assemblyman, Richard L. Brodsky developed a reputation as a zealous and often abrasive legislator.
A New York Post columnist last year named him "most obnoxious lawmaker of the year" because he was so "arrogant and nasty." 
 Now, as Mr. Brodsky, a 47-year-old Democrat, makes his second bid to unseat Westchester's longtime County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke Jr., supporters say he has matured and learned the art of compromise. But they offer no apology for Mr. Brodsky's aggressive approach.
"Richard may be abrasive, but you need to be to get things done," said Assemblyman Paul A. Tokasz, a Buffalo Democrat and a member of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation, which Mr. Brodsky heads.
 
The Breaking of Furniture
 "He made some serious staff changes and told the senior staff members that 'we're going to be aggressive,' especially about some proposed legislation that had been 'hanging around for 10 years.' "
The committee passed the Clean Air Act under Mr. Brodsky's prodding, and not without difficulty, Mr. Tokasz said. "He had to deal with Assemblymen representing upstate communities, where we rely more on cars than they do in the New York metropolitan area, but Richard was able to craft legislation that passed."
Lee Wasserman, who heads the environmental planning lobby in Albany, said, "Richard always has a point of view on strategy, who needs pushing and who needs cajoling." He threatens, flatters and twists arms, and, Mr. Wasserman said, he "often treats people he's working with the same as he treats his staff," which is not always kindly.
But Audrey G. Hochberg, an Assembly Democrat who served for several years on the Westchester Board of Legislators with Mr. Brodsky, said his ability to work with others improved "when he took on a leadership position in Albany."
 
An Attack on Ethics
 "When he wants to make something happen he is willing to compromise, accommodating the needs of others, to make it work," she said. Still, there is the "breaking-furniture" syndrome, as Assemblyman Tokasz put it, when Mr. Brodsky is pursuing something he considers vital.
These days, he is on such a quest, arguing that Mr. O'Rourke, a Republican, lost interest in his job while awaiting a judicial appointment that evaporated with the election of President Clinton. He also charges that Mr. O'Rourke has transformed the County Executive's office into a family employment office, seeking jobs for friends and relatives and directing county contracts to companies employing his children or friends.
Mr. O'Rourke has denied wrongdoing and pointed out that a grand jury found he had broken no law. To that, Mr. Brodsky says the post of county executive deserves a higher standard than not being indicted.
"Andy O'Rourke," he said, "is a worn-out, self-contented politician who has become mired in scandal and who doesn't have the energy or the programs to keep Westchester moving, to keep it a good place to live."
Mr. Brodsky said his rival's approach is "similar to that of I.B.M. five years ago to look backward and hope things stay good."
 
Behind in Poll Calculations
 "Westchester needs a chief executive, not an administrator," he says. "We need somebody who understands what the loss of 40,000 jobs means, to understand that the unemployed are not merely the disadvantaged, to know what it's like to live and not work in Westchester."
As county executive, Mr. Brodsky said, he would tighten ethics laws, establish job-creation procedures, help establish small businesses and seek to revitalize downtowns.
He also has pledged to end what he calls the gridlock of the county legislature in its dealings with the County Executive's office and would focus on reaching an agreement with New York City on water quality of the reservoirs in Westchester County.
Although he has been endorsed in the editorial pages of The New York Times and the Gannett Suburban Newspapers, both of which supported Mr. O'Rourke last time, Mr. Brodsky admits he faces an uphill fight.
A poll released today by the Gannett papers show Mr. O'Rourke leading Mr. Brodsky by 48.5 percent to 37.8 percent.
 
A History of Confrontation
 The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, indicated that Mr. Brodsky remained unknown to many potential voters. When those polled were asked their general opinion of the candidates, Mr. O'Rourke was viewed favorably by 53.3 percent and Mr. Brodsky by 35.3 percent.
Mr. Brodsky said the poll was flawed because it selected respondents randomly, rather than selecting them from election registration records. He said his own polled showed him to be much closer, although still behind.
Mr. O'Rourke and Mr. Brodsky have been confronting each other for years, at least since they were members of the County Legislature, Mr. O'Rourke as chairman of the Republican-controlled body and Mr. Brodsky as his chief tormentor.
Both have finely honed senses of humor, and their barbed exchanges often punctuated the board's meetings. They have continued the practice since Mr. Brodsky began his siege of Mr. O'Rourke's office four years ago. He lost narrowly in that election.
The two have differed on the economy's impact on Westchester. Mr. O'Rourke says unemployment in the county is a relatively low 5.7 percent; Mr. Brodsky says Westchester has lost jobs, two-thirds of them white-collar, in 47 of the last 50 months.
Another major issue is taxes, with Mr. O'Rourke saying that he has held the line on county taxes. Mr. Brodsky encourages audiences to "go home and look at your 1993 tax bill to see for yourself if taxes did not go up."
Mr. Brodsky said he would cut the county executive's salary of $119,000 by 10 percent and reduce office staff by the same fraction. Mr. O'Rourke would like to add several assistant deputy county executives to oversee certain county departments. Department heads currently report to Mr. O'Rourke's deputy, Neil DeLuca.
 
Politics Outside of Washington
 Mr. Brodsky says his interest in politics "came out of my family's traditional sense of concern about community, society and justice." He adds: "It also came out of law school. The question I faced after leaving Harvard was, do I go into the private sector?"
He decided to work for the Robert Kennedy Memorial Foundation as chief of staff for a study of high school journalism. "We concluded that journalism in schools was a wondrous place to teach the rights of expression, and that high school newspapers should see their role as something more than covering sports and social activities," he said.
It was then that he decided to get into politics but out of Washington. He returned to Westchester, serving as legal counsel for County Executive Alfred B. DelBello, the first Democrat ever to hold that post in Westchester. Mr. Brodsky would be the second.
He was born in Brooklyn. The family moved to Westchester when Richard was 10. He graduated from Ardsley High School, Brandeis University and Harvard University Law School, beginning the practice of law upon graduation in 1971.
His specialty was entertainment and labor law, which led to his meeting Paige Massman. They were married in 1983 and have two daughters, Emily Lynn, 8, and Julianne Willie, 2. Mr. Brodsky spends his vacations in Montana, his wife's family's home.
The candidate is an accomplished piano player who specializes in blues and plays occasionally with a band called the Rugged Individualists. The Brodskys live in a historic house in the town of Greenburgh, just outside the village of Elmsford.
"It was the setting for James Fenimore Cooper's 'The Spy' and was restored after the British burned it down in the middle 1600's'," Mr. Brodsky said, adding that the house was "where the patriots met to defeat the Tories, and still is."

HEADLINE: U.N. Envoy Proposes Talks To End the Impasse in Haiti

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The United Nations' envoy to Haiti called today for new talks with the nation's military leaders and renewed demands that they take steps to comply with a negotiated agreement restoring democracy in the next two days or face a rapid cutoff of trade.
Speaking at a news conference on the eve of the original date set for the return of the nation's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the special United Nations representative here, Dante Caputo, said his organization would have "no alternative" but to extend sanctions if Haiti's Army leaders did not respond favorably to the call for new talks. 
 Mr. Caputo said that, at the least, Haiti could avoid tighter sanctions if its military leaders presented plans for compliance with the accord to bring democracy to Haiti, even if the compliance did not occur by the original deadline of Oct. 30.
There was no immediate response from Haiti's military leaders.
 
A Fixed Agenda
 Mr. Caputo said that the fixed agenda for the talks would include the return of a United Nations military training mission that was prevented from landing here earlier this month by a dockside protest by armed civilians who are believed to be closely allied with the military.
Asked what he would do if the military defied this latest initiative, Mr. Caputo said, "We are going to stick it out."
Mr. Caputo said the other points in the proposed discussion, which would be held here early next week, would include the need for Haiti's Parliament to pass laws separating the Haitian police from the military and a possible amnesty for the leaders of the military coup that ousted Father Aristide two years ago. Beyond these matters, the United Nations official, who has led diplomacy here for nine months, said that he would seek from the military commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, an early date for his retirement and for the quick return of Father Aristide.
In an interview on a local radio station Thursday night, General Cedras said that if the two parties to the agreement had failed to adhere to its provisions, the international community should have no other choice but to extract itself from the mediation.
General Cedras, who in the settlement had agreed to retire on Oct. 15, maintained throughout the interview that the Haitian Army has been joined in violating the country's settlement by both Father Aristide, who also signed it, and the United Nations, which had brokered it.
Mr. Caputo said that the agenda for his latest initiative had been fixed beforehand to prevent Haiti's military leaders from approaching the talks as if they were an invitation to renegotiate the previous agreement, which was signed by Father Aristide and General Cedras on Governors Island in New York City in July.
The garbage-strewn streets of Port-au-Prince were emptied of most automobile and pedestrian traffic today by the latest of several strike calls by newly formed far-right political parties, which have urged the military to continue holding out against Father Aristide's return.
As heavily armed police auxiliaries, some of them equipped with machine guns, machetes and hand grenades, patrolled the streets aboard pickup trucks and paraded through the downtown area, members of these rightist parties went on the radio to argue that if Father Aristide cannot return to Haiti by tomorrow's deadline, the entire Governors Island accord should be renounced.
 
New Elections Sought
 One of the groups, the Haitian Front for Advancement and Progress, said at a rally today that new presidential elections should be organized as quickly as possible. Mr. Caputo responded strongly today to these urgings, saying that any such move would be considered a grave violation by the Security Council, which would immediately apply new sanctions here.
"That would be a fake democratic transition aimed at ignoring the will of the Haitian people," Mr. Caputo said.
Haiti's economy is already slowing dramatically under the effect of a United Nations-imposed embargo on oil and arms supplies. Diplomats estimate that the country's gas stations have only enough supplies on hand to last 12 days. Likewise, diesel supplies are thought to be as low as 24 days' worth.
The effects of the fuel squeeze can be felt throughout the country, as electricity has begun to be tightly rationed and traffic has fallen off sharply.
If new sanctions are applied, United Nations officials say that they would probably include almost all forms of trade with Haiti, excepting food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.
 
Tensions Rising
 Tensions have risen sharply here in the final days before Father Aristide's originally scheduled return date. For the first time in several days here, a United States warship appeared in plain view in the harbor to reinforce the message of the sanctions. In addition to the increasingly frequent patrols of the police auxiliaries, dead bodies have begun to turn up with frequency each night in the streets of the capital.
Late Thursday a group of the auxiliaries, known here as attaches, followed a journalist's car downtown, waving guns in his direction before driving off and shooting a dog dead in the street. Early this morning, the bodies of two people were found shot nearby, close to the entrance of the Holiday Inn hotel.
Diplomats say that the pressure of economic sanctions and the resurgence of reports of heavy involvement by Haitian Army leaders in drug trafficking have increased tensions among units of the nation's military. The army command has issued two statements in the last 24 hours denying any involvement with cocaine trafficking.
A signed letter published earlier this week by enlisted members of the Presidential Guard strongly dissented from the direction in which General Cedras and the powerful Port-au-Prince police chief, Lieut. Col. Joseph Michel Francois, were taking the country.
Diplomats said that they could not confirm the authenticity of the letter. Senior officers at the military headquarters left little doubt, however, that they were taking it seriously.
"If I knew who they were, I'd kill them all," said a high-ranking officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. "They have no place in this army."

Boat People Face Prosecution
 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 29 (Special to The New York Times) -- Four of the 15 Haitian boat people repatriated here early this week after being picked up at sea by United States ships could be indicted by the public prosecutor as early as Wednesday on charges of organizing their aborted voyage, a United States Embassy spokesman said today.
Refugee advocates in the United States have criticized the Clinton Administration policy of summarily repatriating Haitian boat people picked up on the high seas because of the violence and political unrest here.
"The repatriation policy should be halted until President Aristide is restored," said Steven Forester, supervising attorney for the Haitian Refugee Center in Miami. "Until that is achieved, don't hand these people back to be prosecuted."
Mr. Forester said he had been told by diplomats that the returnees had been released. But it could not be confirmed late Friday.

HEADLINE: SHIFT ON CAMERAS BY NORTH KOREANS

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
North Korea continues to block thorough inspections of suspected nuclear-weapons sites, but will allow the resumption of routine maintenance of surveillance cameras, international atomic-energy officials and diplomats said today.
The North Korean concession on the cameras forestalls a threat of possible United Nations sanctions, but falls short of the regular inspections the country had promised the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
 Two sets of negotiations on the issue continue. The talks have been low-key but the stakes are high, said James Lilley, the American Ambassador to South Korea from 1986 to 1989.
In continuing talks at the United Nations, State Department representatives have held out the possibility of political and economic inducements to Pyongyang if they resolve the nuclear inspection issue. But they have told North Korean diplomats that serious talks about normalizing relations are impossible until it is resolved.
 
An Offer on War Games
 In three meetings at the demilitarized zone dividing North and South Korea, South Korea has offered to cancel a joint military exercise with the United States, in 1994 if the North will agree to exchange presidential emissaries and talk seriously about its nuclear program, diplomats said.
In January 1991, North Korea agreed to let the International Atomic Energy Agency inspect its nuclear sites, which include a small reactor, two large reactors under construction and a suspected plutonium reprocessing plant. An impasse arose in late 1992 when the agency began to suspect the North was concealing stocks of reprocessed plutonium, which can be used to make a nuclear weapon. Since the summer, North Korea has refused to allow maintenance on the cameras, and their batteries and film supply are due to run out around the end of the month.
In February, the agency challenged North Korea to allow full inspection of two suspected nuclear-waste sites. North Korea responded by threatening to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In April, the Clinton Administration decided to negotiate directly with North Korea.
 
Meeting Raised Hope
 Robert L. Gallucci, the assistant secretary of state for politico-military affairs, and North Korea's deputy foreign minister, Kang Jok Su, met in New York in June and in Geneva in July. Those talks raised hopes of the possibility of reduced political tensions between North and South Korea if the nuclear-inspection issue could be resolved.
North Korea's continuing refusal to allow outside inspections raised the possibility that a third meeting between the two might be canceled. It will not take place until the issue is resolved, diplomats said.
Negotiating with the North Koreans has been frustrating, said Arnold Kanter, an undersecretary of state in the Bush Administration who met with North Korean officials last year.
"It's an exquisitely isolated, insulated country," he said. "People on the outside really don't understand what they're up to, and God only knows what they perceive about the outside world. Perhaps they think the security of their country is at stake and that the only thing to guarantee its survival is the nuclear option. So they play that card for all it's worth."

HEADLINE: Mayoral Agenda: A periodic report on key issues facing the election winner -- Education;
Shaken School System Presents Major Challenges

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
From the day he takes office, the victor in Tuesday's mayoral election in New York City will have to take up the problems and the promise of the largest public school system in the country, in a major test of the future of public education in America.
He will have to find a way to renew public confidence in a shaken and divided public education system, while cutting spending to close a $2 billion long-term city budget gap. He will have to lead the fight for more state school aid, while coming up with $1.2 billion to pay for a five-year backlog in school maintenance. 
 In the face of these challenges, Mayor David N. Dinkins and his Republican-Liberal opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, both came up with plans that promise more innovations than cash.
Both say they want to push power downward to parents, principals and teachers. Both support new small high schools begun by the last Schools Chancellor. Both want better security, improved maintenance and schools that function as neighborhood centers.
Their main difference concerns how the Board of Education should be structured. The Mayor wants to get control of the board by expanding its membership and appointing a majority. Mr. Giuliani supports the establishment of five borough boards and the elimination of a central one.
 
Conflicts Over Money
 Many of the conflicts between mayors and the school system have centered on money: the city raises it, the schools spend it. What is unclear from the candidates' platforms is whether either man is willing to make schools a top priority and exert the leadership and the financial resources needed to rebuild the system.
The number of students has been growing -- it is at one million -- but when inflation is taken into account the city is spending about 8 percent less per student than it did in 1990. City budget officials attributed much of the reduction to cuts in state aid.
Schools are overcrowded, and the system faces a backlog of more than $1.2 billion in school maintenance and repairs -- 40,000 separate requests for everything from door locks to new roofs. Class size, even in the early grades, rose between 1990 and 1992 -- enough to eliminate the need for 180 teachers from kindergarten to third grade.
The cuts appear to have hurt spending on teachers and general education, which dropped by 5.6 percent in real terms, rather than ancillary services like school buses, leases and special education. According to the Board of Education, just under half of the school system's $8 billion budget goes to instruction.
 
Battling for State Financing
 For Mr. Dinkins, as for other mayors before him, one of the largest financial issues is getting a fair share of state financing. New York City has 37 percent of the state's students but receives 34 percent of aid from the State Legislature, a loss of $274 million last year, city officials said. Mr. Dinkins joined the Board of Education in suing the state over the difference.
Joyce F. Brown, a Deputy Mayor, said that Mr. Dinkins has already laid the groundwork for his vision for the future. He pledges to continue to provide for community groups to keep some schools open as community centers. Last year, 16 of the 1,069 school buildings were open after hours and during weekends. Four more opened in September, said Frank Sobrino, a Board of Education spokesman, with 12 more scheduled to be opened by the end of October.
He calls for the use of $200 million in surpluses from the Municipal Assistance Corporation to provide an endowment for public education to provide grants to innovative schools, and an extension of the school day and year, when funds become available. In the past he opposed efforts to use the surpluses for the schools.
Mr. Giuliani has also called for turning schools across the city into community centers. He said that he, too, wants to get more money out of Albany. But in a meeting with school advocates in July he dismissed the lawsuit as a "dumb way" to get results.
Instead, he said he would cut down on the bureaucracy, shift the money to pay for teachers and prove to the Legislature that additional school spending would not be wasted. Mr. Giuliani has also said he would pursue a demonstration project to see whether private contractors can do a better job of running schools than the school system. He cited an experiment in Baltimore in which a private company, Educational Alternatives, is subcontracting with the school board to run schools -- and make a profit.
 
Conflicts With the Board
 New York's is a school system that sometimes seems to be at war with itself, where during the last four years the influence of the Mayor on the Board of Education has sunk to perhaps its lowest level ever.
And after four years of social warfare, budget pressure, political maneuvering and declining mayoral influence, the system has lost the confidence of most New Yorkers -- fewer than one in seven voters now say they are satisfied with the quality of the schools.
While Mr. Dinkins wants to shift authority from the central bureaucracy to the schools, he is also pressing for legislation, as other mayors have done before him, to give the mayor control of an expanded central Board of Education by having him appoint 6 of 11 members.
It is a telling shift in position for the Mayor -- in part a response to a structural change in city government and in part to the difficulties of dealing with a large, unwieldy system -- with one million students, 65,000 teachers, 32 local school boards and 6,000 bureaucrats, the largest in the country.
During the 1989 campaign Mr. Dinkins, the challenger, said that he did not believe that mayoral control of the Board of Education, which the incumbent sought, was an important issue "because the mayor has considerable control through budgets and through the supports of his office."
But once in office, Mr. Dinkins was increasingly at odds with four of the seven members of the Board of Education, to which each of the five borough presidents appoints one member and the mayor appoints two.
 
Patronage and Social Issues
 At first the issue was patronage, but gradually it spread to social issues -- like the "rainbow curriculum" and condoms in the classroom -- which led to the ouster last spring of Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez.
The victor in the mayoral election will inherit a board majority and a Schools Chancellor who are not directly accountable to the mayor. A non-mayoral appointee is now president of the board -- the first in seven years -- and in late August the board appointed a new Chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, over the Mayor's objections.
Whether Mr. Dinkins or Mr. Giuliani can regain authority over the board remains an open question. The Mayor and his supporters attribute the loss in influence to changes in the city charter, which took effect in Mr. Dinkins's first year in office, that limit the budget powers of the borough presidents, thereby making them less dependent on the mayor.
His opponents attributed the shift in the balance of power to staff bungling and a lack of attention by the Mayor. They noted that the critical vote in the decision not to renew Mr. Fernandez's contract was made by Carol A. Gresser, now the board president, who was appointed by Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens, who is a Democrat.
While the Mayor blames his trouble with the board on board members "recruited as pawns in a cynical game of Republican mayoral politics," it is not clear that Mr. Giuliani would have an easier time with a board celebrated for its contentiousness. In any event, the terms of all board members expire next June.
 
Borough Boards
 Mr. Giuliani is instead supporting, with some caveats, legislation proposed by two Democratic borough presidents to shift the powers of the Board of Education to five borough boards, and to the 32 school districts and 1,069 schools. He said it was a way to shift more money from the bureaucracy into the classroom.
Mr. Giuliani's position on the issue was shaped, campaign officials say, by Edward N. Costikyan, a Democratic leader involved in the decentralization of New York City schools in 1969, who drafted the borough board bill for Mrs. Shulman and Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan.
Mr. Giuliani expressed doubts about the plan in July, citing a concern that it would add to patronage and waste, but announced his support in August, adding that he wanted to see a provision limiting the combined spending of the borough boards to no more than what is now spent centrally.
Ms. Messinger attacked Mr. Giuliani's position, complaining that by supporting her legislation he had "flip-flopped."
Mrs. Shulman welcomed Mr. Giuliani's support. "If Ed Costikyan is his adviser, he knows what he is doing," she said. "I support the Mayor strongly; his heart is in the right place. His sentiment is for the children. But I disagree with him on education."
 
Student Performance
 Student performance has been stagnant at best. Mr. Dinkins or Mr. Giuliani will have to find a way to nurture reforms and demand accountability or, some say, see the system of public education disintegrate under competitive pressures from the voucher movement, private schools and other alternative forms of education.
"The public schools are either going to make it in the next several years or they are going to go out of business," said Robert Berne, an associate dean at the Wagner School at New York University and the staff director of a major study of educational reform in New York.
Four years ago, when the mayoral campaigns turned to education the candidates focused on sweeping systemwide issues like the elimination of building tenure for principals or a simplified system for hiring teachers.
 
Power to the Parents
 Now both candidates have grounded their campaigns in school-by-school reforms, and say they support putting the money and power into the hands of those dealing directly with the children.
"I demand intense and radical change in our school system," Mr. Dinkins said in his major campaign speech on education last month. "Change that puts schools into the hands of parents and principals and neighborhoods."
Mr. Giuliani took a similar view in his position paper on education. "Across the country, educational reform has centered on management at the school level," he said. "Our central bureaucracy is such that these innovations too often occur despite, rather than because of it. Clearly we need a system that encourages creativity at the school level."
Behind this change is the limited school self rule, known as school-based management, in which parents, teachers and administrators share decisions.
Both candidates support more and better school security, improved school maintenance and reform of the costly and sometimes ineffective special education programs. They talk about accountability. Mr. Giuliani at once calls for a "back to basics" approach and for support for multicultural programs "inculcating racial and ethnic pride."

HEADLINE: With European Union's Arrival, Fears on Economy Cast a Shadow

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Oct. 29

 BODY:
This was to have been a day for the leaders of the European Community to celebrate finally the coming into effect of the Treaty on European Union. But instead, the summit meeting today was overshadowed by anxiety about growing unemployment and mounting welfare costs in their recession-stricken continent.
In a communique, the European Community leaders agreed to work more closely together to create jobs and economic growth after the Treaty on European Union goes into effect on Monday. 
 But even today, the 12 countries bickered for hours about how to divide 11 new European agencies among themselves before agreeing on Frankfurt as the site of the European central bank, which would some day administer the common European currency foreseen in the pact.
 
Ratified With Difficulty
 The treaty is known as the Maastricht treaty after the Dutch city in which it was signed. It was ratified late and with great difficulty by national electorates and elected Parliaments, which feared that Europe's separate nations would be swallowed up in a federal state dominated by powerful bureaucrats in Brussels.
"The debate has been salutary," the leaders declared here today at the end of an all-day meeting. "It has revealed weaknesses. It is now important to bring the union treaty to life."
Negotiated two years ago, the treaty had been scheduled to go into effect last January. It lays out a plan to link European currencies tightly enough together by 1997 to allow at least some countries to use a common currency.
But the European monetary system nearly came apart last summer under the strain of economic imbalances caused by recession and the reunification of Germany in 1990. Now, despite vows by the leaders today to try again, it is not clear that a common currency allowing the others to escape the domination of the German mark can come into effect even by the end of the century.
 
A Better Future
 Germany was the last country to ratify the pact formally, earlier this month. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other leaders came together here today to acknowledge the mistakes and difficulties of the past and to vow to make the economic future better than the troubled present.
"The citizens of Europe know that the Community has brought them an end of bloody wars, a higher level of prosperity and greater influence," their declaration said. "They know that today, even more than yesterday, isolation and retrenchment are false solutions, always illusory and sometimes dangerous."
But there was no discussion here today of the threat of a trade war, which could follow failure of a global agreement on tariffs and trade, imperiled by a dispute between the United States and France over agricultural subsidies.
With the total number of unemployed in their countries now approaching 20 million, the European leaders agreed today to try to come up over the next six weeks with a set of principles to stimulate more growth. But leader after leader acknowledged that unemployment would not go away when economic growth resumed, because for decades European labor costs had risen faster than productivity.
 
A Concern About Jobs
 "The Community's share of world markets has declined by about a fifth since 1980," Prime Minister John Major of Britain told his colleagues. "If we had been as good at creating jobs as other industrial countries over the same period, there would be nine million more people in work in the Community today."
He noted that since their last summit in June, about 250,000 more people had been forced onto Europe's unemployment rolls.
Britain did not agree at Maastricht to a catalogue of pledges to preserve the achievements of Europe's social welfare states. The 11 other leaders signed that part of the agreement then, but recently Germany, France and Italy have all scaled back generous unemployment benefits and companies all over Europe have eliminated thousands of jobs and threatened to cut wages to increase productivity.
Today, tens of thousands of Belgian workers demonstrated in anger in the streets of Brussels as the leaders met, following similar demonstrations in Bonn and strikes in France and Italy.
 
Homes for Agencies
 The concrete achievements of the politicians here were very modest. Mr. Major gave up on trying to get the European Monetary Institute, the forerunner of a European Central Bank, located in London instead of Frankfurt, though Britain does not want to join the single currency even when it is established. The monetary institute is to begin work in Frankfurt on Jan. 1.
The European leaders also decided that Europol, an organization for closer coordination of the fight against organized crime and drug smuggling, would be based at The Hague, and that the European environmental agency would be based in Copenhagen.
The leaders will meet here again Dec. 10-11 to discuss proposals to be worked out by Jacques Delors, the president of the European Community's Executive Commission, to combat the worst economic structural crisis on the continent since World War II.
 
A Call to Use Technology
 Mr. Delors, in a speech today, called for greater investment in transportation, telecommunications and other technological fields as a way to cope with the unemployment problems.
The leaders also vowed today to make a new start toward another of the Maastricht treaty's goals, a common foreign and security policy. They condemned recent atrocities by Croatian forces in the Bosnian village of Stupni Do and called once again for an end to all violence in the Balkans. They vowed to send more peacekeeping troops and said they would use "all appropriate means" to keep food, medicine and other relief aid flowing to victims of the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina, calling for specified sanctuary routes to allow passage of aid.
Diplomats conceded that these appeals probably would be no more effective than past ones and said the main thrust of the renewed attempt to formulate common European foreign policy would be elsewhere: toward the Middle East, South Africa and Russia, where expectations of success were more modest and realistic.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Big Loss and Job Cuts for Amdahl

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The Amdahl Corporation, the struggling mainframe computer manufacturer, reported a third-quarter loss today far in excess of analysts' already-pessimistic estimates.
The company also said it had suspended its quarterly dividend and would eliminate 1,800 jobs. 
 Amdahl said the $275.7 million loss reflected substantial restructuring charges associated with cutbacks in employment, manufacturing capacity and selected product-development programs, as well as other cutbacks tied to continued weakness in the markets for large-scale computing systems. The company, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said it was reorganizing its operations to bring its expenses in line with its lower business volume.
Amdahl released its results hours after the stock market closed today and postponed a conference call with securities analysts until Monday. Earlier, Amdahl's shares ended trading at $4.625, up 12.5 cents, on the American Stock Exchange.
 
Mainframes Called Vulnerable
 Analysts said Amdahl's core business, large mainframe computers, was particularly vulnerable to economic downturns. And they said that unlike the International Business Machines Corporation, its main competitor, Amdahl lacked other lines to fall back on. Reports of the demise of the mainframe have become a self-fulfilling prophecy, prompting large customers to defer purchases or consider alternatives, these analysts said.
For the quarter, which ended Sept. 24, Amdahl's net loss of $275.7 million was about nine times its net loss of $30.8 million in the 1992 third quarter. Revenues dropped 33.2 percent to $393.7 million from $588.8 million in the third quarter of 1992. This year's third-quarter results included pretax restructuring charges of $235 million; the 1992 quarter included pretax work-force reduction charges of $19 million.
Along with reducing its total work force by about 1,800 people, the company said it would eliminate a half million or more square feet of unneeded plants. The costs of those cutbacks have been included in the third-quarter restructuring charges. Some reductions will take place immediately, while others will be carried out over the next several quarters, with savings from these actions expected to be realized in 1994 and 1995.
Amdahl already cut its 8,500-member work force by about 1,100, or 13 percent, in late May.
Amdahl said it intended to pursue additional strategic alliances, like the agreement it entered last month to resell certain computers made by Sun Microsystems Inc. and another pact signed earlier in the year with the Electronic Data Systems unit of General Motors to jointly create and market applications development and production software.
The company said that uncertain demand and volatile pricing made it difficult to forecast future operating results.

Job Cutbacks Ahead at Dun & Bradstreet

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, a leading supplier of business information, said yesterday that it would cut several thousand jobs over the next two years.
The company said the reductions were in response to a weak global economy and would be made through attrition and possible layoffs. Dun & Bradstreet, whose operations include the Moody's bond rating company and Nielsen television service, has 52,000 employees worldwide. 
 As part of the cuts, Dun & Bradstreet's information services unit, based in Murray Hill, N.J., has offered voluntary severance packages to its 7,000 United States employees. The goal is to eliminate several hundred jobs in the division, a spokesman for the unit, David Monfried, said. The workers have until Nov. 5 to sign up for the package, which offers up to 12 weeks of pay and additional money based on years of service.
Mr. Monfried said the cuts were partly a result of the slow United States economy, which was hindering business demand for Dun & Bradstreet services.
Indeed, one of Dun & Bradstreet's own surveys, released on Wednesday, showed that small-business owners have grown more pessimistic than ever about the nation's economic future.
Dun & Bradstreet reported earlier this month that its third-quarter earnings rose 5.7 percent but that revenue slipped 2.7 percent, partly a result of weakness in its directory information and software services businesses.
Among its other businesses are the Nielsen market research and television ratings services and Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency.
Word of the planned cutbacks came after the stock market had closed. Shares of Dun & Bradstreet finished at $67, up 37.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Incentives of $31 Million Keep Kidder, Peabody in New York

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
In the latest high-priced deal to persuade a company not to move to the suburbs, Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that Kidder, Peabody & Company, the Wall Street firm, had accepted $31 million in incentives and would move its headquarters from lower Manhattan to Rockefeller Center.
The deal, in the wake of a series of corporate relocations out of New York City, came at a politically sensitive time, since Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Dinkins's opponent in the mayoral election on Tuesday, has repeatedly criticized the Mayor for losing too many battles to hold onto companies. 
 It came a day after Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, another Wall Street firm, said it would move 550 workers, about half its Manhattan work force, to Jersey City.
In early October, Lehman Brothers Inc., another Wall Street giant, said it would move 900 back-office employees to Jersey City, but would not move 5,000 other Manhattan employees, as had been feared by City Hall.
"The decision by Kidder, Peabody demonstrates in dramatic fashion that our job retention strategies are working," said Mr Dinkins, who has repeatedly described his efforts to retain big business as one of the strengths of his first term. The mayor claims credit for keeping 35,000 jobs in the city, in most cases through the use of tax incentives.
 
Lining Up at City Hall
 Others close to the deal said it came at a time when companies, hoping to extract incentives from the city, have been lining up at City Hall.
"Obviously there has been a flurry of activity that is tied to the upcoming election," said one high-ranking official of the Dinkins administration, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He added that companies are trying to negotiate with the city now because of "uncertainty about who they would be dealing with" after the election.
Kidder, Peabody, a unit of the General Electric Company, said it would move its headquarters and 2,000 jobs from its current offices in lower Manhattan to 30 Rockefeller Plaza, which is owned by General Electric.
It said the rest of its Manhattan work force of about 1,000 workers, most of them now assigned to a data-processing center in lower Manhattan, would be moved to another site near Wall Street that has not been determined. Leases on the company's current headquarters and data-processing center will expire in 1995, and the company is known to have been looking for new sites for more than a year.
A Kidder spokeswoman, Helen Keehner, said yesterday that the company had been "very close" to a decision to move its data-processing operations to Jersey City and its headquarters to Stamford.
The incentives Kidder will receive are in many ways similar to those extended to a host of large corporations that have threatened to leave since the mid-1980's. In exchange for its commitment to keep its 3,000 workers in Manhattan for 15 years, the company is to receive subsidized electricity, sales tax breaks on equipment and services it buys and property-tax reductions worth a total of $31 million.
The incentives "enable Kidder, Peabody to continue to operate in Manhattan on a cost-competitive basis," said Michael A. Carpenter, the firm's chairman.
In an interview, Carl Weisbrod, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, who has been one of Mr. Dinkins's chief corporate negotiators, said the Kidder, Peabody deal was considered particularly important because of the firm's prominence on Wall Street.
"From our perspective, Kidder is the last remaining large investment bank that was at risk" of leaving the city, he said. Several others, including Morgan Stanley and Company and Prudential Bache Securities, have accepted similar incentives from the city over the last two years after they, like Kidder, threatened to move to New Jersey or Connecticut.
In the case of Morgan Stanley, which threatened to move its Manhattan work force of 4,100 workers to Stamford, the Dinkins administration last year agreed to an incentive package worth $39.6 million.
 
Incentives Criticized
 Some officials, including Mark Green, the former Consumer Affairs Commissioner who is now the Democratic candidate for public advocate, have criticized the Mayor's use of incentives as a huge loss of future tax revenues in a game of corporate bluff with executives who may have no real intention of leaving Manhattan, particularly at a time when real estate prices have plummeted.
But that criticism has not become a major point of contention between the mayoral candidates. While Mr. Dinkins takes credit for saving jobs, Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly criticized the Mayor for allowing too many companies to leave, despite the city incentives.
Regardless of who wins Tuesday's election, no one expects large companies to stop seeking incentives from the city when their leases are due to expire.
But Mr. Weisbrod said yesterday that the incentives to keep Kidder, Peabody were well worth their price because the firm, along with other Wall Street giants that have been persuaded to stay, will bolster New York City's position as a global center of finance.
"By obtaining this commitment we have, in effect, assured our financial dominance well into the 21st century," he said.

HEADLINE: Two Ways to Run a City;
Mayoral Candidates Offer a Clear Choice Between Opposing Views of Government

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Beyond the questions of competence and temperament, crime and race, the 1993 campaign for mayor of New York City has offered voters two candidates with sharply different philosophies of local government.
David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani have not met this time in a debate to spell out those ideologies, and the campaign has often wandered into more visceral diversions. But the differences between the two men emerge with great clarity from their campaign statements, position papers and weeks of appearances in the five boroughs of the city. 
 Reared in New York City's Democratic Party, Mr. Dinkins, who is 66 years old, is in many ways a traditional New Deal liberal with an expansive vision of government. He speaks with pride of New York's Democratic heritage, stretching from Franklin D. Roosevelt. His associates say the Mayor remains firmly convinced that while liberal policies may have been rejected in other parts of the country, they are the very essence of what makes New York New York.
Mr. Giuliani, 49, models himself after Republican and centrist Democratic mayors who favor reducing government, encouraging competition and asking the poor to take more individual responsibility. Mr. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, says that New York can learn a lot from cities like Philadelphia or Indianapolis.
The race has even challenged a maxim of municipal politics: that there is no Democratic or Republican way to take out the garbage. Mr. Giuliani says that if as Mayor he could not persuade sanitation workers to change their work methods to insure an eight-hour day, then turning part of the Sanitation Department's work over to private collectors is an "option that you have to consider."
The clash of philosophies also extends into different visions of how a mayor should reach out to the multiethnic city: whether, like Mr. Dinkins, he should celebrate all the constituent parts of New York's "gorgeous mosaic" or, like Mr. Giuliani, call on New Yorkers to transcend race, gender, sexual preference and ideology and view their "common bonds."
The mayor of New York, of course, must operate within many restrictions. There are court orders, legislative mandates and fiscal constraints. He is required to balance the budget, which limits what even the most devoted liberal can spend on social problems. But even within the constraints, which both candidates acknowledge, they have found different approaches.
Mr. Dinkins spelled out his vision of government in his Inaugural Address in 1990. "This administration will renew the quest for social justice," he said that New Year's Day, when George Bush still controlled the White House. "We will speak out against national policies that offer cold indifference instead of compassion. And we will set our priorities to strengthen the weak, to help those who have been hurt, and to keep the middle class living in New York City."
In office, when economic recession and dire budgetary straits allowed, he has emphasized social activism by city government. His programs have been much more limited than he had envisioned in his last campaign, but he points with pride to the creation of programs to lower infant mortality and health-care clinics for the poor. He says the homeless have a right to housing. He hails a modest initiative to keep some schools around the city open on nights and weekends as the "21st-century version of settlement houses."
 
'Reinventing Government'
 Even his promised approach to job creation in a second term is activist government -- a municipal version of industrial policy, with the city using an economic development bank and venture capital funds to help industries grow.
Mr. Giuliani, a former Federal prosecutor, likes to point to experiments by fiscally conservative Mayors across the country in "reinventing government" by improving management, encouraging competition and contracting out government services.
Unlike Mr. Dinkins, Mr. Giuliani argues that the scope of government must be reconsidered to reduce the city's tax burden and because increases in federal aid are unlikely. He would seek to privatize three to four of the city's municipal hospitals. He has also said that Kennedy International Airport should be turned over to private concerns. He has pledged to cut roughly 35,000 jobs from the city work force over four years.
His approach to social programs is to try to encourage more individual responsibility, arguing that to do otherwise is to foster passivity in the name of compassion. He has proposed a 90-day limit on stays in homeless shelters for all but the "chronically homeless" to encourage people to seek other solutions to their lack of housing. He would also stop using the shelter system as a route toward city-provided apartments, saying such a system discourages the work ethic.
The two candidates also have significant philosophical differences on how government should relate to the racial, ethnic and sexual identities of its constituents.
Mr. Dinkins, who describes New York as a "gorgeous mosaic," has worked aggressively to bring minorities and women into government. "He's been taught by a lifetime to hate unfairness," begins one of his closing-stretch campaign commercials.
Mr. Dinkins created an affirmative-action program that directs 20 percent of the city's $3 billion in contracts to companies owned by women or minorities, even when their bids are as much as 10 percent higher than those of other companies.
 
Promoting Diversity
 And the city's first black Mayor speaks proudly of the diversity of his City Hall. "The way he constructed the administration there are more women, Latinos, lesbians and gays, and African-Americans in city government than there were under any mayor ever," said Andrea Bernstein, Mr. Dinkins's deputy campaign manager.
"Our argument is unless you are willing to face the fact that this is a diverse, multicultural city and deal with that, you'll never be able to correct historical inequalities," she said.
Mr. Giuliani's approach embraces the critique by neoconservative commentators of what they have described as a wave of "political correctness" sweeping the nation's campuses and cultural life. Such writers have argued that the nation, once a melting pot, is being torn asunder by "identity politics" in which racial minorities, women and homosexuals proclaim group identities as separate from and victimized by the majority culture. The commentators have also contended that ideological intolerance by members of such groups has stopped political debate.
For months, Mr. Giuliani has called on his audiences to look at their "common bonds" as New Yorkers, with common concerns about schools and safety. "We have to also look at the things that make us the same," he has said, over and over.
 
Appointments on Merit
 Mr. Giuliani says he would "work hard" to make his administration representative of the city, but he also says he would make appointments on merit, "irrespective of race, religion, ethnic background, sexual orientation."
"Right now in the city administration," he said at a campaign appearance this week, "it appears as if the principal reason why people are selected is symbolic. The principal reason is to create a representative government rather than to select the most talented person."
He opposes the city's affirmative-action program for women and minority contractors, contending that City Hall should not subsidize the contractors if they cannot be as cost-efficient as their competitors. He would instead create development banks as another way to help minority businesses.
Whoever wins next Tuesday will be based on many imponderables, including Mr. Dinkins's record, Mr. Giuliani's image, the racial identification of the voters, and which campaign best gets out the vote. But it may also have a lot to do with which candidate has a better philosophical reading of New York.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Brewer Revives a European Tradition in Texas

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
Pierre Celis is about to prove you can go home again. The 68-year-old Belgian brewer, who sold his brewery in Belgium to a giant brewer several years ago, has been making beer in Texas for the last year and a half. Now, he is going to sell beer in Belgium once again.
Regardless of whether his beers should be classified as Belgian-style Texas beer or Texas-style Belgian beer, there is no question that Mr. Celis, a Ross Perot-size man who often wears a bolo tie, has carved out a niche for himself in the beer business. He has sucessfully established himself as one of the leaders in the growing international taste for white, or wheat, beer. 
 Celis beers, made in a small new brewery in Austin, are sold widely in the United States. But in November, Celis White Austin Texas Beer will be made and sold in Belgium. So no one gets the wrong idea about where Mr. Celis's loyalties lie, the label shows a cowboy wrangling a longhorn, an attention-getter for a country where beers are often made in monasteries.
 
Light, Fruity Beer
 White beers, known as wheat beers because of the high percentage of wheat in the mash, are traditionally light and fruity. They recently have been rediscovered in Germany and Belgium, and have caught the fancy of America's boutique brewers. In the Bavarian region of Germany, wheat beers account for 30 percent of all beer sold. Belgium now has 15 brands, up from none in 1966.
In America, nearly half of all microbreweries are making wheat beer, especially in the West, said David Edgar, the assistant director of the Institute for Brewing Studies in Denver. Wheat beers account for about 10 percent of America's microbrewery production of about one million barrels with some well-known brands like Samuel Adams and August Schell in wide distribution.
America's biggest brewers have not been much for wheat. In the mid-80's the Miller Brewing Company test-marketed a German-style wheat beer called Dakota, but found consumers were not interested and dropped it.
But last summer, Garrett Oliver, the owner of Manhattan Brewing Company in SoHo, introduced a cloudy, unfiltered wheat beer and "it's taken off like a rocket," he said. "People are very curious about it."
 
Made for Centuries

 In Belgium the pale, milky-looking white beers, known as witbiers, were made for centuries, especially in and around the town of Hoegaarden (pronounced who-garden), near Liege, where Mr. Celis lived. But the beer went out of style, and by 1957 the town's last brewer of white beer closed and sold his equipment to a museum.
"In those days people wanted big new brand names, not these old-fashioned products," Mr. Celis said.
Then came the hot summer of 1966, finding Mr. Celis, who had gone into his father's livestock and dairy business, lamenting the disappearance of white beer, which is often considered summer beer because of its refreshing flavor. "When I was growing up I had worked in that brewery and I really knew what was involved in making the beer, so I decided to try to make some myself," he said.
 
'A Substantial Investment'
 He produced 100 liters of the beer, which is made with roughly equal parts of wheat and barley and also seasoned with coriander and bitter orange peel. (Wheat beers are never made entirely from wheat.)
Mr. Celis gave samples to neighbors who liked it and encouraged him. "At that point I got nervous," he said. "To continue meant making a substantial investment."
With about $10,000, he bought a small brewery and began producing 20 barrels a year. "I had success so I became more daring," he said.
By 1978 he had bought a former lemonade factory with two Dutch partners, and after converting it into a brewery, he tripled production of his Hoegaarden white beer.
Then, in 1985 the brewery was destroyed by fire. It would take the equivalent of $10 million to rebuild. "We were not well insured," he said.
 
Found Willing Backer
 But he found a willing backer in Interbrew, the giant Belgian brewer that owns Stella Artois and several other brands and commands a 1.4 percent share of the global market, according to Impact, a research service for the beverage industry. (The Anheuser-Busch Companies is the leader with a 9 percent share.)
Mr. Celis sold the brewery but his contract -- for a seven-figure sum he will not disclose -- required him to remain with Interbrew until 1990, by which time the new brewery was producing 300,000 barrels a year and was one of 15 Belgian breweries making white beer.
"When I started, it was just me and my wife, Juliette," he said. "And we conquered the world." But conqueror or not, Mr. Celis was by no means ready for an easy chair. "Selling the brewery was a crisis for me," he said.
 
Seven Acres in Texas
 His daughter, Christine, who had worked in the brewery, and his son-in-law, Peter Camps, who was also a brewer, wanted to try to make Belgian-style beer in America. The Celises knew some people in Texas, so they settled in Austin. They bought seven acres of land for $13 million and built their Texas brewery.
"America is a big market," Mr. Celis said, "but it's difficult." For a brief period he had tried to export his Belgian white beer to America, but it was too expensive. "You can't sell much beer if you have to charge $9 or $10 for a six-pack," he said.
Last year, the brewery started by making Celis White, plus a rich and hearty pale bock and a Pilsener-style golden beer. Grand Cru, a creamy, fruity ale, was added last December.
Sandy Monblatt, whose company, Sanford Trading of Sausalito, Calif., distributes Celis beers on the West Coast, said the white beer is acquiring a small but loyal following that is growing. "It will take time," he said. "People have to taste the beer to understand it."
 
Daughter Steps In
 Last year when a group of 65 Belgian brewers visited the brewery in Austin, they suggested that Mr. Celis export his beer to Belgium. "That was out of the question," Mr. Celis said, "because of the 40 percent tax imposed on American products by the European Economic Community." So his daughter arranged for a Belgian brewery to make it under license.
Surprisingly, his agreement with Interbrew did not prevent him from making beer in Belgium again. "Interbrew can't be happy about it, but there's nothing they can do to stop us," he said.

HEADLINE: Campaign Stop: A periodic report on neighborhood reaction to the mayoral race. -- 5. Morris Heights;
Dinkins Supporters Stay the Course

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER

 BODY:
Christopher Kennedy's face registered nothing as the crack of four gunshots, perhaps a block away, echoed off the rain-dampened brick of his apartment building on University Avenue in the Bronx. He just looked up the street as he waited in the drizzle for the school bus to drop off his 9-year-old stepdaughter.
"Minorities are suffering," he said, flicking his cigarette to the sidewalk. "We're suffering a lot." 
 That is why, he said, he intends to vote for Mayor David N. Dinkins. More than Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Dinkins understands the plight of the poor, Mr. Kennedy said, even if his performance has not been all that many people expected four years ago.
"Rome wasn't built in a day," Mr. Kennedy said. "So you've got to give him a little bit of time."
 
The Clear Favorite
 In Morris Heights, a poor neighborhood but by no means the city's poorest, Mr. Dinkins is the clear favorite. For some voters in this black and Hispanic area, the reason is straightforward: Mr. Dinkins is the city's first black Mayor and his opponent is white. For others, the choice has other dimensions because poorer neighborhoods rely heavily on government programs, from welfare to condominium conversions for middle-income families to programs for the handicapped. In interviews, Mr. Giuliani was often described as an enemy on these issues and Mr. Dinkins as a friend.
Support for Mr. Dinkins here appears unshakable; only one person among the dozen interviewed was planning to vote for Mr. Giuliani. The imperative for Mr. Dinkins in neighborhoods like Morris Heights, where the percentage of registered voters is extremely low, is quantity, to try to swing a tight election: how many people will turn out next Tuesday?
 
Dinkins Got 90% in 1989
 Four years ago, 90 percent of the vote in this census tract -- No. 245, which runs from Sedgwick Avenue east to University Avenue, from West 180th Street south to West Tremont Avenue -- went to Mr. Dinkins. Voter turnout was 61 percent, above the city average of 55 percent, and atypically high for a poor neighborhood.
The Dinkins campaign staff intends to get out the vote by making phone calls and even going door to door in areas like Morris Heights, where the percentage of registered voters in 1989 was extremely low, only 25 percent of the voting-age population. That figure was not expected to be much higher this time, since registration rolls have barely moved. The city average in 1989 was 56 percent, with some neighborhoods substantially higher.
Based on interviews in this census district, there appear to be at least some registered voters who do not intend cast a ballot this year.
"It's just the same thing over and over again," said Reginald Robinson, 25, who is unemployed but who is working on making a film about women in the armed services. "Each candidate bickers with each other about what changes they are going to make. But there are no changes. It's all talk."
 
Changes for the Better
 Even though skepticism has made inroads here, many residents said they had seen significant and positive changes, and offered them as reasons to vote for Mr. Dinkins.
Renovated buildings containing a check cashing place, a new grocery store and many apartments have replaced the blackened shells that stood for years along Burnside Avenue and other streets. The drug trade is still potent but has thinned out as community policing has begun to take effect. Gunfire is less frequent, despite the shots Mr. Kennedy heard. Mr. Dinkins deserves credit, residents said, even if some initiatives come from the state or Washington or began before he took office.
"There are any number of houses that have been renovated and redone under his administration," said the Rev. A. B. Duncans, 75, who has led efforts to clear his street, West 179th Street, and others of drug dealers. "There is a hope of the neighborhood coming back to where it was when I first came."
Few people said they were undecided, and only one woman said she would vote Mr. Giuliani. The woman, who would not give her name, lives in a four-room city-subsidized apartment and she is outraged that her rent has risen from $219 a month a few years ago to $400.
"It's too much money," she said. Of Mr. Giuliani, she said, "They say he looks O.K., that he is going to do better things for the people. I hope he doesn't raise things, make everything go too high."
 
Government Help
 Around Morris Heights many people mentioned programs or other help that they, their family or friends received from the government as a reason to vote for Mr. Dinkins, even in cases when the money came from sources other than city government. Alice Baez Lozada, 36, was thrilled by the construction of a wheelchair ramp in a local city park and improvements in bus service for her 20-year-old son, Edgar, who suffers from cerebral palsy.
Janet Barrett, 34, has lupus and began receiving Medicaid after her insurance ran out a year and a half ago. Lillian Rodriguez, 42, a single mother of four children and two foster children, bought her apartment on West Burnside Avenue after the city converted it into cooperatives and replaced the ceilings and windows and installed a new intercom system.
Ms. Rodriguez intends to vote for Mr. Dinkins, but not without some reservations.
"He could have done much better," she said. "He is a black Mayor and he should have done more to stop the racial problems and the corruption. But if they give him another chance I think he will make it."
As far as Mr. Giuliani is concerned, she and many others simply doubted that he cared about minorities or the poor. "I think he is going to take a lot out of poor people," she said. "He does show less compassion for us people. He doesn't seem like he wants to give."
 
Invigorated by Dinkins
 Many residents who said they supported Mr. Dinkins felt invigorated by his election as New York City's first black Mayor. There was a sense that white New Yorkers have been too quick to judge Mr. Dinkins, who they say has looked out for their interests, even when they could not name instances in which he helped them or their neighborhood.
"I felt a black mayor would give more thought to black people than a white person," said Kenneth Jones, a 37-year-old cook at Harlem Hospital, explaining his vote for Mr. Dinkins four years ago.
Four years later, Mr. Jones said he is not disappointed, though he acknowledged that Mr. Dinkins has not solved the city's most pressing problems of crime, poverty and poor relations between the races. "He did what he could do," he said, echoing the opinion of many in Morris Heights. "The city was so messed up to start with. You can't do everything in four years. I think he cares more. He knows what we are up against, the black people."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes With Gains After Weakness at Opening

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar ended firmer against other currencies yesterday, recovering from a shaky start after a steep decline on Thursday.
The selloff on Thursday "confused people at first, but then we saw a resumption of the dollar's bullish trend," said William Arnold, Chemical Banking Corporation's chief dealer and vice president for global securities foreign exchange. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.6858 German marks from 1.6740 marks on Thursday. It also rose to 108.65 Japanese yen, from 108.17 yen.
Gold prices were slightly lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery declined 60 cents, to $369.60 an ounce.
Dealers noted that the dollar's gains were made almost entirely on a midafternoon flurry of buying, exaggerated by extremely thin volume. "This week's volatility gave many people an opportunity to lose money," said Richard Vullo, a Bank of Montreal corporate dealer. "People didn't need excuses to take a breath."
Another dealer said there was "a short squeeze on a very quiet afternoon." This meant that traders who had sold dollars in anticipation of buying them back at a lower price were forced to cover those short positions as the dollar instead rose in value.
Some currency traders stayed out of the market yesterday in advance of a holiday weekend in Europe. Several European markets will be closed on Monday in observance of All Saints' Day.
Reports yesterday on the American economy had limited effect on the dollar in early trading.
The Chicago Purchasing Management Index for October, which rose to 57 percent from 54.5 percent in September, exceeded market expectations, but did not set off a rally in the dollar's exchange price.
And the Government reported that September personal income and spending rose two-tenths and three-tenths of a percent, respectively, roughly in line with forecasts.
Dealers said the University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment, which traders said rose to 82.7 in its final October report, from 77.9 for September, got a mixed reception.
"The month-to-month increase was good, but the final October number was not as strong as some interim numbers," said Michael McKeaver at Fuji Bank.

HEADLINE: Cost Curbs Help Macy Cut Losses

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
R. H. Macy & Company, which operates the Macy's, Bullock's and I. Magnin store chains, tripled its cash flow in September by keeping a tight rein on expenses, according to documents filed in United States Bankruptcy Court yesterday.
The company almost broke even last month, posting a $600,000 operating loss compared with an $18.8 million loss in the corresponding period last year. Sales, however, dipped slightly as the company continued to struggle against weak economies in California and the Northeast, where it has the most stores. 
 Macy has been operating under bankruptcy protection since January 1992.
"Clearly the aggressive steps we have been taking to restructure our operations and systems and to reduce expenses are now beginning to have their desired effect," Myron E. Ullman 3d, Macy's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
The company's junk bonds traded at their highest levels in more than a year yesterday, with the most senior class of bonds trading at $41 at one point during the day.
 
Topped Its Own Goal
 For the fiscal year that ended on July 31, the company topped its own goal with $210.1 million in cash flow, in contrast to a negative cash flow of $38.9 million in fiscal 1992, year-end documents show. Macy had earlier predicted its 1993 cash flow would be $204 million.
"The year-over-year swing in operating cash flow is impressive and indicates significant progress in profit margin improvement and expenses," said David H. Ford, senior analyst at the Delaware Bay Company.
Sales declined 2.3 percent in fiscal 1993, to $6.3 billion, in part because Macy closed stores and eliminated much of its consumer electronics business. At stores open for at least a year, sales rose 1.7 percent in 1993.
The improvement in Macy's business, in contrast to the sales slippage, shows how far the company has pared its costs. In September, for example, its expenses decreased 19 percent. Had the company not cut costs so drastically, its cash flow last month would have been less than in the same period last year.
 
Cost Control a Top Priority
 "Controlling their costs was their No. 1 priority, and they're proving they can do that," said Jack Hersh, director of research at M. J. Whitman L.P., which trades distressed securities.
Despite its progress, Macy is not likely to emerge from bankruptcy before the spring of 1995.
"They've laid the path for improved performance this year, but I don't anticipate them coming out of bankruptcy any earlier than 1995," said Walter F. Loeb, president of Loeb Associates Inc., a retail consulting firm.
But many players in the junk bond market are keeping an eye on next March, when Macy's period of exclusivity -- the period in which it alone can present a plan of reorganization to its creditors -- will be up. At that time, some creditors who hold its bank debt and senior bonds might try to push the company out of bankruptcy before 1995 because they would be more likely to receive equity, and a stake in Macy's future, in an early reorganization.
Most analysts say, however, that the judge presiding over the Macy bankruptcy will probably just extend the period of exclusivity.

HEADLINE: Advice for a Fraction of the Price of a Personalized Plan

 BODY:
Can't afford a financial planner? With planners' bills often reaching thousands of dollars, the problem is hardly rare. Luckily, alternatives exist.
The telephone is one option. For $3.95 a minute, a caller to 800 ASK-A-CPA can get financial advice from an accountant or certified financial planner. "We want people to call us back and back and back, so we try to answer questions as quickly as possible," said John Howland, a partner in the venture, called Money Minds of Glenview, Ill. 
 Along with telephone advice, Money Minds offers written financial plans. For $495, a customer will receive a complete plan plus a year of unlimited phone consultations.
Economy-minded clients can find good deals with in-person planners, too. "Sometimes, a planner will sit down with you on a one-time basis for a few hours and get you on the right financial track," said Barbara Roper of the Consumer Federation of America. The cost, a few hundred dollars, is about the same as some seminars.
"We've done seminars for groups at $250 or $300 per person for two four-hour sessions," said Lyle K. Benson, an accountant and planner at Coyne & McClean in Baltimore. "It provides the basic tools."
While often valuable, seminars are also "the way many con artists work," Ms. Roper warned. Even if no fraud is involved, such courses may be used for sales pitches. If the speaker spends undue time touting particular products, beware, she said.
If you have some discipline, books by reputable authors like Andrew Tobias and Jane Bryant Quinn are very good, Ms. Roper said. Mr. Benson said that computer programs, including Quicken, serve well, too.
Want something for nothing? Good sources of material are large no-load mutual fund familiies and many state cooperative extension services.

HEADLINE: INSURANCE;
Confusion Over Policies Leads to Talk of Change

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:
BUYERS of life insurance are entitled to descriptions of their policies and how they work. But the computer-generated tables supplied by insurance agents often show results that are just not realistic.
Even after scouring these documents, people frequently cannot determine what the policies' benefits would be if they lived, died or stopped paying premiums at any given time. 
 "People are buying the wrong things," said J. Robert Hunter, the president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, who is about to become the Texas Insurance Commissioner. "That's because the disclosures are incredibly arcane and easy to manipulate."
After a long period of consumer complaints, Congressional hearings and industry reports on the insurance tables, widely known as illustrations, state regulators are preparing to take action. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners intends to adopt by March disclosure guidelines for illustrations that the states can use as a model to create their own laws.
At least until new laws are enacted, shopping for life insurance will remain difficult. "It's absolutely buyer beware," said Mary Griffin, insurance counsel for Consumers Union. "And the past couple of years have gotten worse."
Insurance companies have been using illustrations for many years to sell life insurance policies, which essentially are complex long-term financial instruments. The illustrations list death benefits and cash values over time making specific interest rate assumptions. And those assumptions account for much of the confusion.
For example, an illustration from one company might assume a 10 percent annual rate of return, which was common in the 1980's but is unlikely in the near future. An illustration from another company might assume a different rate of return.
While acknowledging some abuses in illustrations, insurers and actuaries say buyers often misunderstand what is being presented to them. "Life insurance is not like a bank account where you know what the interest rate is going to be," said Judy Faucett, a partner in Coopers & Lybrand and chairwoman of the task force on illustrations for the American Academy of Actuaries. "An illustration is not a guarantee, or even a best estimate, of how that policy is going to look in 20 years."
Walter Miller, vice president of the Prudential Insurance Company of America, said: "Illustrations are not predictions. But they are better than no illustration at all in explaining how policies work."
Critics say a major problem with illustrations is inappropriate comparisons of the performance of different policies. That is because no two companies define their interest earnings, mortality experience and expenses exactly the same way. Other problems are no standard format and inadequate policy descriptions.
Four principal solutions to these problems have been proposed: standardizing assumptions about investment return, prohibiting growth projections, creating a uniform policy design and adopting penalties for misleading the consumer.
"People are literally taking on risks when they buy a policy and they have no idea of the extent of those risks," said Joseph M. Belth, editor of the Insurance Forum newsletter. "Maybe the time has come for a prospectus-type disclosure of those risks." As used in the mutual fund industry, a prospectus would publish figures on historical performance, rather than project into the future.
Mr. Belth said: "First, there must be disclosure to the buyer at the point of sale. Second, there must be periodic, continuing disclosure to the policyholder, preferably once a year."

HEADLINE: Q & A

BYLINE: Leonard Sloane

 BODY:

Savings Bond Changes
 
Q. Will the reduction in interest from 6 percent to 4 percent on series E savings bonds affect the original interest on a bond purchased 15 or more years ago?
STANLEY LIKOFF, Bellerose, L.I.
 
A. The original interest on your bond was not affected, but interest earned afterward may be. The change in the guaranteed minimum rate for United States Savings Bonds affects bonds bought after March 1 and bonds entering new extension periods after that date.
The interest you receive on a bond depends on its issue date. Assuming you bought a bond in October 1978, the rate was fixed for the first five years, after which it went into a 10-year extension period, in which interest was paid on a variable-rate basis. The guaranteed rate for the current extension period is 4 percent, but you may get more if the market-based average rate is higher.
"If you hold the bond long enough, it will enter another extension period at the 25-year point," said Richard J. Schneebeli, deputy director of the Savings Bond division of the Treasury Department. "It will then earn the guaranteed minimum rate or the market-based variable rate prevailing at that time, whichever is higher."
 
Taxes on Noncitizens
 
Q. My husband and I are legal residents but not United States citizens. What Federal gift and estate taxes apply to us?
ROSEMARY WEBER, Manhasset, L.I.
 
A. Most gift and estate tax rules apply to both citizen and noncitizen residents. The same tax rates apply, and the first $600,000 in an estate is exempt from Federal estate tax. An important exception, however, is that transfers to a noncitizen spouse do not automatically qualify for the unlimited marital deduction on estate taxes. Such gifts are limited to $100,000 annually.
"If you are married to a noncitizen, you should consider including in your will a qualified domestic trust that will be eligible for the estate tax marital deduction," said Robert W. Benjamin, a partner in the New York law firm of Esanu Katsky Korins & Siger. "If all else fails, the surviving spouse will have a short grace period either to reform the will in court or to become a U.S. citizen."
 
I.R.A. Cutoff Point
 
Q. Can one, working during the year he or she turns 70 1/2, make a deductible contribution to an I.R.A., while at the same time becoming subject to I.R.A. withdrawal requirements?
BERNARD MOSS, Washington
 
A. Taxpayers who work, but who do not participate in their employer's retirement plan, can make tax-deductible contributions of up to $2,000 a year to an individual retirement account.
But beginning with the year in which a taxpayer reaches 70 1/2, tax-deductible contributions can no longer be made to an I.R.A. by or for the benefit of that taxpayer.
"There are also special rules allowing a married working taxpayer to make tax-deductible contributions to an I.R.A. for the benefit of his or her spouse, even if the taxpayer is over age 70 1/2," said Jerry Uslander, a principal of William M. Mercer Inc., a New York employee benefits consultancy. "This deduction ceases once the spouse reaches age 70 1/2, no matter what the age of the taxpayer."

HEADLINE: Canada's Quarrel With Nafta

 BODY:
Supporters of the North American Free Trade Agreement hoped that the Liberal Party, once it won the Canadian elections, would drop its vow to renegotiate the trade pact. But this week Jean Chretien, the Prime Minister-elect, resurrected the threat. That's unfortunate, because renegotiation could bury Nafta -- an important pact that would raise living standards in Canada, Mexico and the U.S. and lock Mexico into its pro-market reforms. The threat is also unnecessary, because Nafta doesn't bear on the trade issues that disturb Mr. Chretien the most.
The dispute is mostly about subsidies the Canadian Government gives industries like wheat and lumber. These subsidies are designed to solve domestic problems, like bailing out flagging industries and developing downtrodden regions. But the two countries' economies are so intertwined that domestic subsidies inevitably affect trade between them. Subsidies help Canadian producers lower their prices, giving exporters an "unfair advantage," according to their U.S. competitors. 
 Under existing trade rules, the U.S. -- after finding that subsidies have materially injured domestic producers -- can impose offsetting taxes, known as countervailing duties, on the offending imports. Canada has challenged U.S. actions and has often persuaded a dispute panel to throw out the countervailing duties. But Mr. Chretien wants more protection, perhaps some kind of immunity from retaliation.
It's a difficult dispute to resolve, because both countries have behaved responsibly, yet each feels wounded. Fortunately, there may be a way out. The draft accord from the Uruguay Round of international trade talks would permit countries to provide general subsidies to industries located in poor regions without fear of retaliation. The U.S. has already embraced this provision. The two countries should be able to adopt a similar provision, even without a formal Uruguay agreement and without holding up Nafta.
Canadian pressure could hand American consumers a big victory. U.S. Administrations, bowing to industry, have often brought charges of unfair trade practices where none exist. If Canada compels the U.S. to retaliate only when justified, then more foreign goods will enter the U.S., driving down prices. For consumers, that's like having Washington deposit a big check in their bank accounts.
Nafta doesn't address the unfair-trade issues that Mr. Chretien wants resolved. And the accord should not be derailed by such ancillary disputes. The solution to the subsidies dispute is hard negotiations. Nafta doesn't preclude such negotiations and should not be held hostage to their resolution.

HEADLINE: Teachers Union Acts Shamefully to Mayor;
Not Race Alone

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I concur with the thrust of "Clinton Spoke the Truth on Race" by Lani Guinier (Op-Ed, Oct. 19), that honest discourse is essential to improving relations between our citizens.
Yet, when we limit any type of discourse on race to black and white, we omit other real elements of difference that contribute to this crisis: age, gender, social and economic status, sexual preference, physical ability, ethnicity and religious affiliation. 
 The question history is waiting for our nation to answer is whether or not citizens of varying backgrounds, life styles and beliefs can look beyond those differences to fulfill the principles of freedom, justice and equality. In answering this question, each one of us has a stake and responsibility in making this a world where a person is judged by the content of his or her character.

HEADLINE: David Gergen, Master of THE GAME

BYLINE: By Michael Kelly. 
Michael Kelly is the staff writer of The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
On Nov. 9, 1960, the day after John F. Kennedy defeated Richard M. Nixon to become the 35th President of the United States, a reporter for The Washington Daily News and a reporter for The Associated Press dropped by Nixon's house in Washington, looking for a interview with the loser. The Vice President answered the door himself, and standing on the front stoop, the three men settled into a polite routine of questions and answers. Suddenly, Pat Nixon appeared. She was angry and, it was clear, not in control of her emotions. She damned the reporters and their colleagues for favoritism toward Kennedy that she said cost her husband the election. Nixon calmed her and led her away. When he returned, he said nothing about his wife's outburst, and the reporters resumed their inquiry as if nothing unusual had occurred. Neither reporter ever wrote about Mrs. Nixon's behavior; it wasn't news. 
 This small, oddly dignified scene, remembered by one of the reporters, belongs to a world that has vanished utterly. A journalist interviewing the losing candidate on the day after the 1992 election would have done so as a member of a large pack, covering a set piece of political theater -- a media event, as it is called. The event would have been scripted down to the level of minor jokes, in an effort to insure that the candidate committed no gaffes before the cameras. The reporters, hoping to shake things off-script, and aware of their own video presence, would have shouted self-consciously aggressive questions. Had the defeated candidate's wife interrupted to scold the press, this would have been regarded by his handlers as a calamity (unless they had secretly arranged it) and by the reporters as the news of the day. 
 The story of this vast change is the story of how the idea of image became the faith of Washington, and how the President became the central figure of that faith, the architect and ultimately the victim of the world's most elaborate personality cult.
 In this new faith, it has come to be held that what sort of person a politician actually is and what he actually does are not really important. What is important is the perceived image of what he is and what he does. Politics is not about objective reality, but virtual reality. What happens in the political world is divorced from the real world. It exists for only the fleeting historical moment, in a magical movie of sorts, a never-ending and infinitely revisable docudrama. Strangely, the faithful understand that the movie is not true -- yet also maintain that it is the only truth that really matters.
 By the time Bill Clinton was elected the 42d President of the United States, the culture of Washington (and therefore of governance and politics) had become dominated by people professionally involved in creating the public images of elected officials. They hold various jobs -- they are pollsters, news-media consultants, campaign strategists, advertising producers, political scientists, reporters, columnists, commentators -- but the making of the movie is their shared concern. They are parts of a product-based cultural whole, just like the citizens of Beverly Hills. Some are actors, some are directors, some are scriptwriters and some are critics, but they are all in the same line of work and life. They go to the same parties, send their children to the same schools, live in the same neighborhoods. They interview each other, argue with each other, sleep with each other, marry each other, live and die by each other's judgment. They joust and josh on television together, and get rich together explaining Washington to conventions of doctors and lawyers and corporate executives.
 Not surprisingly, they tend to believe the same things at the same time. They believe in polls. They believe in television; they believe in talk; they believe, most profoundly, in talk television. They believe in irony. They believe that nothing a politician does in public can be taken at face value, but that everything he does is a metaphor for something he is hiding. They believe in the extraordinary! disastrous! magnificent! scandalous! truth of whatever it is they believe in at the moment. Above all, they believe in the power of what they have created, in the subjectivity of reality and the reality of perceptions, in image.
 The growth of the faith of image has had a gradual but cumulatively momentous effect. It has made the old distinctions of profession and ideology that had defined the culture of Washington seem outdated and naive, like the blushingly remembered fervors of adolescence. If the reality of an action is defined by the public presentation of the action, then what is a television reporter but an actor? What is a newspaper writer but a theater critic? If the truth of an idea is defined by its advertising campaign, who but a mug can seriously believe in one set of ideas or another? If perception is reality, what is the point of any differences at all -- between Republicans and Democrats, between journalists and Government officials, between ideologues and copywriters, between the chatterers of television and the thinkers of the academy, between Washington and Hollywood?
 Indeed, the differences have become harder and harder to see. Yesterday's reporter is today's White House spokesman is tomorrow's pundit. On the Sunday talk shows, the celebrity host and the celebrity reporter and the celebrity political strategist sit side by side, and the distinctions between them are not apparent to the naked eye. In effect, they are one, members of the faith, the stars of a culture they themselves have created. Indeed, they have acknowledged their oneness. They have given themselves a name, the Insiders, and a language.
 The language reveals, as all languages do, a great deal about how its speakers see themselves and the world. It is self-referential, self-important, self-mocking and very nearly (if subconsciously) self-loathing. It is deeply cynical. It portrays a society where to be knowing is to admit the fraud of one's functions in the act of performing them.
 This is how the Insiders describe the passage of a day:
 The day is composed, not of hours or minutes, but of news cycles. In each cycle, senior White House officials speaking on background define the line of the day. The line is echoed and amplified outside the Beltway to real people, who live out there, by the President's surrogates, whose appearances create actualities (on radio) and talking heads (on television). During the rollout of a new policy, the President, coached by his handlers and working from talking points and briefing books churned out by war room aides, may permit his own head to talk. There are various ways in which he might do this, ranging from the simplest photo op to a one on one with a media big-foot, to the more elaborately orchestrated media hit (perhaps an impromptu with real people) to the full-fledged spectacle of a town hall.
 The line, a subunit of the Administration's thematic message, is reinforced by leaks and plants and massaged through the care and feeding of the press. It is adjusted by spin patrol and corrected through damage control when mistakes are made or gaffes are committed that take attention off-message and can create a dreaded feeding frenzy. Reaction to the line is an important part of the cycle, and it comes primarily from Congressional leaders of both parties, the strange-sounding biparts, whose staff-written utterances are often delivered directly to media outlets via fax attacks. The result of all this activity passes through the media filter, where it is cut into tiny, easily digestible sound bites and fed to already overstuffed pundits, who deliver the ultimate product of the entire process, a new piece of conventional wisdom.
 Every species produces its perfect flower and every culture its perfect moment. In the late spring of 1993, the perfect flower of the insider species and the perfect moment of the image culture met in the Presidential appointment of David R. Gergen, Washington's circular man.
 The career of David Gergen represents the triumph of image. The character of David Gergen represents the apotheosis of the insider. The two are rolled up in him together, in a shining, seamless roundness whose mirrored surface reveals nothing but the political scene rolling by. In himself, Gergen has conflated all the old distinctions. Over the course of 22 years, he has traveled from White House to White House, from Government to journalism to punditry and now back to Government (and soon enough, you may bet on it, back to journalism again), from the Democratic camp to the Republican to the Independent to the Democratic again. So perfectly is he of his time and place and class that he is himself part of the tribal language. To be Gergenized is to be spun by the velveteen hum of this soothing man's smoothing voice into a state of such vertigo that the sense of what is real disappears into a blur. Nothing is more Gergenized than Gergen himself. The blur is the man. He is his own magic movie, forever revising the reality of himself.
 On May 29, David Gergen was appointed counselor to the new President, a Democrat. The move surprised many who had known Gergen as a servant of three Republican Presidents, including one -- Ronald Reagan -- whom the new President had charged with ruining America. Actually, Gergen hastened to say with bland audacity: "I'm not a Republican. I've always been a registered Independent."
 On June 7, standing at the podium in the White House press room where he had often spoken on behalf of Republican Presidents, Gergen was asked to define his politics more fully. His answer was marvelous for its accidental revelation of the heart of the man. When he first went to work for Richard Nixon in 1971, he had been a registered Democrat. Later, under Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan, he had voted Republican, worked in Republican political campaigns and served as the public defender of Republican policies. But he characterized this as a matter more sartorial than ideological: "wearing Republican cloth." Leaving the Reagan White House in 1984 to begin a career at the more rarefied levels of journalism (a fellowship at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, a stint as editor and later as columnist for U.S. News & World Report, and a regular spot as a commentator on "The MacNeil/ Lehrer Newshour"), he had "thought it was important" that he "not be seen as a, quote, 'Republican.' " And so he had "evolved" into "an independent voice" that was "moderately right of center."
 In most places, this sort of performance could win one a reputation for opportunism. It does that in Washington too, but here the tag is meant as a compliment. Possessing a large degree of what the Washington columnist and talk-television star Michael Kinsley has called "intellectual, uh, flexibility" is no sin here. Wrong lies in the opposite direction, in the gaucherie of displaying passionately held convictions. (Stage passion is fine, but it is crucial to know the difference. The real anger displayed by the Republican strategist Mary Matalin during the 1992 Presidential campaign was considered such a breach of manners that her boss, the deep-insider George Bush, forced her to apologize. Meanwhile, the faux tantrums of Matalin's boyfriend, the Democratic strategist James Carville, won him admiring fame.) A man like Gergen, unafraid to admit that his loyalties and convictions are no more than outerwear, is always welcome at the table.
 The moment that proved this true -- the perfect flower's perfect moment -- occurred on the evening of June 4, and of course on television. The scene was the set of "The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour," the insider's evening news, where reasonable men and women meet to mostly agree and occasionally agree to disagree (in the mildest possible manner). Until his latest Presidential appointment, Gergen had been a weekly guest on the show, playing (barely) conservative to the columnist Mark Shields's (barely) liberal, a relationship whose evident amiability was never once threatened by even a hint of strong disagreement.
 This evening's program focused on two related Presidential events of the past week: the public relations disaster of Lani Guinier's abandoned appointment to head of the Justice Department's civil rights division and the hiring of the public relations impresario David Gergen.
 Who did MacNeil/Lehrer invite to assess the impact of Guinier and Gergen? Who but, as host Robert MacNeil put it, a man who was until recently "a weekly analyst here on the Newshour . . . here tonight in his new role . . . David Gergen, news maker."
 After interviewing Gergen on Guinier and Gergen on Gergen (he was modest and judicious on both subjects), MacNeil bade the news maker goodbye and introduced the show's political panel, which appeared minus the regular guest . . . David Gergen.
 Once the panel host, Roger Mudd, had finished a bland discussion of the Guinier mess, he then turned to a subject of more intimate concern, the White House appointment of . . . David Gergen.
 "Well, I wish David Gergen hadn't done it," said the conservative commentator Linda Chavez. "Because he's a friend of mine. Who would wish this job on anybody?"
 The liberal commentator Eddie Williams chimed in: "I dropped him a note saying I congratulated him on what I felt was a fantastic match, my words, the match between Gergen and Clinton."
 Added Shields: "Let me tell you what David Gergen brings, I think, to Bill Clinton. . . . He has that ability to come in and speak the truth."
 At which point, Mudd turned to face the table to Shields's right, and reintroduced . . . David Gergen.
 "Did you realize he's been sitting, listening to us the whole time?" Mudd asked, as the director switched cameras to show Gergen there at the table, laughing, grinning slyly, from under his long, pale blond eyelashes, as if to say: Aren't we naughty? And everyone else, Williams and Chavez and Shields and Mudd, was smiling and laughing, too. The joke was, really, delightful. The whole time they had been discussing Gergen, acting as if they were trying to give an honest appraisal of the man -- why, he had been right there sitting among his pals. How delicious (how perfect) to admit that it was all just a great big shucks, that it didn't matter where Gergen sat or whom he worked for at the moment, that he and they were in on it together and that only those saps out there, outside the beltway, were dumb enough to think it was for real.
 Oddly enough, no one knows better what is wrong with all this than David Gergen. It is a dislocating experience to hear him -- this former Nixon speech writer, this former Reagan director of communications, this man who has spent the larger part of his adult life building the images of Presidents and of himself, this insider so dedicated to the insider's art of leaking that old colleagues call him the Sieve -- as he disdains and regrets his life's work.
 "So often now, Presidents are being judged, politicians are being judged by the quality of their performances: how well do they play the game?" Gergen says. "Did they give a good speech? Or did they do something interesting today? It's all the same. The horse-race nature of the campaign, which gets covered ad nauseam, now also dominates the Presidency. And I think in some ways that the people who are in the business of government and the people in the punditry business are almost co-conspirators. They are feeding off each other. The people in the press are judging you on that basis and the people inside are responding to that. Instead of saying, 'How do we change things in people's lives?' it has become: 'How do we put the packaging together? How do we put the bright ribbons on it that will make people think it is important, or interesting or different? How do we make the pundits say, "Gee, that was impressive"?' And this has no bearing on what happens underneath, and it creates a deepening cynicism."
 What he's criticizing, it is suggested:
 "Is stuff I've done. I admit that. I've done a lot of it. But you realize. . . . " Here he pauses for a long moment. "Look, I plead guilty to having played the game and inventing some forms of the game that I thought eventually went beyond what was intended. . . . It gave way over time to -- and this is what I regret -- a selling for the sake of selling. It had nothing to do with ideas. It had nothing to do with anything that was real. Eventually, it became selling the sizzle without the steak. There was nothing connected to it. It was all cellophane. It was all packaging. And I feel I contributed to that. There's no question about that. I'd been aggressive in my early years trying to get some of that set up. I did that in part because I thought that was the only way you could govern. I think now, as I get older, that the steak is very important, too. Yes, the selling has to continue, but it's not sufficient in and of itself. That becomes, over time, just an empty exercise."
 What happened to the Presidency and to Washington was, Gergen argues, inevitable. "We have an inherently weak institution in the Presidency," he says. "It was intentionally set up that way by the founders. There is a reason why the Presidency is Article II of the Constitution, not Article I. The Congress was always intended to be the leading body, with the Presidency set up as a somewhat weaker body. And it was the weaker body for most of our history."
 But modern Presidents and the news media both tend to exaggerate the powers of the office, says Gergen, voicing a theory most prominently advanced by the historian Richard Neustadt. This exaggeration, the theory goes, has magnified the gulf between what the President can accomplish and what the public expects of him.
 "Given this, and given the increasing power of the press, and the inability of contemporary Presidents to master the press enough to master the message, there has been a lot more effort on the part of the White Houses to manage the message, to orchestrate," Gergen says. "And that, in turn, increases the cynicism on the other side."
 There is obvious truth in this vicious-circle theory, but the cloak of inevitability obscures the more complicated, larger story -- and the role of David Gergen in it. The empty exercise Gergen now deplores is not simply the product of historical forces nor merely the result of the irresistible rise of news-media power. It is also the conscious design of a small group of smart, purposeful men -- advertising executives and scriptwriters and pollsters and strategists -- who worked over a period of two decades to invent a new type of Presidency, one that would be primarily defined by the television screen. Gergen occupies a curious position in the group. He invented none of the big ideas or foundation techniques of the image-age Presidency. But he had the good fortune to find himself on the inside more or less at the beginning of the change (he has a great knack for being in the right place at the right time), and he had the skills to prosper.
 He was intelligent and hard-working and he had a complex charm. A big man who underplayed his presence, he was solicitous of the opinions of others and expressed his own unthreatening thoughts in a soft, friendly voice that gave way easily to laughter. He was not a brilliant student of history or politics, but he was a dedicated one. He tended naturally to the accepted view and to the middle ground. And he had one more important talent. He was gifted at manipulating the appearances of all sorts of realities, including the reality of David Gergen.
 From Nixon to Ford to Reagan to Clinton, Gergen carried the faith of image and the image of himself, polishing and adapting and expanding both. As the years passed, his predecessors and peers fell by the wayside, the victims of changing tastes and times. But Gergen changed apace, and quietly, almost inconspicuously grew toward the great role to which he now aspires -- wise man of the age of image.
 On the day Pat Nixon told off the reporters on her doorstep, the age and Gergen were both bright and young. Kennedy's 1960 campaign had redefined politics. While other politicians had dipped into the waters of the new age -- Eisenhower had starred in both the first televised Presidential news conference and the first prime-time visit to the White House -- Kennedy was of the age. He had a generational grasp of what screen presence was about, and he ran for President essentially on qualifications of image: beauty, grace, youth, courage, wit, charm. The public J.F.K., shaped with a lapidary precision by the patriarch Joseph P. Kennedy, was a World War II hero, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, the pride of an ideal family and a devoted husband to a loving wife. That these achievements were in considerable part the creation of professional myth-makers was overlooked by a press corps that was (as Mrs. Nixon pointed out) largely pro-Kennedy and also ignorant of the extent to which it was being conned. In office, Kennedy was similarly attentive to image, and similarly successful. His Administration shone with a gloss that maximized such minor accomplishments as inviting Pablo Casals to dinner and minimized such major disasters as the invasion of Cuba.
 Kennedy's achievement made a powerful impression on Nixon and his advisers, who had to overcome one of the worst images in political history. On Nov. 28, 1967, the speech writer Ray Price, who would later become Gergen's boss and mentor in the Nixon White House, wrote a memorandum to his campaign colleagues explaining how the lessons of Kennedy could be applied to the problems of Nixon, who was planning a second campaign for President the following year.
 Nixon's woes, Price wrote, stemmed from "the fact that for years Nixon was one of those men it was fashionable to hate," a reaction to Nixon's style -- what Price called his "cutting edge." To change this political reality, Price said, it was not necessary to change the objective reality of Nixon. Voter approval for a Presidential candidate, Price argued, is not about reality but is "a product of the particular chemistry between the voter and the image of the candidate." He continued: "We have to be very clear on this point: that the response is to the image, not to the man, since 99 percent of the voters have no contact with the man. It's not what's there that counts, it's what's projected -- and . . . it's not what he projects but rather what the voter receives. It's not the man we have to change, but rather the received impression." 
 Price's insight, translated into a campaign plan of action by the advertising executive Frank Shakespeare and the television producer Roger Ailes, was revolutionary. The Democrats had never really advanced past the press-agentry techniques of inflating accomplishments and hiding flaws -- maintaining a tenuous connection to reality. Price postulated that a new political reality need not correspond at all to objective reality, that a new image could override both the known facts and the previous image of a candidate to become the only reality that mattered.
 By Election Day 1968, Nixon had been so thoroughly repackaged that he became, in a sense, the first President to win the office by suicide. The man sworn in on Jan. 20, 1969, was someone the press called the New Nixon.
 There was, of course, nothing really new at all. "You see in history a number of references to 'the New Nixon,' " recalls Herb Klein, Nixon's director of communications. "What that really meant was that he came on with a slightly different television technique. But he was the same man, had the same hostility to the press, the same values."
 In 1971, two years after the New Nixon took office, the 29-year-old Dave Gergen -- a Navy veteran, a graduate of Yale and Harvard Law School -- went to work for the President. The Nixon White House was Gergen's true university, and it was an extraordinary school. Here, a public-relations-obsessed President and his staff would create the prototype of the image-age Presidency. This model, which remains in use today, assumes that the powerful, chronically hostile news media work steadfastly against a President's interests, and that this must be countered by a systematic program of propaganda. What a President (or Presidential candidate) says or does must always be calculated for its effect on his image, plotted as points along the arc of his ideal persona, a construct largely determined by what the pollsters say the people regard as ideal at the moment. Since the news media will trumpet the slightest deviation from the ideal as evidence of a flawed Presidency, the marketing of the President and his policies must be the primary concern of a White House, and campaigning must be a permanent feature of governance.
 Gergen remembers the selling of the Nixon image as a central fact of life in his first White House. "The great cynicism had already begun when Nixon took office," he says. "It came with Vietnam when a generation of reporters concluded that their Government was lying to them. Nixon arrived on the back end of that, and he came carrying this great personal animosity, a lack of trust in the press.
 "And Nixon understood that unless you mastered television, your Presidency would be ripped apart. And so he developed, the Nixon White House developed, a whole series of ideas about how one talks to the press and communicates through the press. A sort of rules for the road for how a White House acts."
 The Nixonian rules, Gergen says, "have been handed down from one Presidency to the next and have had enormous influence. "In many ways," he says, "I think almost everything we do now has come from those years."
 Gergen's contention is borne out by the archival records of the Nixon White House. In their first several years in office, the new President's men, guided by an unending flow of orders from Nixon and supervised by a former advertising executive, the chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, invented virtually all the practices of public relations and press handling that would become standard in later White Houses.
 Among the innovations were the coordination of an Administration-wide "line of the day" that was in turn part of an overall thematic "message"; the orchestrated use of surrogates and White House-connected "grass roots" organizations to build support, plant stories and attack enemies; a continuing effort to nullify the Washington press corps through an ongoing "outreach" program to the generally more friendly and malleable regional press; the carrot-and-stick technique of rewarding reporters and news organizations whose coverage is positive and attacking those who are critical.
 The ideas behind these techniques were not new. What Nixon's men did was to systematize the tricks of puffery and calumny that had long been used in campaigns and incorporate them into the routine operation of the White House. A critical advancement in the corruption of the Washington culture, this not only created new and expanded forms of such tactics, but also legitimized them. Future White Houses would embrace them as essential elements of "how the game is played," as Gergen puts it.
 "It was much more than just 'line of the day,' " Gergen remembers. "This was total orchestration. It was much more sophisticated than anything that had come before. There was a desire to control the entire environment, and a feeling that if you didn't control it, they would control it -- they, the great outside they."
 In their everlasting search for control, Nixon and Haldeman set up four separate press and propaganda operations. The traditional office of the press secretary remained, but with its power diminished by the exclusion of the person who held that position, Ron Ziegler, from a great deal of information, thus increasing White House control and providing the Administration with a mechanism for denying statements that later proved inconvenient. In addition to the press office, there were two inventions that would also shape the way future White Houses worked: the Office of Communications, directed by Herb Klein, and the Office of Public Liaison, directed by Charles W. Colson.
 Klein created two devices of lasting import, the pan-Governmental coordination of the White House line and the establishment of a press operation to feed local, regional and specialty news organizations outside the Washington press corps.
 "My concept was that the problem with Government was that everybody went off on their own way and there was no coordination," Klein recalls. "We set up weekly meetings with the people assigned to public affairs in each department of the Government, so the same song was singing through each department. At the same time, we built up coverage from the regional press -- a Cabinet officer speaking in Los Angeles or Minneapolis is going to make a lot more news than that same person speaking in Washington."
 The fourth division of the Nixon operation was Dave Gergen's home, the speech-writing office headed by Ray Price. Charged with producing not only Presidential speeches and talking points but also most of the endless stream of speeches needed for Klein and Colson's surrogate operations, the shop employed as many as 50 people during the peak period of the 1972 campaign. Price hired Gergen in 1971 as a staff assistant, and in 1972 made him his deputy, which entailed keeping track of writers' assignments and helping Price edit copy. By the beginning of Nixon's second term in 1973, the continuing crisis of Watergate had forced some officials senior to Gergen out of the White House and left those who remained exhausted and distracted. Price quit the speech-writing department to deal with Watergate full time, and Gergen took over the shop until Nixon's resignation on Aug. 9, 1974.
 Until Watergate, the overarching task of the entire press and public relations operation was the perpetuation of the New Nixon image. The obsession with this is illuminated in an unsigned "background memorandum" of December 1970. Kennedy, the memo noted caustically but accurately, had compiled a record in foreign policy of "utter disaster," but "his 'charm' saved the day for him." Eisenhower had been "distant and all business" with his staff, but had succeeded in projecting a "mythology" that he was really a "warm, kindly, fair man."
 The memo prescribed a series of steps to "build" a public President Nixon who would embody "those fundamental decencies and virtues which the great majority of Americans like -- hard work, warmth, kindness, consideration for others, willingness to take the heat and not pass the buck."
 By the time Gergen came to work in 1971, the make over effort had been organized into something that vaguely resembled a giant earth-moving job. Convinced that, in the awesome task of rebuilding Nixon, God lay somewhere in the details, White House "anecdotalists" dug and dug for "warm items" and "human-type incidents" about the President. The effort reached its sublimely silly peak in the RN Human Interest Story Program, ordered up in a 1971 memo from Haldeman to Price.
 A speech-department staff member culled dozens of anecdotes about Nixon from intimates and aides in a lengthy report, with each anecdote indexed according to the character trait it was meant to advertise: Repartee, Courage, Kindness, Strength in Adversity. What is most painfully obvious about these undertakings is how little the anecdotalists had to work with. Exemplifying the President's talent for Repartee was an account of Nixon silencing a New York businessman who had upbraided him over the Vietnam War by telling the man not to "give me any crap." Illustrating the President's Strength in Adversity was a bald little story of how the young Congressman Nixon, falling on an icy sidewalk, still managed to keep his 2-year-old daughter, Tricia, safe in his arms.
 In this perfectionist and paranoid atmosphere, Gergen learned the bones of his craft.
 He learned the importance of saying the same thing, over and over and over: "Nixon taught us about the art of repetition. He used to tell me, 'About the time you are writing a line that you have written it so often that you want to throw up, that is the first time the American people will hear it.' "
 He learned about the gimmicks of phrasing calculated to catch the public ear: "Haldeman used to say that the vast majority of words that issue under a President's name are just eminently forgettable. What you need to focus on is what's the line that is going to have a little grab to it." 
 He learned the theory of controlled access. If you gave the press only a smidgen of Presidential sight and sound on a given day, reporters would be forced to make their stories out of that smidgen: "Nixon used to go into the press room with a statement that was only 100 words long because he did not want them editing him. He knew if he gave them more than 100 words, they'd pick and choose what to use."
 He learned the endless discipline required to protect the image, which was as evanescent as morning mist: "It went into everything -- the speeches, the talking points, the appearances. Haldeman had a rule on appearances: if you wanted to put in a scheduling request for anything the President was going to do in public, your request had to fulfill what we called H.P.L. -- Headline, Picture, Lede. You had to say, in writing, what the headline out of the event was going to be, what the lede was going to be and what the picture was going to be."
 The young Gergen also learned lessons he does not volunteer to talk about. These came under the tutelage of Chuck Colson, who managed the effort to shape perception of the President through a variety of hidden-hand means.
 "In 1969, Colson was brought in, and his big job was to rally national organizations of various stripes to support the President, and to set up new organizations to do this," recalls Lyn Nofziger, a longtime political operative who joined the White House staff that year. "Colson was tougher than hell, smarter than hell, meaner than hell. He built himself an empire there, 25 people working for him, and their whole job was to build up Dick Nixon and tear down his enemies."
 Colson adapted to governance the campaign strategy of using carefully controlled surrogates and grass-roots groups, using them not only to generate statements of ostensibly spontaneous support for the President and his policies, but also to attack political enemies from behind cover. In White House parlance, such surrogates were said to be "programmed" for attack, and were regarded as something akin to useful idiots. "Let's let columnists and Congressmen do that kind of work for us," sniffed a Haldeman aide, Jeb Stuart Magruder, in a 1970 memorandum urging a White House-staged offensive against the recently retired Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren.
 The speech-writing department was charged with scripting such attacks, and Gergen, in his administrative role, became increasingly responsible for assuring that Colson's orders were carried out. The critical period of Gergen's involvement -- and education -- came in the 1972 Presidential race between Nixon and the liberal Democratic candidate, George McGovern. In this campaign, Colson established a new standard in negative campaigning, using surrogates and the "line of the day" to put together one of the most effective, sustained and brutal political assaults in American history. Today's campaigns, dominated by systematic, tightly planned, character-based attacks, are the direct descendants of the 1972 Colson operation.
 The operation was directed through a daily 9:15 A.M. "attack meeting," led by Colson and famous still among old Nixon hands. Gergen attended the meetings as a representative of the speech-writing department.
 "These were real hardball meetings where we used to figure out, day by day, how we were going to tear McGovern's hide off, and it was Gergen's job to see to it that the necessary speeches were written to carry out each day's attack," recalls David Keene, a political consultant who attended the meetings in his role as an aide to Vice President Agnew. "The group charted, about a week in advance, what the attack message was going to be every day, what we were going to hit McGovern with that day and how to mobilize the entire resources of the campaign and even the Administration to focus on that single message and dominate the news."
 Some of Gergen's neat, handwritten notes of these meetings can be found in the White House records from that time. Each entry describes a specific attack to be carried out against McGovern. On Sept. 26, for example, Gergen wrote: "What do we have on Hill to embarrass McG for voting absences? Try to have Dole hit." And on that same day Gergen noted Colson's order that the campaign find "an incensed P.O.W. wife to strike out at the former Attorney General, McGovern supporter and antiwar activist Ramsey Clark. Get Sybil from Conn. Also get labor leader -- building trades."
 In typed memoranda, Gergen gave status reports on the actions ordered at the 9:15 meetings. "Nixon supporter and future pundit John McLaughlin on Today show," he wrote in one typical memo. "I spoke with him yesterday and fed him Ray Price's line asking how well George would sleep the night our boys came home and the N. Viets were slaughtering the S. Viets."
 Gergen's last lesson at the Nixon White House was the most important -- how to survive in Washington.
 By mid-1973, Watergate had reduced relations with the press to a state of war. "I have never seen anything like it since," Gergen says. "Every question was seen as a dagger pointed at the President."
 It was during this time that Gergen began to win an enduring reputation, both inside the White House and among reporters, as (depending on your point of view) a major leak or an excellent source. Toward the end, while most Nixon officials were refusing to deal with the press, Gergen was talking to investigative reporters who would write the history of Watergate. In one scene from "The Final Days," Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's sensational account of the last months of the Nixon White House, Gergen admits to an angry chief of staff, Alexander Haig Jr. that he was one of the ones leaking to the press. Pointing to a Washington Post article that had particularly incensed Haig with its portrait of a White House in wild disarray, Gergen confessed that he was the source of two damaging paragraphs quoting "one Presidential aide." (Today Gergen acknowledges that he did leak to Woodward, a fellow Yale graduate he had known for years, but only as "a designated leaker," acting "with Nixon's blessing.")
 Two points about this scene illustrate the basic relationship between Gergen and the press. One, it shows Gergen in a flattering light. (He may have leaked, but he did it for good reason, and he manfully admitted it.) Two, this flattering light was provided by David Gergen. Unless the authors resorted to fiction, Gergen had to have been at least one of the sources for the scene because his private (blameless) thoughts are described in detail. This is not an isolated happenstance. Gergen appears throughout "The Final Days" -- and always sympathetically. In scene after scene, he comes across as a moral, sometimes anguished man, who insists on doing the right thing while being lied to repeatedly by his President.
 This characterization is probably true. Gergen's recollection today of himself as "tortured" by Watergate is confirmed by several associates. But it also seems likely that Gergen has always known how the history he helped make in "The Final Days" made him look. Recalling Watergate 20 years later, Gergen volunteers that he has always "tried to maintain a standard of honesty," and twice suggests a rereading of "The Final Days" as proof. "You go back and read that, and you'll find I was trying to present a Government that was legitimate," he says.
 Having learned that history belongs to those who create it, Gergen developed a talent in the post-Watergate years for reshaping the historical perception of himself, exaggerating his role in some instances and minimizing it in others. In "The Power Game," Hedrick Smith's best-selling 1988 account of how Washington works, Gergen is cited as the person "put in charge of scripting the '72 Republican convention." In political circles, this is an important credit, because that convention was the first to be fully stage-directed for television, now a standard procedure. The account Gergen gives in "The Power Game" of how the operation worked is fascinating and wonderfully candid -- except that Gergen was not at all in charge of scripting that convention.
 Ron Walker, who was chief of advance for the White House in 1972, says that he and a number of Nixon aides, including Dwight Chapin and Bill Timmons, were the chief scriptwriters of the Republican convention that year. "Gergen wasn't involved much," Walker says. "I can remember him sitting in meetings with us, and as a speech writer. I'm sure he participated in some of those meetings, but that's all I remember of him there."
 But Gergen has quietly played down other activities of his early career. "He tried to forget he was ever part of the 9:15 meeting," David Keene recalls. "I remember Colson gave all of us who had been in it these cuff links that were engraved with 9:15. Years later, I ran into Gergen at a dinner, and he saw I was wearing those cuff links, and he was horrified. He said: 'You actually wear those? Are you crazy? Someone might see them.' "
 After Nixon flew away in the summer of 1974, Gergen went to work writing speeches for William E. Simon, then Secretary of the Treasury. Simon, a Wall Street financier whose investing acumen made him one of the world's richest men after he returned to private life in 1977, was at the time considered Presidential material. He was also a deeply committed conservative, to the right of Nixon and well to the right of Gergen.
 Gergen made the ideological adjustment with seeming effortlessness. "I had a point of view and he understood it," Simon recalls. "He caught on real quick."
 Bill Schulz, a Washington editor who later worked with Simon on two books, remembers Simon's marveling at Gergen's adaptability. "Bill told me that Gergen was the hardest hard-line speech writer that he ever had," Schulz says. "He knew Gergen didn't believe in any of it. But when he wrote for Bill Simon, he wrote what Bill Simon wanted."
 In 1975, Gergen went to work for President Ford, in his first big-title White House job, director of communications. After Jimmy Carter took the White House in 1977, Gergen made his first forays into political journalism, writing freelance articles and, in March 1978, becoming the first managing editor of Public Opinion, a new magazine published by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.
 On the side, Gergen the journalist remained Gergen the political operator, writing speeches in 1977 and 1978 for Ronald Reagan and Simon, as they explored their Presidential chances. But it was clear that Simon's appeal to nonplutocratic voters was limited, and Gergen began looking for a candidate in the 1980 race. He settled, very lightly, on George Bush, the slim reed upon whom Republican moderates rested their hopes of stopping Reagan from taking over the party.
 "He became Bush's unofficial issues guy," recalls David Keene, who was then Bush's national political director, "putting together gatherings of economists in Kennebunkport and writing speeches." But at the time Bush attracted so little support in the polls that news accounts called him the "asterisk" candidate. Gergen kept a low profile, citing a busy schedule as the reason for turning down an offer by Bush and his campaign manager, James Baker, who had also worked with Ford, to join the campaign formally as issues director.
 Then, on Jan. 21, 1980, Bush unexpectedly won the Iowa Republican caucus and became the instant front-runner. "The very next day, Gergen called up Baker and said, miracle of miracles, he had managed to clear his schedule and would be able to take the job after all," Keene says. "When Baker said the job was filled, Gergen came in as a volunteer speech writer." In the month between the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary, when Bush was the leading Republican candidate, Gergen, according to Keene, "was very visible."
 But on Feb. 26, Bush lost the New Hampshire primary to a resurgent Ronald Reagan. "And Gergen just disappeared completely, I mean right away," recalls Peter Teeley, Bush's press secretary at the time. "We never heard from him again until he turned up with Reagan at the Republican convention."
 Even the Reaganites, who benefited from Gergen's leap, were appalled by the speed of it. "He came to us as soon as it began to seem Bush was going to lose, definitely before Bush pulled out, and quite frankly this made us very suspicious of him," recalls a former Reagan campaign official. "I mean, there's jumping ship and there's jumping ship. This guy was elbowing the women and children aside to get overboard."
 Gergen strongly denies that he showed any undue haste in switching allegiances. "It is not true that I disappeared in the campaign," he says. "I continued to advise Bush much in the same way I had up to the point he was nominated Vice President."
 After the Republican convention, the Reagan campaign hired Baker as an adviser, and Gergen was assigned, along with fellow Bush alumnus Frank Hodsoll, to the task of preparing the candidate's briefing books for the Presidential debates. He thus became party to the most infamous episode of the 1980 campaign -- the appropriation by members of the Reagan camp of the briefing papers prepared by President Jimmy Carter's staff for the campaign's first and only debate.
 Gergen says today that he has "a vague memory" of receiving the Carter material, which he remembers giving to Hodsoll. But he claims that the material consisted of "a summary of what Carter had said publicly and public documents." He says he "was not aware that the material was stolen; it could have been leaked by some disgruntled person in the Carter camp." And anyway, he says, "We didn't really use the stuff."
 But a 2,413-page report of the House Subcommittee on Human Resources, which investigated the "Debategate" affair in 1984, contradicts Gergen. The report concluded that the Reagan campaign had "obtained foreign policy and national defense briefing papers prepared to assist President Carter," that the papers were the "property of the Federal Government . . . likely taken from the offices of the National Security Council" and that the materials obtained "were not publicly available." It also found that the Carter papers "were used . . . to enhance Governor Reagan's performance in the debates. The persons using these papers were aware that they were using Carter debate briefing materials."
 Also a matter of sharply differing memories is Gergen's role in the 1980-81 Presidential transition. It was during this period that the Reagan team produced a document that would become famous in political circles as "the 100 days memo," a blueprint for the successful post-Inaugural program to sell the nation on Reaganomics. Gergen has routinely claimed authorship, or co-authorship, of the plan; as recently as June 7 of this year, he recalled it as something "I wrote." And this credit was one reason Clinton strategists sought out his advice during the 1992-93 transition.
 Richard Wirthlin, Reagan's chief pollster at the time and widely acknowledged to be the primary author of the memo, remembers Gergen's contributions in more modest terms -- a recollection corroborated by other former Reagan aides. "I brought together a small team -- myself, Roger Porter, who later came to the White House as a domestic policy adviser, and Richard Beal, who'd worked on issues in the campaign," Wirthlin says. "We were the unit that produced the paper. Gergen contributed in a minor way -- an 8-to-10-page historical overview of other Presidential beginnings -- and a suggested first-month schedule."
 Gergen joined the Reagan White House in January 1981, as a staff director, and became communications director toward the end of the first 100 days, following the shooting of James Brady, the press secretary. "Up to this point, our guys had never really understood how to work a story," recalls Ed Rollins, who was hired as deputy to Lyn Nofziger, the first director of the White House political affairs office. "But Gergen really understood sound bites. He understood how to pick a story, how to get a story that somebody was working on and change it, how to get the reporters to call the people you wanted them to call and make the story come out how you wanted. He understood that you had to be proactive about it, as opposed to just letting you guys do your job and us just reading about it in the paper the next day."
 The Reagan White House set up a structure closely modeled on the Nixon operation, with a coordinated program for disseminating the Administration line through Government and party surrogates and a sophisticated system of news-media manipulation. "It isn't hard to do," says Joe Canzeri, then a White House advance man. "You get all your team together ahead of time and you say 'Gentlemen, this week we will be selling tacos, not nachos.' Whether they really are tacos doesn't matter. If we tell you guys they are tacos enough times, you'll believe they're tacos."
 The news-media operation was principally directed by a group that included Michael Deaver (the deputy chief of staff and the President's chief imagist), Gergen, Richard Darman, Kenneth Duberstein and Canzeri. Deaver directed the meetings, which took place every Friday afternoon at Blair House, the White House's guest residence. 
 "We tried to plan and manage hour by hour what Reagan was going to do, to keep the focus on the theme," Deaver remembers. "We would go through the President's schedule day by day and hour by hour, and figure out what we wanted the story to be at the end of each day and at the end of the week. And that worked about 90 percent of the time."
 To Gergen fell the crucial task of spinning and leaking. "Baker decided early on that there were only two constituencies that mattered -- the national media and Congress -- and he devoted a great deal of time and energy to wooing the media," Rollins recalls. "Larry Speakes" -- the White House spokesman -- "wasn't allowed in the key decision-making meetings, so he really couldn't tell the press anything but the canned lines. Anybody who wanted to find out anything beyond that had to go somewhere else. And in that White House, pretty much the only place they could go was to Baker and Gergen.
 "Gergen was Baker's man, and reporters had to go to him to get to Baker," Rollins continues. "Every major news organization had an hour a week with Baker, every week. When he was chief of staff, Baker spent 35 hours a week talking to journalists. He gave an hour a day to the three networks, to The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal. Gergen had to fill in all the blanks. Baker would give the big overview to the press at the end of the week -- this is what we're going to do next week, etc. -- and then Gergen would, day by day, hour by hour, deal with things that came up."
 As the chief daily leaker, Gergen became an essential figure for reporters, someone with whom it paid to speak as often as possible. This gave him access to valuable information in return -- the daily knowledge of what the White House press corps was working on. Then, completing the circle, he was in a position to spin the reporters, so that the final stories would reflect, at least in part, the White House point of view.
 "Dave was compulsive in his leaks," recalls one former White House official. "When he would leave a meeting in a hurry, people would joke that he was rushing to meet his deadline. People called him the assistant to the President for The New York Times."
 Gergen's work in shaping the image of Ronald Reagan allowed him to shape another image -- that of David Gergen. "He was not discerning about how his leaks made the President appear," says the former Reagan official. "There was a very strong feeling that he was motivated more by a desire to ingratiate himself with reporters than by any desire to help the President."
 Eventually, according to several former Administration officials, including Vic Gold, a Bush biographer and speech writer, Baker called Gergen in for a discussion of the leaks. This led to Gergen's resignation in 1983.
 "There is no question Gergen's leaking had something to do with his departure," says another official. "He did not leave by his own choice. He was strongly encouraged to move on by Baker."
 Gergen recalls today that Baker did indeed call him in for a meeting and told him that there were "many daggers" aimed at him, including one wielded by the well-manicured hand of Nancy Reagan. And, according to Gergen, when he told Baker he had decided to leave the White House, Baker replied, "I think that's a wise decision." But Gergen maintains the decision was strictly his own: "I was not pushed."
 It is the autumn of 1993, and Bill Clinton, who is as surely of the apex of the image age as John F. Kennedy was of its dawn, looms over the video landscape, cordless microphone in hand, forever talking, listening, empathizing. At times, it seems his is the Presidency as public-access television; everyone gets on the air with him sooner or later. He talks with Larry King and Tabitha Soren and Katie Couric and Dan Rather and Arsenio Hall and Don Imus -- and with mall shoppers and redwood loggers and hardhats and soldiers and sailors and teachers and children and folks eating lunch.
 In the selling of the Administration's health plan, politics, policy, advertising and journalism have become, finally, a single organism. Speaking before Congress to introduce the health plan on Sept. 22, the President holds aloft a red, white and blue card of gleaming Visa-like plastic, on the back of which is printed, in the language of a late-night-television insurance pitch, a promise of such largesse as to give God pause: "This health security card guarantees you a comprehensive package of benefits that can never be taken away."
 In the surrounding hoopla: Hillary Rodham Clinton makes five televised Congressional appearances and sits for interviews with Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, Paula Zahn, Katie Couric and Joan Lunden. . . . The President answers questions from the citizenry for two and a half hours on "Nightline," is the host of a televised "town meeting" in California and conducts an Oprah Winfrey-style show at a Queens diner, where people chosen by the White House to illustrate inadequate health insurance tell of their suffering. . . . The Democratic National Committee kicks off a direct-mail-and-telephone drive featuring letters, which are Robo-signed by the President and resemble in tone Ed McMahon's missives on behalf of Publishers' Clearinghouse. ("The winner of this campaign would not be a politician, but every American family.") . . . The Clintons hold what Gergen calls "a very dignified lunch" for two dozen big-foot journalists, including R. W. Apple Jr. of The New York Times, David Broder of The Washington Post, Jack Germond of The Baltimore Sun, Michael Kinsley of The New Republic, Jack Nelson of The Los Angeles Times and Albert Hunt of The Wall Street Journal. . . . Meanwhile, 55 radio talk-show hosts broadcast live from tables set up on the front lawn of the White House, as Administration spinners shuttle and weave among them.
 By contrast, Franklin Delano Roosevelt introduced the Social Security Act in 1935 with a modest, brief message to Congress that was read by clerks; during the ensuing legislative process, he spoke publicly about it only twice: once in a short press conference and once in a radio address.
 But the President in 1993 seems to have lost the option of exercising dignity or restraint in support of his policies. The conversation of politics now is carried on in the vernacular of advertising now. The big sell, the television sell, appears to be the only way to sell. Increasingly, and especially in Washington, how well one does on television has come to determine how well one does in life.
 The Attorney General presides over a disastrous commando raid on a religious cult in Texas that leaves at least 80 people dead -- and is hailed as a new American hero for performing well on "Nightline." The Vice President appears on "Late Show with David Letterman," where guests are expected to mock themselves, and wins applause by doing so with gusto; he says his Secret Service code name is Buttafuoco and performs the Stupid Vice President Trick of breaking a glass ashtray with a hammer. Ross Perot, a rich man who made his fortune on Government contracts to computerize the welfare state, becomes a political force playing the made-for-television character of a feisty, folksy, six-gunning outsider. Washington writers work overtime crafting clever bits for turns on the talk shows; a Sunday on "Meet the Press" does more to reaffirm a print reporter's standing than all the work he might do in that week.
 Washington has become a strange and debased place, the true heart of a national culture in which the distinction between reality and fantasy has been lost, a culture that has produced Oliver Stone as a historian, Joe McGinniss as a biographer, Geraldo Rivera as a journalist, Leonard Jeffries as a geneticist and Barbra Streisand as an authority on national policy. The standards and boundaries that have been eroding for years have at last faded almost completely away. The rare Governmental privilege of speaking under the cloak of anonymity, traditionally granted only to Presidents, Secretaries of State and generals in time of war, has become an accepted practice for midlevel White House aides explaining routine policy matters to large roomfuls of reporters. Movie stars show up with their press agents and their bodyguards to "testify" before Congress. Politicians and reporters make cameo appearances as movie stars, playing themselves in fictional scenes about politics and reporting.
 Political operatives call themselves journalists and journalists behave like political operatives, giving private advice to their politician friends -- and this practice is so widely accepted as to be uncommented on. In early 1992, the advisers to the Presidential candidate Clinton included the journalist Gergen. In February, on the darkest day of the campaign, when the story broke of the candidate's famous 1969 letter on his Vietnam War draft status, Gergen says he "had a serious talk" with Clinton, "all about where he was going, what he was going through." "I walked through with him what the essence of the charge against him was," Gergen says, "and the essence of his response . . . and I told him what particular point in his response had made the best impression on me."
 Journalists have also joined politicians in the business of selling the pleasure of their company to special-interest groups. Not long ago, only someone in position actually to create objective reality -- a lawmaker, for instance -- could hope to receive an "honorarium" of thousands of dollars for spending an hour or so chatting up a roomful of lobbyists. Now the marketplace recognizes that those who create the perception of reality are equally worthy of honor in the form of cash. At a convention of the American Medical Association last year in Atlanta, according to an A.M.A. spokesman, the paid speakers included Tom Brokaw, Michael Kinsley, Jeff Levine (the CNN health issues reporter) and Marshall Loeb (the managing editor of Fortune magazine). In his last year and a half as a journalist, before joining the White House, Gergen earned almost $700,000 from speaking engagements.
 The press pack has become both obese and incestuous. There are 1,700 accredited White House reporters, and most of them keep in promiscuous electronic touch -- through Nexis and the Federal News Service and The Associated Press and Reuters and CNN and PBS and C-Span -- with each other's work and with the vast bloviation of words and pictures that Washington produces every day. Overwhelmed by size and undermined by excessive intimacy, the pack has lost its howling way. It has become as faddish as a teen-ager, vacillating in its attitudes toward the powers that be, going from bubbling enthusiasm to hysterical anger, from cheering all that the President says to denouncing all that the President does. It is so thoroughly conformist that it celebrates group-think as (conventional) wisdom.
 Obsessed with the appearances of things, the pack is perpetually susceptible to the machinations of the image-makers. It rewards, with glowing praise, triumphs of form over content: medium-well-turned phrases, smart photo ops, effective P.R. stunts. But it is also unhappily aware of its vulnerability, and exacts a perverse revenge by seizing on the slightest misstep, the smallest deviation from the perfect image, as an example of what Gergen calls "a naked moment in politics," a metaphoric event that presumes to cut through the theater to show the true man. A single such event -- Clinton and the haircut, Quayle and the potato(e), Carter and the killer rabbit, Bush at the checkout counter -- its significance heightened with every retelling, can permanently scar a public figure, and several in a row can be fatal. Every year, a new species of misdemeanor is defined as a high crime. This year, inattention to the tax laws regarding baby sitters and house cleaners became the hanging offense.
 Unhappily aware that much of what Government officials say and do in public is a charade, unknowing of much that occurs behind closed doors and unwilling to admit ignorance, reporters fashion reality out of perceptions. A New York Times article in February reports that the President's advisers are worried about "the perception thus wrought" by his rocky beginning, and says the Administration is working "to refocus its image as a Government of broad, middle-class interests." A Times report in May finds "a perception that the President," who won office as a political centrist, "has come to look very much like the same old -- liberal -- thing."
 These bits of fatuousness are unexceptional in contemporary Washington journalism; they stand out in my mind only because I wrote them myself.
 A lot of people, even in Washington, look upon all this with regret and even horror, but for David Gergen the reaction is more painfully personal. After 20 years of helping make the game of Washington what it is, he is now stirred, he says, by feelings of sadness and guilt.
 "This is a hard thing to discuss," he says. "It's very close to the bone. But in our public affairs, including the Presidency, there's a certain amount of propaganda that goes on, a certain amount of overselling, and I plead guilty to doing a lot of it in the past. . . . I feel a measure of guilt about accelerating the game, and making it bigger in years past. I felt at the time it was important . . . and I contributed to it, participated in it, I believed in it, I thought it was the right thing. And I think what I did helped lead to the changes in the way the game is played today, where it has been taken beyond where we were then. It had some consequences we didn't foresee. The game has become more and more the thing, there is an overselling in politics now that was not there to this degree 12 years ago, 14 years ago. . . . It has become structural.
 "But my larger sense of guilt, to the degree that I share in this responsibility, is not about the P.R. game that has developed, but about what's happening to the people of this country because of it. I don't think Government over the last 20 years had been anywhere near as responsive as it should have been with some very real problems. And I realize now that the measure of success ought not to be, you know, Presidential rhetoric -- although that's an important element of measured success -- but actions that really make a difference in terms of how we affect people's lives. And in this sense, I think Government and the people in Washington have been derelict over the last 20 years."
 He defends his return to the White House as an act not of opportunism but of expiation for the sins of his work in Administrations past. "I guess I feel I pay my debt back to society by seeing changes made that would affect our lives in a way that would match our public rhetoric," he says.
 In two long conversations, Gergen returns again and again to this theme. "What I've become cynical about is that a lot of what happens in Washington now is not about things that have connection to people's lives outside this city. It's all the ball game now. It's not about whether an idea makes sense in terms of changing the country. And through all these games over the years, the country has been going down the tubes."
 He says he would like to leave the game behind. "I know that some of it is necessary. I know that it is part of the way that the game is played, but I just don't find it personally as alluring as I once did. . . . I've evolved. I used to spend a lot of time worrying about how do we shape the next day's headline? How do we shape that nice picture? Maybe it's a question of age, or maybe just that I've been there, but I'm not the person who thinks about that sort of thing every day now."
 The Sieve leaks only on occasion now, and only at the highest levels. At 51, he says, he sees Washington -- and himself -- differently from the days when he was young and "very ambitious and very much going after the brass ring." When he speaks of the men he admires, he speaks of the legends of the city, the political players who became insiders' insiders and finally reached the apogee of success, the special status known as wise man. The names roll off his tongue -- Robert Strauss, the consummate deal maker; Bryce Harlow, the lawyer-lobbyist who worked for two Republican Administrations, and, of course, Clark Clifford, adviser to Democratic Presidents since Truman -- the city's eminence grise until, Gergen contends, "he was smeared" in the B.C.C.I. scandal.
 Gergen does not claim the wise man title for himself yet, but already he is talking like one. When he speaks of counseling the 47-year-old Clinton, he sounds a bit like a proud teacher noting the progress of a promising student.
 "He's evolving," Gergen says of the President. "I think he's got a much better grasp of the job." When Gergen first came to the White House in May, he says Clinton "had been buffeted so heavily in the early months that I felt he had lost his footing and wasn't as sure of what it is he wanted to be as I had seen in the past. And it seemed to me over the course of the summer, he was gaining it back."
 There are still problems, Gergen says: "He needs more time to think. We need to build more time into his schedule so he can think. . . . He's at his best when he's decided what he really thinks. He's not comfortable otherwise. I've seen this just again and again. On gays in the military -- he wasn't comfortable until he had a chance to really work his own way through it. He wasn't comfortable with Lani Guinier until he'd worked his way through it. He wasn't comfortable in Somalia until he had worked his way through it."
 In this ongoing process, Gergen sees his own role as "not to say, 'Here's what you must do in the next three days on this issue,' but to say: 'Here are your options. Let's talk about them and sort through what the consequences are. Let's think it through. Let's ask some hard questions. Let's look down around the corner. When the thing blows up in our faces, as it may, where do you want to be, and how are you going to feel about that?' "
 But even more important, Gergen says, the Bill Clinton of today, "has developed -- and I've talked about this with him a fair amount -- a different view of the Presidency and what leadership is about, and how to lead."
 Interestingly enough, this different view of leadership harks back to the Presidency of yesterday, the Presidency in a time before people like Gergen went to work on it. "There have been so many lies told in the past, so many things oversold in the past," Gergen says. The President, he argues, must abandon the role of "commentator in chief," appearing on television every night to pronounce on whatever needs to be sold that day or whatever the press wants reaction to. "People don't need to see him out there with a comment on whatever it is." Instead, Gergen says, the President must "set this larger vision and be working toward that, and set goals for the nation, and try to inspire people toward those goals. And I think he's gotten much better at that."
 The selling of the President, Gergen says, has got to calm down, to return to a closer connection with reality. "We have been subjected to so much hype and fluff, that a bit more modesty could pay dividends," he says. "The resources you have to deal with are so limited and the changes you can make are mostly so incremental, that it is important not to oversell. If you do, the b.s. factor is so high on both sides that people see it immediately as over the top."
 It would be nice to think that this modest proposal isn't merely Gergen's ultimate spin -- the spinner renouncing his past spinning, as he spins again. It would be nicer yet to think that Gergen's words might become reality, that the game might end or at least slow down, that the faith of image and insiderism that defines Washington might finally lose its appeal. But not even David Gergen, the budding wise man, really thinks that is going to happen any time soon.
 The other day, as I was leaving the White House," he says, "I counted the cameras on the lawn for the evening standups. There were 24 of them. Twenty-four! What do you do about that? What do you do about the line of interview requests as long as your arm. If the President says to hell with them, then he's inaccessible. If he does the interviews, he's overselling again.
 "So much of what we do has become a necessary part of the game. It's almost impossible to change the rules in the middle."
 He sounds almost wistful. "To think that you can turn off the Government's information machine and still run the Government is -- why, it's hard to imagine it. It requires an enormous leap into a wholly different approach, and one that would probably bring about some unforeseen consequences to the whole system. You know, the Presidency probably would just become dysfunctional."

 BODY:

THE DIVINERS
By Margaret Laurence. University of Chicago, $12.95.
This Canadian author's fifth novel, originally published in 1974, is the story of a middle-aged writer who sees her young daughter, whom she's raised alone, preparing to separate from her. Our reviewer, Marge Piercy, called the book "ambitious and compelling." 

MAHATMA GANDHI AND HIS APOSTLES
By Ved Mehta. Yale University, $15.
This biography, drawing on interviews with Gandhi's disciples, examines his personality as much as his beliefs. The result is "a very readable account, dotted with sharply etched portraits," Paul Johnson said here in 1977. In addition, Yale has restored to print Mr. Mehta's PORTRAIT OF INDIA ($18.50), with a new preface by the author. It explores the national character through anecdotes and vignettes that illuminate divergent religions, castes and locales. In 1970 our reviewer, Stephen Spender, said, "The reader not only has the sense of immersion in the sights, scents and sounds of India, he also meets representative people." Also back in print is GODS, DEMONS, AND OTHERS, by R. K. Narayan (University of Chicago, $12.95), a retelling by a modern Indian novelist of tales from Tamil and Sanskrit epics like "The Maha bharata" and "The Ramayana." "Mr. Narayan gives vitality and an original viewpoint to the most ancient of legends," Santha Rama Rau said here in 1964.
GERMAN HISTORY: 1770-1866
By James J. Sheehan. Oxford University, $24.95.
The author investigates the circumstances leading to the first German unification, brought about through Prussian military might in 1871. In 1990 our reviewer, Thomas Childers, said that Mr. Sheehan's rebuttal of Prussian-centered doctrine regarding these developments is of interest not only to historians, but also to observers of reunification, who "will find no better guide than James Sheehan's wise and masterly book."
THE KINSHIP. Two Novels From the Darby Series:
A Little More Than Kin. The Passion of Estelle Jordan
By Ernest Hebert. University Press of New England, $16.95.
Featuring a new essay by the author, this volume includes two novels about the imaginary town of Darby, an impoverished place in rural New Hampshire where he has set five works of fiction. In "A Little More Than Kin," Ollie Jordan, one of "the shack people," attempts to resolve the fate of his retarded son, Willow. "We are given a shifting narrative perspective, a story told, as in Faulkner, by different characters in fits and fragments in a wonderfully comic mode," Nicholas Delbanco said here in 1982. "The Passion of Estelle Jordan" continues the tale of the clan, told by Estelle, Ollie's mother, now a prostitute. In 1987 our reviewer, Dave Smith, called it "a novel mating social realism with fable."
THE CONGRESSMAN WHO GOT AWAY WITH MURDER
By Nat Brandt. Syracuse University, $14.95.
Yes, it is true. In 1859 Dan Sickles, a Democrat from Manhattan, shot Washington's District Attorney, Philip Barton Key (son of Francis Scott Key), who had been having an affair with his wife. The trial established a legal precedent: the plea of temporary insanity. "By artfully reviving the Sickles case, Mr. Brandt has transformed what might have been just a trivial pursuit into an object lesson," Sam Roberts said here last year.
ROUGH TRANSLATIONS: Stories
By Molly Giles. University of Georgia, $9.95.
Winner of the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction, this collection depicts characters who are often unable to connect, either with their pasts or one another. In 1985 our reviewer, Roberta Grant, said, "We are privy to interplays of time and desire that leave the characters stymied but the reader highly gratified."
PHOTOGRAPHS
By Eudora Welty. University Press of Mississippi, $27.50.
The author mastered photography even before fiction, beginning in the 1930's when she was a junior publicity agent for the Federal Works Progress Administration. These pictures of the Deep South show its "unposed, un-self-conscious, playing, working, struggling denizens," Suzanne MacNeille said here in 1990.
THE JULES VERNE STEAM BALLOON: Nine Stories
By Guy Davenport. Johns Hopkins University, $12.95.
The characters in this short-story collection range from historical figures to a class of young students and their teacher. In 1987 our reviewer, Howard Coale, said the author's "poetic, incisive sentences flicker like pieces of a stained-glass window." Johns Hopkins has also reissued Mr. Davenport's earlier collection, ECLOGUES: Eight Stories ($12.95), in which the author uses a kind of collage technique to illuminate archaic texts and characters. His "stories will prove to be a boon to literary academics," Hilton Kramer said here in 1981.
LETTERS FROM THE LOST GENERATION: Gerald and Sara Murphy and Friends
Edited by Linda Patterson Miller. Rutgers University, $15.95.
Gerald and Sara Murphy were the enthusiastic hosts, patrons and friends of Zelda and Scott, Ernest and Hadley and numerous other American literary couples who visited their villa on the French Riviera. In 1991 our reviewer, William H. Pritchard, found in this collection of correspondence "fine comic moments of truth."
WHIRLPOOL: U.S. Foreign Policy Toward Latin America and the Caribbean
By Robert A. Pastor. Princeton University, $14.95.
The author recommends that our nation use the demise of Communist threats as an opportunity to forge a relationship with Latin American and Caribbean countries that is based on free trade and the fostering of democracy. "Mr. Pastor is most persuasive in his writing on economic policy, especially as it relates to Mexico," Clifford Krauss said here earlier this year.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Wanted: Actress to Play Pakistani, Chilean or Indian

BYLINE: By LAUREN DAVID PEDENR

 BODY:
Sarita Choudhury is decked out in navy warm-up pants, a tatty blue T-shirt and worn Army boots -- all topped by a leonine mane of unbrushed hair. She appears worlds away from the traditional, sari-wearing Mina, the character she played in her first film, "Mississippi Masala." But after ordering a cappuccino at a restaurant in Greenwich Village and lighting up the first of several Marlboros, it becomes apparent that Ms. Choudhury has at least one thing in common with her fictional counterpart.
"Don't write how much I smoke," she says in a throaty baritone. "My parents will kill me!" 
 Despite the success of the 1992 film "Mississippi Masala," the interracial love story between a rural black man and an Indian woman that became an unexpected art-house hit, Ms. Choudhury has started her acting career over again, at the bottom. Although she has parts in three forthcoming films, either the movies are small and idiosyncratic or her part is minor.
In "Wild West," which opens on Friday, she appears as a Pakistani woman fleeing her abusive husband. The woman becomes a singer for three Pakistani brothers who seek success as country-and-western stars in London. In a forthcoming screen adaptation of "House of the Spirits," Isabel Allende's 1985 novel about a Chilean family, Ms. Choudhury has a small part as a working-class woman who is raped by an aristocratic landowner (Jeremy Irons); the film, directed by Bille August, opens early next year. In "Fresh Kill," a low-budget apocalyptic fable awaiting a distributor, she plays an Indian lesbian raising a black child with her white partner.
The 27-year-old actress, who is single and lives in the SoHo section of Manhattan, has hardly faced typecasting, nor has she gone Hollywood. She does not have a publicist. Next year, she says, she may break down and visit the West Coast.
The daughter of an Indian father and an English mother, Ms. Choudhury (pronounced CHOW-dur-y) was raised in Jamaica, Mexico and Italy. She studied economics at Queens University in Ontario, then, after some resistance on the part of her father, a biologist with the United Nations ("He thought I was having a breakdown"), she switched to movie making. Armed with a degree in film studies, she went to Italy to look for work, then headed for London, where she got a job editing a travel guide to Italy.
She began modeling part time, and as a lark, she auditioned for "Mississippi Masala." Mira Nair, the director, had been searching for someone who could evoke Mina's demure yet wild spirit (and hold her own with the co-star Denzel Washington).
"I had asked a casting director to scour England for me," Ms. Nair recalls, "and among the photographs was one bent-out-of-shape, torn, out-of-focus picture of this woman who did not want to be photographed. She scowled into the camera, and she had these luscious lips and this massive hair. I was riveted."
When Ms. Choudhury arrived to audition, Ms. Nair says, "I immediately saw in her a combination of intelligence, fearlessness and this sexuality she just couldn't help exuding."
The fearlessness evaporated when Ms. Choudhury met Mr. Washington, who had just won an Oscar for best supporting actor for his role in "Glory." "The first time we met, I was so shy," she says. "I just sat there while he and Mira talked. I was so worried about him thinking, 'Who is this girl?' " At the beginning, she says, "I was nervous, and he let me play with that. He never made me feel like, "I'm not working with this.' "
Although her performance was widely praised by critics, the actress felt she needed to begin again. "It was hard for me," she says, "because even though I'd done a film, I was just learning how to audition. And people didn't know what I'd be right for." Her three new roles followed months of reading, she says, "for anything."
After "Masala," Ms. Choudhury was eager to work with people like herself, or, as she puts it, "people my age and not famous." She read the script for "Wild West" and lied about her singing ability to get the part.
"Who knew she could sing?" asked Ms. Nair, who has seen a trailer for the film. The fact is she can't, at least not well enough to be heard in the movie. The director, David Attwood, had the songs dubbed using the voice of the singer Rebecca Price.
In "House of the Spirits," she will again appear with someone who is distinctly not her age and is indeed famous, Mr. Irons. The larger challenge, though, has been to understand the mind-set of Chileans in the 1920's. "In that era, the working class was raped by the upper class, and your mother would tell you, 'Shut up, have the baby, and don't cause trouble, because I'll lose my job,' " she says in disbelief. She was also eager that the rape scene be shot so as "to show the violence, because it's not supposed to be erotic."
"It was really hard to play a woman who is not resisting that much," she added. "I mean, I'm from the 90's, and I just wanted to kick him!"

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Spreading the Gospel of Improvement Districts

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
AN astute director of a business improvement district usually has some telling statistics at the ready. Gretchen Dykstra has more than a few.
Ms. Dykstra, the president of the 18-month-old Times Square Business Improvement District, had it at the tip of her tongue last week that purse snatching and pickpocketing in the district were down 43 percent in the three months from April through June this year. In that period last year the district's uniformed but unarmed security officers were just getting started. 
 "Now we know who the pickpockets are, to say nothing of the scalpers," Ms. Dykstra said. "And there's been a 70 percent decrease in three-card monte players from June to August."
The Times Square district covers 404 properties with 30 million square feet of space in the area from 40th to 53d Street, basically from Sixth Avenue to just west of Eighth Avenue. With an annual budget of $4.6 million, it is the latest in a series of improvement districts in Manhattan business centers. The districts are bringing improvements in security, sanitation, signage, lighting and assorted public services beyond the duty or capacity of the city Government to provide.
The insights of the district administrators are getting an attentive hearing in areas outside their boundaries. Daniel A. Biederman, president of the Grand Central Partnership and the 34th Street Partnership, the operators of the improvement districts in those areas, got such a hearing a few days ago when he carried the gospel downtown.
He was a speaker at a half-day seminar on the future of the financial district co-sponsored by Lehrer McGovern Bovis, the construction management company; Rose Associates Inc., the building and management concern, and BOMA/New York, the Building Owners' and Managers' Association of Greater New York.
Against the background of the 20 percent vacancy rate downtown, the obsolescence of many of its structures for office use and the decline in employment, panelists emphasized the area's fundamental long-term planning needs. Transportation improvements, across-the-board tax relief and less oppressive building and zoning regulations were high on many lists.
Quality of life issues are considered less pressing than they are in other parts of Manhattan. But the downtown area is nevertheless forming an improvement district. The Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association has received a designation from the city Government to take on the task. Robert R. Douglass , the chairman of the association and vice chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, is leading the effort.
The fullest demonstration of the possibilities inherent in an adequately financed business improvement district is coming from the Grand Central district. The physical improvements it is ushering in will probably not be in place for a year or two. It is doing work beyond what the Government can offer, but to succeed it needs cooperation from city government, especially from the police, sanitation and transportation departments. Mr. Biederman praised their cooperation.
The district embraces 50 midtown blocks with 220 properties and about 51 million square feet of commercial space. Property owners are assessed 12.4 cents a square foot, which New York City bills, collects and rechannels to the partnership. The $6.33 million it brings in is supplemented by $2.4 million from other sources.
Going further, the partnership raised $32.3 million in bond financing last year. About a third of the assessments on the property owners are set aside to pay for the debt.
The same technique was used in August for the 34th Street district. There, 240 properties embrace 31 million square feet of office and residential space and 2.5 million square feet of retail space.
The assessment of 19 cents a square foot, discounted somewhat for the major retail complexes, was enough to raise $6 million the first year. About 30 percent of this pays debt on a $24.1 million bond issue. The bonds from both districts were rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service.
The Grand Central district has a staff of 34 street sweepers and maintenance people. Its 44 uniformed, unarmed security people operate shifts seven days a week from 7 A.M. to 11 P.M., with 8 to 15 on the job at a time.
The tasks of security personnel include helping the flow of traffic at taxi stands and assisting tourists in getting taxis at rail and bus terminals. That narrows the opportunities for cheats who take money for the service but do not provide it.
OVER the next four years the Grand Central district will spend $30 million on new street lighting, pale-red granite street corners and curbing, trash receptacles, flagpoles and trees. The testing ground for much of this is Vanderbilt Avenue from 42d to 43d Streets, and 43d Street from Vanderbilt to Fifth Avenue.
The emphasis is on white lighting and lots of it. At the corners there will be 400-watt metal halide lamps mounted on steel stanchions 29 feet high. Along the block will be double white-halide lamps on stanchions only 16 feet high. There will be a lamp every 30 to 60 feet.
Low height brings lighting closer to pedestrians. White lights have a shorter life than the yellow-orange sodium lamps the city uses but are more pedestrian-friendly. The improvement district will provide the replacement lamps when necessary.
"With the rise of the automobile, traffic engineers were in the driver's seat on lighting," said Arthur Rosenblatt, the vice president of the Grand Central Partnership in charge of capital programs. "Unfortunately they lost interest in the needs of a pedestrian on a darkened evening."
All this will enable Grand Central ultimately to say in promotional literature, "Come locate in the gorgeous Grand Central district." The 34th Street district is working in the same direction; so far the major change is in sanitation services and cleaning up grafitti.
The most ambitious social-service task in the midtown districts is directed at homelessness. Jeffrey Grunberg, vice president for social services, presides over a staff of 135, most of them formerly homeless. About half are getting stipends during a four- to six-month training period. Of the 65 full-time staff members, 45 are former homeless people earning $10,000 to $30,000 a year.
Staff members, wearing shirts and ties, and jackets that identify them as "outreach" workers, approach street people with inducements to start on the road to social adjustment and employment. They have roused 700 sleeping homeless people since March 1991 and sought to bring them, as a first step, to the partnership's multi-service center in the former St. Agnes High School for Boys, at 152 East 44th Street.
Once a month these 5 A.M. wake-ups are coordinated with a network fair run by the 34th Street Partnership, at which homeless people can choose among assistance programs offered by social services agencies.
Since 1989, 6,000 homeless people have walked through the door at St. Agnes. How many of them are still homeless the partnership says it has no way of knowing. On any given day, 300 people use the center. About a third are staff or trainees. The rest are there to see social workers or for a meal and companionship.
ROUGHLY 150 former homeless people hired by the partnership have left its employment with better-paying, full-time jobs, Mr. Grunberg said.
Improvement districts have been tailoring their activities to their specific needs. The 14th Street-Union Square district has emphasized safety and sanitation. It has a budget of $800,000 and covers 148 properties.
The Times Square district is aiding tourists and also tackling homelessness. "We've identified the 'Times Square 33,' " Ms. Dykstra said. They are permanent street dwelllers. The challenge is to persuade them to do better.
The problems of the downtown are not basically quality of life issues, though the streets are certainly dark and ominous at night and there are sanitation and park-maintenance issues. Every little bit of betterment helps.

HEADLINE: Q and A

 BODY:

Satisfying Arrears On a Condominium
 
Q. I own a condo in New York City. Because of the recession, I am behind in my mortgage and maintenance and have filed for bankruptcy. The trustee in my case has abandoned the real estate because there is no equity. 
 Recently, though, I discussed a reaffirmation of the mortgage. The condo board, however, demands that I make a full satisfaction of my arrears to them. Am I not discharged from owing the money to the association? . . . Joan Fiore, Huntington, L.I.
 
A. According to Ronald A. Sher, a lawyer in White Plains, the treatment and dischargeability of condominium common charges and assessments has differed in the courts.
He added, though, that most lawyers would advise that parties holding liens, including condominium associations, may foreclose on those liens and end your possession of the condominium even if the arrearage has been discharged by the bankruptcy court.
 
Finding Financing For Smaller Co-ops
 
Q. Five years ago, I purchased a 550-square-foot studio co-op in Forest Hills for $52,000. The mortgage is unassumable and the bank will not refinance properties less than 600 square feet. I was also told that most banks now will not finance apartments that are less than 600 square feet in Queens.
I am considering paying down this mortgage. Should I decide to sell the property within the next year or two, how will a purchaser obtain financing? Is there anything I can do besides hold the mortgage myself? . . . M. McNulty, Forest Hills, Queens
 
A. Yes. Try using a mortgage broker to find a bank that does refinance mortgages for co-ops under 600 square feet, said Mitchell A. Steinberg, assistant vice president at the Apple Bank for Savings in Manhattan. Also, he added, your bank may reconsider its decision not to refinance if you pay down your mortgage.
Mr. Steinberg suggested that buyers offer to finance the purchase themselves, or they can inquire whether the sale qualifies for a loan from the State of New York Mortgage Agency, known as Sonyma. The agency finances co-ops of 500 square feet and larger, depending on location and other factors.
 
Can a Landlord Shut Off Water at Night?
 
Q. Does the landlord in a rent-stabilized building have the right to turn off the water between midnight and 6 A.M.? Does the landlord have the right to keep the water pressure so low that when washing the dishes or taking a shower the water runs out with no force? Does the landlord have the right to turn down the water pressure between 9 A.M. and 5 P.M. on the assumption that no one is in residdence and doesn't need any water? . . . Jacqueline Edwards, Manhattan
 
A. No. According to Michael Finder, a lawyer in Manhattan, you should call the Department of Housing Preservation and Development at (212) 487-4545 and ask for code enforcement.

HEADLINE: Whitman Pins Hopes On Women

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN, outfoxed at nearly every turn during the summer by the wily incumbent, hopes to unseat Gov. Jim Florio on Tuesday with a late appeal to female voters.
In the final week of campaigning, Mrs. Whitman's commercials prominently featured women, and the candidate began mentioning more often in debates and speeches that she is the mother of two teen-agers. 
 Early on, Mrs. Whitman's candidacy was expected to mobilize women interested in electing the state's first female chief executive. That posed a problem for Florio campaign strategists, who were worried about how forcefully they could run against a woman without appearing to beat up on her. But Mrs. Whitman relieved their anxiety by handing them a series of issues that they could easily exploit.
Among the first was her admission that she had paid more than $22,000 in back taxes for two undocumented immigrants who had worked for her. She was also fined $2,000 by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for hiring the pair. Every chance he got, Mr. Florio, a Democrat, said Mrs. Whitman, a Republican, had been "found guilty of violating the law" and "fined by the I.R.S." (instead of the I.N.S.) for the incident. His comments fed the belief by many women that Mrs. Whitman was a rich woman who could afford to pay for such things, while they could not.
By mid-October, the Florio camp had managed to usurp much of Mrs. Whitman's credibility on many issues important to voters, including violent crime, welfare reform and taxes.
"She failed early on to establish an identity for herself," said Neil Upmeyer, president of the Center for the Analysis of Public Issues, a Princeton-based policy study group. "And that brought about a second problem. When it came time to make her sales pitch for her economic recovery plan, nobody knew who she was and her message lacked credibility."
While Mrs. Whitman was conserving her campaign finances, the Florio campaign was filling in the blanks in the public's perception of the Republican challenger. Mr. Florio was able to picture Mrs. Whitman as a willing tool of the National Rifle Association when she criticized his ban on assault weapons, one of the most popular initiatives of Mr. Florio's term in office.
"The strongest image of the campaign was a Florio ad that had a picture of her in goggles and ear protectors that are used by people who are out shooting rifles," Mr. Upmeyer said. "Without having to say a word, it added credibility to the argument that she is in the pocket of the N.R.A."
Not surprisingly, independent public opinion surveys showed Mrs. Whitman trailing Mr. Florio among female voters, and her campaign aides said she must recapture their support if she is to have a chance of victory.
A recent Star-Ledger/Eagleton poll at Rutgers University found that Mrs. Whitman was favored by men of voting age by 49 to 43 percent. Mr. Florio was preferred by 61 to 31 percent among all women who could vote. His lead among Republican women was 28 percentage points over Mrs. Whitman and among independent female voters, 11 percentage points.
The poll used the responses of 601 likely voters in reporting Mr. Florio's margin among female voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.5 percent.
A New York Times/WCBS-TV News Poll a few days later reported that Mr. Florio was preferred by both male (51 to 35 percent) and female (47 to 34 percent) voters. The poll surveyed 1,153 people, of whom 925 said they were registered to vote. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percent.
Of course, last-minute polls, not to mention the election itself, could still show a large enough shift by voters to give Mrs. Whitman all that she needs.
 
Legislative Seats at Stake
 New Jersey voting booths will be open from 7 A.M. to 8 P.M. Tuesday. Also up for election are all 120 seats in the Legislature. Republicans hold veto-proof majorities of 27 to 13 in the Senate and 58 to 22 in the Assembly, which they won in the 1991 election on a voter backlash against Governor Florio's $2.8 billion tax program.
Hazel Gluck, a co-chairwoman of the Whitman campaign, said no woman has won public office without winning the women's vote. The question in these closing days, is whether the renewed appeal to women and Mrs. Whitman's attempt to define herself in terms of some so-called women's issues come too late.
Susan Carroll, a senior research associate at the Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers, said the Florio campaign's success in depicting Mrs. Whitman as someone whose wealth put her out of touch with the concerns of ordinary citizens kept her on the defensive almost until the end.
Ms. Carroll also said public opinion polls across the country have found that women are more willing to support female candidates for legislative seats than for the job of chief executive of a state. "The key problem seems to be older women voters," she said. "Perhaps that was because they were socialized in a very different era when there were limits on what a woman could and would do."
She said, however, that Mrs. Whitman "had a real chance to attract crossover votes from independent and Democratic women, particularly well-educated professional women." She said this group might have more strongly supported Mrs. Whitman because she is a moderate Republican, but said her proposal to cut state income taxes by 30 percent over three years damaged her appeal.
"When her tax plan seemed to be a holdover from the era of Reaganomics, it became a very difficult thing for progressive women, including some of those leaning toward the Democratic Party, to swallow," Ms. Carroll said.
 
Gubernatorial Races Reviewed
 Kathleen A. Frankovic, director of surveys for CBS News, said a review of five gubernatorial races in 1990 in which women were running showed that when the female candidate was a Democrat, the tendency of women to vote Democratic was enhanced, but when the female candidate was a Republican, there was no difference in the percentage of votes cast for either candidate by men or women.
For his part, Mr. Florio followed the traditional Democrats' end game of trying to energize elderly and minority voters. The appeal to black voters, which followed an endorsement by a statewide coalition of black members of the clergy, was channeled chiefly through urban churches.
Some black elected officials, though, including Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, have criticized both the Democratic and Republican campaigns, saying they have ignored the needs of the cities. "The words 'urban, disadvantaged or Afro-American' are missing from this year's campaign literature," Mr. James said.
He said he understood that in this state the campaign is largely waged for the suburban voter, but he said the decision not to campaign in urban neighborhoods and ask residents directly for their support could hold down voter turnout.
If the vote is light in the urban counties, and if Bret Schundler, Jersey City's Republican Mayor, is able to deliver his city's vote to Mrs. Whitman as he has promised, then the outcome could be much closer than expected.
 
Rehashing Tax Issues
 The candidates for the Legislature have been rehashing the 1990 tax increase and the Republican majority's 1992 rollback of the penny increase in the sale tax that was part of Mr. Florio's package.
Republicans argue that they redeemed their pledge to roll back the taxes through the elimination of the penny increase in the sales tax, which cut state revenue by about $600 million. The Democrats charge that the Republicans really accepted $2.2 billion of the increase by not following through and repealing the balance of Mr. Florio's program.
In the campaign's last full week, Republican leaders, including Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian of Independence Township, have tried to revive the public's fears about taxes by contending that the Democrats will again try to raise the sales tax to 7 cents from 6 cents if they regain strength in the Legislature.
The Senate minority leader, Senator John A. Lynch, Democrat of New Brunswick, denied any such plan to raise the sales tax and attributed Mr. Haytaian's comments to "runaway hysteria."
Mr. Lynch said Democrats should pick up several of the seats in nominally Democratic districts that were lost in 1991. Much of his optimism is based on surveys that indicate greater public acceptance of Mr. Florio's tax package, which the Governor said was needed to finance public schools and close a budget deficit. If Mr. Florio should win big, something that is far from certain, Mr. Lynch said Democrats could capture the eight seats needed to regain control of the Senate.
While Democrats are given an outside chance of winning the Senate even if there is a Florio landslide, it seems unlikely that the Assembly will change hands because of the top-heavy majority enjoyed by the Republicans.
 
Recall Amendment on Ballot
 In addition to deciding the races for Governor and the Legislature, voters have the chance to give themselves the ability to recall elected officials.
The recall amendment to the State Constitution is the only question on the statewide ballot. It would permit voters to recall officials from the municipal to the state level after they have served one year in office.
The referendum was a last-minute substitute for a proposed initiative and referendum amendment that would give the public a direct vote on setting state policy. After pledging to adopt such a system in the 1991 campaign, Republican leaders had second thoughts and placed the recall amendment on the ballot instead.
In the closing days of the campaign, the League of Women Voters and New Jersey Common Cause, the public interest organization, joined in opposing the referendum, saying it was probably unconstitutional, would increase the cost of campaigns since there is no limit on spending for public questions and would diminish the ability of officeholders to make difficult decisions.
"We already have the power to recall elected officials, on Election Day," said Lucy Heller, government director of the League of Women Voters. "It is ludicrous to suggest that voters should judge anyone's performance after one year in office."
Senator John H. Dorsey, Republican of Boonton, and a sponsor of the recall amendment, said 168 municipalities and 6 counties already had the right to recall their elected officials. "It's absurd to deny this right to the rest of the voters," he said. Residents of 15 other states also have the right to recall elected officials, he said.

HEADLINE: Bottle Collecting: Pieces of the Past Worth Digging Deep For

BYLINE: By HELEN PIKE

DATELINE: SOUTH AMBOY

 BODY:
SOMEWHERE under dense overgrowth in this industrial Raritan Bay town, Glenn Vogel and Glenn Harbour are digging through the ash, clay, sand and rusting metal of history.
For more than six hours, the slow, rhythmic work is punctuated by odd bits of nursery rhymes and nonsense songs that float up from a 15-foot hole in the abandoned dump. Mr. Vogel and Mr. Harbour estimate they are digging down as far as 1895. Scattered around the opening are the remains of leather boots, wooden buckets, porcelain bowls and eight-inch-long oyster shells -- all of which they have dug up and none of which interest them. 
 Only when the clink of metal against glass occurs does the site erupt with whoops of glee as they gently unearth what they are searching for: turn-of-the-century hand blown bottles.
Although Mr. Vogel's and Mr. Harbour's passion for glass may seem obsessive, they are not alone in collecting the old-fashioned containers that used to hold any liquid from bromides to beer.
 
Experiencing a Resurgence
 Every 10 years, often concurrent with a recession, bottle collecting experiences a resurgence, said Isabel Sherwood of Toms River, an officer of the national Federation of Historic Bottle Collectors and a one-time digger.
The current interest has been building for about three years, she said. The Jersey Shore Bottle Club, to which she, Mr. Vogel and Mr. Harbour belong, counts its membership in terms of families. Recently, it added 20 new members to its longstanding core of 70.
Mrs. Sherwood further estimates that the region has about 475 individual collectors who regularly get together to trade, buy, exhibit and share historical information.
 
'Often a Family Affair'
 There are three clubs in the state affiliated with the federation: the North Jersey Bottle Collectors Association in Oakland, the Heritage Club in Vineland and the Jersey Shore Club, which meets monthly in Belmar. There is also a nonfederation bottle collectors' club in New Egypt.
"Collecting, even digging for bottles, is often a family affair," said Mrs. Sherwood, who occasionally helps her husband, Stanley, with his collections of milk bottles and glass balls that were once used for target shooting.
One reason for the passion of collecting bottles is that they are relatively inexpensive. Some sell for as little as a few cents at a yard sale while others are found. These discoveries often lead the would-be collector to library talks given by established collectors, bottle shows and club meetings.
The most frequently asked questions are: What used to be in the bottles? Where were they made? Who made them? Why are they colored? How can I find more like this one?
That is usually how a collection gets started, said Mrs. Sherwood, who began with fruit jars and now also collects pickle jars. Style, color, maker, location and former content, like perfume, medicine, poison, bitters, soda and even olive oil, become the framework on which to build a collection.
Many collectors print handouts of the research that they have tirelessly gleaned from libraries, county historical archives and even courthouse records. Some collectors branch out, looking for vintage postcards and sepia-toned photographs in an effort to identify business locations and the faces of the entrepreneurs whose bottles they now own. Still others seek out advertising labels to match their bottles.
"It brings me back in time," said Bob Randolph, a Manasquan auctioneer who was one of 150 exhibitors at the recent fall show of the Jersey Shore Club. Back in time also means when he was a youngster growing up in Neptune and ignorantly smashing blob-topped and hutch-topped bottles he uncovered in a Shark River creek bed.
Today, those vintage bottles whose tops indicate how they were sealed fetch $45 and more, Mr. Randolph said with a shake of his head. He said bottles were once again setting records at auctions and private sales, as they did in the 1970's.
"Color is king," he said. "It's dictating the price." A bottle in amber or light yellow or greenish blue can, even if its shape is plain, command 10 times the price of a more ordinary bottle, he said.
After color comes age, Mr. Randolph added. Bottles made before 1870 are much sought after because few have survived and most were crudely made before manufacturing techniques evolved.
The last criterion is category, and, Mr. Randolph said, flasks head collectors' wish lists. They are followed by soda bottles and then colored pontils, named for the indentation in the base that is made when the blow pipe is removed from the finished glass container.
But even though prices at auction can climb as high as $42,000 for a single bottle, Mr. Randolph was quick to point out that fortunes are not made overnight.
"People spend years developing an eye for detail and color gradations," he said. "They start with dollar bottles and work their way up. If a category gets out of range for them, they try to develop another one that hasn't been discovered. It's really a form of treasure hunting. But nobody should quit their day job."
All of which is of little importance to Chris Tobin, 12, of Forked River.
"I like the odd stuff," Chris said, "different shapes, different colors."
Chris was one of the 500 individuals -- 100 more than last year -- who attended a bottle show at Toms River High School North. His purchase for the day was a 50-cent gum dish from Millville Art Glass, a cranberry-colored disk made by Ed Johnson, a retired glass-mold maker.
Chris's biggest investment to date is a $5 cranberry bottle he found during an antique furniture foray with his mother, Connie, who regularly attends shows and yard sales. Chris said he has yet to dig for bottles but may do so eventually.
Rita and Howard Morgan of Howell have stopped digging because they now have a 2 1/2-year-old son, Christopher. But they came to the bottle show looking for glass flasks, ice-cream soda bottles and mason jars. They have even begun a glass-train bottle collection for their son.
When he gets older, the couple may dig again, taking the child with them, Mrs. Morgan said. But if they do, it will be with caution. One outing netted them each $60 fines for trespassing, she said.
"I think it was a high amount to discourage us," Mrs. Morgan said. "But the farmer didn't even give us time to explain ourselves before he called the police."
 
Taking Inventory
 Meanwhile, back at the dump, Mr. Vogel and Mr. Harbour were taking inventory. Whenever they find a large, promising site, they observe the buddy system to avoid cave-in related accidents. They also rarely dig in the summer when it is the height of tick and chigger season. And they usually confine their digs to open land or abandoned sites, like former dumps.
"I'm looking for color to fill out my collection," said Mr. Harbour, a painting preservationist, who found a honey-amber shoe-polish bottle at the dig.
On the open market, the bottle would go for about $10, he said, but for this amateur archeologist, the value lies in having found a bottle that will now be part of his private collection.
Besides color, Mr. Harbour is also putting together a collection based on the Bayshore region from South Amboy to Highlands. To date, he has gathered a small -- 250-item -- but impressive variety of medicine, cider, milk, beer and soda bottles, along with broken stoneware crocks he has meticulously glued back together. He exhibits his findings at libraries and museums in the area.
 
A Journey Into the Past
 "Americans used to live out of glass," said Mr. Harbour, a Middletown resident who actively promotes glass-related events at the Spy House, a Revolutionary-era museum on the Raritan Bay in the township's Port Monmouth section. "Their medicine, their food, even their advertising used to be on glass."
Mr. Vogel, an Eatontown-area historian who works at Fort Monmouth, said, "Every bottle represents a little journey into the past."
At the dig he found little of interest other than a pale lavender machine-made Eiffel Tower Fruit Juice bottle. "It's the first time I've ever seen one of these," he said.
The bottle will probably go into his sale pile. Mr. Vogel, who owns more than 600 bottles, concentrates on handblown beers and sodas from the 1860's, even though he owns some machine-made bottles that first appeared in 1903.
"It's all about owning a little piece of history," he said.
His favorite part of his collection is the bottles of William A. French of Red Bank, a bottler who, Mr. Vogel discovered, was one of the five wealthiest men in New Jersey in 1900. His French collection features 47 different bottles so far.
"We're local historians who use bottles to tell the stories of an area," Mr. Vogel said. "If we don't do it now, soon it will be lost forever."

HEADLINE: Last-Minute Look At the Candidates

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
WESTCHESTER voters will participate in a major changing of the guard on Tuesday, Election Day, filling the soon-to-be-vacant posts of district attorney and county clerk. Voters will also decide whether to replace the incumbent County Executive.
After one of the most bitterly contested political campaigns in recent memory, voters will also select a new Board of Legislators as well as host of mayors, supervisors, council members, judges and other municipal officials. 
Polls will be open from 6 A.M. to 9 P.M. For information about voting, the number to call is 285-5700.
Rarely has there been so much uncertainty in so many top-level posts. The office of district attorney, occupied for 25 years by Carl A. Vergari, a Republican who is retiring, has attracted two qualified candidates who have conducted a harsh campaign, accusing each other, among other things, of accepting "mob-tainted" campaign funds.
The candidates are Jeanine Ferris Pirro, a 42-year-old Republican and former assistant district attorney who gave up a County Court judgeship to accept the nomination, and Michael G. Cherkasky, a Democrat, who rose in the office of Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, to become one of his chief prosecutors.
Mrs. Pirro, who created and ran the Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Bureau under Mr. Vergari, has sought to persuade voters that Mr. Cherkasky, 43, is an outsider and therefore unfamiliar with law enforcement in the county. Mr. Cherkasky was born in White Plains and has lived in Larchmont for seven years. Mrs. Pirro is a lifelong resident of Westchester.
Mr. Cherkasky, who says the law is the same in Manhattan and Westchester, was chief of the investigation division in Mr. Morgenthau's office when he left, supervising 75 lawyers and 150 investigators and police officers. He had a budget of $14 million, which was $2 million larger than that of the entire Westchester District Attorney's office.
The Right to Life Party candidate is John J. Barry.
The office of county clerk, which is Westchester's records keeper, is becoming vacant because its four-term occupant, Andrew J. Spano, the first Democrat to hold the office in this century, decided after a decade of service to seek higher office. He was aiming for the county's top post, that of county executive, held for 11 years by Andrew P. O'Rourke, a Republican.
It was not Mr. Spano's first bid for this powerful office. He made a similar effort four years ago but was persuaded to back off in favor of Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, who was thought by county Democratic leaders to have a better chance to unseat the popular Mr. O'Rourke.
Mr. Brodksy ran and lost, by 6 percentage points, and Mr. Spano returned to his job, modernizing and computerizing the county clerk office. Then, last year, the two rivals began gearing up for another challenge.
 
No Debate in Clerk Race
 Mr. Spano thought he had an agreement with Mr. Brodsky that if the Assemblyman lost in the 1989 race, then it would be Mr. Spano's turn to be the candidate. Mr. Brodsky said no such pact existed. Defying Mr. Spano and the Democratic leadership, who endorsed the Spano candidacy, Mr. Brodsky forced a primary race and narrowly won.
Meanwhile, Mr. Spano's soon-to-be-vacant office has attracted two major candidates, the Eastchester town supervisor, James P. Doody, a Democrat, and County Legislator Leonard N. Spano, a Republican who is not related to Andrew Spano, the outgoing incumbent.
The race for county clerk has consisted of each candidate's putting forward proposals for how he would enhance Andrew Spano's improvements. The candidates have not engaged in any debates, however, largely because Leonard Spano has declined to do so. He says he has made more than 200 personal appearances, none with Mr. Doody.
The Right to Life Party candidate is Robert J. Walsh.
 
O'Rourke vs. Brodsky
 The major race is for county executive, with Mr. O'Rourke's saying that he continues to provide AAA-style government, a reference to the top bond rating that Westchester executives have long taken pride in maintaining.
He says Mr. Brodsky is unsuitable for the job and does not have the right temperament. Mr. Brodsky says Mr. O'Rourke has become weary in his 11 years in office and, in fact, had not expected to be running this year.
Mr. O'Rourke was nominated by President Bush for a Federal judgeship, but the Senate, which must confirm nominations, did not consider it before the 1992 Presidential election effectively doomed Republican nominees.
Mr. Brodsky has also campaigned strenuously on the ethics-in-government issue, picking up where he left off in the 1989 campaign when he sought, largely unsuccessfully, to associate Mr. O'Rourke with donations that concessionaires at Playland, the county-run amusement park in Rye, had to pay to the Republican Party to win contracts.
During this campaign, Mr. Brodsky has benefited from newspaper articles s about favors Mr. O'Rourke evidently sought to provide in the form of jobs and contracts to companies employing members of his family and close friends.
 
Unemployment a Key Issue
 Mr. Vergari, the Republican District Attorney, and a grand jury looked into the alleged misdeeds and failed to bring charges or to indict, saying no laws were broken. Mr. O'Rourke has cited these findings as evidence that he did nothing wrong. Mr. Brodsky says the standard of ethics in government should be higher than "I was not indicted."
Both candidates have put forward plans to help relieve unemployment problems, which Mr. O'Rourke minimizes by saying the unemployment rate in the county is 5.7 percent and Mr. Brodsky maximizes by noting that the county has lost jobs in 47 of the last 50 months -- 40,000 jobs in all, two-thirds of them white-collar.
Both have put forward plans for job training: Mr. Brodsky is proposing white-collar retraining and a small-business start-up center, and Mr. O'Rourke has recently opened a so-called one-stop shopping center, which offers outplacement assistance and a public-private partnership to provide a marketing plan.
They have disagreed over taxes, with Mr. O'Rourke seeking to associate Mr. Brodsky with "tax-and-spend liberals in Albany." He said his Democratic rival voted yes on 96 of 98 spending and tax bills and walked out of the chamber for the key vote on the budget to avoid being associated with its passage.
Mr. Brodsky said Mr. O'Rourke manipulated county taxes, producing three consecutive years of no increase, including next year's, to coincide with the election campaign. The premature release of the 1994 budget, before Election Day, an action the O'Rourke administration had previously resisted, was labeled by Mr. Brodsky as a political move.
The Right to Life candidate is Noreen E. Donohue.
 
17 Legislator Seats at Stake
 The entire Board of Legislators faces election this year, with the Republicans hoping to maintain their control and the Democrats seeking to regain the majority they say they won at the polls last time but lost in the legislative chamber.
When the votes were counted in the 1991 election, there were eight Democrats, eight Republicans and Suzanne R. Swanson, a Thornwood Conservative who won election running as a Democrat. After much pressure from both parties, she sided with the Republicans in selecting a chairman and organizing committees.
Since then, two Democratic legislators, Sandra R. Galef of Ossining and Audrey G. Hochberg of Scarsdale, have been elected to the State Assembly and have been replaced by Republicans by the Republican-controlled board.
Two races are being watched carefully. Vying for the Ossining seat are two former Ossining Supervisors, Richard G. Wishnie, a Democrat, and Barbara C. Fratianni, a Republican and Conservative. They are seeking to replace Mark S. Tulis, a Republican who had been appointed to replace Mrs. Galef but decided not to seek election. The Right to Life candidate is Paul Rossney.
 
Three-Way Mayoral Race
 The legislator selected to replace Mrs. Hochberg, Pearl C. Quarles, a Republican and former school board president in New Rochelle, is being challenged by Lois T. Bronz, a Democrat who served eight terms as a Greenburgh Council member before moving to White Plains. Charmaine R. Thomas of White Plains is the Conservative and Right to Life candidate.
One of the most interesting races is for mayor of White Plains, where the 18-year incumbent, Alfred Del Vecchio, is seeking re-election on the Conservative line, having lost the Republican primary, to his surprise, to Michael A. Coffey, an 18-year-member of the Common Council.
Likely to benefit from this split is the Democratic candidate, Sy J. Schulman, a one-term Councilman and former president of the Westchester County Association, which represents major employers.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Betting On The Baby Boom Bull Market

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
"THE baby boomers are doing to the stock market what they did to the housing market."
That quote, from Claudia Mott, the small-capitalization stock guru at Prudential Securities, sums up the best long-term bullish case now available for the stock market. And it may prove to be right. 
 The baby boomers -- the children born in the years immediately following World War II -- have provided excessive demand all their lives. In the 1950's and 1960's, they forced construction of new schools, then colleges.
Then came the surge in demand for housing, pushing home prices to unprecedented levels. Value-sensitive investors, examining such things as ratios of housing prices to income, concluded prices were ridiculously high, and some decided to sell their homes and rent. But prices kept rising anyway as investors bet the trend would continue indefinitely. The value players appeared to have been dead wrong.
Eventually the housing market reversed, with the biggest declines in areas where the price inflation had been the greatest. Prices were too high, and there were fewer families being formed. Those who leaped in too late ended with big losses.
Now, the aging baby boomers are discovering that they must save for retirement, and at a time when interest rates are down. "We are pulling in a lot of inexperienced investors," says Christian Thwaites, a vice president of Aetna mutual funds, speaking of the firm's retirement account business, which is concentrated in such areas as hospital and local government employees. A year ago, he reports, about 30 percent of such retirement money went into stock funds. Now it is 50 percent. And more money is going into speculative stock funds.
At the same time, value investors are looking askance at the stock market, as they once did at the housing market. In housing they were eventually proved right, but only after the demographic trends were played out. If Ms. Mott is right, stock prices could levitate for years, until the baby boomers start trying to cash out. But the economy could stay weak, as demand is held down by a shift from consumption to saving. Rising prices would give American corporations access to cheaper capital, providing a competitive advantage for them.
It is easier to print new shares of stock than it is to build houses, so the rising supply of stock could create a digestion problem for the market at any time. And no doubt there will be scandals as some brokerage firms and money managers show more interest in their own wealth than in that of their customers.
If the baby-boom bull market theory proves false, its downfall will probably be traceable to the assumption that Americans will increase their savings for a prolonged period. But those -- including this columnist -- who tend to focus on value may be surprised by just how long it takes for the market to return to the old value benchmarks. If so, it will be fun while it lasts, and that could be for years.

THE ECONOMY
 
A Plan Is Born. Now, Watch Out!
O.K., it's 1,342 pages, and it's so complicated that to try to understand it all could put you in need of some heavy-duty health care. But look at it this way, President Clinton said, as he plunked his mammoth health care plan in Congress' lap last week: "None of us could devise a system more complex, more burdensome, more administratively costly than the one we have now." He's got a point there. But then again, the present system wasn't built in a day, and he's trying to create a brand new labyrinth in a single stroke. The plan has evolved during its months of gestation, notably in new limits on Government subsidies -- an attempt to allay fears that Big Government will take on an unworkable burden. But for all the talk of his waffling, all the plan's revisions, he's stuck to one razor-sharp goal: "health care security for all Americans." 

Is It the Clinton Economy Yet?
Things economic take a while to sort themselves out, but at some point we'll have to start talking about the Clinton economy. Maybe it's time. President Clinton clearly thinks so, saying he sees sparks of a true rebound. He'd gladly take credit for last week's figures, data that showed quarterly growth at a strong 2.8 percent annual rate and inflation at just a 1.8 percent rate. Of course, if different numbers had appeared on the dice, someone might have blamed Bush-era policies.
 
The revival has skipped some places, like California. But, sadly, there will be a lot of rebuilding there soon, so if there's a silver lining to last week's horrifying fires, it's that construction could give the state a lift.
 
Not a Cruel Month at All
Well, the stock market survived October, and survived it in style. In the past, it's been a cruel month -- in 1987, say, and in 1989. So with prices already high, investors tiptoed into October, ready to head for the exit at the drop of a statistic. But the statistics were good, and the Dow industrials closed out the month with two records in a week. The Dow nudged another barrier, 3,700, before ending at 3,680.
 
COMPANIES
 
Paramount Isn't Sitting Still
Paramount isn't exactly sitting around eating popcorn while those folks with billions to burn decide who's going to buy the company. Quite the contrary. Last week it said it was teaming up with Chris-Craft to start a fifth television network. They plan to do it much the way Fox did in 1986: combine stations, buy some more, and get into more homes via cable. But here's where the whole interlocking mess gets tricky: If Paramount winds up with its chosen suitor, Viacom, then Tele-Communications, a prime backer of rival bidder QVC, will not be happy. So T.C.I., as the nation's biggest cable operator, could make life difficult for the infant network. Call in Captain Kirk and Dr. Spock! Which, in fact, is what Paramount plans to do: The cornerstone of the new network is another "Star Trek" series.
 
Speaking of that takeover battle, the billions keep flying, and now the lawsuits do too. After Viacom matched its $10 billion bid, QVC asked a court to block Paramount from merging with Viacom. Then, to add more spice, there was talk that BellSouth might jump into the bidding. Warp 3, here we come!
 
G.M. Coddles the Auto Workers
General Motors is selling more cars these days, but it had better hope sales get even better. It said last week that car sales rose a powerful 20 percent in the last 10 selling days. But this news was dwarfed by G.M.'s settlement with the U.A.W. The company badly needed union concessions -- especially on pensions, where it has dug itself into a hole, and on health care, where, amazingly, it still pays it all. But G.M., eager to be buddy-buddy with labor, walked away with no concessions.
 
Ford Sings, G.M. Doesn't
Last week was also earnings week, and the numbers served to underscore Detroit's new pecking order. Ford said it earned $463 million in the quarter, while G.M. posted a $113 million loss. The expectation gap was even wider, for there was immediate carping that Ford could earn even more if it weren't offering so many rebates. In contrast, at G.M. the expectations were so bleak Wall Street was actually impressed by such a small (small?) loss, and the company's stock rose a bit, ending the week at $47.625.
 
A Tough Choice for VW Workers
While the auto news is mixed in Detroit, it's just plain bad in Germany. Volkswagen is hurting -- sales are weak, German wages are high. Last week it tried a radical approach, giving workers a choice between a four-day week (with lower pay) and 30,000 lost jobs.
 
Motorola's Loss, Kodak's Gain
Old ways die hard, old corporate ways die even harder, but last week Kodak joined the venerable companies -- from I.B.M. on down -- that are shedding their inbred ways by looking outside for new bosses. Kodak's choice was a surprise: George M.C. Fisher, who has led Motorola to solid growth in recent years, and who has been called by one analyst "a hard-hitting, tough, cost-conscious executive." He replaces Kay R. Whitmore, dismissed because directors felt he wouldn't make the hard choices, and hard changes, needed. Mr. Fisher's electronics expertise is seen as a plus in this age of higher and higher tech, and Kodak stock leapt on the news of his selection, ending the week at $62.875. And what drew him away from Motorola, where there was no hint that he'd jump ship? No one would talk salary, but Mr. Fisher did say he got an "extraordinary offer."
 
Merck Tries to Buy Some Loyalty
Many employees are not feeling loyal these days. Why should they, with colleagues being laid off right and left? Drug makers are feeling special pressure as political scrutiny of drug prices mounts. So last week Merck tossed its workers a bone -- the ones who are left, anyway (Merck has done its fair share of job pruning). In a gesture Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, the chairman, said was meant to show "we are confident about our future," Merck is giving all 37,000 employees an option to buy 300 of its shares for $32.50 each. That would have been a good deal a year ago, when the stock was around $45, but it's now about $32.
 
A Lot of Takers at Prudential
A lot of people out there must feel that Prudential Securities owes them something. After Prudential settled charges of defrauding customers by setting aside $330 million to pay them back, callers last week flooded a toll-free line set up by regulators. It's a 24-hour line, so if you awake at 2 a.m. angry about the limited partnerships you bought, that's a good time to call. (The number: 1-800-220-9125.)
 
The scandal is reaching into Prudential's past.Word came last week that George L. Ball, who headed Prudential until 1991, was leaving his job at Smith Barney. Mr. Ball reportedly is being investigated for his role at Prudential, and Smith Barney apparently didn't want its own reputation tarnished.
 
Tokyo's Explosive New Stock
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has been battered for several years as the Japanese miracle has turned less miraculous, so Japan wants to restore investor confidence. It didn't do it last week. Newly listed shares of the Government railroad, the East Japan Railway, were meant to prove that the market was solid. They did just the opposite. First, so many investors wanted to buy the shares that it sucked money from other stocks and clogged the computers. When a new day dawned, everyone tried to grab quick profits. The stock plunged, with more disorder, more clogged computers. Trading was halted, and the market looks more than ever like a crapshoot.
 
R.S.I.? There's No Such Thing
Great news! Those of you who work on keyboards and have numbness or pain in hands or wrists can throw out those wrist braces and ice packs, and shelve the Advil. In a journalist's lawsuit, a British judge said last week that repetitive stress injuries do not exist.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Could Canada Sidetrack Nafta?
It'll be quite a feat if the North American Free Trade Agreement ever becomes reality, because it's at the mercy of three countries' political winds. It's as if you were sweeping up feathers, and just when you got most of them cornered, another would insolently flutter away. And so it must have seemed to Nafta's supporters in Washington last week when Canada's newly elected Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, said he wanted changes in the pact. So now everyone's watching the clock; if Mr. Chretien stirs things up before Congress votes in mid-November, the resulting uncertainty could be a real blow. If he holds off, the pact has a better chance.
 
Farm Ownership, Yeltsin's Way
With the legislature no longer blocking the way, Boris Yeltsin is moving to put his reformist stamp on Russia, and last week he put a big dent in a legacy from the Stalin era -- the vast network of collective farms. In signing a decree to let farm workers own and sell land, President Yeltsin challenged head-on a basic commandment of the Communist system: Citizens shall not own property.

HEADLINE: Corporate America's Diagnosis of the Clinton Health Plan

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
A BIT like prophets whose message has finally been heeded after long years of being ignored, many employee benefits executives said "amen" when President Clinton trumpeted the need to bring health costs under control and make care universally available.
But many business people fear that the changes the President sent to Congress last week may increase their costs, which are still rising at more than double the general inflation rate. 
 It is too early to predict what will come out of Congress, of course, but many employers have jumped into the battle of competing interest groups lobbying to influence the outcome before they are forced to reshape their own health plans.
Many want to keep their carefully engineered managed care programs, which rely on health maintenance organizations and networks of "preferred" doctors and hospitals that agree to play by the employers' rules.
Under the Clinton proposals, companies with fewer than 5,000 employees would have to join regional health purchasing groups, which would be responsible for cutting deals with competing local managed care groups.
The President says the employers' costs would decline because they would no longer be paying indirectly for people without insurance. But many benefits executives doubt that the new buying groups could keep the lid on costs as tightly as they could.
"We've done a lot of innovative things that we would like to continue," said Kenneth J. Reifert, benefits director for the 40,000 employees at New York-based Merrill Lynch.
Some employers would lose and others could gain. Companies with young, healthy workers, for instance, might see their premiums rise if everyone moved to a community rate.
But those companies with older workers and heavy costs for retirees would gain as the regional groups took over responsibility for retirees under age 65.
Like many employers, Merrill Lynch has shifted a growing portion of its health care costs to its employees, while offering them a choice of benefits. Now they end up paying 31 percent of the costs. But under the Clinton plan, employees would pay 20 percent and employers 80 percent.
Mr. Reifert is also concerned about the proposal for a 1 percent surtax on payroll, to cover social costs like medical education, for large employers who retain their own health plans. "For Merrill Lynch, that could increase our costs by one-third, or about $40 million, depending on how they define payroll," he said.
Would "payroll" be defined to include the stock options and bonuses, which play a big role in Wall Street pay packages? he wonders.
Some employers are taking the proposal for a 1 percent payroll tax in stride.
Rick Dreyfuss, employee benefits director of the Hershey Foods Corporation, which has 10,000 employees and more down-to-earth pay scales than some Wall Street firms, said Hershey would support the 1 percent tax for medical education.
EVEN a company with more than 5,000 employees could join one of the new regional buying groups called alliances, if the group costs seemed lower.
Some companies, in industries that place a high value on attracting skilled employees and keeping them loyal, pay for procedures like in vitro fertilization and experimental AIDS treatments, which would not be in the Clinton basic package. They could continue to do so.
"Before taking any benefit away, we would evaluate whether there was a good business reason for keeping it," said Helen Darling, manager of health care strategy and benefits at the Xerox Corporation, which covers in vitro fertilization.
A number of benefits executives said they expected to see savings from the provisions for a standard benefits package and standard claims payment forms. Some also hoped to see reduced costs for their retirees, although they would have to return some of the savings to the Government.
On the down side, the employers worried about the prospect of new bureaucracies; being forced into poorly managed regional health alliances, and facing 50 sets of state laws if they lose the Federal exemption for self-insured companies.
But much remains unclear. Mr. Reifert at Merrill Lynch thinks the Clinton Administration is using the proposals "as a straw man" to get Congress moving on health care legislation. He welcomed the President's declared openness to negotiating and compromise.
"We are in that wait-and-see mode," said Linda Lafoon, benefits manager at Ukrops Supermarkets Inc., a small family-owned regional chain based in Richmond.
Dan Heslin, employee benefits director of Rockwell International, asked, "Do we have to go as just one corporate alliance, or could we join regional alliances on an optional basis?"
Rockwell, based in Seal Beach, Calif., has 60,000 employees in 45 states. It makes aerospace products, electronics, automotive components and printing presses.
Even small employers that are struggling with soaring costs worry about the possibility of losing control over benefits programs, which many feel are essential to the morale and stability of their work force.
"I wouldn't enjoy being dictated to and being told, 'You've got to do it this way and that way,' " said Alexandrine Doesberg, risk manager at Time Equities Inc., a Manhattan real estate management company with 68 employees. Premiums, reflecting the high costs in New York and New Jersey, are $612 a month for family coverage, she said.
"If you weren't giving the proper coverage," she said, the employees "would be up in arms in here." Obviously worried about the staff's care, she added, "I'm like the mother."
Benefits executives around the country discussed their myriad hopes and fears for the Clinton plan in telephone interviews.
 
Waldorf Corporation
 Thomas S. Kalbrener, benefits manager of the Waldorf Corporation, a self-insured maker of cartons and boxboards based in St. Paul, is cautiously optimistic that: "The Clinton plan is not going to cost anywhere near as much as the naysayers are saying."
Savings will result when buyers "can compare big masses of data," he predicted. For example, he added, "It changes the way doctors practice when they find everybody is looking at how many normal infant deliveries they have, as opposed to how many Caesarean sections."
Waldorf, which has 2,000 employees in 10 states, spends $3,000 per employee and provides benefits that Mr. Kalbrener said "probably exceed" those in the Administration plan.
The company "rents" networks of doctors and hospitals at negotiated prices from Blue Cross plans in Minneapolis and other cities. He worries that some employees may be "dumped into community rated pools and will have to pay more because the community is going to decide what the cost is."
Doctors in some parts of the country do not keep a lid on spending, he said, citing his company's experiences in Iowa and North Carolina.
Mr. Kalbrener had this message for Congress and the Administration: "If they perceive that they have a system and a market that works, like we have in Minnesota, let it work, rather than force it to change dramatically."
 
Hershey Foods
 Hershey Foods, which put together a network of nine hospitals selected from 23 and associated physicians around its headquarters in Hershey, Pa., would like to phase out its traditional fee-for-service health plan, Mr. Dreyfuss, the benefits director, said.
Under the Clinton plan, companies would have to continue to offer the traditional insurance through the regional alliances. But Mr. Dreyfuss said that this type of insurance is typically chosen by the people who need the most care, ballooning costs.
"The best way to shrink the health dollar is to buy care based on the data that's available on the quality of medical outcomes," he said. Pennsylvania publishes hospital charges and reports on deaths after surgery, which Hershey used in selecting its network.
"We propose that corporations be allowed to continue their own programs," he explained. "The state could set up pools on behalf of small businesses."
Mr. Dreyfuss also questioned whether the Clinton estimates of costs were realistic. The Administration says that an employer's costs would not exceed 7.9 percent of payroll. But Hershey is currently spending more than 10 percent of payroll, he said.
 
Ukrops Supermarkets
 Linda Lafoon, at Ukrops Supermarkets in Richmond, said the Clinton plan "as it now stands, would not have a great impact" on the company's costs. But she worries about complicated reporting requirements.
Ukrops has 1,400 full-time employees and 2,900 part-timers, including many students who get their coverage in their parents' plan, and retirees with benefits from a former employer. Turnover is low, she said, partly because the employees appreciate the benefits package.
Employees pay $32, $55 or $95 a month for family coverage, depending on which health-care package they select. Annual deductibles for hospital care under the three plans are $400, $300 or $100 if they use doctors and hospitals in a Virginia Blue Cross network. Dental, hearing and eye care are included, as well as total disability insurance and company-paid health club memberships.
Part-time workers who average 30 hours a week are eligible for the basic plan, except for the dental, hearing and eye care.
Ukrops "would like to keep those benefits in place," she said. "When the Government steps into a role that has been held by private enterprise, that's always a concern," she added.
 
Microsoft Corporation

Besides the usual types of medical coverage, the Microsoft Corporation, the computer software company based in Redmond, Wash., pays for some experimental cancer and AIDS treatments, which would not be included in the Clinton plan.
Microsoft's 10,000 predominantly young employees -- the average age is 32 -- are also allowed to select naturopathic treatment, which rejects the use of medicine.
A company spokeswoman said that Microsoft nurtures a culture that tries to "stay fresh. We have a very diverse employee base and we want to stay ahead of the curve," she said.
Most of the employees are in the Redmond-Bellevue, Washington area, Steve Winter, the company's senior benefits manager, said, but about 3,000 are scattered in 35 states. As a result, he is concerned that the company may have to deal with more than 30 local health alliances and 35 sets of state laws.
Mr. Winter said Microsoft was preparing for new Federal constraints by offering a new "flex benefits plan." Employees will be offered pre-tax credits, which can be "spent" for a choice of health plans, including traditional fee-for-service coverage, a doctor and hospital network, or an H.M.O., the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound. They can also use the credits to buy life insurance or disability coverage.
The company plans to keep the flexible benefits approach, he said, "even if we have to take it to an after-tax basis." The Clinton proposals would remove the tax break for health benefits in flex plans. In the long run, he added, Microsoft expects the flexible plan will reduce its per-employee costs, which are already "a little" lower than the $4,200 per family that the Clinton people are discussing.
"Our numbers are skewed because of our young population," Mr. Winter said. "Over time, as we get older, the costs will rise."

Want to Survive? Learn to Negotiate!

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
SO, Bunky, you're depressed because the economy's dragging, your company's melting away, you've got a hefty mortgage, a Volvo with a bad case of the Swedish flu and a gaggle of orthodontia-bait kids?
Meet Nicole Schapiro, who lived through World War II and somehow survived a firing squad during the Hungarian Revolution before coming to the United States and settling, eventually, in the San Francisco Bay Area. Ms. Schapiro, a consultant and trainer with her own firm, was in Bali in 1991 teaching women to be entrepreneurs when word reached her that she had lost her house and all her belongings in the fire that ravaged the Oakland hills. 
 Ms. Schapiro sometimes talks about her own experiences to give comfort to clients, many of whom are people in corporations coping with the reverberations of downsizing or re-engineering. Her specialty is negotiating -- but not the formal, ritualized sort that occurs between lawyers, labor mediators or captives of the Uruguay Round.
Negotiating, Ms. Schapiro theorizes in person and in her new book, "Negotiating for Your Life," is an existential philosophy, a Zen state, the motive force of human relationships, not just a means to an end. "It is the lifeblood of success," she said in a recent interview. "It is building bridges and breaking down walls." It is also the stuff of normal interaction. "The day starts with negotiating, when you and your partner decide what you are doing that day," she said. "Everything is negotiating."
What does this mean to someone perched insecurely in a job that may wisp away in the next ill wind? Ms. Schapiro's prime directive? "Shift happens," she said. "Anticipate it. Try to be part of a shift rather than falling away from it."
In bad times people often retreat into a please-God-let-me-just-make-it-through-this-crisis attitude, which is really no more than paralysis. Bad times can create opportunities as well as pain, a sentiment that may sound a little too haiku for anyone living east of the Sierra Nevadas. On the other hand, when "shift happens," optimism is cheaper than Prozac and you get roughly the same result: a good mood and control. "When there is a downsizing or 'melting down' of rules," Ms. Schapiro said, "if you have good ideas, you will get attention."
Ms. Schapiro coaches her clients not to remain passive in the face of change. She suggests, however, four steps to take before initiating any kind of negotiation:
* Audit your talent. What skills -- technical? interpersonal? -- do you have that would be of high value to your organization?
* Keep a list of what you can control and what you can't, personally and professionally. If there is something you can change that would benefit you and the company, make a plan to do it.
* Assess your networks. Keep track of the people you know and the information they may have about the company.
* Keep yourself focused on what you want and understand what distracts you from your focus. Don't, for example, get obsessed with meager budgets; instead, figure out a way around the low budgets.
Finding a way around obstacles features heavily in Ms. Schapiro's counsel. She urges clients to begin with basics.
"If you know your company is going to downsize 5,000 people, then you know it's not rational or objective," she said. "Be visible. Help them. Try to find out if there are criteria, like last hired, first fired. If there are no criteria, start with that, don't personalize it. Perhaps find someone who knows your work to speak for you."
RAISE your visibility by volunteering for projects important to the company's new direction. Or by learning new skills that will be needed. Or by offering to give up or share something you have -- a large, private office, for example -- for something your department needs, like more space.
One of Ms. Schapiro's female clients at a large, famously downsizing corporation offered to travel more and for longer periods, satisfying the company's need for traveling executives and its desire to have more women on the road. The quid pro quo? Some travel perks important to the employee -- and a second look from bosses who had been ready to put her on the redundant list.
In Ms. Schapiro's experience, women have more trouble with the idea of negotiating than men do. They may not view the daily negotiations of life -- getting children dressed in the morning, for example -- as negotiating. "They say, 'Negotiate! I can't negotiate,' " she said. So they back off, keeping their heads down, working harder, hoping someone will notice their contribution. They often regard what Ms. Schapiro calls positioning as manipulation. "In general" -- and she emphasizes she is speaking generally -- "women get socialized to be frightened or be nicer in competition," she said.
To anyone, male or female, Ms. Schapiro commends the lessons of her favorite games. From tennis: "I don't focus on competing against the other person, I focus on shots, where to put my feet, following through, where I'm hitting the ball," she said. Similarly, at work, depersonalize competition and forget about crushing a competitor. "Get the best visibility, get on the best teams," she said. And from chess? Cinchy: "Think four steps ahead and don't get frozen in your plan."
 
 
 
PRACTICAL TIPS TO HELP YOU THRIVE
 MORE guidance to the art of negotiating from Nicole Schapiro:
* Match your negotiating style to the style of the person with whom you negotiate. "Datacrats" want exact numbers, usually on paper. "Steamrollers" won't sit still for long presentations. Know in advance whom you are dealing with.
* In a new job, no matter how bad the economy is, try not to accept the low part of the salary range. You will never catch up. Women especially have to pull up their socks on this issue. "When the range is $36,000 to $47,000, women ask for $38,000 and men ask for $49,000," Ms. Schapiro said. Always leave room to come down.
* But in a downsizing environment, don't focus on salary alone, unless you can't pay your rent. Work on bonuses, perks or a better job title, which may create future options.
* Be patient. It takes longer to get jobs these days.
* If you can't get what you desire, be prepared to change your desires.

Nikkei Gets a Face Lift -- and Futures

BYLINE: By James Sterngold

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
WHEN the Japanese stock market began its long free fall in 1990, regulators thought they knew what the problem was: Those new-fangled stock index futures, and the American brokers who used computers to trade them.
So the regulators sought to dampen the market in Nikkei 225 futures by making them more expensive -- jacking up the margins, or the downpayment investors must make on their purchases. 
 But the market just kept falling.
Margins were raised further, the manner of settlement was changed and brokers were forced to disclose all of their futures trading, the equivalent of a poker player being forced to show his hand.
The so-called cash market, where plain stocks are traded, still kept falling.
Finally, the Finance Ministry decided that the stock index futures, which give investors the ability to bet on the overall direction of the market rather than on a single stock, needed an overhaul. After a long study, new rules for trading futures on the Nikkei index were formulated, and a new index was born -- the Nikkei 300.
Although the changes may seem highly technical, they represent some big shifts. They may also move the Finance Ministry from an attitude of hostility toward the futures market, dominated by American and European traders and their computers, to one at least of benign acceptance.
First, the new index contains 300 stocks, 75 more than the old one. A total of 155 shares from the old index will be carried over into the new one.
More important, it is calculated differently. It is a weighted index, meaning that the influence of each stock on the index is a product of the total value of the company's stock relative to the market. The old 225-stock index is a simple average, in which some smaller, relatively inactive stocks can have as much influence over index fluctuations as larger stocks.
The new futures contracts are expected to begin trading on the Osaka Stock Exchange early next year. At least initially, the old and new index futures will trade side by side. Eventually, the old futures may be phased out. Generally, experts in derivatives -- as futures and options contracts are known -- are pleased simply to have some certainty.
"We don't like question marks," said Rick Gould, a managing director in the equity derivatives department here of Morgan Stanley & Company in Tokyo. "The worry was we just wouldn't know what was going to happen."
The ministry has been explaining, brokers said, that the new Nikkei 300 futures will have four key features:
* The value of each new futures contract will be roughly half the value of the old one. That will put them more within the reach of individual investors. However, it also means large institutional investors, who deal in huge volumes, will have to buy or sell twice the number of contracts for an equivalent sized transaction. That will make the new futures slightly more cumbersome, traders said.
* Margins on the futures will come down to roughly half of where they are now over a two-year period. Currently, customers must make a down payment equal to 30 percent of the face value of the futures contracts they buy. A little over three years ago, the margin had been 9 percent, a figure that was more in line with international standards.
* On some occasions in the past, the authorities here have fought foreign exchanges listing futures contracts based on the Nikkei index, fearful that that put the trading out of the Finance Ministry's reach. But ministry officials have said they will not stand in the way of such trading on the new index.
* Rather than attempting to throttle futures trading whenever the market grows choppy, ministry officials say they will do more to actively promote the use of stock index futures as a way of drawing in more investors and giving them greater choice.
"Our view is it is still too early to judge whether this will be more acceptable to the market," said Ang Suee Tian, president of the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, which has an actively traded Nikkei 225 futures contract. "But if the market prefers it, we'll have to consider taking steps to respond to that."
The indexes are formulated by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business newspaper. (Nikkei is just a contraction of the paper's name.) The 225-stock index, introduced shortly after World War II, contains the stocks of many old-line industrial companies whose role in the economy have declined dramatically.
The new index reflects the new Japan. Companies like Japan Wool Textile and Sumitomo Coal Mining have been dropped, while Seven-Eleven Japan, the convenience store chain, and Nintendo, the electronic game maker, were added.
Clearly, the Finance Ministry hopes the new index will reduce volatility. But the first reaction to the release of the new list several weeks ago was a jolt of selling. Investors dumped some of the stocks left off the new list, while snapping up the newcomers. The Nikkei 225 tumbled 241.33 points to 20,137.31 on the first day after the announcement.
Still, traders were sanguine. In fact, few really accepted the idea that the index futures were behind the market's plunge, and so they do not expect the new index to change things much, except to calm the fidgety Finance Ministry.

HEADLINE: Mighty Brazil Rides A Free-Market Wave

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SAO PAULO

 BODY:
WHEN Paul Duval travels to the United States and Europe, all he hears are jokes about Brazil's 2,000 percent annual inflation and Brazil's "minister-of-the-month," the revolving door in the top levels of government.
That's fine for this American shopping center developer. Why invite competition when you are making money like never before? "Business is absolutely booming," said Mr. Duval, a managing partner in Shopinvest, based in Rio de Janeiro. "We are building three shopping centers, in Rio, Sao Paulo and Brasilia, for a total of $180 million." 
 Prices jumping by 37 percent a month don't faze another American, Peter Rodenbeck, a longtime Rio resident who administers about half of Brazil's 121 McDonald's.
"We are going to increase the number of our restaurants by 20 percent over the next 18 months," Mr. Rodenbeck said. "In the last year, there has been a veritable invasion of Brazil by American brand names -- Pizza Hut, Arby's, Kentucky Fried Chicken."
Indeed, American investors are increasingly taking a second look at Brazil, a nation with an economy slightly larger than Russia's and almost twice the size of Mexico's. With the bloom off of Eastern Europe as an investment opportunity, Brazil is emerging as the last major Latin American country heading toward a free market revival. The major threats continue to be a weak Government and high inflation.
Heavy American investment has helped fuel a stock market boom here. Rising faster than any other Latin American market this year, Sao Paulo's exchange has doubled in dollar value since January.
"Brazil is perceived to be the last to boom," Alden Brewster, a New York investor in emerging markets, said on a recent visit here. "Peru has boomed. Argentina has boomed. At worst, people think that Brazil will muddle through."
In the highest economic growth since 1986, Brazil's $450 billion economy is expected to expand by 5 percent this year. Referring to the size of Chile's economy, Sao Paulo's business press boasts that Brazil this year is "growing a Chile." But the growth is actually a recovery from several recessionary years.
Fueled by lower interest rates and pent up demand, residential construction has doubled in Sao Paulo, television sales have jumped nationwide by 30 percent to 3 million, and car makers believe they will build 1.3 million vehicles, another Brazilian record.
Import tariffs are now at less than half their 1990 levels, forcing manufacturers to tighten productivity to meet international competition. Since 1990, consumers have seen dollar prices drop in half for Brazilian-made stoves, bicycles, dishwashers, computers and video cassette recorders.
Since 1990, Sharp do Brasil, a subsidiary of the Japanese multinational, has cut by two thirds the time spent producing televisions and videocassettes in Brazil. Today, Sharp assembly lines produce a television in 25 minutes and a videocassette recorder in 41 minutes -- times equal to or better than the company's Japanese plants.
Some Brazilian economists complain of "jobless growth," but increased productivity means that exports surge alongside imports. During the first nine months of 1993, Brazil's foreign trade hit $48 billion, an 18 percent jump over the same period last year. Despite higher imports, Brazil's trade surplus is expected to be $15 billion -- 50 percent over the average level of the 1980's.
Following the rule that your neighbor knows you best, Argentine manufacturers are terrified that Sao Paulo will flood their markets once the Southern Cone Common Market implements zero tariffs between Argentina and Brazil at the end of next year.
"Argentina has grown in the last 14 months to become our third-largest export market, after the United States and Europe," said Lucas G. Godinez, president of Cummins do Brasil S.A., a major manufacturer of diesel engines here. "Our Argentine competitors are hanging on by their oxygen masks."
But the new self-confidence of Brazil's private sector could be betrayed by gross mismanagement in the public sector.
In a litany that sounds like a chamber of commerce Christmas carol, Brazil has had, since 1990, five central bank presidents, six treasury ministers and seven agriculture ministers. With the current President, Itamar Franco, a lame duck, the situation is not expected to improve. (A new president will be inaugurated Jan. 1, 1995.)
This month, Brazilian congressmen looked the nation's $25 billion budget deficit projected for 1994 squarely in the eye. Then they announced they would not cut spending and raise taxes in an election year. By December, inflation per month could easily be double the 19 percent yearly average for the rest of Latin America.
"Manageable levels of inflation are a requirement," said Sebastian Edwards, the World Bank's chief economist for Latin America. "Otherwise, this year's growth will be a blip. It will not be sustainable."
NEVERTHELESS, Brazil's ship of state seems to be slowly steaming down a new, free market course. A privatization program is methodically picking away at the edges of the mammoth state sector. Ending half a century of involvement in steel making, the Government this year sold all its steel companies to private investors. In the last two years, 24 of Brazil's 135 federally-owned companies have been sold, and 65 more are on the block. A final group of 45 state companies cannot be privatized without amending Brazil's Constitution.
"By the end of 1994, you are going to see the Brazilian state involved in a lot fewer activities," said Andre Franco Montoro Filho, president of the Government's Brazilian Privatization Program.
Faced with electricity blackouts looming in the late 1990's, the Government plans to auction off two regional electric companies and 19 unfinished hydroelectric dams. With the Ministry of Transport rating one third of Brazil's railway and Federal highway network as "bad" or "terrible," plans are being drawn up to lease railroads and to allow private construction companies to repair highways in return for collecting tolls.
Although $6.5 billion worth of sales make Brazil's privatization program the largest state selloff underway in Latin America, some critics say it is puny compared with the size of Brazil's state-owned industries.
"Russia in one year moved one quarter of the public sector into private hands, Mexico in four years has done well over 1,000 privatizations," said Rudiger Dornbusch, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Brazil's program is timid. It isn't major. It isn't impressive."
But the program is an achievement in a nation where the President views privatization as a necessary evil. And in November, Congress is to start a constitutional review, with business lobbying for it to open oil, mining and telecommunications to foreign investors.
Already, Petrobras, the state oil company, and Embratel, the state telephone company, are blanketing the nation with glossy magazine inserts designed to remind readers of their vital importance.
Petrobras neglects to note that, aside from Chile, Brazil is the only major Latin American nation that imports oil -- more than $100 billion worth over the last two decades, making oil the nation's largest single import. Similarly, the state telephone company neglects to note that in the last five years, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Venezuela have privatized their national telephone companies.
THE price of protectionism is clear to Guillermo Acosta, managing director the A.T.&T. Corporation's Southern Cone division. "A.T.& T. started operations in Mexico and Brazil in the same month in 1987," he recalled. "Today in Mexico, we have close to 6,000 employees, nine factories and $1 billion in annual revenues. In Brazil, we have 155 employees and annual revenues of $100 million."
Brazil's President, arguing that state oil and telephone companies are strategic assets, has vowed not to ask Congress to allow foreign investment in these areas. Although unions are lobbying hard against privatization, business lobbyists believe that time is on their side. A recent survey of 436 Brazilian congressional representatives found that 68 percent favored allowing private companies to expand their activity in Brazil's telecommunications field.
"Either you open up, or you remain behind," Oscar Dias Correa Jr., a lobbyist for private telephone companies. "There is an increasing awareness that Brazil can't stay behind."
Meanwhile, Brazilian businessmen increasingly say they have learned to work around the chronic disarray reining in Brasilia. "The country depends a lot less on the state, the government or whatever you want to call that semi-bust organization based in Brasilia," Exame, Brazil's leading business magazine, wrote this month. "Brazil today can function despite the screwups, sometimes criminal, perpetrated in Brasilia."
Luiz Luciano Costa, a vice president for Cargill Agricola S.A., said his company (annual sales: $1 billion) is continuing with long-term investment plans despite the drumbeat of disorganization emanating from the capital. "Like all Brazilian companies," he said, "we are putting Brasilia aside and are going ahead with our lives."

HEADLINE: Term Limits Drive the Talented Out of Politics

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As chairman of the Committee on Elections and Reapportionment of the California State Senate since 1987, I have been directly involved in the state and national term-limit debate since its most recent incarnation as a popular political cure-all. In California, term limits for state officeholders were enacted in 1990; term limits for members of Congress were similarly enacted in 1992. 
 In "Term Limits Limit Voters' Rights" (editorial, Oct. 21), you point out many of the drawbacks California is facing as a result of term limits -- most notably the decline of invaluable legislative expertise and institutional memory, coupled with an increase in the power and influence of bureaucrats and lobbyists.
What voters may not realize, however, is the speed at which this brain drain will occur. As the California experience has proved, many of the best and brightest of New York's elected officials will not wait until term limits force them from office. They will resign midterm, as soon as they are offered other, usually private, positions in organizations that reward, rather than punish experience and dedication.
Early, midterm departures by several legislators have had a chaotic effect on state government and have resulted in multiple special elections to fill the vacancies. These special elections have already cost our state and counties millions of dollars at a time when California is suffering through its worst recession and budget crisis since the Depression.
If those who have been leaving public service were the untalented or the corrupt, then perhaps this enormous cost would be worth it, and the term limit proponents would be vindicated. But the untalented and the corrupt don't get attractive outside offers -- the innovative and the energetic do. Encouraging the kind of people that should be running for public office to do so is difficult enough; term limits will make it almost impossible.
As a result, the people of California and New York will be the ultimate losers.

HEADLINE: LIGHTS! CAMERA!;
Clinton at Work: Is Motion the Same Thing as Action?

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"REMEMBER," said the silver-haired Democratic elder, one of the members of the capital's permanent establishment that watches them come and watches them go, "remember that Clinton is trying to do a lot, and that what he's trying to do is very difficult, and that he starts from a position of weakness."
Except from the true believers, that is the best one hears about Bill Clinton in political Washington these days. Cut him some slack, people say. 
 And it is true enough: this is a President, elected by a minority, with only a narrow margin in the Senate, with no room for fiscal maneuvering at a time of paralyzing budget constraint, who is nonetheless trying to invent a foreign policy to deal with a not-so-brave new world, to enact a comprehensive health care plan (a prize that has eluded every president from Franklin Roosevelt on), to push through a potentially revolutionary trade agreement with Mexico and at the same time to nurse the economy back into robust good health.
But the prevailing impression is that of a President blown this way and that by a never-ceasing series of tempests -- homosexuals in the military, trouble in the travel office, Bosnia, the Waco debacle, Somalia, a failed job-stimulus proposal, a budget barely enacted, Haiti, a health-care plan delayed.
Mr. Clinton gets less credit than he deserves for his accomplishments, such as his deft handling of the crises in the former Soviet Union and the enactment of a popular family leave bill, because something else always goes wrong.
As a result, this has become an Administration of relaunches. Like a manufacturer whose product stays stubbornly on the shelves, the President is constantly changing the wrapper and the advertising, then gathering his advisers around him to make a fresh start. Another, and yet another.
So it was with the appointment of David R. Gergen, and the quartet of foreign-policy speeches late this summer, and a half-dozen other fresh initiatives.
So it was last week with the health-care legislation, which seemed to have so much momentum after Mr. Clinton's vivid speech on Capitol Hill a month ago, then faltered as its details were massaged in an effort to meet early criticism.
 
Starting Over
 By the time the President stood in the Capitol on Wednesday to press the cause of reform once again, with a fervent declaration that the nation was "choking on a health-care system that is not working," it was as if he were starting from scratch again. (Outline of the plan, page 3.) There was also a distinct if subtle change in the mood of the place. In September, there had been widespread praise, with calls from some quarters for modifications or fine-tuning; this time, there was widespread agreement that the final plan would be a good deal more modest than the one proposed by Mr. Clinton, and praise only for the general idea.
To some degree, the change in atmosphere resulted from the greater detail (and hence the clearer target) of the President's new proposal, but he also paid a price for delay. Counter-proposals have been worked up by Republicans and conservative Democrats, negative ads on television have eroded public support for the Administration's plans and the credibility of Mr. Clinton himself has been worn down by the controversies that have washed over him.
The Clinton Administration, the critics say from time to time, is becalmed. But that suggests a lack of motion or energy, and this is an Administration that never stops, led by a hyperthyroid President whose advisers concluded last week that one of his problems is that he's wearing out his welcome on television. Nothing is calm in the Presidential precinct these days; all is noise, dust, confusion and seemingly disjointed activity.
"God knows he's trying," said a Democratic Congressman who first came to Capitol Hill during the Eisenhower years. "I think he may be trying too hard. I'm reluctantly coming to the conclusion that he has the dreaded Carter disease -- no focus, no continuity, confusing motion with accomplishment."
In such an environment, accomplishments get scant attention, and little was paid last week to the suddenly improved prospects for the Brady bill, the long-debated restrictions on handguns. Likewise, two of Mr. Clinton's most applauded nominations, Janet Reno for Attorney General and Ruth Bader Ginsburg for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, lost some political sheen because they came at the end of messy selection procedures.
One of the enduring questions amid these alarums and excursions, is whether Mr. Clinton has specific policy goals in which he is willing to invest his political capital.
The theme of the presentations on health care that he and Hillary Rodham Clinton made last week was that neither had any "pride of authorship" in the bill they were presenting. It is full of inconsistencies, ambiguities and compromises, with more surely to come. To some, those and the Clintons' appeals to bipartisanship reflect a canny awareness of the limits on Presidential leadership in this era of ever-weaker parties and ever-stronger pressure groups. To others, they represent a certain lack of steel.
 
Early Retreat
 On the budget, Mr. Clinton often seemed to retreat from a prepared defensive line -- the gasoline tax, for example -- even before the enemy attack reached him.
But the appearance of inconstancy has been most vivid in foreign policy. Last week, the subject was Haiti. Having signed an agreement under which President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was to be returned from exile by Saturday, and having been defied, the Administration had to watch, at least momentarily helpless, as the deadline slipped by with Father Aristide still in Washington.
Haiti, it can be argued, is small potatoes compared with Russia or China or even Bosnia. Critics argue that the United States should either send in the Marines or abandon the present plans for the restoration of democracy. But Mr. Clinton and his people respond, with some credibility, that tougher sanctions, rigorously enforced, stand at least as good a chance of eventual success.
In the end it may not be the policy that matters as much as the means of reaching it, the skill in articulating it and the steadiness in following it. On that score, the Administration is doing poorly. The rest of the world has been watching these last few months, and what it sees worries it.
"When you had an idea about what you wanted to do in Bosnia," said an ambassador from a western European country, "you sent Warren Christopher to us to say, not 'This is what we want, join us,' but 'Here is an idea, but if you don't like it, that's okay, too.' That was Clinton's fault, not Christopher's. We don't see isolationism in this, or in the inconsistencies in Somalia and Haiti, but I do see a President who is reluctant to reach out and shape the issues, in the way that only the United States can do it in today's world."
In the tartest comment to date from a senior Republican, Dick Cheney, a former defense secretary and a potential Presidential candidate in 1996, said on public television the other night: "If you're in North Korea today and you're told by the President of the United States that developing a nuclear weapon is unacceptable, and then you watch the performance in Haiti, you have to wonder whether or not you have to pay any attention to what he says."
This has domestic political consequences, too. A majority of voters may be happy that no Americans are in Bosnia, fewer are under fire in Somalia and none have landed in Haiti. They may be paying more attention to the economy's steady recovery and to the health care debate than to foreign policy questions; they usually do. But if the voters come to the conclusion that the man in the White House is unreliable, that he will make the wrong moves when the nation is backed into a corner, he will forfeit their confidence. Even before jobs, Americans want national security, and a President who dithers, even more than a President who blunders, will be made to pay. Ask Jimmy Carter.

HEADLINE: Conversations/Paul A. Samuelson;
The Man Who Wrote the Book Suggests Econ 101 for Presidents

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ASK Paul A. Samuelson how he came to win a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, and he begins by talking about his teen-age years during the Great Depression, not far from the steel mills of Gary, Ind.
"One out of three Americans couldn't find a full-time job," said Mr. Samuelson, now a professor emeritus at M.I.T. "There was no money for relief. It was a poverty amidst plenty. If you lived in a middle-class neighborhood, little children came nightly with a note saying, 'We're starving, we're starving. Could you give us a potato or a dime?' " 
 He talked about failed banks, a brother whose savings were wiped out, and soon he was extolling his intellectual hero, John Maynard Keynes, the British economist whose revolutionary rev-up-the-economy theories helped pull the world out of depression. Then Mr. Samuelson described how, as a Harvard graduate student in the late 1930's, he wrote a dissertation full of economic equations that helped explain and buttress the Keynesian system. This work was instrumental in his winning the economics prize in 1970.
Although he is 78 years old, there is more than a touch of youthful optimism in Mr. Samuelson -- indeed, he is youthful enough to play tennis every day. As one would expect from someone who has written the world's most famous economics textbook, which has been translated into more than 20 languages, he is convinced that wise economics can make this world a better place.
And he isn't shy about giving advice. His speech resembles the plain talk of President Truman -- unless he is conversing in the intellectual stratosphere with other economists. His dress is as tweedy as the Hollywood image of a Cambridge professor, and he has a power of recall that has made decades of students marvel. He quotes Adam Smith, Voltaire and Cato the Elder as effortlessly as Jimmy Connors serves.
Mr. Samuelson has an intellectually straightforward prescription for easing America's economic ills: save more and invest more. If the United States only put more of its income into savings, he explained, it would have more money to invest in education, factories and new technologies, and this would make the nation's economy grow faster and richer.
But getting Americans to save more is easier said than done, he acknowledged. If Mr. Samuelson, who is as gentle as he is gentlemanly, gets angry about anything, it is the budgetary profligacy of the 1980's, a profligacy that favored consumption over saving. Although he describes himself as a "mainstream economist," not embarrassed about always saying on the one hand, this, and on the other hand, that, he sounds as unforgiving as any leftist radical in attacking President Reagan.
"American society was economically ill-run in the 1980's," he said, chopping his right hand through the air. "Our society has been on a consumption binge. If the American people had a town meeting and said, 'What do we care about posterity? Posterity hasn't done anything for us, we're going to whoop it up now,' that is a rational judgment.' But nobody ever did that. We just backed in by the back door."
"People have the wrong idea that God will forgive Reagan. They say he didn't know what he was doing. It's true he didn't know a lot of what was going on, but he was directly responsible."
In Mr. Samuelson's view, the American people were bamboozled by a President who persuaded them that tax cuts would lead to higher revenues without producing a Himalaya of debt. The deficits that are Mr. Reagan's legacy, he said, are eating away at the nation because they mean overconsumption and underinvestment, and ultimately less growth.
Speaking with the candor that is allowed tenured professors, but not politicians, he has a recommendation for cutting the deficit that Americans don't want to hear: higher taxes. "America is not remotely near the limits of taxation, and one more pfennig is not going to break the camel's back," he said.
Mr. Samuelson loves to talk politics, although, not surprisingly, he finds it inseparable from economics. Over the years, Mr. Samuelson has advised, usually informally, Presidents, senators and Federal agencies. During the 1960 presidential campaign, he was John F. Kennedy's chief economic adviser, although he did not have a formal position in the Kennedy Administration.
"People had J.F.K. all wrong," he said. "They thought of him as a dashing, deciding type. He was an extremely hesitant person who checked the ice in front of him all the time. He said it was vanity to use your political capital on lost causes."
Mr. Samuelson has an interesting take on last year's Presidential election, almost describing President Bush as a hapless victim of economic developments, including the Federal Reserve's failure to lower interest rates nearly as fast as Mr. Samuelson said was desirable.
"The Fed caused George Bush's defeat, in my interpretation of history. It did it by acting too little and too late, always behind the wave," he said, adding that other, more powerful forces were also at work.
"The deeper cause was good jobs are being lost in America, good jobs on Main Street, at I.B.M., Digital, Procter & Gamble." he said. "George Bush had one speech like Cato the Elder in Rome -- 'Carthage must be destroyed,' Bush always said, 'We must cut the capital gains tax, and that will turn around the economy.' The American public didn't buy it." (Mr. Samuelson supports a cut in capital gains taxes but doesn't see it as a panacea.)
Mr. Clinton could also become a victim of inexorable economic forces, Mr. Samuelson, a Democrat, fears. "There is a signficant chance that we're talking about a one-term President," he said. "We're in an age of anxiety and disillusionment. I honor him for his initiatives, but they may be too much for the political process to handle."
When he talks, Mr. Samuelson sometimes seems disappointed that the world's leaders did not learn enough from his textbook. That tome, which sells for about $50, was first published in 1948 and has sold more than 4 million copies, making its author a millionaire many times over. "I never dreamed that it would have such lasting power," he said. "But it became a chain around my neck -- it constantly demanded updating." It is now in its 14th edition.
In Mr. Samuelson's free time, he often scribbles down equations on scraps of paper, like Picasso doodling. When he was in Washington one recent day for a meeting at the National Academy of Sciences, his scrap filled up with econometric symbols.
As should be expected, Mr. Samuelson had an opinion on the most burning economic issue of the day, the North American Free Trade Agreement. He supports it, saying it will increase average incomes in the United States and Mexico. He admits that some jobs will be lost because of the accord, and understands that many Americans oppose it out of anxiety about their jobs.
"We've done a pretty good job creating jobs, better than in Europe, but they tend to be low-paying jobs," he said. "The vice president of a firm on Route 128 outside Boston gets laid off, and ends up with a job as a manager at Kentucky Fried Chicken. You can't be contemptuous of that if that's all there is. The best job is better than unemployment. We can't all be pitchers for the New York Yankees."

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Small Cities Lead an Economic Charge;
The South Renews Its Sense of Self

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C.

 BODY:
"IN the feeling of the South," W. J. Cash wrote a half century ago in his quirky classic "The Mind of the South," "Progress stood quite accurately for a sort of new charge at Gettysburg."
After decades of tectonic shifts in the balance of regional power in this country, the South's view of growth still seems to echo the notion that economic progress would give the Civil War's losers the last word. Now it is worth asking whether a modern version of Pickett's charge at Gettysburg, which doomed the Confederacy, is succeeding at last. 
 Last week, in what is becoming a familiar Southern ritual, this Piedmont commercial and banking center went happily berserk after beating out four competitors including St. Louis and Baltimore for the 29th National Football League franchise and the perceived imprimatur of big-time status that comes with it. The scene echoed similar celebrations, from Atlanta bringing home the 1996 Summer Olympics, to Greer, S.C., and Vance, Ala., being selected as sites for BMW and Mercedes plants in the most lucrative manufacturing site selections of the decade.
While Los Angeles is seen battling fires driven by the Santa Ana winds and New York is thrashing through a racially charged mayoral election, the image of the South is slowly being redefined, like a photograph in the process of being developed. Whether the picture will get it right or become a rosy new stereotype as simplistic as the one of the Old South remains to be seen.
It is probably no accident that Charlotte is the home of something called the Museum of the New South. More obsessed with growth than race, more rooted in quarterly reports than Faulkner or Welty, this relentlessly upbeat home to platoons of earnest young bankers out of the University of South Carolina and Wake Forest embodies the lament diehard Southerners often voice about Atlanta: a quarter-million Confederate soldiers died for this?
But if this city of 400,000 is not much like the mythic South, it is the newest version of the New South. Like the mainstream popularity of the suburbanized country music of Garth Brooks or Vince Gill, the appeal of places like Charlotte still hasn't registered with tastemakers on the two coasts. But the city's relaxed style, low living costs and relative distance from the "Bladerunner" image of urban America is increasingly what Americans seem to be searching for. A decade ago, the idea of Charlotte -- a city of just over 200,000 people in 1970 -- having an N.F.L. franchise would have been about as ridiculous as little Raleigh-Durham being picked the nation's best city for business by Fortune magazine. Last week both things happened.
Neither is an isolated incident. While the Northeast and West Coast have lost more than 450,000 manufacturing jobs in the last two years, the Southeast has gained 23,000. And from Nashville to Greenville, S.C., second- and third-tier Southern cities are growing like few places in America.
 
Not the Plantation South
 But, in a region that has always been more heterogeneous in its industry and agriculture than its stereotypes, prosperity exists not across the South, but in a certain conspicuous pockets. For the most part, it is limited to a corridor of cities running west from Richmond across the Carolina Piedmont to Atlanta, over to Birmingham and north to Nashville. Also thriving are coastal resort areas like Hilton Head, S.C., and North Carolina's Outer Banks and retirement centers in the Ozarks and Smokeys like Bentonville, Ark., or Asheville, N.C.
Culturally, what is succeeding is the South that was once small farms and textile plants, not the plantation South of the Cotton Belt. It is almost entirely a metropolitan prosperity, one largely of new cities, not old ports like New Orleans or Savannah. And the areas that are flourishing are almost invariably the ones that made their peace most amicably with integration three decades ago.
"My favorite statistic is that in the first half of the 80's, 90 percent of all new jobs in the South were in Texas and Florida and a dozen metropolitan areas elsewhere," said John Shelton Reed, a University of North Carolina sociologist. "So if you're looking for poor people, the South is still a good place to find them, and you find them geographically concentrated and ethnically distinct, whether it's poor white folks in the mountains and poor black folks in the Cotton Belt." An estimated 80 percent of the black children under 6 growing up in the rural South live below the poverty level, and from eastern North Carolina to the Alabama Black Belt to the Mississippi Delta, the worst stereotypes of what the South was -- poor, badly educated and racially divided -- still stubbornly persist.
Limited or not, there is a growing sense of vindication throughout the South. Every N.F.L. franchise or corporate relocation southward takes on the tint of metaphor and each success encourages something approaching hysteria. When the Charlotte Observer reported on the N.F.L.'s decision by proclaiming, "And forevermore, this single decision will likely change the way people across the country feel about what lies between Washington and Atlanta," the impression conveyed was one in which sweaty behemoths butting heads on Sunday were the least of the excitement.
"This kind of thing is what Henry Grady was promoting in the 1880's for Atlanta," said Professor Reed, referring to the editor of the Atlanta Constitution and the civic and regional promoter who helped champion the "New South." "Beating the North on their own terms."
The difference now is that the South is often doing it. Some critics from the South and elsewhere say success comes at too high a price, whether in industrial giveaways, a low-paid workforce or lax environmental enforcement that will come back to haunt the region. And the South still faces mammoth problems, from substandard education to the growing chasm between the haves and have-nots.
But, at a time when Los Angeles, New York and major cities elsewhere are grappling with an unrest born of economic uncertainty, joblessness and crime, there is a sense throughout the South that the tide of history is coming back its way.
"Our President is a Southerner, our Vice President is a Southerner, and I think there's a feeling regionally that we have finally put the monster to bed," said Dan Morrill, a history professor at the University of North Carolina here. "After all these years, the verdict of Gettysburg has finally been neutralized."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: The Conservatives' Devastating Defeat;
Canada Joins the World in Dumping Incumbent Leaders

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
IN a sense, the Canadian elections last week constituted a revolution. With the Conservatives nearly obliterated, regional parties have been infused with sudden national power, and are threatening to dissolve the country into jealous fiefs. Only the Liberals, swept to victory by Ontario, the most populous and richest province, remain a force to hold things together.
The changes, which give the Liberals led by Jean Chretien a comfortable majority of 178 out of 295 House of Commons seats but have created hostile factions of western Reformers and Quebec separatists, took place for reasons that are both born of Canadian politics and are also international. Nine years ago the Conservatives, led by Brian Mulroney, came to power with the largest number of seats in the history of Canada. But his Government, and that of his successor Kim Campbell, could not control high joblessness, high budget deficits and debt. So a grassroots fury developed against Mr. Mulroney, and it was followed by a campaign of gaffes by Ms. Campbell. 
 The astonishing result last Monday was that their party was left with just two seats in Parliament and left to wonder whether it can ever rebuild.
At the same time, Canada is part of the global village, and it is not alone in giving the heave-ho to long-entrenched political parties. France, Italy, Japan and the United States all did the same in the last 12 months as voters did what they are supposed to do -- hold leaders responsible for bad times.
Peter C. Newman, economics columnist and a former managing editor of Maclean's, the Canadian newsweekly, put it succinctly: "Incumbents are toast."
Around the world, common problems have compounded the difficulties of leaders trying to keep the public's confidence. The sluggishness of most industrial economies has cut revenues and increased deficits and debts, threatening funding for welfare systems established in the good years. Even Canada's venerated national health insurance system has retrenched as it too comes under the fiscal guns. Global stagnation, moreover, has hit raw material prices, and this especially hurts Canada, where energy and mineral extraction still employ millions.
While external economics has worked against Canada and other countries, what has particularly aggravated voters here is the sense that politicians who have been in office too long lose touch with the people who elected them.
"There is the habit of politicians in most of these democracies to take on priestly attitudes, to believe they are demigods, to play in the sandbox of power and throw sand in the eyes of the citizens who put them there," says a Canadian broadcast executive, Keith Spicer.
Mr. Spicer detected the extent of the rage against Canadian politicians back in 1991 when he headed the Citizens Forum on Canada's Future, a Government-organized commission that assessed Canada's mood by contacting nearly one million citizens.
"Our report told politicians Canadians wanted them to listen to the people, to stop playing little parlor games in Ottawa, to do what they promised they would do and if they didn't the people said, 'We'll recall you.' "
What caused Mr. Mulroney's popularity to plummet to the lowest level for any Prime Minister this century was precisely that he didn't do what he had promised to do. He had, after all, won two elections by forging a coalition based on those promises.
To those concerned about Canada's debt, he had promised to cut the deficit. But he made too many compromises on spending, and while the deficit today is lower as a percentage of gross national product, it is still an astronomical $27 billion. Canada's national debt is so high that one-third of revenues goes to pay the interest.
Mr. Mulroney did introduce free trade with the United States, but here he over-promised on the benefits it would provide. And he did little to deal with the structural adjustments free trade imposed on the Canadian economy, especially during a time of recession when factories were shutting production lines anyway. As a result, tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs.
At the same time, many people in Quebec turned to his party during the 1984 and 1988 elections believing that he could deliver on promises of constitutional reform that would give Quebec the special status it had sought as a distinct society. He undertook national efforts in that direction, but could not get either of two proposed agreements adopted.
The succession of failures had devastating results for the Tories in both the west and Quebec. In the west, which has a long tradition of not running deficits, disillusioned Tories turned on Monday to Preston Manning's Reform party. And in Quebec, the erstwhile Tories were ripe for plucking by Lucien Bouchard's Bloc Quebecois, which wants Quebec out of the federation.
The Reform party speaks for many westerners who feel alienated from Ottawa because of their distance from the capital and sense that the power in Canada is exercised by Ontario and Quebec -- much as many Westerners in the United States feel alienated from Washington. For 24 of the last 25 years a Quebecer has been Prime Minister, a tradition now continued by Mr. Chretien, who is from Shawinigan, a town northeast of Montreal.
Mr. Manning, who represents a district in Calgary, Alberta, has developed a platform which would have a familiar ring to conservative western Americans in its demands for slashing budget deficits, and in its appeals for more direct democracy in the form of petitions to recall politicians and the use of more referendums.
Such parallels are more than a coincidence of geography. Alberta was deluged by Americans after 1896 when homesteading ended in the United States (in Alberta land was still free) and their descendants make up much of today's population.
 
A Rapid Slide
 As for the defeated Prime Minister, Ms. Campbell, who headed into the election campaign with a small lead over the Liberals, she will probably have to content herself only with the distinction of having been the first woman to become Canada's leader. When she took over, at a time when President Clinton and Hillary Clinton were still new in the White House, Ms. Campbell, youthful and sprightly, seemed a perfect choice for the times.
But the problems that had accumulated during the years of Conservative rule caught up with her, and were only compounded by the missteps of her campaign -- most notably, an "attack" ad that backfired because it ridiculed the way Mr. Chretien appears as the result of a partial facial paralysis. Now she seems headed for political oblivion.
In that, said Richard Gwyn, a columnist for the Toronto Star, she is "like some unknown pop singer, who lucks into one song that captures the public imagination, but who never gets back on the charts."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Worried Anew, Europe Asks How Best to Keep the Peace

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: BRUSSELS

 BODY:
EUROPEAN nation states have always been each other's worst enemies.
After the convulsion of World War II the Western European nations agreed to start over. The European Community and the American-led NATO alliance guaranteed that they would never fight each other again and formed a bulwark against the new external threat from the Soviet Union. But that is now gone, and where Communism used to be, history has fallen back into the old fratricidal patterns. 
 To ward off disaster, Western leaders keep repeating incantations that worked during the postwar era, but they have been ineffective in the new world that opened with the end of the cold war. Now they are beginning to grope for new ones.
This month Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher shuttled between Moscow, Central Asia, Eastern Europe and the Baltic states trying to persuade them of the usefulness of a new stopgap American proposal to fill at least part of the vacuum. This "Partnership for Peace" would try to give Eastern Europe a new basis for security by offering limited cooperation with NATO at the military-to-military level to all who want it, including Russia.
But Russia and its neighbors have far from similar views of what they need for their own security. Russia seeks, as it did in centuries past, to insure its security by asserting influence over its near neighbors to the west and south. What these neighbors need most, however, is security from Russian domination.
There is perhaps an analogy here to what NATO and the European Community did for Germany and its neighbors during the cold war, pooling their security and protecting them not only from the Soviet threat but reassuring other Europeans that Germany was under control as well.
But security requires sacrifice, and today none of the rich Western nations, including the United States, seems willing to sacrifice for security against the new threat of militant nationalism and ethnic instability east of the German-Polish border.
What Western Europe wants is basically to go on living the prosperous sheltered life it led for 40 years, in part at American expense in the form of 314,000 G.I.'s and thousands of nuclear weapons on European soil.
 
What Everyone Wants
 What the United States wants is for Europeans to take on more of the military burden of their own security within NATO and the Western European Union, the European Community's embryonic military arm, but not if it means a loss of American political and strategic leverage in the alliance.
And what everybody wants is an opportunity not to worry about security -- to cut military budgets and get on with the good life.
Eastern European nations like the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland know that as long as ethnic conflicts rage in Bosnia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, and fester in Romania, Moldova and perhaps elsewhere, there is no safety for them. They fear, too, that nostalgia for the old imperial days -- whether czarist or Stalinist hardly matters -- will tempt Russia to exert its influence over them, just as they have finally become independent.
The United States and the Western European countries support President Boris N. Yeltsin as the best hope there is for democracy and a market economy in Russia, and he probably is. But Mr. Yeltsin and the military and security forces he needs to keep himself in power have hardly been reassuring to the Eastern Europeans.
One of them, a diplomat, put it this way in Moscow recently: "There are two souls fighting in Yeltsin's breast. One is a democrat, and one is a traditional Russian autocrat. Right now, unfortunately, keeping himself in power is more important to him than democratic principles."
But as the bloody showdown with the old parliament in Moscow early this month showed, the alternative to Mr. Yeltsin is not someone nicer; it's someone far worse.
 
An Active Russian Military
 Even so, he has allowed the Russian military and security services to do considerable mischief-making in Georgia, providing modern weapons and "volunteers" to rebels against President Eduard A. Shevardnadze's Government there and, after Mr. Shevardnadze was forced to crawl on his knees to Moscow for help, to him too.
They have also helped bring back a former Communist to power in Azerbaijan, given military support to Armenia in its battle with Azerbaijan over the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, and have refused to pledge complete withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia as long as ethnic Russians there suffer discrimination.
If all this looks to Americans like traditional imperial divide-and-conquer tactics, think how it looks to the citizens of Ukraine, Belarus, and the Eastern European democracies. Insecurity explains why Ukraine has delayed getting rid of the nuclear warheads it inherited. And it is the main reason why the Czechs, Poles and Hungarians want to join NATO as full members as quickly as possible. With it would come a precious guarantee of military aid if Russia should suddenly become a menace again, or fall apart into turmoil. But guarantees to get involved in war wherever it breaks out are risky indeed, and some countries feel that something less -- reliance on the 53-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, for instance -- would be a better first step.
The Germans, for instance, know that Eastern Europeans worry not only about Russia but also about them. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Clinton also worry about making Russia, with its nuclear arsenal, feel threatened; NATO defense ministers (with France absent) agreed to adopt the Partnership for Peace proposal instead.
Mr. Yeltsin's reaction when Mr. Christopher explained it to him in Moscow was delight -- not about the Russian military being invited to play footsie with NATO military leaders, but about the fact that the Eastern Europeans wouldn't get into the alliance right away and bring the "West" almost to his doorstep.
The Russian military, for its part, showed in September that it still regards NATO more as a threat to its security than as a guarantor. After Mr. Yeltsin said in Warsaw that Russia had no objections to Poland and other countries joining NATO if they wanted, the military and the Foreign Ministry made him write to NATO leaders that extending NATO eastward could indeed be taken as a threat by Russia unless its right to an equal voice in the region's security was recognized.
The upshot was the Partnership for Peace proposal, which satisfied Western countries that didn't really know what else to come up with, but left the Eastern Europeans wanting more. "We don't want to be left in between the West and Russia again, the way we were for 40 years," one envoy in Moscow said.
 
Counting on Others
 The United States has so far resisted Mr. Yeltsin's calls for the West to recognize the Kremlin's right to play a peacekeeping role in the turbulent regions on Russia's southern edges, saying that the United Nations should do that. But so far it has left the job to the Russians.
Nor has NATO played such a role on its eastern doorstep, in Bosnia, even though the fighting there has generated instability and fear all over Eastern Europe, and has put legions of refugees on the road, creating a backlash in Germany, Denmark, and even Sweden. What good, many Europeans are beginning to ask, is an alliance that cannot deter this kind of conflict?
If NATO were simply a rich white men's club (Slavs need not apply), it would deserve to wither. And if it included the entire territory from San Francisco east to Vladivostok, it could become pointless.
All the same, a strategy to allay Europe's new security worries is needed. President Clinton and other leaders will be expected to come up with a sign that they recognize the need by the time they hold the NATO summit meeting here Jan. 10-11. Business as usual just won't work any more.

HEADLINE: Designers Turn New York Into a Fashion Big Top

BYLINE: By AMY M. SPINDLER

 BODY:
The New York fashion industry begins its week of runway shows today, but this time, along with the new clothes, there is a brand-new showcase.
For the first time, virtually the entire New York fashion establishment is presenting spring collections in big white tents in Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library, under the auspices of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. A centralized approach, a longtime objective of Seventh Avenue, is standard in the two other fashion capitals, Paris and Milan. The hope is that slick, world-class presentations will attract more international media attention and more fashion buyers, spurring exports. 
 "Fashion is the largest manufacturing industry in New York and the largest employer" with 200,000 jobs, said Fern Mallis, executive director of the council. Wallace L. Ford 2d, the city's Commisisioner of Business Services, said a recent study for the Mayor's office put the economic impact of the industry at $22 billion a year.
Ms. Mallis added: "There are the fashion magazines, advertising, cosmetics, modeling agencies, shopping bag producers, trucking, hangers, thread makers, department stores, let alone the real estate business dependent on fashion retail. I shudder to think what would happen to the New York economy without Seventh Avenue."
The shudder along Seventh Avenue right now is one more akin to anticipation. Whenever a tent goes up, expectations seem to rise, too, as if the circus were coming to town. The fashion circus has been here all along; this is just the first time anyone has offered to wrap a tent, and a $1.5 million production, around it.
That figure represents contributions by corporate sponsors and the costs of designers for mounting this round of shows and the fall collections in April. The council held down costs for designers showing in the tents by soliciting the sponsors and standardizing production expenses.
Designers paid $24,000 to rent one tent for a rehearsal and a show, $13,500 for another tent and $10,000 for the Celeste Bartos Forum in the library. The $24,000 tent is known as the Gertrude, a reference to the statue of Gertrude Stein, and the $13,500 tent is the Josephine, after the fountain named for Josephine Shaw Lowell, a philanthropist. The statue and fountain are now inside the tents. Bids were taken for services, and the council bargained down models' fees, and the costs of lighting, sound systems, mirrors, chairs and rolling racks.
 
TV Brings Sponsors
 Television coverage of the flashy runway shows have made the productions, like sporting events, high-visibility opportunities for advertising tie-ins. This week, crews from CNN, CBS, NBC, the BBC, Comedy Central, VH-1 and MTV are expected.
Evian, Cadillac, Clairol, Godiva Liqueur, Pantone fabric color swatches, Prescriptives cosmetics, The New York Times, and Elle, Harper's Bazaar, Town & Country and Vogue magazines anted up more than $100,000 each to become sponsors. They are now entitled to tickets for some shows and to have their names listed on all promotional material for the event. This money went to the Seventh on Sixth Corporation, established by the council to defray costs of the shows.
The designer Donna Karan, who with Calvin Klein put her considerable clout behind the event early on, said that there has been increasing European interest in "reality based" American design. Ms. Karan's is the first offical show, with her lower-priced DKNY collection scheduled at 1 P.M. on Sunday; the day's schedule ends with Mr. Klein's CK collection, which is in the same price category. Both designers will show their higher-priced lines ($900 suits, say, versus $500 ones) on Friday, the final day of the showings.
"There's been some discussion of whether American designers should go to Paris to have people see what we do," Ms. Karan said. "But most people want to come here to see the collections, because they can feel New York, breathe it, and get the energy of the city."
 
Attending Was an Ordeal
 In the past, feeling and breathing New York has brought complaints from the foot soldiers of fashion week. The showings were in cramped Seventh Avenue showrooms, hotel ballrooms, SoHo lofts, night clubs, design-school auditoriums and other disparate locations, turning attendance into an ordeal. While a few designers will continue to use such places this week, most of the major players will appear in Bryant Park.
"It's really time that the American designers did it," Mr. Klein said. "We're all in this together and we're all going to gain. It's a win-win situation. The industry wins, New York wins, the city wins, the state wins. And the country wins, because the world will be looking at something we do very well."
Even if shows tie up traffic in the area a bit, cabdrivers still may want to add a little statue of their favorite Seventh Avenue designer to their dashboard icons. The Department of Transportation speeded up construction on the Avenue of the Americas near Bryant Park because of the fashion shows, and all four lanes are open.
"When we realized that Seventh on Sixth approached, we went into action to find out how construction could be rearranged and rescheduled to be out of their way so they could have a glorious celebration," said Lucius J. Riccio, the city's Commissioner of Transportation. "We've been working around the clock for the last month or so to try to expedite the job, not just for Seventh on Sixth, but for everybody."
 
A Chance to Ogle?
 Bryant Park has become a pastoral destination for the lunch-bag crowd, and not everyone will be happy to have paparazzi strolling by as they eat their ham sandwiches. But the patient park-bench spectator may get a glimpse of Todd Oldham, Isaac Mizrahi or Ralph Lauren, or of models and media stars like Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz and Christy Turlington. Or the crew of the director Robert Altman, researching the much-touted film on the fashion business, "Pret-a-Porter."
There was some unrest at lunchtime this week about the appropriation of what regulars proudly call "our" park.
"They put their runway over the fountain, and that's too much," said John Vasquez, an out-of-work architect who regularly eats lunch in the park with his 15-month-old daughter Jazzman. "And the fashion show isn't even open to the public. It's a public park, and if they're going to have a fashion show it should be public. I'm sure you can get into those shows if you have the right income bracket."
A New York University professor, Allan Kent Dart, who was pausing to smoke a cigarette on a lawn chair, said, "I suppose the controversy is, why should the fashion shows be allowed here when people who don't have a home are kicked out?"
 
Expansion Plans
 For the next round of showings, in April, the council hopes to placate these outsiders by broadcasting some shows on a large television screens outside the tents.
"We made sure 80 percent of the park was open to the public," said Dan Biederman, executive director of the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, the private, nonprofit organization that runs the park. "A number of designers told us it's been such a boon in publicity that there are plans to possibly do a benefit for the public next time, making it inexpensive to see a sort of digest of the shows produced, and money going to the New York public parks."
Until the last model strolls off the runway Friday evening, New York designers will have a niggling feeling of disbelief that finally, after years of talk, they've bound the industry together.
"What I find significant is that it was the designers who were the catalysts for this," said Stan Herman, a designer who is the president of the council, made up of 185 designers. "Not the manufacturers, or the retailers or the mass merchants, or any of the people with the money. The designers have finally found a voice."

HEADLINE: Nuclear Era Is Departing By Same Door It Entered

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMARILLO, Tex., Oct. 29

 BODY:
Nuclear disarmament begins at a conference table in Moscow, Geneva or Washington. But it is carried out in places like a circular concrete cell buried in the dusty soil of the Texas Panhandle, where spheres of high explosives are pried from their cores of plutonium, rendering a bomb of almost unimaginable power into a collection of merely hazardous ingredients.
Dismantling nuclear warheads may be infinitely better than detonating them, but the job is tricky. In addition to being radioactive, plutonium is highly toxic and can burn on contact with air, and most of the explosives are old and prone to detonate with heat or shock. 
 The room is round so that if there is a nonnuclear explosion, the blast would be directed upward, where it would raise the roof, which is covered to a depth of 15 and a half feet with sand and gravel. Then the gravel would come back down and crash in, snuffing out the explosion, and incidentally, the 8 or 10 technicians in the room.
 
First Glimpse
 "It wouldn't matter to them," a plant official told a group of reporters on Thursday during a tour of two disassembly rooms at the Pantex plant 17 miles northeast of Amarillo. "They wouldn't be alive to notice."
Officials of the Department of Energy and its contractor here, Mason & Hanger-Silas Mason Company, refused to discuss a number of details about the work. But the department, perhaps anxious to show its competence in the new and critical task of dismantling 10,000 bombs and warheads in the next few years, offered people without security clearances the first glimpse of a long-classified world.
For example, in the disassembly cell, known as a "gravel gertie" for the tons of material above the workers' heads, engineers showed where they would wheel in the "physics package," or central explosives assembly, of a bomb, warhead or artillery shell. Rolled gently over a concrete floor with a nonskid coating, the assembly would be brought as close as possible to a waist-high metal table covered with a fabric cloth.
Removing the blanket of high explosives takes several hours to days, depending on the technology used when the weapon was assembled. A technician then lifts out the "pit," a sphere of plutonium about the size of a bowling ball, and puts it in a metal frame. A stainless steel jacket on the plutonium blocks some radiation. On the tour officials did not show a pit; in fact, the substitute they used was a bowling ball without holes.
Explosives attached to a core have never detonated at Pantex, although there have been various accidents at the plant over the years. Several workers were killed in the detonation of high explosives in which no plutonium was involved a few years ago, for example.
The Pantex plant, long known as the final assembly point for nuclear weapons, is perhaps better described as the disassembly point, at least for now. "We don't currently have any new production on line, but we have that responsibility," said Tom W. Walton, a spokesman.
The weapons displayed on the tour were the training versions without the plutonium core or high explosives and bearing data on weight, length and diameter, but not on the explosive power, or yield. The yields run from the equivalent of thousands of tons of TNT for artillery shells and small bombs dropped from airplanes, to the equivalent of millions of tons, for larger bombs and missiles.
With steady work and relatively good pay, the work force has low turnover, about 3 percent a year, and technicians say they get extensive training. Certainly there is something unusual about the physical settings, including revolving doors meant to contain blasts and windowless rooms where each wall is marked with a different color to help keep people properly oriented. But despite such constant reminders, the workers show little feeling about working on devices that can obliterate whole cities.
"If you get spooked, this is not the place to be," said Douglas Black, 60 years old and a 24-year veteran. His work is mostly mechanical, he said, but "it's not as greasy as working on your car."
Pantex, which stands for Panhandle of Texas, is a mixture of World War II-vintage buildings and modern, computerized systems, of cold war thinking and post-Soviet realignment. It covers 16,000 acres of the Texas plains, some of it a buffer zone defined by a few strands of barbed wire, and other parts defended by cascades of razor wire, huge infrared motion detectors and guards in desert camouflage driving armored Chevrolette Suburbans with holes cut in the roof and M-60 machine guns mounted on them.
Built early in World War II to handle conventional explosives and opened in 1951 as a nuclear weapons plant, Pantex is where plutonium was joined with the blankets of high explosives, detonators, timers, altimeters, parachutes, outer casings and other parts. Assembly is mostly nuts and bolts, but it is complicated, because a typical weapon can have 6,000 parts.
Pantex has been in the disassembly business for nearly as long as it has been in the assembly business, but mostly for servicing weapons or dismantling obsolete ones so some parts could be re-used.
Now amid its endless corridors, where technicians gently wheel bombs and warheads as if they were frail patients on hospital gurneys, Pantex is taking back about three dozen weapons a week, disassembling them, shredding some parts that are classified, sending others back to the weapons plants that made them, burning the high explosives and recovering the plutonium.
 
Russian Effort Is Uncertain
 Russian officials have given some indications that they, too, are dismantling weapons, but a report in September by the Office of Technology Assessment, a Congressional agency, said that information was "very limited, and sometimes conflicting or ambiguous."
"Although the Russians clearly possess the facilities for nuclear warhead dismantlement, it is not clear that their economy will be able to maintain the personnel, infrastructure, and financial resources required to operate these facilities," the report said.
Pantex has been storing plutonium in upright 30-gallon steel drums on the floors of 50-year-old concrete bunkers originally built for conventional explosives. But with more than 5,000 plutonium cores on hand and 10,000 more expected in the next few years, the plant will run out of space in the first three months of next year.
So with the help of the weapons-design laboratories, Pantex has devised a new system to stack barrels horizontally in the bunkers, in steel racks moved by a forklift shielded from radiation. Officials showed off a working model, minus the plutonium. It would allow storage of 672 cores in each bunker, which is a little bigger than a two-car garage; the current limit is 440. But the Energy Department is still reviewing the proposal.
One issue in dealing with plutonium is avoiding "criticality," or assembling enough material to sustain a chain reaction. Although this would produce a shower of heat and radiation, it would not produce a large blast because the plutonium would fly apart, unlike what happens in a weapon, where the high explosive contains the plutonium through several generations of chain reactions, producing a huge explosion. Pantex officials say, however, that becausethe placement of one pit per barrel surrounded by packing matter keeps the plutonium too far apart, a criticality is impossible.
Another issue is the possibility of a plane crash. Planes on instrument landings and takeoffs at Amarillo International Airport, which is nearby, fly over the plant. Ten yearsa ago the Energy Department asked the Federal Aviation Administration to order changes in flight patterns at the airport, but the agency refused. The Department of Energy believes that the probability of a crash in the area of the bunkers is slightly greater than one in a million per year, but the chance of a crash by a plane large enough to cause a release of plutonium is less than one in a million per year. The Energy Department is now considering approving the new storage plan without a change of flight pattern.
The new storage approach is described as an interim solution for plutonium, but there is no longer-term plan. The department is unwilling to accept the idea that the plutonium is now waste, too, but even if it did, it has no place for permanent disposal.
Pantex is even having trouble getting rid of the conventional explosives. For years it has burned them in the open, even though some are contaminated with radioactive material and chemical toxins. Now the neighbors are objecting.
A spokesman for the plant said Pantex had recently stopped burning explosives contaminated with radioactive material while it looked for another disposal method.
Other materials coming out of the weapons include hazards like asbestos and PCB's. And then there is gold used in electrical connections, which by some estimates is worth up to $50,000 per weapon.
But that is a pittance when contrasted with the cost of taking a weapon apart. Plant officials could not say what disassembly costs, pointing out that there are large fixed costs for security and other overhead items that are not dependent on the volume of work performed by about 300 technicians. For the fiscal year 1994 the budget runs to $210 million, plus $45 million for environmental restoration and waste management and another $40 million in capital improvements.
But the Office of Technology Assessment recently calculated that the Energy Department's total spending for dismantlement, here and at other sites to which Pantex sends components, runs from $500 million to $1 billion a year. That would put the cost per weapon at $350,000 to $700,000.

HEADLINE: 10% of Fruit Juice Sold in U.S. Is Not All Juice, Regulators Say

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
The clandestine production and sale of adulterated fruit juice is a widespread and highly profitable practice, a review of court cases filed across the country shows -- a practice that is costing American consumers an estimated $1.2 billion a year and exposing them to undisclosed and unapproved chemicals.
Regulators at the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees the food industry, had hoped that tainted juice would become less common after the Federal prosecution in 1987 of Beech-Nut Nutrition Corporation. Beech-Nut paid a $2 million fine for illegally selling "apple juice" that was nothing more than sweetened water and chemicals. But the recent cases all involved activities that continued long after that landmark case.
 
Enforcement Still Haphazard
 And while Federal officials say they are committed to pursuing adulteration cases, court exhibits and interviews with investigators and juice industry executives show that enforcement efforts are still haphazard, plagued by inadequate resources and an institutional tradition that has put a low priority on cases that, at least until recently, were not considered a threat to public safety. 
 David A. Kessler, commissioner of the F.D.A., said on Friday that his agency was determined to prosecute juice adulteration cases when it could muster evidence to support a criminal case. "And these are serious prosecutions," Dr. Kessler said. "People are going to jail."
But he conceded that despite past efforts, the juice industry remained a troubling exception to the agency's generally successful efforts to combat food adulteration. "We still have to be vigilant," he said. "In most cases of adulteration, it turns out to be just economic and nobody gets hurt -- but there is always that potential."
Chemists who specialize in testing food samples estimate that about 10 percent of the country's $12 billion pure fruit juice industry, about half of which is made up of orange juice, is adulterated in some way. The most common adulterants are sugar or watery orange byproducts, but in some recent cases, manufacturers have used preservatives not approved as safe for use in juice.
Many manufacturers cited in court cases since 1987, while not nationally known names like Beech-Nut, were important wholesalers to food producers like Borden and Land O'Lakes, and grocery chains like Kroger, Safeway Stores and Alpha-Beta markets. There have been no Federal claims that these retailers knew they were selling adulterated juice.
The recent defendants include:
*Peninsular Products of Warren, Mich., Flavor Fresh Food Corporation of Chicago, and eight individuals, who pleaded guilty after being indicted in February on Federal charges of conducting an eight-year conspiracy to add sugar and illegal preservatives to more than 32 million gallons of citrus juices sold under various private labels in 26 states. Court records show that the juice contained unapproved preservatives.
*Paramount Citrus Association of Mission Valley, Calif., a unit of the private investment partnership that also owns Teleflora Inc., the flower delivery service, and the Franklin Mint, the collectibles retailer. In April, Paramount and its plant manager pleaded guilty in Philadelphia to selling adulterated juice to the Federal Government since 1985. The defendants also paid nearly $7 million to settle civil claims by the Government.
*Seven executives of Sun Up Foods Inc. of Benton, Ky., which before its bankruptcy in September 1990 claimed to be one of the country's largest juice wholesalers. The defendants, who have denied the Government's allegations and are scheduled to go to trial in April, were accused of adding liquid sugar to their juice with equipment hidden in a secret room in their factory.
 
$2 Million in Settlements
 Meanwhile, Everfresh Juice Company, -- which from 1987 until 1992 was owned by the Canadian brewing giant John Labatt Ltd., the owner of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team -- and the American Citrus Products Corporation, doing business as Home Juice in Melrose Park, Ill., have paid more than $2 million to settle lawsuits in Chicago accusing them of using sugar and illegal preservatives in their juices for more than a decade. The cases, filed in 1990 under a secrecy order, were settled in April.
The terms of the settlement are still being contested in court, said James Emmerton, the general counsel for Labatt, "so I cannot comment." He added, "In general, we have a policy that we comply with the law and try to enforce those policies throughout all our operations."
Steven M. Kowal, the attorney for American Citrus, said the company had instituted a program of independent testing for its juice. "Beyond that, I cannot comment because of the litigation," he said.
 
Cutting Corners
 Kristen Chadwell, who until July was the general counsel for the Florida Department of Citrus, said unscrupulous manufacturers had long cut corners by diluting juice with cheap but generally harmless ingredients like beet sugar and pulp wash, the watery residue obtained by soaking squeezed oranges in water and squeezing them a second time.
But diluted, sweetened juice is more prone to spoilage, and Ms. Chadwell said the industry's search for less detectible chemical preservatives may be outstripping the regulatory efforts to protect consumers. "These are complicated, white-collar crimes," Ms. Chadwell said, "and the potential for profit is enormous. So the analytical methods involved are on the cutting edge."
That cutting edge slices past such safe but easily detectable preservatives as sorbate and sodium benzoate, which can be used legally if they are listed on the labels, to focus on less detectable preservatives such as natamycin.
 
A Secret Solution
 Indeed, executives at Peninsular Products did not know exactly what they were adding to their juice when they were using an imported German preservative whose ingredients were kept secret by the supplier, said Assistant United States Attorney Brian K. Delaney, a prosecutor of that case.
In sworn statements filed in the Chicago litigation against Everfresh, some witnesses testified that they suspected the secret solution contained diethyl pyrocarbonate, or D.E.P.C., banned as hazardous by the F.D.A. in 1972. But that speculation has not been substantiated by laboratory tests.
Efforts by the F.D.A. to find and analyze samples of the compound have been unsuccessful. But Federal investigators in the Michigan case found a 1987 formula that listed the solution's active ingredients as natamycin and two enzymes called glucose oxidase and catalase. While not as dangerous as D.E.P.C., none is approved by the F.D.A. as safe for use in beverages.
 
Consultant Pleads Guilty
 According to documents filed in Federal District Court in Grand Rapids, Mich., last week, several defendants and other witnesses in the Michigan case have told prosecutors under oath that similar imported preservatives had been purchased in the past by Home Juice and Everfresh Juice, the defendants in the Chicago civil suits.
One of the Peninsular defendants is Friedrich R. Kohlbach, a juice industry consultant accused of supplying the illegal preservatives to Peninsular and Flavor Fresh. In early September, Mr. Kohlbach pleaded guilty to a single felony violation of Federal food purity laws. In a report prepared for his sentencing, which will take place in November, Federal prosecutors said he had also sold the preservatives to other companies.
The Government lawyers described the preservative Mr. Kohlbach supplied to Peninsular and Flavor Fresh as "a milky, white liquid" that "arrived in blue, 5-gallon jerry cans" bearing the following warning in German: "Contains dangerous goods of the highest classification."
That description exactly matches the one provided in November 1988 to the F.D.A.'s Detroit office by Duane Bosch, a former quality-control employee of Everfresh in Detroit. According to the employee's sworn affidavit, which is filed in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, Mr. Bosch gave samples of the fluid to the F.D.A., which tested them months later with inconclusive results.
On Jan. 11, 1989, Mr. Bosch sued Everfresh under Michigan's whistle-blower law, claiming he was fired for questioning the use of the mysterious preservative; the case was settled out of court nine months later, according to the affidavit.
A lawyer for Labatt, in a sworn affidavit, said his firm was called on Feb. 7, 1989 by in-house lawyers for Labatt, who said they had learned that "unlabeled ingredients" had been added to the company's orange juice. After an internal investigation, Labatt executives met with F.D.A. officials in May and June of 1989.
At the June meeting, according to an F.D.A. memorandum, the Labatt representatives reported that "at some unspecified point, they realized that Everfresh's orange juice was adulterated. This realization was apparently very recent and long after their purchase of Everfresh." Apparently, the F.D.A. accepted the company's assurances that the problem had been solved.
But court records in Chicago show that before Labatt purchased Everfresh Juice in late 1986, Everfresh had been sued six times for allegedly adulterating its products. One such case, by Purity Products of Baltimore, Md., was pending at the time of the sale and was settled out of court eight months later. A similar case, also by Purity Products, was filed in early 1988 against Holiday Juice, a subsidiary of Labatt until 1992, and was settled about six months later.
While Justice Department officials clearly hope that the recent prosecutions will be the curative that the Beech-Nut case was supposed to be, officials at both the F.D.A. and the Justice Department acknowledge privately that some cases still are not being pursued aggressively enough.
Some juice industry executives and advisers blame an overworked staff at the F.D.A., which must meet its vast mandate on a budget smaller than those of many big hospitals. Dr. Kessler, the head of the agency, said his agency lacked the statutory power to issue subpoenas or demand access to industry records to trace adulterated food, hampering its enforcement efforts.
But James Mundo, an outspoken F.D.A. juice industry investigator in Saginaw, Mich., said there had been occasions when good F.D.A. cases were dropped because Federal prosecutors in some jurisdictions were unwilling to take the cases to court.
And without meaningful punishment and stiff fines, the profit motive will always encourage cheating, said Alan Brause, the chief chemist and president of Analytical Chemical Services of Columbia, Md., a laboratory frequently used in Government investigations. "The money to be made is just stupendous," he said. "Sugar costs 30 cents a pound, and real juice solids costs between $1 and $2.50 a pound," he added. "That's the temptation right there."

HEADLINE: AMERICAN AIRLINES IS FACING WALKOUT

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Tex., Oct. 30

 BODY:
The flight attendants' union broke off contract talks with American Airlines today after all-night negotiations and called for a nationwide boycott against the company.
"We are free to strike or to engage in other activities that would have an economic impact," said a union spokesman, Ray Abernathy, after a negotiating session of 25 1/2 hours with a mediator. "We have said we will strike on or before Nov. 22." 
 The contract covering the flight attendants did not expire but was opened for amendment on Dec. 31. A year of contract talks between the airline and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants came down to the exhaustive bargaining session because a 30-day "cooling-off" period set by the National Mediation Board expired at midnight Eastern time.
 
Planning Boycott
 The airline, based in Fort Worth, and the union had agreed to an indefinite extension, but talks ended about 9:30 this morning, Mr. Abernathy said.
"The nutshell is that the company was unwilling to compromise on concession demands for total control over staffing, cuts in vacation benefits, some radical changes in work rules and new employee contributions to pre-fund retiree health benefits," he said.
"We are going to begin our action immediately by launching a nationwide boycott of American Airlines to start drying up their business before we go on strike," he said.
A spokesman for the airline, Tim Smith, said: "We're just extremely disappointed, heartbroken even, that talks with the A.P.F.A. have broken off. We're studying our options.
"As of this moment, our employees are reporting, and operations continue on a normal schedule."
The union's 21,000 members had threatened to strike on or before Thanksgiving week, one of the year's busiest travel times.
Mr. Abernathy said the two sides were never close to settling.
"The company's final payoff was especially insulting," he said. "They offered us a raise of 7.5 percent over the life of the contract, along with a 4 percent signing bonus. That's not a pay raise. That's a bribe. It doesn't get added onto the scale. It's just a one-time bonus."
Mr. Smith said the airline had offered a contract with increases averaging 33 percent, or more than 7 percent a year for the average flight attendant.

HEADLINE: Glittering New Capital Belies Turmoil in Nigeria

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ABUJA, Nigeria

 BODY:
Amid a wooded plain and soaring granite hills, a new city is rising here, its splendor and vast scale in stark contrast to the pervasive rot and decline of much of Africa.
This is the site of Nigeria's new capital, a reflection of the country's sense of itself as black Africa's leader, and at the same time a symbol of a nation hoping to be one of the world's great powers in the next century. 
 Although hospitals in Nigeria are chronically short of medicine, schools are often closed because there is no money to pay teachers and many of the country's 90 million people are dirt poor, this glittering new settlement, still under construction, is being built at a reported cost of $10 billion. There has been no official public accounting of how much has been spent or exactly where the money has gone.
The original plan called for a national government modeled after the United States, with a two-chamber federal assembly, a supreme court and an elected civilian president. It was all to have been functioning smoothly by the early 1990's.
 
The Buildings Are Vacant
 But while the buildings to house those officials are finished, they either stand vacant or the officials working there are idle -- or, as in the case of the federal court officials, largely ignored and likely to remain so for the indefinite future.
The Nigerian Government has thrown a grand costume party, with drinks, food and entertainment, but the invited guests are stuck in a squabble at the front door.
Abuja illustrates what critics say is a dangerous vacuum of leadership, a growing absence of direction and common purpose that is threatening to tear the country apart.
"There is no real common denominator anymore, no real leadership at the top," said Nosa Igiebor, editor-in-chief of Tell, a weekly news magazine. "The country is sinking into a political void. We are on the verge of disintegrating."
The most apparent cause of Nigeria's latest political crisis is the decision by its former military leader, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, to annul the multiparty presidential elections held last June 12.
But there are deeper causes: decades of mediocre government, pervasive corruption, a military leadership stubbornly clinging to power and ethnic and religious rivalries that have kept this country from establishing a social consensus more than 30 years after independence from Britain in 1960.
 
Two Rival Centers of Power
 Since September two rival power centers have claimed to rule this increasingly fragmented republic: an interim Government under the command of Ernest Shonekan, which was created by General Babangida, and a democratically elected one headed by Moshood Abiola, a wealthy industrialist who is widely believed to have won the elections in June.
The real power lies with the military. Soldiers have run the country for all but nine years since independence. And the armed forces appear in no hurry to give up the power to which they have become accustomed.
Until the leadership crisis is resolved, Abuja will probably remain an empty shell, a monument to Nigeria's hugely unfulfilled ambitions.
What is being lost, moreover, is the elaborate fiction that provided Nigerians with the idea that they were somehow different from the other countries that make up Africa; that this country, rich in oil, was not only more populous and wealthier than the others, but also that Nigerians were creating a thriving oasis of capitalist democracy that others would follow and emulate.
"Nigeria's dream is to become another America, to be respected and feared as Africa's unchallenged superpower," a Western diplomat said the other day. "But the truth is that is no different from the rest of the continent. It's an unworkable mess."
Gen. Olusegun Obansajo, a former head of state, said many Nigerians "feel a sense of shame, a sense of embarrassment about what has happened to our country. This is now what we have fought so long and hard for."
The impasse is all the more alarming because Nigeria has a history of violent upheaval. At least 500,000, and perhaps as many as one million people, are said to have died, mostly through starvation, in the Biafran secessionist war in the late 1960's. And thousands of people die each year in ethnic or religious-based conflicts.
Since overthrowing the authoritarian regime of Maj. Gen. Muhammed Buhari in 1985, Nigeria's military leadership has been trying to lay the foundations for a Western-style multiparty democracy that would have guarantees against a reversion to the corrupt and dictatorial rule that has existed in much of the continent.
But under General Babangida, the "transition," as this elusive blueprint for the future is called, seems to have lost its way. Leftists and human rights advocates complain about the belt tightening and unemployment caused by General Babangida's economic policies, and a relatively small but influential faction of the 80,000-strong armed forces grumbles that he is going to far in opening Nigeria's politics.
The economy has virtually collapsed. The inflation rate has soared from 13 percent in 1991 to more than 50 percent today. Compounding the sense of crisis are periodic fuel shortages, a shock in a country whose economy is based on petroleum production. The main cause for the shortages, Government officials say, is a surge in smuggling to other countries. Others blame corrupt, incompetent Government bureaucrats who, they say, have allowed supplies of refined petroleum to fall to perilously low levels. Oil accounts for more than 95 percent of export earnings.
 
Unquestionable Potential
 The future is not entirely bleak. With one of the largest gross national products in Africa and a population that includes one in four black Africans, Nigeria unquestionably has exceptional potential. Moreover, efforts to privitize and decentralize the economy in the late 1980's, while piecemeal, did contribute to a burst of growth, and the country has a considerable number of highly educated workers.
And despite recent crackdowns, Nigeria's press remains boisterously critical of both the Government and the opposition and is intent on discussing the issues that, for now, are paralyzing the nation.
But opposition leaders and political commentators say that the prospects Nigeria will recover its political equilibrium soon are bleak.
Ray Ekpu, editor of Newswatch, a weekly magazine, wrote recently that Nigerians "seem to have an obsessive sense of something, perhaps everything, going wrong. We wish we could wake up, scrub our eyes and tell ourselves it was a dream, for a dream would be a lot easier to deal with."
"But this is reality," he added, and "we are rapidly careering into a frightening state of ungovernability."
The current crisis began after General Babangida annulled last June's elections, saying there was evidence of fraud and vote-buying. Then, over the protests of the presumed winner, Mr. Abiola, the General promised to organize yet another election in late July.
Faced with an international outcry and growing domestic protests, General Babangida, along with the mostly hand-picked leaders of the Nigeria's two legal political parties, settled upon a compromise. The idea of holding new elections immediately was scrapped, and the General agreed to leave office and appoint an interim Government that would organize new elections and hand over to an elected President early next year. But Mr. Abiola, the Social Democratic party's candidate, and Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention were effectively barred from holding office.
The interim Government has proven unpopular, and its leader, Mr. Shonekan, has been widely ridiculed as a puppet for an unseen but powerful coterie of military leaders who are now the dominant force in the country.

HEADLINE: HAITIAN MILITARY CONDEMNED BY U.N.

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct 30

 BODY:
Still hoping that a solution can be brokered in Haiti, the Security Council condemned the Haitian military today for blocking the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide but stopped short of even repeating its warnings of a tighter trade embargo.
The statement was issued by the Security Council President, Ronaldo Mota Sardenberg of Brazil, on the day originally set for the exiled President to be restored to office under an agreement signed in July. 
 Diplomats here said the United Nations mediator in Haiti, Dante Caputo, was still appealing for talks with the Haitian military in the coming week to resolve the standoff. But there was no response from the army in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital.
In its statement, the Security Council condemned the military for failing to observe its obligations under an accord it signed in New York in July calling for Father Aristide's restoration to power by Oct. 30 and for the resignation of Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the head of the Haitian armed forces.
 
Oil and Arms Banned
 The Council hinted pointedly that the military still had time to make good on its pledges, reaffirming that the agreement remains "fully in force as the only valid framework for the solution of the crisis in Haiti."
The current United Nations embargo against Haiti bans shipments of oil and arms. Content to bide its time in case a settlement can be mediated, the Council did not repeat recent warnings by diplomats that the embargo may be extended to all commercial goods.
"Let's see what comes out of these talks," Mr. Sardenberg said.
Even the measure condemning the military was held up for 24 hours by China as it sought to extract an apology of sorts from President Aristide, who infuriated Beijing by calling for Taiwan's admission to the United Nations when he addressed the General Assembly last week.
Today Father Aristide in effect capitulated to that demand. In a letter to the entire United Nations membership, his Government said that President Aristide had assured China's representative at a meeting on Friday that his country wanted good relations with China and that those ties should be governed by "relevant" United Nations resolutions. The United Nations voted in 1971 to expel Taiwan, which had previously occupied China's seat.

HEADLINE: Amid Strife, Haiti Parliament Struggles With Itself

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Senator Julio Larosiliere the most senior member of the Haitian legislature, says the return of democratic rule in the country rests in the hands of its exiled President's allies in Parliament.
Like many others in the parliamentary bloc that for two years has resisted attempts to restore the elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Mr. Larosiliere said Father Aristide's legislative supporters lacked the courage of their convictions. 
 Mr. Larosiliere said that instead of turning out last week to pass legislation that diplomats said could have paved the way for Father Aristide's return from exile, deputies in the constitutional bloc, which supports Father Aristide, stayed in hiding or exile, preventing the quorum needed for a vote.
"Therein lies the big problem," said Mr. Larosiliere. "Instead of trusting our initiative, they are creating problems."
 
Legislators Silent
 Although Mr. Larosiliere is a member of the alliance bloc of legislators, which opposes Father Aristide, he is the architect of an 11-point plan to restore him to power and end the international embargo against Haiti.
But for Patrick Norzeus, a deputy in the constitutional bloc who has continued to support Father Aristide openly, despite a spate of political killings targeting people like himself, it is Mr. Larosiliere who is not working in good faith but is instead using his seeming support for Father Aristide's return as a ruse to delay the restoration of democracy.
On Wednesday, as the lower house failed to reach a quorum for a second day, journalists covering the session from the gallery of the chamber, saw assembled outside many alliance block deputies who declined to respond when their names were called. If they had answered, it would have given the lower house the quorum it needed to enact legislation that the military insists must be passed before Father Aristide returns.
The alliance "has always found a way to block any real push to bring Aristide back," Mr. Norzeus said. "It is the game that they play."
The contradictory views in the Haitian Parliament underscore the depths of the problems in the struggling institution as it tries to acquire some level of legitimacy in the country's political life after decades of being nothing more than a rubber-stamp body.
Among members of the alliance, which has backed a role for the opposition party in the new government, the issues appear to be more about power, privilege and jobs for allies than political ideology.
At the crux of the plan to bring Father Aristide back is an amnesty for military officers involved in the September 1991 coup that drove him into exile. Under terms of an agreement signed by Father Aristide and the country's military leader, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, in New York in July, Father Aristide agreed to such an amnesty. But the military leaders want the Parliament to enact legislation guaranteeing it before they resign and allow Father Aristide back.
Facing the threat of a complete economic isolation by the international community, the Haitian lawmakers last week drafted the 11-point proposal that they hoped would be acceptable to Father Aristide and Gen. Cedras.
Mr. Larosiliere and members of his coalition are widely believed to have support among the army's high command, but he is trying to paint himself as a moderate in a sea of hard-liners, at great personal risk to himself.
"I am not isolated," Mr. Larosiliere said. "It's simply we find that the country is going down the tubes without Aristide and we want to do something about it."
Mr. Larosiliere, elected to represent Cavaillon in the Chamber of Deputies in 1984 and now one of two senators from the southern department, is a member of a landed family in the Les Cayes area. He spent three years in New York in the 1970's studying business administration and political science. When he returned to Haiti he became a coffee speculator and shortly afterwards went into politics.
He said that before taking up any measures he consulted with the military high command "to get a better understanding of the situation."
"True there are some among us who have friends in the military just like there are others" who have friends in the military, he said.
Beyond the ideological differences between the two opposing blocs, many Haitians cite the maneuvers like the quorum ploy as the kind of behavior that prevents Haiti's Parliament from becoming a responsible political entity.
While the alliance, which has a majority in the lower house, blames Father Aristide's party for failing to make a quorum in the chamber of deputies, Mr. Norzeus points out that the alliance has had no problem rounding up enough legislators to pass business it wants approved.
Mr. Norzeus has been one of the few supporters of Father Aristide to attend Parliament recently and has spoken out openly against the attack on the exiled President's party. "I went because the country is facing a difficult situation," said Mr. Norzeus, a soft-spoken man who is under the protection of a foreign embassy. "I am a political man and as such I have to take my responsibilities."
Mr. Norzeus, a 30-year-old lawyer who represents the southern region of Les Baraderes, has been waging a campaign to shed light on the seriousness of the threat of violence that Father Aristide's supporters face.
He met Father Aristide in 1987 and has been a close friend of his ever since. An organizer of grass-roots organizations, he was elected for the first time in 1990 in what is regarded by many as the only democratic election in the country's history.
 
Declining Ranks
 In principle there are 27 Haitian senators and 79 members of the Chamber of Deputies. But because of deaths, death threats and a bogus election in January there are now only 17 senators and 61 deputies. The Senate is regarded as narrowly in favor of Father Aristide; the Chambers of Deputies is controlled by his opponents.
In the country's struggling democracy, the Parliament is relatively young. Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier, dissolved it a few years after he took office in 1957, when he declared himself President for Life, and the Parliament only resumed any useful function after the departure of his son, Jean-Claude Duvalier, in 1986.
Mr. Lasrosiliere, who describes himself as an independent, said that 29 years of rule by the Duvaliers, characterized by social and economic injustices, paved the way for a radical leader like Father Aristide and that after a failed experiment to the left the president should be more of a moderate.
During the eight months Father Aristide served in office before he was overthrown, the Parliament tried to flex its muscles only once, by summoning the Prime Minister. Some members were intimidated by mobs, and others were beaten. More recently, guns are drawn almost as often as words are exchanged.
Parliament is "not a Haitian invention," Mr. Larosiliere said. "It's human nature when you live with a brother he is the first one you fight with."

HEADLINE: Train to the Plane: Will It Ever Fly?

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
When the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey first proposed a light rail system that would finally link New York City's airports to Manhattan by sleek, quiet electric trains, people cheered. But now that the plans are nearing completion -- with a proposal to put the Manhattan terminal in one of the worst traffic spots in the city -- rumblings of opposition are surfacing.
Just about everyone recognizes the need for better access to Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports, where congested highways are the principal transportation connection to the rest of the city. 
 But the proposed location of the Manhattan terminal, on East 59th Street near Third Avenue, has made many people queasy. The neighborhood is already a nightmare for motorists, with traffic from the Queensboro Bridge flowing into an area teeming with office workers and shoppers on the edge of the residential Upper East Side.
Accompanying that fear of congestion is a rising chorus of support for extending the rail line to Grand Central Terminal, even if it means spending more money on the project and taking longer to build it. Grand Central is a more convenient location, the argument goes, and can better handle hordes of new commuters.
 
A 100-Year Plan
 "If this system has to last for 100 years, what's another $500 million?" said Brenda Levin, a member of the New York City Planning Commission, referring to the additional amount that Port Authority officials say it would cost to run the train all the way to Grand Central.
The Port Authority has held 122 community meetings to explain the $2 billion undertaking, which is scheduled to be completed in 2003 and is one of the largest public works projects in a half-century. Officials painstakingly defend what they say is the internal logic of the proposed route that wends 20 miles from Kennedy Airport to 59th Street almost entirely along public rights of way.
The present proposal enjoys major political backing from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor David N. Dinkins and others. But three community boards whose districts touch on East 59th Street, as well as the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, have also voiced concern about the proposed terminal site.
Originally, the Port Authority was going to end the rail line in Long Island City, Queens, but critics immediately dubbed any system that stopped short of Manhattan a road to nowhere.
Last year, when the Port Authority realized it could use the lower outer roadways on the Queensboro Bridge for the railway, planners began examining sites on 59th Street for the terminal. They seem to be zeroing in on the old Alexander's department store on Third Avenue between 58th and 59th Streets, which is empty. But two other sites east of Third Avenue are under consideration.
A Third Avenue terminal could neatly connect the rail line underground with the the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 and the N and R subway lines, and would make it more accessible to workers in midtown, officials say.
While studies indicate that taxi traffic in the terminal area would grow by 410 vehicles from 4 to 5 P.M. alone each day, the Port Authority has proposed steps to mitigate traffic. Running a jitney from major hotels to the terminal, rerouting traffic onto the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and creating two new lanes that would bisect the terminal building's ground floor for taxi use would reduce congestion, said Edward J. O'Sullivan, director of the Port Authority's airport access program.
In addition, the Port Authority estimates that there would be 4,300 fewer vehicles on the streets of Manhattan each day as a result of a new airport rail system, 760 fewer from 4 to 5 P.M. alone.
 
Money's Not Everything
 Even if there were additional money above the airport user fees dedicated to the project to pay for a Grand Central link, the Port Authority would not automatically shift gears. Studies show that there are the same number of potential airport commuters within a mile of each site.
Extending the line from 59th Street to Grand Central would also require condemning property, Mr. O'Sullivan said, and likely entail tunneling through schist under Madison Avenue and ripping up the road to relocate utility lines and pipes. A terminal on East 59th Street, however, would be relatively simple to construct and could be achieved without condemnations.
And while advocates of a Grand Central link note that it would allow easy access to Metro-North commuter lines, focus groups have indicated that suburban passengers would continue to drive to the airports regardless of where the terminal was situated. "Psychologically, people think of Grand Central as a major transportation hub, which it is, but it's not necessarily where the airport passengers are coming to and from," Mr. O'Sullivan said.
Once environmental impact studies are finished, the Federal Aviation Administration ultimately has to sign off on the project, which would be financed by a $3 fee that has been collected since last summer on departing passengers at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark airports. If approved, the rail system could be under construction by 1996.
 
A Sure Thing: Complaints
 As the rail link moves from concept to concrete plan, opposition is certain to mount. "Motorists are going to complain like crazy about losing capacity on the Queensboro Bridge, and there'll be opposition from residents over traffic congestion," said Jeffrey M. Zupan, of the Regional Plan Association, an independent research group.
Mr. O'Sullivan calls the 59th Street terminal location the "$64 question" and says that if it can't be resolved, the train won't come to Manhattan. That makes some critics wonder just how open the process is.
"We hear a lot about how alternatives are going to be considered in the environmental impact statement," said Jess A. Velona, chairman of the airport access subcommittee of Community Board Six "But all the presentations focus on a single route and terminus."
And Ms. Messinger, the Borough President, asserted this week that East 59th Street "was not a part of town that could easily adapt to 400 to 600 taxis an hour" and predicted "severe economic impacts."
But none of the criticism has yet to faze Stanley Brezenoff, who as head of the Port Authority, considers the airport link crucial to the city's welfare. "This is the one megaproject that perhaps can be built," he said, "and it's not unreasonable that people press us on some of these critical issues."

HEADLINE: THE 1993 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Watch;
Dinkins Draws a Crowd; Giuliani Plays Solitaire

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
In the final campaign week as seen on television, Mayor David N. Dinkins wrapped himself in the cloak of his incumbency, buoyed by an all-star cast of Hollywood and Washington celebrities. Rudolph W. Giuliani, in contrast, played the Lone Ranger, poised to avenge four years of municipal evil with no big guns by his side, no fancy munitions at all beyond faith, family and a handful of turncoat Democrats.
As Mayor Dinkins leaned into the televised embrace of Barbra Streisand, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Tipper Gore, his Republican-Liberal challenger appeared proudly on the evening news beside his latest supporter, Andrew S. Fisher of the Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation. As Mr. Dinkins clasped hands with President Clinton ("a friend of mine from Hope, Arkansas"), Mr. Giuliani stood alone at a podium before four questioners on WCBS-TV in a hand of political solitaire that was supposed to have been a debate. 
 The Mayor aired aggressive new commercials that sought to portray his opponent as hot-headed and cold-hearted. Mr. Giuliani introduced a warmer side of himself in ads and interviews, crinkling his eyes and laughing frequently in what seemed to be either the giddiness of genuine confidence or the last-minute determination to lift his mask of stiffness.
 
Increased Visibility
 After a month of spotty coverage, this was the week to flip the dial and find the candidates everywhere, talking back-to-back if never face-to-face. Still, on Thursday, a peak news day, when Mr. Clinton came to town and Mr. Giuliani participated in his one-man debate, the mayoral campaign did not even lead the 11 P.M. newscasts -- losing out to an abducted child struck by a train and to the raging fires in Southern California.
Despite professing their desire to keep above the fray, the candidates, yet again, performed for the cameras with a take-this, take-that childishness. "Frankly, I don't think he likes New York City very much," Mr. Dinkins said in a WABC-TV interview, the campaign equivalent of insulting his opponent's mother. Mr. Giuliani, however, had spoken with exuberant hyperbole about the city in a New York 1 News interview Wednesday: "To the extent that human civilization in 1993 has a central place, that's New York City," he said.
When Mr. Dinkins explained the city's loss of jobs as the legacy of 12 years of Republican rule, it was Mr. Giuliani's turn to be petulant. "That's the kind of time warp he's in," he said of the Mayor on WNBC-TV. "He probably thinks that Ronald Reagan is still the President."
As the incumbent, Mr. Dinkins was able to use television to greater advantage than his opponent. He could make news simply by fulfilling the duties of his office, as when he rushed to Jamaica Hospital on Wednesday to check on police officers who had been shot. He could surround himself with the trappings of his position, granting breakfast interviews on the porch of Gracie Mansion.
Mr. Giuliani, in contrast, was always portrayed in television images as a candidate, shaking hands at Queens diners, donning a yarmulke at Brooklyn synagogues, dancing with elderly women at senior centers in the Bronx. In interviews, Mr. Dinkins sought to cast the pure candidate's role as something crass, as self-interest rather than political purpose. Talking to Gabe Pressman on WNBC-TV, Mr. Dinkins said that his own economic plans were "a product of more than a year's work" rather than "dreamed up by three people in a back room at election time."
 
'Not Managing the City'
 But incumbency is a double-edged sword. And Mr. Giuliani has used it to jab the Mayor again and again. "He's just not managing the city," the challenger said often. "I'm going to have to clean up the mess he's made."
For weeks the Giuliani campaign has used surrogates to sell the candidate on television, from his wife and his mother to a taxi driver, deli owner and butcher. But this week, the candidate moved front and center, both in the first commercial to feature him talking directly to the camera and in innumerable interviews.
He took particular advantage of the one hour of prime-time television given him by WCBS-TV when Mr. Dinkins refused to participate in a one-on-one debate, managing to massage all the sound bites of his campaign into a fluid, coherent presentation.
The adrenaline of the final stretch that pumped Mr. Giuliani into higher spirits than previously seen proved puzzling to some reporters. WNBC-TV's Ti-Hua Chang, for one, could not help but comment on his peculiar ebullience. "Rudolph Giuliani," he noted, "seems tickled pink to be behind by 9 points" in the News 4/Daily News poll.
But that giddy good humor was fading by week's end when Mr. Dinkins launched a harsh commercial that included a clip of Mr. Giuliani's using an expletive in addressing a rowdy police rally. For the next few days, Mr. Giuliani promised, he would give as good as he got. And television is sure to be a principal arena for the final rounds.

HEADLINE: THE 1993 CAMPAIGN: New Jersey;
X Marks the Spot the Candidates Will Watch on Election Day

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J., Oct. 29

 BODY:
There is a political map of New Jersey that some politicians carry around in their minds. It shows the state's political landscape as an enormous, misshapen X.
In this map, the line that starts at top right and drops to the bottom left is the New Jersey Turnpike, connecting the state's big cities -- Newark, Elizabeth, Trenton, Camden -- as it runs through the Democratic Party's old urban power base. 
 The other line is the Garden State Parkway. Everything from its name to its ban on trucks speaks of a suburban, white-collar Republicanism. Its path meanders from the old North Jersey suburbs of Bergen County through Monmouth and Ocean Counties to the new, tax-shy settlements of the shore.
 
Balance of Power Shifts
 Over the years, the balance of power in the state has been shifting from the turnpike to the parkway, said Stephen Salmore, a professor of political science at Rutgers and an occasional Republican consultant who has transformed the highways into political metaphor.
"In the 30's, 40's and 50's, when the turnpike vote turned out to vote, the Democrats won the state," he said. "Now the axiom is that the candidates who win the Garden State Parkway win the election."
Where the two roads cross here in central Jersey also happens to be where the state's political crosscurrents are most turbulent, a quality that was vividly illustrated in the 1991 legislative races, the election in which Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase was just about the only topic. In the anti-tax backlash, Republicans swept all the seats in 6 of the state's 40 legislative districts. Three of those districts -- the 14th, 18th and 19th, which had been controlled by Democrats -- lie here at the state's waist.
Mr. Florio and his Republican opponent, Christine Todd Whitman, will be watching this area closely on Tuesday. The will look at exit polls and early returns to see whether one-time Florio supporters will return to the Democrats, both in the governor's race and legislative contests, either because they have decided to lay aside their anger with him or because they find some of Mrs. Whitman's positions unpalatable.
 
Voters' Ambivalence
 If voters like Richard Toth are any indication, the message may take a while to sort itself out.
Mr. Toth, a health safety auditor from Milltown, in the 18th District, voted for Mr. Florio in 1989, but on a recent sunny afternoon spent not catching any fish from Lake Farrington, he gave the undecided voter's refrain: Whitman. No, maybe Florio after all. No, Whitman.
"Florio won't run on his record and give people a reason to try him again," Mr. Toth said. "If he won't run on his record, all people have are their memories, and in his case, the memories are all bad."
Mr. Toth says he will make the decision Election Day. "It'll probably be Whitman, but it could be Florio. It's going to be how I feel Tuesday morning."
 
Anyone but Florio
 Not so Diane Rossiter, an Edison housewife who does volunteer work for the P.T.O., the Altar Guild and the Girl Scouts. She too is a one-time Florio supporter, but the tax increase has come between her and her history of voting Democratic.
"My personal choice would be for anyone who isn't Florio, and I don't care who knows it," she said. "It doesn't matter what his or her name is, as long as it isn't Florio and as long as she isn't a convict, I'll vote for her."
Mrs. Rossiter and her husband, who transports toll booth receipts for the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, fall into what Dr. Salmore says is the "middle-middle-middle" category: middle class, middle aged, middle income. These voters predominate here in Middlesex County, he said. They registered the biggest defection from Florio and the Democrats in 1991, he said, and are vital to Mrs. Whitman if she is to offset Mr. Florio's inroads into some communities farther up the Garden State Parkway in Morris County.
 
A Republican Loyalist
 William Haacker, an accountant who lives in East Brunswick, said he would support the Republican because he has always been a Republican.
It was true, he volunteered, that the Republican-run legislature wiped out his homestead rebate and doubled the cost of his elderly mother's prescriptions under the state health plan by cutting the sales tax. Governor Florio has made much of the fallout from the rollback, but Mr. Haacker holds all politicians equally at fault.
"It's a choice between two evils," he said cheerfully. "They're all gutless wonders."
In Trenton, Drew Mueller, a carpenter, spoke up for Governor Florio.
"On the taxes, we're always going to have them," he said over the hubbub of the after-work crowd at Larry's Corner Tavern on Mulberry Street, where a bumper sticker on the wall reads, "If Florio's the Answer, Then It's a Stupid Question."
"I was against him when the taxes went through, but the main thing for me is, we're starting to get the housing construction business back, so I guess the taxes aren't hurting business that much anymore. So yeah, I'm for him."
 
Florio's Base
 When he represented Camden in Congress, Mr. Florio considered interior South Jersey, in Camden and Gloucester Counties, his base, and always counted on a heavy turnout for him below Trenton to offset the Republican strength in the north.
Yet in the last decade, the landscape has changed. Thousands of professionals have been drawn to new housing developments in the scrublands west of Atlantic City. From the north, moving south along the Garden State Parkway, other subdivisions have sprung up in Ocean and eastern Monmouth Counties to house a new generation of young commuters and elderly, tax-averse retirees.
Environmental issues, a strong Florio suit, do not loom as large in the more open reaches of the south as they do in the congested north, Dr. Salmore said. At the same time, hunting and gun ownership is more common in the south down to Cape May, whose southern tip, South Jerseyans are proud to point out, reaches below the Mason-Dixon line.
Without those two elements of Mr. Florio's appeal to hold them, South Jersey's voters are becoming less predictably Democratic.
Tom Dresch, a 35-year old security consultant, is one of these newcomers. As a young father and a first-time homeowner, his chief worries are about the economy.
"My parents were Democrats right down the line because they think Republicans are unfair to the little guy," he said. "I'm more interested in seeing the business climate be strong, and I think it's obvious that Whitman would be better for that."

HEADLINE: On Bid Rigging and Price Fixing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Michael Sproul ("Before Setting Antitrust Policy, Study It," Viewpoints, Oct. 10) asserts that the Department of Justice "has never examined" the price effects of the price-fixing and bid-rigging schemes it prosecutes. (He examined 25 cases and found that prices did not fall following indictments or convictions.) On the contrary, the department commonly studies the price effects of conspiracies. These studies typically are not placed in the trial record, however, and therefore normally cannot be made public. 
 In a soon-to-be published paper, two of my colleagues and I report on the effects of a typical recent bid-rigging scheme. We found that the scheme raised prices of frozen seafood purchased by the Department of Defense by 23 percent to 30 percent for more than four years. Prices fell precipitously when the conspirators discovered that they were under investigation.
A major flaw in Mr. Sproul's study is that he examined the behavior of prices following indictments and convictions. As the frozen seafood conspiracy illustrates, prices are likely to have already fallen from conspiracy levels by the time of indictment.

HEADLINE: Alfie, Oh Alfie, What Can We Do With Ye?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "For Best Results, Forget the Bonus" (Viewpoints, Oct. 17), Alfie Kohn suggests that rewards are dangerous. Extrinsic rewards such as money, praise and recognition will, according to him, undermine intrinsic interest in rewarded activity. If this is so, it is strange that his own attacks on rewards persist, since they have surely earned him money, praise and recognition. 
 Fortunately, his thesis is false. I say "fortunately" since this country is a meritocracy -- a social and economic system that values talent and hard work and has generally rewarded them. Where the system has been most faithfully implemented, America is a world leader. Where rewards have not been closely related to performance, as in much of education, America has fallen behind.
Do rewards really undermine interest? Rupture relationships? Deter risk taking? There are studies that show negative effects from rewards, just as there are studies that show negative effects from aspirin. But the vast majority of studies show that rewards, properly used, result in better performance, more productivity and even more creativity -- without adverse side effects.
Mr. Kohn argues that our society should abolish the reward system that recognizes sustained effort and the productive use of knowledge. Ironically, one can obtain money, praise and recognition for arguing against those rewards for others.

HEADLINE: Bruce Babbitt's Landscape, at Risk

 BODY:
For months, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has been trying to persuade Congress to accept a small increase in grazing fees and new regulations to halt the deterioration of 260 million acres of public rangeland. And for months, he has been frustrated by Republicans determined to embarrass President Clinton and by a small but ornery group of Western Democrats determined to preserve a way of life that exists mainly in their minds.
An exasperated Mr. Babbitt now says he will impose the fees and regulations by administrative fiat, which is his right under the Federal rule-making process. But that is not the outcome he had hoped for. 
 A legislative solution is far preferable to administrative fiat, if only because Congress is less likely to tinker with it later. On a deeper level, the Senate's refusal to enact this modest reform spells huge trouble for Mr. Babbitt's more sweeping ambition to reverse not only 12 years of Reagan-Bush indifference to the environment but an entire century of federally sponsored exploitation of the public lands.
The Administration's environmental agenda includes proposals to charge royalties on gold and other minerals now mined on Federal land at no cost, reauthorization of the 1972 Clean Water Act and, most contentious of all, renewal of the Endangered Species Act.
If the Senate's behavior on grazing fees is any guide, these and other environmental initiatives are now seriously at risk. There's not much Mr. Clinton can do about the Republicans, but he can whip the dissidents in his own party into line. Unless he does so, his pledge to become the "environment President" George Bush promised to be but wasn't is almost sure to go unfulfilled.
Mr. Clinton originally included the higher grazing fees in his budget but caved in when a bipartisan cadre of Western senators threatened to torpedo his entire economic package unless the fees were removed. Mr. Babbitt then said he would raise the fees on his own authority, at which point the House and Senate agreed to a compromise -- now blocked by a Senate filibuster led by a few self-appointed Sons of the Prairie who have invoked everything but John Wayne to make their case that higher fees will destroy a vanishing way of life.
The fees will "do those old cowboys in," warns Senator Alan Simpson. "We are defending a Western life style [against] this Administration's war on the West." For sheer hyperbole, few can match the Wyoming Republican, but his views are shared by Democrats like Max Baucus of Montana, Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, and Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad of North Dakota.
Their arguments are nonsense. Under present law, ranchers are charged $1.86 to graze one cow and one calf for a month. That's one-fifth the going market rate on private land. The compromise bill would raise that fee, on average, to $3.45, yielding a meager $20 million extra over four years to help restore damaged lands. There's no evidence so far that the fees will drive even smaller ranchers off the land. In New Mexico, where state fees have doubled to $3.41 a month, no ranchers have quit and people are still lining up for permits.
Moreover, as The Times's Timothy Egan pointed out in an article on Friday, many of the ranchers who would pay this fee are hardly marginal dirt farmers. Mr. Simpson's "old cowboys" include the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, with 800,000 acres under its control; the Mormon Church; a Japanese conglomerate, and some of the wealthiest families in the nation. In all, 28,000 ranchers hold permits to graze their livestock on 260 million acres of public land. That comes to just under 10,000 acres per rancher, and most of them profit hugely from one of the great bargains in the Federal store.
One Western Senator with a firmer grip on reality is Harry Reid, a Democrat from Searchlight, Nev. Mr. Reid, who helped write the Senate compromise, agrees that below-market fees are an indefensible public subsidy. But what really offends him is the Simpson-Baucus fantasy that the West's future lies entirely in the hands of 28,000 ranchers who hold permits to graze on public land, not the 50 million others who also live there.
"I think it is important that we reject gridlock and do it now," Mr. Reid said on the Senate floor when debate began. "I ask [my colleagues] to reject the demagoguery that comes from those who represent a West that no longer exists."
Mr. Reid and the pro-Babbitt forces will try one more time to break the filibuster, possibly early this week. Perhaps by then the opponents will have come to their senses, realizing that their narrow allegiance to a small interest group, not to mention their misplaced romanticism, threatens more than Mr. Babbitt's effort to bring responsible stewardship to the public lands. It also emboldens all those who wish to undermine the rest of the Administration's environmental agenda.

HEADLINE: Iraq Raid Stirs Doubts on Clinton Policy

 BODY:
To the Editor
An article by Seymour M. Hersh in The New Yorker suggests that the Clinton Administration had inconclusive evidence for its charge that Saddam Hussein was responsible for an attempt to assassinate former President Bush in Kuwait (news article, Oct. 25) -- and thus for the bombing of Baghdad. This raises important questions, which require Congressional investigation. 
 The bombing won almost unanimous Congressional support and gave President Clinton a crucial lift in public opinion polls. Nevertheless, critics at the time -- including you in "Was This Strike Necessary?" (editorial, June 28) -- questioned the factual basis of President Clinton's act, its international legality and its wisdom as foreign policy. The critics were dismissed, as usual in the euphoria following a military strike against our archetypal enemy. But the facts and questions must now be openly aired and fully explored.
In examining the June 26 raid against Iraq, Congress must address broader issues: the honesty and judgment of President Clinton's national security staff, as well as the soundness of major elements of the Administration's policy. Political risks seem to have driven the Administration into extreme positions that are politically safe, but objectively dangerous.
This is true not only of the President's policy toward Iraq (where we insist on sanctions that are hurting civilians, and where even allies such as Turkey are opposed), but also toward Russia (where the rhetoric of democracy masks President Boris N. Yeltsin's authoritarian nationalism, and where we are responsible for blocking any moderation of economic shock therapy).
Representative Frank McCloskey's call for Secretary of State Warren Christopher's resignation (Op-Ed, Oct. 24) is particularly valuable in that Mr. McCloskey goes beyond easy criticisms of the "effectiveness" of our policies on Somalia and Haiti. He takes on the far more important question of our policy toward Russia. It is an index of the deficiency of conventional wisdom that the Russian policy is often reckoned the Administration's one success, along with the raid on Baghdad.
Congress must now take an unusually independent look at both the issues and the officials who are responsible for them. President Clinton's quest to protect himself from the Republican right on foreign policy will not protect the nation from the enduring costs of the errors to which it leads.

HEADLINE: THE 1993 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Trail;
Hillary Clinton Praises Florio's Opposition to Assault Weapons

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, N.J., Oct. 30

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton flew to New Jersey for the second time in 10 days today to stand by Gov. Jim Florio, endorse his ban on assault weapons, and then extol him as the candidate for women.
Mrs. Clinton's 20-minute speech in a damp and drafty hangar at the Essex County Airport was the highlight of a busy Saturday of campaigning in which Mr. Florio attended rallies in Atlantic City, Vineland and Turnersville in southern New Jersey, flew here by helicopter, and then went to Camden to attend a children's Halloween party and meet with black and Hispanic officials. 
 Mrs. Clinton praised Mr. Florio for resisting the pressures of the National Rifle Association in his attacks on assault weapons.
"He stood up to the forces that have profited from the violence that has stalked our streets too long," she said. "What you do Tuesday will send a huge signal across the country. I cannot overstate how important this is, to stand by a Governor who has not flinched. This is a battle for the future of our children. This is a battle for the safety of women."
The theme of the rally was "Women for Florio." The Governor stood on a podium in a hangar with 25 women. Besides Mrs. Clinton, they included his wife, Lucinda; Mae Smith, a Newark police detective; Marianne Espinosa Murphy, a former State Family Court Judge denied renomination to the bench, and 21 women running for the State Legislature and for county and local offices.
Mrs. Clinton chided the Governor's opponent, Christine Todd Whitman, about her frequent bus trips in the waning days of the campaign.
"Anybody can get on a bus," Mrs. Clinton said, without naming Mrs. Whitman. "The trick is to figure out which direction you're going."
Mr. Florio, she said, was going in the right direction. She appealed to women as well as men to vote for him.
"The voters of New Jersey can vote for one New Jersey woman or four million New Jersey women," Mrs. Clinton said.
 
'On the Fence'
 Jo Ann Chittenden of Delaware County shook Christine Todd Whitman's hand at T. J.'s Pancake House in Flemington and said: "I'm a registered Democrat. Why should I vote for you?"
Miss Chittenden and her husband, John Pulia, who describe themselves as "on the fence" in Tuesday's election, had come to the restaurant specifically to meet the Republican gubernatorial candidate during her Saturday morning campaign swing down Route 31 to Trenton. If Mrs. Whitman hopes to travel all the way to the State House, they are the kind of voters she will need.
Mrs. Whitman spent several minutes telling the couple why she felt she deserved their votes. She stressed economic issues.
"We've got to bring business back to the state," Mrs. Whitman said. "We've got to stimulate growth to create jobs." In answer to a question, she reaffirmed her stand favoring abortion rights.
Miss Chittenden said later that she remained uncommitted but had been "very impressed" with Mrs. Whitman. Mr. Pulia said that his discomfort with the Democratic incumbent, Gov. Jim Florio, was not over increased taxes but his feeling that Mr. Florio had been "untruthful" in his approach to them.
This was echoed by Joe Pierson of Hopewell, a Whitman supporter in the crowd at her next stop, addressing the Pennington first-aid squad. Mr. Pierson said that "the economic and credibility" issues decided him for the Republican.
Addressing rescue workers from volunteer squads, Mrs. Whitman praised volunteerism and promised to limit state government's local role.
"Obviously the government should set the standards," she said, "but after that it should get out of the way and let you do your job." She pledged a "state mandate, state pay" philosophy guaranteeing that programs created by the state would be optional unless money was provided for them.
She defended her promises on taxes: "Lowering taxes is not lowering taxes for a political campaign or a political speech. It's a philosophy of government."

HEADLINE: THE 1993 CAMPAIGN: Housing -- The Agenda;
Housing's Waiting List Includes Policy for Growth

SERIES: Mayoral Agenda: A periodic report on major issues facing the election winner - 7. Housing

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
Choosing to focus on one of the more visible aspects of New York City's chronic housing shortage -- homelessness -- the mayoral candidates have given scant campaign attention to housing preservation and redevelopment issues.
But the challenge to the city's next mayor -- the Democratic incumbent, David N. Dinkins, or Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican-Liberal -- will remain how to best use city housing resources in the face of shrinking revenues, and how to balance complex redevelopment needs with conflicting social and political interests. 
 There are 270,000 families on the waiting list for public housing. Many now wait 10 years or more to be placed. Yet Housing Authority officials say there are worrisome signs that neighborhood opposition to new public housing will jeopardize Federal financing for some of the 2,000 units in development.
Federal rules are similar to the "fair share" provision in the new City Charter, which says public housing and similar services should be spread throughout the city, rather than concentrated only in low-income areas. That policy, however, is generating political opposition in middle-class neighborhoods where some of the new housing is planned.
 
Landlord by Default
 On the fiscal side, the city is losing an estimated $130 million a year in tax revenues because of landlords who have lost their buildings in property-tax foreclosures. While officials say the city's portfolio of these units has been reduced by nearly 10,000 in the past four years, New York remains the landlord to the tenants in 30,000 such apartments.
Moreover, housing experts say a sharp rise in the number of apartment buildings in default raises the prospect of a new wave of foreclosures and abandonments. Statistics show that the number of residential properties in tax default more than doubled in 1992, to 8,428 from 3,999.
Most housing advocates give Mayor Dinkins credit for maintaining the city's housing initiatives despite fiscal constraints. This week, he unveiled a new package of programs intended to build on current initiatives. The most innovative among them are plans to turn unsold luxury co-op and condominium units into apartments for middle-income families and to put public housing residents into homes of their own.
Even as a worsening economy has tightened the city's finances, New York has stayed ahead of a 1986 pledge to create at least 47,000 new apartments before the mid-1990's.
The commitment, made by former Mayor Edward I. Koch, remains the city's most ambitious housing plan. During the Dinkins administration, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has created 22,000 apartments in formerly vacant buildings, much of it as permanent housing for the homeless; helped finance the rehabilitation of 21,000 units in privately owned buildings, and paid for some of the construction of 5,000 new homes for low- and moderate-income first-time buyers.
These and other home-ownership initiatives have helped revitalize neighborhoods throughout the South Bronx, Central and East Harlem and Brooklyn.
But Mr. Giuliani argues that the Dinkins administration has concentrated on programs that perpetuate the city's involvement in housing, rather than private participation. Most specifically, he has criticized the administration for holding too long to to buildings taken in taken in property-tax foreclosures. Mr. Dinkins does agree with Mr. Giuliani that more private participation is essential to any long-term solutions to the city's affordable housing crisis.
Except for remarks made during a televised debate with Mayor Dinkins and two other candidates in early August, Mr. Giuliani has not set a housing agenda or given a speech on housing matters. Mr. Giuliani has acknowledged the city's achievements. But the former Federal prosecutor, who was born in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, has said he still sees neighborhoods suffering from the effects of neglect. He sees landlords teetering on he brink of financial ruin as they struggle to pay taxes and maintenance bills on meager rent receipts.
Mr. Giuliani's advisers say his main goals would be to rid the city of the buildings that were taken over in tax foreclosures, greatly expand opportunities to own homes and use more resources to help owners of the crumbling buildings where low- and moderate-income renters live.
 
Focusing on Private Owners
 William J. Grinker, a Democrat and former head of the city's Human Resources Administration, is Mr. Giuliani's social policy adviser. In trying to reduce the buildings for which the city acts as landlord, he said, Mr. Giuliani would first restore a program that put these buildings in the hands of private owners.
"There were some abuses in POMP," he said, referring to the Private Ownership and Management Program, which was scrapped by the city during the Dinkins administration after complaints from housing advocates that some new landlords were not meeting their obligations. "But the city can't afford to ignore this source of housing managers."
Mr. Grinker said abuse could be prevented by increasing oversight, tightening the requirements and encouraging small, neighborhood owners to take the buildings rather than focusing on attracting large housing management companies.
Mr. Grinker said that under a Giuliani administration, more buildings would be released by encouraging residents to take advantage of the Tenant Interim Lease program, which sells buildings to tenants as low-income co-ops.
 
Incentives for Tenants
 "If you lifted some restrictions -- like the limit on the profit from resale -- more tenants would probably be interested," Mr. Grinker said.
To avert another wave of apartment building abandonment, Mr. Giuliani would carry out an emergency hardship program to help owners on the brink of default. It would use city resources and private lenders.
A centerpiece of Mr. Giuliani's housing policy would be the expansion of home ownership opportunities, Mr. Grinker said, adding that less would be spent on the development of rental housing and more on building new homes. Using the model of Shore Bank in Chicago, a private bank set up in low-income communities, Mr. Giuliani would stimulate neighborhood rebirth by financing both housing and business projects.
Mr. Grinker said that while Mr. Giuliani supported the "fair share" provisions of the new city charter, the candidate believed that Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development site and neighborhood regulations are unrealistic for New York.
 
Opportunity, not 'Nimby'
 H.U.D. requires new developments to be in in areas that are not already heavily populated by minorities.
"The issue is not Nimby," said Mr. Grinker, "but more a matter of opportunity and availability. The sites that are available tend not to be in neighborhoods that meet the H.U.D. requirements."
Felice L. Michetti, Commissioner of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, defended the city's housing policies. In past four years, the city has sold 12,400 renovated apartments to their occupants, to community organizations and to some private management firms, Ms. Michetti said. In the next four years, she said, the administration will try to speed up efforts to turn buildings over to nonprofit organizations, or private owners, including the tenants themselves.
"The city has put $2 billion into housing in the past four years," she said, "but what is significant is that we have gotten much more than the dollar-for-dollar value out of it because we have leveraged that money. We've become partners of nonprofit organizations and community redevelopment groups, lenders and the Federal government. And our goal is to do more of this public/private redevelopment in the future."
 
People Who Need a Boost
 She said the city would commit another $1.8 billion to produce and preserve an additional 48,000 units, but would also emphasize programs for people who need a boost to lift them out of public housing or rentals.
One such program, Project Choice, will offer Housing Authority residents chances to be owners through nonprofit housing corporations that build for moderate-income buyers.
Another program would make use of the thousands of vacant, unsold co-op and condominium units throughout the city. Using the resources of the New York City Residential Mortgage Insurance Corporation, the Federal Home Mortgage Administration and private banks, moderate-income families would be offered mortgages so they could buy these apartments.
 
 
The Series

This is the final installment of the Mayoral Agenda series. Earlier articles examined the city's impending budget crisis, Sept. 27; social services issues, Oct. 2; crime, Oct. 11; the economy, Oct. 18; the city's infrastructure needs on Thursday and education yesterday.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 1, 1993, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the New York mayoral campaign misstated the amount of a new Department of Housing and Urban Development grant. The city is to receive $37 million over the next year, and plans to use $20 million to hire 400 additional Housing Authority police officers. While the grant is projected to continue at the same level over the next five years, providing a total of $100 million to finance police hiring, that amount is not guaranteed.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "THE ISSUES: The Candidates On Housing"
Here are the candidates' positions on major housing and community development issues:
 
 RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI, REPUBLICAN/LIBERAL
 -- Would vastly increase home ownership opportunities.
-- Would move the city more quickly out of managing apartment buildings whose owners have forfeited for failure to pay taxes.
-- Wants to revitalize decaying neighborhoods through housing and commercial redevelopment.
 
 MAYOR DAVID N. DINKINS, DEMOCRAT
 -- Plans to create new ownership opportunities by converting failed co-op and condominum buildings to affordable housing.
-- Wants to create ownership opportunities for public housing residents.
-- Would more aggressively seek to have private corporations take over buildings managed by the city because of owners' failure to pay taxes.

Farewell to Macy's Sign: 'World's Largest Store'
 The sign on Macy's in Herald Square, proclaiming it "The World's Largest Store," has come down. An electronic replacement is to go up on Nov. 26 and start operating after Jan. 1. What kind of messages will the new version broadcast? Laura Melillo, a spokeswoman for the store, would say only that the sign "says that we are a retailer, and says something about shopping." 
 The sign will be 70 feet tall and 52 feet wide and sit 30 feet above the street. Macy's has had a "world's largest" sign in the space since 1932.
 
Former Helmsley Palace Going for $202 Million
 The New York Palace Hotel, once known as the Helmsley Palace, is about to be sold for $202 million to the offshore partnership Amedeo Hotels. The hotel, at 455 Madison Avenue (50th Street), came under the control of a court-appointed receiver, W. Thomas Parrington Jr., last April after a long dispute between Harry and Leona Helmsley and a group of limited partners who contended that mismanagement had led to losses of $10 million in 1991.
Thomas McConnell, senior manager at Kenneth Leventhal & Company, a New York consulting group that has been employed by the Helmsleys, said the price was high given the depressed real-estate market. "It's a one-of-a-kind situation," he explained. "The Palace is a big property and extremely well located."
But don't look for the signs on the Palace to change next week. "This is a very large transaction for a hotel," Mr. McConnell said. "It doesn't get done overnight."
 
Two Olive Gardens Will Open in Midtown
 General Mills will open two Olive Garden restaurants in Manhattan next year, joining an outlet in Kew Gardens that appeared in April. The chain, which offers Italian fare, family style, has 407 restaurants nationwide. The new ones will be at 47th Street and Broadway and at 34th Street and Eighth Avenue.
"It's not like we said in 1994 we are going into New York City," said Cathie Weinberg, a spokeswoman for the chain. "We are constantly looking for available property at the right price. Those areas happened to open up, and the timing and price were right."
 
Fewer Businesses Fail,But Total Is Still High
 Fewer New York City businesses failed in the first nine months of 1993 than in the same period last year, Dun & Bradstreet reports.
The number of business failures in the five boroughs dropped 9.4 percent. The construction industry fared worst with a 3 percent increase in failures; the number of failing companies in finance, insurance and real estate dropped by 15 percent.

On the City Politic: Voters' Round Table

 BODY:
Four New Yorkers came together for three hours last Sunday with Felicia R. Lee and Larry Olmstead of The New York Times to discuss the candidates and the issues in Tuesday's mayoral election and their feelings about life in New York. The participants were Melissa Woronoff, 20, a college student who divides her time between the Bronx and Manhattan; Ken Shung, 39, a free-lance photographer who lives in Manhattan; Jerolyn J. Minter, a retired college professor who lives in St. Albans, Queens, and Roger D. Fields, a "40ish" Harlem resident and the senior vice president of the United Block Front Street Association, a program in which ex-offenders build housing.
What follows are excerpts from their discussion.

What things are most important to you when you look at the quality of life in the city?
 ROGER FIELDS: No. 1 is crime, which, as an African-American, is very, very on my mind. And No. 2 is affordable housing. When one talks about upgrading and upper mobility in any community, it must be a safe community. And once you build housing, that housing, which may be comfortable and affordable, has to be in a safe neighborhood.
JEROLYN MINTER: I agree with much of what you're saying, but I think when you put things in order of priority, it's not crime first. Crime is an offshoot of something that I think is more deeply rooted. Attention to education and educational standards, economics, housing -- all are built upon the first fundamental, and that's learning how to understand someone who is different from you that you have to live next door to or in the community right adjacent to yours.
FIELDS: Well, I don't tend to agree with you. When one talks about empowering different ethnic groups, those communities must first have safe streets and must have affordable housing before one can no longer feel stressed. And one gets angry because one sees that one group is getting more than another group, which also causes division.
No. 2, if we talk about education standards, when you develop affordable housing and affordable home ownership, then those communities become mixed and those educational standards become more active, because the community is not monolithic nor mono-economic.
Melissa, what's your idea of the key areas?
MELISSA WORONOFF: Well, I would agree with Jerolyn. I would also add not only race but also class and religion. And I think that's what's great about New York City, but it makes things hard at times. I mean, to get those things to work out, that's really the starting point and then other things will follow.
KEN SHUNG: My concerns with the city have to do with crime. I think the real issue for me is, like, who's raising our kids? When there are two functional parents in the house, then you can maybe have the next generation of people that would want to not resort to crime. I just feel that you've got to start at home. If parents don't spend time with their children, then there's no love. When there's no love, the children don't grow up with any kind of sense of responsibility and moral obligation.
MINTER: I have a concern when I read statistics that come past my desk, that eight out of 10 African-American children are going to be brought up in single-parent families. What is going to happen to that poor mother who's going out working, trying to support that child. And she has to put that child in a daycare center if she doesn't get home until 5, and that daycare center or that school program is not going to be able to give them the kind of structure that they need. When they look and see Mama struggling to pay the rent and buy food, and on the corner is this drug dealer who has diamonds and is driving cars, what's going to happen? What happens is that person becomes the role model.
WORONOFF: I think it's interesting that there certainly are a lot more single-parent families today. But I think what needs to happen is that both our city and the country need to acknowledge that families are changing and need to accommodate for that, rather than try to change it.
What can the mayor of this city, whoever is elected, do about any of these issues? What are they really responsible for?
MINTER: They're responsible for selecting the people who are going to take care of the various city agencies and monitoring them. I would make sure these people are knowledgeable, decisive, have some humanist to them and are in contact with the needs of the people.
FIELDS: I would fire every single commissioner in the City of New York; that's the first thing I would do. The second thing, I would go to people who have grown up in this city, understand its problems, are not political. I would want my commissioners to be responsible to me, not to the Democratic or Republican or whatever leader placed them there.
MINTER: I have come to realize that in our society we aren't willing to give people time enough to bring about change. You can't come in and change things in four years that have been messed up for the last 12.
FIELDS: Wait a minute, Jerolyn, are you trying to tell me things were messed up in the last 12 years before David Dinkins became Mayor? This Mayor, he has more nepotism than any other mayor in the history of this city. He appoints Joyce Brown deputy mayor -- who happens to be married to Carl McCall, the person the Mayor appointed to the Board of Ed. He appoints Victor Gottbaum to the Board of Ed, and his wife to being Parks Commissioner. I can go on and on and on. I think that this Mayor has shown no leadership. I think this Mayor has gone to traditional clubhouse politics and has not reached out to the community. I think the city was much better four years ago than it is right now.
Who else wants to jump into that?
WORONOFF: I think the country was better off four years ago than it is now. I mean, the economy was better. When the economy goes down, you know, crime does go up. We have more homeless people. Fewer people have jobs; more people are being laid off. I wouldn't place that blame on Mayor Dinkins.
Ken, are you better off than you were four years ago?
SHUNG: Oh, what a question. I guess -- I don't know, I haven't been that alert in the last four years. Do I feel more fear when I walk down the street? I do.

The accusation has been that the Mayor panders too much to blacks. And that Mr. Giuliani has pandered too much to whites. Then the President came in and said that there are too many people in this city who are unwilling to vote for people who are different from themselves, be it because of race or religion.
SHUNG: Anyone who suffers from any kind of discrimination might find truth in that kind of statement. I think people go into the voting booths after all is said and done, and get very tribal and start to, like, push the lever they feel they can identify with.
FIELDS: I think that everywhere you go there are going to be people who are racist. But I think people are concerned about issues. And President Clinton, I thought, made an inappropriate statement which caused the campaign to become even more racially oriented than it is.
What should the Mayor do to build bridges to racial harmony?
MINTER: I believe that Mayor Dinkins has been systematically trying to build those bridges here in New York, initiating programs all the way toward bringing this into fruition.
FIELDS: In reference to Mayor Dinkins's leadership in building bridges, I did not approve of the way he handled Crown Heights. I did not approve the way he handled the Korean boycott. I did not approve of the way he dealt with the Washington Heights situation with the drug dealer, in which my tax dollars were used to bury him. I think when you build bridges, you build them in an objective and corrective manner. I think, unfortunately, in this campaign, no one is building any bridges.
MINTER: In terms of Giuliani, I don't think that he would be building bridges. He has set a tone with his activities that, to me, is negative and divisive. I will vote for David Dinkins, because I believe in his dream.
FIELDS: Well, let me tell you something. I'm not going to vote for David Dinkins. I'm going to vote, this ex-offender, this African-American, is going to vote for Rudolph Giuliani. I think his record in reference to civil rights when he was United States Attorney shows his concern. I don't see Rudy Giuliani as a police monster.
Tell me about welfare.
MINTER: To eliminate the high numbers of people on welfare, you have to improve the economic situation. You have to provide training for people so that they can fit into the economic arena for jobs. For mothers who have to work, you have to provide the services that will care for the child while the mother is in training on a new job. You have pockets of this happening. It's not happening across the board in large numbers because you're looking at money. Where do you get the funding for this?
FIELDS: You've been doing it for 30 years, and it hasn't worked, the social scientist's philosophy. This is this old liberal philosophy that has kept our community behind. We need to inform people very candidly. If you have children out of wedlock continuously, you are going to be punished. We must stop people from having six children from six different fathers.
No. 2, we cannot reward people because of the fact that they do not wish to work. I agree with you, we must provide jobs. But those jobs must be provided with the partnership between private industry and the government. The government cannot continue to absorb and create these make-believe jobs and cost taxpayers more money. Now the welfare system rewards you.
What is it that the mayor can and should do?
FIELDS: He should have an aggressive, aggressive program of finding fathers who are not paying. We need to have these people who are on temporary income maintenance, these Aid to Dependent Children, and these Workfare people actually participate in training and working and placed in private enterprises. We need an aggressive program like that. And Mayor Dinkins doesn't have that program.
MINTER: He has started some of these programs.
FIELDS: He hasn't started -- the only thing he has started is sitting there and playing tennis at Gracie Mansion.
WORONOFF: I would say that as far as welfare is concerned, we need to have programs that fit the people's needs, rather than programs that lead people into who we want them to be. If there are single mothers with children, then we need some sort of daycare for these children while the mothers learn the skills that they need to go out and work. We need support for our community members out there.
We're talking about ethics and values. What can any city administration do to affect values -- let's say, the homeless problem?
SHUNG: Well, those policies should not polarize people and put them on the margins of society. I think people tend to think: "Well, not in my neighborhood. Or not in my backyard. Or I'll just retreat and it won't happen." What happens is, they'll be sitting in a public school, or even a private school. And the child that grew up on welfare, that value system will be in the same classroom as your child who had maybe a nice upbringing, and those values will cross. This is a problem that America has to confront, that our value systems, whether you're rich or poor, and those class distinctions, are eventually going to cross paths.
MINTER: You know, another concern is health care. I think that a lot of women, particularly pro-choice women, may not be inclined to vote for Giuliani, because he has gone back and forth on the issue of abortion. I think that taking a stance on abortion is really taking a stance on women and how highly you value them.
FIELDS: Well, people are going to vote for David Dinkins, who at one time was not pro-sexual preference, and that's become pro-sexual preference.
WORONOFF: I'd also say that Giuliani's issues on homelessness and his 90-day policy is something that people are going to be looking at.
FIELDS: I think what he was talking about was that bureaucracies tend to drag their feet. And what he was saying was, "Within that 90 days, I want that person placed." I think he was using the concept that the Rev. Calvin Butts and the Abyssinian church do in Harlem, that you come to the shelter for a short period of time. And the first day you're there, you begin to look for employment and permanent housing.
Is the city doing enough?
SHUNG: To deal with homeless? The city is not doing enough. I think I don't even look for Mayor Dinkins to solve the world's problems. I look for him to start moving in the right direction, to build the bridge instead of break it down. . . .
MINTER: I'd like to tell you, I have not voted for Mayor Dinkins because he was black. I voted for him because I thought he was the best person to do the job. I'm proud of him because he happens to be an African-American. I feel that he sets a good role model for African-American children, who can look and say: "I can aspire, too. And doors will not necessarily always be closed to me." But I think he is a man, a human being, trying to do what I would like to see done in this city.
FIELDS: Well, I will tell you, it took a lot for me not to vote for him this time.
Because of race?
FIELDS: Because of race. It was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever made in my life. . . . You know, it's interesting, because you have such diverse people here. Here I am, supporting a relatively conservative candidate. And here are some of the traditional people who you would think would support a more conservative candidate, supporting a liberal candidate.
And what I'm hearing over and over is that we're all saying the same thing. Who would be the best mayor to take care of the quality of life and show compassion? We're all saying, who's going to show more compassion? All of us sitting here who are employed or have some income are saying we're concerned about those people who can't take care of themselves.

ELIAS CORNER (Diner's Journal)
(718) 932-1510; 31st Street and 24th Avenue, Astoria;  no credit cards accepted
This popular, tiny neighborhood spot serves some of the freshest seafood in New York City. There is a glass fish counter at the entrance and a tiny square kitchen behind it. The small dining room with a cooler for beer and wine, a plastic shark mounted on the wall, and the pale fluorescent lighting is convivial. There are no menus. Regulars walk over to the counter and pick their seafood. 
 If available, recommended dishes include charred fresh octopus drizzled with strong olive oil; deep-fried, pinkie-size Mediterranean fish called aherino; grilled porgies and red snappers; excellent taramosalata, the lemony fish roe puree; and tsatsiki: yogurt, mint and cucumber. (Diner's Journal: 7/26/91; article: 2/9/92)
 
LA FUSTA (Article)
(718) 429-8222; 80-32 Baxter Avenue, Elmhurst; $ no credit cards accepted
The atmosphere at this popular Argentine restaurant is casual and congenial. Tablecloths are checkered, and a South American mood is achieved with stucco and timber walls festooned with horse-racing memorabilia.
Parrillada is the Spanish term for a mixed grill of T-bone steak, marinated skirt steak, morcilla (blood sausage), chorizo (Spanish sausage), sweetbreads, kidneys, calf's liver and sausage. La Fusta's mixed grill comes with a jar of chimichurri, a piquant sauce made with garlic, parsley and olive oil.
Other dishes are empanadas de carne, redolent of garlic and minced olives; grilled chicken; filet mignon, and short ribs. (Article: 2/9/92)
 
PARK SIDE (Diner's Journal)
(718) 271-9274; 107-01 Corona Avenue (108th and 51st Avenue), Corona; all major credit cards
The sprawling, fern-festooned establishment has all the familiar trappings of a traditional Italian restaurant: brick arches, smoked glass panels, waiters in black tie and photographs of prominent Italians on the wall.
It differs from so many other old-fashioned red-sauce Italian restaurants in that the kitchen cares about textures and flavors, not just volume. Among dishes to look for are tiny clams oreganata; shrimp in garlic sauce; fried calamari; chicken parmigiano, and chicken scarpariello. Pastas are uniformly pleasing. (Diner's Journal: 5/28/93)
 
O LAVRADOR ($25 and Under)
(718) 526-1526; 138-40 101st Avenue, Richmond Hill;  all major credit cards
This rustic Portuguese restaurant and tavern attracts a steady mixed crowd for its homey fare and ethnic ambiance. The setting is different depending on which door you enter. On the left is a sometimes raucous tavern, to the right a more sedate informal dining room with oak floors, brick walls and dim lights.
Appetizers include broiled shrimp, and cherrystone clams in a broth flavored with Portuguese ham and chorizo, or with a garlic sauce. Entrees are gargantuan, served with heaping mounds of yellow rice and crisp french fries.
Best offerings are barbecued chicken marinated in hot sauce, pork and clams in a lemony brown sauce, and fried veal with white wine and lemon. ($25 and Under: 8/28/92)
 
TELLY'S TAVERNA (Diner's Journal)
(718) 728-9194; 28-13 23d Avenue, Astoria;  no credit cards accepted
Some of the best and most economical seafood buys can be found in the Greek neighborhoods of Astoria. Telly's Taverna is such a place, indistinguishable in its decor from many similar restaurants: whitewashed walls, a tiny glass-enclosed kitchen up front, maybe some photos of the old country, simply appointed rows of tables and a cooler for wine and beer.
The food is fresh and invigorating. For starters, sprightly Greek salads and purees can be recommended. Also good are taramosalata, a creamy and saline fish-roe spread, and skordalia, a garlic-powered puree. The best way to choose a main course is to inspect the fresh fish on display at the entrance. Look for the grilled octopus, grilled porgies, red snapper, striped bass and swordfish.
(Diner's Journal: 2/12/93)
 
UNCLE GEORGE'S ($25 and Under)
(718) 626-0593; 33-19 Broadway, Astoria;  no credit cards accepted
Open 24 hours a day, this bright, sprawling neighborhood place has a steady stream of patrons. Waiters orchestrate seating at family-style tables, meant to accommodate as many diners as possible.
The enticing food is what draws people in: leg of lamb, chicken and suckling pig slowly turning on spits near the window. Other recommended entrees are sauteed octopus in a lemony sauce, stewed rabbit, barbecued pork and lamb burgers. ($25 and Under: 1/15/93)
 
WATER'S EDGE **
(718) 482-0033; East River Yacht Club, 44th Drive at East River, Long Island City; $$ all major credit cards
This romantic spot with sweeping views of midtown Manhattan in a commodious setting attracts a dressy local crowd, including many tables of celebrants. The beguiling main dining room has dark wood panels, scalloped sconces, a fireplace and a piano bar.
Enticing starters on the current menu include pan-seared house-smoked salmon with a sweet onion-caper condiment; wild mushrooms fricassee in pastry with smoked mozzarella, and ragu of baby clams with cannellini beans in a broth of parsley and garlic.
Entrees include roasted cod with sauteed escarole and garlic; roast loin of venison with a sour cherry sauce and chestnut blinis, and braised filet mignon in chardonnay with cepes (wild mushrooms) and truffled mashed potatoes. (Review: 2/21/92)
 
ROUMELI TAVERNA *
(718) 278-7533; 33-04 Broadway, Astoria;  AE
This is one of the more reliable and diverting spots for distinctive Greek cuisine, and the stucco walls are hidden behind leafy vines ablaze with tiny bulbs. The casual dining room is packed nightly with a cheerful neighborhood crowd. At the entrance, a little glass counter displays the fresh fish and meat that will be the night's offerings.
The menu carries the familiar Greek standards: fat and flaky spinach pie; stuffed grape leaves; crisply fried eggplant, and a vibrant hummus (a chickpea and garlic puree).
Other recommendations are deep-fried calamari; grilled porgies, snapper or mullets, and a special of baby leg of lamb with potatoes served at room temperature. (Review: 11/20/ 87; article: 7/8/92)

Downtown Expansion Plan: Westward Ho!

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
Saying that downtown Flushing is bursting with pent-up demand for commercial and residential space, city planners last week recommended measures to encourage development in the central retail hub and channel future construction westward.
"This area has experienced a tremendous influx of new population, economic activity and investment," said Richard L. Schaffer, director of the City Planning Department. "It's a very vibrant business district that is literally bursting at its seams." 
 To open opportunities nearby, planners proposed rezoning a manufacturing district on either side of Prince Street, more than tripling the allowable commercial density and permitting residential development for the first time, Mr. Schaffer said.
The district manager of Community Board 7, Regina Colletta, said the movement toward Prince Street had started already. "It used to be only up to Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue where all the activity was," she said. "Now if you go on Prince Street, you'll see a lot of Asian restaurants and tourists visiting shops. So it's logical that we should go westward."
Before this or any other rezoning takes effect, it must go through environmental and land-use review, involving Community Boards, the Borough President, the City Planning Commission and the City Council, among others.
City planners also envision rezoning a roughly triangular 44-acre manufacturing district, bounded by the Flushing River, College Point Boulevard and the Long Island Rail Road, for commercial and residential uses.
A 14-acre parcel in this district, at College Point Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue, is owned by the Muss Development Corporation of Forest Hills. "Our intentions generally for the last 10 years have been to build a mixed-use development combining residential, commercial and retail," said Joshua Muss, president of the company.
When he learned that the rezoning was tied to the cleanup of the heavily polluted Flushing River, Mr. Muss expressed skepticism. "They're talking about 2010 and then they'll start the environmental review," he said, adding that city planners "don't have the mindset to plan the boroughs."
Mr. Schaffer said the rezoning along the Flushing River would begin "as resources allow over the next few years." This week, the City Planning Commission is to vote on a proposed 40-million-gallon sewer overflow tank on the river, which might be operating by the year 2001.
For the near future, city planners also recommended easing the parking requirements in the 13-block central retail area of Flushing, through which Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue both run. Under current rules, one parking space must be provided for every 300 square feet of floor space for general retail uses.
City planners acknowledged that "it is difficult to comply" with this rule on the moderately sized lots that predominate. Mr. Schaffer said the requirements were "unreasonably high" for a downtown that is well served by public transportation. The proposal seeks a parking space for every 400 square feet of floor space.
In a separate report, planners recommended rezoning Long Island City with a view to creating New York's fourth central business district. (Midtown Manhattan, lower Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn are the others.) A 36-block, arrowhead-shaped area west of the Sunnyside Yards, between Court Square and Queens Plaza, could become a "well-defined, pedestrian-oriented, high-density 24-hour urban center," the report said.

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
In Times Square, Turning Profits From 'Gin Mills'

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
AT 9 A.M. in Rudy's Bar, Ernest Schroeder sits on a stool counting money. There are many $100 bills, rolls and rolls of quarters, and everything in between. The cash, around $12,000, represents the weekend take from his four Times Square bars.
At a time when saloons everywhere are struggling, Mr. Schroeder says that his establishments -- Rudy's, the Full Moon Saloon, the Holland Bar and the Savoy -- are doing well. The bars are loud, the beer cheap, the food almost free -- and the clientele of a class that would not be terribly affected if the stock market crashed. 
 "These, for the most part, are not dirt-poor people, but most of them are one paycheck away from being on the street," said Mr. Schroeder, who has two co-owners.
So he sells people who can't afford much else a product they either don't need or need too much. Indeed, he calls alcohol "gasoline," for its potential to burn up individuals and their families. He rationalizes that if he didn't do it, somebody else would. He has no trouble articulating a larger purpose.
"Nobody wants to cater to the guy who wants to have a couple beers, read a couple newspapers and pick out a horse," he said. "Everybody in this whole world is trying to be high class, and the truth is we're all descendants of peasants."
It all rings at the old-fashioned cash registers, though it is not clear how much. "We're not on C.O.D., and that tells you something," said Jack Ertl, a co-owner, noting that many competitors now must immediately pay bills to get deliveries.
According to the Alcohol Research Information Service, the number of bars in the nation declined from 158,492 in 1986 to 149,516 in 1992, in New York State from 23,672 to 20,861. Local bar owners say the recession has made the decline much more precipitous in New York City, where rents are higher, though statistics aren't available.
Mr. Schroeder's strategy in bringing in customers is low prices: Draft Bud goes for $1.50 a pint, imported beers for $2.25, standard cocktails $2. "The key to our entire thing is price," he explained.
Mr. Schroeder, 50, rises at 3:30 A.M. so he can be around each bar just after the 4 A.M. closing and handle the money. This done, he takes a nap before the 8 A.M. opening. He then prowls his empire, starting with the Full Moon at 735 Eighth Avenue, which has a 50-foot-long bar, flashing red Christmas tree lights everywhere and, he says, not as many prostitutes as people think. Then there's the Savoy at 355 West 41st Street, a gay bar. And the Holland, at 532 Ninth Avenue, which is less than 10 feet wide, with just 14 stools and much conversation.
At Rudy's, 627 Ninth Avenue, where the trail starts and ends, there is the feeling of a time warp. The little round tables and banquettes date to 1934, and the ceiling fans rotate endlessly. Musicians are big customers, partly because Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane dominate the jukebox.
"The jukebox is a very powerful thing," Mr. Schroeder said. "It controls what kind of crowd you get."
As Mr. Schroeder goes from place to place, his ample belly leads the way and a graying ponytail waves behind. From his belt dangle dozens of keys and a jagged-edged can opener, too big to open a beer but just right to give a mugger pause. He lights a Pall Mall. On Ninth Avenue, he sees Frank, a numbers runner, and wordlessly hands him the usual $20.
"If I get lucky, I get $9,000," he said. "But I ain't gonna get lucky."
If Mr. Schroeder's life seems to contain all the elements of a country song, let it be mentioned that he ran away from his Orange, N.J., home at 14 with his friend Eddie Rabbit, who went on to become a country-singing star. Not that he had an uncomfortable youth as one of seven children of a chemical engineer who designed whisky distilleries.
An uncle owned a bar, and Ernest Schroeder loved going there even as a youngster. "Owning a bar is the only thing I ever wanted to do," he said almost wistfully.
But there were other things he did: Working as an orderly, putting in time in a factory. Earning a degree in business administration from Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., while working in the Post Office. Buying a Poughkeepsie tavern, the Shamrock.
Then his marriage collapsed and he returned to New Jersey. After stumbling around a bit, he and his brother began buying go-go clubs, ultimately owning six. But they didn't get along, and Mr. Schroeder left his brother with the bars. "Nobody wants to shoot his brother," he explained.
Mr. Schroeder found his way to Times Square and began bartending. Among his stops were the Savoy and Rudy's, under earlier ownership. But it was in a little bar in the same building as the Holland Hotel, then populated by welfare families, that he first became an owner and made his reputation.
At the Holland, he created a neighborhood feeling in an establishment inhabited by people with nowhere else to go. He had free Easter bunnies, cheap Christmas toys and other elements of home. Hot dogs were a nickel, beer a dollar and the boneless chicken dinner, a boiled egg, 9 cents. The pattern was established.
When the bar closed along with the hotel, Mr. Schroeder with his new partners opened the second Holland Bar a few blocks south. A flock of dipsomaniacal disciples followed.
Along the way Mr. Schroeder has learned a thing or two. He trusts no bartender. "There are no honest ones," he said, "only relatively honest ones." He caters to the customer: at the Full Moon, he has written out signs honoring the birth of a nephew of a regular customer. He has learned to guess customers' ages, partly as a result of being closed for 15 days last summer for serving an undercover, under-age policeman.
He has learned that the way to diminish the presence of prostitutes is to require that they pay for drinks and not let them approach customers. He has learned not to have television sets because they diminish conversation -- the best use of a bar, in his experience.
It all works with customers. "The days of the wonderful old local gin mills like this are gone," said Richard Sperle, a Long Island resident who stopped at Rudy's on his way to the American Museum of Natural History.
At a nearby stool, Carol Lopez added, "Beautiful people hang out here, really -- we're a family."
 
BAR HOPPING
How to Make Ends Meet
 
Here is how Ernest Schroeder, co-owner of four bars, keeps his stools full and costs down.

MARKUP: Saloons usually price their drinks 4:1, meaning a bottle of beer purchased wholesale for $1 is sold to the public at $4. Mr. Schroeder's markup is 3:1.

LABOR: To minimize costs, only part-time employees are hired. There are 20, making $32 to $50 for an eight-hour shift, not counting tips.

RENT: The main expense. At the Holland Bar, rent is $1,700 a month, with weekly sales of $2,800; at Rudy's, $3,000 with weekly sales of $5,000; at Full Moon Saloon, $6,000 with $6,500 in sales. Mr. Schroeder declined to reveal sales for the Savoy, bought last March in financial distress; rent is $3,200.

Health Plan: Out of the Gate

 BODY:
The Clinton health care plan, at a hefty 1,342 pages and 5 1/2 pounds, thumped into congressional in-baskets on Wednesday. This version differed from the one leaked last month, with revisions designed to increase the odds of the bill's passage. Among them: abortion coverage with a "conscience clause" that would exuse people with objections from having to perform the procedure; subsidies for small businesses with with as many as 75 workers, up from 50; the right to choose a doctor, even one outside the patient's plan. 
 Hilary Rodham Clinton told Congress that the Administration had no "no pride of authorship" and that some details were open to negotiation. These are highlights of the opening round of bidding.
 
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE
All Americans will be covered by health insurance by 1998, regardless of their medical or employment status.
 
People will be able to choose from three types of plans: traditional fee-for-service, health maintenance organizations or a combination of the two. H.M.O.'s will have to offer patients the option to seek care from a physician outside the organization, but this could carry an additional cost.
 
HEALTH ALLIANCES
Insurance will be administered through health alliances, which will pool the purchasing power of customers.
 
Generally, one alliance will cover a state or region. Corporations with more than 5,000 employees will be allowed to create their own alliances.
 
Alliances will negotiate with health providers and offer consumers a choice of plans, with details on each plan's cost and quality. Alliances will be allowed to reject only plans that do not meet state standards or ones with budgets that are 20 percent higher than the average of other plans in the area.
 
COST OF COVERAGE
Businesses will pay at least 80 percent of the cost of premiums for employees.
 
Employees will pay the portion of premiums that employers don't cover. The cost formula will be based on how expensive a plan they choose, with out-of-pocket expenses higher for those who are not in an H.M.O.
 
Costs for small businesses will be subsidized by the Federal Government. Caps on premium costs will range from 3.5 percent of total payroll for small businesses to 7.9 percent for large one's.
 
COST CONTROL
Insurance premiums will be controlled by law over five years to bring growth in health costs in line with general inflation rates.
 
A natioanl health board will set national and regional budgets.

HEADLINE: An Emergency Unit With Children in Mind

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER

 BODY:
MARQUIS JONES'S mouth drooped as he lay on an examining table in the emergency room of the children's unit of Yale-New Haven Hospital.
 "Show me where it hurts," the doctor said to the 7-year-old as her hands gently probed his belly. 
Marquis's mother, Valerie Jones, brought her son to the emergency room after he began vomiting and complaining of fatigue and headaches. "You're in a lot quicker than you would be if children were mixed with adults," she said, referring to the children's unit emergency room. "And there's less commotion for the kids to have to go through."
 
Designed for Small Patients
In other ways, too, the emergency room is equipped with children in mind. Blood-pressure cuffs, breathing tubes and other medical devices are available in various sizes to fit children of different ages. Similarly, the monitoring equipment is fitted with cables appropriate for small patients.
 But in many places across the nation children's needs in emergency care have been overlooked, while services for injured or seriously ill adults have improved, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Donald N. Medearis Jr., said in a report on emergency medical services for children. The report, published last July by the Institute of Medicine, a unit of the National Academy of Sciences, called for widespread improvements in children's emergency care. The report also recommended that Congress appropriate $30 million a year for five years to support state and Federal emergency service programs for children.
 Dr. Medearis is chairman of a 19-member committee that studied pediatric emergency medical services for two years and prepared the report. Noting that "children are not simply little adults," he explained that a child's normal respiration rate, heart rate and blood pressure are different from an adult's. Changes in those vital signs that indicate deterioration in adults may not be present in children. For this reason, treating children requires instruments of different sizes, different types and doses of medicine and psychological support appropriate for their age.
 
'Difficult to Evaluate'
 Caring for seriously ill or injured children also demands special diagnostic skills, said the director of pediatric emergency services at the children's unit, Dr. David Bachman. A 6-month-old with abdominal pain, for instance, could be suffering from any of a number of problems. "It's difficult to evaluate, because the child can't communicate, and some professionals get nervous about treating a child," Dr. Bachman said.
 Although ambulance services and hospital emergency rooms are assumed to be equally capable of caring for children and adults, it is not true, the report stated. In addition to better training for medical professionals who treat children, the report recommended that emergency rooms and ambulances be equipped with supplies and medical devices for children. Cervical collars used for patients with neck injuries, for instance, are not always available in children's sizes and can interfere with breathing.
 In Connecticut, state regulations require all ambulances to carry equipment in children's sizes, and the vehicles are inspected annually, said the chief of field services in the State Office of Emergency Medical Services, Marie Wilson. Emergency medical technicians must take a course that includes pediatric emergency care. "But it's not as extensive as most of us would like to see," Ms. Wilson said.
 
Regulations Under Consideration
 All hospital emergency rooms in the state are prepared to treat children, said a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Hospital Association, Julie Cox. She added that the State Office of Emergency Medical Services is preparing regulations under which a critically injured child would be considered for transfer from a local hospital to one with a pediatric intensive-care unit.
 Information on the number of children treated each year in emergency rooms across the nation is not available, Dr. Medearis said, although the report by the Institute of Medicine stated that children account for an estimated 25 to 35 percent of all emergency room visits.
 "What we do know is that some 21,000 children and young people under age 20 died in 1988 alone as a result of injuries," Dr. Medearis said. "That same year, nearly 21,000 more deaths occurred because of illness and other disorders."
 Injury is the leading cause of death in children more than a year old; for younger children, the major causes are developmental disabilities, birth defects, genetic problems and prematurity, said the chief and chairman of pediatrics at Yale-New Haven Hospital and the Yale School of Medicine, Dr. Joseph B. Warshaw. Since the children's unit opened last July, Dr. Bachman said, about 50 youngsters a day have been treated in the emergency room for head injuries, burns, lacerations, broken bones, asthma and flu. Automobile and bicycle accidents, drownings and poisonings are high on the list of the most common emergencies. In addition, increases in child abuse and the number of shootings and assaults among young people have placed greater demands on emergency services in general.
 
Few Training Programs
 Despite the growing need, there are few training programs in pediatric emergency care because it is an area of medicine that is still developing, Dr. Warshaw said. A survey of 85 percent of the emergency medicine residency programs in the United States in 1980 showed that an average of four months was dedicated to pediatrics, Drs. Stephen Ludwig and Gary R. Fleisher, authors of "Textbook of Pediatric Emergency Medicine," reported. Residents trained in the programs often had difficulty distinguishing a child with meningitis, or inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, from one with a high fever caused by an ear infection, they added.
 Now, however, pediatric emergency medicine is a recognized sub-specialty of pediatrics and emergency medicine, Dr. Ludwig and Dr. Fleisher wrote.
 In the future, hospitals that serve as regional centers for pediatric emergency services may be the most economical way of providing better care for Connecticut's children, said James L. Paturas, the director of emergency services at Bridgeport Hospital and a member of the committee that prepared the Institute of Medicine report.
 
Preventing Injuries
 Mr. Paturas and Dr. Bachman emphasized the importance of teaching children and their families to prevent injuries. Keeping poisons out of reach and insisting that children wear helmets while they're riding their bicycles are two of the most important precautions, Dr. Bachman said.
 Mr. Paturas expressed the hope that safety procedures will be passed down from one generation to the next. "You can't say enough about it," he said. "There's nothing we would like more than to be put out of business. The greatest asset we have as a nation is our young people."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 31, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Oct. 31 about the treatment of children in hospital emergency rooms misattributed a statement that Connecticut was preparing regulations on transferring injured children to pediatric intensive-care units. Marie Wilson of the State Office of Emergency Medical Services made the statement, not Julie Cox of the Connecticut Hospital Association.

HEADLINE: Upstart Airline Staying on Course

BYLINE: By BARBARA STURKEN PETERSON

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
IT is half past noon on a busy Monday at Newark International Airport. From his office across the road from the runway, Robert Iverson surveys the jets lining up for takeoff and consults his watch. It is almost departure time for Flight 9 to Orlando, Fla., on Kiwi International Airlines, the upstart airline he founded.
What Mr. Iverson, Kiwi's chairman, sees from his window, though, is a sobering view of his competition. In the last year, he has witnessed other newcomers open for business across the way, only to close down shortly thereafter. And the dozens of Continental Airlines jets parked on the tarmac at Newark are more evidence of the odds against Kiwi. 
 Earlier this year, Mr. Iverson accused the much larger Continental of trying to drive his airline out of business with predatory, or below-cost, prices. He did not file formal charges against Continental, however, because, he said, hefelt that such a case would be too difficult and costly to prove. Continental denied the accusations.
But even though skeptics predicted that Kiwi could not last against bigger and more experienced rivals, especially in a highly competitive market like Newark Airport, the airline recently marked its first anniversary and recorded a modest profit during the months of July and August.
"We are here because we've learned the lessons of those who have failed," said Mr. Iverson, who worked as a commercial airline pilot for nearly 20 years. "Those airlines that strayed from their original niche are no longer here."
 
The Budget Travel Market
 By his reckoning, Kiwi's niche is serving the budget travel market; it has lower costs than its larger rivals and can afford to charge lower prices. Kiwi also has at least one advantage over other fledgling airlines: financial support from the State of New Jersey.
Kiwi received a $1.7 million loan guarantee from the state's Economic Development Authority, which it redeemed at the Summit Trust Company. The airline has already repaid $700,000 of the loan and recently renegotiated a revolving line of credit with the bank so it can draw on the full $1.7 million amount.
"That's a unique angle," said John Eichner, chairman of Simat, Helliesen & Eichner, a New York aviation consulting concern, and a longtime airline analyst. "I don't know of any state that has done that with a start up airline."
Mr. Eichner said that while the odds against a small airline are daunting, Kiwi "is doing as well as can be expected." He added, "They've got the initial growing pains that any start-up airline might have."
Among the problems any new airline can face is cutthroat price competition from established lines. Kiwi operates 12 departures daily out of Newark to six cities, a tiny fraction of the 550 flights that depart the airport on various airlines each day. Even so, when a new airline cuts fares, competing airlines usually lower theirs to match the newcomer's prices and protect their share of the market.
When Kiwi started flying to Atlanta and Orlando, for example, Delta Air Lines lowered fares to match the newcomer's prices of about $100 one way. Continental did the same when Kiwi entered its turf. The difference, Mr. Iverson said, is that Kiwi charges low fares for all its seats, while the larger airlines tend to restrict the number of seats offered at a discount.
 
'He's Got a Chance'
 "I think he's got a chance to get the larger carriers to back off and to at least survive," Mr. Eichner said. "He seems to be getting by, and has at least enough cash to have his planes in the air."
Several other start-up lines were less fortunate. They either proposed or actually started service to Newark, but expired in the last year, said Vincent Bonaventura, general manager of the airport.
Skybus, a low-fare airline to Florida, and Ultrair, a luxury Houston-based line, both suspended service after a few months in business. Family Airlines, formed by a group of former Pan Am workers, announced a start-up date for coast-to-coast budget flights but failed to pass muster with the Federal Government. The latest casualty was a low-fare upstart named Jet U.S., which collapsed after seven days of service between Detroit and Newark last August.
"Ever since deregulation, it has been very difficult for new airlines attempting to enter the business," Mr. Bonaventura said. Many of the recent failures were victims of a tough economic climate, which has battered airlines both large and small.
Kiwi "seems to have the right balance between caution and aggressiveness," he said. "And it has an organization that is made up of people with many years of experience."
 
A Lot of Experience
 Kiwi's 620 employees possess an unusual amount of airline experience for a young company, averaging 20 years' worth. Virtually all them hail from three defunct airlines: Pan Am, Eastern and Midway. In part to spoof their grounded status, the founding employees chose to name the airline for the flightless Kiwi bird.
Many of those idled by the airline bankruptcies had few options for other employment; in recent years even financially healthy airlines have laid off workers. Mr. Iverson said he had tried to hire the most senior employees he could find; four pilots have already retired at the federally mandated age of 60 since the airline's startup.
For most of the workers, accustomed to large bureaucratic organizations, Kiwi is a sharp contrast. Paul Clements, director of sales development, and a resident of River Vale, worked at Trans World Airlines for 30 years before joining Kiwi in July.
Although T.W.A. is still flying, until recently it, too, was embroiled in lengthy bankruptcy proceedings, and Mr. Clements said he had left because of the uncertain atmosphere and plummeting morale there. Although a new airline is risky, he said, he was encouraged by the fact that many of Kiwi's workers volunteered their time for tasks that were not in their job descriptions.
 
Other Roles for Pilots
 "Here you have a very involved group trying to make this thing work," he said. He compared it to the early days of aviation, when airline executives were more likely to be pilots than financial experts.
He is often accompanied by a group of pilots when making sales calls at large companies, he said, which would rarely occur at a more traditionally structured airline.
Seasoned pilots can be found at Kiwi performing such unlikely chores as cleaning the interiors of the aircraft they fly. They also earn far less: Kiwi pays a captain $60,000 a year, versus more than $100,000 at big airlines.
The company was also able to keep costs down by securing aircraft leases at favorable rates because of a surplus of planes. That means it can make money by filling just over half of its seats, a threshold many larger airlines would envy.
It was because of such efficiencies that the airline was able to report its first operating profit in July, after nine months of service. By the third week of September, it had carried a half-million passengers, and was taking in more than $7.5 million in sales on a monthly basis, up from $1 million at its startup. Its fleet has grown, from two to eight jets, and its work force has tripled.
The airline serves Atlanta; Chicago; Tampa, Fla.; San Juan, P.R., and Orlando, Fla. It is scheduled to add twice-daily service between West Palm Beach, Fla., and Newark tomorrow.
 
Taking a Cautious Approach
 Kiwi will add to its fleet and route map cautiously, Mr. Iverson said. "Growth, that's a scary word," he said, citing the grim record for airlines like People Express that collapsed after wildly expanding in the mid-1980's.
Mr. Iverson witnessed firsthand the upheaval in the business as a commercial pilot for Eastern Air Lines for 18 years. He walked off his job along with other striking pilots and mechanics at the troubled airline in March 1989.
After working briefly for Pan American World Airways, which, like Eastern, expired in 1991, Mr. Iverson began to explore starting up an airline from scratch with a group of fellow pilots who had worked at Eastern.
Banks were reluctant to lend money to a new airline, given the unencouraging track records of such ventures. Kiwi's main source of capital came from 100 pilots who each put up $50,000 for a stake in the new company on top of the $2 million it privately raised from employees plus an additional $2 million in seed money from outside investors and the aid from New Jersey.
Kiwi, in fact, says it is the only jet airline to be incorporated and have its headquarters in New Jersey. (People Express was based at Newark but was incorporated in Delaware.)
Newark Airport is also within easy driving range of one of the largest airline market in the country; it serves some 25 million passengers a year. While the airport is close to New York City, Kiwi estimates that 80 percent of its customers who originate their trips at Newark are New Jersey residents.
On most flights, Kiwi has two fares; there are as many as a dozen on other airlines' flights. The lowest price is for a restricted ticket requiring a round-trip purchase; the higher fare carries no limits. For example, the cheapest ticket on Kiwi to Chicago is $104 one way, with restrictions, and $119 unrestricted.
 
'They Like the Low Fares'
 Joyce Liebelt, a travel agent with VTS Travel Enterprises in Secaucus, said a number of her clients had been pleased with Kiwi. "They like the low fares," she said. "I haven't heard any raves about their service, but I haven't heard any complaints either."
Bill Mosley, a spokesman for the United States Department of Transportation in Washington, said the agency had no record of complaints against Kiwi. The agency releases statistics on complaints against a given airline only when there are more than five recorded in any one-month period.
Although comparisons with discount airlines like the ill-fated People Express are inevitable, Mr. Iverson pointed out that unlike his no-frills predecessors, Kiwi offered full meal and beverage service.
Kiwi's office could fairly be described as no-frills, however. The Newark-based reservations and management staff occupies part of a floor of the Hemisphere Center office building on Route 9 overlooking the airport. In a large room, desks are jammed next to each other, and private offices seem to be nonexistent.
Mr. Iverson works in a corner space; his daughter, Kelly, who works as his secretary, sits nearby. Reservations agents work in a smaller room down the hall.
A papier-mache kiwi bird, fashioned by a pilot who moonlights as an artist, greets visitors to the headquarters. With the staff ever mindful of the fate of so many similar airline ventures, this bit of self-deprecating humor seems to set the tone for the operation.
And although the airline has passed the one-year mark, employees still gather at their windows when a colleague shouts out, "Kiwi alert." It means one of their planes has been spotted in the skies above.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Q & A: John J. O'Brien;
Staying on Top of Newspaper Trends

BYLINE: By ARTHUR Z. KAMIN

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
JOHN J. O'BRIEN, the executive director of the New Jersey Press Association, has come a long way since his days of sweeping the floors in the press room at the weekly Hunterdon County Democrat in Flemington 28 years ago.
Though it seems odd now, he thought he had "reached the pinnacle" of his career when the paper quickly promoted him to Linotype operator in the composing room, setting news articles and advertisements in hot metal. 
 "I was happy," said Mr. O'Brien, 46. "But I knew, deep down, that Linotype wasn't going to be around too much longer. Times were starting to change."
He was right, of course. The line-casting machine became a relic as new technology slowly found its way into newspapers. Mr. O'Brien moved into other areas of the business -- circulation, editorial and advertising.
Late in 1975, he joined the Somerset Press newspapers in Somerville, where eventually he became publisher. Malcolm Forbes bought the operation in 1987 -- and two years later Mr. O'Brien was promoted to president of what became known as Forbes Newspapers.
For the last two years, he has headed the Trenton-based Press Association, founded in 1857, a trade organization of New Jersey's 20 daily and 105 weekly paid-circulation newspapers and 3 out-of-state affiliated members.
It has not been an entirely happy time. With the woeful state economy, the newspaper business has seen ad revenue decline even as the industry has been undergoing ever greater technological changes and sharp competition, often from sources other than rival newspapers. Mr. O'Brien has emerged as the state newspaper industry's chief spokesman.
"Sometimes I feel like a point man, a Green Beret," Mr. O'Brien said. "It's my job to move out to see what lies ahead and to cover our flanks at all times. It's not easy, but we're doing the job."
The association says it has already won a compromise victory by obtaining the establishment of ground rules for New Jersey Bell's participation in electronic publishing in the state.
The situation today makes Mr. O'Brien think often of that hulking Linotype -- and how newspapers must again change their ways not only to survive but to march into the next century.
That's one reason, he said, that the Press Association set up a "Future of Newspapering in New Jersey" committee, headed by E. Donald Lass, publisher and editor of The Asbury Park Press. And on the schedule for the association's annual convention last week in Cherry Hill were experts from all over the country with such topics as "The New Media Landscape," "Entering the Brave New World" and "Information Services on a Shoestring."
Despite the recession gloom, a new newspaper came on the scene on Sept. 24 -- the West Long Branch-based New Jersey Times, a tabloid weekly seeking a statewide circulation.
Mr. O'Brien lives in Kingwood Township with his wife, Chris. They have two grown children.
Though Mr. O'Brien's job involves frequent travel up and down the state, he tries to find time to ride motorcycles in the summer and snowmobiles in the winter -- and, as he puts it, to "recuperate from both in the spring and fall."
Q. The New Jersey economy continues to struggle. What does that mean for New Jersey newspapers in terms of advertising?
A. New Jersey is probably the most competitive newspaper market in America. Because 98 percent of the electronic media serving the state are based outside New Jersey, New Jersey newspapers are virtually the only providers of statewide and local news. Thus, intense readership occurs, and also intense competition for those readers. A down economy that affects ad budgets hits hard in this competitive climate.
Q. How about circulation? Is newspaper readership in the state on an upward or a downward trend?
A. I suspect there are as many or more people reading newspapers in New Jersey than there were 10 or 15 years ago. Our numbers have not kept pace with population growth, but remember, a large percent of our population does not read and speak English.
Q. How many daily newspapers were there in the state 10 years ago? How many are there today?
A. There are four fewer daily newspapers today than 10 years ago. Today's number stands at 20.
Q. Weekly newspapers? Is the total up or down?
A. There are more weekly newspapers than 10 years ago but fewer owners. A total of 105 paid circulation weeklies belong to our association.
Q. What is the circulation of your smallest member and your largest? Do they have very different needs and interests?
A. The Star-Ledger Sunday circulation is approximately 725,000. The weekly Vailsburg Leader serves about 300 households. There are more problems and obstacles that face large and small papers collectively than there are those that affect them individually. Things like First Amendment infringements, recycling issues and government regulations impact all New Jersey newspapers.
Q. There is a perception that the day of newspapers, as we know them today, may be coming to an end. Is there any truth to that?
A. Our industry is going through what I call "mediamorphosis." We're not dying. We're changing.
Q. We hear talk about electronic newspapers. What is the impact for New Jersey?
A. This change we're about to undergo is both exciting and frightening. The new media landscape is being created before our very eyes. Newspaper publishers must remember to protect their franchise as the electronic world develops. That franchise is news.
No one does news better than newspapers. All the other players out there -- cable companies, telephone companies, wireless companies -- are all building highways, but highways need traffic. We own the traffic.
Q. There's a perception that investigative journalism has become a casualty of the economy. Many newspapers do not seem to want to dig as deeply as they once did to get the story and to expose wrongdoing. Investigative journalism is costly and many newspapers do not want to offend readers. Is that true?
A. The lousy economy in New Jersey has claimed many victims. One of them has been editorial department budgets. To do true investigative pieces, you may have to commit one or two reporters for months. This is expensive.
But it is still going on, especially at the large newspapers. I don't think offending the readers enters into the equation. Offending advertisers might be a better question.
Q. Politicians like to get their stories into newspapers -- but when it comes time to advertise their election campaigns, they choose radio and television. Why?
A. I'm dumbfounded as to why anyone would spend $5 million on New York and Philadelphia TV when almost 70 percent of the people viewing the commercials can't vote in New Jersey.
The problem is the so-called "media advisers" are all ex-TV producers. They'll talk about gross rating points and frequency and impact. All nebulous terms. The real problem is that they are image builders. Politicians today worry about image -- not substance. Newspapers are media of substance.
Q. It appears that the day of the teen-age carrier, who delivered newspapers to your doorstep or sold them on the streets in all kinds of weather, is gone. What happened?
A. When I delivered The Newark News in 1957, I could save my pennies and buy a new pair of Keds after a few weeks. If a kid wants to buy $120 Nikes, he'll have to sell a lot of newspapers to make that purchase. Economics, coupled with papers switching to A.M. delivery, have pretty much cut kids out of the loop.
Q. What efforts are being made in New Jersey to get more minorities into journalism?
A. There are several excellent programs. Dow Jones has a national minorities program based in Princeton. Rider College runs an excellent Minorities Journalism Workshop each summer for high school journalists. We're not doing enough. Part of N.J.P.A.'s agenda is to do more.
Q. The New Jersey Press Association is also a lobbying organization, especially in dealing with the Governor and legislators. Is this a role you feel comfortable with?
A. Senator Alan Cranston said it best: "When it comes to lobbying -- take part or get taken apart." My responsibility at N.J.P.A. includes lobbying on the state level. With the average state legislator being exposed to 4,000 or more bills in a session, the only way they can possibly know the pros and cons of each is to rely on lobbyists to educate them.
My job is not the easiest in Trenton. While most lobbyists represent firms that contribute to legislators' war chests and wine and dine them, the businesses I represent write editorials telling them they are idiots. Then I lobby them. Not an advantageous position.
Q. What do you see as the biggest problem facing New Jersey newspapers today?
A. There are many problems: Government infringement, mandated recycling, changing reading habits. But by far the black cloud on the horizon is the way people are changing their buying habits.
Since 85 to 90 percent of a newspaper's revenue comes from advertising and that field may change dramatically in the coming years, there's cause for concern. Interactivity -- being able to bypass the traditional retailer and deal directly electronically with the manufacturer -- will change the face of marketing.

HEADLINE: Choosing Sides In the Way We Shop

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
IN Westchester, where crowds of savvy consumers have increasingly been drawn to a growing lineup of sleek regional discount stores along the highways, some shoppers still hew to the old ways, saying they prefer the quiet, albeit dowdier, aisles of their local Woolworth store.
"Coming here is a lot like coming home," said Adele Piacquadio, a 72-year-old resident of the Bronx who was buying a lampshade at the Woolworth store in Eastchester recently. "Maybe it's force of habit, but I grew up with Woolworth, and I like growing old with it." 
 But Woolworth's sales receipts earlier this year showed that the American retail icon founded more than 100 years ago was not growing old gracefully. In the second quarter of this year, net income was $2 million compared with net income of $33 million in the same period last year. Revenues, however, for the second quarter actually increased slightly, to $2.28 billion from $2.23 billion. An overall increase in the number of stores, coupled with lower-than-planned revenues, resulted in higher inventory and debt levels.
Despite the many shoppers who remain loyal to the chain, even in the face of mounting competition from discounters, the Manhattan-based Woolworth Corporation earlier this month announced that in the United States it would shutter 400, or about half, of its variety stores, along with 330, or about a third, of its Kinney and Footquarters shoe stores.
The company said that in both the United States and Canada, the 970 general merchandising and specialty stores that are to close represent $36 million in operating losses for the first half of 1993. .
Three of Westchester's nine Woolworths -- in Bronxville, Ossining and Tarrytown -- are among those to be shut. Two Woolworth stores at the Cross County Mall in Yonkers, another in that city on South Broadway, the Eastchester Woolworth on Post Road, the company's White Plains store on Mamaroneck Avenue and its Peekskill store on East Main Street will stay open, the company said.
"The continuation of unfavorable economic conditions in the United States and Canada, along with competitive pressures affecting customers' shopping habits and the generally depressed consumer-spending environment, have led us to accelerate our store closings," said William K. Lavin, Woolworth's chairman and chief executive officer. In an earlier interview he said that third-quarter earnings were expected to fall sharply from last year's figure.
Woolworth's decline may reflect the end of one merchandising era, but it is taking place as another retail trend is on the rise. In Westchester, along with other communities across the country, deep discounters are gaining a strong foothold despite -- and possibly because of -- the hard economic times. The discounters, including so-called big-box retailers -- like Tops Appliance City, which sell goods from warehouse-like stores, are playing to recession-weary consumers who want the best buy for their dollar.
 
County Is Now Affordable
 What is different in Westchester is that the discount trend has taken hold here somewhat later than it did in the rest of the country, said Noreen L. Preston, an economist for the County Office of Economic Development. Now that real estate prices and interest rates have dropped, discount retailers are finally able to afford outlets in a county that heretofore has been known for its high-priced land, she said.
"The discounters up to now have been slow to come here, especially the big-box retailers who tend to be stand-alones that require huge amounts of land for parking spaces," Ms. Preston said.
Joseph E. Phelan, budget director for the county, said that while he was "sorry to see some Woolworths go," the influx of the deep-discount retailers was good news for Westchester sales revenues.
"This kind of business can do nothing but good for us," Mr. Phelan said, adding that the county would likely exceed its original projection of $170 million in sales-tax revenues this year because of the discount stores.
Keith Foxe, a researcher for the International Council of Shopping Centers in Manhattan, called Westchester, with its high per capita income and high density per square mile, "under-stored compared to other areas in big markets."
 
Looking for Amenities
 The Office of Economic Development recently reported that since the third quarter of last year, six major discounters have opened new outlets in Westchester: Barnes & Noble in Hartsdale, Bradlees in Yonkers, the Pace Membership Warehouse in Elmsford, T. J. Maxx in Yorktown Heights, Tops Appliance City in Hawthorne and World of Interior Design in White Plains. Even more discounters are expected to move into the county next year, including the Home Depot, a home-improvement chain.
Discount-hungry consumers may want rock-bottom prices, but market research has shown that they also look for amenities like food courts, bright lighting and easy-to-navigate shopping areas, said Coleman F. Nee, a spokesman for Bradlees (based in Braintree, Mass.), which opened its first Westchester store earlier this year on Central Park Avenue in Yonkers.
Bradlees, a $1.8 billion-a-year general merchandiser with 126 stores in eight states, also plans to open a 125,000-square-foot store in New Rochelle next year.
At the new 207,000 square-foot, three-story Bradlees in Yonkers, the site of a former Alexander's, the decor is super modern and user friendly -- with wide aisles, bright lighting, pristine white-tile floors and comfortable areas of gray carpeting.
"We went for broke with this store," said Roy Polayes, the manager, pointing to neatly defined retail areas within the store and bulging racks of clothing with both brand-name and private-label merchandise. "We have a great selection and all price points -- good, better, best, you name it."
 
Like Hot Dogs and Apple Pie
 By contrast, at the 30-year-old Woolworth in Eastchester, boxes of laundry detergent were stacked haphazardly next to framed Snow White posters, and the stock along the narrow aisles was depleted in many sections of the store. But at the checkout counter, Denise Shanahan, a clerk, said the store's appearance did not seem to keep customers away.
"People still keep saying, 'Thank God, you're not closing,' " Ms. Shanahan said.
One couple shopping at the store, Dominic and Ceil Berardi of Eastchester, said that so long as Woolworth stayed open, they would remain loyal. "This place is like hot dogs and apple pie," said Mr. Berardi, who is 65. "It's American, and we love it."
But Mr. Polayes said Bradlees was an all-American store too, combining the best of both worlds. He called it "the 90's equivalent" of the old-fashioned variety store.
"Only instead of hot dogs, it's tacos and pizza in our food court," he said. "And instead of apple pie, it's bagels and croissants. We may be big, but we are also warm and friendly."
In Hawthorne, Tops Appliance City, a chain that sells a broad range of appliances and consumer electronics, based in Edison, N.J., recently opened what it calls a megastore -- a 65,000-square-foot outlet larger than the usual 30,000- to 40,000-square-foot superstore, said Philip Schoonover, the company's executive vice president.
 
'Demographics Were Right'
 The Hawthorne store is the first in Westchester for Tops Appliance City, a $400 million-a-year retailer with seven outlets. The company's research studies showed that Westchester was understored and ripe for development of discount retailing, Mr. Schoonover said.
"The demographics were right," he said. "We look for an average household income of $57,000, a family size of four and a head of household who is about 37 years old."
The pricing is deep discount and aims for high sales volumes for every square foot of selling space -- "a formula that seems to thrive in tough economic times," Mr. Schoonover said.
But all is not bare bones inside the store, where the atmosphere is bright, with high ceilings and spacious aisles. A model of a pink Cadillac is suspended above the car-stereo section, "like the Hard Rock Cafe," Mr. Schoonover said.
Although consumers and the county's budget director welcomed the large discounters, some residents and small-business owners said there was a negative side to all of the growth. In Port Chester and Yonkers, where Home Depot hopes to locate two of its first three Westchester stores, opposition to those plans has been fierce. The $7 billion retailer, based in Atlanta, has more than 230 stores in 21 states, said Nell B. Parker, a spokeswoman for the company.
Joseph Chira, chairman of the Rye Citizens Committee, a public interest group, said that big so-called magnet discounters, which draw from a broad marketing area, often have a negative impact on nearby residential areas because the stores attract more traffic to side streets than the streets were designed to handle.
Port Chester has approved the Home Depot's application to build where an office complex stands, close to major highways. But Mr. Chira's group has filed two lawsuits in State Supreme Court in White Plains, claiming that Port Chester's Planning Commission did not conduct the proper environmental impact studies, among other things. Also the City of Rye has sued Port Chester, claiming that rezoning to accommodate the discounter could result in unsafe traffic conditions on nearby streets in Rye.
 
'It's All a Lot of Hype'
 In Yonkers, Herbert Lockwood, president of Citizens, Businesses and Labor for Better Planning in Westchester and the owner of Lockwood Building Supply and Home Center on the Saw Mill River Road in Yonkers, said his organization opposed city-approved plans for a Home Depot, a Walmart and other discounters on Austin Avenue.
Mr. Lockwood said his group is concerned that there may be hazardous wastes in the ground from a former dump and that fumes like methane gas might leak into the stores; he also questioned the discounters' claims that they will generate new jobs and tax revenues.
"They will only take away from existing businesses, but it won't mean more for the city in the long run. It's all a lot of hype," Mr. Lockwood said.
In addition to the Port Chester and Yonkers stores, the Home Depot also plans to put a store in New Rochelle.
The Office of Economic Development had some survival suggestions for small businesses that will be threatened by the discounters. Ms. Preston recommended that owners try to "fill in the gaps" that big discounters sometimes overlook. She said they should emphasize service and offer specialty or unusual goods that the discounters do not carry.
"But no matter what," Ms. Preston said, "it's going to be a tough time ahead for them."

HEADLINE: County To Buy Mt. Vernon Stadium

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON

 BODY:
UNDER a plan developed by Mayor Ronald A. Blackwood of Mount Vernon and County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, this city's aging Memorial Field Stadium will be renovated and made available for both countywide and local sporting and entertainment events by the spring of 1996.
The county has agreed to purchase the rundown stadium -- built in 1930 -- along with the adjoining field and to spend $6 million to refurbish the six-acre site, Mr. O'Rourke said. When completed, it will be the largest and most modern sports stadium in the county. 
 The County Executive also explained that acquisition of the field coincides with plans to build a major retail development across the street from the stadium on Sanford Boulevard. Halpern Enterprises in Tarrytown is negotiating to raze three buildings there and build a new structure that would house a major discount retailer. The developer is also planning parking for up to 700 cars.
Mount Vernon's comptroller, Peter P. Pucillo, called the Sandford Boulevard corridor "ripe for development." In addition to the developer's plan, the United States Postal Service is moving a nearby distribution center to Harrison in two years, and that site could become available for commercial development, the comptroller said.
 
Appraisal Awaited
 Under the agreement, the county will build a state-of-the-art graded and artificially surfaced competitive playing field for soccer, football, baseball and field hockey at Memorial Stadium. And it will refurbish the existing 3,900-seat concrete bleachers and build a grandstand to accommodate 6,000 spectators.
Also, the locker rooms, restrooms and electrical systems at the stadium are to be renovated.
The county's purchase price has yet to be decided, subject to an appraisal of the property. Once ownership is transferred from the city to the county, the county's Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation will oversee activities there. Existing tennis courts adjacent to the field will remain under the jurisdiction of the city.
Under the agreement, yearly Mount Vernon events are to be given preference in scheduling by the County Parks Department, and local residents who use the field for recreational purposes like jogging will be able to continue to do so.
 
A Saving in Operating Expenses
 Also under the agreement, the city has the option to buy back the field.
Mr. Pucillo said that budget problems kept Mount Vernon from tackling the renovations on its own.
"We have too many other pressing needs, and we have to keep cutting back and cutting back," he said. "We barely have enough money to pay for police and fire protection."
He said the city had a major tax increase this year "just to pay for basic services, and we certainly couldn't do that again for this."
In addition to saving up to $100,000 in yearly operating expenses, the city will receive a percentage of sales-tax revenues from concessions and tickets, said Constance G. Post, the city's Commissioner of Planning and Community Development.
 
'Brand New Money'
 She said that several factors -- including the continued deterioration of the stadium, the county's ongoing interest in the property over several years and plans to develop the large shopping area across the street -- had influenced the city's decision to move ahead on the deal.
The commissioner said there would be an initial injection of cash from the sale of the stadium and more money later from attendance at stadium events.
"We're not talking about recycled money, that moves from one side of town to the other," she said. "We're talking about brand new money from people who don't usually come to Mount Vernon but who will visit now and also shop across the street. It's going to be an economic shot in the arm for us."

HEADLINE: A Long Road on Affordable Housing

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
A RECENT proposal to build two five-unit apartment buildings for homeless families on a residential stretch of the Post Road here drew protests from some members of neighborhood associations a few weeks ago and highlighted the tensions surrounding the issue of affordable housing in the county.
These units were proposed by the nonprofit housing organization known as Shore -- the acronym stands for Sheltering Homeless Is Our Responsibility -- and were targeted for homeless families or others who qualified. 
 Jane Perkinson, chairwoman of the permanent housing committee of Shore, said: "The state-of-emergency housing has improved in the county, with a number of good facilities during the past four or five years as people have become more aware of the problem. The hitch is that the supply of permanent housing isn't there, and that is a major need. And each time it dwindles, it isn't replaced."
Susan Case, a resident of the Prospect Park section of White Plains where the proposed apartments would be built, said: "There is a sense that nobody wants things in their backyard, but I think we have a real responsibility to pay attention to the problems of society and not block these efforts. I understand the fears, that people hear the word 'homeless' and hear something different from what I hear. But I think Shore is very impressive, very responsible and very sensitive to neighborhood needs. They screen their tenants carefully."
 
Commuting Is an Alternative
 Despite the common perception that Westchester is an enclave of affluent single-family homes on one-acre lots, the reality is that even many county employees can't afford to live here -- nor can many who were reared here continue to live in the same communities with their families, unless they share housing. According to 1990 housing data, the latest figures available, 14,116 county residents were living in overcrowded conditions.
The Shore program is similar to, but not the same as, a county plan for affordable housing put forth by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke and yet to be adopted by the County Board of Legislators. As a step toward possible acceptance of the plan, a report on "Affordable Housing Allocation Plan" for Westchester County was adopted unanimously on July 15 by the county's Housing Implementation Commission and presented to the Board.
The report is being studied by urban planners at the Rutgers University Center for Urban Policy Research in New Brunswick, N.J. It outlines the housing needs of families living or working in Westchester and having incomes from $29,431 to the median county income of $58,862. Some of the proposed housing will have units that can be rented, and in those cases the proposed rental range is $600 to $1,000 a month.
With rentals frequently expensive and hard to come by and purchase prices beyond the budget of most working people, municipal workers, county staff members, teachers and hospital workers often commute from Rockland or Putnam Counties, and many retirees, unless they live in houses with paid-up mortgages, are unable to remain in the communities in which they have spent most of their lives. Even some retirees with paid-up mortgages are forced to move because of high taxes or other high costs of living.
 
Court Action Remains a Threat
 After Mr. O'Rourke proposed building 5,000 affordable housing units in the county over a 10-year period, he appointed the Housing Implementation Commission. It consists of 22 advocates of affordable housing, who were charged with assessing the need for permanent housing as well as providing voluntary guidelines to help municipalities respond to court pressure. The commission suggested that housing be distributed according to a municipality's population, individual household income, existence of overcrowded housing and usable municipal land for housing projects.
George M. Raymond, chairman of the Housing Implementation Commission, said: "The county won't go into any municipality against its wishes. There is no compulsion in this concept. These are just guidelines. There is a strong need to provide affordable housing for young people who are just getting started, senior citizens whose income is insufficient to afford housing and all the workers -- janitors, waitresses, municipal workers, single parents -- who need places to live.
"The court has ruled in 1977 that a municipality has a responsibility to meet its share of regional needs for affordable housing, as does the 1990 case against North Salem. If municipalities don't do this voluntarily, then the courts can charge them. There is a real judicial threat to municipal independence. The process is slow, but I hope it will be recognized as the right way to go."

Eavesdropping on Hitler's Scientists

OPERATION EPSILON
The Farm Hall Transcripts.
Introduction by Sir Charles Frank.
Illustrated. 313 pp. Berkeley:
University of California Press. $30. 
 "THE moment we are no longer dangerous we are also no longer interesting," Carl Friedrich von Weizsacker observed ruefully to Werner Heisenberg upon learning that the United States had exploded a nuclear weapon over Japan. Heisenberg, the discoverer of the uncertainty principle and a winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, and his colleague, a son of Baron Ernst von Weizsacker, Hitler's deputy foreign minister, were among 10 German scientists interned -- and clandestinely wiretapped -- at the end of World War II at Farm Hall, a secluded estate in England. The captured scientists had supposed that their expertise would be needed by the Americans and the British. Their wartime work on nuclear energy, after all, had been the obvious reason for their capture by an Allied raiding party behind enemy lines and their confinement. But suddenly it was clear that the German scientific team had little to teach its captors. "These fellows have succeeded in separating isotopes," exclaimed one of the startled and annoyed Germans. "What is there left for us to do?"
How men as proud as Heisenberg and von Weizsacker dealt with the realization that they were bit players rather than stars in the great tragedy of nuclear weaponry -- military resources to be isolated from the Soviets rather than intellectual capital needed by the West -- is one of many compelling themes in what have come to be known as the Farm Hall transcripts. These English translations of selected conversations recorded over a period of six months were made in 1945 by British intelligence agents. The transcripts have been the subject of extensive speculation since their existence was acknowledged 31 years ago. Declassified only in 1992, they have now been published under the title "Operation Epsilon" (the original code name for this extraordinary eavesdropping project), with an introduction by Sir Charles Frank, a physicist who had known most of these German scientists and who was a member of the British intelligence team working on the Farm Hall project.
Speculation about these transcripts had focused on the character and scope of Germany's nuclear energy program: How much of the relevant science did the Germans understand? How hard did they work to produce a bomb? To what extent did their failure result from moral qualms? The transcripts do illuminate these issues, but largely by confirming conclusions already reached by historians of science, and the real significance of the transcripts lies elsewhere.
None of the German scientists, including Heisenberg, understood exactly how a bomb would work. Most had applied themselves diligently to the building of a reactor, although within a program to which only limited resources had been committed on account of the German assumption that the war would be over before a nuclear weapon could be built. This assumption, and attendant judgments about military efficiency, constrained the German nuclear program more than did the qualms a few of the scientists apparently did feel about helping Hitler get a superweapon.
To read "Operation Epsilon" with only these questions in mind, however, is to miss much of its value. Here is a cohort of some of the era's finest scientists, who had chosen to remain in the service of one of history's most iniquitous regimes. We observe them in private discourse about themselves and about some of the most portentous events of the age, including the dropping on a civilian population of an explosive of the sort they, themselves, might conceivably have made, but did not.
"Operation Epsilon" enables us to watch at least four spontaneous dramas taking place simultaneously, with the same cast. One demonstrates the social-psychological trauma of constructing a meaning for the German failure to build an atomic bomb. Another is the political and professional scramble to identify the interests of German science in the postwar world and to develop a coherent strategy for advancing those interests in relation to the British and American rivalry with the Soviet Union. A third is the jockeying for position in the new, de-Nazified scientific community of postwar Germany. A fourth is the moral renegotiation of each scientist's relation with Nazism.
If the drama of deflation and confusion in the wake of the American nuclear success is the most obvious and accessible of these dramas, the reconfiguration of the external and internal politics of the German scientific community will be of the most interest to students of the political sociology of science. Heisenberg and von Weizsacker were especially calculating about the need of the Germans to replace Third Reich politics with cold war politics. They favored the resumption of open scientific communication partly because they feared that if the Americans and the British continued the secrecy adopted during the war, Germans would be frozen out of the most interesting science. Heisenberg actually tried to negotiate with British scientists who visited Farm Hall, threatening, in effect, to defect to the Soviet Union if the British and the Americans did not guarantee the Germans control over their various institutes in Germany and sufficient capitalization to enable them to operate at a pace comparable to that of leading American laboratories. When a colleague warned that such cooperation with Germany's victorious enemies might get the scientists in trouble at home, Heisenberg explained that it would be done "cleverly," making it appear to "the masses" that scientists were working "with fury and gnashing of teeth" under "the wicked Anglo-Saxon control."
At the level of the German scientific community's internal politics, we can observe a host of professional jealousies and personal conflicts, voiced in one-on-one confidences. Max von Laue, who had won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914, was a nice guy but a hopelessly incompetent administrator; the physicist Karl Wirtz was seen as insufferably vain but as someone who always got things done; von Weizsacker made slaves of his underlings and was comically slow at simple calculations. In these unguarded conversations, Heisenberg himself comes across as formidable not only in his technical prowess, but also in his abilities as a political strategist. Whatever we may conclude about Heisenberg's soul, he was surely a man of parts, capable of great deception and of persuading those around him to say and do what he wished. At Farm Hall, there was no doubt about who was in charge.
"Operation Epsilon" is a magnificent source for the study of how German intellectuals dealt with Nazism. Two German physicists at Farm Hall, who had been party members, Kurt Diebner and Erich Bagge, felt very much on the defensive and sought desperately to win the confidence of their colleagues. Diebner tried to ingratiate himself with the revered Otto Hahn, the co-discoverer of nuclear fission (his Nobel Prize in Chemistry was announced while he was at Farm Hall), by stressing the opportunism of his decision to join the party. Diebner claimed to have made a deal with the non-Nazi Karl Wirtz: if the Nazis won, Diebner would help Wirtz; if they lost, Wirtz would help Diebner. Whatever these men may have felt in 1941 or 1942, by the summer of 1945 they shared, even in private, a sense that the Nazi regime had been a colossal nuisance to science. Although the transcripts contain a handful of direct references to Nazi atrocities, Nazism figures in these pages more as an inconvenience than a crime.
That the listeners were alert for signs of remorse is apparent from the cover letters sent by the translators to British intelligence. These letters call attention to a rare remark about the wanton murder of Jews and Poles, and to a reference made to the killing of the parents of Samuel A. Goudsmit, the Dutch-born American physicist who had in fact headed the intelligence mission that selected "the Farm Hall 10" for internment. These men brooded little about Hitler's atrocities, and about their own complicity in them. What instead exercised Erich Bagge, for example, was the fate of Germans at the mercy of occupying Moroccan troops brought into Germany by the hated French.
Throughout all of these interlocking dramas, members of the cast were overwhelmingly defined by two identities. They were "scientists," and they were "Germans." Neither, they imagined, had anything to do with politics. The news from Hiroshima brought out these personas vividly. Their pride as scientists and their patriotism as Germans made all of them deeply ashamed not to have built an atomic bomb during the war, even though several of them expressed contradictory relief that they had not done so. With the exception of the legendary anti-Nazi von Laue, these men were so thoroughly caught up in their technical roles as scientists and in their nationality as Germans that they reflected very little on the distinctive politics of the regime they had served. This was true even of those who had been party members. The Farm Hall 10, four of whom are still alive, were good scientific soldiers, largely oblivious to the consequences of their professionalism and their nationalism.

 BODY:
The writers and revolutionaries who gave Greenwich Village its reputation for bohemianism at the beginning of the century were reformers at heart. Their mission was to make a better world, not better art. As John Reed put it, "This class struggle plays hell with your poetry." They found a haven in the Village, a backwater unaffected by the grid system imposed by city planners on the rest of New York. GREENWICH VILLAGE: Culture and Counterculture (Museum of the City of New York/Rutgers University, $29.95), a fine collection of essays and photographs edited by Rick Beard, a former official of the Museum of the City of New York, and Leslie Cohen Berlowitz, director of the Humanities Council of New York University, examines the peculiar confluence of geography and economics that made the American bohemians feel at home. For example, few thoroughfares linked the Village with the business district to the south or with the flourishing shopping district just north; this preserved the neighborhood's intimate quality. As the essayists -- who include Alfred Kazin, Daniel Aaron and Denis Donoghue -- point out, the anonymous rooming houses and studios offered liberation from conventional restraints. Still, personal relations took a back seat to politics. Village residents expressed outrage at the needless deaths in the Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire and were early supporters of the suffragettes. After World War I, many of the original Villagers moved on, the artistic types were shrewd entrepreneurs playing to an increasing tourist trade, and the neighborhood's character remained; the Beat Generation writers of the 1950's hung out in the Village for the same reasons John Reed and Emma Goldman had 40 years earlier. The rapture was fading, but the memory is wonderfully preserved in this book.
