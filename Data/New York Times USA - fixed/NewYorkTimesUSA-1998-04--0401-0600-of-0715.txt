HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Rally in Treasury Market Ends As Price of 30-Year Bond Slips

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
A three-day rally in the Treasury market ran out of steam yesterday as traders took profits.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 2/32, to 103 17/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, closed at 5.87 percent, unchanged from Thursday. A week ago, the yield was at 5.88 percent. 
 With yields already at low levels, market participants are showing reluctance to buy Treasury securities without strong evidence that the economy is indeed slowing and inflation is not a threat. The lowest point the yield of the long bond has reached this year was 5.66 percent in January, when expectations were running high that the Asian slowdown would reduce the demand for exports from the United States, thus placing a drag on growth here and snuffing out inflation pressures.
Indeed, bond prices received some support from a report that showed the United States trade deficit widened to $12.1 billion in February.
Bonds got a further lift after the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production in March rose two-tenths of 1 percent. Analysts had expected production to be unchanged in March. But the Fed revised its data for January and February to show output had declined two-tenths of 1 percent in each month.
"Further confirmation of a declining path of economic growth was seen in the industrial production report that indicated some head winds could soon emanate from the manufacturing sector," said Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors.
The moderating effects of yesterday's trade deficit report will likely have to hold investors for quite a while, since next week's economic calendar is sparse. Sherry Cooper, chief economist for Nesbitt Burns Securities, said: "The steady deterioration in the trade deficit will take some of the heat off the Federal Reserve, and at its current pace, the widening trade deficit could reduce 1998 G.D.P. growth by as much as 1.5 percentage points.
"This would provide an offset to continued strong domestic demand growth and tight labor markets."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Bank Merger Fever Spreads To Canada

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 17

 BODY:
Two more of Canada's largest banks announced plans today to merge, compressing the country's already highly concentrated financial services industry to just four large national banks and raising concerns about competition.
The proposed $15.9 billion (United States) merger between the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the Toronto-Dominion Bank would create an institution with more than $320 billion (United States) in assets and 2,300 branches across Canada. The deal would also reach into the United States, where Toronto-Dominion owns Waterhouse Securities, a discount brokerage firm, and Waterhouse Bank, while Canadian Imperial owns CIBC Oppenheimer, a full-service securities firm. 
 The deal comes after two weeks of huge bank deals in the United States and less than three months after the Royal Bank of Canada and the Bank of Montreal announced plans to join and create Canada's largest bank, with assets of about $333 billion (United States).
Indeed, the leaders of CIBC and Toronto-Dominion said this morning that their decision to merge was strongly influenced by the rapid consolidation of banks in the United States and Canada.
"We made this decision in the midst of some of the most profound and turbulent changes in the history of our industry," said A. L. Flood, the chairman and chief executive of CIBC.
The new bank -- which will be named CIBC -- will have a market capitalization of $30.2 billion (United States), making it Canada's second-largest bank and one of the 10 largest in North America.
Government regulators, however, have said they will not allow the banks' aggressive actions to bully them into approving the mergers. Consumers and small-business owners worry competition will be stifled if there are only four big banks.
Shares of CIBC and Toronto-Dominion fell today on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Shares of Toronto-Dominion fell $4 (Canadian), to $69 (Canadian), and CIBC fell $3.10 (Canadian), to $55 (Canadian).
Both banks are considered well run and innovative, and they have recently expanded into new fields. CIBC was the first Canadian bank to sell its own auto, property and life insurance policies through a subsidiary. Toronto-Dominion is an important player in the discount brokerage business.
Mr. Flood said he first discussed a possible merger with A. Charles Baille, the chairman of Toronto-Dominion Bank, during a telephone call on Jan. 23, hours after the proposed merger between the Bank of Montreal and Royal Bank of Canada was announced.
The two remaining large Canadian banks, the Bank of Nova Scotia and the National Bank of Canada, have not announced any plans to merge, but analysts are not ruling out further consolidation.
These rapid changes in Canadian banking come after decades of stability.
Last year, Mr. Baille openly opposed bank mergers, saying that "size is not a strategy, but a statistic." But the recent wave of mergers, including the mammoth deal between Citicorp and Travelers Group, have changed his mind.
"In a world of increasing consolidation," Mr. Baille said today, "size can arguably be an important defense."
But in Canada, laws would have to be changed before the bank mergers could proceed. And the message from Canadian regulators today was that nothing should be taken for granted.
"The No. 1 concern of the Government remains what is good for Canadians and the Canadian economy," Canada's Finance Minister, Paul Martin, said in a statement today.
Canadian regulators have long opposed big banks and have imposed regulations prohibiting any individual person or entity from owning more than 10 percent of a bank. A Task Force on the Future of the Canadian Financial Services Sector is now considering changes to those laws.
But the Government will not allow any merger to proceed until the task force issues its report, sometime in September, Mr. Martin said.
"International scope and size cannot be the only criteria for our decisions on the evolution of Canada's financial sector," he said. "Strong domestic competition is also a fundamental principle we support."
Under the terms of the announced merger, CIBC shareholders will receive a one-for-one exchange for the new merged bank stock. Because speculation has forced up the value of Toronto-Dominion stock more than 50 percent since January, its shareholders will receive 1.3 shares in the new bank for each Toronto-Dominion share held.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
G.M. Earnings Hint at Trouble Later This Year

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 17

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation worried Wall Street today by reporting first-quarter earnings that suggested underlying weaknesses in the company's prospects later this year.
While General Motors' bottom line benefited from cost-cutting worth $1.2 billion in the first quarter, and from selling a greater percentage of high-profit sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks, earnings suffered from a sharp increase in rebates and other incentives offered to improve the company's sluggish sales. Those marketing costs rose 51.7 percent, to an average of $1,305 a vehicle sold in the first quarter, up from $860 in the first quarter of last year. 
 "Essentially, they are treading water," said Maryann N. Keller, an auto analyst with Furman Selz L.L.C., a New York investment banking and brokerage firm. "What they save in one place, they spend in another."
Other analysts said they had lost confidence that General Motors' future earnings would live up to Wall Street's expectations -- the consensus among analysts is that G.M. will earn $8.11 a share for the year, up from the $7.90 it earned last year.
"There is a question of whether G.M. will make its earnings estimates this year," said Jack V. Kirnan, an auto analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, who estimates the company will earn just $7.75 a share for the year.
J. Michael Losh, G.M.'s chief financial officer, did little to assuage Wall Street's concerns. He refused today to tell analysts whether he was comfortable with their earnings estimates for the year. "We're confident as we look forward to 1998 that we're going to have another good year," was all Mr. Losh would say.
For the first quarter, General Motors earned $1.6 billion, or $2.27 a fully diluted share, down 10.7 percent from $1.796 billion, or $2.28 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. When the results are adjusted to reflect the company's spinoff in December of its giant Hughes military business and the resulting addition of Delco Electronics to the Delphi business unit, the company earned $1.7 billion, or $2.21 a share, in the 1997 quarter.
Revenue, when adjusted for the spinoff, rose 2.6 percent, to $41.6 billion.
The consensus among analysts was that G.M. would earn $2.25 a share, according to the First Call Corporation, the Boston-based investment research network.
While the earnings exceeded expectations, shares of General Motors fell $1.1875, to $68.9375. Some analysts said the company's earnings generated worries that the auto industry would begin a bitter price war, dragging down stock prices for the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation today as a result. Ford stock fell 87.5 cents, to $48.8125, while Chrysler stock fell 50 cents, to $43.6875.
"People are concerned that there is going to be a bloodbath in marketing costs," Mr. Kirnan of Salmon Smith Barney said. Many are worried that "the marketing costs are going to continue to eat up the vast amount of the cost cuts," he said. Even if G.M. earns as much as analysts expect, he said, the company will be likely to do so because it has bought back more of its stock, not because it has improved its core business dramatically.
In the first quarter, G.M. spent $1.6 billion buying about 24 million shares of its common stock, and it has announced plans to buy an additional $3.68 billion. Since January of last year, the company has bought back a total of $5.3 billion, amounting to about 12 percent of G.M.'s stock.
"That's why people are buying the stock now -- not because they have great expectations for growth in the automotive business, but because they expect the company to return excess cash through buybacks," said John A. Casesa, an auto analyst with Schroder & Company. "Operationally, they're running in place."
The company's largest unit posted an earnings increase of 8.1 percent. G.M.'s North American operations earned $826 million, up from $764 million in the first quarter of last year -- its best-ever quarter. Its net profit margin edged up to 3.2 percent in the first quarter from 3.1 percent the year before, still short of the company's 5 percent goal.
"Our continued aggressive cost-cutting initiatives and increased sales of higher-profit trucks drove improvements" in the North American business, said John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive. The company is on track to meet its goal of cutting $4 billion in costs this year companywide, he said.
Profits from G.M.'s international operations were hurt by the economic slump in Asia and the difficult economic environment in South America. Profits fell 38.9 percent, to $160 million in the first quarter from $262 million in the period a year earlier. Profit margins fell to 2.0 percent from 3.2 percent a year earlier.
The company's newly formed Hughes Electronics Corporation saw its income more than double from the first quarter of last year. Hughes contributed $54 million to G.M.'s profits, up from $24 million the year before.
 
Cut for Chrysler's Chief
DETROIT, April 17 (Bloomberg News) -- The Chrysler Corporation awarded its chairman, Robert J. Eaton, a 1997 compensation package valued at $11.17 million, down about 14.2 percent from what he made a year earlier.
Mr. Eaton's cash bonus slid to $3 million in 1997 from $4.5 million the previous year, according to a proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. His salary rose to $1.61 million from $1.44 million in 1996. Altogether, Mr. Eaton's 1996 pay package had totaled just over $13 million.
The pay cut for 1997 came amid lower earnings at Chrysler, the only major vehicle manufacturer based in the United States to report a drop in net income for 1997.

HEADLINE: Leftist Scholars Look Right At Last, And Find A History

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN 

 BODY:
Since postwar leftist radicalism peaked in 1968, conservatives have affixed Ronald Reagan's name to a revolution, the South has deserted the Democrats for the Republicans, the Christian right has pushed its way onto the national stage, and liberal confidence in government action has become about as commonplace as the rotary phone.
Yet historians have all but ignored modern American conservatism. Its founding thinkers like Richard Weaver and Russell Kirk have rarely been read on college campuses; its adherents, from prowar students in the 60's to anti-union women, have been overlooked or dismissed as kooks; its religious underpinnings have been belittled. 
 "Twentieth century American conservatism has been something of an orphan in historical scholarship," Alan Brinkley, a liberal historian, has declared.
The orphan has finally been adopted. The parentage, however, may come as a surprise: many of the researchers are not conservatives but liberals. And they are using the techniques of social history, an approach that has most frequently been applied to the left and viewed with suspicion by the right.
By marrying social and political history, this new wave of scholarship is revising the history of Americans on the right -- their resolute devotion to particular issues and their success in compelling the political machinery to respond. And it is spelling out how a set of ideas that was soundly repudiated 35 years ago is today front and center in American life.
The most glaring absence from the conservative story has been "pots and pans" history, which looks at the everyday lives of ordinary people, from young organizers to activist housewives, from religious-minded business entrepreneurs to isolationists. Compared with books on union organizers, slaves or Populist farmers, works on conservatives have lacked empathy and rich detail, says Michael Kazin, a self-described leftist historian at American University.
Now "what we're discovering is that there's not just an intellectual conservative history, but a popular conservative tradition," Mr. Kazin says. "That's what new about the scholarship."
Liberal historians are discovering that characterizations of conservatives as either narrowly self-interested or extremists were crudely drawn. Many add that they have developed a deeper understanding of conservative concerns or sensitivity to them, even though they still reject them. One result is a more rounded picture of a variety of people who often don't share more than their hostility to liberalism: cold war anti-Communists, economic libertarians, neoconservatives and traditionalists (the Catholic intellectuals and grass-roots fundamentalists who believe God and moral values should be pre-eminent in society).
The common enemy that brought these divergent groups together was Communism, says Lisa McGirr, a liberal and an assistant professor at Harvard who is writing the first social history of the right in Orange County, California, in the 1960's. After initially organizing in Orange County school districts against the "red menace," mothers, dentists, businessmen and arms industry engineers exchanged newsletters and books like "The Naked Communist" that warned of the Communist danger. They met to watch anti-Communist films in lodge halls and churches, which were becoming important community centers for these new residents. Some thousands joined the state's John Birch Society, seen as one of the few vehicles for opposing the "liberal Leviathan," Ms. McGirr says. "There is a real anti-statism on the right," she adds. "I don't think it's correct to argue that 'local control' is simply a code word for bigots." The conspiracy-minded racist rantings of its leaders eventually led to the John Birch Society's decline in the second half of the decade, but onetime members refocused their attention on issues like sex education, abortion and pornography. "Let the dishwashing wait," said one housewife, to safeguard "freedom for our children." These former John Birchers and a broad range of other conservatives found a champion for their concerns about morality, race and law and order in the 1966 nominee for California Governor, Ronald Reagan.
John A. Andrew, a liberal historian who published "The Other Side of the 60's" (Rutgers) last year, a book about the Young Americans for Freedom, declares "the right was just as radical" as the left in the 60's.
There was a difference between the two, however: The Young Americans, founded in 1960 after conservatives became disillusioned with Richard M. Nixon and the liberal bent of the Republican Party, learned how to recruit their own candidates and run campaigns; the left-wing Students for a Democratic Society never did. Mr. Andrew adds that the Kennedy Administration was so worried about the right's popular appeal that it started the Ideological Organizations Project in 1961, which included White House monitoring of right-wing organizations and illegal tax audits.
Contrary to the accepted story line, Mr. Andrew says, Barry Goldwater's smashing 1964 defeat was not dispiriting to these young conservatives. In fact, it inspired the political organizing that eventually put Mr. Reagan in the Oval Office.
Mary Brennan, a liberal historian who wrote about the Goldwater coalition in "Turning Right in the 60's" (1995), is now examining the role of conservative women in the anti-Communist movement in the 1950's. "It's very easy to overlook women on the right because they they will often say, 'I'm just an housewife,' " says Ms. Brennan, who's writing a biography of Joseph McCarthy's wife. "By all accounts, Jean McCarthy wrote many of her husband's speeches, but she denied any responsibility."
 
Giving Weight To Women's Teas
 Women shied from the spotlight but organized postcard-writing campaigns, stuffed envelopes, held teas to raise money and educate each other about the dangers of Communism. Large caches of historical material on the popular conservative movement remain unexamined, Ms. Brennan says. As an example, she cites the University of Iowa's large collection of rightist publications, which function as an index to eight decades of community causes, from taxes to fluoridated water, from lax morals to integration.
For the last few years, historians have been grappling with the question of why conservatives, particularly the rank and file, have been ignored. In 1994, for example, the American Historical Review published a forum on the topic, with an article titled "Why Is There So Much Conservatism in the United States and Why Do So Few Historians Know Anything about It?" There isn't even a biography of Russell Kirk, whose 1953 book, "The Conservative Mind," gave American conservatives an identity and a genealogy and catalyzed the postwar movement.
That more conservative scholars themselves haven't mined this history is especially puzzling. Certainly one reason is that many had a more ambitious goal over the last couple of decades: to build a powerful political movement. The hundreds of conservative think tanks, organizations and publications that have sprung up in the last 20 years have grown into an "alternative academy," says George Nash, a conservative historian and author of "The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America." It has focused on current issues like taxes and foreign policy. Conservatives "ignored history," says Lee Edwards, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who is writing a political history of the movement.
There may be another reason that social history in particular has been sidestepped. "There is a conservative bias" against it, says the conservative historian Gertrude Himmelfarb, explaining that its practitioners often seem motivated by ideology. They distort history by elevating the marginalized over the powerful, she says, and disparage diplomatic, constitutional and intellectual studies as elitist.
Conservatism, with its reverence for authority and established hierarchies, may also not be hospitable ground for bottom-up history. Perhaps it's not surprising then that conservative historians have tended to emphasize institutions and elites, not grass-root activists; established leaders, not radicals.
Minority and feminist scholars -- the 60's multiculturalists -- were, in fact, the ones who seized on social history's bottom-up approach to recover their own neglected pasts. And just as women and blacks were once on the edges of a postwar Establishment dominated by white Democratic and liberal Republican men, so was the Right.
 
Why So Late? A Confession
 It was also on the fringe of the academic Establishment. Leo P. Ribuffo, a historian at George Washington University and an "unreconstructed McGovernite," compares the profession's neglect of the right to its initial cool reaction to early books about African-Americans, women and industrial workers.
The rise of the right in recent years -- and the appetite for fresh dissertation topics -- finally pushed liberal historians and graduate students to turn their attention to conservatives.
But why so belatedly?
In what may be the 90's version of liberal guilt, liberal historians are confessing to what conservatives have always accused them of: bias. "Most historians are looking for people in the past who can be positive examples for the present," says Benjamin Alpers, a liberal historian and co-organizer of a 1996 conference on conservatism at Princeton University. "They're driven to study people they are attracted to, and most historians are not on the right."
Many historians, accepting a hand-me-down liberalism, also didn't think they needed to study the right. "In the United States, liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition," Lionel Trilling famously declared in 1950. In the postwar blush, Trilling and other members of what is known as the consensus school believed the story of America was the story of the triumph of progressive reform, secular liberal values and science.
"Many historians are sympathetic to that development," George Nash says, "so that movements which opposed those trends are seen as reactionary or losers in history."
Conservatives had no ideas, Trilling argued, only "irritable mental gestures." Other consensus scholars like Richard Hofstadter, Daniel Bell and Seymour Martin Lipset argued the right was an economically and culturally backward fringe; people who were deviant, paranoid and resentful about their status in society.
Yet rather than wandering on the periphery, much of the right has stood solidly in the middle class, a garage door opener in one hand and a computer mouse in the other. "Finally, finally," says Gertrude Himmelfarb, "there is a rediscovery of a kind of populist conservatism." These are the people whom liberal historians are now studying.
In the end, the legacy of liberal bias may turn out to be the rescue of conservatives' history.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Rises Unexpectedly

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
Industrial production rose unexpectedly in March, increasing two-tenths of 1 percent, the Federal Reserve said today.
Production increased as utility output surged with the return of colder weather after a mild January and February. "A cool March pushed industrial production up, but the Asian influence on the U.S. economy will pick up as we move into the second quarter," said Arthur Quach, an economist with Daiwa Securities America in New York. "We are looking for slower growth in the second quarter." 
 A sharp economic slowdown has curtailed Asian demand for American products.
The Fed also revised its data for January and February to show that output at factories, utilities and mines declined two-tenths of 1 percent in each month. The Fed had previously said that February output was unchanged and that January production was up one-tenth of 1 percent. Before today's report, analysts had expected March's production to be unchanged.
Industrial output during the first quarter rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, the slowest pace in seven years.
Production at utilities rose 4.8 percent last month. Manufacturing output fell two-tenths of 1 percent as production of autos and trucks, fabricated metals, lumber and primary metals declined. Mining production rose two-tenths of 1 percent.
Capacity utilization, the rate at which producers are operating, fell to a 17-month low of 82.2 percent last month from a revised 82.3 percent during February.

HEADLINE: About New York;
Bronx Actors Play the Roles Of Their Lives

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
THE words to "God Bless the Child" echoed in the cavernous space, although the tune hardly calmed a baby squealing in the audience. Undeterred, a dozen people filed onto the stage and stood in a semicircle against a burlap backdrop. The house lights dimmed and their voices rose.
"Smoke, ashes, broken glass, confusion, grief," they called out, invoking the memory of modern plagues that battered their Bronx neighborhoods in the 1970's. 
 "In the morning I'd wake up to go to my job," Astin Jacobo declared. "And when I come home, everything was on fire."
Life inspired art by the very setting: a Bronx community center built on what had been a vacant lot at East 178th Street and Mapes Avenue. The tale unfolding on stage was real, cobbled together over the last 24 years the same way the actors had pieced together their neighborhoods with new homes, rebuilt apartments and gardens.
They all belonged to the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, a group of tenant associations and churches from a dozen communities that united in 1974 to stop the arson and abandonment that had already ravaged the borough's southern half. They survived and thrived, becoming players in a story of community renewal that is still being written.
"The history books say that there was a Civil War, Lincoln freed the slaves and that's it," said Lois Haar, who joined the coalition when she was a student at Fordham University. "There's more to that story. Just like our story. What could happen in 50 years is the books might say the Bronx was burning and then the banks reinvested. That happened. But who made it happen?"
The coalition's members originally wanted to make a video documentary about their history when they called upon Lyn Pyle, an artistic co-director of Mass Transit Street Theater and Video. As they traded ideas over breakfast at a Norwood diner, it dawned on them that an evening of storytelling would have more impact by using the very people who lived the stories. So what if they weren't trained actors.
"These were people who were used to improvising, and that's what gave me faith," Ms. Pyle said. "People who do this kind of community organizing respond to the moment to accomplish whatever they need to do with the politicians. If someone doesn't show up for a meeting, others are ready to show up in your corner."
FOR five weekends, coalition members traded stories to help Ms. Pyle come up with a broad outline of themes that would capture the group's struggles and spirit. They recalled days when "smoke was the perfume of the Bronx" and how one woman lived in an "ice castle" whose hallways were sheathed in layers of frozen water that had cascaded down the stairs. They recounted how they forced landlords, banks and bureaucrats to deal with crumbling buildings and dirty streets. They also spoke about a person or event that prodded them into action.
"I don't know if being an Irish Catholic is an event, but I believed what they told me in church," Ms. Haar said. "When I was a kid they told me we were all equal in God's eyes and would have justice. That wasn't true in practice. The coalition offered a way to practice that."
It also gave a way to meet people from different neighborhoods and cultures who shared a common frustration with the "experts" who tried to hoodwink them into complacency and powerlessness. Their stories made clear that things could change when they united for the neighborhood's future. In turn, they found drama in the daily, and history on their street corners. It all offers inspiration to those who moved into new homes and encouragement to those who never left.
"So many things conspired against staying put," Ms. Haar admitted. "Mortgages for Levittown, the G.I. Bill, highways. Moving was the American solution. It was how you showed progress that you were doing better because you could leave where you came from. Maybe I should have lived in the Middle Ages, since I'm happy to stay with the same four walls."
Thursday night, she and her friends faced the theater's fourth wall, the audience. Among them were people who had once looked at piles of junk and declared that their home would one day be built right there. When someone flubbed a line, others stepped in. They improvised. These people know how to make something from nothing. "We take from here," Mr. Jacobo said at the show's end. "We take from there. And here we are."

HEADLINE: Rape and Murder Stalk Women in Northern Mexico

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico

 BODY:
Juarez is a city of factories set in the Chihuahua desert, with most of the assembly lines worked by women. And one or perhaps several sexual predators are prowling its vast industrial parks and honky-tonk saloons where workers go to kick back.
At least 70 women, many of them manufacturing workers, have been raped and murdered and their bodies dumped in the Chihuahua desert over the last five years. 
 Twice, authorities have charged suspects with multiple homicide and declared the problem solved. But Juarez women keep dying; a dozen bodies have turned up amid the cactus already this year, and five more have been reported missing. On April 16, the body of an unidentified teen-age girl, raped and strangled, was discovered under a railroad trestle, the Juarez police said.
The murders have shone a spotlight not only on the victimization of women in a city that runs on their $3-a-day labor, but also on the growing influence of a fledgling women's movement galvanized into action by the sexual attacks.
Many young women drawn here by Juarez's 400 tax-free maquiladora assembly plants break with the conservative customs of their rural villages, often pooling resources to live with other women and pursuing an independent social life. Feminist groups and congresswomen say they believe the violence is fed by a male backlash, and they criticize the stumbling official investigation of the killings as an example of mismanagement, mediocrity and machismo.
"Juarez is the ideal place to kill a woman, because you're certain to get away with it," said Astrid Gonzalez Davila, a founder of the Citizens Committee Against Violence, a group that works with the relatives of murder victims.
"The failure to solve these killings is turning the city into a mecca for homicidal maniacs."
Juarez has always been violent, but previously there was no reason to suspect that the murders of women were part of a chain of related events. The government says that 95 women have been murdered in this city of 1 million residents in five years; feminist groups have counted 118.
The killings have become a national scandal and have put pressure on the Governor of Chihuahua, Francisco Barrio Terrazas, for a stepped-up investigation. In an interview, Mr. Barrio said the murder rate for women is no higher than for most other Mexican cities (although Juarez women are twice as likely to be murdered as New York City women) and defended his government's inquiry.
"It's been very well handled," he said.
But several Mexican federal congresswomen who traveled to Juarez in February on a fact-finding mission disagreed. "This investigation has left a bad taste in our mouth," said Representative Laura Itzel Castillo. "There's been no professionalism."
The murders first attracted attention in 1993, when a criminology professor at the Chihuahua State police academy, Oscar Maynez Grijalva, noticed that virtually all the victims were poor, young, slender women with cinnamon skin and long dark hair. He tried to persuade Chihuahua officials that a serial killer was loose but he was ignored. He later resigned in protest.
"The authorities were just indifferent," said Irma Perez Franco, the mother of a 20-year-old shoe store clerk who was murdered in 1985. The police treated her with disdain from the moment she reported her daughter's disappearance, she said. "This didn't matter to them at all."
Mrs. Perez finally persuaded detectives to question her daughter's co-workers to determine who had seen her last. "But all they wanted to do was look at the cowboy boots and flirt with the clerks," she said. "They had no investigative plan."
During the same weeks in which Mrs. Perez's daughter was killed, eight other bodies were discovered in one stretch of desert, and the public began to clamor for police action.
In October 1995, authorities arrested Sharif Sharif, an Egyptian chemist, after a Juarez prostitute accused him of raping her at his home. The authorities discovered that in the 1980's, before moving to Juarez in 1994, Mr. Sharif had been convicted twice of sexual assault in Florida. He had served six years of a 12-year sentence for the second crime, the beating and rape of his live-in housekeeper in Gainesville.
The authorities announced that they had found the Juarez predator. They charged Mr. Sharif with the murder of six women, but a judge dismissed those charges in 1986. The day of Mr. Sharif's release, prosecutors filed new charges, accusing him of the murder of another woman.
In an interview at his prison quarters here, Mr. Sharif acknowledged that he frequented bars where some murder victims have been kidnapped, but said, "Raping and killing people is not my business."
Irene Blanco, a Juarez woman whom Mr. Sharif has appointed as his advocate said: "The authorities needed a scapegoat and chose Sharif."
The police in Florida, however, have urged Mexican authorities not to release Mr. Sharif. "He's demonstrated himself to be a vicious predator of women," said Capt. Sadie Darnell of the Gainesville police.
Mr. Sharif's guilt is debated hotly in Juarez. But what is indisputable is that since his arrest the killings have continued.
In April 1996, the authorities raided several bars and detained nearly 200 Juarez youths, including Sergio Armendariz, a 28-year-old nightclub security guard, along with several members of a gang he was said to lead. Mr. Armendariz and half a dozen others were later charged with murdering 17 women.
But the integrity of the investigation came under attack when Chihuahua human rights officials accused the police of torturing several Juarez teen-agers to coerce their testimony against the gang members. In a prison interview, Mr. Armendariz said that after his arrest the police battered him for days, demanding that he sign a confession. "They beat me until they got tired of beating me," he said.
Jorge Lopez Molinar, the state's attorney in charge of the investigations, charged that the police had matched bite marks on several victims' bodies to Mr. Armendariz's teeth.
But since Mr. Armendariz's detention, the bodies of at least nine raped women have been found in the desert. Mr. Lopez acknowledged that about half a dozen recent murders fit a pattern of serial murder.
Robert K. Ressler, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who specialized in serial murder, said investigators should remain alert to the possibility that a psycopath is traveling to Juarez from the United States. "You could have a guy in the U.S. who goes down there periodically to do these things," he said.
In recent months, women's groups have staged protests accusing Chihuahua authorities of ignoring signs that a sexual predator remains on the loose. A leader has been Esther Chavez Cano, an accountant who pieced together a detailed list of victims that has helped their families monitor the investigation.
Mrs. Chavez said that machismo, rooted in a popular culture across northern Mexico that glorifies ruthless desert horsemen who force women into submission, may be stronger here than elsewhere in the country. Yet in recent decades, thousands of women have taken factory jobs in Juarez and the numbers of single mothers have surged.
"Women have not become liberated, they just have a double workload," but some men resent what they perceive as women's newly independent lifestyles, she said. "A patriarchal backlash has accompanied these murders," Ms. Chavez said. Authorities often suggest that murdered women have invited attack by wearing mini-skirts or going out dancing, she said.
"They minimize the crimes and blame the victims," Mrs. Chavez said.

HEADLINE: Awash in U.S. Aid. Could Float Fine Without It.

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
Israel's newfound economic success through its embrace of high-profit, high-technology industries has led many Israelis and Americans to question why the nation still needs so much American foreign aid.
Israel is the largest beneficiary of American foreign aid -- by far. It received $3 billion in American economic and military assistance last year, a figure that has held steady for several years even as the overall foreign aid budget has been slashed at the demand of Congress. 
 Egypt is in second place in the ranking of beneficiaries, receiving about $2 billion last year. The two countries were rewarded with huge packages as a result of the 1979 Camp David accords, and together they account for about 40 percent of the American foreign aid budget.
But today the Israeli Government is being forced to admit the obvious: while American aid money is welcome, it is no longer a necessity.
There was widespread applause -- and relief -- among American lawmakers in 1996 when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed "economic independence" before a joint session of Congress, offering "to begin the long-term process of gradually reducing the level of your generous economic assistance to Israel."
What that means is still in debate.
The Israeli Government has proposed a phaseout of the $1.2 billion in economic aid now promised to Israel in exchange for a one-third increase in military assistance over the next 10 to 12 years. Military aid would grow to $2.4 billion a year from $1.8 billion under the plan. This would mean an overall reduction in the aid package of $600 million a year, or 20 percent.
Representative Sonny Callahan, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees aid to Israel, said last month that the Israeli proposal to reduce aid was "a tremendous recognition of accomplishment -- accomplishment on the part of both countries."
But others in Congress think the Israelis should be willing to accept far larger cuts, although few are willing to say so publicly for fear of offending the American Jewish community or Israel's powerful lobby on Capitol Hill.
As one Congressional aide put it: "Many people here consider it a taboo subject, but the fact is that the Israelis have got to understand that other, far more needy countries are being cut off completely from American aid. Yes, they are talking about ending the economic aid, but they're also talking about a big increase in military aid."
The initial Israeli proposal also drew criticism because of Israel's request that it be permitted to spend more of its military aid in Israel. Under the current package, Israel is limited to spending no more than 25 percent of the American military aid in Israel. Israeli officials' request to spend more of the aid at home has alarmed American defense contractors.
The United States has not always been so generous with Israel. In the first years after its creation in 1948, the United States provided almost no direct support. The first significant aid, totaling $86.4 million, was made available in 1952.
"I think the United States was unclear whether this new experiment was going to survive," said Arthur S. Berger, a former State Department spokesman on Middle East issues who is now with the American Jewish Committee. "Also at that time, the American lobby for the Arab world was exceedingly strong, both within the State Department and from the oil companies."
Israel's overwhelming victory in the 1967 war led to a rethinking of American strategy in the Middle East -- and the spigot of aid for Israel finally opened wide.
The annual aid package for Israel grew from $13.1 million in 1967, to $76.8 million in 1968, to $600 million in 1971. By the late 1970's, Israel had become the largest single recipient of American aid.
The Camp David agreement in 1979 between Israel and Egypt led the United States to promise large aid packages to both nations. By 1985, the annual package for Israel totaled about $3 billion. The figure has changed little since then.
During much of the 1980's and early 1990's, American assistance was all that stood between Israel and economic collapse. But with the turnaround of the Israeli economy, that has changed.
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the powerful lobbying group in Washington, insists that Israel will continue to need military assistance for years. But it acknowledges that the need for economic help is fading.
"I think there's a recognition on the part of both the Administration and Congress that Israel still faces military dangers," said Howard Kohr, the committee's executive director. "But I think clearly there will be a time when there won't be a need for economic assistance. This is a sign of Israel's growing economic independence."

HEADLINE: Israel Redefines Its Dream, Finding Wealth in High Tech

SERIES: ISRAEL AT 50: Oranges to Software

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: KIBBUTZ GIVAT BRENNER, Israel, April 17

 BODY:
The exit for Kibbutz Givat Brenner, the largest of Israel's proud old collective farms, is marked by a bright sign for "House of Dreams."
House of Dreams is actually an amusement park that the 70-year-old kibbutz now runs to pad the waning income from its orchards, plant nurseries and aging factories. But the name also carries a poignant echo of the dreams of the early Zionists from Russia, who landed on the shores of the Promised Land envisioning a Jewish nation forged in the selflessness of collective field labor. 
 A few miles north in Tel Aviv, in a concrete block of offices on what were barren sand dunes when the state of Israel was born, several dozen men and women, all in jeans, shorts and T-shirts and well short of 30, worked intently at their computers while sipping cappuccino from paper cups. On a sheet of typing paper taped to the door, these rooms are identified as the offices of Mirabilis, from the Latin for miracle.
Seventeen months ago, Mirabilis did not exist. Today, the innovative chat software invented by its four founders, ICQ (read "I seek you"), is one of the hottest new instruments on the Internet, with 10 million registrations and as many as 57,000 new users daily.
Though only a few miles lie between the "dreams" and the "miracle," they trace the extraordinary road Israel has traveled from the socialist experiment of defiant European Jews to the high-tech revolution that has created a Silicon Valley in the Middle East, second only to the United States in start-ups.
High tech now accounts for nearly a third of all Israeli exports, and with close to 3,000 start-ups and research-and-development projects, the share is likely to continue growing.
By any yardstick, Israel is prosperous -- more than it has ever been -- and learning to love it. Exports have catapulted to about $32 billion last year, most of them industrial and scientific, from $30 million in 1948, most of them agricultural. The per-capita gross domestic product has reached $17,000, more than Portugal or Spain, and many times that of Israel's Arab neighbors. Some 120 Israeli companies are traded on New York exchanges, which places it second among foreign countries only to Canada.
The wealth is tangible. Visitors are regularly struck by the proliferation of cell phones, on which Israelis spend more time talking than any other people. With 1.6 million in use, Israel has one for every three people. The number of cars has almost doubled in nine years, to 1.65 million last year from 882,000 in 1988, and big luxury sedans are no longer exotic. People for whom traveling abroad used to be an impossible dream now pour out of the country in droves for vacations in Europe, South America and Asia. Cafes, gourmet restaurants, shopping malls and outlets of every American chain sprout routinely in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
A report recently prepared by the United States-Israel Joint Economic Development Group, a panel of government and private experts in both countries led by Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, praised the Israeli Government for making "tremendous strides" in reforming its economy and declared that the country now "stands at the cusp of developed-country status."
 
'Tremendous Strides,' And Growing Pains Too
It is also true that Israel has not done it alone. For decades, West Germany and now Germany have paid reparations for the Holocaust, and since the 1979 Camp David peace accord, the United States has been doling out a hefty $3 billion in annual aid, $1.8 billion of it military, making Israel by far the biggest single recipient of American foreign aid.
The success has not come without serious glitches. Current indicators point to an incipient recession. Unemployment in a country that once prided itself on finding jobs for every citizen has reached 8.2 percent, most of it concentrated in angry blue-collar "development towns."
In December rioting broke out in the Negev town of Ofakim after unemployment there reached 14.3 percent.
Tensions with the Palestinians because of the stagnation in peace negotiations under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have battered tourism, and some economists fear that the problems could also start scaring investors away.
Mr. Eizenstat, for one, warned in his report that the impasse "is a major element in the current difficulties Israel is having," especially in tourism. Eventually, he said, foreign investment could also suffer.
Another, less tangible problem is that the high-tech revolution and the global reach it has given Israel could further distance Israel economically from its Arab neighbors, delaying even longer the dream of a "new Middle East" that accompanied the 1993 Oslo peace agreements.
Today, 96 percent of Israel's exports and 93 percent of its imports have destinations outside the region.
But whatever the difficulties, and the Middle East is never without them, the trendy upper-middle-class youths hanging out at the sushi bars on Tel Aviv's Ha'Arbaa Street represent a remarkable evolution from the ascetic soldier-farmers of the pioneering kibbutzim.
"I remember when Tel Aviv streets were sand," said Dan Propper, president of the Manufacturers Association and managing director of OSEM, a group of food manufacturing companies. "I remember convoys of camels taking orange crates to Jaffa ports, one tied to the tail of the other. Bedouins pastured their goats in the streets. jackals roamed the center of Tel Aviv."
Even five years after the founding of Israel, Avner Zaks, the secretary of the Givat Brenner kibbutz, remembered how the veterans -- those who had pitched the first tents and broken the first land in 1928 -- wept when they heard of Stalin's death. That was before the terrible human cost of his utopia was revealed, and when collective labor was still the dominant ethic of the Jewish state.
That ethic still survives here at Givat Brenner in the communal dining room, in the free housing, education and medical care, and in the pooling of all outside income.
"For many years we thought that working hard was enough," said Ruth Klidar, a longtime kibbutz member. "If we got up at 6 and worked through the afternoon, that was good.
"Then we found out that much of the work made no money. Take the dining room as an example -- it's basically a restaurant, which should have no more than 10 employees. We have 30, so we're losing money."
The real problem is not money -- Mr. Zaks said the kibbutz takes in about $27 million a year. But the major source of income now is the salaries of members who work outside, and fewer and fewer young people stay on. Mr. Zaks said that 85 percent of young people left after completing their education, and that fewer than 100 of the 12,000 people on the kibbutz were 25 to 35. Meanwhile, about 300 of the 850 full members are over 65.
"The young don't want everything in common," said Mr. Zaks, who at 53 is the classic icon of a kibbutznik with his trim figure, healthy tan and dusty sandals. "They want more control over their lives. You have to adapt to a new system of living. We built this on the ethic of sacrifice. But now our mission is finished."
 
Collective Evolution, Industry Revolution
That mission was initially to settle the biblical homeland, to defend it and make it bloom. But the goals began to evolve even before the founding of the Jewish state.
During World War II, Givat Brenner began supplying products for the British Army, laying the foundation for exports. The need for irrigation equipment led to creation of a foundry. This has evolved into a specialized aluminum die-casting company, which now produces, among other things, the housing for emergency phones along the New Jersey Turnpike.
With time the kibbutz added a juice factory, a furniture factory, a large nursery, and turf production for lawns and parks, in addition to its agricultural products.
A similar evolution was taking place in the state as a whole. "When you're looking at the development of Israeli industry," Mr. Propper said, "you're really looking at the development of the country."
"Industry was established at the beginning of the century for agriculture," he added. "In the second stage, we supplied the British and other armies. Then came the war of independence of 1948, and the beginning of the arms industry. Then in the early 1950's came the immigration from North Africa. The land couldn't supply enough jobs, so factories had to be built, and the 'development towns' grew around textile plants."
After the 1967 war, France declared an embargo on weapons exports to Israel, forcing the sophisticated arms development that eventually gave rise to the high-tech revolution.
The major change, said Amotz Asa-El, associate editor of the Jerusalem Post and its former business editor, came with an abortive attempt in 1977 to scuttle socialism. The economy was not prepared, and it sank into hyperinflation.
"In 1985," Mr. Asa-El said, "to deal with hyperinflation, the unity Government led by Shimon Peres launched a stabilization plan that laid the foundations for the kind of economy Israel now has. He ordered a freeze in the humongous public sector, he emancipated the central bank, he ordered a deep cut in the defense budget, from a sixth of the entire budget to about 10 to 13 percent, where it now stands."
The measures had two major effects. Generally, they launched the process of liberalization and privatization that Mr. Netanyahu has campaigned to accelerate. Specifically, the cut in the military budget fed the civilian high-tech industry.
This time Israel was ready. Since the mid-1970's, many thousands of Israelis had lived or trained abroad.
"Look at us today," said Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman, who has led a campaign to liberalize the economy. "We have a situation where the Prime Minister graduated in business from M.I.T. The governor of the Bank of Israel, Jacob Frankel, has a Ph.D. from Chicago University and was a long time with the World Bank in Washington. I taught at N.Y.U., at Cardozo Law School and at U.C.L.A., and as a tax lawyer for the past 25 years have been exposed to many American multinationals."
The Netanyahu administration has been credited with considerable progress in liberalization, privatization and opening markets, though Mr. Eizenstat said in his report that Israel should further reduce the budget deficit, government spending and taxes.
For Israel's 50th anniversary, which by the Hebrew calendar falls this year on April 30, Mr. Netanyahu has pledged to further ease restrictions on the shekel, making it effectively a convertible currency for the Israelis. For the first time Israeli citizens will be allowed to get and use foreign currencies freely, to hold bank accounts abroad and to buy foreign real estate.
 
Inroads Toward Peace And Exits From Russia
Two more major shifts occurred in the early 1990's: the arrival of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the collapsing Soviet Union, and the breakthroughs in Israeli-Arab relations at the 1991 Madrid Conference and the 1993 Oslo agreements.
The immigrants brought a rich array of skills, especially in the sciences. Though negative stereotypes of Russians persist, rare is the high-tech company without its share of talented Russians.
While the peace initiatives failed to generate the hoped-for trade or partnership with the Arabs, they gave Israel a new respectability abroad, opening new markets in Southeast Asia, the former Soviet Union and Africa. Real exports grew by 15 percent every year, and investments began to flood in, reaching a record $3.7 billion last year.
Some economists warn that things may slide if the momentum in peacemaking does not resume. Mr. Asa-El disagrees.
"The Oslo process is not undone yet," he said. "Stagnation, yes; procrastination, yes; tension, yes; but not a reversal. Investors don't give a damn whether there's a 'comprehensive peace.' They only want to know that people will show up tomorrow and continue producing lucrative products."
Besides, high tech is by nature less sensitive to politics than other industries. As Mr. Neeman noted, "If there's trouble, you pop your diskette into your pocket and continue somewhere else."
Even more than that, the Internet liberated computer-savvy Israeli youths from the country's biggest handicap: its isolation from markets.
"This is the modern gold rush," said Yossi Vardi, an Israeli businessman who found the financial backing for the four young founders of Mirabilis, one of whom is his son. "There were railroads, radio, television. But in cyberspace, no government has to grant a concession; you don't need a lobby. The concession is granted by people to whom you give the best product."
ICQ has attracted enormous attention among followers of the Internet -- Mirabilis recently held an on-line party for its 10 millionth registration. But because attracting followers has so far been the company's main goal, it has yet to charge -- or make -- a shekel. The founders have no doubt that the money will come when the time is right.
And the money can be big. Another pair of Israelis, Gil Schwed and Shlomo Kramer, had an idea for a network fire-wall system -- programs that protect computer systems from incursions. They parlayed it into CheckPoint Software Technologies Ltd., whose sales last year totaled $83 million -- up 160 percent from the year before.
At Mirabilis, the idea was software that allows users to communicate with others even while they are linked to other sites. Spread only by "word of mouse," without paid publicity, Mirabilis was an instant success in the rapidly spreading world of the Internet. Not surprisingly, more than half of ICQ's users are under 25, while only 2 percent are over 55.
In one of the cramped cubicles in the offices of Mirabilis, two of the founders -- Yair Goldfinger, 26, the chief technical officer, and Asaf Vigiser, 25, the president -- still seemed to treat their success as something of a lark. Mr. Vigiser never finished high school. Yet in about a year and a half, the four friends looking for a way to harness their computer addiction have gained 65 employees and a potential fortune.
The offices have no identifiable decor: boxes compete with workstations for floor space, and the walls are bare aside from a miniature basketball hoop, and posters from American media.
"Look at us," said Mr. Goldfinger, a John Lennon look-alike in shorts and pigtail. "We were just four Amiga and Internet freaks, and the only way for us to make it was the Net. Here people come and go whenever they want. Everyone loves it. It's a cult. For me it's like a cigarette -- it's an addiction."
"Why in Israel?" he added. "I guess it's in the nature of the culture. Israelis have always been good commandos. They don't go by the book. They look for the cutting edge, for a way to do it."

HEADLINE: U.S. TRADE DEFICIT SOARS AS EXPORTS TO JAPAN DECLINE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
American exports to Japan plummeted in February, helping send the United States trade deficit to its widest gap in a decade and demonstrating how the effects of Japan's stalled economy are spreading beyond its shores.
The trade figures, released by the Commerce Department today, substantiated other evidence of a severe economic downturn in Japan, where consumer spending on both Japanese and foreign goods, ranging from clothes to computers to cars, has slowed dramatically. 
 The figures also seemed bound to increase the tension between Washington and Tokyo over Japan's slow reaction to the severity of its economic problems and the pain they can cause elsewhere. The deterioration in the world's second-largest economy and broader weakness in Asia are already hurting the profits of American high-technology companies and other exporters. Japan's weakness is also creating harmful ripple effects in Asian countries struggling to recover from a financial crisis that began last summer.
The United States deficit in trade of goods and services rose to $12.1 billion in February from a revised figure of $11.5 billion the previous month. This was the largest gap since the Commerce Department began measuring trade figures on a monthly basis in 1992, and it was last exceeded in 1987, under a system that measured trade quarterly.
Years ago today's news would have been regarded as dire for the American economy. Today it seemed to say more about Japan's troubles.
With the American economy short of skilled workers, the old concern about trade deficits -- that imports are taking jobs from American workers -- is rarely discussed in Washington. Moreover, the influx of more low-priced imported goods is one reason inflation has been low.
American exports of goods to Japan in February totaled $4.64 billion, down nearly 15 percent from the same month a year ago, when they were at $5.45 billion. That was a dramatic deterioration from January, when the level of exports to Japan barely changed from a year earlier.
Although monthly trade data can fluctuate and do not necessarily indicate a trend, the February figures are an embarrassment to both the Japanese authorities and to the Clinton Administration, which promised that its drive in the first term to negotiate market-opening agreements in Japan would result in a slow but steady increase in American goods to Japanese consumers.
Imports from Japan rose only modestly, to $9.93 billion from $9.70 billion a year ago. Exports and imports of services, which are inherently more difficult to measure, are not recorded each month on a country-by-country basis.
While the American economy remains strong, the risk of declining exports to Japan is minimal, and in fact they help keep the United States economy from overheating. But should the American economy slow considerably, declining exports to Japan could take their toll.
Today's figures suggest that pressure may grow within Japan for a further devaluation of the yen, which would make the country's cars, electronics and other goods more competitive abroad and is one way Japan could strengthen its economy.
But over the last week, Japanese authorities have been desperately trying to lift the yen, largely to contain a growing political problem for Tokyo here and in Asia.
Both the United States and Japan's neighbors have criticized Japan for doing too little to lift the rest of Asia out of its troubles. They argue that a stronger yen is needed to help stimulate more exports to Japan. So far the effort to talk up the yen has been unsuccessful: After a meeting of the largest industrialized countries here on Wednesday, the yen continued to fall against the dollar.
Today the chief of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Joseph Yam, warned that a major devaluation of the yen could easily touch off another devastating round of trouble for countries throughout Asia.
"Further volatility in the yen may produce another round of competitive devaluations in other countries," Mr. Yam told reporters here this morning, at the conclusion of three days of meetings that sought to diagnose the causes of the Asian crisis.
Today's report showed that Asia now accounts for roughly two-thirds of America's trade deficits.
"It is the Asian financial crisis and the effects of that and Japan," Robert Shapiro, a top Commerce Department official, said today, explaining the record-high deficit. "The fact is, our exports are growing in every other region of the world."
American exports to Mexico are up 23 percent so far this year, for example, and the trade deficit with Mexico has dropped by 43 percent, compared with last year. The trade surplus with South and Central America is up nearly tenfold in the first two months of this year, compared with the corresponding period in 1997, a statistic President Clinton seems likely to be touting this weekend at the second economic summit meeting of Latin American leaders. The trade gap with Western Europe is also headed down. But the big export problems are in countries hardest hit by the Asian crisis. American exports to South Korea were down 43 percent. They were down 52 percent to Indonesia and 18 percent to Thailand.
"There is a huge decrease in what we can import, and that may last a while," South Korea's Deputy Minister of Finance and Economy, Chung Duck Koo, said today. "We have gone through the first tunnel," he said of his country's brush with bankruptcy, "but we have two tunnels ahead" as banks revamp and companies lay off workers in coming months.
How quickly South Korea and its neighbors get through those tunnels, however, depends more and more on what happens in Japan. Events over the last week, when Japanese finance officials visited Washington but gave few specifics about their plans to stimulate the economy, created little confidence.
"We certainly don't feel any better, and maybe a little worse," one senior Administration official said after the meetings.
David Hale, the chief economist for Zurich Research, concluded earlier this week that Japan's problems posed a double threat.
"Unless the yen falls in value, Japanese firms will have little way out of the country's worsening recession," he said. "But if it is allowed to fall, there could be many unpleasant side effects."

HEADLINE: Case Before Supreme Court May Be Key to Jones Appeal

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
Whether Paula Corbin Jones succeeds in her efforts to reinstate her lawsuit against President Clinton may depend on a different case that will be argued in less than a week before the United States Supreme Court, lawyers who deal with sexual harassment issues said today.
On Wednesday, the Justices will be asked to decide whether a Chicago businesswoman may claim sexual harassment after she was subjected to sexual advances by a supervisor, but suffered no adverse job consequences after she refused to comply. One issue is whether a legal case of sexual harassment is possible when no tangible detriments occur at the workplace. 
 In dismissing the Jones lawsuit earlier this month, a Federal judge said one reason for the ruling was that Ms. Jones failed to show any tangible detriment at her job even if the allegations she made about President Clinton were true. Ms. Jones had argued that after she rebuffed a crude sexual advance in 1991 at a Little Rock, Ark., hotel from Mr. Clinton, who was then Governor of Arkansas, she suffered in various ways at her state clerical job.
In her ruling, Judge Susan Webber Wright of Federal District Court took note of the upcoming Supreme Court argument and said it would have no relevance to the Jones case because the circumstances were different.
But Yolanda Wu, a staff lawyer at the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, said that if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the Chicago woman, Kimberley B. Ellerth, Ms. Jones's chances of winning her appeal would be greatly enhanced. "It's very much the same legal issue in the Paula Jones case," Ms. Wu said, "whether you have suffered some tangible or economic harm to make out a case of sexual harassment."
Lawyers for Ms. Jones, who announced this week that they would ask the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, to hear their appeal, did not detail their legal arguments. But Ms. Jones's main lawyer, Donovan Campbell Jr., referred to next week's Supreme Court argument in Burlington Industries v. Ellerth. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, ruled that Ms. Ellerth's case should go forward even though she had suffered no obvious harm at the workplace. Ms. Ellerth had sued Burlington Industries, charging that a vice president for whom she worked made frequent comments about her legs, said he could make life at the office difficult for her, asked her to engage in sex with him and said that he was reluctant to promote her because she was unwilling to comply. But she was promoted nevertheless.
Michael C. Lynch, a Washington lawyer who specializes in sexual discrimination suits, said that if the court ruled in favor of Ms. Ellerth, "it may even compel the Eighth Circuit to reverse Judge Wright."
Judge Wright had written that the cases were different because Ms. Ellerth had been threatened but there was no similar threat in Ms. Jones's case.
Ms. Yu also noted that the courts have been split on a separate issue central to the Jones case, whether a single sexual advance may be so egregious as to create a hostile work environment.
The Supreme Court said in a 1986 case that a sexual advance had to be "severe" to create a sexually hostile environment. Judge Wright's ruling suggested that a one-time encounter could only meet this requirement if it was something akin to a sexual assault. She said Mr. Clinton's behavior, if true, would be boorish but would fall short of that standard.
A third avenue for appeal could be the interpretation of an Arkansas statute making "outrage" ground for a civil lawsuit. Judge Wright was obliged to consider Arkansas law in evaluating whether Mr. Clinton's alleged behavior could be said to be outrageous conduct.
But lawyers noted that her opinion did not mention a Feb. 12 ruling by the Arkansas Supreme Court, which offered a fresh interpretation of the outrage law. The state Supreme Court, in a split opinion, ruled that a case should be allowed to go to trial in which five women had charged that a doctor improperly and needlessly touched their breasts during medical examinations.
While that behavior might seem less offensive than the complaint against Mr. Clinton -- that he lowered his trousers and asked Ms. Jones to perform oral sex -- Debra S. Katz, a lawyer specializing in sexual harassment suits, said the Arkansas court ruling does not help Ms. Jones.
"That opinion rested on the notion that there was a special relationship between a doctor and his patient," she said. "That could even help Clinton's case since I don't think there's an argument to be made that such a relationship exists between an employer and an employee."
John W. Whitehead, the president of the Rutherford Institute, which is paying Ms. Jones's legal expenses, but not lawyers' fees, said he was considering providing a grant to her lawyers who have been working without pay.
Mr. Campbell said today that he believed his unreimbursed fees totaled $500,000 to $1 million.
Mr. Whitehead said that he believed the lawyers' costs were close to $1 million but that any grant his organization would make would fall far short of that.

HEADLINE: Fare Promotions Snarl Bus Service, Critics Say

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
The Metrocard has done such a good job of luring commuters to city buses that rider advocates and union officials say an old demon has returned in force: "bus bunching."
The so-called bunching occurs when buses on the same route get caught in traffic and arrive at certain stops at the same time, creating long gaps in service. And sometimes, the critics said, there is no room for passengers when the buses get there. 
 The advocates and union officials blamed the bunching on what they said was the transit authority's failure to increase the number of buses on busy routes.
Ridership on the city's 220 bus routes increased to almost 1.6 million in February from 1.3 million in February 1997, or about 20 percent, according to the latest statistics available from New York City Transit. The average weekday ridership increased by 114,000 passengers a day on 42 high-volume routes in the fall of 1997, compared with the fall of 1996, the transit authority said.
Reasons for the increased ridership, said Jared Lebow, a transit spokesman, are the free transfers between subways and buses that were introduced last July; the Metrocard bonus program, which gives riders a free trip with each $15 purchase, and the city's robust economy, which is generating more workers -- and thus more commuters.
In response to the increased demand, the transit authority added service on 32 bus routes in March, Mr. Lebow said, and increased the number of bus operators by 500 -- to 8,000 -- over the last year. In June, the transit authority will increase service on 46 more routes, he said.
But the critics called the effort too little too late, saying they had warned officials almost a year ago that ridership on buses would increase with the free Metrocard transfers. "They were never prepared for this," said Gil Rodriguez, a vice president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, which represents 7,000 operators. "On some routes, people are being turned away, while others are being packed in like sardines."
Larry Hanley, president of Local 726 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents about 1,100 operators and mechanics on Staten Island, said that of the 160 daily trips that originate from the borough, 1,300 people must stand during the 40-minute ride to Manhattan.
"Historically, the transit authority was careless about responding to ridership growth," Mr. Hanley said. "But they need more help and more growth."
Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group for riders, said commuters in boroughs outside Manhattan are hardest hit by bunching.
One passenger, Mike Renner, 42, a car-service driver who lives in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, was waiting yesterday for the B-63 bus near Ninth Street and Fifth Avenue in Park Slope. "My biggest complaint is the wait between buses," he said. "Sometimes it takes 15 to 20 minutes, and other times you'll get three buses coming in a row."
The transit agency does not keep statistics on bunching, but it tracks "service regularity," the percentage of buses that arrive within 50 percent of the scheduled interval after the previous bus. For example, if a bus is due every 8 minutes, the route's regularity rating is the percentage of buses that arrive between 4 and 12 minutes after the last bus.
From the fall of 1996 -- before the explosion in bus ridership -- to fall 1997, regularity declined on 33 of the 48 major routes the authority tracks.
In Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, the boroughs most affected by the free transfers, the percentage of buses arriving at regular intervals declined on 22 routes and improved on 3.
"Buses are swimming in riders," Mr. Russianoff said. "What these numbers show is that they need to add more service."
Tony Neo, a 30-year-old banker who lives in Bayside, Queens, commutes daily to Forest Hills on the Q-46, where regularity dropped to 56 percent during the last quarter of 1997 from 74 percent during the last quarter of 1996. He believes that any delays he has experienced are the result of human error on the part of neophyte riders.
"If there's any delay in getting on the bus, it's because people don't know how to put the card in the slot," Mr. Neo said. "I have to take the bus all the way up Union Turnpike to Bayside every day, so for me the card saves me two fares; it's good economics. There may be more people riding the bus, but I can't really tell the difference."

A Thread of Years
 By John Lukacs.
 481 pp. New Haven:
 Yale University Press. $30. 
 Of the many differences between the movie "Titanic" and history, one in particular is telling. In the movie, as the ship is sinking the first-class passengers (all third-class human beings) scramble to climb into the small number of life-boats. Only the determination of the hardy seamen -- who use guns to keep the grasping men at bay -- gets the women and children into the boats.
In fact, according to survivors' accounts, the "women and children first" convention was observed with almost no dissension, particularly among the upper classes. The statistics make this plain. In first class, every child was saved, as were all but five (of 144) women, three of whom chose to die with their husbands. By contrast, 70 percent of the men perished. In second class, 80 percent of the women were saved but 90 percent of the men drowned.
The men on the first-class list of the Titanic virtually made up the Forbes 400 of the time. John Jacob Astor, reputedly the richest man of his day, is said to have fought his way to a boat, put his wife in it and then stepped back and waved her goodbye. Benjamin Guggenheim similarly refused to take a seat, saying: "Tell my wife . . . I played the game out straight and to the end. No woman shall be left aboard this ship because Ben Guggenheim was a coward." In other words, some of the most powerful men in the world adhered to an unwritten code of honor -- even though it meant certain death for them. The movie makers altered the story for good reason: no one would believe it today.
It is the decline of codes of behavior like "the ideal of the gentleman" that John Lukacs mourns in "A Thread of Years," an impressionistic social history of the 20th century. An erudite and wide-ranging scholar who has written books on Hitler, Budapest, the cold war and Philadelphia aristocrats, Lukacs sees this ideal as inseparably tied up with Anglo-American civilization. Hence its decline is a symptom of the fall of that civilization. Britain and the United States may flourish as nations, economically, politically, even culturally. But culture and civilization are not the same. The Anglo-American self-conception as a distinct, superior civilization, with codes of behavior and honor, manners and morals, has faded. "That this belongs within the history of this century," Lukacs explains, "may be the theme of this book." It is a bold venture, since even to speak of the ideal of the gentleman today is to be considered slightly balmy, as if you wanted to reinstate the divine right of kings, outlaw electricity and put women in corsets.
Writing about something so intangible is difficult, and Lukacs has constructed an unusual form of history to do it, mixing fiction with analysis. The book is made up of 69 chapters, one for every year from 1901 to 1969. Each chapter begins with a brief fictional vignette depicting, for example, two men at a Philadelphia club in 1901, an American woman in Paris in 1920, a Roman Catholic college in America in 1961. Each vignette is followed by a few pages of dialogue between Lukacs and an imagined interlocutor, who together debate the choice and the meaning of the sketch. Why Philadelphia in 1901? Why American Catholics in 1961?
Now if this sounds odd, it is, but Lukacs disarmingly admits as much: "This book may be an attempt at a new genre. Do not take this too seriously." Alas, it doesn't really work. "A Thread of Years" has moments of beauty, insight and whimsy. But they do not add up to a coherent portrait or a sustained theme. In experimenting with fiction and history, the book falls between the two genres, having neither the texture of fiction nor the logic of history.
Lukacs handles many of the fictional vignettes skillfully, particularly those about Europe before World War II. He conjures up the smells inside a Swiss mountain lodge ("the faint trace of steam heat . . . the thin scent of varnished wood"), the sounds of arrival at a grand lake hotel ("the soft crunch of the gravel as the automobile rolls up the great curved driveway") and the look of a summer resort in 1915 ("People are sitting in white wicker armchairs on their porches or the front lawn, like a spread of black and white cauliflowers"). Few historians ever do this, leaving it to novelists like Dos Passos and Doctorow. Lukacs does it well, achieving what the great Dutch historian Johan Huizinga called "historical sensation. . . . A sense of streets, houses, fields, as well as sounds, colors."
But these achievements are fragmentary because Lukacs seems to want to tell two stories, maybe more, simultaneously. The first is quite simply that of the entire 20th century, or rather whichever of its highlights, moods and memories strike Lukacs's fancy. (There is a good bit about Hungary in this book.) The second, about the decline of the gentleman, pops up here and there but gets lost in the broader story. Lukacs has one character, a Philadelphia gent named K, who reappears now and then but never becomes the protagonist. Though there are three explanatory chapters, called "ribbons," placed at 20-year intervals, to let the reader feel the spine of the book, they don't really help, being mostly a potted history of the American century.
The dialogues often wander as freely as the vignettes, and we are treated to the author's pet enthusiasms and peeves on a variety of utterly unrelated subjects. (He hates the movie "Casablanca," Henry James and rock music, among other things, and likes Gershwin, Huizinga and Spain -- but dislikes Hemingway's use of Spanish.) Some of these diversions are individually a delight, but after a while you begin to resent the lack of discipline.
In his own impressionistic way, however, Lukacs does outline the fall of Anglo-American civilization and its ideals. He alludes to its causes -- the decline of Britain, the rise of immigrant and Catholic influences in American culture, the erosion of religion, the triumph of relativism, but perhaps most of all the loss of confidence. At its peak, the Anglo-American elite had a striking air of high-minded paternalism, born of a cultural sense of superiority and a Protestant sense of mission. The ideal of the gentleman was not simply a matter of manners but of morals. It was a way of embodying the values of that civilization -- fair play, decency, chivalry. These codes have been increasingly criticized over the course of this century as being artificial, ethnocentric and hypocritical -- all of which they were. But "hypocrisy," Lukacs explains, "is the cement that held civilization together." Standards should surely represent a society's highest aspirations, not its tawdry realities. And the artifice of good manners, vital to civil discourse, has now been replaced by "a moral and intellectual sleaziness pretending to be 'sincere.' " From the saccharine confessions of daytime television to the verbal abuse of talk shows, we have created our own brand of fakery.
Most important, we have freed our upper classes of any sense of responsibility. The rich will always be with us. Every society has an elite, those more wealthy or powerful or famous than the rest. We can only ask that it recognize that with this privilege come responsibilities. Social conventions, moral strictures, the gentleman's code, were all attempts to civilize the strong. (The first citation of "civilize" in the Oxford English Dictionary, Lukacs tells us, dates from 1601, when the word meant "to bring out of a state of barbarism, to instruct in the arts of life.")
Society expected the rich to behave themselves and conform to certain ways of living, spending and participating in the public life of the land. When they did, they were honored. Near East Potomac Park in Washington there stands a haunting monument, a statue of a man with arms outstretched, Christlike, with an inscription on its pedestal: "To the brave men of the Titanic, who gave their lives that women and children might be saved." It was erected by voluntary donations from 25,000 women. When the elite did not behave appropriately -- and they often broke their norms -- it was a matter of dishonor and disappointment. Today, by contrast, we expect very little of those in positions of power -- whether they are Presidents or tycoons or movie stars -- and they rarely disappoint us.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Drop in Asian Travelers Affects Tourism in U.S.

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
THE economic malaise that broke out in Asia last fall has helped make much of that continent a bargain basement for American travelers. But the conditions that have made Asia such a good value for visitors portend bad news for the tourist industries of Hawaii, California, Australia and New Zealand. And the ripple effects, mainly the tighter grip that Asian visitors will keep on purse strings, are expected to be felt from the casinos of Las Vegas to the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn.
"Clearly tourism from Asia is going to be off this year," said John Marks, president of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau. "We're already experiencing a dramatic decline from Korea. And tourism from Japan is also going to be off, but we just don't know how much. If I had to speculate, maybe 10 percent." 
 While Chinese tourists are turning up in greater numbers throughout Asia, the United States doesn't expect a significant number, at least in the short term. The main impediments are distance, cost and United States law requiring potential visitors to demonstrate to the United States consular officer in their country, and the immigration officer here, their intention to return home.
Northwest Airlines, which has had extensive routes to Asia for more than 50 years, says that tourism from Japan to the United States is already down about 10 percent through March 20 of this year, compared with the same period last year.
In 1996, the last year for which statistics are available, San Francisco had 384,000 visitors from Japan, 136,000 from Korea and 145,000 from Taiwan. Because the Taiwanese economy is comparatively healthy, Mr. Marks said, any drop in visitors from Taiwan this year should be minimal.
Los Angeles is also bracing for a drastic decrease in Korean visitors, who numbered about 200,000 in 1997, according to Bob Moore, of the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau. But while Mr. Moore said fewer Japanese tourists will go abroad this year, his talks with tour operators suggest that Los Angeles may attract the same number of Japanese visitors as last year, about 750,000 -- mainly because of bargain tour packages. "They're very attractive to the single female workers who make up a large part of the visitors from Japan," he said.
These observations were seconded by Frank Murakami, general manager of the Los Angeles office of the Japan Travel Bureau International, Japan's biggest travel company. "The trend this year is to Southern California," he said, because it is less expensive than San Francisco, and it is the jumping off point for Las Vegas.
The so-called Golden Triangle for Japanese tourists, Mr. Murakami added, used to be Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas. "Now it's Las Vegas, Disneyland and Universal Studios," he said.
Japanese are attracted to Las Vegas more for its entertainment than for gambling, according to Mr. Moore and others. But many Asian travelers visit Las Vegas primarily to gamble. Jason Ader, an analyst for Bear, Stearns, said the expected falloff in Asian tourism to the United States, which he forecast at about 10 percent, could cause a 10 to 15 percent reduction in baccarat revenues in Las Vegas through 1999 -- or as much as $60 million annually. Moreover, any decline in Asian tourism to Las Vegas will also be felt at the Grand Canyon, a popular day trip from the gambling mecca. The Mall of America is not making forecasts about numbers of Asian visitors, but a spokeswoman said that those who come are expected to be more frugal.
California still expects healthy tourism overall in 1998, spurred by domestic travel and more visitors from Canada and Mexico. But Hawaii is especially vulnerable to a drop in visitors from Asia -- or anywhere else. Tourism is far and away Hawaii's biggest industry, accounting for about $11 billion in revenues a year, a third of its jobs and a quarter of its tax revenues.
Tony Vericella, the president of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau, predicted that arrivals from Korea, which numbered 122,000 last year, could drop as much as 80 percent in 1998. While arrivals from Japan are expected to be within 1 percent above or below last year's 2.1 million total, Mr. Vericella said, the weak yen means that the Japanese who do visit Hawaii will have fewer dollars to spend. Spending by Japanese tourists has already fallen from an average $354 a day a few years ago, the visitors bureau said, to $298 last year.
The Asian economic crisis also slammed Australia and New Zealand, both of which had been expecting a strong 1998. Australia had especially high hopes, after a 7 percent gain in fiscal 1997 that resulted in a record 4.3 million foreign visitors and $6.1 billion in tourist revenues. Instead, international arrivals are expected to plummet between 6 and 9 percent, according to Australia's Tourism Forecasting Council, and tourism earnings could fall 20 percent -- despite a projected doubling of visitors from China, who still represent only a trickle. On the other hand low air fares and package tours enticed enough North Americans in the past two months that Australian tourist officials are projecting a 6 percent increase in their numbers this year. But with The World Tourism Organization predicting that the financial crisis within the Asia Pacific region will keep about 12 million Asian tourists from traveling throughout Asia by the year 2000, the outlook is not bright.

HEADLINE: Checking Medicine's Vital Signs

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein; Michael M. Weinstein, an economist, is a member of the editorial board of The Times.

 BODY:
Three jumbo jets crashing every two days. If the airlines killed that many people annually, public outrage would close them overnight. Hospitals kill that many patients every year because of missed diagnoses, medication mishaps and other preventable errors. Yet there's hardly a whimper of protest.
Shocking? Choke on these findings by some of the nation's leading researchers: 
 Medical errors account for up to a quarter of the deaths from heart attack, stroke and pneumonia. Perhaps half the nation's diabetics are treated improperly. Up to 85 percent of prescribed medical treatments lack scientific validation. An intensive-care unit at one medical center committed nearly two errors per patient each day, a third of which were potentially serious. Surgeons in some parts of the country perform mastectomies rather than lumpectomies on Medicare patients 35 times more often than those in other regions, and for no apparent medical reason. Rates of heart surgery vary by a factor of three. One study found that nearly 20 percent of coronary angiographies lacked medical justification. A quarter of the surgeries to implant tubes in children's ears are inappropriate and a third are questionable.
Missed diagnoses. Unjustified surgery. Unwarranted tests. Drug mishaps. How can this medical mayhem be avoided?
For starters, we need choice -- the leeway to pick the physicians, hospitals and health plans and clinics that do the best job treating patients in our communities. Most people, including Federal employees, Medicare enrollees and employees of large businesses, have at least some choice of health plans and doctors. (Employees at smaller firms often have none, a problem that should be addressed by Congress.) But choice alone does little good if we can't distinguish excellent from mediocre, let alone atrocious. Most of us know more about the effectiveness of our deodorants than we do about the competence of our surgeons.
So how can we choose the best quality?
Such choice is not provided by various versions of a patient "bill of rights," now before Congress. A package of consumer protections is a useful though limited idea that would give people in managed-care plans some peace of mind, but it barely touches the scandal of mediocre medicine. After all, the statistics just cited are drawn largely from studies of patients in traditional fee-for-service plans. And even for patients in managed care, the bill's most potent element is merely a right of appeal if a health plan refuses to pay for a doctor-prescribed treatment.
The right of appeal would improve medical practice in isolated cases. But it would do nothing to protect patients from doctors who prescribe the wrong drugs or surgeons who perform needless and potentially risky operations. What patients really need is a right to information. Providing it would transform health care by putting patients in control, rather than doctors and insurance companies. In fact, outside Washington there are important projects under way that are on the verge of handing Americans a report card on health plans -- the tool that enables patients to guard the quality of their health care.
In Boston, Dr. Lucian L. Leape of the Harvard School of Public Health is studying how physicians and health plans can cut down on mistakes. Drug mishaps injure more than 220,000 hospital patients a year. Leape's powerful point is that these mistakes can be significantly reduced if hospitals adopt simple procedures. One of these is "unit dosing," in which hospital pharmacists would prepare injections in advance, before a patient suffers cardiac arrest and a nurse scrambles to draw the precise amount of a potent drug. Some hospitals and clinics have adopted this precaution. The scandal is that others have not.
In Los Angeles, Dr. Robert H. Brook of the Rand Corporation and the University of California at Los Angeles has developed criteria for determining when medical procedures -- like coronary bypass surgery, mastectomies and hysterectomies -- are appropriate and when they are ineffective or needlessly risky. Brook's work is the source of many of the statistics given at the beginning of this article, and it could tell physicians and health plans how best to practice medicine if they would listen. But few do. The doctors who perform unwarranted treatments are rarely incompetent, let alone villainous. Their decisions are more often based on habit and presumption. In a sensible system, decisions would be solidly rooted in Brook's clinical evidence.
In New York, a state agency rates the performance of cardiac surgeons with an increasingly sophisticated method that adjusts for the severity of the patients' condition. And in Boston, Dr. Troyen Brennan of Harvard Medical School organizes an evening seminar for a small group of colleagues on the latest advances in treating asthmatics. The seminar is part of his two-year program to evaluate overall health care at 11 outpatient clinics associated with Harvard. Brennan sends nurses into the clinics to examine a random sample of patient records and determine, according to a detailed questionnaire, whether patient care conforms to the highest standards set by Leape, Brook and others. Do the clinics, as one seminar guest recommended, teach asthmatics to use "peak flow" meters that gauge their lung performance? Do the clinics administer the proper vaccines, perform diagnostic blood tests, offer nutritional advice and teach how to examine breasts and prostate glands for early signs of cancer? Do doctors spend enough time with patients, and are patients satisfied?
The key to Brennan's evaluation is a detailed examination of patient records -- a strategy developed 10 years earlier by another Harvard team that uncovered startling amounts of malpractice in New York State hospitals. Brennan's task is harder because he is documenting not only when doctors err but also when they excel.
Grading clinics is a first step to the more important task of grading health plans and the medical groups -- the networks of doctors and hospitals that treat patients as a team -- that health plans increasingly make available to members. Behind a veil of ignorance, most family decisions to join Kaiser or the Blues, Aetna or Prudential is based on rumor. Rumor perpetuates mediocrity or worse.
Enter David Lansky and the Foundation for Accountability in Portland, Ore. He is taking Brennan's strategy to the next level -- by creating America's first reliable report card for health plans. The foundation will not assign grades to any specific plan. Instead, it will provide its method for grading plans to others -- the Federal Government, groups of employers, nonprofit groups like the American Association of Retired Persons or accreditation groups like the National Committee for Quality Assurance, which pioneered the development of criteria by which to rate H.M.O.'s.
The foundation's report card will assign five grades, each between 0 and 100. Grades for the "basics," "living with illness" and "changing needs" will measure the plan's success in helping patients connect with the right doctors, cope with chronic medical problems and adapt to old age and other health care transitions. The heart of the report card will be grades for the prevention and curing of illness.
The grade for prevention, building upon work of Leape and others, will indicate if the plan provides, for example, routine Pap smears, mammograms, screens for prostate and colon cancers, annual eye and foot exams for diabetics and inhalers for asthmatics. The grade for curing illness will reflect findings on appropriate care: has the plan routinely administered beta blockers after heart attacks and radiation therapy after breast-cancer lumpectomies?
The foundation also plans to grade results as well as treatment practices. Beyond doing all the right tests and procedures, has the plan kept the blood-sugar levels of its diabetics low? Has it kept its asthmatics out of hospital emergency rooms? Do patients suffering from depression remain at work? Do heart attack patients relapse? Do asthma patients actually use the peak-flow meters they are trained to use?
The foundation's initial report card will be crude. It will be based on a slim list of criteria and rely heavily on interviews with patients because such surveys are the easiest data to collect. But a complete report card also requires data on clinical practice that can come only from patient records. As yet, health plans neither routinely collect nor report clinical data for public scrutiny.
This problem cannot be solved in Los Angeles, New York or Boston. For the solution, look squarely to Washington. Congress needs to compel health plans to report data on their performance. For report cards to compare one plan with another, every plan must track the same categories. Congress can compel that too by adopting the framework provided by the foundation.
On this front, Washington finally appears headed in the right direction. Last month, President Clinton's commission on health care proposed a private agency to oversee the development of standards that could complement the work of Lansky's Foundation for Accountability. And key members of Congress have proposed legislation that would create Federal agencies for the same purpose. The Administration could give the process a dramatic boost by requiring that the health plans serving Medicare patients and Federal employees provide enrollees with a standardized account of their clinical data.
Medical disclosures along these lines dwarf in importance Congress's pending preoccupation with a patient bill of rights. The best way to raise the quality of health care is to set people like Leape and Brook loose to teach doctors what treatments work best and then set people like Lansky loose to tell patients which health plans are listening. If patients follow the grades, then only those health plans that invest in a reputation for quality will prosper -- much as the Hewlett-Packards, M.I.T.'s and Intels thrive on their reputation for excellence.
What people need to know about health care -- where to find high quality -- is knowable. Following the progression from Leape to Brook to Lansky, and with a forceful nudge from Congress, the health care report card could be published and be in consumers' hands within months, radically shifting the balance of power toward patients. Finally, medical consumers can take charge of the market, elevating high-quality plans, dooming mediocre or worse plans and, in the process, insuring that no more medical jumbo jets crash.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Shanghai

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON; SETH FAISON is chief of the Shanghai bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
Shanghai is in the middle of a huge make-over. As the largest and most cosmopolitan city in China, it often seems determined to be at the forefront of the nation's fast-changing ways. Today that means that Shanghai is undergoing a boom in construction so vast that officials like to boast that nearly one-fifth of the world's cranes are at work in their city.
Even if that is overstated, visible changes seem to appear almost every day. In the past year alone, Shanghai has opened a new Stock Exchange, completed hundreds of office buildings, and finished a complex of elevated highways that has sharply improved traffic congestion.
The financial crisis has halted work on new buildings in many Asian cities, but Shanghai seems heedless of the bust, at least so far. There is barely a corner of the city that is not plagued by round-the-clock construction, and with all-night work crews going at it, virtually no place is guaranteed silence even late at night.
For the visitor, the construction sites are making life a bit messy, but they also give the city a palpable vibrancy. Shanghai is a city on the move, as its residents are proud to tell you. Like New Yorkers, Shang hainese are undeniably the most urbane, flamboyant, sassy and arrogant residents of the country.
With a compact downtown area and a tendency toward narrow and winding streets, Shanghai is a wanderer's city. Leave the bicycles for Beijing and other places. Shanghai, like Manhattan, is best seen on foot.
Yet without conspicuous markers for north, south, east or west, it is easy for visitors to lose their orientation. One solution is to not even bother trying to keep your sense of direction: simply wander down any street that looks inviting. When too tired or lost to continue, you can hop in a cab. They are available virtually all over the city at any hour, and the address of a hotel or a next destination, written in Chinese, is all you need.
The city's main shopping streets, Nanjing Road and Huaihai Road, are good places to start any exploration. But the mazelike side streets are worth venturing into as well, with their close-up views of ordinary houses and back-street life.
 
Events
 From tomorrow until Saturday, Shanghai will play host to its First International Flower Festival. After years of treating flowers as a bourgeois waste of time, Shanghai is now welcoming more than 100 Chinese and foreign flower companies to participate in the exhibition, the largest flower show ever held in China. The Dutch tulip has been chosen as the theme flower of the festival, which will also feature several themes for floral arrangements: spring in the countryside, urban scenery and exotic flowers. Held at Changfeng, 25 Daduhe Road; (86-21) 6245-3270.
In mid-June an exhibition of recent works by the artist Tang Guo will be on display at Shanghart, one of the city's few modern art galleries. Tang, who lives in Nanjing, uses ink, earth and other materials on paper. Shangart is in the Portman Ritz-Carlton Hotel, 2/F, 1376 Nanjing West Road; (86-21) 6279-7135. Open seven days, 9 A.M. to 9 P.M.
From May 2 to June 1, the Shanghai International Arts Festival will feature a series of dance, music and theater performances. For a schedule and ticket information, contact the Shanghai Performance Advertising Company at (86-21) 6466-5938.
Among the highlights of the arts festival are a performance of Swan Lake by the National Ballet of Nancy and Lorraine, from France, May 2, 3 and 4 at the Majestic Theater, 66 Jiangning Lu; (86-21) 6466-0419.
A musical highlight on May 3 will be a performance by the Portal Jazz Quartet, a French group consisting of Michel Portal, saxophonist, Louis Sclavis, clarinetist, Francois Moutin, double bass player, and Daniel Humair, percussionist. At the Lyceum Theater, Maoming Road at Changle Road; (86-21) 6247-5572.
 
Sightseeing
 The greatest addition to Shanghai's cultural life in recent years is the Shanghai Museum, opened in October 1996, by far the most magnificent, and most magnificently displayed, collection of art in China. A striking-looking structure that took some inspiration from an ancient Chinese urn, the new museum seems to embody Shanghai's cosmopolitan nature, and it also sets a new standard for showing art in this country. The overall design, the layout of galleries and the specially built display stands all combine to enhance a visitor's appreciation of the museum's first-rate bronze, porcelain and jade collections.
From April through September the museum is exhibiting historical relics from Xinjiang Province. Chronicling China's Silk Road, the ancient trade route that exported silk and imported Buddhism, among other things, the exhibition includes ceramics, jewelry and mummies. The museum is at 201 Remin Avenue, in People's Square, (86-21) 6372-3500, and is open daily from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission: $5.
No visitor to Shanghai should miss a walk on its majestic waterfront, known as the Bund, where the buildings once run by old British banks and trading houses still dominate the view. The old tree-lined esplanade that hung over the river was replaced a few years ago with a more modern one, losing some character but gaining a better view of the bustling river traffic.
Across the Huangpu River, which feeds into the Yangtse River just 25 miles to the north, stands the Oriental Pearl Tower, a modernistic creation that at 1,400 feet is the tallest in Asia. The tower, on Lujiazui Road in the Pudong district, (86-21) 5882-8888, is well worth ascending, not only for its unparalleled view of the city but also for its flavor of the new Shanghai, both modern and tacky. It can be reached by a cross-river ferry that leaves from the Bund at Jingling Road every 10 minutes and costs 5 cents. Admission to the tower is $6.
An even better way to see the waterfront, not just the old financial houses but also the vast industrial shipyards in the area, is to take a 90-minute cruise on a riverboat that departs from the Bund twice a day (10:45 A.M. and 3:15 P.M.) and costs $3. Tickets are best bought a day in advance from the Shanghai Huangpu River Guide Company, at 239 Zhongshan Dongyi Road, (86-21) 6374-4461.
A dozen blocks south of the Bund is the Old City, which remained under Chinese control in the days when the English and French and Japanese carved out their own concessions. The narrow and crowded streets preserve an air of old Shanghai, and give way to a central area known as Yu Yuan, a classical Chinese garden. At its core is the Huxinting Tea House, standing in the middle of a rectangular pool, and a lovely spot for afternoon tea. For $3 you get a choice of Chinese teas, a selection of several traditional snacks and a view of the crowded garden.
 
Where to Stay
 A flavor of old Shanghai can be found in the Ruijin Guest House, 118 Ruijin Second Road, (86-21) 6472-5222, fax (86-21) 6473-2277. The grounds of what was once an elegant mansion have been kept up well, in a quiet and secluded part of town, and one can easily spend a sunny afternoon lounging on the well-manicured lawns, sipping lemonade. Its 100 rooms cost $75 to $125.
The Metropole, at 180 Jiangxi Road, (86-21) 6321-3030, fax (86-21) 6321-7365, downtown near the Bund, has an ornate lobby that seems to capture the mood of cosmopolitan Shanghai left over from the colonial era. It has a charming, dark wood-paneled bar, but its 120 rooms are plain. They cost $50 to $75.
Budget: The 120-room Qingnian Hui Hotel, at 123 Xizang Road, (86-21) 6326-1040, fax (86-21) 6320-1957, is centrally, if noisily, located on a crowded shopping street in the downtown area. Housed in the building that was once home to Shanghai's Y.M.C.A., it is also known as the Y.M.C.A. Hotel. A second-floor ballroom is home to daily ballroom dances populated mostly by a charming clientele of retirees. Its rooms cost $40 to $60.
The Pujiang Hotel at, 15 Huangpu Road, (86-21) 6324-6388, fax (86-21) 6324-3179, is nicely situated just off the Bund and across the street from the Russian Consulate. Until last year its ballroom was home to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Called the Astor Hotel before 1949, the Pujiang retains a flavor of old Shanghai with wooden floors and high ceilings. Its 80 rooms cost $40 to $60.
Luxury. The newest addition to Shanghai's growing collection of first-class hotels is the Regal Hotel, 516 Hengshan Road, (86-21) 6415-5888, fax (86-21) 6445-8899, in the part of the city ruled by French authorities -- with their own police force, bureaucrats and tax collectors -- before World War II. The Regal is a gleaming glass-and-marble concoction with all the modern comforts, including the city's best health club. There are 200 rooms, from $140 to $350 a night.
Down by the waterfront, the most magnificent of Shanghai's pre-revolution hotels is the Peace Hotel, 20 Nanjing East Road, (86-21) 6321-6888, fax (86-21) 6320-0300. Recently renovated, it has a stately Art Deco lobby and bone-and-walnut decor. A jazz band of elderly gentlemen still plays in the ground-floor bar each evening. Its 280 rooms cost $120 to $350, and the ornate Chinese restaurant on the eighth floor has a grand view of the harbor.
 
Where to Eat
 Green Willow Village, in the heart of Shanghai's shopping district at 763 Nanjing West Road, (86-21) 6258-4422, is one of the city's oldest and most distinctive restaurants, known as Luyang Cun in Chinese. Decorated in a simple, old-fashioned style, it offers a Yangzhou cuisine famous for its Mandarin fish in pine nuts, prawns in hot chili sauce, and soft-shelled turtle with dried orange peel. A four-course meal for two will cost about $40 (including beer; wine is not available).
For more traditional Shanghai fare, try Lao Ban Zhai, 596 Hankou Road, (86-21) 6322-3668, with such specialties as steamed long-tail fish in anchovy sauce, and pork meatballs cooked with crabmeat. The shredded Hainan chicken with sliced bean curd is also worth a try. A four-course dinner for two is $25 to $30, including beer.
For a cozy, fashionable seafood restaurant frequented by Shanghai's younger set, go to Lulu's, at 69 Shimen First Road, (86-21) 6258-5645, where the waiters ask you to pick your seafood while it is still swimming in one of the freshwater tanks that line the entranceway. Big yellow fish is particularly good, as are the fresh crab and eel. Sweet lotus root is an excellent appetizer. Dinner for two, with beer, is $40.
A more typically popular Shanghai dining experience awaits customers at Tin Tin Seafood Restaurant, 807 Julu Road, (86-21) 6247-2362. At one end of a large, noisy dining room, a stage show includes heavily sequined singers of Chinese pop songs. While you listen and watch, try the stir-fried river shrimp or bullhead fish in brown sauce. Twisted beancurd with pork is also quite good. Dinner for two, with beer, is $30.
A small street lined with restaurants, called Huang He Road, just around the corner from the Park Hotel, offers an array of choices for the adventurous. One of the city's best vegetarian restaurants, Gong De Lin, is there at No. 43; (86-21) 6327-0218. The pea greens with garlic are excellent, as is the resembling-chicken tofu, which is indeed tofu prepared to look like chicken. Dinner for two, with beer, is $50.

HEADLINE: Facing West on China's Silk Road

BYLINE: By PETE HESSLER; PETE HESSLER is a teacher and writer living in Fuling, China.

 BODY:
THE train left Xian late on a warm evening last August, rocking gently past the Ming Dynasty city wall. The ancient wall was the last thing I saw before going to bed, and then in the morning, we were in the dry loess hills of southern Gansu Province, where steep terraced slopes crumbled away into dusty gorges. There were walls here, too -- simple walls of packed earth that formed neat rectangles around tile-roofed houses. But something in the rugged landscape made the walls seem desperate in comparison with the grandeur of the Xian city wall.
Xian means Western Peace, and from there, the train was following the Silk Road west -- west of western peace, to the deserts of Xinjiang Province and its capital, Urumqi, in the far reaches of China. It was a well-worn route. For more than 2,000 years, it has seen travelers of all sorts: Chinese silk traders, Uighurs, Huns, Mongols, Kazakhs, Buddhist pilgrims, Islamic priests, Nestorian Christians. Some of the travelers, like Marco Polo, had been welcomed; others had met with walls of one sort or another. There is no other part of China where history speaks so vividly of the country's fitful contacts with the outside world. 
 I could sense this history even in the comfortably crowded Car 13 of the hard-sleeper class, because I was the only foreigner -- and an American to boot. Americans came late to the Silk Road, but a year in China had taught me that no other foreigners weighed so heavily on the consciousness of today's Chinese.
"All Chinese like Americans," a young man said. He was 25, from Hebei Province, working in safety management for a Xinjiang oil company, and we had been talking for half an hour when he shifted to politics.
"Many Americans think there are problems with human rights here," he said. "In fact, Old Hundred Names doesn't care about that." It was a traditional term for the common man, a reference to the fact that Chinese surnames are few.
"Old Hundred Names worries about eating, about clothes," he went on. "Look out there." I did -- a dusty village, garbage beside the tracks, a skinny donkey followed by peasants in blue. Old Hundred Names. "Do you think those people worry about democracy?" he said. "They need to improve their living standard and then they can start thinking about other things."
I saved my responses for simpler questions -- the money questions -- which came in a steady stream from passengers who stopped by to chat as the scenery slipped past: What's your salary? How much are those boots? That watch? What are the unemployment benefits in America?
We passed Lanzhou, the muddy Yellow River sluggish under a sheet of haze, and then in the afternoon a fertilizer salesman sat next to me. How much is a new car in America? he wondered. A used car? What about the license fee? Taxes? Insurance? He scrawled my responses -- guesses, all of them -- in a notebook, and then he paused to look out the window.
"My parents came to Xinjiang in the 1950's, after Liberation," he said. "They came to help build the country. It was like America."
Both of us stared outside: a shepherd with his flock in a green field, a man in blue riding a bicycle along a dusty road, a row of mud houses surrounded by walls, a range of craggy white peaks to the south, and westward, a broad empty horizon of the sort one rarely sees in China. There were no trees for miles. "Go west, young man," the fertilizer salesman said.
 SOMETIME during the second night, the train passed Jiayuguan, the westernmost fort of the Great Wall. I couldn't see that barrier, but still in the morning it was clear that a line had been crossed. There were no villages or walls, only rocks and dust and low rugged hills that were sharply shadowed by the bright desert sun.
"Forty percent of the shoes in America are made in China," a 27-year-old soldier on the way to his post in Kashgar, 60 miles from the Kyrgyzstan border, told me. I had no idea where he had acquired this fact, but he spoke with authority.
"That's why Clinton wanted the most-favored-nation status for China," he opined. "But Congress was against it. Every year they have the debate, but the Americans want to buy Chinese products."
I remembered what people had told me before I came to China: the Chinese are afraid to talk about politics with foreigners. Had this really been true in the past? It was hard for me to imagine, because it seemed they liked to talk about nothing else, except prices. And did soldiers in other countries worry about international trade?
Meanwhile, the train grew hotter as we moved into Xinjiang and the Taklimakan Desert. The hills dropped steadily, and with them the clear sky fell lower and lower, until at last, the land was perfectly flat and the horizon sat like a great dome of blue stretched taut above the black earth.
We stopped for an hour in the oasis city of Hami, where the station signs were in Arabic script as well as Chinese. Xinjiang is also called the Uighur Autonomous Region, but in recent years, the Uighurs, an indigenous Islamic minority group who constitute nearly half of the province's population, have complained that their autonomy is being diluted by waves of Han Chinese immigrants sent west by the Government. The Uighurs say that Chinese settlers receive the best jobs in Xinjiang as well as the bulk of its political power, and this dissatisfaction has led to outbreaks of violence.
There weren't any Uighurs in our car, and even at the Hami station, there were only a few, selling grapes and Hami melons beside the tracks. During the stop I asked the oil worker if any Uighurs worked in his department, and he shook his head. He admitted that Chinese-Uighur relations in Urumqi were strained, and then he shrugged.
I asked him if he could speak Uighur, and he laughed. "You don't need it," he said. "At work, when you go shopping -- always you use Chinese. But I know a few words. Salaam aleikum is 'hello.' And 'thank you' is ----." He paused, thinking hard. He had lived in the region for two years. "I forget," he said at last. "But I know 'good bye.' "
And he said it, but he spoke softly and the word was lost in the hot desert wind.
THE oasis towns appeared every hour or two, rising suddenly along the tracks, then disappearing just as quickly into the rock and dirt and sand. They weren't oases in the classic sense: no palms or shining pools of water; just concrete and glass and dust. It was as if they had been reversed, the oases and the desert; we would roll out of town and I would breathe a sigh of relief, unable to imagine that these places had once been inviting to travelers. The land was barren but it was also mesmerizing, and the towns had no charm.
I would have been happy to continue for days, passing from oasis to oasis, watching the great nothingness beside the tracks. The train was comfortable and the people friendly; all day long they brought me food and drink -- tomatoes, cucumbers, flavored ices, dried fish, beer. Occasionally, somebody stopped by to talk about prices or Chinese-American relations, but at last, it was as if the wasteland had swallowed all conversation. Nearly everybody sat silent, staring out at the scenery.
The Flaming Mountains rose to the north, red and scarred by countless ridges, and then the Tian Shan range came into view. Snow was streaked bright in the high peaks. It grew dark; a full moon hung in the eastern sky.
The train rocked westward. It seemed we'd never get to Urumqi, but I didn't care. There weren't any walls for miles and miles.

Asia Lures Travelers With Bargains

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL; EDWIN McDOWELL, a business reporter for The Times, covers the travel industry.

 BODY:
ASIA'S recent economic woes have made much of that region a bargain again, with air fares, hotel rates and package tours lower than they have been in years.
Tourism in Asia is down, and hoteliers in Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia (including Bali), Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines are desperate to raise their occupancy rates. The only way they can do so is by offering bargains. The Korean National Tourist Office, which acknowledges that the country is relying heavily on foreign tourists -- especially Americans -- to fill their rooms, noted that rates now average $166.78, down from $261.48 on Oct. 31. 
 Hotels affiliated with international chains have been the most reluctant to cut room rates, because, as a Hyatt International official said, "it's always hard to get them back up again." While holding the line on rates, Hyatt is discounting food prices in its hotels -- and suggests visiting its Web page, www.hyatt.com, for up-to-the-minute specials. Other chain hotels are offering upgrades, as well as free breakfast, free tours, free local phone calls and transportation to or from the airport. Many such bargains are bundled within package deals.
By contrast, Hong Kong-based Century International Hotels, with some two dozen hotels in seven Asian nations, is offering rates through May that average more than 50 percent off. A room at the Century Park Hotel in Bangkok is now as low as $39, compared with a published rate of $126.
Many bargains are noted below, and more are quite likely to follow, since the crisis may last anywhere from 18 months (according to the chairman of Cathay Pacific Airways) to three years (World Tourism Organization). But caveats are in order:
Seats for many inexpensive flights are limited, nonrefundable, do not include frequent-flier miles and must be paid by check or cash. Hotel rates do not include taxes or service charges and, because of fluctuating exchange rates, may be higher or lower at checkout.
Moreover, getting the lowest hotel rate usually requires bypassing a country's Web site as well as a hotel chain's worldwide reservations service and booking instead directly with the hotel (by phone in advance, or in person after arrival), with local travel agencies or with tour operators.
Finally, be aware that the posted rate (or rack rate) is, like an automobile sticker price, usually just an approximation. According to the Pacific Asia Travel Association, for example, Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts said that only 3 percent of its customers paid the rack rate, and there is no reason to think it is much different at other upscale hotels, in Asia or elsewhere.
So keep in mind that "50 percent off" may be 50 percent off a rate almost no one is paying.
 
Air Fares
In the Asia-Pacific region, air fares fell 12 to 14 percent in dollar terms in the year ended last month, according to American Express, although those same fares actually rose almost 3 percent when bought in local currencies.

THAILAND -- Late last year, the Thai hotel industry began quoting room rates in dollars instead of bhat, thus keeping rates high and causing an outcry from tourists, tour operators and the local press. (The Bangkok Post described it as a "dollar trap.") Eventually giving in, Thai hotels in every category are now among the best values in Asia.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Joel Gordes;
Insurers, Risk and the Global Climate

BYLINE: By ROBERT DUBROW 

 BODY:
JOEL GORDES, an energy consultant, believes that Connecticut's multibillion-dollar insurance industry has a choice: face possible financial ruin from losses due to more frequent and severe storms, droughts and wildfires or commit some of the industry's considerable resources to efforts to stem global warming.
Mr. Gordes is a consultant to Dr. Jeremy Leggett, formerly of Greenpeace International, and now of Solar Century in Britain. Dr. Leggett began the discussions about climate change between insurers and environmentalists in Europe. 
 Mr. Gordes now engages in similar discussions with Connecticut and other United States insurers, proposing products he feels would both increase insurers' bottom lines and reduce emission of climate-changing gases.
Mr. Gordes has been involved in energy-related work since 1975, when he was hired by a solar energy company in Waterbury. He was vice chairman of the Connecticut General Assembly's energy committee when he served as a State Representative from 1987 to 1991.
A lifelong Connecticut resident, Mr. Gordes, 51, lives in Colebrook. In a recent interview, he discussed global warming and the insurance industry. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. Why should the insurance industry be concerned about global warming?
A. The insurance industry is based upon stability of weather within certain types of boundaries.
There has to be an actuarial experience to be able to say, "This is what the premium should be for this property in this place." If climate is changing, the probability of risk changes, and that's not good. There could be more flooding, hail storms, intense wind storms, intense precipitation events.
Some recent research from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says that climate change may make hurricanes worse. Brushfires could become urban firestorms if they come off the ridges and go into Los Angeles.
It's going to be erratic and volatile, and that's not a great situation to base insurance premiums on.
Q. What is the magnitude of losses from these kinds of events?
A. If Hurricane Andrew had hit a more populated and wealthy area, like Miami, it would have been a $50 billion loss rather than the $16.5 billion loss it was. If a similar event hit metropolitan New York, New Jersey and then went into Connecticut, it could be as much as $110 billion.
Q. Have insurance losses been increasing in the 1990's?
A. Of the 25 largest weather-related insurance losses in the United States, 21 have occurred in the past decade. There has been a remarkable increase in billion-dollar catastrophic losses. Two primary reasons are greater wealth and people building more in harm's way. However, even when you normalize for that, it appears there are other factors at work.
Q. With all the uncertainty involved in projecting the future of global climate, why should the insurance companies take this seriously?
A. Absence of certainty does not mean absence of risk. If you wake up at the end of the day and say, "What if I'm wrong, what if there really is climate change?" it may be too late by then to do anything about it. The insurance industry is the first in line to be bankrupt if climate change is real.
Q. What should the insurance industry do about climate change?
A. European insurers usually have staff climatologists on board. The United States industry, with the exception of Employers Reinsurance of Kansas, generally does not.
They need to start looking at the probabilities of what could happen. Then they can ask what they can do to help mitigate climate change that at the same time will increase their bottom line -- for instance, making their own facilities more energy efficient. They own tremendous amounts of property. It will make it lower cost to maintain, at the same time they are reducing emissions.
The other thing is reducing property-casualty losses through energy types of upgrades.
A few winters ago we had all the huge icicles, called ice dams, forming along the edges of roofs. They are caused by heat escaping from poorly insulated ceilings, melting the snow on the roof from below, the water running down over the unheated eaves, refreezing, working its way back under the shingles and causing water damage inside the home. Insulating the ceiling correctly and ventilating the air above it stops ice dams.
So here's a case where saving energy, which is saving emissions, saves future claims for the insurance industry. The insurance industry could say, "We're going to give you 10 percent off your insurance for three years, if you will insulate your ceiling."
Q. Did the insurance industry have a presence at the December global warming conference in Kyoto?
A. The European and Asian insurers certainly did, and they came out with some very, very strong statements calling for emission reductions. Even as far back as 1995, Lloyd's of London, Munich Reinsurance and Swiss Reinsurance were calling for reductions. The American industry has not been there.
Seventy-one insurers have signed a United Nations accord, pledging to consider the issues of climate change and other environmental problems in all business practices. Employers Reinsurance is the only United States company to sign.
Q. Have the European and Asian insurers been involved in encouraging energy efficiency?
A. They've gone even further. They've started to invest in renewable energy. Swiss Reinsurance has put money into a fund to help people in the third world with photovoltaics. There are a number of English insurers joining the campaign called Solar Century.
Q. Why can't insurance companies simply not insure vulnerable areas instead of trying to mitigate global warming?
A. Then you don't have much of a business. And you are going to have to have the insurer of last resort take over, which is usually the government. In the long run that usually doesn't work too well. Somebody has to pay somewhere. If you're an insurer, you calculate the risks and do your business. There are a lot of other tools they are developing to manage those risks, financial tools mostly, but that ignores what may be the biggest threat.
Q. Why can't insurance companies simply raise their rates as their response to global warming?
A. They have been doing that -- in Florida, in certain other prone areas. But remember, it's a regulated business, and the minute you start raising rates, people start squawking to their state senators and representatives and insurance commissioners. It's a politically driven process.
Q. Are there precedents for the insurance industry advocating social policy changes that would reduce risks?
A. Absolutely. What about the support they've given to Mothers Against Drunk Driving? What about seat belt safety and air bag safety? In one case they took some pension funds and invested them in businesses that created jobs for union members from whose pension funds the money came.
Why should insurance companies, if there is a solid link to climate change from fossil fuel emissions, be investing in fossil fuel projects? It's like a health insurance company investing in tobacco.
Q. What has been the response of United States insurance executives to your arguments?
A. They are, as insurers usually are, very cautious. They want to see more ironclad links before they begin to take action. However, a few are starting to make some statements, one that will be putting something in their annual report.
We've come up with certain reasons why the United States insurers have not followed in the footsteps of the European Community. The Europeans have more global exposure to losses. The Europeans do not have a massive disinformation campaign going on by their fossil fuel industry, as we do.
United States companies don't want to scare their stockholders and customers by saying climate change is imminent. Many also sell auto insurance. And one of the things we're going to have to do, if we want to stop emissions, is get a lot of people out of their autos.
Q. How important is this issue for Connecticut?
A. Connecticut's economy is still heavily invested in the insurance industry. Some statements were made by Republican State Chairman Chris DePino about how Democratic Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's support for climate change legislation and the Kyoto treaty holds a risk for him. I don't think the Republican chairman has reckoned with the threat that climate change could present to the insurance industry in his home state. So I think he's barking up the wrong tree.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION;
They Let the Talking Heads Talk, but They Set the Tone

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
IN the mists of television past, the on-screen interviewer was likely to be an anonymous scholar or an uncomfortable newspaper reporter, but by the time the rabbit ears had vanished and long before you could say "Hi, Larry!" a transformation had occurred. Tilling the fields of journalism, entertainment and hospitality, interviewers sowed a new profession: the reporter as video artist.
With the incessant and unnerving expansion of cable, the interviewers have continued to multiply. On duty at all hours, they are made-for-television inimitables, many of them more famous than most of their guests. Some carry on the journalistic mission; some wander afield into show business, celebrities tangling with celebrities. In reviewing the performances of a few of the best known of those who bring the nation some semblance of all the news all the time, we find ourselves reviewing a high-powered segment of their medium. 

THE SOPHISTICATE
Ted Koppel, "Nightline"
Mr. Koppel is distinguished by his know-it-all air. He winks at his audience as he dares his eminent guests to outwit him: "Mr. Berger, take a crack at the question that I put to Secretary Albright and which she evaded so skillfully." It's the smartest kid on the block against all comers.
Not long ago he twitted a Los Angeles police officer on the subject of symptoms of biological terrorism: "Everyone with a stuffy nose and a headache is now going to think, 'Oh, my God, that could be a biological weapon.' "
Yet he is not frivolous. He is a close listener with a knack for interpreting officials' words in a way they did not intend. After listening to a somewhat muddled explication about the prospects for Iraq by the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Koppel clarified: "So Unscom" -- the United Nations inspection team -- "can't do its job now, won't be able to do its job after a bombing, I think we're agreed, right?" Mr. Berger did not improve his position by falling back on the Administration mantra: "It's up to Saddam Hussein. It's up to Saddam Hussein."
After listening to William S. Cohen, Secretary of Defense, go on about the need to bomb Iraq in order to send a signal to Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Libya, Mr. Koppel passed the ball to the Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright.
"And now," he said, "if I'm hearing Secretary Cohen directly, we are holding out the possibility of perhaps bombing Iran, North Korea----"
"No!" broke in Ms. Albright.
"No! No! You are wrong!" broke in Mr. Cohen.
It's the sort of question, a touch unfair perhaps, that compels his guests to sort out approximately what their talking points mean.

Having established himself in the late-night spot on the PBS schedule, Mr. Rose provides a Vanity Fair of television, a mix of business and show business, art and politics, and personalities around town. His range is upscale by television standards. In a recent stretch, he supplied viewers with Anna Quindlen, the writer; Gary Oldman, the actor; Tom Peters, the business guru; Dr. Angela Christiano, the hair researcher; Joan Sutherland, the singer; Thomas Hoving, the former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Nathan Myhrvold of Microsoft. The rumpled air that goes with Mr. Rose's North Carolina accent somehow connects his guests with his audience.
Over the years, it seems to me, our nighttime Charlie has learned to listen more and fawn less. He still slips into flattery (proclaiming Joan Sutherland "the unparalleled operatic voice of the century" and introducing the actor Rupert Everett as "known for stealing audiences' hearts"), but he usually stops before he melts away.
One can quarrel with some of his subjects. Some viewers might have done without his unproductive dippings into the Monica Lewinsky stew, as if there were a shortage of that stuff on less fastidious channels. But he makes up for such lapses with reasonably adult conversations on heavy matters like the Asian economic crisis (led by Henry A. Kissinger and Richard C. Holbrooke) and gay rights.
Both those panels might have benefited from more difference of opinion among the panelists, especially the Kissinger team, lockstep boosters of the International Monetary Fund. But Mr. Rose, a born courtier, deserves some credit amid the talk-show brouhaha for avoiding contentiousness for its own sake. And this particular program produced a startling sentence from Mr. Kissinger: "I have no independent opinion." Now that's something you don't often hear on the tube.
 
THE GREETER
Larry King, "Larry King Live"
If at heart Charlie Rose wants to run a salon, Larry King wants to tend bar. He'll bend an elbow with any headliner who'll join him, serving up every brand of journalism lite. If fortune had taken Mr. King in a slightly different direction, he might have wound up as a political-machine glad-hander, with a big greeting to the world and an arm around the audience, which he admonishes, "Don't go away!" before each commercial break. For ambitious politicians, new-book authors, movie stars, publicity seekers of every breed, he provides a compliment, a blurb.
Depth is not Mr. King's strong suit. Popping restlessly from guest to guest, from call-in to call-in, he plays to limited attention spans. He's streetwise, operating down there somewhere between Barbara Walters and Geraldo Rivera. When Jeff Greenfield sits in for him, the tone of the show rises notably, perhaps at the expense of its ratings.
A lot more comfortable with personalities than with issues, Mr. King isn't put off by bottom feeding. Count on your host to squeeze every bit of juice out of the misadventures of Princess Diana, Paula Jones and Marv Albert (in between appearances of Ross Perot, in whom he seems to hold stock). If you're looking for the latest on Ms. Lewinsky, trust Mr. King to come through, even if it requires resorting to characters you wouldn't depend on for the right time. He is not much for wit, but when he asks a guest, "Why should we be interested in Monica?," he is his own parody.
Mr. King is television's regular guy. He asked the upright Senator Orrin G. Hatch about goings-on in the Oval Office: "If Hillary doesn't care, why's it your business?" He is given to male-bonding cracks, for example asking Representative John Conyers Jr., a Clinton defender, whether his female interns have access to him at all hours. You'll find no superior-than-thou affectations on "Larry King Live." His inelegant frankness -- never heard, be assured, on the "Lehrer News Hour" -- is his most winning quality.
 
THE RESPECTABLES
Jim Lehrer, Elizabeth Farnsworth, Phil Ponce and Margaret Warner, "The News Hour With Jim Lehrer"
The "News Hour" stalwarts are not always the most exhilarating company, but there is no doubting the seriousness of their mission. Their collective eye is on the issues.
Although David Gergen, everybody's former adviser, adds a smattering of bookishness to the "News Hour" and some essayist can be counted on to do some sports slumming at World Series time, the nightly focus is heavily on public affairs.
The reception for Washington regulars -- Cabinet members, Congressional bigwigs and such who travel the channels -- is notable for its workmanlike journalism and good breeding. Even at times, say the recent gives and takes between partisans of the White House and the special prosecutor, when a touch of rudeness prevailed elsewhere, the Lehrer team minded its manners. No guest need fear Koppel-style wise cracks, much less Sam Donaldson-style bluster. As for the audience, Mr. Lehrer's easy-going down-home approach to weighty matters invites trust.
All interviewers are at the mercy of their interviewees, which accounts for the bouts of ennui that particularly afflict PBS, but when Mr. Lehrer comes up with with a well-chosen guest or three he makes the most of the occasion. In his questioning of several visitors from Congress during the military buildup in the Persian Gulf, he pressed cordially but pointedly on the reluctance of America's putative allies to join in an attack and what such an attack might realistically accomplish. Mr. Lehrer is a master at playing off one opinion against another without setting anybody's teeth on edge, or giving a guest an inferiority complex.
The "News Hour" band is also notable for its attention to the thinking behind such matters as lawyers' maneuverings and judges' decisions. Interviewing a guest reporter about the appointment of a special prosecutor in the Bruce Babbit case, Mr. Lehrer typically led him in a sober direction: "Take us through the process." That's not a question to stir the juices, but in the television world, illuminating the workings of the system is rarer and more daring than delivering a dose of gossip or scoring an easy point.
 
THE SUNDAY MORNING SET
Sam Donaldson, Cokie Roberts and George Will, "This Week With Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts"
Bob Schieffer, "Face the Nation"
Tim Russert, "Meet the Press"
If "This Week" seems a touch schizophrenic, attribute it to the format, which halfway through the hour transforms its stars from reporters to opinionators. See Mr. Will turn in the blink of a commercial from the cultured interviewer into the committed (or commitable) right winger, who can always find occasion to stick it to the politically correct.
Mr. Will has the excuse of a well-stocked mind, an acquaintance with American history -- he can recite the provenance, with dates, of the special prosecutor law -- and a talent for a tidily turned phrase.
His colleagues perform without such assets. No sooner does Mr. Will make a provocative comment than Mr. Donaldson is likely to ground the discussion back to the obvious or the merely noisy. In a typical outing a few weeks ago, Congress's failure to pass a Federal drunk-driving standard brought interesting perspective from Mr. Will, Bill Kristol and George Stephanopoulos. Mr. Donaldson's contribution was to wax indignant about drunks killing children. He confesses, "Usually I try to dominate."
On his Sunday show, as at White House press conferences, Mr. Donaldson lives up to his reputation for a confrontational manner and persistence in reminding a guest that he has failed to address the question. The Donaldson theme is "I'm Forever Playing Gotcha." Knowing how to put a politician or a diplomat on the spot is a useful talent, but it can also reduce a complicated issue to a yes or no.
Carried away by his ratings and self-regard, Mr. Donaldson sometimes seems to be trying out for "The Sam Donaldson Hour," where he could exclusively interview himself.
Ms. Roberts trades on her Washington connections. Insidership is not synonymous with insight, but she has plainly read the morning papers before turning up for work, and often asks the sort of questions that will have occurred to her viewers, which is flattering enough to make her an audience favorite. It was Ms. Roberts who noted last Sunday that she had never seen politicians run away from contributions as fast as the Republicans are running from the tobacco industry. Anyway, her common-sense style complements that of the erudite Mr. Will and provides relief from the bumptious Mr. Donaldson.
Their Sunday-morning competitors, Mr. Russert and Mr. Schieffer, also find themselves up against politicians given to evasion and obfuscation. Both make worthy adversaries.
Mr. Schieffer, the CBS veteran who presides on "Face the Nation," is not the most exciting television personality around, but he compensates with solid experience and a professional mien. He knows the right questions and does not show off about it. Perhaps his want of pretension saves him from professional egomania. Unlike so many television journalists, he does not operate under the assumption that he is more interesting or important than his guests.
Over on "Meet the Press," Mr. Russert brings plenty of energy and research to his interviews. Although given to sappy little jokes about his hometown or favorite sports team, he is vigorous in pursuit of a tricky prey. He can be as tough as Mr. Donaldson but is more engaging.
Like all the other Sunday morning revelers, in recent months Mr. Russert has been in thrall to the Clinton-Lewinsky-Jones triangle, but he gets more fun out of the game. The other week, in a technique he previously used to memorable effect in exposing Louis Farrakhan, he asked William H. Ginsburg, Monica Lewinsky's lawyer, to explain a series of somewhat perplexing comments he had made since becoming a television mouthpiece. What, for example, did he mean by calling the relationship between the President and his client "collegial"? The fuzzy answer only dug him deeper into confusion, which after all, is one of the pleasures of the interview shows.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Fuji the Latest Addition to Bustling Raritan Center

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
BY next January a patch of land in the 2,300-acre Raritan Center business park in Edison will be transformed into the Northeast regional office and distribution center for Fuji Photo Film U.S.A., ushering in a new stage of growth for the giant park, and by extension, the city and that area of Middlesex County.
The new 465,000-square-feet building will rise on 20 acres at King George's Post Road and Clearview Avenue within the park, which straddles Edison and neighboring Woodbridge Township. 
 Fuji, based in Tokyo with corporate offices in Elmsford, N.Y., will shut down its present smaller regional office in Carlstadt, said Robert A. Fisher, the company's director of distribution.
The company, a manufacturer and marketer of imaging and information products, will lease the new building for 10 years from the developer, Federal Business Centers, of Edison. The estimated cost of the project is more than $30 million.
At the same time, construction of an overpass at Woodbridge Avenue (Route 514) is under way, along with elimination of one traffic light and the installation of three others.
The overpass will improve access to Raritan Center, among the largest taxpayers and employment centers in central New Jersey, and relieve traffic congestion along Woodbridge Avenue.
The $20 million cost of the improvements, expected to be completed by this fall, is being borne by the county and state as part of a public-private partnership, which includes the developer, property owners and local government.
Development at Raritan Center has been at a sluggish pace for most of this decade. But since the announcement of the overpass last year a 111,973-square-foot building has been completed for Federal Express and an 89,000-square-foot, multitenant speculative building, along with Fuji's, is under way.
Once occupied by the Raritan Arsenal, the center is now half developed with 13 million square feet of occupied space and some 300 companies employing over 13,000 workers.
The traffic improvements, contemplated for over 20 years, are integral not only in attracting new businesses to the area but in retaining existing ones, said David B. Crabiel, director of the Middlesex County Board of Freeholders, citing Fuji's move to illustrate his point.
"Without them Raritan Center and that whole area would not thrive as well as we anticipate it now will," Mr. Crabiel said.
Agreeing with that assessment is Peter Viceglia, president of Federal Business Centers, which owns 1,000 acres at Raritan Center and is one of two major developers developing the park; the other is the local Summit Associates. In real estate today the key is, "transportation, transportation, transportation," Mr. Viceglia said, adding a twist to the old developer mantra.
FORMING public-private partnerships to nudge along road-improvement projects and spur development is picking up momentum throughout the state as public aid for such projects dwindles. Another example is the widening of River Road, the main artery through the Bergen County community of Edgewater and its stretch of the Hudson River waterfront.
The first two-mile leg is finished and the second, just over two miles, is under way and expected to be completed next fall, fully opening up the riverfront corridor to development, county officials said. The cost of the $19 million project is being shared by developers and the county, state and local government.
In Edison the public-private partnership works like this:
The independent Middlesex County Improvement Authority sold low-interest bonds to finance 80 percent of the $20 million cost of the overpass; the remaining 20 percent is coming from the state's Department of Transportation.
Six property owners -- including Federal Business Centers and The New York Times, which has a printing plant not far from Raritan Center along Route 514 -- donated a total of five acres of land necessary to accommodate the overpass. Federal Business Centers also contributed $750,000 to the project.
The improvement authority will receive annual payments of $4 million from the state and $1 million from the county for four years to repay the bonds, said Sarah Clarke, the authority's director of economic development. This allows us "to move forward on the project now instead of later," she said.
The authority was anxious to move quickly to take advantage of the state's strong economy, which is encouraging companies to expand, and a low vacancy for industrial space in Middlesex County, which is encouraging developers to start new projects.
In the first quarter the county's available industrial space, with uses ranging from manufacturing, to high-technology and warehousing, dropped to 16 million from 17.9 million the same time in 1997. As a result, the county's vacancy rate fell to 10.87 percent from 12.4 percent, according to CB Commercial, the national commercial brokerage firm.
The company puts the vacancy rate in the submarket in and around Edison, including Raritan Center, at 7.92 percent, down from 9.1 percent the year before. In turn, the area's average asking rents rose 25 cents per square foot per year to $5.04. "It is a vibrant market," said Robert M. Singer, first vice president at the Teaneck office of CB Commercial, which represented Fuji in the Raritan Center transaction.
EDISON, with 96,000 people in 26 square miles, is the state's sixth largest city and one of its main assets is location, said Mayor George A. Spadoro. It is accessible to a web of major highways, including the New Jersey Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway and Interstate 287.
The new overpass "will open up the flood gate to new development," Mayor Spadoro said, saying that the tax revenue generated would enable the township to maintain high employment and low taxes. "Everyone benefits," he added.
In addition to the Fuji project, construction has started or will soon start on two others in Edison outside Raritan Center. One is a three-building, 1.3 million speculative project consisting of office, warehouse and distribution space. Rising on 55 acres at the 410-acre Industrial Park at the foot of Mill Road, it is being developed by the park's owner, Heller Industrial Parks.
Jeffrey J. Milanaik the company's president said he was moving forward with the project because "space in Edison is tight, especially for blocks of 300,000 square feet or more."
The other project is a warehouse distribution center with 830,000 square feet, including office space, on 50 acres along Nixon Avenue. The developer is Reckson Morris Industrial, a partnership of the Morris Companies of Secaucus and Reckson Associates Realty Corporation of Melville, L.I., a real estate investment trust.
"Companies are growing and as they grow they are consolidating into one site from scattered locations," said Ron Schram, senior vice president for marketing and leasing at Reckson Morris. "We are catching that trend."
He said the partners would seek final approval for the project next month and expect to start construction by July.
Mr. Singer of CB Commercial said Fuji had looked for three months before deciding on the Raritan Center site, which was selected from among 20 within as well as outside of the state. "Knowing that the road improvement was to be completed with a year was an important part of that decision," he added.
"It made the location more attractive," said Mr. Fisher of Fuji, adding that the city's granting the project a five-year tax abatement also helped.
Fuji will consolidate its operations, now in two buildings in Carlstadt, together totaling 325,000 square feet, into the 465,000 square foot building in Raritan Center.
"Being under one roof," Mr. Fisher said, "will enable us to operate more efficiently." He said the new building, which Fuji has the option of expanding by 50,000 square feet, would house some 200 employees.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
A Surging Economy Revives the Hotel Industry

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
WHEN Paul F. Amoruso, president of Island Hospitality in Jericho, and his partner, H. B. Gianos, bought the 136-room Best Western in Holtsville in 1995, the $5 million they paid represented one-third of its replacement cost.
The price was low because the hotel, like several others on Long Island, had failed in the early 90's because of plummeting demand for rooms in a struggling economy. 
 Now, with a revived hotel market bringing strengthening demand and rising room rates, Island Hospitality will begin a 57-room addition on May 1 -- the first new hotel construction in Suffolk County in almost a decade. Many other developers are also re-entering the Long Island market, or are eager to do so.
"Now that we have worked our way out of losses in the defense industry, and now that the computer, telecommunications and biotechnology industries have grown," said Michael Hollander, president of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau in Hauppauge, "the need for hotel rooms has been rising, and I expect to see about 1,000 new rooms coming on line over the next three years."
New hotels will include two Extended Stay America hotels, one in Bethpage with 104 rooms on which construction is to begin in mid-May and one in Melville with 134 rooms due to start in December.
In addition, a 129-room Wingate Inn in Garden City is to start in 90 days, and a 163-room Red Roof Inn in Westbury starts in the fall. And construction is to start this summer on a 122-room Marriott Residence Inn in Islip near MacArthur Airport.
The Parkoff Organization of Great Neck plans to build a 218-room hotel and conference center in Long Beach once it has the financing. Manhattan East Suite Hotels of Manhattan is looking for a site. Urgo Butts & Company of Chevy Chase, Md., developer of the Residence Inn in Islip, is considering additional Residence Inns in Uniondale -- where it owns the 615-room Long Island Marriott -- and in Stony Brook. And Breslin Realty Development of Garden City hopes to attract a hotel to its upcoming Brookhaven Town Center mall in Yaphank.
Other hotels have undergone major renovations, or are now being upgraded. Apple Core Hotels of Manhattan, for example, is spending $2 million on improvements to the 182-room Best Western Hotel and Conference Center in Hempstead. The 360-room Wyndham Wind Watch Hotel in Hauppauge got a $1.5 million overhaul last year.
Rising room rates and occupancies are the obvious lure. At the Best Western in Holtsville, for example, income this year is 30 percent above projections, with the occupancy rate now 85 percent, up from 67 percent a year ago, said Mr. Amoruso of Island Hospitality.
"Usually when a market achieves occupancies above 70 percent it means there is unaccommodated demand, and that definitely exists in the Nassau County market," said Marie K. Laib, a senior analyst with Hospitality Valuation Services in Mineola, a hotel industry consultant.
With several developers like Breslin planning large retail and commercial projects in Suffolk, " I think we'll see moderate growth in hotel construction there as well," she added.
In 1997, the average occupancy rate on Long Island increased to 73.1 percent from 72 percent in 1996, and the average daily room rate increased to $96.79 from $89.66, according to Smith Travel Research of Hendersonville, Tenn., an independent research firm that tracks hotel-industry performance and surveys hotels with 20 or more rooms.
There actually has been a shrinkage over the last six years in the number of rooms available on Long Island, said Chuck Ross, the company's vice president. In 1992 there were 120 properties with 10,900 rooms; in 1997 there were 118 with 10,500 rooms, he noted.
Analysts say that new growth is being stifled by the difficulty of developing on Long Island. "Zoning and environmental laws make it tougher to build on Long Island and in Manhattan than in 98 percent of the rest of the country," said Michael J. Rietbrock, a senior lodging analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
Manhattan East Suite Hotels has been looking for a site on Long Island for well over a year, said Daniel J. Denihan, one of the partners in the company, which owns and operates 10 hotels in Manhattan.
SHOULD its search be successful, the hotel chain will join others in bringing a relatively new concept to Long Island -- accommodations that have kitchenettes so that they can cater to the traveler who stays a week or more.
Marriott Residence Inns was one of the early pioneers of the concept, but its room rates are equivalent to, or even exceed, those in full-service hotels. The 160-room Residence Inn in Plainview, which is owned and operated by Urgo Butts, has until now had the extended-stay market on Long Island to itself.
Now with Extended Stay America of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., planning to complete both of its hotels over the next 13 months, the budget-conscious traveler will have a less costly option. Room rates at its Long Island hotels are expected to be in the range of $199 to $299 a week, compared with about $1,113 to $2,275 a week charged by the Residence Inn in Plainview.
Extended Stay America, whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, is a three-year-old company that already owns and operates 218 properties nationwide and has 75 under construction. To maintain its room rates in a range of $159 to $399 a week -- with the variation depending on geographic area and services offered -- amenities are kept to a minimum. There are no restaurants and usually no pools. Front desks close at 11 P.M. Housekeeping is an extra charge.
The 104-room Bethpage facility, which is to be built on a 2.6-acre site on South Oyster Bay Road that was formerly part of the Northrop Grumman complex, is expected to open in December. The 136-room hotel in Melville, expected to open in May 1999, will be built on a 4.9-acre site on Spagnoli Road, off Route 110.
Extended-stay hotels "are a tremendous growth area though they currently represent only 2 percent of all the rooms in the United States," said Mr. Ross of Smith Travel Research.
He said that Long Island, with its switch from the military industry to high technology, would probably be a good market for these types of accommodations, because high technology draws trainees and consultants who want to stay for a longer period.
Still, more traditional hotels are also coming to Long Island, including the 129-room Wingate Inn, to be built on a two-acre site on Stewart Avenue and South Street in Garden City. It will cater to the business traveler by offering a business center with facsimile machines, printers, copiers and other equipment along with meeting rooms. Individual rooms will have computer hookups and voice mail. Wingate Inns of Parsippany, N.J. is a three-year-old chain that has 28 hotels in operation throughout the country.
The Garden City project, where room rates will be about $90 a day, is being developed by a joint venture of the Albanese Development Corporation and Albert L. Salvatico, a private investor, both of Garden City. The five-story hotel was designed by Ronald Schmidt & Associates of Englewood, N.J.
The hotel will be entering an underserved market, said Russell G. Matthews, the executive vice president of Albanese, noting that central Nassau contains millions of square feet of office and retail space. Hofstra University and Nassau Community College add to the demand for hotel space and spillover demand is also coming from Manhattan, he said. Yet only two major hotels, the Marriott in Uniondale and the 280-room Garden City Hotel, serve the area.
However, a 163-room Red Roof Inn will also start construction this year on a three-acre site not far from the Wingate, which is on the former Roosevelt Raceway property in Westbury. Red Roof Inns is leasing the parcel from MCS Realty Partners of Manhattan, which has built 600,000 square feet of retail space on another portion of the former Raceway site.
Red Roof, based in Hilliard, Ohio, has 260 properties in 35 states and the District of Columbia, and is in the economy category, with daily room rates of $45 to around $100. It offers business amenities but no pools or health clubs. The company is looking for several other sites on Long Island in addition to the one in Westbury, said Gail B. Whitcomb, a senior vice president.
Although developers are optimistic that Long Island's hotel market will not become oversaturated despite all the new projects and proposals, others recommend some caution.
"I agree that the outlook is good, but in any market you have to be careful of overbuilding and Long Island is no exception," said Ms. Laib of Hospitality Valuation Services.

HEADLINE: Indian Nations Wary of Restrictions on Tobacco

BYLINE: By MARY REINHOLZ 

 BODY:
TO get to Chief Harry B. Wallace's Smoke Shop and Trading Post, you have to drive over the railroad tracks in Mastic and wind through a maze of suburban streets until you reach a dirt road on the Poospatuck Reservation.
Signs leading to the rustic store advertise prices for tax-free cigarette brands, the only industry in this quiet low-income enclave of 250 Native Americans. 
 Even in the pouring rain on a recent weekday, there was a steady trickle of customers entering Indian land in Suffolk County to buy cigarettes at the shop, one of three owned by tribal entrepreneurs selling tobacco and other products on the wooded 55-acre property that is part of the Unkechaug nation.
"I'm addicted and know I'm going to die from smoking, but I'm on a fixed income and these save me money," said Bob Rozycki, 52, of Ridge, who said he buys about five cartons of Marlboros there a month.
Mr. Rozycki figures he saves at least $5 on each carton. Marlboros were on sale that day at $15.75 each, reduced from about $18.25. If state sales taxes were included, they would go for about $23 to $24 each. A carton bearing the name Omaha, the first brand made at a reservation in Nebraska and distributed by Mr. Wallace in New York, was selling for $9.75.
Mr. Wallace, a Dartmouth graduate, is a New York City lawyer who relocated to the Poospatuck reservation in 1991 and started his successful business from a trailer on his mother's property. He has done so well with his business that he has built, besides his current store, a two-story house.
Mr. Wallace smoked during an interview at his nearby law office, puffing on an Omaha that he contends is less addictive than non-Indian cigarettes.
"No one denies that cigarettes are bad for your health," he said. But the major tobacco companies have made it exceedingly worse by the addition of preservatives and additives. You have to understand that Native people have always had tobacco. We're trying to bring tobacco back to a more non-abusive use. That's what the Omaha people are doing. We are abeing punished for the bad acts of other people."
Mr. Wallace said the anti-tobacco legislation, if enacted, would put a dent in the fragile economy of the Poospatuck reservation "because all but four people" are employed in some fashion as a result ofthe three smoke shops.
Of course, the price of all cigarettes across America will be sharply increased, forced up to $1.10 extra a pack by the year 2003, should the recent landmark anti-tobacco legislation get voted into law by both houses of Congress.
The legislation was introduced by Senator John D. McCain, Republican of Arizona, and passed 19-1 by the Commerce Committee that he chairs. It has strong bipartisan support despite the fact that the major cigarette manfacturers have said they will not cooperate with the new legislation, saying it would put them out of business.
Mr. McCain's bill contains provisions about the sale of cigarettes on tribal land and considers tribes as states for the purposes of eligibility for public health funding to treat tobacco-related illnesses.
According to Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Republican of Colorado and chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, "The Senate tobacco legislation protects traditional and ceremonial uses of tobacco and respects tribal authority to make and enforce laws on Indian lands."
Nonetheless, Mr. Wallace, who is also president of the Long Island Native American Business Association, is concerned that the Federal Government will require states to impose taxes on reservations that sell tobacco to non-Indians despite tribal sovereignty -- an issue that New York's reservations won last year after a bitter showdown with Gov. George E. Pataki.
There are nine Indian nations in New York. Two Long Island reservations have smoke shops selling tobacco without state sales taxes: the Poospatuck, one of two New York tribes that had refused to sign any tax compact with the state, and the Shinnecock reservation in Southampton, which also has three smoke shops operated by Native Americans. Mr. Wallace does not quibble with efforts by Federal legislators to curtail teen-age smoking, which Senator Campbell has described as at an 80 percent level on Indian reservations and tobacco use there in general at "crisis levels."
But the chief said he was prepared to go to Washington -- "en masse, if necessary" -- to lobby against an amendment to the McCain bill, introduced by Senator Slate Gorton, a Republican from Washington.
The amendment, passed by a 10-9 vote, specifies that tribes "or tribal corporations" shall collect any excise or sales tax imposed by a state within the exterior borders where the sale occurs on "non-members of the Indian tribe" who buy tobacco products. In turn, the amendment provides, the taxes would be remitted to the Treasurer of the United States who would remit them to the state where the transaction took place.
"This is a continuation of Senator Gorton's agenda, which is to abrogate totally our treaty rights and destroy the sovereignty of Indians," Mr. Wallace said. "What does he want -- to have people marked with some kind of designation? If this bill is passed in its current form it could halt Native American economic development dead in its tracks."
Because of treaty rights, states are generally barred from enforcing state laws and taxes on tribes. Indeed, a spokeswoman for Senator McCain said he opposed the Gorton amendment "because he opposes any state taxation on tribal lands because of the longstanding Federal law that tribal lands are tax exempt."
Mr. Wallace, noting that New York has no law prohibiting Indian sales to non-Indians, noted, "That's the precise issue of sovereignty Governor Pataki has said will be respected for Indian nations."
Last year Mr. Pataki abandoned his attempt to collect taxes on cigarettes and gasoline sold on Indian reservations to non-Indians, estimated by state officials at about $100 million a year. At one point the New York Department of Taxation and Finance had seized trucks with shipments bound to reservations to insure they were in compliance with a department tax regulation, said a department spoksman, Kevin Quinn.
Protests erupted as 1,000 Native Americans and their supporters blocked traffic along a 30-mile stretch of the New York State Thruway near Buffalo, burning tires and clashing with state troopers.
Mr. Quinn said that because of smoke caused by the tire burning, a car passenger was killed in a collision with a tractor trailer.
Last May 22, in a drastic policy shift, Mr. Pataki asked the Department of Taxation and Finance to repeal the tax regulation. Today, said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, "The Governor's position is that nations should have the right to control over their own economy. This has been a tradition in New York for centuries."
But the issue, which also plagued Mr. Pataki's Democratic predecessor, Mario Cuomo, remains a complex one. Last year the New York Association of Convenience Stores sued the State Department of Taxation and Finance in an effort to compel it to enforce the very regulation the agency is now trying to repeal. The case is before the New York Court of Appeals in Albany, the highest court in the state.
Meanwhile, said Mr. Quinn, the Governor is looking into legislation that would exempt Indians from collecting taxes from the sales of tobacco or motor fuel purchased by non-Indians.
James B. Crane 2d, a lawyer whose Albany firm is pressing the lawsuit on behalf of the New York Association of Convenience Stores, contends "that Native Americans have historically used sovereignty as a shield in a prophylactic fashion," adding, "It's a nice buzz word, but sovereignty is a limited doctrine."
Mr. Crane said that the National Association of Convenience Stores "is looking to New York to develop a methodology that respects Native American sovereignty but also results in having taxes collected and thereby leveling the economic playing field." He added: "It's not just a problem in New York, it's a problem in about 18 other states."
The problem for non-Indian tobacco merchants translates to unfair competition, said Michael Cuomo, owner of Mike's One Stop Shop, a convenience store in Mastic Beach. Mr. Cuomo (no relation to the former Governor) said that he once owned a successful smoke shop across the street from his convenience store but it lost "80 percent" of its sales after Mr. Wallace began selling tax-free tobacco on the nearby Poospatuck Reservation in 1992.
"One of the problems for retailers is the unfair competition and the fact that the government permits tax evasion on a mass level," Mr. Cuomosaid. "I respect Indian sovereignty but the tribes don't benefit from the money being made at retail locations -- only the entrepreneurs. Mr. Pataki and his predecessors have chosen to make public policy based on anarchy and threats of violence at the reservations as opposed to the rule of law."
Last month, Assemblyman Jeffrey Klein, Democrat of the Bronx, charged that Indian reservations in New York were becoming spawning grounds for cigarette bootlegging.
"Someone can pull up with a van and buy 250 cartons a day," he said, "and sell them in a day all over the city on the black market."
"That's absurd," Mr. Wallace responded when informed of the allegation. "I don't known what evidence he has, but it's already been established that the overwhelming bulk of transactions are legitimate and for personal use."
John Dossett, general counsel for the National Congress of American Indians in Washington, said there were 1.5 million people living on Indian reservations in America and "hundreds" of compacts and agreements that Indian tribal governments across the country have worked out for collection of state taxes.
"Some of the compacts are written so the tribe collects the taxes and remits to the state based on a formula of how many people live in an area compared to the non-Indians," he said.
"In other states," Mr. Dossett noted, "the tribe collects and keeps the taxes to run the schools and bridges. Indian tribes have a 31 percent poverty rate on Indian reservations and a 56 unemployment rate, according to 1990 census figures. So the amount of economic deprivation is incredible. Indian tribes have been trying their hands at all kinds of economic development."
Mr. Wallace will not disclose annual volume sales on tobacco products bought at his store, but he says that the three tribal smoke shops together employ "directly or indirectly" most of the adults on the reservation, many of whom, he said, had previously been on welfare and other forms of public assistance. He added that the smoke shop "makes direct surcharge payments to the nation for the licensing privilege to operate."
Elected chief for five successive one-year terms, Mr. Wallace went to Dartmouth as an undergraduate on a full scholarship. His wife, Margo ThunderBird, a Shinnecock, has joined him in converting his former smoke shop into a community cultural center where, he said, children are taught the language of the Unkechaug nation.
Mr. Wallace, who also manages reservation programs such as a food bank and summer youth projects, said that he knew he would encounter resistance when he first started his smoke shop after receiving approval from the seven-member tribal council.
But he added: "I didn't realize the extent of the resistance back then. My background as an attorney enabled me to withstand some of the negative onslaught we got from some folks. I got death threats from people who would say, 'If you continue to run this, I'm going to blow your place up.' "
Asked why a Native American merchant would be the target of such hatred, Mr. Wallace didn't hesitate in his reply. "Because we're supposed to be impoverished," he said, "to subsist within a welfare economy and not succeed in any way shape or form. That makes it complacent and keeps the status quo."

HEADLINE: Change Is Part of Temporary Worker's Job

BYLINE: By ROBIN F. DeMATTIA 

 BODY:
NIKE OTUYELU of New Rochelle, who is studying for a master's degree in management at Baruch College in Manhattan, needs money for expenses like almost any student. She found the solution as an office temporary, taking a job where she sets her own hours -- days, nights or weekends -- and can apply the theories she learns in class.
"I've been learning a lot more about an industry I really had no interest in initially," Ms. Otuyelu said of her job at Oxford Health in White Plains. "And temping allows you to build skills you wouldn't normally aim to develop, such as learning to be very flexible, time management and how to prioritize." 
 Unlike the older practice of filling in for an ill secretary, temporary workers today range from administrative support personnel to graphic designers, accountants, lawyers, marketing specialists and top executives. The industry has grown from $20.5 billion in annual receipts in 1991 to a record $43.6 billion in 1996, with an average daily employment level of 2.3 million people.
"The industry is continuing to grow because it makes a lot of economic and life-style sense," said Catherine Candland, chief executive officer and founder of Advantage Staffing Services, which has headquarters in Stamford.
"When I first got into the staffing field 13 years ago, we were placing people in positions because someone was out sick or on maternity leave," Ms. Candland said. "The business world was not really as adept at the idea of bringing in talent that was temporary. But the caliber of person doing temporary work is much more diverse now than it was then. Many people who are between 22 and 50 are starting to recognize that your career is something that you manage. And I think businesses certainly see the advantages of bringing talent in for certain projects and having a leaner core staff."
Ms. Candland's understanding of the industry has made her company highly successful and brought her kudos from the group of temporaries, called associates, who work for her as well as the companies that are her clients. Advantage, which provides temporary, interim and alternative staffing for small companies to those on the Fortune 100 list, has offices throughout the state and in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Washington and Texas. The company has experienced 35 percent growth a year since its founding and had close to $100 million in revenues last year, making it the largest company owned by a woman in Connecticut as well as the largest independent staffing concern in Connecticut. Ms. Candland has been named to Fortune's list of "America's 40 Smartest Entrepreneurs," has been called Southern New England Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young and Entrepreneur Magazine, listed in Entrepreneur Magazine's list "40 under 40" and on Mirabella's list of "1,000 Most Influential Women in the United States." She also received an American Express "Vendor of the Year Award" last year.
Advantage was one of the first companies to offer benefits -- health, dental, life insurance, a 401 (k) plan, paid holidays, vacations and free training -- to temporaries as well as its own full-time employees. Ninety-five percent of Advantage temporaries are rated above average to excellent, according to company statistics, and the company has a retention rate for temporaries of 600 percent more than the industry average (nine months compared with two to six weeks).
"Advantage doesn't waste my time with candidates who don't fit the bill," said Len Johnson, human resources manager at Fuji Color Processing in Elmsford. "If they don't have someone that's right for the position, they'll tell me that. So when I use an Advantage temp, it's the right person as opposed to someone who's forced to fit."
Mr. Johnson said Fuji uses temporary workers primarily for clerical and customer service positions, though when he was with a previous employer, Mr. Johnson hired a human resources manager who was an Advantage associate at the time.
"Managers are sometimes skeptical about bringing in a temp when they have a permanent position they need to fill," he said. "But they have in many cases found they like the temp enough to make a hire, and there's far less risk of hiring someone who has already been temping because they've done the job and you know their skills and background."
The National Association of Temporary and Staffing Services reports that more than 6 million former temporary employees moved into permanent jobs in 1996 (5.3 million were full-time positions), with almost 40 percent of the jobs being filled by clients of a temp company.
May Bloomer Bartels falls into that category. She worked as an associate with Advantage during 1996 and 1997 and last summer was hired as art director at Knowledge Industries in White Plains, one of the companies where she had been a temp.
"I was very conscious of the kind of work I wanted," said Ms. Bartels, who operated her own sculpture studio while working as a temporary. "Advantage was very considerate of whether the work was challenging enough for me, and they had a good body of clients. I stayed with clients for several months at a time, which is good because you are given more responsibility on your project. You're not simply a fill-in."
Ms. Bartels said she knew Advantage was right for her from the first meeting. "One of the things that impressed me about Advantage was their careful screening process. I was there for four hours. They tested me on the computer, looked at my portfolio and gave me an extensive interview." Now that Ms. Bartels contracts for temporary workers for her company, she said she knows "the person Advantage is sending is truly capable."
For those who are not quite ready for a job, Advantage offers free computer training. "We are getting very highly qualified professionals who want to work with Advantage; we just need more of them," said Jacqui Gray, director of sales in the Advantage office in White Plains. "And if you can't find them, you have to create them. We'll help train people in computer skills, because you have to keep up with the changes almost every week. You can't beat it, so you've got to join it."
Ms. Gray's job involves meeting with company representatives to discuss their needs. "Companies are turning to staffing firms for more ideas," she said. "We're all going through a problem with recruiting, because the unemployment rate is so low. We've teamed up with our clients to do job fairs together. We screen resumes for our clients and work as a contract recruiter, and we're working closer with schools and colleges, doing more presentations to tell students what the expectations are in the marketplace."
She observed that "10 years ago, companies may have had bigger budgets and would typically staff positions, but now, especially because technology is changing so much, they bring in more specialized people for special projects."
Cheryl Considine, director of art and catalogue production at Amscan Inc. in Elmsford, uses Advantage associates for presentations and art compositions. "We often need temporary help for special projects that we get short notice on. And because I have really good communication with Advantage, 95 percent of the time the caliber of the worker is exactly what we're looking for." The only disadvantage of using temporaries, she said, is that "once in a while you get someone you're happy with and they take a position somewhere else because there's no long-term commitment. But we expect that."
Short-term assignments suit Nicole Powell of White Plains just fine. "If I need time off, it's very easy for me to go ahead and take it," she said. Ms. Gray said that some of the older temporaries take the winter off, while they live in Florida for the season, and others like the opportunity to have more than two weeks' vacation.
Ms. Otuyelu said, "The only thing I really don't like is the uncertainty, but that also happens with a full-time job."
The assignment length is often economical to the companies. "It usually works out well for a temp to be here a certain time, because it avoids a placement fee," Mr. Johnson said, referring to a person hired full time. "When compared to recruiting, it's equivalent to or cheaper to hire someone temp to perm."
While some assignments turn into permanent jobs, the main focus is on short-term positions. "There's a great interest by people who want to be independent contractors and control their own job growth and destiny," Ms. Gray said. "I think part of it is Generation X, where people don't want to get tied down to one company or such a routine. My generation, the Baby Boomers, worked 80 hours a week, and it was ridiculous. We sacrificed our home life. The new group coming up is not going to turn out like that. They've learned from us that you can burn out quickly."

HEADLINE: Going Once, Gone! Action's Fast In Real Estate

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
KEVIN AND LINDA SMITH were looking for a new home with more room for themselves, their two sons and Mr. Smith's dog training business.
A four-bedroom farmhouse built in 1810 with nine acres of land in Canton beckoned. Mr. Smith said he and his wife first saw it at 1 P.M. on March 1, and five hours later they signed a contract with the owner. 
 The dizzying speed of the agreement left them a little queasy because they hadn't even put their own house on the market yet. But their anxiety evaporated when their house also sold quickly.
"We had our house on the market for 20 to 25 days," he said. "We didn't have a lot of showings, but the third or fourth person who came here to look at it was the one who bought it."
The buyers, another young family, also moved quickly. Mr. Smith said they began negotiating over the price less than an hour after walking in the door, and signed a contract the next day. Apparently concerned that the Smiths might be lured away by a better offer, the buyers gave them a significant nonrefundable down payment in return for a contract stipulation taking the house off the market.
Connecticut is enjoying its best residential real estate market in a decade. Houses are selling in days, instead of languishing for months, and it isn't unusual for sellers to receive multiple offers, some of them topping the listing price.
Real estate brokers compare the current market to the heady 80's, but with an important difference: prices so far have remained stable, rather than soaring upward driven by high demand and low supply. And real estate agents can only complain that good properties aren't coming on the market fast enough to keep up with the buying spree.
"It's about time," said John Alubicki, manager of DeWolf New England Real Estate in Avon, which represented the Smiths.
"I can't tell you if it's up 19 percent, 25 percent, or 75 percent, and I don't care," said Barbara Schmerzler, a broker in Westport and president of the Connecticut Association of Realtors. (A spokesperson at the association's office in Hartford said home sales in January and February were 19 percent higher than the same two months in 1997.)
Ms. Schmerzler attributed the rise in market activity to improvement in the economy, the burgeoning stock market and generally high consumer confidence across the nation. People are no longer afraid of losing their jobs, she said.
Further fueling the market are the lowest mortgage interest rates in 20 years, she added. Many renters have found it cheaper to buy a house than continue to rent, especially since a shortage of attractive apartments has driven up rents across the state. And new Federal tax regulations allowing sellers to keep more of their capital gains have also generated a lot of selling and buying.
Ms. Schmerzler also said that different regions of the state have different forces at work in their markets.
Fairfield County has seen New Yorkers, flush with money from bonuses and stock portfolios, competing with corporate executives relocating from other states, and with residents who want to buy a bigger house or move into a better neighborhood.
Litchfield County, especially around Sharon and Kent, is attracting New Yorkers looking for a second home, as well as retirees from around the state. Many of these retirees are in their 50's and 60's, rather than the septuagenarians who characterized this group in the past, Ms. Schmerzler said.
Throughout the center of the state, the improving economic climate for small businesses has generated a lot of buying and selling among young families and first-time buyers, as well as early retirees who often use their nest eggs to open small businesses. Along the shoreline, retirees and prosperous families are competing for views of Long Island Sound.
Prices in the suburbs, Ms. Schmerzler said, range from around $90,000 for small Cape Cods and condominiums in communities like East Hartford and Manchester to $300,000 to $500,000 for an average house in Westport, to estates priced in millions of dollars in New Canaan and Darien. In every region, it has become very difficult to find an attractive, well-kept house with a good location at the lower end of the price range.
The large cities -- Bridgeport, New Haven and Hartford -- haven't seen their real estate markets improve as much as in the rest of the state, but Ms. Schmerzler said single-family homes and condominiums in those communities have just begun selling faster.
Brokers first noticed the improving home market last summer, and it has accelerated steadily since then. The spring season used to be the busiest, but that tradition ended about 10 years ago, said Marilyn Maurer, a broker in Madison. Usually, the market slows down around Christmas and New Year's, but not this time, which gave it a lot of momentum with which to start 1998, she said. The snowless, mild winter kept builders at work and buyers on the hunt.
Harry and Lois Fischer, of Avon, wanted to buy a condominium for their daughter, Sharon, who was renting. They found a unit they liked, also in Avon, last September, and found themselves in a bidding battle.
"There were three other people who wanted that condo all on the same night," Mrs. Fischer said. The asking price for the unit was $132,000, and their bid of $130,000 prevailed.
Similarly, Thomas and Charlene Bayley bought a condominium in Avon. Mr. Bayley, who is employed in Buenos Aires, said they wanted a home base in Connecticut and that they had had a difficult time finding a suitable house to rent last April, finally convincing a home seller to take his property off the market and lease it to them for a year.
In December, the Bayleys went into the market as buyers, looking for a condominium in a gated and guarded complex. They found it in a little over two hours on New Year's Eve, quickly agreed with the owner on a price, signed a contract on Jan. 2 and closed on Jan. 30.
The house they had rented, which the owner was unable to sell a year ago, was recently sold without even being listed, Mr. Bayley said.
That the ease and speed with which houses sell, and the bidding battles that sometimes occur, haven't driven up prices is a curious phenomenon. Ms. Schmerzler said that "buyers are picky," and don't want to get into the situation that some people who bought in the late 80's found themselves. Many bought houses at prices that by the 90's exceeded the value of their properties.
Some brokers are concerned, nonetheless. "I get a little worried about it, because if a nice house comes on the market at a reasonable price, there are two or three offers on it at the asking price," said Anne M. Smith, a broker in Fairfield. "That's what happened in the 80's."
For the moment the housing market demands buyers with steady nerves and a checkbook at hand. "The number of situations in which there are multiple offers is something we're seeing quite frequently," said Mr. Alubicki. "It's a daily occurrence."
One of the real estate agents in his office recently had a buyer who was interested enough in a property to make an offer that was higher than the listing price, but lost it to a still higher bidder.
"If people don't move quickly, step up to the plate and make an offer, they can lose it," he said.

HEADLINE: What's Ahead for Ocean Beach?

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
OCEAN BEACH PARK in New London was glamorous in the 1940's. Vacationers from Hartford and from Springfield, Mass., rented cottages and rooms near the beach, known for its fine-grained sand and spectacular views of Long Island Sound. Visitors strolled on the boardwalk and in the evening danced to the music of the big bands in the recreation hall.
On a hot summer night, Letitia Smith could hear the music of Tommy Dorsey's orchestra and the laughter of the dancers from her home across the street. "I was a young teen-ager. My mother let me go over and stand in the ballroom at the foot of the stage. I got autographs from all the big bands," said Ms. Smith, who lived in New London for 55 years and is now a resident of Uncasville. 
 Ronnie Hodge, who lives a block and a half from the beach, recalled that the boardwalk was lined with food stands. Boys, perched on the railing, eyed the cliques of girls walking by. The miniature golf course was in its prime, and traveling carnivals set up rides and other attractions in the parking lot.
Over the past 20 years, however, the beach has fallen victim to the same forces that have drained New London -- hard times and the flight of businesses and residents from the city. The small amusement park, which attracted busloads of schoolchildren on day trips, is gone. The picnic pavilion and some of the food stands need repair. The terrace of the main building, which overlooks the Sound, is crumbling. Sections of the building are boarded up. Places where flowers once flourished are empty patches of soil. Attendance during the summer has fallen from more than a million to fewer than 300,000.
Ms. Smith and Ms. Hodge are members of Save Ocean Beach, a group formed a year and a half ago to stop the deterioration of the beach, owned by the city, and restore it as a public recreation park. Members of the group are particularly upset with the condition of the buildings. And they are dissatisfied with the way the city has managed the beach. They urged the City Council last December not to let another summer season begin without renovating the buildings. But the council decided to delay major changes until completion of a study of the beach by Wallace Roberts & Todd, an urban planning firm.
Save Ocean Beach members welcomed the news that the beach was included in the properties to be analyzed by the Wallace firm, which was hired by the New London Development Corporation, a group focused on economic development in the city. The firm will consider how to increase the economic potential of Ocean Beach as a public park. The firm is expected to make its recommendations by summer.
A heartening sign, like the Wallace firm's study, is something New Londoners haven't seen in a long time. "Everybody has been so down on New London," said Ms. Hodge. "It was as though somebody gave the city a vote of confidence."
The firm has also been assigned to design a plan for the peninsula area made up of the former New London Mills property, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, the city wastewater treatment plant and other privately held land. The sites are a five-minute drive from Ocean Beach. The New London Development Corporation hopes to attract biotechnology research operations and other commercial and recreational projects to the peninsula. Pfizer Inc. is to be the anchor company of the development with a $150 million building at the New London Mills site on Pequot Avenue.
Members of Save Ocean Beach offered their ideas for improving the beach at a meeting with Richard Collier, a senior associate with the Wallace firm. They said they envisioned the beach as a family recreation area and discussed turning the bathhouse, which is seldom used, into a community center. They also suggested rebuilding the picnic area and adding a pier for fishing, a nature trail, a seafood restaurant and activities for teen-agers.
Members of the group said they want the beach to remain city-owned and compatible with the surrounding residential neighborhood. "We've been paying taxes for this beach," one member added. "It belongs to the people of New London."
A hotel and conference center is another of the many ideas mentioned for Ocean Beach. Stephen Percy, a real estate agent and board member of the New London Development Corporation, said such a center would help the park become self-supporting. But Claire Gaudiani, who is president of Connecticut College and of the New London Development Corporation, said she didn't think the corporation had any definite interests yet, since plans for the beach are in the early stages.
New London's City Manager, Richard Brown, asked that Ocean Beach be added to the list of properties to be studied by the Wallace firm. "There are a number of ideas that would be attractive, but they have to be supported by market studies," he said. "I certainly applaud what Save Ocean Beach has done. But they're not the only consumers who use the beach. I want the beach to be what the City Council determines it should be. And we'll look at how that is to be funded. We'll determine whether or not the project can be done by New London Development Corporation, the city or outside investment."
Mr. Collier said people must remember that the future of the beach must be grounded in reality, not based on what it was 20 years ago. "Hopefully, we can come up with a plan most people can support. We'll try to build consensus," he said.
The 80 members of Save Ocean Beach organized out of fear the city would place the beach under control of a private operator without hearing residents' opinions first. The group was also concerned that use of the beach would be restricted.
Since then, Save Ocean Beach has kept pressure on the city, and there are some indications the city is responding. The main building at the beach, which is now condemned, will be partially renovated by July. Several fees for the season, which begins on Memorial Day, were reduced to draw more visitors. And the city put a marketing plan into effect. Save Ocean Beach is an example of the surge of citizen activism New London is experiencing, said another member, Eleanor Butler. "It's turning us around. People are tired of waiting for the city to do things. They're looking for ways to make things better."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/North Bergen, N.J.;
Work Begins on a 350,000-Sq.-Ft. Retail Center

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THE site should have been a retailer's dream: Seventeen acres atop a rocky slope in the Hudson County community of North Bergen, N.J., visible to drivers along the Route 3-Route 495 corridor on the way to or from the Lincoln Tunnel, just over a mile away.
Because of a 1980's developer's financial problems, however, the property at Kennedy Boulevard has long been anything but dreamlike. But things are beginning to change. In the next month, demolition will begin at the billiards parlor and Shop Rite supermarket that had occupied the site for decades, and workers began removing the remnants of a failed housing development destroyed by fire four years ago. 
 The structures will be replaced by a retail center comprising 350,000 square feet of stores -- 80 percent of which have been leased, most to national retailers -- a 20-screen Regal movie theater, a new and bigger Shop Rite and parking for 1,300 cars.
Construction is to start this month on the project, called Columbia Park, with completion expected in 16 months. It is being developed by The Real Estate Equity Company, or TREECO, a concern based in Englewood, N.J., and by Forest City Ratner Companies, a prominent developer in New York City. The Ives Group of Fair Lawn, N.J., is the project architect.
Financing for the $100 million development, which includes the cost of the land, is coming from the partners' own equity and bank loans. The partners are to close the deal on the site next month.
For the developers the project represents an opportunity to capitalize on what they say is the site's locational advantages and the area's density. Some 472,000 people with an average household income of $64,900 a year live within a three-mile radius of the site, according to a market study done for the partners.
"Demographically the site is perfect," said Sandeep Mathrani, senior vice president and director for retail development at Forest City. He said his company, which is making its first foray into New Jersey, viewed the area "as the sixth borough" of New York City.
Frederick S. Fish, a principal with Nathan J. Shamlo at TREECO, added, "It is one of the few places in the New York metropolitan region that is under-retailed with national-brand merchants."
The project is good news for North Bergen, which because of an inadequate infrastructure watched from the sidelines during much of the mid-80's construction boom as developers bypassed it for other Hudson County communities, such as Jersey City. "Columbia Park is the beginning of a new chapter of growth for North Bergen," said Joseph R. Auriemma, the township's administrator.
THE project, he said, is part of a broader plan in the works for several years to improve the township's image as a place to do business and to upgrade its road and transportation systems, which have been hindrances to growth.
Those efforts are now bearing fruit, he said, adding that some $100 million in public funds have been secured for road improvements, primarily for three overpasses. Several other projects are also being advanced, including a 500-unit residential complex on the township's quarter-mile stretch of the Hudson River waterfront.
"North Bergen is pro-business and will support projects that will increase its tax base and benefit its residents," said Mayor Nicholas J. Sacco, who is also a State Senator.
Once complete, Columbia Park will produce $50 million to $60 million in new tax revenue to the township and generate up to 800 full- and part-time jobs, the developers and township officials said.
The project reflects the trend in New Jersey and the region toward what are called "power centers." Columbia Park meets the definition of such centers used by the International Shopping Center Council of Manhattan: open-air retail strips with 250,000 to 750,000 square feet of space and three or more large "big-box users" or speciality stores.
"The major growth is of big-box users, and it shows no signs of abating," said Ted Kraus, who heads a retail consulting firm in Mercerville, N.J.
Columbia Park is proceeding at a time when the economy is strong, national retailers continue to return to urban locations and the amount of available retail space is tightening. New Jersey's retail vacancy rate is 3.5 percent, down from 5 percent the same time last year, Mr. Kraus said.
"This is as good as I've seen it in the 26 years I've been in the business," he said, noting that "under today's conditions the North Bergen project should be a home run."
It took more than timing, however, to get everything in alignment at the Columbia Park site, where redevelopment efforts have languished for more than a decade. In the mid-80's an earlier developer -- Peter Mocco, a former Mayor of North Bergen -- began building condominiums on part of the site.
But after the exterior shells of the buildings were completed Mr. Mocco ran into financial problems and the dormant project became a magnet for the homeless until the buildings were swallowed by fire in 1994, Mr. Auriemma said, adding that the site itself became "a black hole."
Ultimately, Mr. Mocco lost the property to his lender, and when that bank failed the property wound up in the hands of the Federal Deposit Insurance Company. Early last year the F.D.I.C. sold it at auction to TREECO, which was later joined by Forest City.
"We knew the site's potential," Mr. Fish said. In 1987, his company redeveloped a 100,000-square-foot former Sears department store across Kennedy Boulevard in Union City into multiple uses.
The company also knew that the site is part of an urban enterprise zone, designated by the state 18 months ago. Such zones provide tax incentives to businesses and lower sales taxes -- 3 percent instead of 6 -- to retail customers. Much of the tax revenue generated by the zones can be reinvested back into communities for approved projects, making North Bergen's strong desire to redevelop the site even stronger.
After 15 months of negotiations and the resolution of two lawsuits involving the owner of the supermarket -- who wanted to develop the site himself -- the partners, in cooperation with township officials, put together the current plan, which includes the larger supermarket.
Along with granting the project a five-year tax abatement, the township is using $1 million raised from the urban enterprise zone to prepare the site for development, including razing the existing buildings and making improvements such as adding a turning lane for cars to enter the site.
The idea behind the plan is to maximize the site, generate tax revenue and attract more businesses, said Herb Klitzner, the township's lawyer. He said the township rejected proposals by other developers who wanted to build housing there.
TREECO's initial proposal for a 150,000-square-foot center was expanded when Forest City, which has developed the Metrotech Center in downtown Brooklyn and other urban sites, entered the scene. The property is unusual because its rear portion drops 30 feet down the side of the cliff, essentially putting the site at two different levels, said Mr. Mathrani of Forest City.
As now envisioned, the upper level, facing Kennedy Boulevard, will house the shopping center, with its back section extending onto a concrete platform built into the side of the cliff. The movie theater will occupy the lower level, which faces Route 495, an access road to Route 3, Mr. Mathrani said. He added that a ramp would connect the two levels.
In all, the center will house 12 tenants. The larger retailers will include, in addition to the 70,000-square-foot movie complex, a 33,000-square-foot Circuit City electronics store and a 25,000-square-foot Staples office supply store.
The supermarket will expand to 65,000 square feet from 40,000, Mr. Fish said, and there will also be seven smaller tenants; rents will range from $25 to $30 a square foot.
One side of the building will contain a sign with the names of the tenants, giving them and the project "a billboard along Route 3," Mr. Fish said.

HEADLINE: OFF THE RACK;
The Richer Rich, and Where They Live

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK 

 BODY:
CONSIDER: The income of the top 1 percent of Americans, or about 2.6 million people, now equals that of the bottom one-third of the population -- or 88 million people.
That is just one of the disquieting statistics in a column in the May issue of Smart Money that takes a sobering look at the income gap between rich and poor. The column, "Rich Man, Poor Man," by Albert R. Hunt and Alan Murray, describes inequities in income distribution that many people believe are tearing at the very fabric of American life. Moreover, the authors say that the gap is growing and that the figures used to describe it -- from the Census Bureau, Congressional Budget Office and Federal Reserve Board -- probably understate the situation. 
 The gap wasn't always growing, Mr. Hunt and Mr. Murray note. From the end of World War II until the late 1960's, it actually narrowed a bit. But then it stabilized. By the early 1980's, when the gap started to widen, the poorest 20 percent of Americans had 4.3 percent of all income; by 1996, that share dropped to 3.7 percent. During the same period, the income share of the richest 5 percent of Americans grew to 21.4 percent, from a little less than 16 percent.
There is also a gap -- a canyon, actually -- between liberal and conservative perceptions of the situation and what to do about it.
Liberals, the authors write, see the growing economic pie as failing to feed the neediest and contend that some of the biggest winners are not all that deserving. They argue for Government investments to help the poor and a $1-an-hour increase in the minimum wage, to $6.15. They also believe that moving to a flat tax or national sales tax would make the situation worse by raising taxes on the middle class to generate the same revenue or by forcing cuts in programs for the poor.
Many ardent conservatives, Mr. Hunt and Mr. Murray say, dismiss the income gap as irrelevant, arguing that the only real issue is increasing wealth. In a classic defense of "trickle-down economics," this viewpoint holds that as the income gap widens, the poor eventually benefit. Lower income taxes and lower capital-gains taxes, its advocates say, not Government programs or regulations, will spur investment and raise wages.
Nowhere is this income gap more obvious than in the May issue of Worth magazine, which contains its annual listing of the richest towns in America, based solely on median home prices. This year's list contains 250 towns with median values of at least $315,000; the 1997 list included 238 towns with median values of at least $300,000. To make the list, a town also has to have a population of at least 600.
The 10 richest towns include 8 from last year's list, though the order has changed. The two new additions to the top 10 are Belvedere and Los Altos Hills, both in California. Falling off the list this year were Centre Island, N.Y., on Long Island, and Kapalua, on Maui in Hawaii, because their populations slipped to less than 600.
This year's richest town is Aspen, Colo., population 5,049, with a median home price of $1.51 million. The others are Jupiter Island, Fla., 601, $1.22 million; Rolling Hills, Calif., 1,748, $1.17 million; Atherton, Calif., 7,500, $1.15 million; Matinecock, N.Y., on Long Island, 880, $1.07 million; Hillsborough, Calif., 10,589, $1.02 million; Belvedere, 2,071, $986,000; Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., 12,300, $963,000; Los Altos Hills, 7,900, $960,000, and Snowmass Village, Colo., 1,449, $960,000.
Seven states account for more than 85 percent of the list: 78 of the towns are in California, 54 in New York, 24 in New Jersey, 20 in Illinois, 15 in Massachusetts, 12 in Connecticut and 11 in Florida. The New York-New Jersey-Connecticut region accounts for 90, or more than a third.
The article, by Jane Berentson and Loch Adamson, also contains profiles of residents of these enclaves. For the photographs, the magazine posed many of these people happily surrounded by trappings of their wealth.
 
MOVING ALONG The May issue of Money reflects more changes under its new managing editor, Robert Safian. The magazine continues to have a more modular and cleaner look and features two new columns: Virtual Consumer, about on-line shopping, and Object Lesson, a buying guide.
Money's annual feature on the best places to live in America, usually published in the July issue, will appear in a condensed form this year, in conjunction with the magazine's site on the World Wide Web (www.money.com/bestplaces). And its annual college survey, scheduled for September, may be scrapped; a spokeswoman said no final decision had been made.
 
CREDIT WHERE DUE Worth and Money examine premium credit cards for big spenders. Both like the American Express Platinum card, despite its $300 yearly fee, because it offers many travel perks, including a free companion ticket if the card holder buys a first-class or business-class ticket.
And, Worth sniffs, "it's the only card left with a modicum of snob appeal."
 
A DRIVING ISSUE The May issue of Individual Investor likes auto stocks, especially shares of Ford and Chrysler and the American depository receipts of Honda. But the magazine thinks the A.D.R.'s of Volkswagen are overpriced, despite what is expected to be huge success for its new Beetle.

HEADLINE: Buyers Finding Smaller Inventory of Homes for Sale

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST 

 BODY:
TWO years of unrelenting buyer demand has reduced the inventory of homes for sale throughout the New York metropolitan area.
Residential listings in many suburban communities are significantly below those of the last year or two. And in New York City, the ongoing demand for housing has so depleted the listings that multiple-bidding wars for newly available properties break out frequently, brokers and real-estate executives say. 
"The biggest factor is, this city is booming, in some sense, psychologically," said Steven James, director of sales for Douglas Elliman's East Side office. "It looks good, it feels good. It's an exciting time in this city, and that translates into sales. People are thronging to live here."
But while New York's appeal is driving up prices in Manhattan and Brooklyn, brokers say buyers in the suburbs are still resistant to overpaying, thereby discouraging rapid appreciation.
"I would not be putting adjectives on this market as a buyer's market or a seller's market," said Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. "It's somewhere in the middle."
Spring generally brings an increase in residential listings. But because of the real-estate market's unbroken pace over the winter months, brokers don't expect to see much of an upward blip this year. Along with the robust economy and low interest rates, mild weather conditions enabled buyers to keep looking throughout the winter months, traditionally a time when demand lags.
With a backlog of buyers waiting for new properties to come on the market, brokers say, new listings aren't languishing long enough to rebuild an inventory.
The smaller inventory in the suburbs has meant that buyers generally have to look longer before they find a suitable property. And brokers say they don't have enough houses to meet the demand.
"Everyone is saying the same thing, office to office: 'We wish we had more inventory,' " said Mary Ann Evick, executive vice president of William Raveis Real Estate in Connecticut.
When a house comes on the market in the suburbs, brokers say, buyers must be prepared to act quickly, with multiple offers common now for desirable properties.
 Brokers in New York City report similar patterns. According to the Corcoran Group, its listings showed 16 percent fewer apartments for sale in Manhattan at the close of 1997 than at the end of 1996. Listings for apartments priced below $500,000 were down 24 percent, the agency said.
The Halstead Property Company reported a drop of 27 percent in apartment listings below 96th Street in Manhattan for the first quarter of the year, compared with the first quarter of 1997.
New listings continue to come in, said Tresa Hall, sales director of the Corcoran Group's East Side office, but they are slowing. "There was a time about a year, year-and-a-half ago when we would have 15 or 20 new exclusives to talk about at the beginning of our meetings," she said. "Now, we have three."
Particularly acute is the shortage of large family apartments, and buyers must pay dearly for a classic six-room on the West Side, or eight rooms on the East Side. According to Kay Brover, an executive vice president with Douglas Elliman in their West Side office, as of last week her agency listed only 34 six-room co-ops on the West Side. And most of those are priced between $425,000 and $1 million.
While smaller apartments for growing families tend to be more available, Ms. Brover said, "they're getting outpriced -- you can't find a decent two-bedroom for under $300,000."
CHANGES in the Federal tax law that exempt a couple's first $500,000 of gain on a real estate sale from capital gains tax has not helped replenish listings the way many brokers expected. "We thought we'd see some of your middle to larger apartments coming on the market, but we're just not seeing a lot of that happening," said Diane Ramirez, executive director of sales for the Halstead Property Company.
Because listings are so limited in every size and price range, Ms. Ramirez said, customers are settling for less-than-prime street and building locations "just to get a good apartment." The most desirable listings, of course, bring buyers out in droves.
"We recently had, in one case, 14 people with written bids above asking price wanting the same million-dollar property," Ms. Ramirez said.
Ms. Hall of the Corcoran Group said she had seen high-end properties overbid by as much as $300,000. "If a buyer really wants to get an apartment, we tell them they must come in at asking price and even go a little higher," she said.
There are more available apartments for rent now than in the past two years, according to Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a Manhattan real-estate brokerage. But given that her figures show that average rental prices for apartments on the Upper East and West Sides rose 6.05 percent in 1997 and are continuing to rise, she noted, buyer demand is obviously exceeding supply.
In Brooklyn, the growing cachet of neighborhoods such as Park Slope and Prospect Heights has depleted inventory and driven up prices there to the point where very little is currently available for sale below $500,000, according to Mary Ann Albano, vice president and sales manager at the Park Slope office of William B. May.
"Two years ago I could show somebody 10 houses in each price range, and now today, I can't even show them five," Ms. Albano said. "People who were once moving out to the suburbs are no longer doing so. When they sell their co-op, they want to buy a house here. Since they can't do that because there's nothing on the market, co-ops are getting tight."
Listings are also down sharply on Long Island. As of the end of February, total inventory in Nassau, Suffolk and Queens was down 12 percent from the same time last year, and 16 percent compared with February 1996, according to the Long Island Board of Realtors. The average sale price has risen 11 percent in the last two years. While the dearth of inventory can be tough on buyers, said the board's chief executive, Joseph Mottola, "it behooves the seller to be cautious about committing, leaving the way open for the highest offer."
AS for Northern New Jersey, Denise Smith, spokeswoman for Weichert Realtors, reported the following figures for first quarter 1998 listings, compared with last year's first quarter for Essex, Morris, Somerset, Union and Sussex Counties:
In Essex, there were 2,080 listings, compared with 2,364 in 1997; in Morris, 2,402 against 3,012; in Somerset, 1,960 against 2,206; in Union, 2,365 against 2,894, and in Sussex, 2,159 against 2,264.
In Westchester County, residential listings numbered about 6,600 at the close of the first quarter, about 2,000 fewer than a year earlier, according to Mr. Mercurio, of the Westchester Board of Realtors. The reason, he said, is two years of record-high sales. "This sharply accelerating sales volume in our residential categories has simply outpaced the normal build-up of inventory that occurs," Mr. Mercurio explained.
In Fairfield County, Conn., data compiled by William Pitt Real Estate showed 887 listings in Greenwich at the end of the first quarter this year, compared with 949 for the same period a year earlier; in New Canaan, there were 246 listings for detached homes this year, against 294 in 1997, and in Westport, 261 detached-home listings, against 273 in 1997. Half of the listings in Greenwich were for $1 million or more.
The average price of homes sold as of April 13 in Fairfield County was up only about 8.6 percent over last year. Buyers are checking the sale prices of other homes on the street they are interested in and refusing to pay too much, said Jerry Whitson, a broker with William Raveis. At the same time, however, Mr. Whitson said he had to convince buyers that if they did not act quickly when they find a house they like, they would likely lose it to someone else.
"I have three people waiting for houses now -- if something new comes on, they must come out and see it that day," he said. "We're seeing an old phenomenon that happened in 1986 -- multiple offers."

HEADLINE: If I Had a Hammer

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
EDWARD A. SMITH, a commercial contractor, was there in 1984 when Paterson Habitat for Humanity undertook its first affordable-housing project in the old industrial city.
"I framed the first house," he said. 
 And last Saturday -- 70 houses later -- he was there again. Only this time he was the group's project director, overseeing about 50 volunteers, as diverse as a roofer and an orthodontist, as they banged away with hammers during the rough framing of a duplex on East Third Street that would become the first homes to be owned by another two poor families.
"I'm strictly a volunteer," Mr. Smith said. Then he laughed and said, with some pride: "A full-time volunteer. Fourteen years. Right from the beginning."
The house going up in Paterson is one of thousands built throughout New Jersey over the last decade by non-profit organizations. Whether as volunteers or modestly paid employees, dedicated people like Ed Smith are essential to the efforts of the community development groups that are trying to fill housing gaps in economically depressed areas as Federal government programs have dwindled.
New Jersey is among the top 10 states in the number of non-profit community development groups, housing experts say. In a little more than 10 years, some 170 non-profit community-based development corporations have built about 12,000 units of low- and moderate-income housing in New Jersey, said Diane Sterner, executive director of the Affordable Housing Network of New Jersey, a statewide association of about 120 such groups. In many cases, their efforts have provided job training and spurred economic development in the neighborhoods as well.
"This is a success story," said David Schwartz, director of the American Affordable Housing Institute at Rutgers University, which does research on local and national housing issues. "But it's not a story that suggests the non-profits have been able to meet the need."
Even though the groups cannot do it all, Professor Schwartz said: "They've done some very good work, some outstanding work. They're mostly dedicated people, people working very hard."
Here is a glimpse of some of those people in three such groups: Friends of the Carpenter in North Plainfield, Isles in Trenton, and Paterson Habitat for Humanity, as well the Affordable Housing Network itself.
 
From Theory to Practice On Urban Development
Martin Johnson still has the build of the running back that he was at Princeton University, but it is his scholarly side that helped to create Isles 17 years ago and still guides the nonprofit agency that designs and implements community development programs in Trenton.
His commitment is sustained by a visceral understanding of the bleak daily existence of the people that Isles serves, knowledge that is rooted in memories of his childhood in Akron, Ohio, growing up in a working poor family with a father who disappeared and a mother who took ill.
A football scholarship to Princeton saved him. And his studies there in cultural anthropology led to the creation, with several Princeton professors and students, of Isles as a means of building leadership and a strong economy in Trenton's poor neighborhoods.
Since 1990, Isles -- short for islands of redevelopment -- has completed construction or rehabilitation of 85 units of affordable housing using minority contractors or its own construction crew. It has another 90 under construction and another 109 on the drawing boards.
The staff has grown over the years to 30 people with an annual operating budget of $1.4 million from government grants and private donations. Mr. Johnson, the group's 39-year-old president, said that one of the agency's first major projects was to help to develop a community garden in a rubble-strewn lot. There are now gardens at 65 sites, providing 150,000 pounds of produce to neighborhoods where supermarkets are scarce.
Isles also has provided training in the construction trades to some 50 high-school dropouts, an environmental education program and a community-based effort to clean up contaminated industrial sites.
"Oh, I love this," said Takisha Griffin, a 20-year-old construction trainee, after she lugged sheets of plasterboard into a house under rehabilitation. A single mother, she dropped out of high school to care for her child but will soon have a job with Isles.
"I'm proud to say I'm no longer on welfare and I'm also proud to say I passed my G.E.D.," she said. "The training program helps so much. People you normally see on the street, possibly doing, if not selling, drugs or causing some type of mischief -- now they have jobs. They're going to school. They're getting an education. People are getting their G.E.D. They're moving up in life."
Mr. Johnson, who recently spent a year at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School teaching courses in urban economic development and poverty and policy, says of Isles, "It's important for me, obviously, to know that we're doing good work here in the city and that there are thousands of people that are benefiting from this work."
"However, that's not what keeps me here," he adds. "What keeps me here after all these years is a really deep conviction that what we're doing is in effect a laboratory that's looking at ways you can engage people in a a much more systematic way and a much more cost-effective way in building local economies that then can be replicated in other places around the country."
 
From Porch Repair To Whole Houses
The Rev. John Giordano, pastor of St. Luke's Roman Catholic Church, and the Rev. Brooks Smith, pastor of the Watchung Avenue Presbyterian Church, became friends about 20 years ago when they first arrived to work in Plainfield.
One day Mr. Smith told Father Giordano of a young hard-working couple who had grown up in North Plainfield who could no longer afford to live in town.
In 1980 they talked of forming a group to help such families and about 10 people from their churches and town responded to create a volunteer board.
"We thought 'Friends of the Carpenter' was sort of a cool name," said Mr. Smith.
"The connotation with Jesus being a carpenter," interjected Father Giordano. "It had a religious connotation."
"Without," added Mr. Smith, "being too religious."
Since then, the group has arranged to build 13 townhouse units and has rehabilitated 65 houses, using federal money and donations.
Leonard Lang, one of the longest-serving volunteers and the board's vice president, recalls that when he joined the group in 1983 it was mostly involved in touch-up work, like repairing porches.
"I suggested we get more ambitious and build new houses," said Mr. Lang, a lighting consultant who owns a number of rental properties in town.
The group bought a piece of property and built eight townhouse units called Chatham Rowe I in 1984; a year later it purchased land across the street for an additional five units called Chatham Rowe II.
As the group's activities increased, the board members who used to divide the tasks decided to hire a part-time executive director, Paul Babik, two years ago. He spends 15 hours a week processing the complicated paperwork involved with getting funding and approvals. (Mr. Babik can be reached at (908) 317-6884. Inquiries about the group can also be made at the Watchung Presbyterian Church, (908) 755-2781.)
Friends has also organized an annual spin-off called Paint the Town; last year 150 volunteers from five churches and a synagogue painted houses for people who are unable to upgrade their properties themselves, such as the ill and the elderly.
Friends of the Carpenter does more than put roofs over people's heads, Father Giordano said.
"If we can take houses that are decrepit and knock them down for new townhouses and rehabilitate houses in bad shape," he said "it also improves the look of the town as well."
 
A Variety of Volunteers, A Variety of Motivations
He was banging nails into the frame of a house under construction on North Third Street in Paterson. His name is Rick Cooper but the other volunteers working for Habitat for Humanity called him Doc because he is an orthodontist.
"It's a break from tightening braces every day," said Dr. Cooper, who has an office in Caldwell. Pressed further about his motives, he added: "You're doing some good, volunteering, helping other people. Teaching other people how to do it."
The volunteers come from every walk of life and range in age from 14 to 80. Many are members of church groups or corporations. Some are proficient; many have to be taught the basics. Many on this day were women who are part of a group called Women Raise The Roof that is trying to raise $120,000 and build a house themselves.
One of them was Marcia Stribling, executive director of the Girl Scout Council of Bergen County.
"As a girl I always wanted to do this kind of stuff," Ms. Stribling said. "But when I was in high school, girls took home ec and boys took shop and that was it."
Learning such skills is practical for anyone, she said, and added: " And I know I'm doing something for somebody. That's what's really wonderful about it."
Habitat, a nonprofit ecumenical organization whose best-known volunteer is former President Jimmy Carter, has 1,426 affiliates in the United States, 22 of them in New Jersey. The group, based in Americus, Ga., has built nearly 60,000 houses around the world.
Pete Brovarone, a roofer from Dumont, was the Paterson Habitat affiliate's volunteer of the year for putting in 720 hours. Like many volunteers, he really doesn't care to discuss his motives.
"They don't have to say anything," said Lou Quiroz, the salaried, part-time site coordinator. "It's enough said they just keep coming back."
Barbara Dunn, the executive director of Paterson Habitat, said there are many who volunteer their efforts for religious reasons. Ed Smith, 58, a commercial contractor who volunteers as project director, is one.
"I have been extremely blessed by God in my lifetime and I think that one of the things as Christians we're called to do is to give back, to help the poor and help those who are needy and less fortunate," he said.
It hasn't always been easy, he admitted.
"I have to be perfectly honest with you, sometimes you wonder why you do it," he said. "Because in the course of 10 years, I've had my vehicles broken into and my tools stolen at least 10 or 12 times. But you just have to say that's experience and that's part of it."
These are some of the people who built 11 houses in 1997, making the Paterson group the No. 1 affiliate of Habitat for Humanity in the 10-state Northeast region.
A few blocks away on Arch Street, Jeffrey Ellerbee was trying to fulfill the requirement that prospective homeowners give at least 500 hours of "sweat equity" helping build houses before they take over their own, which they buy for below cost. He was rehabilitating the house he and his wife and five children hope to move into next month.
"When she found out that we got approved, it was like the Fourth of July to my wife," said Mr. Ellerbee, a 42-year-old repairman for the Paterson Housing Authority. "Every day we ride through here she can almost assume herself sitting on the porch."
 
Finding Strength In Numbers
In 1987 the National Housing Institute and a now-defunct Jersey City neighborhood group suggested an inventory of what nonprofit community development groups were doing. Diane Sterner, who was working for a Newark community group called La Casa de Don Pedro, was hired as a consultant.
At the time she found about 60 groups throughout the state who were doing some sort of community development and met with them to determine what kind of services would help them do their jobs better.
In 1989, a dozen representatives of the groups, including Martin Johnson of Isles, formed a steering committee to create the Affordable Housing Network of New Jersey. Today it has 120 member organizations out of a total of 170 statewide.
Diane Sterner, who became the network's executive director, said its mission was to promote the work of community-based development organizations and create and preserve affordable housing and rebuild lower income communities in New Jersey.
Besides providing a forum for exchange of information, the network, with a staff of 10, also provides training and technical assistance to members on the specifics of such things as applying for funding and hiring an architect and contractor.
It also lobbies for affordable housing and is pressing for a $290 million State Jobs From Housing and Economic Development Bond Act.
Carol Wayman, director of policy for the National Congress for Community Economic Development, a trade association for community nonprofit development corporations, praised the New Jersey Affordable Housing Network as a model for similar organizations in the country.
"They were one of the first to come up with a community economic development public policy agenda," she said, referring in part to their efforts for the housing and jobs bond issue. "They really looked at the landscape of state government programs and how the state could structure itself to support low-income communities."
Ms. Wayman said that 2,200 community-based nonprofit redevelopment groups across the country have created 400,000 units of affordable housing and that New Jersey is among the leaders, both in number of groups and in houses built.
Jane M. Kenny, commissioner of the state Department of Community Affairs, says such groups in New Jersey have been instrumental in strengthening neighborhoods.
"They're serving a very important need because they are getting into areas of communities where we might not have seen construction occur for 25 years and they're anchoring the neighborhoods with affordable housing," Commissioner Kenny said.
From her vantage point, Ms. Sterner says she sometimes feels remote from the work in the field. But then she is buoyed when she sees what the nonprofits have accomplished.
"To see the excitement of the kids when they're living in places, when they have have their own bedroom and a yard to play in and all those things they never had in their lives before," Ms. Sterner said. "That's the kind of thing that keeps me going."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT: FOCUS ON PRECIOUS METALS -- COINS;
The Eagle Hasn't Lost Its Wings

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE 

 BODY:
GOLD'S prolonged depression has thrown miners out of work and ravaged the financial health of many precious-metals companies. But it has created a boom in gold coins.
Worried about how much higher the stock market can go, some investors have been moving money into these coins in the last few years, particularly toward the end of 1997. Rather than viewing gold as an anachronistic hedge against uncertainty and inflation, many see it as a bargain staring them in the face. 
 "Stocks have been a much better investment than gold, but every dog has its day," said Christopher Holton, vice president of marketing for Blanchard & Company in New Orleans, the largest retailer of the American Eagle gold coin -- the most popular in the world. "If you want to buy low and sell high, the first thing you have to do is buy low."
Gold dealers are not predicting a return to the $850-an-ounce days of 1980 and are reluctant to even speculate when gold will break out of its current $300-an-ounce trading range. But the metal's 10 percent recovery from 18-year lows of $280 an ounce, reached in January, has offered some optimism that gold is increasingly viewed as an underpriced asset.
Mr. Holton said sales in March were nearly twice the February level. He described Blanchard's average customer as "55 years old, college educated and either a professional, an entrepreneur or someone in management; that individual also has investments in stocks and bonds."
George Milling-Stanley, manager of gold market analysis at the World Gold Council, a trade group based in Geneva, said sales of gold bullion coins in the United States tripled in 1997, partly because of the depressed price and the stock market's protracted rally. "Some people think it would be a good idea to preserve their gains by going into an investment like gold," he said.
Part of the appeal of gold bullion coins is their size and relative affordability. Unlike gold bricks or bars, they are easily stored, can be mailed to one's home and have a commonly recognized value.
"The nice thing about gold coins is they're the same, like a dollar bill; you can exchange one for another," said Jonathan E. Potts, president of Fidelitrade, a commodity brokerage based in Wilmington, Del. "They're portable. You can carry them with you, hand them on to your children."
Brokers generally sell coins at 3.5 percent above the market price of gold and buy them at 3 percent above the market price, pocketing the difference. (The Eagle sold for $327.47 on Thursday.) But some gold investment strategists say coins' advantages compensate for the disadvantage of the markup.
"Coins will give you a direct, close link to the movements in the price of a metal," said Edward Kempf, a senior research analyst at CPM Group, a precious-metals and commodity research firm based in New York. "If you buy shares in a major gold producer, you have to look at management, political risk, their balance sheet," Mr. Kempf said. "You don't have to do that buying the gold itself."

HEADLINE: NOTICED;
Sheets, the New Status Symbol

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI 

 BODY:
DIANA BUCHANAN, who plans to marry in August, spent much of last week in and out of linen shops on the Upper East Side that sell what might be called the Rolls-Royces of sheets.
On Tuesday afternoon, she agonized for 40 minutes over the purchase of a $95 boudoir pillow, an item the size of a baby's-crib pillow, at D. Porthault, where a set of queen-size sheets and two shams starts at $1,000 for solid colors and $1,800 for prints. 
 For help in understanding the protocol of ultra-luxury bedding, Ms. Buchanan had enlisted her mother, who had come in from Connecticut to point out the hearts-on-white at D. Porthault, the signature chain pattern at Pratesi, the monograms at Leron and the white Jacquard at Frette.
Caressing a crisp cotton pillowcase, Ms. Buchanan, 27, said that the tiny pillow was all that she could afford at this point but that someday she hoped to have a whole sheet set. "I understand the importance of having the right sheets," she said. "It's a very subtle way of saying you have excellent taste without, say, driving a Porsche."
The famous linen shops in the area of Madison Avenue and the high 60's, which have supplied generations of town-house and country-home bedding for the old guard, are being discovered by a new set: people in their 20's and early 30's who want the status of high-end sheets even if they don't yet have the life style to match.
Store owners and managers say that an increasing number of their younger customers are dropping $1,000 to $5,000 on linens for starter-type studio or one-bedrooom apartments. In an economy that keeps minting 29-year-old overnight successes -- and has spawned a culture to match that values traditional totems of the luxe life -- 350-thread-count, Egyptian-cotton sheets are now having their day in the sun.
"It's easier to spend money on sheets than on new furniture," said Stephanie Hamada, 35, who is a publicity director for the accessories company Diego Della Valle and who has Frette sheets on the bed in her one-bedroom Upper East Side apartment. "We're all going toward high-end luxury-quality goods. It's like the Hermes of linen. There's this whole thing about linens and candles."
In the back of the Frette store, clerks make up a queen-size bed to show novice buyers what a duvet cover is and how many pillows are needed (don't even mention blanket covers).
But many are still unprepared for the shock of learning, after purchase, that luxury sheets need ironing and a delicate washing, for which the heavy-duty machines in their building basements are unsuited, unless, of course, sheet fanatics whisk their linens from the dryer when they are still damp. For those who don't want to bother, Frette salesclerks hand customers the card of Rosa Duran, who will hand-wash a sheet set for $32. It's a bargain, considering that Jeeves of Belgravia charges $25 a sheet and $10 a sham.
Elycia Rubin, 27, a talent executive at E! Entertainment Television in Los Angeles, says the sheets, which are all made by European companies, are also popular on the West Coast. "All of the Hollywood celebrities and yuppie types are obsessed about making a really classy bed," she said. "It's not about flannel sheets anymore. It's about showing class. God forbid anyone has sheets on their bed that have less than a 200-thread count."
Ms. Rubin, who found her own Frette sheets at an outlet in Milan, Italy, added, "Cars, clothes, jewelry, sheets -- it's all in the same line."
NOR is it only women who have developed an allegiance to old-line European linen houses that, like Frette, have separate divisions devoted to bedding for private planes and yachts.
Store managers said that more and more men, many of them single, are asking for three or four sets of "whatever is classic," in the words of Laura Sullivan, an assistant manager of Frette. "They are the Wall Street and music-industry types," she added.
Scot Lerner, an owner of Halpern Construction, a building company in Manhattan, said, "I train all my girlfriends and my housekeepers how to wash those sheets."
Chatting by cellular phone from his Land Rover, Mr. Lerner, 33, said that in selecting sheets, "you have to look for a high thread count." He continued: "I'm not buying a sheet and leaving the tag out. I do a lot of things in my bed, and if I don't have good sheets, my skin wears out."
He passed the phone to a friend, Randall Kane, 32, another connoisseur of fine bedding, who said: "Well, I like Pratesi, but I have more of Ralph Lauren. You know, the woven ones. They're good, too."
Mr. Lerner disagreed. "Oh, no, they pill," he said. "But I hear Ralph is coming out with a better line."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT: FOCUS ON PRECIOUS METALS;
Gold Industry Tries to Dig Itself Out

BYLINE: By WILLIAM R. LONG 

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
THE gilded dome of the Colorado state capitol makes a fitting crown for this city as the capital of the nation's gold mining industry. But the dome has a lot more luster than the industry these days: Gold prices are bumping along at levels too low for many of Denver's mining and exploration companies to make money, and there is no relief in sight.
Companies are closing mines, putting new projects on hold, laying off employees and cutting costs to try to ride out the hard times. Big losses are eroding cash reserves and share prices are in the doldrums. 
 And Denver's companies are not alone: The industry depression is worldwide, and companies in gold-mining countries like Australia and South Africa are in even worse shape because their costs are higher.
Many in Denver's gold industry were unprepared for a prolonged slump in gold prices. "What I think we all expected is that if gold prices went below $300, it would be for the short term," said Michele Stell, managing director of the Denver Gold Group, a trade association for the 60-odd mining companies that call Denver home.
But the spot price of gold in London, which spent most of the 1990's in the $375-to-$400 range, started declining steadily about two years ago; it has been near or less than $300 an ounce since November, and sank to an 18-year low, less than $280, in January. A modest recent rally left the spot price at $308.50 on Friday, enough for the most efficient companies, like Newmont Gold, to eke out a profit, but still dangerously low for many others.
The troubles of Echo Bay Mines Ltd., one of the largest gold companies based in the Denver area, are typical of the hard times in the United States industry.
So far this year, Echo Bay has suspended operations at one mine and scaled down at another, cut its exploration budget in half and slashed spending on new projects by 85 percent. It has laid off 800 of its 2,100 workers, cut home-office jobs to 35 from 112 and let go three-fourths of its exploration staff. It expects to produce only 500,000 ounces this year, down from 721,000 in 1997.
Those and other cost-cutting measures, combined with the company's policy of hedging gold prices by buying and selling gold futures, "have positioned us to weather a continued period of low gold prices," said Peter Cheesbrough, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Echo Bay. He said the company had already sold its entire 1998 production in the futures market for at least $340 an ounce, considerably more than recent spot prices.
"Right now we're conserving cash," said Robbin Lee, manager of investor relations. Including one-time charges for layoffs and other cost-cutting measures and a $362.7 million write-down of assets, Echo Bay lost $420.7 million in 1997.
Echo Bay's situation is grim, but better than that of some other American producers. Pegasus Gold Inc. of Spokane, Wash., had just expanded its Mount Todd mine in Australia when prices slipped too low for its output to be sold profitably, said John Pearson, vice president for investor relations at Pegasus. The company put the mine in mothballs last September and took a $353 million charge; the closing put Pegasus in default on a line of credit needed to finance a new mill.
Pegasus cut its payroll nearly in half, to 600 from 1,020, sold its jet and otherwise trimmed costs, but its stock sank anyway, from $8.50 in February 1997 to $1.60 at the end of the year. The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in January and the American Stock Exchange delisted Pegasus soon after.
Pegasus was soon joined by more casualties. The Dakota Mining Corporation was delisted from the American Stock Exchange in February, because its earnings sank below the exchange's criteria. Royal Oak Mines Inc. technically defaulted on $44 million in notes on March 17 and said it might have to suspend its nearly completed $470 million Kemess gold and copper project in British Columbia. Royal Oak got a reprieve later in March when it lined up $120 million in new financing.
"The market is in just a very ugly mood," said Dr. John Dobra, an economist and director of the Natural Resource Industry Institute at the University of Nevada in Reno. With prices so low, he said, about 60 percent of the world's production would be occurring at a loss, assuming 1996 production costs.
"The industry is in trouble if the gold price stays at $300, even $325," said Daniel McConvey, a gold-mining analyst at Goldman, Sachs. Mr. McConvey is predicting an average price this year of $310 an ounce; Ronald Londe of A. G. Edwards & Sons is more pessimistic, projecting $275 to $285 an ounce for the next 12 months and perhaps longer.
Gold's heyday seems long past. In December 1980, after years of monetary instability and high inflation, prices rose briefly to $850 an ounce, and gold was seen as a haven.
But today, with inflation fast asleep, major investors and the central banks of many countries no longer want to stockpile gold. In 1997, Australia and Argentina sold most of their gold reserves. Other causes of low prices, analysts say, are depressed demand in East Asian nations and uncertainty over European gold policy."As long as inflation stays under control," Mr. Londe said, "gold really has nowhere to go."
Many producers are responding as Pegasus and Echo Bay did, by cutting production. Mines that would have produced about 150 tons of gold in 1998 have been closed in recent months, according to David Christensen, a gold analyst with Merrill Lynch in San Francisco. "We're going to need about 400 tons of permanent mine closures before the price is stabilized," Mr. Christensen said.
Such contraction would be painful for the shakiest companies but would leave the lowest-cost producers, like Newmont, relatively unscathed. Newmont spent an average of just $250 to extract each ounce last year; nonproduction costs like exploration, interest payments and overhead add $50 or so an ounce, leaving Newmont a slender profit even at today's depressed prices.
Newmont Mining, which owns 94 percent of Newmont Gold, has tightened its belt, too, laying off 500 people.But "we're not in danger of closing any mines," said Doug Hock, a company spokesman.
Companies large and small, said Ms. Stell of the gold trade association, "are in a survival mode."

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
30 Years After Battle, Uneasy Truce on Heights

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
IF Harlem were flat, the yawning distance between Morningside Avenue and Morningside Drive would seem small -- a few dozen yards. But from 116th Street and Morningside Avenue, where West Harlem ends, you ascend 161 steep steps past green gum wrappers, purple Bic lighters and white plastic syringes to Morningside Drive, the beginning of the Columbia University campus, known to local people outside the university as "up the hill," or "the folks with the money," or, simply, "those people."
Thirty years ago this coming Thursday, Columbia exploded in the student demonstrations of 1968. While student anger centered on the Vietnam War and campus-related military research, Columbia's relations with the surrounding, largely black community quickly became part of the maelstrom. And while the rebellion is perhaps best remembered for the occupation of campus buildings, the nightstick-wielding police and the hundreds of students arrested, Harlem remembers something different: Columbia as overbearing landlord. 
 For years before 1968 and years afterward, Columbia bought dozens of buildings and evicted thousands of tenants, many of them black and Hispanic. The 1968 rebellion came to focus on a gymnasium that Columbia planned to build in Morningside Park, and resentment in the surrounding community also focused on the university's growth on Morningside Heights, the area north, west and south of the main campus. In 1969 the Cox Commission, a fact-finding board appointed by the faculty after the 1968 disturbance, criticized the administration of Columbia's president, Grayson Kirk, for "unhealthy relations" with the community and the way the university had expanded.
Today, Columbia is by far the largest landlord in the area. It owns nearly half the commercial space between 109th and 116th Streets on Broadway, about 150 buildings in all, and officials say it plans to continue expanding and renovating its holdings. At the same time, community leaders say, the memory of 1968 continues to scar relations between Columbia and its neighbors.
"If Columbia does not do more to scale down that perception of arrogance, it is going to get worse," said the Rev. Glen C. Missick, 47, pastor of the Church of the Master at Morningside Avenue and 121st Street, which faces the campus. "It's a class thing and, yes, it's a race thing."
Lloyd A. Williams, 48, president of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce, said: "The feeling was and is that Columbia is an isolated community that doesn't want people of color living near them. Anyone who wanted to strike a match in 1968 would have gotten a flame."
But those same community leaders and others also say that Columbia's president since 1993, George Rupp, and his administration have tried to be more open, consulting widely with neighborhood groups on the campus's real estate strategy on Morningside Heights.
In 1968, John T. Herbert was one of the 40 or more black students who occupied Hamilton Hall, the administrative center of Columbia College. "George Rupp and his administration have set a tone, a positive tone," said Dr. Herbert, 50, the director of anesthesiology at Harlem Hospital Center, which is affiliated with Columbia. "But there is still more to be done."
That is a contention with which Columbia's executive vice president for administration, Emily Lloyd, 53, agrees. "Cataclysmic events are always etched in memory," she said. "But perception of change always lags the change."
Columbia had been buying buildings near its core campus since 1919, but according to Andrew S. Dolkart, author of "Morningside Heights: A History of Its Architecture and Development," to be published by Columbia University Press, it accelerated its purchases in the 1950's and 60's because university administrators were becoming alarmed about the transformation of parts of West Harlem and Morningside Heights from a middle-class community to a poor community, where unemployment, crime and deteriorating housing were becoming significant problems. "Administrators were worried that people would not want to come to their school anymore," said Mr. Dolkart, a part-time historical consultant to Columbia.
The university started buying buildings, in part to stem their deterioration and in part to accommodate its own growth, Mr. Dolkart said, but it appeared to do little to explain its larger purposes to those affected by its purchases. Marie Runyon, a political activist and mother of a 7-year-old daughter, remembers the eviction notice placed on her 24-unit, six-story apartment building at 130 Morningside Drive in 1961.
"The sign said: 'This building is coming down to make way for the Columbia College of Pharmacy. Prepare to move immediately. 130 Holding Corp.,' " Ms. Runyon recalled. "Only later did we find out it was Columbia. They were evicting us under an assumed name!"
What followed for Ms. Runyon and 23 other families was five years of demonstrations and successful court actions: She and others continue to live in the building. But tenants elsewhere were less lucky. "There must have been thousands of evictions," said Ms. Runyon, now 83, "most of them successful and none of them publicized."
Indeed, Ms. Runyon said that Ronald E. Golden, a senior official in Columbia's office of real estate from 1965 to 1987 and the person who oversaw much of the university's expansion and evictions, came to be known as "the most hated man in all of Morningside Heights." Mr. Golden did not return calls seeking comment.
By February 1968, when Columbia began building the gymnasium, the university had become a divisive symbol. "We saw Columbia expanding into Morningside Park as imperialism and colonialism writ small," said James S. Kunen, 49, a student activist who wrote "The Strawbery Statement," a widely read 1969 account of the rebellion. Like the United States in Vietnam, Mr. Kunen said, "Columbia was taking advantage of a weaker, darker people."
Columbia's gymnasium was to be built on public park land, although the public would have limited access to it. In 1961, Columbia had signed a 50-year lease with the city to rent the land in Morningside Park at $3,000 a year. The gym was to have two tiers, the larger top tier for the university and the smaller lower tier for the public, meaning, in effect, Harlem. "From Morningside Drive, it was to look like a Greek temple," said Bob Roistacher, 54, a demonstrator at Columbia and now chairman of the Morningside Heights Residents' Association. "From Morningside Avenue, it was to look like a bunker."
The university never built the gymnasium, and Dr. Kirk, who died this year, took early retirement as university president four months after the demonstrations.
"We stopped Columbia cold," said William W. Sales Jr., 55, a leader of the Hamilton Hall occupation and now chairman of the department of African-American studies at Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J.
Today, Morningside Park is a seemingly pleasant patch of green between Morningside Avenue and Morningside Drive, but drug use and crimes of assault are common there. Periodically, Mr. Missick and volunteers sweep through the park to gather used needles, so families can sit on the grass. "But there's always more needles," he said. "Always."
Mr. Missick noted that Mr. Rupp, Columbia's president, is, like himself, an ordained Presbyterian minister. "I cannot but hold him to a higher standard than any other president of Columbia," he said. "By helping us, he is helping the school."

Meet the Fish That Might Save Seattle

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
NEAR the end of a recent lovefest for endangered salmon, with corporate titans joining environmental leaders and politicians to announce their goal of rescuing a West Coast icon before it becomes extinct, came one jarring note.
"And what do you most like about salmon?" Gov. Gary Locke of Washington asked schoolchildren who had been brought before the cameras to make the case about one generation's responsibility to the next. 
 "I like to catch them," said an 8-year-old boy, "and I like to eat them."
There's nothing like an honest, old-fashioned assertion of humanity's place atop the food chain to put an environmental challenge in perspective. But in the days leading up to Earth Day, which falls on Wednesday, a new sense of environmental self-interest seems to be taking hold.
While the Endangered Species Act, the most powerful environmental law in the land, may have been created to save salmon, owls and butterflies, many policy makers are now arguing that it may really be about saving us, the dominant species.
As Seattle Mayor Paul Schell put it, in a bit of political haiku, "Ironically, as we work together to save the salmon, it may turn out that the salmon saves us."
 
Keeping Things in Check
The salmon may do for Seattle what the striped bass did for New York City: check unbridled urban development. Concern over a landfill in the Hudson River that threatened the fish's habitat eventually scuttled a riverfront highway project. In the same vein, Seattle's quality of life is now threatened by a bulging metropolitan area, and the Endangered Species Act may be just the thing to keep the city's growth in check.
Think globally, act locally, has worked fine as a refrain, spawning recycling, chemical-free backyards and earth-friendly corporate labels. But in trying to persuade Americans to sacrifice in the name of a cleaner globe, some environmentalists say appeals to altruism can only go so far.
The debate over saving ancient forests took a marked turn when it was discovered that in the process of leveling national forests, loggers were not only destroying the habitat of the endangered spotted owls but also the Pacific yew tree, which contains a substance used in one of the most promising drugs for the treatment of breast cancer. The argument suddenly became one about a medical hope for despairing women.
Similarly, this month it was reported that one out of every three plant species in America, and one out of every eight in the world, is threatened with extinction by human activities. The report is a biodiversity four-alarm fire, though that term is still largely an abstraction to most people.
The coalition of scientists and environmentalists at the World Conservation Union who conducted the survey were quick to explain: most medicine comes from wild plants. Lose them, and lose potential cures for cancer.
"I still think we're better off appealing to principles rather than, say, economics," said Dennis Hayes, founder of the original Earth Day in 1970, and now president of the Bullitt Foundation, a well-endowed environmental group here. "But it does seem like the people who are most fanatical about saving something like salmon are those who really like to eat them."
There was a great furor from developers around Austin, Texas, and in Southern California a few years ago when Federal officials said they would restrict urban sprawl to protect vanishing bird species. But homeowners discovered that the bonus of open space led to an increase in their property values. What was good for the dying birds turned out to be good for home equity.
The critics of environmental restoration insist that the Endangered Species Act and other laws have elevated plant and animal concerns to a high altar of eco worship. "Laws of the beetle, by the beetle and for the beetle" is how Representative Helen Chenoweth, Republican of Idaho, described the species act.
But recent polls in the Pacific Northwest suggest that a large majority of people see something in it for them in the effort to save the region's signature fish. They are willing to pay more in utility or water bills to bring salmon back to rivers.
The attempt to save wild salmon on the West Coast is the most ambitious effort yet to try to restore a natural system to large urban areas. In the Puget Sound region, nearly three million people live in an area where many strains of chinook salmon are close to extinction. The effort to bring those fish back may force restrictions on everything from lawn care to future expansion of companies like Boeing and Microsoft.
"Ultimately, we're talking about real changes in people's lives," said Tryg Sletteland, director of Pacific Rivers Council, a Oregon-based environmental group. "We're talking about limiting growth, increasing housing density and limiting traffic."
 
Wretched Urban Excess
Cities elsewhere are attempting to do the same thing. Denver, now nearly 500 square miles, is trying to reign in some of its runaway growth. But without a federally sanctified icon like salmon, the city has had to make a general appeal to protect the Rocky Mountain good life. Only as traffic has worsened in the metropolitan area have some of those appeals hit home, Colorado's city planners say.
Even Las Vegas, the fastest-growing city in the country and the epitome of wretched urban excess, has tried to save wild plants and animals by appealing to the self-interest of its citizens. In signing a conservation plan last week to protect the Palmers chipmunk and Clokey's eggvetch, a plant, in the Spring Mountains just outside Las Vegas City limits, elected officials talked about the great thrill and tourist draw it would be to go out for an afternoon of nature out of range of a slot machine or blackjack table.
Underlying the nation's latest conservation efforts is the basic assumption -- let's save the salmon, kids! -- as old as any American virtue. In outlining his plans to green groups for a millennial campaign for Earth Day, Mr. Hayes managed to refer indirectly to someone not usually mentioned in environmental circles.
"Earth Day 2000 will be almost Reaganesque in optimism," he said. "Humans made these problems. We can decide to do something different."
But the more daunting question is whether land that has been been sealed by pavement, crammed with skyscrapers and had its genetic bank plundered can ever again respond to the laws of nature. The answer, from people like Governor Locke, is -- yes. And then Americans can go back to doing the things they take for granted in the natural world.
At the salmon meeting, for example, the Governor spoke of the need to restore biodiversity, to protect quality of life, to keep the economy humming. Then he mentioned his own stake in the issue. "Just as my dad took me salmon fishing on Puget Sound," he said, "I want to be able to do the same with my daughter Emily."

How Big Banks See the World

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
ATTENTION, shoppers: Some of America's biggest banks think it is time you stopped foraging around for necessities like credit cards, mortgages, insurance and checking accounts and just got all those financial goodies in one place: Theirs.
Big bank mergers are afoot -- linking titans like BankAmerica with Nationsbank, Banc One with First Chicago and Citicorp with Travelers Group -- and one of the Big Ideas behind them is that consumers will embrace the concept of one-stop shopping for financial services. Other companies, like Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund giant, and Merrill Lynch, the nation's leading brokerage firm, are pursuing similar strategies. 
 "It's a business proposition whose time has come," Citicorp's chief executive, John S. Reed, said on April 6, when his company's merger with Travelers was announced. Mr. Reed said that customers in the future would not "want to go from place to place" to manage their personal finances.
Should a savvy consumer buy into this argument? Some already do.
"It's kind of nice to have one statement and to have access to all of your money with one phone call," said David Dillon, a 34-year-old Chicagoan who trades stocks and keeps his savings and checking accounts with Fidelity. "And from what I can tell, the prices and interest rates are competitive. Everybody's within a fraction of one another."
Well, not exactly. A little searching -- and, in some cases, a willingness to use the latest technology -- can unearth much better deals than those offered by the expanding giants.
Fidelity charges a $14.95 commission per stock trade for active traders and $19.95 a trade for those who buy and sell less often. In comparison, Ameritrade, an on-line brokerage, charges $8 a trade. And while Travelers charges an average auto insurance premium of about $925 a year for a 35-year-old male in Manhattan, Electric Insurance charges $456 for the same policy. Not even all big banks are equal. Citicorp charges an interest rate of 16.25 percent on a two-year, unsecured personal loan, while the Chase Manhattan Corporation charges about 11 percent for an equivalent loan.
Of course, the potential savings may look small to consumers willing to pay extra for the convenience of getting one financial statement a month that neatly ties their far-flung money management needs into one package. And some banks, such as Citicorp, negotiate many of their fees downward if you pledge allegiance and concentrate your personal finances with them; for example, that personal loan from Citibank can fall to 12.25 percent for one-stop shoppers.
Large banks are not exploring one-stop shopping on a lark. They are all in need of finding new ways to do business. Hemmed in for years by arcane regulations that did not apply to many of their competitors, and often too conservative in their own managerial styles, banks have seen many of their most profitable businesses picked off by specialists like brokerage firms, credit-card companies and mutual fund families. Banks also labor under the longstanding perception that they are more akin to public trusts than businesses. This sometimes saddles them with customers who willingly fork over $30 a month for cable television or $20 a month for on-line computer services, but squirm at a few extra dollars a month for banking.
So being all things to all people, and charging for that service, is one way that banks feel they can restoke their competitive juices. But predicting what appeals to consumers when it comes to managing their personal finances is as much an art as it is a science.
"When we look at consumer behavior and how people bank, there is no such thing as an average consumer," said James McCormick, president of First Manhattan Consulting Group. "It's a world of widely disparate behaviors."
CONSUMERS like Mr. Dillon -- those willing to bundle most of their financial needs with one supplier -- account for perhaps 20 percent of all customers of financial services concerns, Mr. McCormick said. The vast bulk of customers are more like Rita Buland, a secretary in Manhattan. Ms. Buland follows the advice of the old Motown hit by the Miracles: She shops around.
"I would not do anything but banking at a bank," Ms. Buland said. "I worked for many years in a medical center. I learned not to take my body or my money to a general practitioner."
In fact, banking experts say, it is discriminating, finnicky shoppers like Ms. Buland who are forcing the financial services world to change. The model, these gurus say, may be the retailing industry. In the future there will be a few very powerful national vendors with broad product lines, like Wal-Mart. (The new Citigroup, for example.) There will be very big, specialized companies, like Home Depot. (Charles Schwab, perhaps.) And there will be room for small, very local providers of highly personalized service, like the dry cleaner on the corner. (Think of community banks and credit unions, for instance.)
Over the last decade, the winners in financial services have been the category killers. These include specialized companies like MBNA in credit cards, Countrywide Credit in mortgages and Geico in auto insurance. These organizations used technology to lower their costs and they improved their marketing, thereby taking customers from their more traditional counterparts in the staid banking world.
"Customers are learning to expect more for less," said Scott M. Birnbaum, a consumer banking expert with Mercer Management Consulting. "Intense competition and new technology are making better products and better service."
The financial services companies that are pairing up in the latest round of mergers want to trump the category killers by offering financial consumers the convenience of the shopping mall. The trouble is that there is little evidence that big companies can sell myriad financial products to all their customers.
"Every decade in banking, people talk about cross-marketing," said Shailesh J. Mehta, chairman of the Providian Financial Corporation. "We just haven't seen anyone with a successful formula."
It's not that Providian hasn't tried itself. Originally an insurance company, it expanded into credit cards, then spent years pushing its various divisions to sell one another's products -- without much success. In retrospect, Mr. Mehta said, the company's experience in insurance should have offered a cautionary tale.
"Eighty percent of the life insurance agents never sold an auto policy," he said. "And 70 percent never sold a health policy. What says making the insurance policy part of a bank is going to change that?"
His conclusion? "You can't push the consumer around." And so Providian sold its insurance operations last year to concentrate on consumer lending. "We found we could create greater shareholder wealth picking one market and focusing on it rather than trying to be everything to everybody," he said.
Providian's experience is common across nearly every financial category.
"Typically, families in the top half of the income structure deal with between 5 and 10 financial firms," said Scott Cook, chairman of Intuit Inc., the maker of Quicken software. "Commonly, they choose to get their credit card, mortgage, checking account and mutual funds from different firms, even when their bank offers all four product lines."
Demographics play a significant role in all of this, and time appears to be on the side of companies arguing for financial supermarkets. One-stop shoppers tend to be people younger than 40. Analysts and corporate executives say that it is those older than 40 who have a more jaundiced view of banks.
"The World War II generation has a healthy disrespect for the financial system, based on their experience as kids in the Depression, and they have passed a bit of that on to their children, the baby boomers," said Stephen A. Cone, president of Fidelity's consumer marketing division. "As that memory trails off, people are much more receptive to the idea of one-stop shopping."
YET before megabankers rejoice at this generational shift, they should pause to consider a technological development whose potential is still unfolding: the Internet. While younger people may have an affinity for bundling, they are also the most adept at using the technology that can make one-stop shopping much less necessary. The Internet allows customers to retrieve lots of detailed financial information quickly and makes moving their business among vendors that much easier.
"It doesn't matter any more how big you are," Mr. Cone said. "It matters whether people are going to your Web site."
Using a software package like Quicken, for example, a person can build electronic links to bank accounts at Citibank, credit cards from American Express and investments from Schwab. Intuit is taking this approach much further, creating electronic search engines that will take information from a given user to shop the World Wide Web for the best financial deals. For example, it will use a person's car model and driving record to find the lowest price on an auto insurance policy.
"Shopping financial alternatives is usually hard today," Mr. Cook said. "The Internet makes financial shopping a cinch -- fast and free to do. Why would you pay more money to switch to your bank's captive insurance arm?"
THE evolution of on-line stock brokerage services may provide devotees of financial supermarkets with a sobering indicator of what can happen when consumers begin to surf the Internet with gusto in their quest for cheaper financial products.
Today, according to Piper Jaffrey, nearly 20 percent of all stock trades by individuals are entered over the Internet, from a standing start four years ago. The going commission for such trades is about $16, far below the prices charged by full-service brokers and less than the cost at many discount brokers.
Indeed, Charles Schwab, long the bane of full-service brokers, is now fighting off competition from Internet brokers, like Ameritrade and the E-Trade Group, that are undercutting its price. Last Wednesday, Schwab posted first-quarter earnings that were below expectations because of price cuts that it took to be more competitive.
On Internet time, the competitive cycle spins ever faster, a boon to consumers willing to shop around. E-Trade's $15 commissions are being undercut by firms charging as little as $5 a trade. And that is prompting E-Trade to adopt the same strategy as some of the financial giants with which it competes.
Christos M. Cotsakos, chief executive of E-Trade, based in Palo Alto, Calif., argues that his upstart company has established enough of a brand reputation that it no longer has to compete by offering the lowest price.
"There are some people where price is all that matters, and they have no loyalty," Mr. Cotsakos said. "But there is a middle kingdom where brand is important, as long as you aren't charging them $300 for something they can get for $14.95."
E-Trade has climbed firmly aboard the one-stop-shopping bandwagon, with plans to introduce credit and debit cards. And already, it looks a lot like a bank, with $1.3 billion in cash balances from customers. Some 30 percent of E-Trade's customers have their paychecks electronically deposited into the money-market portion of their brokerage accounts.
Banks, of course, can exploit the Internet themselves, but so far they haven't found it easy. Citibank already offers on-line stock trades for $19.95, although critics say that its slow and unwieldy Web site is no match for either E-Trade's or Schwab's. There have been a handful of all-electronic banks, but they have attracted few customers.
The new financial Goliaths won't have any trouble deploying their ample resources to build fancy Web sites and invest in any other technology that might make it easier to reel in new customers. Yet banks historically have tripped over their own size, finding it hard to remain agile and respond to market changes quickly as the financial ground shifted beneath their feet.
If quaint notions like personal service remain in demand, bankers still have all those branches on street corners that they can convert into mini-malls. But experts say that older consumers who prefer banking in branches, rather than on the Internet, the telephone or with automated teller machines, tend not to be interested in one-stop shopping. And they may not understand that the new products do not come with guarantees from the Federal Government.
"Banks have held a special place in consumers' minds as companies they can trust because of things like deposit insurance," said Mary Griffin, legal counsel for Consumers Union, the nonprofit organization that publishes Consumer Reports magazine. "Because of that trust, it can be easy for banks to deceive and mislead people."
Last year, Nationsbank, without admitting or denying guilt, paid $30 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the bank of duping hundreds of thousands of customers in eight states into buying mutual funds and stocks by falsely portraying those products as being federally insured.
"We vigorously denied the allegations, and we're confident our investment consultants fully disclosed all risks associated with those products," said Ann Anderson, a Nationsbank spokeswoman. "But rather than engage in protracted litigation, we chose to settle and put the matter behind us."
CUSTOMERS, though, may not be so quick to put their frustrations behind them when mergers go awry. Bollixed-up statements and tangled phone-mail trees can quickly repel once-loyal customers.
Nor does brand loyalty survive every merger. New Sub Services, a company that sells magazine subscriptions through inserts in credit card bills, says offers from big national banks with well-known names get 20 to 50 percent more responses than similar offerings from regional banks. But that advantage turns to a disadvantage if the big bank buys the small bank and slaps its name on customers' credit cards. Customers tend to bolt when that happens, New Sub says.
So if consumers of financial services are proving to behave more like wolves than sheep, they should be heartened to realize that for all the hand-wringing about megamergers, there will still be abundant choices for customers on the prowl. The combination of Nationsbank and BankAmerica will create an enormous bank, but one that still will control only a little more than 8 percent of the nation's bank deposits.
But if Nationsbank and BankAmerica were to link up with Citicorp and Travelers . . .

Feeding the New Work Ethic

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
MOST lotteries offer such low odds of winning that they invite comparisons to rare lightning strikes. But there's a new lottery with terrific odds and lots of winners: It's called Corporate America.
As much as this month's huge mergers were about restructuring the financial-services industry, the deals also had the happy-go-lucky feel of a windfall celebration. When the Citicorp-Travelers Group merger was announced two weeks ago, John S. Reed, the Citicorp chairman, was asked how he reacted when his counterpart at Travelers first proposed the merger just five weeks earlier. "My instinct," Mr. Reed said, "was to say, 'Why not?' " 
 Why not, indeed. Details of the merger, including concerns from industry regulators, could be handled later: It was time for the C.E.O.'s to enjoy the sight of jaws dropping on their surprising news, and to watch stock-price jumps add $67 million in paper profits in a single day to Mr. Reed's holdings of Citicorp stock, and $248 million to the Travelers stock held by Sanford I. Weill, its chairman.
"This is a bigger opportunity for everybody who is part of it," Mr. Weill said the day of his merger announcement.
He could just as easily have been talking about all the people who are taking part in the broader stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed from 2,000 to over 9,000 over the last decade, generating pronouncements from market watchers that a fundamental shift has occurred in the way people invest. With so much at stake -- the proportion of Americans' wealth tied up in stocks, about 28 percent, is at a 50-year high -- bad market news is always lined with at least some silver, if not gold. Stock drops are viewed by many as just opportunities to buy, as are giant mergers.
The obvious route to playing this big lottery is buying stock. But there is an even better lottery ticket, one that appears to cost nothing and is spreading deeply through the ranks of many companies: stock options.
These options, which are typically issued in addition to salary and bonus, grant the right to buy a company's shares at a set price for a set period of time -- meaning the chance to buy stock at a discount if the share price rises. Options used to be given only to top executives, but they are now handed out to roughly 50 percent of midlevel professionals at major companies, and many surveys show that at least 1 in 10 of the companies offer them to most of their employees.
In fact, options have become a kind of currency beyond a company's walls: as part of Jerry Seinfeld's last contract, he got stock options in NBC's parent company, General Electric. One reason options are doled out so freely is that, because of favorable accounting rules, they don't show up as a charge against a company's earnings. And because they only pay off if the stock rises, companies like to think of them as risk-free investments.
When combined with the surging stock market, these options have created unexpected wealth, on paper and in real dollars, for legions of employees. Many see the granting of options to all ranks of workers as a laudably egalitarian approach to allowing employees to share in their company's prosperity. But there have also been some striking side effects.
With so many rich option profits, the gap is widening in American society between those who hold stocks and stock options and those who are left out of the market lottery. Options can also create a disconnect between the effort people put into their jobs and the pay they receive for it. In Silicon Valley, many workers job-hop as they search for the one company where the options will pay off as well as they have for those who are now among the many "Microsoft millionaires."
The gap between pay and effort can be especially wide for chief executives, who get huge grants of stock options for reasons that appear to have very little to do with the size or performance of their companies. For those at the top, even a relatively small uptick in the stock price can translate into millions of dollars in paper profits.
Many chief executives have blunted resentment of their rich option packages by sprinkling options through their company's ranks. But when the stock drops sharply -- yes, it does happen at a lot of companies -- the C.E.O. may suddenly be blamed for wiping out part of employees' anticipated savings from cashing in the options.
Further widening the gap between pay and effort, many companies lower the price of options when their share price falls steadily, effectively lowering the bar over which employees must jump for the options to pay off. The practice, known as "repricing," infuriates many outside investors, who say that repricing can have the perverse effect of rewarding poor performance.
 
License to Churn
Given that there is no real downside to stock options, it is perhaps not surprising that big option packages provide an incentive for chief executives to experiment more freely with ways to lift their companies' stock price. William Gerard Sanders, a professor of strategic management at Brigham Young University, studied 250 large American companies from 1991 to 1995, and found that large stock-option holdings for top executives tended to increase the frequency of acquisitions and divestitures -- "symbolic churning," as Mr. Sanders called it -- to get stock prices up.
"Option pay," Mr. Sanders said, "essentially grants the executive a potential winning ticket in a compensation lottery."
It is a lottery that many people are rushing to join, particularly in high-technology companies where stock options are standard equipment in most pay packages. The vigorous economy in Silicon Valley, for example, has given options something of a public-relations halo -- employees with options ideally feel more like owners, and have an incentive to work through the night. At big companies, however, many lower level workers don't quite know what they can do differently to help lift the stock price -- except, at consumer-goods companies, maybe buying more of their company's own products.
"People become enfranchised with stock options, and I think the work ethic in high-technology companies can be tremendously accelerated," said Jim Trattner, who runs the Trattner Network and Talentwave, two companies based near San Francisco that place executives and provide contract help to technology companies (Mr. Trattner's companies also take stock options from clients as part of their fees.)
But Mr. Trattner, a former clinical and industrial psychologist, said the proliferation of stock options among technology companies had caused another change that he does not necessarily applaud.
"I'm old enough to say that there used to be a sort of intrinsic motivation to do something for the love of it," said Mr. Trattner, who is 59.
"Now," he added, "it's like, 'Let's make a buck,' and I think there is something lost in that."

50 Years Ago in Israel: Trying to Imagine the Future

BYLINE: By MARC D. CHARNEY 

 BODY:
BY declaring itself independent 50 years ago, Israel announced its intention to give Jews a new future. The past, especially the still gaping wound of genocide, had been too terrible. So there was a great temptation to peer into the future and imagine what it held.
Israel was a child whose birth had been long anticipated by many: visionary thinkers, socialists, nationalists, religious leaders, guerrilla fighters, foreign diplomats, desperate refugees. Everyone had a different idea of what form the future would take; any one vision might capture a sliver of the picture, but none seemed to see it whole. 
 One prediction was easy: There would be war. The outcome, and the shape of Israeli society, was another matter.
It was easy to see the besieged nation absorbing huge numbers of immigrants. But few saw how long the siege would last, or how divided Israel would become over the search for peace, and over social and religious issues.
Professor Michael Stanislawski of Columbia University, a specialist in Israeli history, says that Israel's founding fathers shared a faith that they were witnessing the "normalization" of the Jewish people in a new melting pot after the centuries in exile. The country's population today, and the depth of its internal disputes, would surely surprise them, he says.
Here then is a look at some early visions offered up for Israel. They share two things: Each begins with a shrewd observation, but none is completely right.
In 1902, the founder of modern Zionism, Theodor Herzl, wrote a utopian novel, "Altneuland" ("Old-New Land"), in which a Jewish Palestine was a hub of global commerce:
Europe is nearer to Palestine than to America. . . . You can now go by rail from any place in Europe to Damascus, Jerusalem and Baghdad . . . The Cape-to-Cairo line . . . has now been built, and so has the Trans-Siberian line to China, thus completing a network of which we are nearly the center.
In the late 1930's Zionists fruitlessly tried to persuade Britain to permit large-scale immigration to Palestine despite violent Arab opposition. A royal commission led by Earl Peel heard Chaim Weizmann, the leader of mainstream Zionism, in Jerusalem on Nov. 25, 1936:
There should be one place in the world, in God's wide world, where we could live and express ourselves in accordance with our character, and make our contribution . . . We would not have to be always on the defensive, or, on the contrary, become too aggressive, as always happens with a minority which is constantly on the defensive. . . .
If we do not employ Arab labor, it is thrown in our faces: "You come into the country and you do not employ the labor for the country which is already there." And if we do employ Arab labor, we are likely to lay ourselves open to the reproach: "Here they are, they come and live here, and the real work is being done by others, while they are simply overlords" . . . I hope we may be able to find a way by which Arabs may employ Jews in larger numbers, and Jews may employ Arabs in large numbers.
 
An Arab Minority
 Vladimir Jabotinsky, the militant right-wing rival of the mainstream Zionists, also spoke about relations with the Arabs, appearing before the Peel Commission on Feb. 11, 1937:
The idea is that Palestine on both sides of the Jordan should hold the Arabs, their progeny and many millions of Jews. What I do not deny is that in that process the Arabs of Palestine will necessarily become a minority in the country of Palestine. What I do deny is that that is a hardship.
 In 1948, as Jews prepared for the end of Britain's Palestine mandate at midnight on May 14, the United States State Department sought to have President Truman keep the land under United Nations trusteeship rather than immediately recognize a new Jewish state -- which Truman did anyway. A memorandum of Jan. 20, 1948, from the State Department's policy planning staff, led by George F. Kennan, forecast:
Ultimately the U.S. might have to support the Jewish authorities by the use of naval units and military forces . . . It is improbable that the Jewish state could survive over any considerable period of time in the face of the combined assistance which would be forthcoming for the Arabs in Palestine from the Arab States, and in lesser measure from their Moslem neighbors.
On the day of independence, Dr. Weizmann spoke to Israel's Jews in a radiogram from New York, where he had been involved in the frantic diplomacy:
OUR FOREFATHERS BUILT WITH ONE HAND WHILE DEFENDING THEMSELVES WITH OTHER STOP WE CALLED UPON TODAY ACT IN THIS TRADITION STOP IT IS PROFOUND DESIRE OUR PEOPLE ESTABLISH RELATIONS HARMONY AND MUTUAL RESPECT WITH THEIR ARAB FELLOW CITIZENS WITH NEIGHBORING ARAB STATES AND WITH ALL OTHER NATIONS IN HUMAN FAMILY STOP
The next night, Menachem Begin, who came to lead the militant right after the death of Jabotinsky in 1940, spoke over the radio of the Irgun guerrilla group.
It is Hebrew arms which decide the boundaries of the Hebrew State. So it is now in this battle; so it will be in the future.
When a cease-fire was declared after Israelis won initial victories in the 1948 war, Abba Eban, Israel's representative at the United Nations, made an appeal for good relations with the Arabs in an article in the September 1948 issue of Commentary:
Arabs and Jews need each other for any progress or any escape from deadlock . . . the salient new fact created since May 14 is that the Arab world must either seek an adjustment with Israel or sink ever deeper into a mire of international discredit, social disturbance and political upheaval . . . If self-interest is even a subsidiary motive of political action, then Arabs must come to the conference table soon.
And what would happen now inside Israel? David Ben-Gurion, a principal exponent of the secular socialist ethics that many Zionists had brought from eastern Europe, addressed Kibbutz Hameukhad, invoking the spirit of the halutz, or Zionist pioneer, who was central to his vision:
Human freedom is the primary attribute of a halutz . . . A second attribute is equality . . . A third attribute -- perhaps the most important one -- is human cooperation, which means faith in the community, a bond with it and the will to pioneering unity.
The ultra-Orthodox leaders had something else in mind as a source of ethics; Rabbi J.Z. Dushinsky, representing the anti-Zionist group Agudath Israel -- which would later join Ben-Gurion's coalition -- described it to the Peel Commission, sitting in London, on Dec. 21, 1936:
The holy Torah has promised the Holy Land to the people of Israel, but it is by that very Torah that we are commanded not to occupy the country by force . . . but we are confident that to the extent that the returning exiles to Zion will fulfill the will of God, as revealed in the Torah, and will make the national home the abode of the Torah in all branches of economic and cultural endeavor . . .
 Sir Horace Rumbold questioned him:
Q. There should be a proportion of members of Agudath Israel employed in the posts and in the railways, but you also object to their working on Saturdays?
A: Yes.
Q: Do you not see what that leads to? . . . The railways certainly are an important element in the economic life of the country . . . do you not think that is going to make it rather difficult?
A: They will be run by Arabs on Saturdays, by non-Jews. On Saturdays the work can be done by non-Jews.
A week later, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, president of the Jewish community's executive council, described how Palestine's various immigrant populations got along:
The Jewish population is united in religion, language and a common purpose and identifies itself with the aspirations and purpose of the Jewish national home. There is no difference on this score between the immigrants from European countries, such as Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia, and those who came from Asiatic countries, such as the Yemen, Iran or Kurdistan.
On April 22, 1949, just 13 years later, a controversial article appeared in the newspaper Haaretz. The writer, Arye Gelblum, described immigrants from North Africa as dirty, disease ridden and prone to drunkenness and prostitution:
And then, other Oriental Jews will eventually join them, too! What will happen to the State of Israel and its standards with this type of population? Obviously all these Jews are entitled to come here no less than others, and they should be brought over and absorbed, but if it is carried out without consideration for our limited capacities and if it is not done gradually, they will "absorb" us rather than we them.
If such social tensions were not on people's minds while Israel was fighting to survive, one widespread hope was that warfare would end soon. The popular singer Shoshana Damari entertained troops with a song of the risk and promise of battle:
. . . From the roads leading south
A platoon returns from battle.
As stars fade it shall return from night,
The desert stretching primordial and vast,
Smile, sister, we have returned from our plight --
This battle was the last.

HEADLINE: The World;
In Ireland, Courage and Good Timing

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Northern Ireland peace agreement, framed with such difficulty out of so many years of hatred and mistrust, was itself an accident of timing. Its implementation will require a similar mixture of bravery and luck.
Some sort of settlement was going to happen sometime, as it will also happen, sometime, in the Middle East. But this triumph benefited as much from the confluence of unpredictable events as from the courage of the participants. 
 Thirty years of vicious and personalized killings, one by one, since the Troubles began again in earnest in 1969, built a solid sense of disgust among most in Northern Ireland, Protestant and Catholic. That disgust, combined with a comparative economic boom in both Britain and the Irish Republic, made the violence seem that much more self-defeating and antique, particularly among younger people with an increasingly European sense of themselves and their future.
But disgust has never been enough to stop the killing in Northern Ireland. It still required acts of imagination and courage from political leaders -- including President Clinton. He had already reached out to the Catholic side to grant a visa to the Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in early 1994, ignoring the protests of Britain and his own Cabinet.
Mr. Clinton was also willing to fold the easy domestic card of Irish republicanism and reach out to the Ulster Unionists and their young leader, David Trimble, giving them similar access to the American Government. The result was a lessening of suspicion of Mr. Clinton's motives -- and those of his special envoy, the former Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, who chaired these talks.
Even the aging revolutionaries of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, had grown weary and fearful for their own children. So when Mr. Adams got his visa, he was ready to use the credibility Mr. Clinton provided to persuade the I.R.A. to forswear violence for a seat at the negotiating table.
Much important work had been done by the former Conservative Prime Minister of Britain, John Major. Still, the pact probably would not have happened without the election of a new Labor Prime Minister, Tony Blair. He had a huge majority, a willingness to spend political capital early and new ideas about sovereignty and the decentralization of power.
 
When Success Is Failure
For Mr. Mitchell, the satisfaction of orchestrating an agreement under the pressure of a deadline is muted only by his continuing astonishment at the ability of the participants to think the worst of one another.
"One of their worst practices is that each party judges success by the failure of the others," Mr. Mitchell said in an interview here. "If Trimble feels success, Adams feels failure. So every decision became a zero-sum game." Matters got so bad in the all-day, all-night marathon that Mr. Mitchell and the two Prime Ministers, Mr. Blair and Ireland's Bertie Ahern, drafted language they called "the mutual assured destruction paragraph.
Mr. Adams was convinced that Mr. Trimble would insure that the North-South consultative bodies, which give Dublin a small say in the running of the north, would be delayed or killed by the Northern Ireland Assembly, where Mr. Trimble's party would be a majority. Mr. Trimble was convinced that Mr. Adams wanted to delay the establishment and functioning of the Assembly.
In the end, with Mr. Clinton's help of advice and jaw-boning with all the parties, a compromise was reached out to insure that the North-South bodies would hold a round of meetings before the Assembly was constituted, expected to be by February 1999. And the "mutual assured destruction paragraph" was drafted to say that if one body does not function, neither does the other.
Mr. Mitchell sees dangers to the agreement in the likelihood of violence from fringe militants on both sides who want to derail the deal, and the unavoidable risk that the agreement might be rejected in simultaneous referendums in both parts of Ireland on May 22 -- although opinion polls show sizeable majorities in favor.
 
Delicate Issues
But more important, the implementation of a complicated set of arrangements will be difficult. They include the delicate issues of police reform, turning in of arms by militants, the freeing of prisoners and the establishment of the Assembly and North-South bodies, both of which must deliver increased prosperity and justice to the citizens of the North, especially the Catholic minority.
That will require that the new Unionist willingness to transcend the parochialism of the past be matched by a new generosity toward the Catholics, who have given up the idea of a united Ireland through any means but the consent of the majority population of the North.
There are hopeful signs. "Gerry Adams and Sinn Fein have been brought in from the cold," notes Padraig O'Malley of the University of Massachusetts in Boston. "This is not peace in our time," he said. "But even if the Sinn Fein governing body were to vote against the pact, it would not produce a big split. So to that extent, the I.R.A. as we have known it in our time, is over."
And in 1973, the last time a multiparty peace deal was reached in Northern Ireland, Unionist dissenters caused the arrangement to fall apart within months. Their leader then was David Trimble.

A Wakeup Call for Workfare's Advocates

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
IN polishing his achievements in town hall meetings in Brooklyn and fund raisers as far away as Arizona, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani always mentions one that sets him apart from other politicians: His creation of the country's largest workfare program, a welfare work force of 34,000 people who sweep streets, clean parks and answer phones for their welfare checks.
But workfare, which Mr. Giuliani once hoped would become a model for the nation, is a program officials elsewhere are largely avoiding. Most of them view it as a last resort, a program that is costly and typically fails to moves people into real jobs. And while they admire the sheer size of Mr. Giuliani's work force, most officials are focusing on programs that will push people into the job market faster and for a longer time than municipal programs like New York City's Work Experience Program, as workfare is called. 
 "They want to get people working," said Jack Tweedie, who tracks welfare policy across the country for the National Conference of State Legislatures. "And the research suggests that workfare is not that successful in getting people off welfare and into jobs."
In the past Mr. Giuliani has said that as many as 110,000 workfare workers had found real jobs. But he and city officials rarely measure workfare's success by the number of participants who find employment.
Those officials say their program has helped reduce the welfare caseload by a third, getting rid of some people who worked off the books while receiving welfare checks. The officials say that participants have a new sense of responsibility, that the public, too, benefits from a cleaner city. These successes, they say, make the program invaluable.
City officials seem to place hopes for job placement elsewhere, requiring some welfare applicants to search for jobs first and offering welfare mothers school and vocational training to supplement their workfare jobs. And the same officials who called workfare the "heart and soul" of a program designed to move people off welfare are describing it as "a last resort" that best serves those with few jobs skills.
 
A Last Resort
"Workfare must be work of last resort," said Jason A. Turner, the city's new welfare chief, at a City Council meeting last month. "We're not saying everybody can go to work in the private economy. But we're saying that's our preference."
New York City is adopting strategies used elsewhere in the country. In Florida, South Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, only the least-skilled, least-educated welfare recipients end up in workfare programs.
Los Angeles, which has the nation's largest welfare caseload and the second-largest workfare program, plans to spend the next two years helping welfare mothers look for jobs, improve their education and hone vocational skills, in an attempt to keep them off workfare. Los Angeles County has also begun to offer job search services to single adults.
But policy makers who have shunned workfare are watching New York City's experiment keenly and with some foreboding. The experiences in the city, where the unemployment rate is 9.2 percent -- or nearly double the national average -- may well reflect their own futures, they say.
"Our first choice is to see if people can be placed in jobs," said Don Taylor, executive director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services, who has worked aggressively to keep workfare a tiny part of his state's welfare program. "But if we end up with high unemployment and the jobs simply aren't there, we may have no other recourse."
Critics of the Giuliani administration acknowledge that the city would find it hard to comply with new Federal and state rules without workfare. Under Federal law, 30 percent of all mothers on welfare must participate in work activities by Sept. 30. That required percentage goes up 5 percent each year and stops at 50 percent. States get credit for a decline in their caseloads.
In 2001, the Federal Government will stop paying benefits to all families who were on welfare in December 1996. The New York constitution requires the state to provide for its poor, which means the state and its counties will have to absorb the cost entirely. If they want to avoid paying for people in the long run, city officials will have to move them into jobs.
Mr. Turner, the architect of Wisconsin's welfare program, said that moving New York City's welfare recipients into jobs will only get harder. Most of the people with job skills are already employed. Drug addicts, the illiterate, the unskilled and the victims of domestic violence will be much harder to place.
"They can't go further" without a major new effort, said Mr. Turner before he took the job as New York's City welfare chief in January. That task now falls to him.

'IRREGULARITIES'
Cendant's Nose Dive
Investors like company books the way Japanese like fish: uncooked. So, fairly or not, an announcement by Cendant late on Wednesday that it had discovered "potential accounting irregularities" that would force it to lower 1997 earnings of $872 million by as much as $115 million greased the skids under its stock price; on Thursday the shares plunged $16.56, or 46.5 percent, to $19.06. Even though the stock edged up $2.125 on Friday, the event was a huge embarrassment for the company's president, Henry Silverman, who won a wide following on Wall Street as he built up the HFS Corporation, which merged with CUC International in December to form Cendant. And it was costly for several big mutual funds that had sizable Cendant stakes. On Thursday, Fidelity Magellan lost 1.5 percent of its value; Morgan Stanley's institutional aggressive equity portfolio lost 5.2 percent, and the Kaufmann Fund dropped 2.8 percent. 

PEOPLE
Grounding an Ace
Robert L. Crandall, 62, the combative chairman and chief executive of American Airlines who led many industry innovations, including frequent-flier programs and sophisticated computer reservation systems, will retire next month. He will be succeeded by Donald J. Carty, the airline's president. . . . Cantor Fitzgerald, a government bond broker, is suing Iris Cantor, the widow of the firm's founder, accusing her of violating a partnership agreement. . . . If the face of the Columbia Lion is crimson, blame Robert J. Barro, left. The economist backed out of a lucrative deal offered by the university, deciding to remain at Harvard. . . . Franklin D. Raines, an architect of the Clinton Administration's balanced-budget plan, quit as the White House budget director to become chief executive of Fannie Mae.
 
MARKETS
Rebounding to a Record
Stock prices trekked through hills and valleys. The Dow Jones industrial average, after setting a new high on Wednesday, tumbled 85.70 points on Thursday before gaining 90.93 on Friday to end the week at a record 9,167.50. One negative factor was a plunge in Asian markets after the finance ministers of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations, meeting in Washington, indicated that they would not move to support the weak Japanese yen. Another was slightly disappointing earnings from Merck and a warning from Intel, whose earnings just met expectations. Both the drug and technology sectors were weak, but recovered on Friday, and the financial services sector was strong, propelled by big merger plans.
 
The I.M.F.
A Worldwide Warning
The International Monetary Fund, in an assessment of world economies, lowered its projection for world economic growth to 3.1 percent from 4.1 percent a year earlier, largely because of Japan's malaise. The group also said that the United States was likely to ride out the rest of the Asian financial crisis largely unscathed but that American stock and bond markets were increasingly vulnerable to a major fall. . . . Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin called for tough international financial disclosure rules to avert crises of the sort now roiling Asia.
 
EARNINGS
Those Smiling Brokers
Healthy earnings gains, exceeding analysts' expectations, were reported by Merrill Lynch, up 11 percent; Paine Webber, up 20 percent, and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, 55 percent. The gains, reflecting the booming stock market and speculation that brokers are prime targets in the current wave of financial industry mergers buoyed the share prices of all three firms. At J. P. Morgan, however, earnings fell 44 percent as costs for investment banking outpaced revenue. Still, the earnings surpassed Wall Street expectations. BankAmerica reported a 7 percent gain.
 
THE ECONOMY
A Cooler Spring
Is inflation vanquished or merely hibernating? In any case, consumer prices were unchanged last month, while retail sales unexpectedly fell 0.1 percent. Consumer price growth was held in check by a fourth consecutive monthly drop in energy prices, the Labor Department said, and prices for personal computers and supplies fell 2.8 percent. In another sign of a slightly cooler economy, the Commerce Department said housing starts declined 2.8 percent last month, to 1.59 million units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. That was the first decline since November but still left starts at their second-highest level since January 1989. The nation's trade deficit widened to $12.11 billion in February, the largest since the nation started compiling monthly figures for both goods and services in January 1992.
 
THAILAND
Cauldron of Crisis
Faced with an ultimatum by Thailand's central bank to raise fresh capital, the Wanglee family dynasty is reluctantly preparing for a distress sale of a controlling stake in Nakornthon Bank, the family's crown jewel. Vorawee Wanglee, above, is chief executive. The collapse of Asian financial markets has struck a blow -- a fatal one, some economists say -- at perhaps the most outstanding feature of Thai business: the domination by a few wealthy Chinese families. "Our ancestors could never have imagined that it would come to this," said Thamnu Wanglee, the bank's president. "But they also could never have imagined such a crisis."
 
CYBERCAFES
No Place Like Home
In the mid-1990's, cybercafes were a now idea, serving light food, coffee and computer access for customers willing to pay $7 to $14 an hour to surf the net or check their E-mail. But in city after city, cybercafes have quietly closed or turned into something else -- a victim of their own strength. People who sampled the World Wide Web con leche began buying their own computers and speedy home connections. Now, many, like the Internet Cafe, below, in New York's East Village, have idle terminals.

HEADLINE: How to Stay a Titan

BYLINE: By Ron Chernow; Ron Chernow is the author of a forthcoming biography, "Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr."

 BODY:
On May 15, 1911, in a soft voice that belied the supreme drama of the moment, Chief Justice Edward White read aloud a 20,000-word opinion, ordering the breakup of Standard Oil for violating the antitrust laws. Thus ended a morality play that had riveted America for five years, ever since Teddy Roosevelt's trustbusters decided to teach the trust and its founder, John D. Rockefeller, a lesson in corporate citizenship.
Amid the current wave of corporate mergers, the specter of Standard Oil now hovers over a swelling antitrust debate. On Tuesday, the appeals hearing in the Justice Department's antitrust probe of Microsoft is scheduled to begin. Many critics have noted the often eerie parallels between Rockefeller and Bill Gates. 
 Standard Oil was the most feared and admired monopoly of its day, refining, distributing and marketing nearly 90 percent of America's oil. Microsoft produces 90 percent of the operating systems in new personal computers, prompting similar public ambivalence, for computers are now as indispensable to the economy as oil.
The saga of John D. Rockefeller abounds in cautionary tales for Bill Gates. Like Mr. Gates, Rockefeller earned his fortune in a new industry where the rules of the game had to be improvised. He invested in his first Cleveland refinery in 1863, just four years after oil was discovered in Pennsylvania. In 1870, he established Standard Oil to bring this chaotic industry under his control. While skeptics wondered whether the oil would last, Rockefeller exhibited a fierce, messianic faith in its future. As he coped with a chronic surplus of refining capacity, he lost all trust in competition and began to champion a new economic dispensation: cooperation, his euphemism for monopoly.
In building his empire, Rockefeller patented many tactics that would be outlawed by the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890. He colluded with railroads to win lucrative freight rates, secretly bought out rivals, throttled oil producers by controlling the pipelines, and monopolized oil sales by slashing prices when interlopers appeared. Like Mr. Gates, he adhered to the gospel of high-volume, low-cost production, believing that he had vouchsafed something precious to humanity: cheap illumination by kerosene.
Mr. Gates, of course, is no less evangelical about computers. He stoutly denies that Microsoft is a monopoly because it has lowered prices and improved products. Yet falling prices for personal computers and constant upgrades of Windows technology don't really acquit him of being a monopolist; they simply affirm that he is a very smart monopolist. Many people assume that the trust kings of the Gilded Age simply gouged consumers and sold shoddy products. But Rockefeller was an enterprising businessman who boasted that, in its first 20 years, Standard Oil lowered retail kerosene prices to 7.5 cents per gallon from 23.5 cents -- a drop only partly explained by sinking crude oil prices. The trust blanketed oil fields with efficient pipelines and pioneered marketing by tank wagons. It was dreaded more for its low, predatory pricing than for fleecing consumers. Incessant innovation and relatively cheap prices may be necessary conditions for maintaining a monopoly.
Rockefeller never construed his monopoly as an unlimited license to mint money. If he got too greedy, consumers could switch to substitutes -- say, coal instead of fuel oil. Indeed, Edison's light bulb finally doomed the kerosene business that first formed Rockefeller's fortune, though he and Standard Oil were then rescued by the automobile. Rockefeller set prices high enough to guarantee substantial profits but never so high as to lure competitors back into the field. And he refrained from achieving a 100 percent monopoly, later confessing that he allowed a few dozen refiners to eke out a meager existence so he could cite competition in the industry.
The same qualities that make people like Rockefeller and Bill Gates matchless businessmen -- a single-minded intensity, an implacable attitude toward competitors -- prepare them poorly for the delicate art of public relations. Almost from Standard Oil's inception, Rockefeller was hounded by courts and legislators, yet he never conceded any legitimacy to public inquiry. He seldom granted interviews or allowed himself to be photographed. When Ida Tarbell exposed his methods in McClure's Magazine from 1902 to 1905, making him America's most hated mogul, he didn't dignify her serial with a response. By the time Standard Oil hired its first publicist, in 1906, it had already lost the battle for public opinion.
Under fire from the Justice Department, Mr. Gates has awakened belatedly to the need to burnish his image, fielding a small army of aggressive public relations people. He now pops up in golf advertisements and on talk shows. The change in persona, if often cosmetic and unconvincing, at least acknowledges the need for greater accountability and the decisive role of public opinion in antitrust cases.
 A s Rockefeller's story illustrates, antitrust prosecutions tend to be highly political. Major cases are long, expensive and hard to win; trustbusters resort to them as weapons of last resort. Because Standard Oil adopted a strident, antagonistic tone toward investigators, it bore the brunt of Teddy Roosevelt's wrath. Some Standard Oil executives thought that U. S. Steel, International Harvester and other trusts forged by J. P. Morgan escaped prosecution by taking a more conciliatory approach.
In defying the Government's 1995 consent decree that prevented it from "bundling" its Windows operating system with its Internet Explorer browser -- the fear being that Microsoft would unfairly parlay dominance in desktop computers into Internet control -- Microsoft gambled on a hard-line approach. Yet, in refusing to make concessions, it has only invited wider scrutiny -- as the Standard Oil precedent would have predicted.
If Microsoft seems an all-powerful colossus, it is actually far more vulnerable than Standard Oil. The oil trust was 20 times the size of its nearest competitor, the puny Pure Oil. Except for production, where its market share never exceeded 35 percent, Standard Oil owned the entire industry. The antitrust crusade against it was spearheaded by a ragtag band of maverick refiners, muckraking journalists and reform-minded attorneys general, supported by small oil producers from new fields in Texas, California and Kansas.
By contrast, Microsoft faces a phalanx of formidable competitors, including Netscape, Oracle, I.B.M. and Sun Microsystems. These powerful companies deploy hordes of lawyers, publicists and politicians to keep Microsoft on the defensive.
Even so, Mr. Gates remains popular, even heroic, among many Americans. The move to block him will succeed only if his competitors can convince the public that they aren't trying to win in the political arena what they have failed to achieve in the marketplace. So far, there are only glimmers of a mass popular revolt against Mr. Gates of the sort that Ida Tarbell and Teddy Roosevelt managed to engineer against Rockefeller.
If Standard Oil's fate argues for Microsoft to take a more cooperative approach, it also suggests that the Justice Department should avoid broad antitrust action against the company. Standard Oil presided over a comparatively static industry, with big technological shifts -- like the advent of long-distance pipelines or oil tankers -- occurring only two or three times a decade. The core products remained remarkably unchanged.
By contrast, the computer industry thrives on perpetual revolutions in the design, power and even purposes of its products. New technologies, like network computers or the Java programming language, have the potential to reshape the industry and subvert Microsoft's domination. The panicky, almost paranoid reaction of Bill Gates to his competitors is perhaps the strongest testimony to his underlying anxiety about his monopoly -- an anxiety that seldom ruffled the sleep of John D. Rockefeller.
The Justice Department should insure that Mr. Gates doesn't abuse his operating system monopoly as he expands into new areas. At the same time, it should recognize that he can never rule his industry as absolutely as Rockefeller did the oil business. There's no need to re-enact the agony of the Standard Oil breakup.

HEADLINE: Talks Indicate Japan's Links With Russians Are Improving

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 18

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto began a two-day meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today in an effort to improve economic cooperation and work toward a peace treaty that would finally mark an end to territorial disputes dating from World War II.
Both men appeared vigorous and cheerful as they greeted each other with an embrace in the resort town of Kawana, 80 miles southwest of Tokyo. 
 The meeting is not expected to achieve a breakthrough, but it still marks a steady improvement in Russian-Japanese relations.
Antagonism between the two countries has been a central feature of the Asian political landscape for decades; they never signed a peace treaty after World War II. Japan resisted economic cooperation with Russia in large part because it insisted on first recovering a group of islands that Russia seized in the closing days of the war.
Over the last few years, however, Japan has switched tactics. It still wants the return of the islands -- which Japan calls its Northern Territories and Russia says are part of the Kurile Island chain. But Tokyo now seems prepared to discuss other issues and improve ties in the hope that this will eventually lead to return of the islands.
"I'm looking forward to having frank talks with Ryu," Mr. Yeltsin said, using a nickname for the Japanese Prime Minister. The two leaders disclosed little about their conversation today, but they are to hold a news conference on Sunday after their meetings.
Mr. Hashimoto's strategy has been to try to build trust and a personal relationship with Mr. Yeltsin. To that end he organized what he called a "no necktie" summit meeting in a resort villa. In Japan, it is often said that officials find it easier to speak directly and get to the bottom of a problem when they are meeting informally and have shed their neckties -- or easiest of all when they have shed everything and are drinking sake while bathing together nude.
This meeting will not go that far, however, and in any case it is unclear whether the informality will make much difference for Mr. Yeltsin, who is impetuous and brash and thus everything that Mr. Hashimoto is not.
The main point of the meeting will be to further develop the plan outlined at a similar meeting in Russia last November to achieve a peace treaty by 2000.
As part of the economic cooperation measures envisioned in that plan, Mr. Hashimoto is expected to announce that he will make it easier to provide Japanese trade insurance for transactions with Russia. That step might in turn lead to more Japanese investment in Russia.
The two countries will also discuss cooperation in combating global warming, and in organizing disaster drills in the Sea of Japan between their naval forces. They may also call for a regular security dialogue in Asia involving Japan, Russia, China and the United States.
If the two nations can sign a peace treaty and improve relations, then there is potential for a mutually beneficial economic partnership. Russia has vast quantities of untapped natural resources in its far East, areas closer to Tokyo than to Moscow. And Japan has the technology and capital to exploit those resources, as well as the need for them to power its industry.
Trade and investment between the two are already increasing, though slowly. And a fishing agreement signed in February may resolve disputes that in the past have frequently led Russian patrol vessels to seize Japanese fishing boats. In a sign of improved relations last year, a Russian destroyer made a courtesy call on a Japanese port for the first time in 103 years.
After meeting today in Kawana and walking together with arms around each other, Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Hashimoto burst into a wedding being held at the resort and offered their congratulations. Mr. Yeltsin kissed the stunned bride on both cheeks.
"I hope you have many children," Mr. Yeltsin told her. "I would like to convey the best wishes of the entire Russian people to you."
Mr. Hashimoto is planning to visit Russia for further talks this fall, and Mr. Yeltsin is expected to return to Japan again next year.

HEADLINE: Where Opium Reigned, Burmese Claim Inroads

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: LASHIO, Myanmar

 BODY:
In the remote valleys and rugged mountains here in northeastern Myanmar, opium offers more than a narcotic high. For years, it has provided a livelihood for hill tribes who inhabit the northern expanse of the Golden Triangle, the lush, lawless area of Southeast Asia that is the source of much of the world's heroin.
Opium finances daily needs, from rice and cooking oil to assault rifles. The rifles are used to wage rebellion and to defend the mule caravans transporting the sticky, pungent opium to be refined into heroin for American and European drug habits. 
 Myanmar, formerly Burma, produced an estimated 2,600 tons of opium last year, enough to make more than 200 tons of heroin -- at least 60 percent of the world total. But the drug trade is changing along Myanmar's porous frontiers with Thailand, China and Laos, and one of the most startling shifts may be in the attitude of the military junta that seized power in this country in 1988.
For years the junta tolerated opium trafficking as the price of its cease-fires with insurgent ethnic groups. Now it says that it wants to eradicate all opium within five years. To show what it has accomplished, it recently allowed three American reporters into an opium-growing region usually closed to visitors.
Some diplomats in Yangon, the capital, view the eradication claim skeptically because land devoted to opium cultivation has doubled under the junta's rule and the country's mismanaged economy has grown to rely on laundered drug profits.
The Government says it has eradicated 41,000 acres of poppies, one-tenth of the land under opium cultivation in Myanmar. "The crop eradication areas are only small parts of the areas they do control," a Western diplomat said. 'They are window dressing."
Col. Gyaw Thien, the chief of Myanmar's counternarcotics program, disagreed, declaring that the Government was being asked to solve a century-old problem in two weeks without any help. "It's quite unfair," he said. "We are making much more effective interdictions and seizures than we have in the past."
Last year, police and army units reported seizing 1.5 tons of heroin, compared with about half a ton in 1996, though their record seizures amount to less than 1 percent of Myanmar's output. "This drug problem is not only the problem of the United States," Colonel Gyaw Thien said. "It's our problem too. We know that we cannot fight this alone."
The junta's new policy puts Washington in a quandary because the United States cut off counternarcotics aid to Burma after the coup in 1988. Restoring such aid could undercut other American economic sanctions and lend legitimacy to a dictatorship that stands accused of widespread abuse of human rights.
"We think we can get rid of 60 percent of the heroin going into the U.S. in 12 months' time if the U.S. cooperates with us," said Lieut. Col. Hla Min, the deputy director of the Office of Strategic Studies, a planning branch of military intelligence.
A Western diplomat who watched the shift concluded: "What this Government wants to do is perpetuate itself in power. They know it's got a bad image. They looked at drugs and found this is the one asset they have. They'd like to use whatever they've done to improve their image and try to get sanctions lifted."
The State Department acknowledges in its latest drug control report that it has no evidence that Myanmar's Government is trafficking in drugs on an institutional level.
"However," the report said, "there are persistent and reliable reports that officials, particularly army personnel posted in outlying areas, are involved in the drug business."
The Government denies this, citing the arrest of 11 army officers last April for colluding with a heroin refining operation in northern Shan state. The senior officer, a lieutenant colonel, was sent to prison for 25 years. It also deported Li Yunchun, a fugitive trafficker indicted in New York, to Thailand, which handed him over to the United States.
But new traffickers, notably the Wa, a fierce hill people whose ancestors hunted heads, have wrested control of the lucrative heroin business from remnants of renegade Chinese Nationalist soldiers and rebel militias.
Nearly a million Wa straddle the border between China and Myanmar. Their insurgent army has diversified from heroin into methamphetamines, powerful synthetic stimulants that have saturated Thailand and since turned up in Japan, Taiwan and Malaysia, Burmese and Western officials say. A Burmese counter-narcotics official said the Wa now make more money from methamphetamines than from heroin and refine both drugs themselves using chemicals smuggled in primarily from China.
Because of aggressive action by the Thai police, the old trafficking routes through the Golden Triangle are shifting from Thailand into China, or less often Laos and even northeastern India. Some heroin still moves by truck down from the Shan highlands market town of Lashio, through lowland Mandalay to the port of Yangon, as Rangoon is now called.
Eradicating opium could help the military Government's strategy of subduing ethnic insurgents who traffic in opium to finance their wars of independence. Government troops cannot enter most Wa-controlled territory without a battle.
With an army estimated at 15,000 to 20,000 men, the Wa have grown so strong, acquiring surface-to-air missiles and modern communications equipment, that Government troops complain about feeling outgunned. Last summer, a 30-man Government patrol was wiped out when it ran into a Wa mule caravan smuggling methamphetamine to Thailand.
"The Burmese would like nothing better than to do away with the drug trade," another diplomat in Yangon said, "because it would take guns out of the hands of these armies."
The Government's creation of a handful of opium-free zones has upset local farmers. "What we're talking about is really changing their life style," said Jorgen Kristensen, an official with the United Nations Drug Control Program, which has introduced alternative development projects. "Poppy cultivation is ingrained in their culture."
At Nam Tit, a Wa town about a half-hour's walk from the Chinese border, Zi Zi Fa, a farmer in patched shirt and shorts, said his grandfather and father grew opium poppies. He earned about $650 for his own annual crop of 12 1/2 pounds of opium, which he did not need to take to market. "When I was growing poppies," he said, "the buyer came to me."
Since the Government told him to grow soybeans instead, Mr. Zi said, he earns one-tenth of what opium paid, not enough to feed 10 family members.
"The family is barely surviving," he said, echoing a complaint expressed by opium farmers in Afghanistan and coca farmers in Colombia and Peru.
"If we did not grow poppies, our income would not last more than one or two months," he said. 'In the high mountains, rice doesn't grow, and it's too cold. The corn is fit only for the pigs."
In the nearby border town of Chin Shwe Haw, Kyan Ti Jy, a farmer from the ethnic Chinese Kokang minority, said, "We earned more money growing poppies, but our leader said to stop growing opium." Mr. Kyan obediently planted lichee trees and sugar cane. Now, he complained, "nobody's buying sugar because there's no mill." Construction on a sugar refinery is not expected before September.
With their incomes slashed by more than half, "the farmers are not very happy," said a local official, Kyan Tin Wan.
"But the Government is giving out rubber plants and lichee trees almost free of charge, and free fertilizer," he said.
It will take at least three years for the lichee trees to bear fruit. In the meantime, Kyan Tin Wan said, "large families who cannot stand it are going out of designated opium-free areas to where the Government cannot touch them."
The official conceded that even farmers who gave up opium as a crop "still might be growing a little bit here and there for medicinal purposes."
At his base in Lauk Kai, the Kokang political leader, Peng Jiasheng, said it was hard for his people to stop growing opium.
"We admit there is poppy growing in this area to a certain extent, but not the way we've been portrayed," he said. "It's not that the leaders are buying opium and taking it down to the Golden Triangle. We're not involved in that."
Before the Kokang concluded a cease-fire with the Burmese Government in 1989, Mr. Peng trafficked in opium himself.
"When we were insurgents, we needed to expand our army and we needed weapons and food," he said. "For that we needed to grow more poppies."
His troops did not cultivate opium, Mr. Peng said, but levied a 40 percent tax on what local farmers produced. "Seventy percent of the people in this area were supporting us financially for the insurgency," he explained. "But now there's no more fighting and our troops are drastically reduced." At the height of the rebellion, he said, the Kokang and Wa could field 60,000 soldiers between them. Now, he insisted, his troops have dwindled to 500.
"Today it's peaceful, so we don't need to grow poppies," the Kokang leader said, waving a hand adorned with a heavy gold bracelet and gold rings. "If my people can have their stomachs full and something appropriate to wear, they are happy enough. They don't need anything more."
Taking the profit out of opium may be the toughest challenge because when the leader of a drug operation quits, contenders jockey to replace him. For years, Khun Sa and his narco-army dominated the heroin trade under the guise of fighting for Shan self-determination. After some of his troops mutinied, Khun Sa negotiated his surrender in January 1996 and lives comfortably, but in poor health, under Government observation in Yangon.
"We were fighting him for years," Colonel Hla Min of the Office of Strategic Studies said, justifying the Government's accommodation with Khun Sa. "We were not gaining much ground because he was well equipped, well dug-in, and the terrain was terrible. We were sacrificing too many casualties."
"Khun Sa is a walking encyclopedia regarding the drug issue," Colonel Hla Min said. "Everything he knows, we know. But this is a multibillion-dollar business."
The vacuum left by Khun Sa was soon filled by Wei Hsueh-kang, a Wa commander who is said to have 7,000 troops protecting his heroin and methamphetamine operation. "All information is that he's getting larger by the day," said a Western official who follows narcotics matters.
For all the heroin they export to the United States and Europe, such leaders do not tolerate its use in their own ranks. Khun Sa detoxified errant soldiers in cages exposed to the blistering sun or in soggy holes in the ground. While older Kokang people may use opium as medicine, Mr. Peng said, heroin "is not medicine, so there's no excuse."
"Trading in heroin is a serious offense," he said. "We shoot the person."

HEADLINE: Huge Bank Mergers Worry Consumer Groups

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
With the latest wave of bank mergers announced in recent days, most of the public attention was focused on what the mergers would mean to profits, stock prices, executive salaries and corporate synergy. Increasingly, though, citizens' advocates and some lawmakers are questioning what this consolidation in the banking industry will mean to a very basic group: consumers.
Concerned consumer advocates predict that the behemoth mergers of Travelers Group Inc. with Citicorp and of Nationsbank with the BankAmerica Corporation will eventually mean higher costs and fewer services for many customers, especially those with low and moderate incomes. 
 These advocates, who tend to represent consumer groups with a markedly liberal ideology, cite studies indicating that large multistate banks tend to charge higher fees for checking accounts and for the use of automated teller machines. Similarly, these advocates point to studies by the Federal Reserve indicating that when newly merged banks consolidate operations, the branch offices they close tend to be concentrated more heavily in poorer neighborhoods.
"Our general view is straightforward," said Ed Mierzwinski, director of consumer programs for the United States Public Interest Research Group, an advocacy organization. "The bigger banks use monopoly power to charge higher fees. Basically, these mergers create fewer choices for consumers. Fewer choices mean less competition and more monopoly consolidation of power."
But some economists describe these consumer advocates as victims of an outmoded ideology that glorifies a past banking environment in which financial institutions routinely red-lined poor neighborhoods, and consumers had an extremely difficult time getting cash during hours when their neighborhood bank was closed.
"I think they're missing the boat," said Randall Kroszner, an associate professor of economics at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business, who specializes in banking issues. "I think they're focusing on the wrong issues. They're concerned about change. But you have to look at where we're starting from. We are starting from an environment that has been extremely anti-consumer."
The number of banks and savings and loan institutions has declined as a result of deregulation, acquisitions and failures, to 10,922 in 1997 from 18,193 in 1981. But at the same time, the number of bank branches has remained relatively stable, around 83,000, meaning consolidation has not had an adverse effect on convenience.
Moreover, some economists argue that the merger frenzy has been taking place at the top of the banking food chain, not at the level of neighborhood banks. A study published last year by John Boyd, professor of finance at the University of Minnesota, indicated that 85 percent of those banks that were taken over had assets of more than $100 million. In Mr. Carlson's view, competition in the banking field still remains because the merger mania so far has not threatened small local banks.
"To a very substantial extent, the consolidation is big banks buying big banks or buying medium-size banks," Mr. Boyd said. "And the small local banks are just sitting there doing what they always do -- making money."
The fear of the consolidation and abuse of banking power, however, is not limited to a few liberal organizations. Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, said this week that their committees would conduct hearings this month on the mergers.
"I'm very concerned about the impact on consumers of all these mergers," said Mr. Specter, a member of the Anti-Trust, Business Rights and Competition subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. "Consumers are going to have fewer banks to go to that are competing for their business."
"Every time you turn around, something is happening," he continued. "We live in a free enterprise economy, laissez-faire. But it's time we stop, look and listen to see if the public interest is being served. We know that the Wall Street interests are being served."
Mr. Leach, who is chairman of House Banking Committee, also promised to look into the issue.
Whether concentration of banking in fewer and fewer hands is good for consumers might depend on which consumers are being considered.
Some liberal consumer advocates note that several studies show that large multistate banks tend to charge higher fees for banking services. In a June 1997 study, the governors of the Federal Reserve Board found that large multistate banks charge, on average, $4 more to stop payment on a check than do small banks that operate in one state. These larger financial institutions also were more likely to charge higher fees for automated teller transactions at other banks.
The Federal Reserve study also showed that on average, the larger banks required a higher minimum balance in checking accounts to avoid a monthly fee, were more likely to provide simple passbook savings accounts and to require a smaller minimum deposit to open one.
But some economists, including Mr. Kroszner, assert that the big financial institutions, with their one-stop shopping appeal, could be more beneficial to affluent consumers, who might buy stocks or mutual funds at their local branch or use one of their teller machines at some far-flung site without having to pay a fee.
"We will probably end up with a two-tiered banking system, the larger banks serving jet-setters and business people," Mr. Kroszner said. "That doesn't mean that the small community bank is going to go away. They provide a different type of service, more personal, more relationship oriented."
The question is whether these full-service banks will still be around in every neighborhood. Another Federal Reserve study, this one published in September, showed that despite little change in the overall number of bank branches, the number of branches in inner-city neighborhoods declined 21 percent from 1975 to 1995.
"This is the most obvious area of impact," said John E. Taylor, president of National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a trade association of groups seeking more investment in inner-city areas. "Where there are overlapping branches as a result of a merger, somebody is going to close branches. Disproportionately, these branch closings occur in minority and poor neighborhoods."
The Federal Reserve study indicated that it was difficult to determine whether the branch closings in poor inner-city areas were the result of acquisitions or of population loss in these neighborhoods.
"In 1975, low-income neighborhoods had the largest number of offices per capita," the study said. "By 1995, there was relatively little change."

HEADLINE: Deaths of Sea Turtles Create Split on Causes

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Tex.

 BODY:
Straight up the coast from here, a 100-pound loggerhead turtle named Bill -- with no front flippers -- lives in a water tank at a marine science institute, the apparent victim of someone with a big knife.
At Padre Island National Seashore, Donna Shaver, who has fought for the last 18 years to save sea turtles, points out a steel table where a sea turtle awaits a necropsy to determine a cause of death. Then she heads to a pit that holds 10 dead turtles -- 4 of them Kemp's ridleys, which are believed to be the world's most endangered turtles and one of the most endangered species. 
 "It's very frustrating and it's very depressing," said Ms. Shaver, who is a research biologist for the United States Geological Survey on Padre Island and the Texas coordinator for the Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network.
Conservationists say the turtles die when they get trapped in the nets of shrimp boats and drown. The large number of deaths, along with with mutilations that conservationists suspect are intentional, have led three groups to demand that the waters off this national seashore be permanently closed to shrimpers.
The groups, Earth Island Institute's Sea Turtle Restoration Project, the Humane Society of the United States and Help Endangered Animals-Ridley Turtles want 65 miles of coastline designated as a marine sanctuary.
But the shrimping industry says that any number of causes, including pollution, are causing the deaths and that more turtles are dying because there are simply more of them out there. Putting the area off limits to shrimpers would cause more than $150 million in economic loss to an industry that employs 15,000 people in the state, said Wilma Anderson, the executive director of the Texas Shrimp Association. It would also endanger the existence of the fishing ports of Brownsville and Port Isabel, among the nation's most lucrative, she said.
David Wellesley, a 47-year-old shrimper, said he doubted that shrimpers were responsible for all the dead turtles.
"There ain't no shrimper on this coast that will tell you he wants to catch a turtle," said Mr. Wellesley, who works on the 75-foot Uncle Buddy, docked in Aransas Pass. "I watch a lot of PBS and Discovery Channel. I've got nothing against the turtle."
But Ms. Shaver said the turtle deaths were clearly related to shrimping. They drop 90 percent in the two months each summer when Texas bans offshore shrimpers to let shrimps grow, she said.
In March, 54 sea turtles were found dead, 18 of them ridleys. In March 1997, 11 were found, 3 of them ridleys. Last year, 459 turtles, including loggerheads, greens, leatherbacks, hawksbills and Kemp's ridleys, were stranded on the same coastline, Ms. Shaver said, and 173 were ridleys.
The worldwide population of adult ridleys is estimated at 3,000, up from fewer than 2,000 in the 1980's.
The deaths of ridley turtles come in the midst of a 20-year effort to coax the olive-colored turtles to nest at Padre. The ridleys, which can grow to 100 pounds and more than two-feet in length, are the smallest of the sea turtles. They had nested almost exclusively in Mexico, but from 1978 to 1988 more than 22,000 eggs were shipped here in a project between the two countries. The project was intended to create a backup nesting site in the United States.
Since the early 1990's, Federal law has required American shrimpers to sew metal or plastic grates into their nets to shunt the sea turtles out through a nearby flap. Known as turtle-excluder devices, or T.E.D.'s, such shields are supposed to free 97 percent of captured turtles.
"The Coast Guard says we're 95 to 98 percent in compliance," said W. K. Zimmerman, who owns Nautical Marine, a Port Isabel company with 10 shrimp boats. "But the first time they find one dead turtle on the beach, we're all bad boys and we're not using our T.E.D.'s."
Closing the coastline may be an option. But studies by the National Marine Fisheries Service, an agency of the Commerce Department that is responsible for protecting the turtles, show that such action would not be effective, said Colleen Coogan, a biologist for the agency's southeastern region.
Stricter enforcement by the United States Coast Guard to catch those few who do not use the excluder devices should protect the turtles as well as closing the coastline would, Ms. Coogan said.
Meanwhile, Tony Amos, the University of Texas researcher who saved Bill, the mutilated turtle, is trying to find him a home at an aquarium, so far without luck.
"They like to have a complete animal to put on display," Mr. Amos said.

HEADLINE: THE BOATING REPORT;
EF Language Tames the Seas, and Rivals

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD 

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., April 18

 BODY:
Mark Rudiger's voice resonated from the deck intercom on EF Language, the leading 64-foot sailboat here on its stopover in the Whitbread Round the World Race.
"Now hear this, now hear this," the voice said. "Drinks will be served on the Lido deck." 
 Wry laughter filled the cockpit. They were no tourists, and their yacht was no Love Boat, and liquor is not allowed on board. But the lighthearted moment Wednesday captured the essence of what the crew had accomplished the last eight months. It had turned a grueling trip across unknown waters into an unexpected coup.
Team EF Language had begun the race as a crew with a reputation for being expert round-the-buoy sailors but relative neophytes in the rigors of a 31,600-nautical-mile marathon around the world. And the 1997-98 competition has been as tough as it gets in yachting. America's Cup sailors flooded to the event, and old Whitbread stalwarts such as Grant Dalton and Lawrie Smith were back.
But EF Language has not only stood up, but also claimed significant victories. It has won three of six Whitbread stages so far and finished second, fourth and fifth in the other three. With 608 points over all, the EF boat, with Paul Cayard of San Francisco as its skipper and team mentor, has 115 points more than its second-place opponent, Swedish Match. With three legs left, it is in an enviable position in the nine-boat international competition.
In fact, so strong is EF Language's potential grip on the Whitbread trophy that some aficionados actually fell for an April Fool's Day news story announcing that the boat would skip the seventh leg from here to Baltimore so as to hone itself for the final two legs.
EF Language is in a comfortable niche, and here in sunny Florida, it has been tough to keep the smiles under control. Autograph seekers are at every corner, and the circus atmosphere of the Whitbread base here, complete with tents, eateries and souvenirs, makes the hardships at sea seem remote.
But as always, Cayard takes nothing for granted.
"It seems like a great spot to be in," Cayard said Thursday. "But it's not without pressure. I still have high expectations for my team. I am still looking at the big picture, and I don't want to break anything on the boat in the next few legs. Even if it's my own sense of pride, I don't want to be dribbling into the finish line."
The crew has not let up under his tutelage. With the seventh stage scheduled to start Sunday and Baltimore a mere 870 nautical miles north, the team went sailing Wednesday to calibrate its electronic instruments and check the boat's newly installed mast. On Friday, they set out to sea again, this time to re-create the start itself.
This focus has characterized EF's crew throughout the journey. In February, when the boat rounded Cape Horn, the legendary tip of South America, the team did not break open the sailor's traditional bottle of Champagne. "We had freeze-dried apple pudding to celebrate," said Rudiger, who is the boat's navigator. "It looked like purple mush."
If any member of the crew has the right to complain about small matters -- albeit in jest -- it is Rudiger. Rudi, as his teammates call him, spends about 80 percent of his time below deck in a cramped space about the size of a home freezer.
It has a double seat, not unlike the front of the little bumper cars people ride in amusement parks. Cayard, like Rudiger more than 6 feet 2 inches tall, often crams in beside him. With the 40-foot seas and boat-bashing that goes on in a Whitbread race, even a machine shop sounds quieter than their racing cubbyhole. There they pore over the steady flow of weather faxes and computer data that streams in day and night.
Smith credits EF's navigational decisions for its commanding lead. "They haven't had any bad luck," he said, "and their navigation has been excellent. They've done well by being in the right place more than anyone else."
It is well-earned, if grudging, praise from the 42-year-old Smith. He had been skipper of EF before the race started, but traded that spot to skipper Silk Cut, a British entry. "Obviously, I gave away a very good campaign," he said. It did not help that Silk Cut was dismasted on its way to Cape Horn, a breakdown that cost Smith any chance of winning.
There is no love lost between the two teams, and a standoff subsequently developed over their masts. Both EF Language and Silk Cut had identical spars, and Team EF asked Smith in Sao Sebastiao, Brazil, the last stopover, to share information about what had failed on Silk Cut's mast. Smith refused; if EF was worried about its mast falling down, he said, the team could choose not to sail. Ultimately, he suggested that EF pay him for the information.
"I wanted to make sure that if someone dies because EF's mast falls down, I could say that I offered them the technology but they refused to pay for it," Smith said succinctly.
Johan Salen, EF's president, insisted that the information was a matter of concern for the good of the competition. "This sport cannot survive if you cannot help each other in safety-related issues," Salen said.
The EF team installed a new mast here after convincing race officials that the mast it already had needed to be replaced because it showed structural fatigue. EF team members are treating Smith's lack of cooperation as fallout from EF's being in the lead; Silk Cut is sixth.
The EF Language team has its own views of its success. "I think preparation is a big factor for us," Rudiger said. "This team got an early start, our sail development is top notch, and it's turned out to be real important that we have boat speed."
Salen added, "Winners are those who manage their problems in the best way."
EF has spared no detail or expense to do that. The syndicate fields two boats with an unprecedented $20 million budget. The budgets of most of its eight rivals are half of Team EF's. EF Education, the race sponsor, is a multinational Swedish educational services company. It has 54 people on its Whitbread payroll; 38 other sponsors and suppliers assist in the effort.
EF Language is winning, earning the approval of the sponsors. But the group's second yacht, EF Education, has not done nearly so well. The all-female crew is in last place with 148 points. It has been the victim of gear failures and generally a poor showing that can be attributed in large part to the women's relative lack of ocean experience.
Having two teams, each with a similar new boat built in Sweden, has allowed Team EF the luxury of economies of scale. With twice as many shore crew members than other Whitbread crews, EF can focus on whichever yacht needs more help.
Richard Brisius, a Swede who is shore manager, oversees a slick and efficient Whitbread campaign. At any time, he has two 40-foot containers filled with gear and supplies traveling by ship to the next Whitbread port. Here in Fort Lauderdale, two other containers are in constant use. One serves as a storage container, the other as a maintenance shop.
"Our idea has been to create a setup ashore where people find everything they're used to having," Brisius said. "Once ashore, they can quickly get into a work mode, get everything fixed on the boat, and then have quality time off."
Brisius ships three skateboards from place to place. And he understands the need for in-line skates, bicycles and even a kayak. But he drew the line the day crew members looked admiringly at four-foot wood-carved giraffes in South Africa. "I told everyone, 'No giraffes,' " he said. " 'No giraffes.' But I think someone hid a wood rhino."

HEADLINE: Mayor Prices New Name

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
Eager to play down the possible $1 billion cost for a new Yankee Stadium, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is reiterating the idea of naming a new stadium for a corporation that would help pick up the tab.
While such a deal might upset many fans, it holds great appeal for a Mayor trying to minimize the political and economic cost of moving the Yankees out of the Bronx, probably to the West Side of Manhattan. 
 "Naming rights of baseball parks have gone as high as $100 million, and it's estimated that naming rights for a Shea or Yankee stadium would exceed that amount by a considerable amount," the Mayor said Friday on his radio call-in program on WABC-AM. After citing other possible sources of private funds, including permanent advertising rights, he added, "All of those things are things that need to be negotiated."
The possibility of such a sale surfaced two years ago, when a report commissioned by the city and state estimated that the naming rights for a new stadium for the Yankees could be worth $1.5 million a year. At the time, the Mayor joked that the name of the new stadium "depends on the amount of money" that is offered.
Since then, he has raised the idea several times. But he is pushing it afresh after the collapse on Monday of a 500-pound steel joint at Yankee Stadium, which forced the postponement of two games and emboldened proponents of a new field.
The city's inspectors found no structural problems with the stadium. For the Mayor, though, it was a chance to promote a new stadium, which would include the lucrative skyboxes that the 75-year-old Yankee Stadium lacks. Donning a Yankees cap and jacket when cameras were around, he spent much of the week promoting replacements for Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium.
Although the estimated cost of $1 billion for a new home for the Yankees came from a report commissioned in part by the city, the Mayor dismissed it throughout the week as the unsubstantiated exaggeration of opponents.
On his radio program, he said he would use the coming days to educate New Yorkers about the costs and benefits of retaining both baseball teams by "explaining how it can be done, without nearly the difficulties that many who just oppose any kind of development, or any change, really, will suggest."

HEADLINE: In Easy Year for Incumbents, Republican Breaks the Norm

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: JENKINTOWN, Pa., April 17

 BODY:
In an election year when voter contentment and a humming economy seem likely to keep most members of Congress in office, Representative Jon D. Fox diverges from the norm.
Mr. Fox, a Republican who was first elected to Congress in 1994 from the affluent suburbs west of Philadelphia, is perceived as one of the most vulnerable incumbents in what is widely described as a low-stress year for those already in office. 
 Mr. Fox, who has never won more than 49 percent of the vote, is being challenged by three members of his own party in next month's primary. If he wins, his opponent in November is the same Democrat who lost to him by just 84 votes two years ago. And Mr. Fox is on a select list of sitting Republicans whom Democrats hope to oust in their long-shot quest to retake control of the House.
"His fellow Republicans smell blood in the water and are going after him," said Olivia Morgan, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Two of his Republican challengers have more cash than Mr. Fox has, according to the Federal Election Commission. And three have started broadcasting television ads.
"Unless you are up on TV, you won't be able to take out an incumbent," said Jonathan Newman, a lawyer who has so far emerged as Mr. Fox's most aggressive challenger.
Mr. Newman has lent himself $575,000, and has half a million dollars left. Melissa Brown, an opthalmologist who has appealed to doctors across the country for contributions, has $367,000 on hand. Mr. Fox has $193,000 in his campaign treasury. Michael McMonagle, a longtime abortion opponent, has about $37,000.
The big spending promises to make this the most expensive Congressional race ever in this district, which lies largely in Montgomery County and encompasses some of the wealthy Main Line suburbs.
In 1992, voters elected a Democrat, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, for the first time since World War I -- only to throw her out in 1994 because she cast the deciding vote for President Clinton's tax-raising budget.
While the district remains heavily Republican, its relatively liberal leanings -- in favor of abortion rights and gun control -- have opened it increasingly to Democratic candidates who can appeal to its many homemakers. President Clinton won here in both of his elections.
But with both parties finding success in the ideological middle, there have been few disputes in the runup to the May 19 primary. Mr. Fox, Mr. Newman and Ms. Brown all favor abortion rights. They loathe the Internal Revenue Service.
Mr. Fox seems to be following the strategy of the Republican Congressional leaders, which is to lay low and not provoke old antagonisms toward the party's "revolutionary" class of 1994. At a breakfast here for local business men and women, Mr. Fox said he was most proud of having secured millions of dollars in the recent highway bill for local road projects and of providing constituent services.
The primary has focused on such nebulous verities as whether Mr. Fox is a career politician who has been bought by special interests, as Mr. Newman asserts, or whether Mr. Newman is a dilettante (he breeds race horses) trying to buy his way into office, as Mr. Fox asserts. Mr. Fox argues that experience counts; Mr. Newman promises to put a smarter face on the district in Congress.
Terry Madonna, a political analyst at Millersville University, said that because Republicans had opted for a nonconfrontational, don't-rock-the-boat style, the primary hinged more on personalities than issues.
"There are still big divisions in the Republican caucus in Washington," Mr. Madonna said, "but what the public is seeing is a milder, softer Republican Party, and that makes it more difficult to define the mushy middle." So mild has the Republican revolution become that Mr. Fox will be the host of Speaker Newt Gingrich, once portrayed by Democrats as the face of extremism, at a Monday fund-raiser.
Mr. Newman, 36, expressed a fervor closer in spirit to the young House conservatives. But he said at one point that they had "too hard an edge that turns people off."
Mr. Madonna said Mr. Newman had run "the most inept campaign I've ever seen." The challenger is on his third set of campaign workers. And three local chapters of the N.A.A.C.P. plan to meet on Monday night to discuss the racial implications of some of Mr. Newman's statements and a possible racial slur by a former campaign manager. Mr. Newman opposes affirmative action. He opposed the nomination of a local black judge to a Federal judgeship, saying she was soft on crime.
Mr. Madonna said Mr. Fox could benefit by having so many challengers in the primary, because they could split the anti-Fox vote.
"But make no mistake -- this guy is always one furlong away from disaster," Mr. Madonna said. "He's not aggressive. There's no focus to him. He has never been able to establish a firm base in the district."

HEADLINE: Terry Sanford, Pace-Setting Governor in 60's, Dies at 80

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
Terry Sanford, who lowered racial barriers as Governor of North Carolina in the 1960's, setting the style for a new kind of Southern politician, and later became a United States Senator and Presidential candidate, died today at his home in Durham, N.C. He was 80.
The cause was complications from cancer, said Duke University, where Mr. Sanford was treated and where he was president from 1969 to 1985. 
 Until his cancer was diagnosed in December, Mr. Sanford had taught government and public policy at Duke and practiced law. He was president of the university, in Durham, after serving as Governor and before his term in the Senate. Mr. Sanford was at various times a lawyer, a member of the North Carolina State Senate, from 1953 to 1955, and, in the early 1940's, an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Mr. Sanford was Governor from 1961 to 1965, a time when civil rights demonstrations were frequently met with violence. In a speech on Jan. 18, 1963, he called for an end to job discrimination against blacks and announced the creation of a biracial panel, the North Carolina Good Neighbor Council, to work toward that end.
"Despite great progress, the Negro's opportunity to obtain a good job has not been achieved in most places across the country," Mr. Sanford said. Opening more opportunities would be good for the state's economy, he said, but there was a far more compelling reason. "We will do it because it is honest and fair for us to give all men and women their best chance in life," he said.
By today's standards, those words seem unremarkable. But in January 1963, when Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama delivered his "segregation forever" inaugural address, Mr. Sanford's stand for civil rights was seen as particularly courageous for a governor from the old Confederacy.
Mr. Sanford established himself as one of the most liberal Southern governors -- too liberal, in the eyes of some constituents -- as he named black people to high state positions, pushed state lawmakers to raise more money for schools and started a state anti-poverty program that was a forerunner to President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty.
In some ways, Mr. Sanford was a contradictory politician. He seemed to have good timing but bad luck. He had shrewd instincts, yet he seemed to lack burning desire. His changes of mind and heart confounded ally and rival alike.
Mr. Sanford was an early supporter of John F. Kennedy's quest for the Presidency, and so enjoyed easy access to the White House in the early 1960's. The President's personal secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, later wrote in a book that President Kennedy had told her he was thinking of Mr. Sanford as his running mate for 1964.
His own liberal programs notwithstanding, Mr. Sanford preached the virtues of "state responsibility," if not states' rights, as an antidote to creeping "big Federal Government." Under state law, Mr. Sanford could not succeed himself as Governor.
He tried for the White House in 1972 and in 1976, while he was president of Duke University, offering himself as a candidate for those disenchanted with the political system and those who were part of it.
Mr. Sanford, who had declared his support for school integration, was beaten in the 1972 North Carolina Democratic Primary by Governor Wallace of Alabama. That humiliating loss in his home state effectively ended his candidacy.
Four years later, Mr. Sanford ran for President again but dropped out early. He said he had found it impossible to gain enough news coverage and to raise enough money, and that he was sick of campaigning.
In 1986, having left Duke, Mr. Sanford ran for the Senate. When President Ronald Reagan made several appearances on behalf of his opponent, Mr. Sanford knew better than to criticize a President. So he suggested instead that North Carolina did not need a "go-along Senator." Mr. Sanford won a narrow victory.
In the Senate, Mr. Sanford gained a reputation for intelligence, personal decency and, in one celebrated instance, indecision. In 1987, after President Reagan had vetoed an $87.9 billion highway bill, Mr. Sanford changed his mind three times: first voting simply "present" on a vote to override the veto, then voting to sustain the veto and finally, under tremendous pressure from other Democrats, switching again and voting to override it. His vote made the count 67 to 33, the precise margin required to override.
"Nobody in the Senate thinks I caved in," he said later.
In fact, his colleagues on both sides of the aisle were saddened at seeing him buckle.
"He's a gentleman," said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York. "Maybe that's his problem. He's such a beautiful man."
In 1992, Mr. Sanford appeared at first to be in good position for re-election, but he was hospitalized with a heart problem during the campaign. His opponent, Lauch Faircloth, a former Democrat and onetime friend, tried to tar him with the brush of liberalism. And Mr. Faircloth deftly made an issue of Mr. Sanford's health by publicly wishing him a speedy recovery.
Mr. Faircloth's narrow victory ended Mr. Sanford's political life, one that had begun when he was 11: in a 1928 parade in his hometown, Laurinburg, N.C., Terry Sanford carried a sign for Alfred E. Smith, the Democratic Presidential candidate.
Terry Sanford was born on Aug. 20, 1917. His father was a merchant and his mother a schoolteacher.
He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1939. After a brief stint in the F.B.I., he joined the Army in 1942. That year, he married Margaret Knight of Hopkinsville, Ky.
Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Terry Jr., of Durham; a daughter, Elizabeth, of Hillsborough; two sisters, Mary Glenn Rose of Pennsylvania, and Helen Wilhelm of Bern, Switzerland, and two grandchildren.
As an Army private, Mr. Sanford served as a paratrooper, taking part in the invasion of Southern France and later in the Battle of the Bulge, for which he received the Bronze Star and a Purple Heart.
After the war, mustering out as a first lieutenant, he received his law degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and became active in the North Carolina Democratic Party.
Whether working for himself or on behalf of other Democrats, he was known as a tireless campaigner, and a cool one. While he was running for governor, the pilot of his small plane seriously misjudged a short landing strip and came within inches of touching down in a cornfield.
Unruffled, Mr. Sanford stepped out and, grinning, helped several ashen reporters down the steps.
"Start picking corn, boys," he said before walking away.

HEADLINE: Fire Seriously Damages a Harlem Building

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

 BODY:
A building that houses a Harlem sporting goods shop was badly damaged yesterday in a suspicious fire three days after an angry customer warned an employee that the store would be gone soon, the police said.
No one was injured in the fire, which began before 6 A.M. in a three-story building at 317 West 125th Street, when the first-floor sporting goods store and a hair-weaving shop on the second floor were closed. 
 Assistant Chief Kevin Farrell, commander of Manhattan detectives, said that investigators were seeking the customer to question him. "He said something to the effect that the store wouldn't be there for very long and we would like to talk to him to see what he meant," Chief Farrell said.
The man was described as a black man with a large tattoo of an AK-47 assault rifle on his stomach and a pencil thin mustache. He stood 5 feet 8, weighed 180 pounds and wore a green army cap on his bald head, the police said.
The store, Vets Sports Shops, is less than a block from Freddie's Fashion Mart, where eight people were killed in a fierce blaze in 1995 that the police said was deliberately set by a gunman as part of a bitter landlord-tenant dispute. Like the fire at Freddie's, which raised a host of racial and economic questions in Harlem, the confrontation at the sporting goods store carried a racial element.
The customer first walked into Vets Sports Shops on Tuesday afternoon to buy a baseball cap, Chief Farrell said. But after bringing the item to a register and having it rung up, the man became enraged over the amount of tax that was charged, the police said. They added that although he finally bought the cap, the man made "anti-white remarks" to the store owner, Harvey Ludwin, 47, and before leaving, showed the man his distinctive assault-weapon tattoo underlined with what appeared to be an anti-white phrase.
The owner thought little of the altercation until the next day when one of his clerks said the man had returned. According to the police, the man apparently came back to warn the clerk, a black woman, that the store might be gone soon. The store filed a police complaint later that day, Chief Farrell said.
Fire Department officials said smoldering was reported in the building yesterday morning shortly before 6 and fire had damaged much of the first and second floors by the time it was put out an hour later. Fourteen units and 62 firefighters were called to fight the flames, said Firefighter Jack Thompson, a Fire Department spokesman.
According to the police and fire officials, an accelerant either fell or was poured onto the floor in the hair-weaving store and ignited. It then burned through the flooring, whose embers brought the fire to the sporting goods shop below. The third floor, which appears to house a writer's workshop, was not damaged.
Store owners in the neighborhood said threats of arson were common from angry customers these days and that the inferno at Freddie's was often noted in a parting shot.
Freddie's Fashion Mart, which once stood on the corner of 125th Street and Frederick Douglas Boulevard, was burned down by a lone gunman in December 1995. The fire came after a monthlong neighborhood protest over its owner's plans to expand the store, causing the eviction of a black-owned business in the building.
The arsonist, who police said had been one of the protesters, entered the building with a revolver in one hand and a can of flammable liquid in the other. He splashed the liquid over piles of clothing on tables and racks, according to police and witnesses. He also fired at four people who tried to flee, wounding all of them. Although the four shooting victims either pulled themselves to safety or were dragged from the building's entrance by officers, firefighters later found eight bodies in the building, including that of the gunman, who had shot himself.
Police in the 28th Precinct said they had received few reports of arson threats against merchants on Harlem's main thoroughfare, but store owners and workers in the area said such intimidation was common after arguments over prices or the return of merchandise.
Sami Alkhbaz, a 25-year-old owner of a nearby jewelry store, said he was not surprised to hear that such a threat might have finally been carried out on the block.
"I had a woman recently buy a gold bracelet, who after three weeks demanded that I let her return it," he said. "And when I refused, she said, 'See what happened to Freddie's. I'm going to burn you down too.' "
"The police had to take her away," he said. "It happens all the time."

HEADLINE: Latin America Fears Stagnation in Trade Talks With U.S.

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, April 18

 BODY:
President Clinton and 33 other leaders from the Western Hemisphere opened talks here today aimed at making good on their commitment four years ago to create a free-trade zone stretching from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.
But many Latin American governments, disappointed that Mr. Clinton failed to gain so-called fast-track negotiating authority from Congress last year, expressed serious doubts that a hemispheric agreement on trade would ever be signed. 
 "There will be a lot of smiling and back-slapping this weekend," said a Latin American finance minister, who spoke on condition that he remain anonymous, "but the reality is that we are growing frustrated and more and more skeptical that the United States is really committed to free trade."
Trade experts have said that unless Mr. Clinton gets fast-track negotiating authority -- under which Congress can approve or reject trade accords negotiated by the White House, but not amend them -- there is little hope of negotiating a free-trade pact by 2005, a goal set in 1994 at the first Summit of the Americas in Miami.
Facing strong opposition from United States labor unions and members of his own party, Mr. Clinton withdrew fast-track legislation in November after it became clear it would not be enacted.
In a speech at the opening session of the summit meeting today, Mr. Clinton promised to persuade Congress to grant him the authority he wants.
"The United States may not yet have fast-track legislation but we will," he said. "I assure you our commitment to the free-trade areas of the Americas will be in the fast lane of our concerns."
Clinton Administration officials have said that while fast-track authorization will eventually be necessary to conclude a trade accord, the lack of such authority should not preclude the start of formal negotiations here.
Trade officials from Canada, chairman of the hemispheric negotiations, agreed, saying the discussions would proceed despite the lack of fast-track authority.
"Of course it would have been preferable for President Clinton to arrive in Santiago with fast track, but the reality is that much work can and will be done at the front end, without fast-track authority," Canada's International Trade Minister, Sergio Marchi, said in a speech in Toronto this week.
The immediate goal for this weekend, officials said, is to determine the objectives and composition of working commissions that will negotiate various aspects of the agreement and to select the site of a third meeting. Agriculture, services and intellectual property are expected to be among tough negotiating areas.
President Eduardo Frei of Chile, who is host of the summit meeting, said today that he hoped the weekend meetings would give a definitive push toward the creation of "a hemispheric community."
"In a globalized world, the development of our economies is based on the liberalization of trade," Mr. Frei said. "We must continue fighting protectionism. It is necessary that the talk of free trade translate into real works."
Although government and trade officials say otherwise, a major indication that talks have slowed is that leaders will spend considerable time this weekend discussing other issues, like poverty, democracy, freedom of expression, justice, education, human rights and drug trafficking.
In his speech, Mr. Clinton called on Western Hemisphere countries to do more to address the social problems that plague the region.
"Poverty throughout the hemisphere is still too high, income disparity is too great, civil society too fragile, justices system too weak," Mr. Clinton said. "Too many people still lack the education skills necessary to succeed in the new economy."
The President called for the region to undertake a second generation of reforms with priority given to providing children with education.
Administration officials said summit leaders planned to announce a package of more than $6 billion in international support for education. Of that, $3 billion would be in loans from the Inter-American Development Bank and $3 billion would come from the World Bank. Some $130 million will come from the United States Agency for International Development.
As the United States wavers on fast-track authority, Latin American countries are forging trade links among themselves, Canada, Europe and Asia -- alliances that threaten to put American companies at a competitive disadvantage.
South America's largest trading nations -- Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay -- have formed the Mercosur Customs Union, which accounts for two-thirds of the continent's economic activity.
Talks are already under way to merge the Mercosur alliance with the five-nation Andean pact, formed by Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. Together, the two trading groups would form a market of 310 million consumers.
In addition, investment between Latin American countries is rising as more local companies take roles in government privatization throughout the region. It is not uncommon, for example, for Chilean or Argentine companies to hold major stakes in utilities, railroads or pension funds in Brazil, Bolivia or Peru.
Ricardo French-Davis, a United Nations economist in Santiago, said regional groupings were good dress rehearsals for a hemispheric pact.
"It's much easier for the United States to negotiate with a group of countries that has already ironed out its internal problems," he said. "I suggest that everybody take a deep breath and calm down. A hemispheric trade agreement is going to take a while."

U.S. Trade Deficit Hits a 10-Year High

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit rose to $12.1 billion in February, its highest level in a decade, as American exports to Japan plummeted.
The trade figures, released by the Commerce Department, confirmed other evidence of a severe economic downturn in Japan, where consumer spending on both Japanese and foreign goods, ranging from clothes to computers to cars, has slowed dramatically. 
 The figures also seem bound to increase the tension between Washington and Tokyo over Japan's slow reaction to the severity of its economic problems and the pain they can cause in other countries.

HEADLINE: In New Climate, More Politicians Surmount Imperfect Private Lives

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, April 17

 BODY:
Standing before a battery of television cameras on Thursday afternoon, Michael J. Bowers lightly touched his wife, Bette Rose, on her shoulder as they fielded questions about the most intimate details of their marriage -- and tried to salvage his campaign for governor after fresh disclosures about his 15-year affair with a former aide.
"We were blessed by almighty God, who reached out and said, 'I'm going to let you guys fall in love again,' " Mr. Bowers said. "And it is a very real thing. It is the most important thing in our lives today. And no matter what happens about this, this election, this primary, this whole political process, she and I will be together, we will be in love." 
 It is a testament to an environment in which voters appear less judgmental and more forgiving of the private lapses of their public servants that Mr. Bowers's campaign has survived, though he has lost his standing as the favorite in the Republican primary on July 21.
In interviews around the nation, dozens of politicians and candidates at the local and national levels, as well as voters and political strategists, reeled off names of politicians with checkered personal lives who would have been too ashamed to even contemplate running for office a decade or more ago. But these days, candidates offer their missteps to the voters as evidence that they have nothing to hide and have learned from their transgressions.
The months, even years, of allegations about President Clinton's private life seem to have toughened -- and often exasperated -- an electorate that now has more realistic expectations and is not as quick to put politicians on a pedestal or expect them to be happily married. A result is that instead of retreating to the shadows, politicians and spouses are boldly fighting back -- telling voters that job performance, not personal conduct, is all that is relevant.
Borrowing from the Hillary Rodham Clinton playbook, some spouses are, literally, standing by their husbands. In February, Bea Romer stood quietly by as Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, acknowledged a 16-year "very affectionate relationship" with a longtime aide. His approval rating is still an impressive 68 percent.
On Thursday, Mrs. Bowers confessed to a crush of reporters at the campaign's headquarters here: "Quite honestly, our marriage hit rock bottom. After many hours of soul searching and discussion, we said there is enough of a fiber left not to get a divorce but to go forward."
These changed public attitudes are not simply a response to an era in which Paula Corbin Jones and a roster of other women have been unable to topple Mr. Clinton. They have come about gradually, particularly since 1987, when Senator Gary Hart of Colorado quit the Democratic Presidential primaries after disclosures about his extramarital activities involving a young woman. "We are all a little prurient about other people's lives," Mr. Hart said this week. "But voters have been much more sophisticated in judging character and understanding that character is demonstrated over a lifetime in many, many ways -- all of one's personal relationships and the esteem of one's colleagues."
One sign of what Mr. Hart described as "a new age of maturity" among voters is that the notion of an unmarried President -- something that once would have unnerved voters -- rarely comes up in speculation about the ambitions of two single Senators, Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, and Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee.
 
A New Tolerance, But Still More Scrutiny
Even flagrant adultery does not always sink a candidate.
In Florida, for example, State Senator John McKay, a Republican, was accused by his former wife of having an affair with a lobbyist who was promoting a bill he steered through the Senate. Mr. McKay married the lobbyist, and has since made amends with a state representative who had accused Mr. McKay of throttling him and threatening to kill him.
Yet Mr. McKay is undaunted. He appears headed for an easy re-election in November, mostly because he is viewed as a powerful Senator who has been skilled at pumping money into his southwest Florida district.
Despite a new tolerance, many politicians described an atmosphere in which, more than ever before, they must brace for the likelihood that the most sordid details of their private lives will surface, because the press and political rivals alike are more willing to raise such matters. That reality has caused some potential candidates to decide not to run.
"We'll never know what leaders we've lost out of this," Mr. Hart said.
While voters may be less likely to turn on candidates who are willing to come clean about their messy private lives, politicians said, they are less apt to give their blessing to candidates whose conduct makes them appear hypocritical or who are not forthcoming about admitting their mistakes. Candidates say they have also found that voters often are more forgiving of a politician's personal misdeeds than financial improprieties, especially when Government money is involved.
More than politics, the shift in attitudes may reflect a maturing culture in which Americans are more aware of the realities of private lives.
"Fifty years ago, everybody who was in politics was male and white and everybody who worked in the media was the same and 95 percent of the people were married," said Mayor Marc Morial of New Orleans, a Democrat. "Now you just have a different climate."
When Mr. Morial was elected in 1994, he endured a barrage of personal attacks for, among other things, fathering a child out of wedlock. But he said such matters "never came up" in his campaign this year because "the public is smart enough to decipher through it -- I had a record and I had some personal credibility." He was re-elected in February with 79 percent of the vote.
Another Democrat who is banking on his credibility is Raymond L. Flynn, who recently stepped down as United States Ambassador to the Vatican and for years was the Mayor of Boston. He said an article late last year in The Boston Globe that described him as a longtime problem drinker -- which he vehemently denies -- reflected a new willingness by the press to pry into politicians' private lives but would not deter his run for Governor this year.
"People can identify with politicians as just regular people who have faults and who make many mistakes," he said. "They don't look at them as puritanical icons. It's just the frailty of life."
Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who disclosed his homosexuality in 1987, has had no trouble winning re-election since revealing two years later that he had hired a male prostitute.
"If you're a spouse beater, people are going to be concerned -- and they should be," Mr. Frank said. "But the culture has moved away from an acceptance of rules that sex is only legitimate when two people are married to each other."
Here in Georgia, Mr. Bowers is hoping that he, too, will benefit from a more understanding public. He said the issue was "a recognition of the frailty of mankind."
"People are very forgiving because they see their own story," Mr. Bowers said in an interview. "This is America's dirty laundry, the tale of every family in some ways."
He was heartened by a Kiwanis Club luncheon this week in the small, largely conservative town of Buford, north of here. No members asked him about his affair. That morning, the local newspaper had written about an article in George magazine in which Mr. Bowers's former mistress, Anne Davis, spoke out for the first time, saying he had sent her money to help with expenses even after the relationship had ended.
"When this first came out, I said, 'No -- I definitely will not vote for him,' " Milton Califf, a furniture salesman who is treasurer of the club, said of Mr. Bowers. "But I've had a change of heart. His views, what he wants to accomplish, is something we really need."
Mr. Califf, 56, said he would not have been understanding a decade or so ago. "It would have been an open-and-shut case," he said. "But you see so much of this nowadays -- from the Presidency on down. It's the tolerance thing."
 
Past Drug Use No Apparent Problem
As Mr. Bowers was trying to contain his trouble, State Senator Mark Taylor, one of several Democrats running for lieutenant governor of Georgia, unexpectedly found himself this week discussing his indulgence in cocaine and marijuana in the 1980's. The Macon Telegraph received, anonymously, court documents about the past drug use of Mr. Taylor, who said his "casual, recreational use" ended 15 years ago.
The disclosure did not make big headlines here -- perhaps because it came the same day as the new disclosures about Mr. Bowers -- and his advisers were confident that Mr. Taylor could continue his campaign.
"I think we're well past the point where the admission of a youthful experimentation with drugs is an automatic disqualifer," said Alan Secrest, Mr. Taylor's pollster.
Mr. Secrest says he warns candidates to expect information on their private lives to seep out, but that such disclosures were far less likely than in the past to hurt a candidate.
"I sit in meeting after meeting these days with candidates at every level discussing information about opponents that would have destroyed their candidacy as recently as 8 to 10 years ago," Mr. Secrest said, "but today might not be nearly so damaging a negative in voters' eyes. It's more difficult to shock people."
One explanation for the inability to shock has nothing to do with voters' moral judgments and everything to do with the economy: several politicians and strategists said people were so pleased with the economy that they had less interest in a candidate's private life.
"The outrage of the American people toward the peccadilloes of their politicians is inversely proportional to the state of the economy," said Warren B. Rudman, the former Republican Senator from New Hampshire who headed the Ethics Committee.
Robust economy or not, many candidates this year still may find themselves in unexpectedly tough contests because of their private conduct. Disclosures about candidates' private lives are still most worrisome when their records are not well known to the voters, or their record smacks of hypocrisy.
In Washington State, Democrats plan to attack Representative Rick White, a Republican, for divorcing his wife of 16 years. Mr. White may be on the defensive not because of the divorce itself but because he had aggressively presented himself to voters as a devoted family man.
Laura Ruderman, a former program manager at Microsoft who is seeking the Democratic nomination, said Mr. White's divorce would be an important element of her campaign.
"I absolutely believe it makes him more vulnerable," said Ms. Ruderman, who is also single. "It's not the fact of the divorce -- it's the hypocrisy of running on how important your family is and then destroying it."
Ms. Ruderman said that while she will raise the issue directly "at some point," she will not stress Mr. White's divorce when she announces her candidacy on Monday because, among other things, "He has kids that are old enough to read about this in the paper."
Mr. White, in a statement after his divorce became official on Wednesday, said, "I'm glad that these issues are now behind us so we can focus on raising our children."
 
When a Haunting Past Cannot Be Put Aside
If there was any question that Mr. Bowers was in trouble in Georgia, there was no doubt this week when his campaign distributed to the press results of a poll in which 36 percent said he should drop out of the race. The rationale was that a larger proportion -- 64 percent -- said he should not quit.
Mr. Bowers, who is 56 and met his wife when he was a cadet at West Point 35 years ago, is especially vulnerable because of what he readily acknowledges was hypocritical behavior: he had drawn national attention as a straight-arrow conservative who, as the State Attorney General, successfully defended Georgia's anti-sodomy law before the United States Supreme Court.
Last summer, when he first acknowledged the affair with Ms. Davis, who once worked as a waitress in a Playboy Club, it was as if Mr. Bowers had written his own political obituary -- or handed his rivals a sound bite that was too good to be true. "It's just hypocritical morally," he said of his behavior.
But most disturbing for Mr. Bowers is that his disclosure last summer enticed Guy Millner, a wealthy businessman who narrowly lost previous campaigns for governor and the United States Senate, to enter the race. A poll shows that Mr. Millner is the heavy favorite for the Republican nomination.
Yet even if Mr. Bowers confounds the experts and becomes governor, neither he nor other candidates whose pasts have haunted them are likely to recover fully from attacks on their character. Mr. Bowers was not entirely joking when he warned a Kiwanis Club member at the luncheon: "You're in danger of ruining your reputation sitting next to me."
Mr. Flynn put it this way: "You may survive it -- you may even win the election. But you're never the same. You don't have the high moral authority to govern the way you want to. Is the goal to survive? Or is the goal to be able to govern effectively?"

HEADLINE: Workfare Can't Work Without Better Child Care;
Taxing Poor Families

 BODY:

To the Editor:
While three more states -- Maine, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania -- stopped taxing the poorest families in 1997 (news article, April 13), New York City has the dubious distinction of taxing families too poor to pay state or Federal income taxes. 
 A study by the city's Independent Budget Office finds that inflation has eroded the value of the city's household income tax credit over the past 10 years. At the same time, Federal and state programs to decrease the income tax burden on the working poor have become more generous.
As a result, this year nearly 100,000 households will pay personal income taxes to the city but not to the state and Federal governments -- more than triple the number of households affected in 1993.
This could be remedied for $30 million a year by creating a nonrefundable earned-income tax credit in conjunction with a local child care credit.

HEADLINE: Workfare Can't Work Without Better Child Care;
A Cage, Not a Pedestal

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re your April 17 editorial and the lack of day care for workfare participants: According to the historian William Chafe, in 1947-48 the administration of Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York, seeking to force mothers out of the work force, fought successfully to eliminate the publicly financed day care centers created during World War II. 
 As Mr. Chafe writes, since "seven out of eight families using the centers could not earn a living wage unless the mother worked . . . the state youth commissioner suggested that working mothers might better go on relief so that they could care for their children" at home.
In 1973 Justice William J. Brennan Jr. decried such "protective" policies, which, he said, "place women not on a pedestal but in a cage." The attitude that single motherhood cannot exempt women from attaining economic self-sufficiency has not been accompanied by an effort to alleviate the burdens of child rearing, which still fall disproportionately on mothers, especially single mothers.

The Earth and the Sky
 By Debbie Lee Wesselman.
 Southern Methodist University, cloth, $22.50; paper, $12.95. 
 Although Debbie Lee Wesselman sets the 15 stories in her elegant debut collection all over the globe, few of her characters find a place where they can feel comfortable and connected. Many are whisked to opposite ends of the earth, some face unscalable language barriers and others, like Elisabetta in the title story, confess, "I felt homesick, even though I stood on my own property." In many of the stories, isolation springs from an inner feeling of incompleteness. Ellen, an American wife living in her husband's native Japan, "had come to think of a life as a series of little string pieces knotted together, one at a time, to form a misshapen doll." Father Paolo in "Rosa's Vision," "a spiritual man" who has served a parish in rural Chile for three decades, suddenly realizes that he "had not an inkling of exactly what spirituality was." Several stories are intertwined. "Life as a Dragon" and "Stone Daughter" present mirror images of women dragged thousands of miles by marriage. Two stories set in Taiwan end with their protagonists witnessing the same horrible scene. But the strongest story is set in the heart of America. "Core Puncher" features a Rhode Island woman who has lost her daughter to bone cancer and now chases tornadoes out West -- because only something this powerful can still touch her. Andy Solomon
International-law experts say it isn't clear whether such intent is necessary to convict, because Kovacevic is accused not of genocide itself but of complicity in genocide. It might be enough to show that he deliberately contributed to the crime even though he may not have had genocidal intent, said Diane Orentlicher, a professor at American University's Washington College of Law and director of its War Crimes Research Office. "Suppose someone built gas ovens knowing how they'd be used in the Holocaust, but didn't carry out the gassings himself," Orentlicher hypothesized. "He might not have shared Hitler's genocidal intent, but might well be liable to punishment as an accomplice to genocide."
It is easier to convict Omarska's guards, the men who personally tortured and killed, whose crimes were witnessed by dozens of people. The role of the higher-ups is more elusive. According to D'Amato, Karadzic wrote orders telling his men not to commit war crimes and warning that anyone who did would be prosecuted -- an utterly cynical exercise, if in fact he did do it, but one that could keep him out of prison: the commanders weren't really commanding, couldn't have done anything, had no control, didn't plan it, couldn't have stopped it, didn't know.
Showing that Kovacevic had no responsibility for the events in Prijedor was one aspect of the strategy Vucicevic outlined during the trip. The other was to argue that what happened in Prijedor was not a Serb-organized genocide at all. In fact, he was looking for evidence that the Muslims in and around Prijedor were planning a genocide of their own -- that the Serbs, in rounding up Muslims, acted in self-defense.
D'Amato strongly disagreed with this strategy, in part for tactical reasons: he thought that contesting the prosecutor's assertion that what happenened to the Muslims was genocide would bring a parade of unhelpful witnesses testifying about the atrocities they suffered in the camps. "This court was set up to investigate genocide," he said. "I'm not sure they would be prepared to say it didn't occur." His view that the no-genocide defense was doomed was echoed by every non-Serb lawyer I asked about it.
"Any claim to justify genocide on the grounds that it is designed to prevent genocide by an adversary, a sort of anticipatory genocide, is simply beyond the pale," said Theodor Meron, Denison Professor of International Law at New York University Law School. "In international law's hierarchy of prohibitions, those of genocide and crimes against humanity are absolute. There are no exceptions."
Vucicevic, for his part, said he has no intention of acknowledging that there was a Serb-led genocide. "Let's be good old-fashioned defense attorneys and make them prove every point," he told me at first. But as I spent more time with Vucicevic in Prijedor, it became evident that his real reason for denying that genocide had been carried out was that he believed his people had been maligned in the press and wanted to correct the record. "D'Amato's been prejudiced by media stories and pictures," he said.
D'Amato had told me that many Serbs believe something "a little schizo: it's not genocide, but if it is, it's totally justified." Most of the Serbs I met in Prijedor hold this view. More disconcerting, at times so did Vucicevic. He seemed fully aware of the tensions between the American and Serb inside him. "I get so mad at everyone here for the war," he said. "But I guess I have some of these genes myself."
Though there are undoubtedly Serbs in Prijedor who would say out loud that Muslims were victims of Serb atrocities, what I found was a list of excuses and justifications, often contradictory. Typical was the view of Zoran Baros, then as now the director of the propaganda-spewing Radio Prijedor, who said that the Serbs had to act to prevent a takeover of Prijedor by Muslim extremists. And this from a high-ranking Prijedor police official who spoke only on condition of anonymity: "Write about the 11,000 Serb children killed in the Kozara Mountains in World War II. Perhaps you will have a deeper understanding of why this happened in 1992."
Since most of these men began our conversations with a denunciation of the anti-Serb foreign media, I was not expecting any of them to unburden their consciences to me. They were also aware of the tribunal's secret list. But the justifications were not invented for my benefit. The imminent Muslim genocide and the victimization of Serbs were themes of the war.
The Serbs have been victims many times this century. The Ustashe Nazi puppet state in wartime Croatia had promised to kill, deport or convert to Catholicism the Serbs in Croatian territory. Because Serb partisans were particularly active in the Prijedor area, which borders Croatia, it was the scene of some of the worst killings of Serbs, including Serb children. The German Army also participated. Among those in the German Army in the Kozara Mountains at that time was Kurt Waldheim, which does not inspire Serb confidence in the United Nations. The Ustashe concentration camp of Jasenovac is an hour's drive from Prijedor. Tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of Serbs, depending on who does the counting, were murdered there. Many were killed with a brutality later to be echoed in Omarska. This is not a coincidence.
Kovacevic says he himself was interned as a baby in a Croatian concentration camp, although he is not sure which one. Almost every person I met in Prijedor replied to my questions about 1992 with references to 1942. This history made the propaganda believable to ordinary Serbs. A psychopath with a television station seems to be a necessary ingredient of modern genocide, but so does a historical resonance. (In Rwanda, genocide was sparked by a radio station that stirred up Hutu memories of victimization.) Television did not have to tell the Serbs, Go kill your neighbor. It was enough to tell them, Your neighbor is coming to kill you.
The Kovacevic family lives in a comfortable but not luxurious apartment on the fourth floor of a building at the edge of downtown, with firewood piled up in the yard and chickens scratching in the dirt. When I first visited the apartment, Kovacevic's 24-year-old son, Ljubo, was sitting on a leather couch in the living room, watching music videos on Sarajevo TV. When the news came on, showing Bosnia's President, Alija Izetbegovic, Ljubo jumped up in mock respect. He had once studied to be a veterinary technician, but now he mostly hung out, unemployed, like almost everyone in Prijedor.
Kovacevic's wife, Ljubica, a teacher of retarded children, brought out a cheese pie, salad, cake and a bottle of her husband's excellent homemade plum brandy, even though we were about to go out to eat. People have treated her well, she said, though she does get phone threats from one Muslim man -- whose voice she thinks she recognizes. We all went to dinner at the Balkan Express, a restaurant on the highway outside town that Kovacevic had considered his second office. Over very loud Serb folk songs sung by a woman with frosted hair and white high heels, Vucicevic and Zoran Baros, the Prijedor Radio boss, talked about supposed Muslim arms caches in Kozarac.
Ljubica Kovacevic mused: "It's the journalists who started the war. They showed us pictures of dead Serb children."
"That wasn't journalism," I said. "That was propaganda."
"I don't know what it was," she said. "It's what I saw."
Mostly, though, Ljubica sat silently, her thoughts obviously far away, saying at one point, "It's so despicable that a victim has to prove he's innocent."
It is not clear whether the people I talked to in Prijedor do not believe the reports of atrocities in Omarska and Keraterm or are simply lying.
On my last day in town I went to lunch with Vucicevic and the Kovacevic family at a restaurant near the hospital. At another table was Gojko Klickovic, the Prime Minister of the Serb Republic from May 1996 until three months ago and now head of the S.D.S. I went over with Vucicevic, and when the conversation turned to the war I asked how many people had died in the concentration camps. "People couldn't have died in concentration camps, because we didn't have them," Klickovic said. "We had detention camps, where people came beginning on the first day because it was the safest. The Red Cross then allowed them to relocate."
Back at our table, Vucicevic and I got into an argument. "He's not credible," I said.
"Maybe he didn't know," Vucicevic replied.
Of all the views I heard, Vucicevic's were the most disquieting. At times he was willing to acknowledge the horrors of the camps, at times he played them down and at times he excused them. "In tribal societies you have revenge and retaliation as justice," he said. "For 500 years, Serbs haven't known anything else."
Whatever bad happened was ordered from Belgrade, Vucicevic said, but he also often spoke of the Muslim threat. He gave me articles on genocide against the Serbs and recommended that I read a book on the Turkish genocide of Armenians, to show me what Muslims were capable of. When we were driving around Prijedor, he sometimes gave people we passed the three-fingered Serb salute, a sign used today by only the most nationalist Serbs. He also said: "When I heard Serbs were accused of raping Muslim women I had to laugh. When I was young we always joked that no one would want a Muslim because their personal hygiene is not too good."
Omarska, the former iron-ore mine, is today a military base for the Serb Republic's Army. Keraterm is starting to make ceramic tile again. Practically no Muslims have returned to live in Prijedor itself. In early March a few were beginning to commute daily from Sanski Most. One commuter was Muharem Murselovic, Prijedor's new Deputy Mayor -- elected because the surviving Muslims came back in large numbers to vote in municipal elections in September. He had been imprisoned in Omarska in the summer of 1992 and beaten repeatedly. Some of his Serb colleagues in the municipal building today had helped send him to the camp, he told me. "If they are uncomfortable to see me, that's their problem," he said. "I can look everyone in the eye."
The tribunal has improved the quality of leadership in Prijedor -- mainly by ridding the city of Drljaca, the former Police Chief, who continued to blow up Muslim houses and sponsor attacks on Muslims long after the war ended. And The Hague tribunal is scaring other wartime leaders. I heard a high-ranking police official ask Vucicevic if he knew which other names were on the sealed indictments list, and Vucicevic said that others had asked as well. He said that there are three or four former Crisis Staff members still in Prijedor but that they are keeping their heads down. Milomir Stakic, the former Mayor and Crisis Staff chief, who is probably on the list, is nowhere to be found. The tribunal is so present in the minds of Prijedor Serbs that the local prosecutor has been nicknamed Goldstone, after Richard Goldstone, the South African jurist who was the tribunal's first prosecutor.
After the hearing that quashed the expanded indictment, Vucicevic did phone interviews with radio stations all over the Serb Republic, telling them that for the first time a Serb defendant had won a victory at the tribunal. Such statements are important to counter the near-universal belief among Serbs that the tribunal is an anti-Serb instrument. The local media, of course, depict it that way.
This will have to change if the tribunal is to meet the ambitious goals of its founders. The tribunal's only legitimate purpose -- the only purpose a court can have -- is to mete out justice. But a successful tribunal will do other important things. On a practical level, it appears that fear of the tribunal may be preventing Serbian leaders from intensifying their violence in Kosovo, where tribunal prosecutors are beginning investigations. Beyond this, the tribunal makes a moral statement, showing that some crimes are so heinous that the whole world condemns and punishes them. Like Nuremberg's, its decisions will trickle into international treaties and national legal codes: thanks to Nuremberg, for example, most nations hold that soldiers cannot evade responsibility for illegal acts by pleading that they were following orders.
A successful tribunal may encourage the world to establish a permanent international criminal tribunal, which the United Nations is now discussing. It might also encourage the world's powers to examine their own roles in the tragedy of Yugoslavia and strengthen their resolve to prevent genocide the next time rather than settling for judging its perpetrators.
The tribunal's most fervid supporters have made more extravagant claims for the court as well. They believe the tribunal can discourage blind ethnic hatred by showing that responsibility rests with individuals, not whole groups. They see the tribunal as a means to promote tolerance by smashing the cherished myths of victimhood, demonstrating to people that individuals in their own ethnic group can also do evil.
Justice has helped to demolish nationalist myths. It did so in Japan and Germany. In these countries, however, justice was accompanied by Allied occupation. NATO's mission in Bosnia is no such occupation. Just as crucial, the myths of Nazism and Japanese imperialism did not truly die until they were discredited by the Germans and Japanese themselves, and this took time.
Time will not produce the same reckoning in the former Yugoslavia without efforts by the Serbs and Croats themselves, efforts like trials of their own war criminals or a South Africa-style truth commission that encourages the perpetrators to confess. Communism's state-enforced unity kept the Yugoslavs from dealing with World War II atrocities, and now nationalist governments, especially those in Serbia and Croatia, perpetuate the story of national victimhood. Fear is powerful, rationalization easy and remorse painful; truth will win out only if the message comes from one of your own.
There is one Prijedor leader who seems to be remorseful about the events of 1992. That is Milan Kovacevic. Not that he has abandoned the gospel of Greater Serbia. In 1996, Ed Vulliamy of The Guardian, who had listened to Kovacevic's speech on the subject four years earlier, sought him out again. Kovacevic reiterated the importance of making the area free of Muslims. But as the bottle of slivovitz came out, a different man emerged according to Vulliamy. "Omarska was planned as a reception center," Kovacevic said after four glasses. "But then it turned into something else. I cannot explain this loss of control. I don't think even the historians will explain it in the next 50 years. You could call it collective madness." He resigned from the Crisis Staff in December 1992. He left political life "because I saw many evil things," he told Vulliamy. "That is my personal secret. If you have to do things by killing people, well...now my hair is white, now I don't sleep too well."
Don't take that as an admission, D'Amato said; Kovacevic's anguish and remorse came after the war, when he learned what others did, and are not legally relevant. That is for the tribunal to decide. But the agonies of a drunk are relevant in other ways, if only Serbs could hear them. The tribunal may help prevent the next Balkan war by imprisoning some of the criminals of the last one and discouraging those who would follow. But its decisions will always be those of outsiders, powerless against the overwhelming emotional weight of Jasenovac, of 11,000 children murdered in the Kozara Mountains; against that malignantly selective memory that embraces ethnic hatred. Only anguish and remorse from those who once preached it can persuade people that they are human beings as well as victims, that those who remember history are also condemned to repeat it.

A brief review on page 24 of the Book Review today, about the novel "The Earth and the Sky," misspells the author's name. She is Debbie Lee Wesselmann, not Wesselman.
The cover article of The Times Magazine today describes the case of Milan Kovacevic, a Bosnian Serb who is to stand trial next month on a charge of complicity in genocide during the war in the former Yugoslavia. The article says that 46 Bosnian Serbs indicted on war-crime and other charges remain at large.
On Thursday, after the magazine had gone to press, one such man, Zoran Zigic, surrendered to the International Criminal Tribunal. He faces arraignment tomorrow in The Hague.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION;
Yes, America Has a Class System. See 'Frasier.'

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES 

 BODY:
DR. FRASIER CRANE'S apartment says a lot about him. The tan suede sofa is a copy of one Coco Chanel had in her Paris atelier. The view is the Seattle skyline. There are Lichtensteins on the wall, a baby grand in the alcove and a finely ground Kenya blend in the coffeemaker.
All Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) really wants is to be Cary Grant, but he can never quite pull it off. Even when he, his ex-wife and his brother find themselves in bathrobes (but let's call them dressing gowns) in a great Art Deco hotel room discussing irony, superegos, eggs Florentine and -- oh, by the way -- a tiny sexual infidelity, as he did in a recent episode, Frasier can't help summing it all up with "Well, isn't this peachy?" 
 And if Frasier's own failings weren't enough to sabotage his efforts at urban sophistication, there's his father, Martin Crane (John Mahoney), retired cop, beer drinker, television watcher, plain speaker, whose sense of style is symbolized by the dreadful striped easy chair with duct-tape accents that he has plunked down in the middle of his son's elegant minimalism.
The dangers of class mobility in America have never been more eloquently addressed. And class is a subject long overdue for discussion, now that three or four people have admitted that they would have liked Paula Jones better if she'd gone to all the right schools.
There may be a hundred reasons that "Frasier" has been a hit sitcom since NBC introduced it in 1993 or why it has won the best-comedy Emmy Award every year it has been on the air, but for many viewers the heart of the series is the Cranes' intrafamily culture clash, the kind that's bound to occur when blue-collar Americans send their children to Harvard.
American television has never dealt much with the class system, possibly because of the lingering belief that we don't have one. Most series have picked a socioeconomic level and stuck with it: struggling working class from "The Life of Riley" to "Roseanne," solidly, comfortably middle class from "Father Knows Best" to "Home Improvement," or filthy rich on "Dallas" and "Dynasty."
One of the few conspicuously rich households on the 1998 schedule belongs to Maxwell Sheffield on "The Nanny," a sitcom about a Broadway producer with a British accent who hires and learns to love a loud young woman with a Queens accent and very short skirts. The class gap on "The Nanny" is exaggerated for broad laughs, just as a larger gap was on "The Beverly Hillbillies" 30 years ago. Even "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," Will Smith's sitcom about an inner-city teen-ager relocated to his wealthy relatives' home in a posh part of Los Angeles, tended to rely on stereotypes about the stuffy rich.
The closest thing to a serious portrayal of class mobility must have been "The Millionaire," the 1950's series about a billionaire who liked to amuse himself by giving $1 million (tax free, that was the great part) to some deserving stranger. The half-hour was devoted to the story of how the lucky man or woman handled that new-found wealth -- usually badly.
But on innumerable shows, especially rags-to-riches mini-series, that sort of transition is a snap. Maybe that's because television has usually treated class differences as if they were strictly about net worth. Lucy and Ricky Ricardo often had more money than Fred and Ethel Mertz, because Ricky was a successful band leader (and eventually a movie actor), but they never seemed to have different tastes in fashion, food or art. At least not to the degree found among the Cranes.
Viewers quickly learned who they were dealing with during the first season of "Frasier" when, over latte at Cafe Nervosa, Frasier's dapper brother, Niles, described a trick he had played on someone at his wine club: switching labels between a Chateau Petrus and a Fourcas-Dupre. "What scamps you are!" said Frasier. "His face must have turned redder than a Pichon-Longueville." The difference between the brothers is that Frasier knows they're being pretentious; Niles honestly doesn't.
David Hyde Pierce, who plays Niles, has said that his character was originally explained to him as "what Frasier would be if he had never gone to Boston and never been exposed to the people at Cheers."
Frasier's character was created in 1984 for "Cheers," then NBC's highest-rated sitcom, as a love interest for Diane Chambers (Shelley Long). A psychiatrist with elbow patches and pear-shaped vowels, he was an educated and sophisticated contrast to the jovially working-class gang that hung out at the show's namesake Boston bar. Diane left Frasier at the altar, but he kept his seat at the bar, looking down his nose at the others' failings for eight more seasons. Luckily for Frasier, Martin never flew into town to reveal his son's humble origins. "Cheers," in the tradition of a class-free America, acknowledged taste and economic differences, but in script after script it insisted that the postal worker and the professor might really socialize.
Back in Seattle, Frasier has given that sort of thing up, possibly because he gets enough blue-collar atmosphere at home.
Maybe, the Crane boys sometimes wonder, there was a switched-at-birth mistake at the hospital. "Frasier, is he our real father?" Niles once asked. Frasier answered tolerantly: "Now don't start that again. We've been having this discussion since we were children."
At times the brothers think they might be able to sophisticate Martin by exposing him to the finer things. Frasier recalls that even their own tastes were not always beyond reproach. "Remember," he tells Niles, "when you used to think the 1812 Overture was a great piece of classical music?" Niles smiles wistfully. "Was I ever that young?" he says.
But that strategy doesn't work, and neither does Frasier's attempt to buy his father an Armani suit. Martin insists on stopping at a discount store, where he finds a wrinkle-resistant sharkskin ensemble instead. Offered any restaurant in town for his birthday celebration, Dad wants to go to Hoppy's Old Heidelberg. Which may be better than the steak place he once dragged his sons to, where patrons choose their meal from "the steak trolley" and anyone wearing a necktie has it cut off -- even if it's Hugo Boss.
Although Frasier earns his living in broadcasting (giving psychiatric advice on a radio call-in show), he makes fun of his father's unfortunate television habit. When he buys Martin a telescope, he says, "Just think of it as having 100 more channels to watch."
But Martin won't let his sons undermine his confidence in his common-man tastes and often gives as good as he gets. He refers to Frasier's breakfast of a bran muffin and a touch of yogurt as "girlie food" and corrects Niles when he describes the cuisine at a certain restaurant as "to die for." "Niles, your country and your family are to die for," Martin reminds him. "Food is to eat." Martin isn't oblivious to changing standards around him; he just thinks they're insane. "A dollar fifty for coffee?" he says in one show. "What kind of world are we living in?"
One of Martin's finest moments comes when Frasier, planning an old-fashioned live radio play, explains to Niles, "People of Dad's generation would sit around at night listening to the radio, absolutely mesmerized." Before Niles has a chance to say that yes, he's well aware of that, Martin gives his older son a look and says, "We were a simple people."
One reason "Frasier" works is that both classes are made up of good people with values, which happen to be expressed in different ways. The show gives both coastal yuppies and Middle America a good name.
Kelsey Grammer once described his character, at a Museum of Television and Radio seminar, as "flawed and silly and pompous and full of himself" but "genuinely kind" and "totally vulnerable."
And then there's Niles. Niles, who is so out of touch with the mainstream that he explains creative visualization by suggesting that a radio listener might have "a dog-eared copy of 'Middlemarch' " nearby. That he tries to order a Stoli gibson with three pearl onions at a theme restaurant. (Niles who, by the way, mentions his $400 Bruno Maglis months before O. J. Simpson mentions his.) Niles of the cute smirk and boyish blond good looks (Leonardo DiCaprio in 15 years, if he takes care of himself) and tart tongue. Lilith, Frasier's formidable ex-wife, is in town? "Ah," says Niles, "that explains why blood was pouring from all my faucets this morning."
But also Niles who, despite his elegance, can't dance ("Start with your left foot," suggests his instructor. "Which one?" Niles asks, all too honestly). And who has a painful case of unspoken, unrequited love for Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), his father's young English (working-class) live-in physical therapist.
Which could begin a list of things the "Frasier" writers are doing right: unrequited love as an opportunity for bawdy double-entendre (Daphne to Niles: "I'm beginning to think I should spend an hour or two on the couch with you"), the lovable dog whom the lead character hates, Niles's never-seen monster of an estranged wife and occasional excursions into farce.
THE writers throw in literary and theatrical references -- without explanation, God bless them -- to the likes of Dorothy Parker ("What fresh hell is this?"), "A Chorus Line" ("I'm a dancer. A dancer dances.") and "Hamlet," sort of ("We're a hit. A palpable hit.").
While most sitcoms change scenes with a shot of the exterior of a building and some perky music, "Frasier" does it with subtitles, like "A Coupla White Guys Sittin' 'Round Talkin' " and "Could Guy's Last Name Be Feydeau?"
The show is just plain smart. But America might not forgive the Crane brothers their sophistication, their culinary pretensions and their decorating budgets if they didn't have Martin around to remind them where they came from.

HEADLINE: Sandra J. Holmes, 57, Creator Of Yonkers Group to Aid Poor

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
The Rev. Sandra Jishu Holmes, a Zen Buddhist priest, teacher and co-founder of the Greyston Mandala, an organization in Yonkers dedicated to helping the poor, died on Feb. 20 at a hospital in Albuquerque, N.M. She was 57 and had moved last month to Santa Fe, N.M., from Yonkers.
The cause was a heart attack, the Greyston Foundation announced. 
 Ms. Holmes and her husband, Roshi Bernard Tetsugen Glassman, a Zen teacher, founded a group of nonprofit and for-profit companies and gave it the name of the Buddhist and Hindu circle of life, the mandala. As a team in meditation and activism, the couple helped renovate dilapidated buildings to house the homeless. They also aided the homeless with training, jobs in the Greyston Bakery and children's services.
They worked with drug addicts and alcoholics, former offenders and the chronically unemployed to offer an alternative to government programs. The couple opened a building for 19 families with a day care center and access to social services in 1991. The group's for-profit bakery produces cakes, tarts and chocolate-fudge brownie chips for Ben & Jerry's ice cream and frozen yogurt.
Ms. Holmes retired in 1996 as director of new projects at the Greyston Foundation, the umbrella organization of the Greyston Group. She and her husband then founded the Zen Peacemaking Order, an international community that pursues meditation and interfaith expression and whose headquarters they recently moved to New Mexico.
Ms. Holmes was born in Oakland, Calif. She received a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Columbia University in 1976. After meeting Mr. Glassman in 1982, she devoted herself to Zen Buddhist study and practice. She became a Zen priest in 1983 and, four years ago, a teacher.
In addition to her husband, she is survived by her parents, Guy and Audrey Holmes of Stockton, Calif., and three brothers: David, of Plattsburgh, N.Y., Vernon, of Oakland, and Warren, of Stockton.

A New Type of Landlord Buys Stamford Properties

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
FROM the late 60's to the mid-80's, while Stamford was in the throes of urban renewal, it was routinely referred to as the city without an identity.
Once it gained acceptance in the 90's as a Northeastern financial and business hub, its substantial cluster of office towers along Interstate 95 began attracting the attention of real estate investment trusts -- publicly traded companies that buy, manage, and sell properties from massive portfolios. 
 So far, three REITs have entered the Stamford market. Two have established a formidable presence by acquiring more than half of the city's 4.7 million square feet of Class A office space. Stamford has a total of 14 million square feet of offices.
Equity Office Properties Trust of Chicago owns seven buildings with 1.6 million square feet, and Reckson Associates Realty Trust of Melville, L.I.,, has acquired 1.1 million square feet in two buildings. A third REIT, Mack-Cali of Cranford, N.J., has acquired 167,000 square feet in three mixed office-warehouse buildings outside downtown.
Jeffrey R. Dunne, the senior vice president at CB Commercial in Stamford, sees the growth of REITs as an unstoppable trend here as it is across the country. "There is ample out-of-town REIT interest from California, Pennsylvania and New York that will translate into more REITs coming here," he said.
Nineteen Stamford buildings, some designed as headquarters for long-gone corporations like Champion International and the Singer Corporation, were built by a single local company, F. D. Rich, designated by the city in the 1960's to be sole redeveloper of the downtown urban renewal district.
"Stamford was a unique place for 30 years," said Robert N. Rich, the president of the company founded by his father, Frank D. Rich, in 1920. Frank D. Rich Jr., Robert's brother, is the company chairman.
"Not many communities had a single developer with with such an overriding interest," Robert Rich said. "That's hard to replicate. As the REITs come in, if there are families in control, like Reckson, a lot of that focus is maintained. On the other hand, you take a company like Equity Office, they can't conceivably have the same kind of interest. That's not a criticism, it's the reality." The REITs, he added, "bring tremendous financial backup to their operations."
"We've been through cycles with vacancies in the high 20-percent range and we will go through it again," he said. "I don't think REITs will have a problem because they are not invested as heavily. They have 30 percent debt, while a private company tends to have 70 to 80 percent. And they have access to money we didn't have."
During the recession, the Rich empire succumbed to overbuilding and focusing too closely on one location -- downtown Stamford. Most of their properties were foreclosed. Today its holdings are in San Juan, P.R., Springfield, Mass., and outside Syracuse. In Stamford it retains a one-third interest in its High Ridge Park complex of 500,000 square feet in six buildings, and it will take title in June to a three-acre urban renewal tract on Broad Street opposite the new University of Connecticut branch, as spelled out in its contract with the city.
Robert Rich's son Tom will eventually head the company. He is marketing the Broad Street property, which, under current zoning, can accommodate 295,000 square feet of office and retail space and up to 260 rental apartments, condominiums, hotel rooms or student units. "Our future focus," Tom Rich said, "will be the New York metro area, including New York City."
Equity Office moved into Stamford in 1993, when it was called Zell-Merrill Lynch Real Estate Opportunities Partners Limited Partnership. It bought four Rich buildings -- 1, 2, and 3 Stamford Plaza, and 300 Atlantic Street -- as well as Canterbury Green, an office and apartment complex. For a total of $132 million, Zell-Merrill Lynch became the city's largest landlord.
When the firm reorganized as Equity Office in 1994 it retained the five buildings and acquired two additional Rich buildings, 177 Broad Street and 4 Stamford Plaza.
"When we first came into the Stamford market a number of real estate players questioned our sanity," said Christopher P. Mundy, the senior regional vice president for Equity Office in Washington, D.C. "We purchased these assets at significant discounts to replacements costs, and we are still very bullish. In 1993 annual rents were in the low $20's a square foot, now they are north of $30 a foot, and demand has been very strong. We are 98 percent occupied in a city where Class A buildings have a vacancy rate of about 4.5 percent. Companies are still coming out here because the owners live here and don't want to commute."
Responding to Robert Rich's comment that a family firm is more involved with the community, Mr. Mundy said: "Not being involved in a family situation, we can look at things straightforwardly and react to change more quickly."
ONE F. D. Rich building that Equity Office did not acquire was Landmark Square, the signature six-building complex containing 800,000 square feet of offices and the Town Center Mall. It cost $35 million to build in 1973, and was sold to Reckson by Metropolitan Life Insurance in 1996 for $77 million.
At the same time, Reckson also acquired two Rich family members. F. D. Rich 3d, known as Rick, became the managing director of Reckson's Southern Connecticut Division housed in Landmark Square. He is currently overseeing an $11.5 million rehabilitation of the Landmark complex. His sister, Susan M. Rich, was made vice president of leasing and marketing in Reckson's Connecticut and Westchester offices.
Mr. Rich said "it was a difficult decision" to leave the family firm. "But given the difficulties that the Rich companies had experienced," he said, "I felt that for my own needs it was time to make a change. I wanted to participate in real estate in a fashion that the industry is headed towards -- consolidation."
Scott Rechler, 30, president of Reckson, is also a third-generation member of his family's business. "It was one of the things that attracted us to each other," he said, "and Rick has all the relationships required in his market, which is one of our strongest."
"Reckson and Equity Office have clearly become major players" said Robert C. Miller, the vice president of commercial real estate at William Pitt in Stamford. "But I think there's a misconception that the REITs are buying everything in town. There is still plenty held by local people."
The Collins Development Company of Greenwich, for example, built and still owns Harbor Plaza, with 735,000 square feet, and 9 West Broad Street, with 185,000 square feet. And it has plans for a major mixed-use waterfront development and a 150,000-square-foot office building.
Hoffman Brothers' one million square feet is distributed among wholly or jointly owned buildings at High Ridge Park, at 707, 773 and 777 Summer Street; 969 High Ridge Road, and various small buildings and shopping centers. W & M Properties continues to own its elegant Metro Center, with 280,000 square feet, and Soundview Plaza, with 180,000 square feet. Clearwater Associates has 285,000 square feet jointly owned with partners at Clearwater House, Atlantic House and Seaview House.
Arthur Collins, chairman of the Collins Development Company, likes REITs. "They are the major source of purchasers of existing buildings in the country and in Stamford," he said. "Their source of money in a growth market is creating high capitalization rates and establishing strong market values."
But John H. Rostenberg has reservations. His Connecticut and Westchester real estate brokerage, Rostenberg-Doern, was sold last year to Insignia/ESG, which is not a REIT.
"REITs are squeezing out a lot of mid-sized brokerage firms," he said. "As REITs buy buildings that they rent themselves and manage themselves, it means brokerages have less to market. Big insurance companies were dominant owners in the 70's and 80's; in the 90's and probably the next decade it will be REITs. Meantime the industry will become extremely institutionalized. Wall Street is taking over the real estate business."
Insignia/ESG, a publicly traded company, does not buy real estate. It buys brokerages or establishes new brokerages that handle sales, purchases and leases of buildings, and it serves as manager of the buildings. "We frequently sell to REITs," said Steven Iacco, a spokesman for Insignia. "Mr. Rostenberg handled the sale of Stamford Towers to Reckson for the former owner, Lehman Brothers." Stamford Towers contains 318,000 square feet and was not built by the Rich company.
"The problem for REITs is what's left to acquire," said Kip Bergstrom, the director of economic development for Stamford. "Virtually all the buildings in Stamford are in the hands of active investors, including Reckson and Equity Office. They are improving their properties with top-of-the-line amenities, and that has been very good for the Stamford market."

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
A Broken Pact and a $97 Million Payday

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA FALLS, Mont.

 BODY:
IN 1985, the Columbia Falls Aluminum Company wrung a 15 percent pay cut from employees in return for an apparent will-o'-the-wisp: a share of profits from an aluminum refinery that was a perennial money loser.
Brack W. Duker, the corporate executive who had just bought the refinery from the Atlantic Richfield Company for a symbolic $1, held out a firm promise, many workers recall. If the aluminum market ever recovered, Mr. Duker assured them as he lobbied for the plan, "a dollar in your pocket is a dollar in mine." 
 In the end, the workers reluctantly accepted the offer. And the price of aluminum did in fact recover -- far beyond anyone's expectations. Starting in 1986, Columbia Falls Aluminum became a money-making machine.
But over the next five years, rather than splitting the take, Mr. Duker and his minority partner, Jerome Broussard, funneled much of the money into offshore bank accounts. Before they cut off their union and salaried employees altogether, the two men had awarded $84 million to them and $231 million to themselves. As it turned out, a dollar in the pockets of workers would be nearly $3 in those of the owners.
In 1989, Mr. Duker and Mr. Broussard dismissed their chief financial officer after he raised concerns about their financial practices. With him gone, and with the plant's work force more concerned about job security than profit-sharing checks, there seemed to be no end to the gravy train.
But there was something ahead on the tracks that would derail it -- a 39-year-old accountant at the plant named Roberta Gilmore, who challenged the company's bookkeeping practices and was promptly told, she says, to keep her mouth shut.
Instead, after fuming for a couple of years, she filed a lawsuit. What ensued was a classic David-versus-Goliath business tale, a battle that from the beginning seemed almost hopeless for Ms. Gilmore and the workers. At one point, the two small-town lawyers she hired showed up in Federal Court in Missoula, Mont., wearing polar fleece jackets and Sorel boots. They were greeted by Mr. Duker -- flanked by three bodyguards and 13 lawyers in finely tailored suits.
Clearly, Mr. Duker had the upper hand in any war of attrition. And yet, five years and 10 months after the suit was filed, he threw in the towel. Just two weeks before Ms. Gilmore's lawsuit was scheduled for trial, he agreed to pay the workers $97 million -- nearly double his previous offer and eight times the initial proposal he made in 1995. When she heard the news, Ms. Gilmore broke into sobs.
Her unlikely victory has a special resonance in an era when everything seems stacked against blue-collar workers. Union membership is continuing a long decline; inflation-adjusted wages are stagnant, and millions of low-paid Americans struggle without health insurance. And all the while, the rich get richer: Executives at big corporations receive stratospheric compensation packages, and shareholders reap huge windfalls just by sitting back and watching the Dow industrials defy the law of gravity.
This time, though, romance wins and the workers are cashing in. More than 1,000 current and former employees at the refinery here will be getting checks this month, ranging from a few thousand dollars to more than $300,000, depending on their length of service. But no one is celebrating it as an unambiguous victory. For even though the workers received far more than they ever thought they would, they also believe that Mr. Duker and Mr. Broussard are walking away with $57 million that is rightfully theirs, too.
"There's not a feeling anybody won," said Terry Smith, president of the Aluminum Workers' Trade Council, the hourly workers' union. "There's a feeling of relief."
This account is based mainly on court documents and interviews with workers and their lawyers. Both Mr. Duker and Mr. Broussard declined to be interviewed. But the thrust of their position -- as articulated in court records, a company response to written questions and telephone interviews with one of their lawyers -- is that there was no binding profit-sharing agreement. Furthermore, they contend that the complexities of the corporate-tax system accounted for much of the gap between what they paid workers and what they paid themselves.
While declining to go into specifics, the lawyer, Mark Shipow of Los Angeles, disputed the plaintiffs' calculation of the size of that disparity. "The numbers are wrong and their figuring is wrong," he said last week.
 
A Refinery for $1
The 40-acre aluminum refinery here, built in the 1950's to take advantage of cheap hydroelectric power, looks as if it had been airlifted from the Rust Belt and dropped into one of the most breath-stealing stretches of wilderness in America. Grizzly bears, wolves and moose roam the forests just north of this town of 3,000 people, just a few miles south of the jagged blue mountains of Glacier National Park.
In 1985, ARCO was selling its metal division and wanted to get rid of the Columbia Falls plant, which was losing money. So the oil company devised a plan to sell it for $1 (plus $3 million for the inventory) to Mr. Duker, an ARCO executive in charge of divesting unwanted properties.
As part of the deal, the two sides agreed that workers would take a major share of all future profits, if any materialized. In a one-and-a-half-page letter to Mr. Duker -- a document that would become pivotal evidence more than a decade later in Ms. Gilmore's lawsuit -- ARCO spelled out that condition, saying employees "will have a claim against at least 50 percent of the profits earned in each year." Far from objecting, court records show, Mr. Duker embraced the idea, originally suggesting that employees should receive 90 percent, not just half.
As soon as Mr. Duker and Mr. Broussard took over, they started a drive to cut operating costs, wielding the threat of closing the plant as leverage with politicians and government agencies. With the entire town behind them, they won huge cuts in the plant's electricity rates and property taxes.
A linchpin of the cost-cutting plan, though, was persuading the hundreds of workers to take a 15 percent pay cut in return for a 50 percent share of any future profits. With the specter of a shutdown looming larger, the workers consented.
"There was a lot of trust," said Mr. Smith, the aluminum workers' president.
 
Turning a Shared Profit
The cost-cutting paid off handsomely. In the year ended July 1986, the first full year under Mr. Duker's management, Columbia Falls Aluminum went into the black. And according to court documents, the new owners honored their profit-sharing agreement to the letter, taking $1.3 million for themselves and distributing $1.3 million to the workers.
The next year, they also divided the profits almost 50-50 -- but with a twist that bothered Revo Somersille, the company's chief financial officer.
In 1986, the two partners in the closely held company had borrowed their projected share of the profits from Columbia Falls Aluminum's coffers and paid it back with interest. In 1987, they borrowed $6.5 million for the same reason, and again they repaid the money -- but this time, there was something missing.
"I asked them how much interest they were going to pay," Mr. Somersille said, "and they said there wasn't going to be any interest." That, Mr. Somersille thought, was unethical.
He would soon have even greater reservations about the owners' financial dealings. With costs plummeting and the price of aluminum soaring, the refinery's profits kept surging.
Yet in 1989, according to Mr. Somersille's deposition in the lawsuit, the owners deducted the company's Social Security taxes from the workers' share of the profits. In his view, that maneuver violated the profit-sharing agreement. "I indicated my displeasure," said Mr. Somersille, who now runs an accounting practice in Whitefish, Mont. Soon after, he said, he was moved to a nearly empty office with no duties to perform. Then he was dismissed -- because, he said, "I was making waves."
With his departure, accounting duties fell to Ms. Gilmore, the accounting supervisor. She had moved to Montana from Columbus, Ohio, in 1977 so she could spend her leisure time hiking, climbing and paddling her kayak across its wild landscapes. Starting out at the plant as one of several accountants, it was only a few years before she was in charge of more than a dozen people.
In March 1990, she said, company executives asked her to sign a letter to the accounting firm Ernst & Young, which was conducting a routine audit, saying that the company had no "contingent liabilities." She refused because, in her view, there were huge liabilities -- millions of dollars in profit-sharing money owed workers, she says she told her bosses.
"I knew I couldn't sign the letter, ethically, morally and legally," Ms. Gilmore said in an interview. Her employers were not pleased, instructing her, she said, "to keep my mouth shut."
Mr. Shipow, Mr. Duker's lawyer, said, "The company denies it did anything wrong or intimidated anyone." He also disputed employees' estimates of how much was owed to them, saying they did not take into account large sums that went to pay taxes on the profits. "When you consider all of the amounts we think should have been considered, the profit-sharing had been handled correctly," he said.
Then why settle for almost $100 million? "There's no such thing as a slam dunk," Mr. Shipow replied. "Instead of trying the case, moving on to make a lot more money for everyone seemed to be the way to go."
A court brief filed by the defendants in May 1996 sheds additional light on their thinking. In that document, Mr. Duker and Mr. Broussard complained that the employees took words and phrases out of context. Though the ARCO letter, for instance, stated that employees should "have a claim against at least 50 percent of the profits earned in each year," the partners' brief said that "Webster's dictionary makes it clear that a 'claim' is just a claim and not a right." The brief also characterized the phrase, "a dollar for me, a dollar for you," as "the alleged statements made by Brack Duker."
According to Ms. Gilmore, the admonition from her bosses kept her silent -- and the company without a completed audit -- for two years. But by 1992, she says, her frustration grew as profit-sharing distributions to the workers stopped. So Ms. Gilmore turned for help to an old friend and fellow outdoors enthusiast, a small-town lawyer named Roger Sullivan.
Ms. Gilmore first met Mr. Sullivan in the late 1970's, when she and her husband built a cabin deep in the Montana woods a short walk from one where Mr. Sullivan lived with his wife. He was a lawyer at the firm of McGarvey, Heberling, Sullivan & McGarvey in Kalispell, 20 miles from Columbia Falls. The firm specializes in environmental law but also handles an assortment of cases typical of a small-town practice, from workers' compensation claims to land condemnations.
Mr. Sullivan recommended that she take legal action, and on Sept. 24, 1992, she filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of herself and salaried workers at the plant. (Hourly workers would enter the suit later, through Powers & Lewis, a firm in Washington that specializes in labor law.)
The next morning, Ms. Gilmore reported to work as usual at 6:30. "At 6:40, I was surrounded by managers," she said. "They escorted me out the door like I was a criminal." Eventually, she said, most of the people in the accounting department lost their jobs and their activities were moved to Los Angeles, where Mr. Duker has his office.
 
A Long, Twisting Legal Road
Placed on paid leave, Ms. Gilmore started a kayak outfitting business and worked on the lawsuit with Mr. Sullivan and one of his partners, Allan McGarvey. She found herself shunned by many of her fellow workers, who feared that the trouble she was causing might lead to the closing of the plant.
In August 1993, Ms. Gilmore was dismissed. She quickly sued the company, contending wrongful discharge -- and Columbia Falls Aluminum just as quickly filed a counterclaim, contending breach of confidentiality.
Mr. Sullivan and Mr. McGarvey, meanwhile, started what would become an arduous five-year discovery process to gain access to the company's financial records. What they ultimately unearthed astounded them.
In the first three years of the profit-sharing plan, payments had been at near parity, with the owners receiving $29.2 million and the workers $27.3 million. Because the agreement allowed the owners to deduct capital investments from the workers' share, the disparity was not surprising.
But then, a huge gap opened. Mr. Duker and Mr. Broussard allotted $43 million to themselves in the final five months of 1988, a transitional period to a calendar financial year, and gave workers just $14 million. In 1989 through 1991, they distributed $159 million to themselves but only $43 million to workers.
In all, the workers had ended up with $84 million over five years, compared with the owners' $231 million. In the same period, only $7.5 million had gone to capital investments.
According to court documents, Mr. Duker's legal justification for the lopsided apportionment was that there was no official profit-sharing contract, only a one-page attachment to the union contract.
"The board of directors of the Columbia Falls Aluminum Company will determine each year the amount of profits available for distribution," the attachment read. "Fifty percent of the distributable profits as determined by the parent company will be distributed to employees."
That might seem clear enough, but in 1990, Mr. Duker filed an amendment to the company's pension plan, where many employees were putting their profit-sharing money, contending that the attachment was an "inoperative document." There was no binding contract, the amendment asserted, and profit-sharing allocations were at the sole discretion of the employer.
Two years later, court documents showed, Mr. Duker informed employees that he would no longer make any profit-sharing payments to them.
The plaintiffs' lawyers argued that the attachment was binding. And they bolstered their contention with some powerful ammunition. As the legal battle unfolded, worker after worker testified in depositions that after taking control of the plant, Mr. Duker had attended several meetings with employees to pitch his profit-sharing plan. And each time, they said, he had repeated the same phrase: "A dollar in your pocket is a dollar in mine."
 
A Letter and a Ruling
The lawsuit dragged along slowly for the first couple of years. Then, in a visit to ARCO headquarters in Los Angeles in 1995, Mr. Sullivan and Mr. McGarvey struck gold. They found the letter that the company had written to Mr. Duker, setting the condition that employees should have a claim to 50 percent of all profits.
As a result, the judge in the case ruled that a profit-sharing contract indeed existed and was binding on the owners. But how much money beyond their fair share, the lawyers now wondered, had Mr. Duker and Mr. Broussard awarded to themselves? And had they stashed it somewhere?
The beginning of an answer to both questions arrived in the law firm's mail a few months later from an anonymous source. It was a one-page memo from the files of Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian company that bought much of Columbia Falls Aluminum's production. Executives at Norsk were worried, the memo said, that they were being forced to "enter into a contract with an 'empty' company in the Cayman Islands."
Further investigation by the two lawyers revealed that Mr. Duker had created a shell company in the Caymans called Eural to receive the profits from the refinery rather than recording them on the American company's books, where they would be subject to claims by the workers. Mr. Shipow, Mr. Duker's lawyer, said recently that Eural was set up "because, given all the instability at the company, potential customers were not willing to take the risk of dealing with the company."
"They wanted to deal with the shareholders," he said. "It was done, we think, above board."
Based on that memo, the lawyers went to Federal court in September 1995 and asked Judge Jack D. Shanstrom to place the assets of Columbia Falls Aluminum in receivership. Mr. Duker and Mr. Broussard were subpoenaed for a hearing, Mr. Sullivan said, but in a courthouse-steps agreement, the two men agreed to put the company's stock under Federal court jurisdiction and to suspend all profit-sharing payments. They also proposed a $12 million settlement of the lawsuits, taking out a full-page ad in the local newspaper urging the workers to accept it. The deal was rejected overwhelmingly.
Two months later, in November 1995, the union contract at Columbia Falls Aluminum was up for renegotiation. Mr. Duker wanted to eliminate any mention of profit-sharing, and company officials again trotted out the threats of closing the plant. They also hired a private security force that had worked for coal companies during violent strikes in Appalachia in the 1980's. The 18 guards wore uniforms and berets and carried surveillance cameras. In small-town Montana, the message was clear, said Mr. Smith, the union leader: "If we went out on strike, it was going to be hardball."
To that stick, Mr. Duker added a carrot: He would reinstate the wages that had been reduced in 1985. Facing the prospect of a long strike they could end up losing, the workers agreed to his terms.
 
A Settlement for Christmas
By 1997, after years of frustration and a contempt citation for Mr. Duker for failing to produce financial documents, the plaintiffs' lawyers finally had received the bulk of the partners' personal financial records. According to court documents, the lawyers learned that a great deal of money earned by the company had been transferred to the personal accounts of Mr. Duker and Mr. Broussard in offshore bank accounts on the Isle of Man and Gibraltar. (Mr. Shipow, Mr. Duker's lawyer, said the accounts were set up as trusts for the two owners' families "as part of estate planning.")
All this was heady stuff for the Montana lawyers, who estimate that in the course of the legal battle, they dealt with 30 to 40 opposing lawyers, including luminaries like Joe Giroir of the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark., where Hillary Rodham Clinton was once a partner. To pay expenses, they were forced to take out an $850,000 bank loan. "We personally guaranteed payment," Mr. Sullivan said. "Our wives had to sign also. My wife literally cried."
That spring, Mr. Duker raised the settlement offer to $50 million. Again, the workers voted no.
Last December, Mr. Sullivan and Mr. McGarvey moved to a hotel in Missoula to prepare for a Jan. 3 trial date. The proceedings were scheduled to last two months, and hundreds of witnesses had been summoned to appear. Five days before Christmas, at a mandatory settlement conference, Mr. Duker raised the offer again, to $97 million.
This time, the workers accepted, by a 4-to-1 ratio. The two lawyers will get more than $6 million of the $32 million share received by salaried employees. The union lawyers will receive 10 percent of the $65 million awarded to hourly employees. The remaining $84 million is being split by roughly 1,000 workers and former workers: The average amount to union members employed throughout the profit-sharing period is $100,000, while salaried employees with similar tenure will receive about $150,000.
Columbia Falls Aluminum, in its written statement, said that the settlement, combined with previous profit-sharing disbursements, made its employees "among the highest paid -- if not the highest paid -- workers in the aluminum industry."
In recent weeks, numerous newspapers and television news programs have reported on how they will spend the money. Little has been said about how they got it.
For her role in the affair, Ms. Gilmore, known as Bobbie, has become something of a heroine in Columbia Falls. In 1996, signs proclaiming "Bobbie for Governor" sprouted at the aluminum plant. "There's no question there was tremendous heroism on her part," said Mr. Somersille, the ousted chief financial officer.
There is a bitter tinge, however, to the sweetness of victory for Ms. Gilmore. The aluminum company had rehired her in 1995, albeit in a job with less responsibility than she once held. When the class-action lawsuit was settled, she dropped her wrongful dismissal complaint against the company in return for an undisclosed award, and it dropped its breach-of-confidentiality suit.
But today, Ms. Gilmore is on medical leave for stomach problems caused by stress. "It's awkward," she said, working for a company that she feels conducted psychological war against her.
Mr. Duker's headaches are not over, either. In a lawsuit filed last month in Federal court in Missoula, one of his lawyers, Douglas Wold, contends that Mr. Duker refused to pay him a promised bonus of $3 million for holding the final settlement to $100 million or less.
Mr. Wold did not return phone calls. But Mr. Shipow said: "We think he has no claim. We are fighting the complaint vigorously."

Chart: "The Paper Trail To a Settlement"
It was after a company accountant, Roberta Gilmore, and her small-town lawyers unearthed documents confirming a profit-sharing pledge and offshore banking transfers that the owners of the Columbia Falls Aluminum Company agreed to a $97 million legal settlement with their workers.
 
1. In 1992, two years after she was asked to sign off on an audit she considered incomplete, Ms. Gilmore sued the owners over profit-sharing payments she said were owed to workers.
 
2. Searching files at Atlantic Richfield, former owner of the refinery, her lawyers found a document in 1995 spelling out the profit-sharing arrangement.
 
3. Sent anonymously, an internal memo from the Norwegian firm that bought the refinery's aluminum led Ms. Gilmore's lawyers to a Caribbean shell company to which the profits had been directed.
 
4. In September 1995, the owners, Brack W. Duker and Jerome Broussard,
ran a newspaper ad promoting their offer of a $12.1 million settlement
of the dispute. Workers rejected the deal.
 
5. Just before Christmas -- and the scheduled trial -- the owners raised their offer to $97 million. This time, the workers accepted; some will get hundreds of thousands of dollars.

HEADLINE: LOOPHOLE ON GUNS FEARED IN EUROPE

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Despite United States laws intended to curb international trafficking in firearms, the Clinton Administration has discovered that Washington has virtually no control over where American weapons end up once they are shipped to Europe, American and European officials say.
As a result, law enforcement officials in Europe and the United States say, thousands of high-powered and semi-automatic American pistols and rifles sold to Europe in the last few years have ended up fueling violent conflicts in places that include Rwanda, the countries that once were part of Yugoslavia, Algeria and Turkey, and in the hands of street criminals and organized crime syndicates. There are also indications that American firearms have found their way to Iraq and Iran. 
 As a first step to address the problem, the State Department is on the verge of revoking all outstanding licenses for firearms exports to British companies, a senior American official said.
Currently, 250 licenses are outstanding, for more than 14,000 handguns, according to American officials and a report from the American Embassy here to Washington in March.
Clinton Administration officials, who are making a major effort to stem the illicit movement of firearms, say they discovered the "European Union loophole" as they call it, during negotiations this year over a treaty to regulate the import and export of firearms.
The United States will present its proposals in May in Birmingham, England, at the summit meeting of leading industrial countries, the so-called Group of 7, plus Russia.
After meetings here in January and March of the G-7's subgroup on firearms, the Embassy reported in a message to Washington that the United States "should be concerned that firearms are not remaining in the countries for which they are licensed." The Embassy said that "a basic cornerstone" of United States policy "appears not to be supported by E.U. policy," referring to the European Union.
Asked why they had not discovered the problem until now, one senior American official said the United States had focused on third world, nondemocratic governments, never thinking there would be problems with NATO allies.
American law requires foreign purchasers of firearms and military equipment to sign a statement that they will not re-export the items without the authorization of the State Department, which issues the export licenses.
Under European Union law, however, there is no requirement that a company wishing to re-export goods to another member country notify the export authority in the original country, the Embassy reported.
Thus, an executive with Borchers, one of the largest gun importers in Spain, said he could re-export weapons bought in the United States to another of the European Union's 15 member countries without any approval from the United States.
The view of the European Union is that Washington's re-export restrictions are an infringement on "territorial sovereignty," as European officials put it.
"We object to anybody putting conditions on U.K. companies," said Steve Williams, an official in Britain's Department of Trade and Industry. He and other British officials said British companies were advised they could ignore the law.
One of the United States' major concerns is that firearms originally sold to a country like Britain are then sold to European Union countries like Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece. These countries have long sea borders that are difficult to police, and the authorities in these countries have acknowledged that historically well-developed networks smuggle everything from cigarettes to basic consumer goods and guns.
One British company, Conjay Arms, bought 1,600 handguns in February from an American company and sought the necessary export license. The application came just a few weeks before one of the toughest handgun control laws in the world went into effect here, barring just about every private citizen from owning a handgun.
Given the timing of Conjay's license request, American officials concluded that the guns were almost certainly not going to remain in Britain. Their British counterparts agreed but said there was nothing they could do, American officials said.
Conjay Arms, a major arms trading company, would not answer any questions about the transaction and demanded to know how a reporter had learned about it. "It's supposed to be confidential," said Gordon Conway, a company officer.
The Clinton Administration is also considering whether to revoke the pending licenses to all European Union companies. A major concern is Germany, for which there are valid licenses for 84,399 handguns, as well as France, with 22,660, and Italy, with 18,803, according to the Embassy report. It was provided to The New York Times by an American official who says that the Clinton Administration or Congress should act on the problem and that an international treaty to control firearms trade is needed.
Weapons from Italy and France have ended up in Bosnia and in North and Central Africa, American and European law enforcement officials say.
An American official in Germany said it was almost certain that most American guns sold to Germany do not remain there, given the country's tough gun control laws.
Eastern European governments have complained about firearms from Germany being smuggled to criminal gangs in their countries, and the Turkish Army has seized handguns from Kurdish guerrillas that Turkish authorities say have been smuggled from Germany.
Handgun shipments from the United States to German companies often do not even officially enter Germany. Instead they arrive by ship at ports in Hamburg or Bremenhaven, where they are immediately loaded onto another ship for another destination.
Germany does not require a license for the re-export of weapons shipments like this that are only in transit. Nor does any other European Union country, said Donald Manross, a senior American official in the firearms and explosives unit of Interpol, the international police agency, in Lyons, France.
The regulation of these transshipments is critical to keeping weapons out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and guerrilla groups, said Mr. Manross, who added, "It's not just a European problem, it's a global problem."
He said it is also necessary for European countries to register and mark imported weapons, something Western Hemisphere countries will begin doing under a treaty signed last year.
Nongovernmental organizations say there is also a need for greater openness.
The State Department submits an annual report to Congress on commercial sales of weapons and military equipment, broken down country by country. But it gives only the total number of weapons licensed, in each of 21 categories. The Department will not divulge further information, like the sellers and buyers, saying this is confidential business information.
European Union countries are even less forthcoming with information about weapons transactions.
In Britain, the Department of Trade and Industry gives only the number of licenses and by broad categories. There is no way of knowing how many weapons are covered by a license, which could be 1 or 1,000.
"There is a total lack of transparency, an inability to get to the bottom of anything," said Geraldine O'Callaghan, an arms trade analyst at the British American Security Information Council, a nongovernmental arms control organization with offices in London and Washington. "Even a member of Parliament cannot find out who bought or sold what."
In the last two years, Britain has licensed the export of small arms to several countries to which the State Department has denied such licenses, usually on human rights grounds. These include Indonesia, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Zambia and Colombia.
At the top of the list of recipients of small arms licenses from Britain in the last two years are the United Arab Emirates (65 licenses), Oman (49) and Qatar (20). These small countries on the Persian Gulf are well-known centers for smuggling operations into Iraq and Iran; boats cross the water loaded with everything from soup to guns.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 6, 1998, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 19 about the export of American-made weapons to Europe, and about Washington's concerns that it cannot monitor where they ultimately go, referred incorrectly to activities of a British company, Conjay Arms. According to Gordon Conway, an officer of the company, it has imported 72 firearms from the United States this year and has sought to import another 90. It did not purchase 1,600 handguns in the United States in February and apply for a license to export them.
A license to export 1,300 handguns to Britain was sought by an American company on behalf of Conjay in February. But Mr. Conway said that while it is routine in his business to apply for a large license, his company did not intend to buy or import that many handguns. Mr. Conway said his company imports weapons into Britain for resale to licensed dealers in that country and never exports them to other countries.

HEADLINE: NBC Offers Video Clips From New Web Service

BYLINE: By LISA NAPOLI 

 BODY:
Jay Leno monologues, interviews with "Friends" stars and archival clips from the "Saturday Night Live" vault -- all with a few clicks of the mouse.
Those are among the offerings on a new World Wide Web service that NBC plans to announce this week in an effort to capitalize on a growing interest by consumers and advertisers in video on the Web. 
 The service, which is called Videoseeker and will go on line Wednesday at http://www.videoseeker.com, will also include music videos and entertainment news from NBC's syndicated series "Access Hollywood."
At the debut, hundreds of clips, each several minutes long and catalogued in a searchable data base, will be available in a variety of formats, with more to be added on a continuing basis, a Videoseeker spokesman said. NBC executives said the new service was meant to demonstrate the ways the Web could be used to enhance the business of broadcasting rather than to obliterate it.
"We don't want to replace television," said Martin J. Yudkovitz, president of NBC Interactive, the network's new-media division. "That's not possible. There will always be television, and there will always be an Internet. Neither will ever be the same once they begin to invade each other's space. That's what's happening now as this convergence occurs."
Though the service will be free, users will be asked to register when they first visit the Web site, allowing NBC to aim on-line ads at individuals based on their interests and demographic profiles. Doing so would enable the traditional broadcast network, in essence, to narrowcast and to resell existing programming -- same product, different medium.
NBC intends to take full advantage of the Web's interactive capabilities.
"It supports our transactional philosophy," Mr. Yudkovitz said. "If we wanted to sell a videocassette, this is a perfect way to do that. It's not about making shows available on demand. It's about making our services available on demand."
That, analysts said, has broad implications for the way viewers consume television.
"Inherent in the concept of a monologue repurposed for a new medium is a different theory for how consumers will get entertainment," said Mark Hardy, a new-media analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "You really start to stretch the bounds of, 'O.K., how much can I make on an entertainment property?' "
The longer-term implication, Mr. Hardy said, is that broadcasters can reach their audiences by parceling out programming. "Since it's self-service," he said, "your audience can come to you at any time, and you can serve it up in any increment that works."
Though many cable networks offer video clips on their Web sites, including NBC's MSNBC cable channel, most of it has been news-oriented. And none of the big three broadcast networks has excerpted programming on line in this sort of format.
"This is a very compelling consumer proposition," Jeremy Verba, the president of E! Online, which offers video excerpts from the cable channel E! Entertainment Television. "If you believe the Internet as a medium is moving toward a more video-based medium, those that have video assets have a tremendous competitive advantage going forward."

HEADLINE: MEDIA: PUBLISHING;
Looking through Pulitzer-colored glasses: Disasters and crime reign supreme.

BYLINE: By Felicity Barringer 

 BODY:
SEEN through the lens of the Pulitzer Prizes, Clark Kent is a superman. He needs no phone booths. It is not the spandex suit with the big red "S" that makes the man, it is the notebook, the smarts, the guts and the heart.
Long before slogans became sound bites, journalists had developed their own verbal shorthand for what they did and why: Comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. Be a watchdog. Write the first rough draft of history. 
 The board that gives out journalism's highest awards, named for the publisher Joseph Pulitzer, has since 1917 set out to honor extraordinary examples of reporting, capturing the spirit of these sound bites. (The letters awards, for books, drama and music, are a subject for a different sort of analysis.) The sum total of what the board has done over the last 30 years shows that the profession is more likely to honor those who worry about afflictions than anything else.
And so to look at the journalism Pulitzers over the last three decades or so is not necessarily to look at the world the journalists have lived in. To look at the list of recent Pulitzer Prizes is to see the profession that prides itself on shrewdness, savvy and dispassionate analysis looking at itself with a downright romantic eye.
There is, of course, a caveat. As Louis D. Boccardi, president and chief executive of The Associated Press, said, "I don't know if you can draw sociological significance from the prizes, beyond the fact that in any particular case, really good people were put on a big, overwhelming story."
So let it be stipulated: Pulitzer winners have done extraordinary work. But in what arenas do journalists prefer to work?
First and foremost, arenas of affliction. Disasters and their causes and cures are the centerpiece of the Pulitzer oeuvre. Articles about the Detroit race riots, the Kent State shootings, Three Mile Island, the Challenger space shuttle explosion, the Los Angeles riots, the World Trade Center bombing and the crash of T.W.A. Flight 800 have all been honored with Pulitzers.
When reporters could do something to explain the causes of disasters or help alleviate the pain they caused, they sometimes won Pulitzer gold medals for public service for their newspapers, as The Grand Forks Herald in North Dakota did last week for coverage "that helped hold a community together" after last year's devastating floods.
"We're pro-disaster," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, the legendary former editor of The Washington Post who now serves as a vice president of the Washington Post Company and was a member of the Pulitzer Prize board for several years.
Comforting the afflicted leads journalists to examine prisons and mental hospitals, and four times since 1966, the board has honored work showing that someone had been falsely convicted of a crime.
A second strong tendency has been to reward watchdogs: Newspapers win prizes for unearthing corruption, abuse of power, callousness or mismanagement in the public or not-for-profit sectors, whether among the Philadelphia police, in the municipality of Stamford, Conn., in a transit system or in an evangelical ministry.
But what about corporations and industries? Are there some comfortable folk there who could do with some afflicting? Not many, by the Pulitzer scoreboard. More than 250 Pulitzers in journalism have been awarded since 1978. Business figures prominently in about 10.
So, while Pulitzer Prize entries have chronicled the 1987 stock-market crash and the finagling that went on afterward, corruption in grain exporting, an attempted foreign takeover of an American tire company and the management woes of General Motors, the awards indicate that a corrupt municipal government gets more scrutiny than a corrupt brokerage house does.
By the same yardstick, journalists do better when they examine the nuances of human disease and environmental destruction than when they tackle the workings of the economy or the rise of personal computers.
The assumption has built-in problems for Mr. Boccardi, who has seen the process from a board's-eye view and a juror's. "We don't sit there and deliberate and say that we ought to be encouraging stories about Glass-Steagall because it's going to be really important come the new global economy," he said, referring to the law separating commercial and investment banking.
Each year's entries, he said, are measured only on their own merits. "I've never heard anyone say, 'We went with a war story last year, let's look for something else this year,' " he added.
Coverage that counts as the first rough draft of history has gotten its share of awards: the Vietnam War, the Pentagon Papers, Watergate, school desegregation, the fall of Communism, the crumbling of apartheid in South Africa, the twists and turns of the Middle East all produced award-winning coverage.
Latin America? Before this year's award for articles on drugs and corruption in Mexico, just three prizes for dispatches from the region since 1968. Africa? Three from South Africa since 1968; three more from sub-Saharan Africa, two on famine and the most recent for reporting on the rise of the Ebola virus in Zaire.
But the political and social conflicts of the Southern Hemisphere are mostly not the stuff of Pulitzer-Prize analysis. Seen through the Pulitzer lens, they are the stuff of emotional imagery: Since 1975, more Pulitzer-winning coverage in Africa and Central America has been done by photographers than by writers.
A simple explanation is that the phtographers drawn to Africa do superb work. Less flattering is the notion that journalists are better at making readers feel the pain of those countries than at explaining it.
Award-winning journalism, then, is a Superman sort of thing. It fights for truth and justice. But explosions and crime are journalists' business; glaciers are for historians.
"You have to remember," said Seymour Topping, the administrator of the Pulitzer board, "very often in economics and politics there isn't much of an opportunity to dramatize."

HEADLINE: Terry Sanford, Early Foe of Bias as Governor, Dies at 80

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
Terry Sanford, who lowered racial barriers as Governor of North Carolina in the 1960's, setting the style for a new kind of Southern politician, and later became a United States senator and Presidential candidate, died today at his home in Durham, N.C. He was 80.
The cause was complications from cancer, said Duke University, where Mr. Sanford was treated and where he was president from 1969 to 1985. 
 Until his cancer was diagnosed in December, Mr. Sanford had taught government and public policy at Duke and practiced law. He was president of the university, in Durham, after serving as Governor and before his term in the Senate.
Mr. Sanford is credited with helping to improve education in North Carolina, first as Governor by increasing spending for public schools and universities and later as president of Duke by overseeing its expansion in areas including medicine.
Mr. Sanford was at various times a lawyer, a member of the North Carolina State Senate, from 1953 to 1955, and, in the early 1940's, an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Mr. Sanford was Governor from 1961 to 1965, a time when civil rights demonstrations were frequently met with violence. In a speech on Jan. 18, 1963, he called for an end to job discrimination against blacks and announced the creation of a biracial panel to work toward that end.
"Despite great progress, the Negro's opportunity to obtain a good job has not been achieved in most places across the country," Mr. Sanford said. Opening more opportunities would be good for the state's economy, he said, but there was a far more compelling reason. "We will do it because it is honest and fair for us to give all men and women their best chance in life," he said.
By today's standards, those words seem unremarkable. But in January 1963, when Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama delivered his "segregation forever" inaugural address, Mr. Sanford's stand for civil rights was seen as particularly courageous for a governor from the old Confederacy.
Mr. Sanford established himself as one of the most liberal Southern governors -- too liberal, in the eyes of some constituents -- as he named black people to high state positions, pushed state lawmakers to raise more money for schools and started a state anti-poverty program that was a forerunner to President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty.
In some ways, Mr. Sanford was a contradictory politician. He seemed to have good timing but bad luck. He had shrewd instincts, yet he seemed to lack burning desire. His changes of mind and heart confounded ally and rival alike.
Mr. Sanford was an early supporter of John F. Kennedy's quest for the Presidency, and so enjoyed easy access to the White House in the early 1960's. The President's personal secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, later wrote in a book that President Kennedy had told her he was thinking of Mr. Sanford as his running mate for 1964.
His own liberal programs notwithstanding, Mr. Sanford preached the virtues of "state responsibility," if not states' rights, as an antidote to creeping "big Federal Government." Under state law, he could not succeed himself as Governor.
He tried for the White House in 1972 and in 1976, while he was president of Duke University, offering himself as a candidate for those disenchanted with the political system and those who were part of it.
Mr. Sanford, who had declared his support for school integration, was beaten in the 1972 North Carolina Democratic Primary by Governor Wallace of Alabama. That humiliating loss effectively ended his candidacy. Four years later, Mr. Sanford ran for President again but dropped out early. He said he had found it impossible to gain enough news coverage and to raise enough money, and that he was sick of campaigning.
In 1986, having left Duke, Mr. Sanford ran for the Senate. When President Ronald Reagan made several appearances on behalf of his opponent, Mr. Sanford knew better than to criticize a popular President. So he suggested instead that North Carolina did not need a "go-along senator," and won a narrow victory.
In the Senate, Mr. Sanford gained a reputation for intelligence, personal decency and, in one celebrated instance, indecision. In 1987, after President Reagan had vetoed an $87.9 billion highway bill, Mr. Sanford changed his mind three times: first voting simply "present" on a vote to override the veto, then voting to sustain the veto and finally, under tremendous pressure from other Democrats, switching again and voting to override it. His vote made the count 67 to 33, the precise margin required to override.
"Nobody in the Senate thinks I caved in," he said later. In fact, his colleagues on both sides of the aisle were saddened at seeing him buckle.
In 1992, Mr. Sanford appeared at first to be in good position for re-election, but he was hospitalized with a heart problem during the campaign. His opponent, Lauch Faircloth, a former Democrat and onetime friend, tried to tar him with the brush of liberalism. And Mr. Faircloth deftly made an issue of Mr. Sanford's health by publicly wishing him a speedy recovery.
Mr. Faircloth's narrow victory ended Mr. Sanford's political life, one that had begun when he was 11: in a 1928 parade in his hometown, Laurinburg, N.C., Terry Sanford carried a sign for Alfred E. Smith, the Democratic Presidential candidate.
Terry Sanford was born on Aug. 20, 1917. His father was a merchant and his mother a schoolteacher.
He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1939. After a brief stint in the F.B.I., he joined the Army in 1942. That year, he married Margaret Knight of Hopkinsville, Ky.
Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Terry Jr., of Durham; a daughter, Elizabeth, of Hillsborough; two sisters, Mary Glenn Rose of Pennsylvania, and Helen Wilhelm of Bern, Switzerland, and two grandchildren.
As an Army private, Mr. Sanford served as a paratrooper, taking part in the invasion of Southern France and later in the Battle of the Bulge, for which he received the Bronze Star and a Purple Heart.
After the war, mustering out as a first lieutenant, he received his law degree from the Chapel Hill campus and became active in the North Carolina Democratic Party.
Whether working for himself or on behalf of other Democrats, he was known as a tireless campaigner, and a cool one. While he was running for governor, the pilot of his small plane seriously misjudged a short landing strip and came within inches of touching down in a cornfield.
Unruffled, Mr. Sanford stepped out and, grinning, helped several ashen reporters down the steps.
"Start picking corn, boys," he said before walking away.

HEADLINE: No. 1 on Beijing's Most-Wanted List

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 19

 BODY:
Well before the student democracy movement of 1989 gained world attention with protests in Tiananmen Square, Wang Dan, a thin, intense history student, had become known as a brave thinker on the Beijing University campus for organizing "democracy salons" where political alternatives were freely discussed.
Then, as the movement quickened, he organized an unofficial student union, a direct challenge to Communist control. When students first marched into the square in the center of Beijing, he quickly emerged as one of a handful of leaders and remained one of the most respected. 
 Many Chinese remember being impressed by his sincerity when, days into a hunger strike, wan and feeble, he was among the student leaders who had an angry meeting with Prime Minister Li Peng on national television.
With the army crackdown on June 3-4, Mr. Wang escaped arrest for several weeks. When the Government issued its list of the most-wanted dissidents, he was ranked No. 1. He fled to the south, then returned to Beijing and that July was captured and sentenced to four years for counterrevolutionary propaganda.
When he was paroled in February 1993, he said he had two goals: to be readmitted as a student at Beijing University and to continue working for democracy.
The university would not take him back, but his work for democracy continued despite intense police harassment. In a typical article, written for a Hong Kong newspaper in 1995, he described the growing economic insecurity felt by workers as the Government began reforms of state industries, reforms that have since resulted in tens of millions of layoffs.
"The Chinese Government could reduce the chances of all this leading to social unrest by allowing political reforms that would give the public a chance to express its dissatisfaction through democratic channels," he wrote.
Mr. Wang was arrested again in May 1995 and held for 17 months before a trial, at which he was found guilty of conspiring to subvert the state and sentenced to 11 years.
The prosecutor detailed his crimes. For instance, Mr. Wang was accused of falsely claiming, in articles published in Taiwan and Hong Kong, that "freedom of speech under the Constitution has become an empty phrase" and was said to have "slandered the Chinese Communist Party" by referring to its members as "a lost and confused generation."
Also cited were his communications and meetings with other democracy advocates, his efforts to raise money for released political prisoners, and even his enrollment in a correspondence course at the University of California.
In in an open letter to the National People's Congress, written in March 1994, Mr. Wang wrote, "I believe that what I am doing is just and conforms with the three requirements I set for myself when I was discharged from prison in February 1993: not letting down the people, not letting down history and not letting down my own conscience."
Now, from exile, he will have to find new ways to pursue his goals.

HEADLINE: Undergraduate Education Is Lacking, Report Finds

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
The acclaimed research universities of the United States are shortchanging their undergraduate students, particularly freshmen, according to an unusually candid report from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, one of the nation's leading education-policy organizations.
It said universities consigned undergraduates to classes taught by graduate assistants and failed to provide students with "a coherent body of knowledge" by the time they graduated. 
 The report, by a commission whose members included officials of research universities, says there is a longstanding division between research and teaching that should be ended and that universities should involve undergraduates in research -- whether in medical laboratories or humanities projects -- beginning in the freshman year. The report is being released today.
"What we need to do is to create a culture of inquirers, rather than a culture of receivers," said Shirley Strum Kenny, the president of the State University of New York at Stony Brook and chairwoman of the 11-member commission that wrote the report, "Reinventing Undergraduate Education: A Blueprint for America's Research Universities."
The report describes the situation for undergraduates in stark terms: "Too often the freshman curriculum is a bore and freshman instruction inadequate. Senior professors, when they teach undergraduates, tend to teach majors in advanced courses." It added: "As a result, freshmen -- the students who need the very best teaching -- may actually receive the worst."
Robert Diamond, director of the Institute for Change in Higher Education at Syracuse University, who saw an early draft, applauded its recommendation for linking education and research more closely.
"It makes a lot of sense pedagogically and from the standpoint of serving the community," he said. "Learning will be improved. Students will have a better sense of how faculty work and think. And it relates the classroom to the real world."
The accusation that research universities fail their undergraduates by putting research ahead of teaching was a constant theme of Ernest L. Boyer, the former president of the Carnegie Foundation, who established the commission shortly before his death in 1995.
The commission argues that the nation's 125 research universities have as important a role in education as in research, since they grant nearly a third of the baccalaureate degrees though they represent only 3 percent of colleges and universities. "To an overwhelming degree, they have furnished the cultural, intellectual, economic and political leadership of the nation," the report said.
The universities covered in the report emphasize graduate education and research and receive significant Federal research money. They range from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Kent State University.
Many of the report's proposals are familiar -- rewarding faculty members more for good teaching, using technology more creatively and fostering more interdisciplinary work -- but the commission tried to weave them into a plan to transform undergraduate education, and it offered examples of model programs.
The report also makes a variety of other recommendations, including placing freshmen in small groups where they live together and take courses together. At Duke University, for example, freshmen sign up for interdisciplinary programs in which they take two related seminars and a related writing course. Enrollment is limited to 30 students who are also grouped together in a dormitory.
Another proposal calls for getting students involved in research with senior faculty members. At the M.I.T., more than half of the undergraduates earn academic credit or hourly wages for work on research projects that they propose or that their professors are conducting.
Still another recommendation is that students be required to conduct original research that could become their transition into graduate school. Princeton undergraduates are required to conduct independent research or creative work in their junior year, which becomes the basis for their senior thesis.
The report says oral and written communication should be emphasized in all classes. The University of Iowa recruits graduate instructors for required courses in communications and research from all departments.
The commission also called for the universities to structure courses around research and problem solving. In one Harvard course in introductory physics, students record their answers to conceptual questions on computers in class. Then they meet in small groups to discuss their answers with one another, before the instructor discusses the responses.
Dr. Kenny said that although some of the suggested changes could be costly, the National Science Foundation and other groups that finance research are beginning to require that undergraduate students be involved in projects they finance.
For all the problems at research universities, the report said that they have the potential to offer "a virtually matchless education," with their world-class faculties, high graduation rates, strong support for the arts, interdisciplinary programs and commitment to diversity.
The report will be available on the Internet at http://www.sunysb.edu/ boyerreport.
Besides Dr. Kenny, these are the members of the commission:
Bruce Alberts, president of the National Academy of Sciences;
Wayne C. Booth, professor emeritus of English and rhetoric at the University of Chicago.
Milton Glaser, a designer and graphic artist.
Charles E. Glassick, senior associate at the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
Stanley O. Ikenberry, president of the American Council on Education.
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.
Robert M. O'Neil, director of the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression and professor of law at the University of Virginia.
Carolynn Reid-Wallace, senior vice president for education and programming at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting;
Chang-Lin Tien, chancellor emeritus and N.E.C. Distinguished Professor of Engineering at the University of California at Berkeley;

HEADLINE: As Top Dissident Lands in U.S., China Is Hoping to Score Points

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 19

 BODY:
Wang Dan, a leader of the 1989 Tiananmen democracy movement, entered freedom, and exile, in the United States today, in a move the Chinese Government clearly hopes will score points with the Clinton Administration.
Mr. Wang's release from prison had been repeatedly requested by Washington as a tangible sign of progress on the sticky issue of human rights and it comes two months before President Clinton's planned visit to China. The American and Chinese Governments both say they want to cement a "strategic partnership," building closer economic and political ties despite differences over trade and human rights. 
 The Chinese Government said that Mr. Wang, who was serving an 11-year sentence on charges of conspiring to subvert the state, was freed on medical parole. After arriving in Detroit today, Mr. Wang was hospitalized for medical evaluation but said he expected to hold a news conference in New York on Thursday. Page A6.
A White House spokesman with President Clinton's entourage at a meeting in Chile of hemisphere leaders, Eric Rubin, said today of Mr. Wang's release, "This is something we have been urging them to do for quite some time."
Rights advocates in China and elsewhere, while welcoming Mr. Wang's release, worried that it could lead to a reduction in international pressure for systemic change in China, where open opponents of Communist rule are readily imprisoned, often without trial or public attention.
With Mr. Wang's departure and the similar release into exile last November of another famous democracy advocate, Wei Jingsheng, none among the thousands who are still jailed here for peaceful political or religious dissent is well known to the outside world.
"We must be clear: this is not a release, it's a forced exile," said Han Dongfang, a labor activist who was jailed after 1989; he now lives in Hong Kong and is barred from returning to the Chinese mainland. "It has become clear to every Chinese that if you want to criticize the Government you have two choices: you can go to jail, or go out of the country," he said in an interview.
Mr. Wang, 29, was sentenced to prison in 1996 for his persistent, probing writing about democracy and the failings of Communist rule and for his contacts with exiled dissidents. He previously was imprisoned from 1989 to 1993.
Officially, he was freed today on medical parole to seek treatment abroad. But the release reflected a political calculation by Chinese leaders, who have become adept at using well-known prisoners as diplomatic bargaining chips.
Mr. Wang, a wiry, boyish-looking intellectual who to many symbolized the moral authority of the 1989 student-led democracy movement, had been imprisoned in the northeastern province of Liaoning. His parents and especially his mother, Wang Lingyun, worked tirelessly and in the face of official threats to keep his case in the public eye. She has reported that he has persistent throat infections, prostate problems and headaches.
Like Mr. Wei, who was released on medical parole soon after President Jiang Zemin's visit to the United States last fall, Mr. Wang was flown to Detroit, where the only direct flight from Beijing to the eastern United States lands. After his medical condition has been assessed, he may join colleagues in New York, according to Xiao Qiang, executive director of Human Rights in China, who was among those greeting him in Detroit.
Chinese democracy advocates here and abroad stressed that China continues to harass and imprison thousands of peaceful dissenters on matters of politics and religion. They also worried that with the only internationally famous prisoners both in exile, outside pressure for change could wane.
"After these two releases, I'm worried that many people won't care about all the other active dissidents," said another 1989 activist, Lu Siqing, by telephone from Hong Kong. "People just seem to care about the famous ones."
By the Government's own count, some 2,000 people remain imprisoned for the crime of "counterrevolution," a category eliminated in legal changes last year. While records are not public, rights advocates believe that thousands more political, labor or religious dissidents are serving terms of up to three years without trial or have been sentenced to jail on trumped-up nonpolitical charges like "hooliganism" or economic crimes.
Recently, the Government has forced some troublesome individuals out of the country. And several dissidents have chosen exile over the threat of jail or a life of harassment and unemployment.
Although rights advocates abroad are increasingly using E-mail and the Internet to spread their messages inside China, the Government seems to be gambling that prominent opponents will have less impact as exiles than as famous prisoners.
In the case of Mr. Wei, the gamble seems to have paid off, so far at least. While he has been an irritant since his release, lecturing governments not to be fooled by cosmetic changes in China, the United States, Europe and Japan seem intent on forging closer economic and political ties with China, a huge, increasingly assertive power. American officials have vowed they will continue to press concerns about human rights.
Mr. Wang had said he would not leave China unless he was assured he could return. But in recent months, his mother has told reporters, as his health worsened and after passing two bleak winters in prison, he relented.
Following his capture in a manhunt in 1989 -- after tanks and troops had crushed the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds -- Mr. Wang served a prison term of three and a half years.
On his release in 1993, in the face of constant surveillance and several brief detentions, he continued writing about the merits of democracy and the problems of China, publishing articles in Hong Kong and abroad and trading ideas and strategy with fellow democracy advocates inside and outside China.
In early 1995 he wrote, "A society still needs idealists -- people who are willing to sacrifice themselves to uphold the basic ideals of freedom and democracy."
Arrested again in May 1995, he was held without trial for 17 months. Then, in a four-hour trial, he was convicted of subversion and given a sentence of 11 years.
American officials say they have been pressing for the release of other prisoners as well. These may include Gao Yu, a journalist who, after disclosing unannounced national budget figures in a Hong Kong newspaper in 1993, was given a six-year sentence for divulging state secrets.
Another often-mentioned prisoner is Liu Nianchung, a labor and civil rights advocate who was arrested in 1995 and sentenced to three years in a labor camp. Despite reports of poor health, his term was extended because he refused to sign a confession.
Among the more notable religious prisoners is a 75-year-old Catholic bishop, Zeng Jingmu, who spent 23 years in prison after the Communist takeover in 1949 because he refused to bow to the state-sponsored church, and in November 1995 received another three-year sentence for holding unauthorized religious services.
"The press tends to build up one name among the dissidents, and others of the same importance and with even longer sentences aren't noticed," said Mr. Xiao, of Human Rights in China, a group based in New York.
Today, to emphasize the point, his group released a list of more than 150 people who were arrested soon after the 1989 demonstrations and are still in prison today, largely forgotten by the outside world.
The list was mainly compiled by Li Hai, who previously served a one-year sentence for his role in the 1989 protests. For assembling this list of prisoners, he was sent back to prison in 1989 for a nine-year term, for divulging state secrets.

HEADLINE: FREE-TRADE ZONE OF THE AMERICAS GIVEN A GO-AHEAD

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, April 19

 BODY:
Leaders of 34 countries in the Western Hemisphere took a first step today toward creating the world's largest free-trade zone, one that would span the Americas.
In a joint declaration signed by President Clinton and 21 other presidents and 12 prime ministers, the leaders said that talks on the subject would begin in September and they pledged to make "concrete progress" toward a goal of signing an agreement by 2005. 
 But reaching a final agreement is by no means certain, mainly because of strong opposition in the United States Congress, which has so far failed to grant Mr. Clinton the so-called fast-track negotiating authority that is considered crucial to reaching a hemispheric free-trade accord.
For that reason, the leaders here attending the second Summit of the Americas focused much of their attention this weekend not on free trade but on improving social conditions in the region.
As part of their final communique, the leaders agreed to a sweeping social action plan that is intended to improve education, reduce poverty, expand democracy, guarantee human rights and fight drug trafficking in the hemisphere.
"We all admit that too many of our citizens have not yet seen their own lives improved as a result of our participation as free nations in a global economy," Mr. Clinton said at the meeting's closing ceremony at the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"We have, therefore, committed ourselves here to a second stage of reforms designed to bring the benefits of freedom and free enterprise to ordinary citizens throughout the Americas."
Human rights groups, which have long criticized free-trade agreements as failing to address social needs, applauded the social action plan while questioning whether it would be enforced once the leaders leave Santiago.
"This is the silver lining to Clinton's failure to get fast track -- a shift away from trade to human issues," said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division of Humans Rights Watch.
"As a matter of principle, this social action plan is wonderful because it addresses the grave social ills and abuses of power that these governments have long ignored. In practical terms, however, this type of rhetoric often doesn't result in any action because there's no mechanism for accountability."
Education is at the center of the plan, which calls for all governments in the region to provide universal access to elementary school education by 2010 and to provide high school education for 75 percent of the region's youngsters by the same year.
"Education is the determining factor for political, social, cultural, and economic development of our peoples," the communique says. "In order to meet our goals within the agreed time frames, we affirm our commitment to invest greater resources in this important area."
Under the plan, the region will have access to $8.3 billion in new loans and grants, mainly from the international lending organizations. The money would be used for a variety of programs, including a number that would improve teaching, and to buy textbooks and other materials.
As part of the plan, the leaders also promised to lower barriers to home ownership, strengthen democratic institutions, improve training for judges and prosecutors and cooperate in the fight against drugs.
Thomas L. McLarty, President Clinton's special adviser for Latin America, said in an interview that the social action plan was the next logical step for Latin America as it completes a first round of reforms, which have included a return to democracy in many countries and a restructuring of inefficient economies.
Perhaps the most discussed issue of the social action plan was its creation of the position of rapporteur, or monitor, at the Organization of America States to report on freedom of expression. The rapporteur would investigate cases of press repression and other free-speech abuses.
Despite the rise of democracy in Latin America after decades of military dictatorship, freedom of the press remains a goal rather than a reality across much of the region. Often those opposed to free speech are the democratically elected governments promising to protect it.
In the last decade, at least 120 journalists have been killed in Latin America while reporting on corruption, drugs and human rights abuses. Several Latin American governments, like Argentina's, have introduced legislation that critics contend would intimidate the press and quash investigations.
In Latin America, the press is often the only check on government. In many of the countries, the executive branch exercises considerable control over the judiciary and the legislature, which are often dominated by members of the President's party or by the President's appointees.
Clinton Administration officials have long expressed concern about making new trade deals with countries that do not have independent news organizations to help guard against corruption. That concern has been echoed by those involved with international business and investment.
While the meeting focused less on trade issues than the organizers had hoped, trade experts said setting a date to begin free-trade talks and establishing a logistical framework for those negotiations would hopefully keep the momentum for an agreement alive.
But the experts acknowledged that the lack of fast-track authority -- under which Congress would be able to approve or reject a trade agreement negotiated by the Administration but not to amend it -- had hurt the United States' credibility on free trade.
The Free Trade Area of the Americas would have 34 member nations (Cuba is not included)with 750 million people and a gross domestic product of more than $9 trillion. The United States accounts for 85 percent of the region's economy.
The population would be more than double the 370 million of the 15-nation European Union.
Last year, United States exports to the hemisphere totaled $286 billion, or 42 percent of its global exports. In the five years since 1992, trade within the Western Hemisphere has risen to $592 billion, from $375 billion.

Going Bankrupt to Get a College Education

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES 

 BODY:
This spring, more than two million high school seniors will scan their acceptance letters one last time and decide on a college. Students with stellar transcripts and S.A.T. scores are rolling in scholarships, thanks to a heated competition among elite colleges to attract the hottest freshmen. But young people who fall outside the elite group will find the welcome -- as measured in student aid -- considerably cooler.
The luckiest students can pay burdensome tuition without scholarships. Less lucky are the poor and middle-class students who make up the majority of enrollment. Two-thirds will risk academic failure by working at paying jobs 25 hours a week. This entering class will finish college with more loan debt than any in history. 
 Voter outrage about soaring costs and debt has prompted Congress to raise Federal tuition aid ever so slightly this year, after letting it plummet since the 1970's. At the state level, political pressure has forced lawmakers in New York and California to restore some aid to university systems that were systematically starved beginning in the late 70's. But with the children of the baby boomers due soon at the state university door, the Federal and state governments have yet to reverse the destructive policies that drove up tuition costs and forced many students to skip college.
Education debt was always a fact of life for doctors, lawyers, dentists and M.B.A.'s, who pay full freight on the theory that they will earn a great deal afterward. But soaring tuition and declining Federal grants have made extensive borrowing commonplace for undergraduates as well.
Stories about this problem generally focus on the elite universities, where total costs have exceeded $30,000 a year. Princeton, Yale and Stanford recently refashioned aid packages to provide relief for middle-class families. But the most serious problems are found in the four-year public colleges that educate close to 80 percent of all college students. A recent study from the General Accounting Office found that tuition at four-year public colleges rose by 234 percent between 1980 and 1995, far faster than household income, tuition at private colleges or health care costs.
Public college students showed the largest increase in borrowing, with 60 percent needing loans in 1996, up by almost a third from just three years earlier. The percentage of college graduates who owed $20,000 or more doubled to 19 percent. These students are steering away from public-service jobs like teaching, which pay too little. Fearful of debt, minority students are putting off advanced degrees, stalling upward mobility for their ethnic groups.
Pressured by constituents, Congress set up the National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education. The commission's report missed the fact that Federal and state governments had drastically rewritten education policy without public debate. It focused instead on red herrings like the cost of Government paperwork and the expense of maintaining tenured faculties.
Soaring tuition at state institutions is a double-edged problem. After the states cut back on subsidies, students were forced to pick up more of the cost. Meanwhile, the Government quietly changed the student aid formula, substituting loans for Government grants and work-study programs. The Federal Pell grant program was devastated. In 1974, Pell grants covered more than 80 percent of the cost of attending a four-year state college for the poorest students. In 1996, the grant covered less than 40 percent.
The United States has historically assumed that an educated population was a benefit to the society as a whole. But this view was undermined by the 80's idea that only individuals benefit from an advanced degree -- and should find the money for it themselves. The country already has millions of people who are uneducated and unemployable. Unless we re-evaluate educational funding, we could find ourselves with many millions more.

HEADLINE: As Beaches Erode, a Debate On Who'll Pay For Repairs

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

 BODY:
From the East End of Long Island to the southern tip of New Jersey, these are jittery times for the owners of billions of dollars' worth of shorefront homes and businesses.
Two howling northeasters in midwinter destroyed a $750,000 beachfront home in Southampton, N.Y., and damaged a half-dozen others, flooded and tore up a major highway leading north from Sea Isle City, N.J., to the mainland and devoured old dunes shielding homes on the barrier islands of both states. 
 Already feeling vulnerable to an angry sea, coastal residents this year face a battle on another front. The Federal Government, which shorefront residents have always considered their savior, is balking at playing a major financial role in the restoration of beaches.
With more people building closer than ever to the water's edge, the problem of erosion has become a serious one. And with more property in danger, a debate is growing over who should pay for rebuilding eroded beaches, or whether they should be rebuilt at all.
For the Federal fiscal year starting Oct. 1, the Office of Management and Budget has earmarked $3.7 million for the Army Corps of Engineers to rebuild beaches in New Jersey and on Long Island. Coastal business owners and local officials and their allies on Capitol Hill want $50.6 million to continue existing beach projects and to study the need for new ones.
President Clinton has tried since 1995 to cut Federal spending on such projects, but each time Congress has restored the money and the White House has acquiesced.
This year, White House officials have suggested that they may not be as accommodating. A senior White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Clinton may use line-item vetoes on some projects if Congress again restores full financing. The line-item veto was recently struck down by a Federal court, but the Administration has appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.
But the debate is over more than money. The issue is how much of an obligation the nation has to protect homes and businesses on coastlines. Critics ask whether the Federal Government should be rebuilding storm-damaged beaches, and if so, how much it should spend on the task.
Many environmentalists have long denounced beach rebuilding as a boondoggle for the beachfront elite, saying it is simply throwing taxpayers' dollars into the ocean. Coastal interests chafe at that contention, insisting that rebuilt beaches are crucial to the safety of beachfront homes and highways, and are necessary for the tourist industry.
Last month, White House budget officials, environmental experts and representatives of coastal states met to look for common ground in their dispute, but participants said the meeting failed to produce any.
The Army Corps of Engineers has been rebuilding beaches since the 1950's. Through 1995, the bulk of those projects were in North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and California. The Corps had been planning to continue work on one of its most ambitious projects: spending $15 million next year to pump sand from the ocean bottom onto about 10 of the 21 miles of beach from Sandy Hook to Manasquan, N.J.
It had also been planning to spend an additional $5 million on smaller projects or on planning for the other 100 miles of the state's coastline. The Clinton Administration wants to spend just $3.5 million in the state next year.
Long Island, too, faces the prospect of major Federal cuts -- to $200,000 proposed by the Administration, from the $30.5 million coastal officials had sought for two projects affecting about 10 miles of beaches.
Advocates of beach replenishment see it as critical for the region's future.
"People's lives and property are at stake," said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey. "Jersey's beaches bring crucial tourist dollars to the state."
But James Tripp, the general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, said rebuilt beaches would not protect all coastal buildings in major storms. "Pumping all the sand in the world is not going to save the day," he said. He wants to make it more difficult to rebuild storm-damaged buildings, saying that such structures are vulnerable to future damage.
"If property owners want the Federal Government to moderate erosion, there has to be a contractual understanding that property is going to be lost and not rebuilt," he said. "We'll have to retreat."
Currently, the Federal Government pays 65 percent of the cost of beach rebuilding projects, covering both the initial sand pumping and, after storms erode rebuilt beaches, new rounds of pumping every 5 or 6 years over 50 years. States and local governments usually split the other 35 percent.
The White House does not object to continuing to pay two-thirds of the cost of the initial pumping. But the senior White House official said the Administration would like to see the states pay 65 percent of the cost of the later pumping, with the Federal Government picking up the other 35 percent.
If beachfront economic benefits are so important locally, the official said, then coastal states should pay a greater share to protect them.
 
Development Edges Closer to the Ocean
Until relatively recently, erosion was not as significant a problem as it is now because fewer people were building on the coast. But in the last few decades, development has edged closer to the ocean, and doing nothing to stem erosion is no longer a viable option in most places, shorefront property owners and their legislators contend.
That is why Stone Harbor, N.J., which lost a protective dune in front of five blocks of homes this winter, plans to spend $2 million of its own money to rebuild the dune and the beach in front of it, rather than wait for a Corps of Engineers beach project that is now uncertain.
That is also why some shorefront residents of Southampton, where damage to housing was the region's worst this winter, want the freedom to erect bulkheads or rocky walls, called revetments, in front of their homes. Town officials have proposed a six-month moratorium on granting permits for construction while they draft a long-range beach protection plan.
The Corps of Engineers, meanwhile, is studying how to protect the biggest single stretch of Long Island's barrier islands -- the 83 miles from Fire Island east to Montauk Point.
The Corps's studies for this region date from the early 1960's, but final plans will not be ready until at least 2002 because the Federal Council on Environmental Quality has asked for detailed reviews of the impact of sand pumping on wildlife and on water quality in the bays north of the barrier islands, officials say. Various disputes have impeded planning, which was suspended from 1983 to 1993 because New York State balked at helping to finance it.
 
Devising Ways To Pay for Projects
Many Fire Islanders say they need their beaches rebuilt sooner than early in the next century. The Corps of Engineers has drafted a $60 million sand-pumping project for a 12-mile stretch of the island. But the Federal Department of the Interior objected to the project two months ago, complaining that it would start before completion of the intensive 83-mile coastal study and could have a negative impact on the nearby Fire Island National Seashore.
Gerard Stoddard, president of the Fire Island Association, says a majority of island residents are willing to tax themselves up to $4 million to pay half of Suffolk County's $8 million share of the proposed project. But, state officials say, Suffolk officials are looking askance at the idea because of county concerns that it would be unable to collect Fire Island's $4 million if, by chance, a major storm were to destroy Fire Island homes.
Suffolk, officials said, wants Albany to create a special erosion-control authority to collect Fire Island's taxes and absorb the financial liability if its residents fail to pay.
Some coastal legislators in Trenton see a need for New Jersey to provide more money for beach rebuilding. These state legislators want to add $10 million to the annual $15 million fund created in 1992 to help pay New Jersey's share of the Army Corps's beach rebuilding projects. But passage of the increase hinges on the ability of coastal lawmakers to overcome the traditional reluctance of non-shore legislators to commit state tax dollars to beach rebuilding.
Officials in Avalon, N.J., a wealthy coastal community south of Atlantic City, agree that it is time for shore towns to spend more on erosion control. Since 1987, Avalon has spent about $8.6 million in local tax dollars to replenish its five-mile beach after storms, Harry DeButts, Avalon's public works director, said. "It's hard for me to listen to other people cry wolf and stand idly by waiting for someone else to save them," he said.
Besides paying for its own beaches, Avalon is one of the few New Jersey coastal towns that has not squeezed housing into just about every square foot of beach property. In 1968, Avalon bought hundreds of acres of beachfront to create a buffer up to 500 feet wide between its dunes and its first row of homes, Mr. DeButts said.
 
New Methods Of Shore Protection
In recent beach projects in the region, the Corps of Engineers has forsaken broad use of the rocky groins commonplace for decades on the New Jersey Shore and Long Island.
Critics say the groins and their longer sister structures, jetties, tend to trap sand moving in currents running parallel to the shore and dam it on one side of the structure, creating a fat beach there and a skinny, sand-starved beach on the other side. To eliminate that, the Corps has started removing sections of rock from some groins on New Jersey's shore so sand can flow more freely.
Joseph Vietri, deputy chief of planning in the Corps's Manhattan office, said groins are no longer considered environmentally sound. "I like the idea of softer solutions," he said. "That's definitely the way we're going. Structures are a choice of last resort. The first thing we look at is good old-fashioned sand."
New Jersey's chief coastal engineer, Bernard Moore, agreed that broad beaches are a coastal town's best line of defense against storms, now that the technology exists to pump sand to the shore. "Seawalls and bulkheads just don't cut the mustard," Mr. Moore said. "They're the last line of defense."
While last winter's storms eroded many New Jersey beaches, including those built up by the Corps near Sandy Hook and Ocean City, the beach at Barnegat Light at the north end of Long Beach Island gained sand. It is on the southern side of a jetty at Barnegat Inlet. The jetty has trapped so much sand drifting north in the currents running parallel to the coastline that Barnegat Light homes, once at ocean's edge, are now nearly a mile from the water. Some residents now call the beach the Sahara, and the Mayor, Kirk Larson, plans to provide a tractor-pulled flatbed to haul people from their former seaside homes and save them a long walk over hot sand.
The region's biggest debacle involving man-made structures began near Westhampton in the 1960's, when the Corps began a major groin-building project. Currents in the area generally carry sand from east to west, and the idea was to start building the groins from west to east, thereby distributing sand more evenly among the various beaches.
Instead, bowing to pressure from property owners on the east end of the project, the Corps started building the groins in the east. That cut off sand that otherwise would have moved along the stretch of beach to the west. The beaches on the western end became starved for sand, and when a major storm hit in December 1992, Atlantic Ocean waters sliced through the narrow barrier island at Westhampton.
About 190 of the 246 homes on the island were destroyed before the Corps of Engineers, in an emergency $32 million project, filled the breach, and later widened the beach.
In an out-of-court settlement of a Federal lawsuit, the state promised residents of the community, now called West Hampton Dunes, an unconditional permit to rebuild the lost homes. But the piping plover, an endangered shore bird, is threatening a delay. The Federal Fish and Wildlife Service has told Albany that it risks violating the Federal Endangered Species Act if it allows construction in a known plover habitat during the bird's nesting season, from April 1 to June 30.
The Mayor of the town, Gary Vegliante, is angry. "They're trying to devalue the entire property," he said of the Fish and Wildlife Service.
Sherry W. Morgan, field supervisor of the Fish and Wildlife Service's regional office in Cortland, N.Y., replied, "We're not out there saying there should be no people on any of these beaches." The service's only goal, she said, was to protect the endangered plover by delaying construction until after its nesting period ends.
Steve Jones, director of Suffolk County's Planning Commission, condemned the whole notion of spending millions in taxpayers' dollars in West Hampton Dunes to rebuild the beach and the dunes, allowing people to rebuild their homes. Mr. Jones said it was folly to subsidize rebuilding in a place vulnerable to destruction. "The Federal Government allowed people to be foolish," he said.

Chart/Map: "From Montauk to Cape May: The State of the Beaches"
This winter's storms, though not the most devastating of the decade, caused significant beach erosion and damage to houses and businesses along parts of the Long Island and New Jersey coasts.
In the past, the Army Corps of Engineers and some beach towns might have tried to prevent further damage by building sea walls or rocky groins or their longer sister structures, jetties. But those structures have proved to be, at best, ineffective, or even harmful.
The Corps now favors softer solutions, like pumping sand from the ocean bottom onto eroded beaches.
But some towns have tried other approaches to protecting their oceanfront. Sea Isle City, for instance, is installing a tube filled with sand along 12 blocks of dunes. In Margate, a school class planted a wall of Christmas trees.
 
LONG ISLAND
 
Endangered species
Construction that might interfere with the piping plover, an endangered shore bird found along the 83-mile stretch from Fire Island to Montauk Point, could be delayed until June 30, the end of the bird's nesting season.
 
Fire Island
The Corps of Engineers has drafted a $60 million sand-pumping plan for 12 miles of beach. Status: delayed by environmental concerns and cost-sharing disputes.
 
Long Beach Island
Sand-pumping projects planned for a 9-mile stretch of beach that includes Lido Beach, Point Lookout, and the City of Long Beach. Status: financing uncertain.
 
Southampton
Property owners are pressing for the right to construct bulkheads or other hard structures to protect their own beachfront land.
 
The beach at West Hampton Dunes
In the 1970's the Corps installed 15 groins from east to west -- backward, as it turned out -- from West Hampton to Moriches Inlet. Ocean currents run predominantly east to west along Long Island's south shore. As each new groin was added, sand carried by the current was prevented from reaching beaches to the west. Those beaches gradually narrowed until a storm in 1992 cut through the island.
 The Repair -- Sand was pumped onto the beach to fill and widen the breached area, and the groins nearest the inlet were shortened, so more sand could flow past and reach the eroded beach.
 
Total cost to repair the breach: $32 million
State and local share: $11 million
Federal share: $21 million
 
NEW JERSEY
 
The trouble with sea walls
In the long run, sea walls, like the one at Sea Bright, can do more harm than good. Wave energy is deflected, not absorbed, when it strikes a hard surface, so the force is simply redirected -- energy deflected downward can scour away sand under a wall. And storm waves that wash around seawalls erode property at either end.
 
Jetties keep an inlet clear . . .
. . . but for the town below, it means a long hike to the beach. There are two jetties at Barnegat Inlet, which are intended to keep the channel free of sand. The southern one, at the top of Long Beach Island, has trapped so much sand that the beach there has widened to about three-fourths of a mile. Christmas trees
 
Christmas Trees
A fourth-grade class in Margate has planted discarded Christmas trees along the beach as an experiment in erosion control.
 
A sand dune in a tube
A 12-block stretch of beach along Sea Isle City's main highway was severely eroded last winter, eliminating the dune beside the only north evacuation route off the island. A geotube, a huge fabric tube pumped full of wet sand, was installed on the beach along Ocean Highway from First to 12th Streets, creating a temporary barrier. The tube, which cost $500,000, was paid for with city funds.
 
What it costs to save a beach . . .
The cost of sand pumping and groin construction by the Corps of Engineers from 1994 to the present, from Sandy Hook, N.J., to Barnegat Inlet: $94.8 million.
 
. . . and who pays for it
State and local governments have paid 35 percent of the total: $33.2 million The Federal Government has paid 65 percent: $61.6 million

HEADLINE: Banking on Congress

 BODY:
It was nervy of Citicorp and Travelers to announce the biggest merger in corporate history even though current Federal law would prevent the deal from being carried out in full. Both institutions exuded confidence that Congress would change the Depression-era banking laws that prevent banks, insurance companies and investment bankers from entering one another's turf. This page has long supported such a change. But their confidence also tells a sad story of how reliably money buys influence and preferential treatment in Congress.
In the 1996 election cycle, the various pieces of the conglomerate that is to become Citigroup made $2.6 million in campaign contributions to Congressional candidates and political parties, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the current cycle, the sum is already $1.3 million. In all, the financial sector is the biggest single contributor of money to the political system. Altogether, the finance, insurance and real estate sector has given $48.3 million since the 1996 election. 
 Much of this money went to members of the House and Senate banking committees, which oversee financial-sector deregulation issues. Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, chairman of the House Banking Committee, has an admirable record of refusing contributions from political-action committees and out-of-state residents. His Senate counterpart, Alfonse D'Amato of New York, is one of the biggest fund-raisers in Washington from companies his committee oversees.
So far, all this money has produced mostly gridlock. The most recent attempt to modernize financial laws crashed in the House last month in a storm of lobbying from all sides to gain an advantage. Though banks want some of the regulations lifted, they ended up lobbying against the bill on the ground that it gave too much benefit to rivals in the savings bank and insurance industries.
The House will try again to remove some of the antiquated barriers stifling competition in the financial-services industry. Mr. Leach has announced hearings on the most recent mergers to help give impetus to such legislation. It is thus more important than ever for the public to understand how campaign money corrupts the system. A study by two economists presented in 1996 said that a major factor in how members of Congress dealt with the issue was whether they received a preponderance of money from one line of business or another.
Modernizing the financial sector is one of the highest priorities facing Congress. It is also imperative for Congress to insure that campaign money does not talk louder than the public interest.

HEADLINE: Trauma Centers Short of Patients As New York's Crime Rate Drops

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
New York City's historic drop in violent crime may be good for New Yorkers, but it is proving troublesome for a costly, prestigious and highly competitive enterprise: treating victims of shootings, stabbings and other trauma.
Through the late 1980's and early 1990's, a steady stream of mugging, knifing and gunshot victims flowed into the city's hospitals, supplying much of the material for what became a $250-million-a-year business. City and state officials approved the creation of 17 "level one" trauma centers -- costly, up-to-date units that keep teams of elite surgeons and nurses on call to treat the most severe injuries. 
 But as the system grew, critics contended that New York's glut of hospitals and the medical industry's fierce territorialism were leading to the creation of too many centers. Now, critics say the drop in crime may place some of the trauma centers in jeopardy.
An analysis by The New York Times has found that the number of trauma victims -- typically victims of accidental falls, car accidents and gunfire -- dropped 20 percent citywide between 1993 and 1996. Although the number of car crash and fall victims remained roughly the same, the number of gunshot wound victims plummeted more than 50 percent.
Trauma surgeons say some centers that once handled a constant stream of life-and-death emergencies are now underworked. And aside from the cost of running the expensive units, some experts say, the shortage of patients could actually be compromising the level of care.
With too few patients, trauma surgeons who must execute complex, life-saving maneuvers at high speed are unable to keep their skills honed, said Dr. Marcel Martin, the outgoing director of Staten Island University Hospital's trauma center.
The lack of trauma patients, he said, forced him to use more cadavers to educate medical students. "This is totally stupid," Dr. Martin said. "I've never seen anything like it in my life."
The Times analysis also found that some of the city's least-busy trauma centers appear to be handling fewer than the minimum number of severely injured patients required by the state health code to maintain their designation.
The city's busiest trauma center, at Kings County Medical Center in Brooklyn, saw 1,600 cases in 1996, or roughly 4 a day, according to hospital figures. That was down almost 40 percent from the 2,600 cases in 1991. The number of patients at the trauma center of Lincoln Hospital, in the Bronx, dropped to 1,500 in 1996 from roughly 2,300 in 1993.
In Los Angeles and Chicago, by contrast, the majority of trauma patients are treated at a single workhorse center in each city. The Los Angeles County Medical Center handles more than 7,000 trauma cases a year, or more than 19 a day; Cook County Hospital in Chicago handles roughly 5,000 cases a year, or about 13 a day.
Experts say the original goal behind the introduction of trauma centers -- concentrating high-quality trauma specialists in a handful of regional facilities -- is being compromised in New York.
"You have too many pretenders in the system and it dilutes patient care," said Dr. David R. Boyd, who served as the Federal Government's Director for Emergency Medical Services from 1974 to 1982 and invented the trauma system concept. "They're wasting money and they're misrepresenting trauma care to the community."
But Dr. Arthur Cooper, a trauma surgeon at Harlem Hospital and vice chairman of the State Department of Health's Trauma Advisory Committee, said that although some studies showed that busier trauma centers performed better, others showed that being too busy can reduce the quality of care.
But what the minimum number of patients should be is the subject of debate. The Department of Health is currently not enforcing the minimum-volume standards it established in 1990, state officials said. The department, which was a world leader in showing that increased volume improved cardiac surgery care, is now using a trauma database it created in 1994 to study how volume affects trauma care.
"We're aware that a few hospitals in New York City and upstate are not making the minimum," said Frances Tarleton, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Health. "But we're not sure whether that has a negative impact on care or not."
 
State Won't Disclose Trauma Center Figures
Ms. Tarleton said that the state trauma database figures are private and that the state would not disclose which city trauma centers are not making the 1990 state minimum. But the Times analysis, based on publicly available admissions records, showed that the least busy trauma centers in the city are New York Hospital Queens, Harlem Hospital, St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital and St. Vincent's Medical Center of Richmond. Officials at those hospitals disputed The Times's figures or said the quality of care in their trauma centers was comparable to that of busier centers.
Dr. Rodger W. Yurt, a trauma surgeon at New York Cornell Medical Center and chairman of the city's Trauma Advisory Committee, said that New York's congested streets and high-rises -- which render helicopters impractical -- make it prudent to have more trauma centers per capita than elsewhere.
The 17 centers in the 5 boroughs serve a population of roughly 7.2 million; by comparison, 6 level-one centers serve the 9.1 million people in Los Angeles County.
New York's situation is not unique. A nationwide drop in the number of trauma patients -- at least partly fueled by increased use of air bags and seat belts -- is sparking debate in other cities, said Dr. David B. Hoyt, Director of Trauma at the University of San Diego Medical Center and chairman of the American College of Surgeons' Committee on Trauma.
Studies show that severely injured patients are more likely to survive if they reach a trauma center than if they are taken to a standard emergency room. But the resources required to open one are considerable.
Each trauma center must have a surgeon with at least five years of experience on duty at all times. A dozen specialized surgeons must also be on call, able to arrive within 30 minutes. And millions of dollars' worth of high-tech equipment must be available.
In an age of increasing competition and managed care, the stakes for hospitals are high. While expensive to operate, trauma centers can make money if they attract the right mix of patients. Even with the drop in trauma patients, New York hospitals billed more than $225 million for trauma care in 1996, according to the Times analysis.
The prestigious centers also help hospitals to attract top doctors and medical students and, equally important, patients who believe that the hospitals must be exceptional if they have trauma centers.
Dr. Harold Osborne, chairman of the city's Advisory Committee on Emergency Medicine and director of the emergency department at Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx from 1993 to 1997, said that marketing and ego too often play a role in hospitals' opening trauma centers.
"It's a question of cachet, reputation and status," he said. "Hospitals in the era of managed care are hustling to be recognized for excelling in any area. You have politics overcoming health-care economics and rational health-care planning."
Critics of New York's system say the clearest example of its excess is on Staten Island. Currently, if someone is critically injured in a car on an even-numbered day, paramedics will rush the person to St. Vincent's Hospital of Richmond. But if the accident is on an odd-numbered day, paramedics take the victim to Staten Island University Hospital.
The arrangement was approved by state and city health officials in the mid-1980's as part of a delicate compromise. Both hospitals desperately wanted level-one trauma centers. But there was a shortage of neurosurgeons and there were not enough serious trauma cases on Staten Island to justify two units.
Dr. James Coil, director of St. Vincent's Hospital of Richmond's trauma center, said the arrangement cut costs without decreasing the quality of care.
But Dr. Martin, the outgoing director of Staten Island University's trauma center, and trauma experts in other cities called the arrangement wasteful and potentially damaging to the quality of care.
Critics say the city's Trauma Center Advisory Committee, which consists of local trauma surgeons; the city Emergency Medical Service, and the State Department of Health have approved the creation of too many centers. They say that an outside agency, like the American College of Surgeons, should be involved.
Originally established as 10 trauma centers in 1984, the system grew to 15 by 1990. And over the past 18 months, two new pediatric level-one trauma centers were approved. Of the city's 17 centers, 10 are in private hospitals, including the 7 created since 1984.
But Dr. Alexander Kuehl, who established the city's trauma system as medical director of the Emergency Medical Service from 1981 to 1989, defended the current committee and New York's system. He pointed out that hospitals in other cities withdrew from trauma care when it became unprofitable for them.
"I truly am grateful that the hospitals have kept the resources there," he said.
Whether that will remain true remains to be seen. Trauma surgeons at several of New York's busiest centers said that patient volume is dropping or has reached a plateau. The change at Kings County has been the starkest. During the early 1990's, the hospital earned the grim distinction of having one of the country's busiest and best trauma centers for gunshot wounds.
"They used to say we saw more than most men who went through Vietnam," Dr. Lisa Patterson, the director of Kings County's trauma center, said somewhat wistfully. "I was on call this New Year's Eve and we had one case after midnight. That's it."
 
Top-Quality Care, But a Flawed System
Reflecting the opinion of most of the New York trauma surgeons interviewed, Dr. Patterson said the city's system provided top-quality care. But she agreed that there were flaws, asserting that too many trauma centers are in Manhattan and on Staten Island. Manhattan, with 1.5 million people, has 6 trauma centers, while Brooklyn, with 2.1 million people, has only 2 -- the same as Staten Island, which has only 395,000 people. As a result, many trauma patients from southern Brooklyn are transported to Staten Island for treatment.
Critics say that one of Staten Island's trauma centers should be eliminated. Meanwhile, Lutheran Hospital in southern Brooklyn plans to apply to open a trauma center, hospital officials said.
Some experts believe that economics may thin the ranks, even if regulators do not. In Miami, the high cost of trauma care led to the consolidation of six trauma centers in the late 1980's to one mammoth center. Chicago and Los Angeles also saw the number of trauma centers drop in the early 1990's.
Already, the drop in gunshot patients in New York is leading some hospitals that traditionally treated many such victims to encourage more distant ambulance services to bring them trauma patients.
Dr. Ronald Simon, director of trauma surgery at Jacobi Medical Center in the northeast Bronx, said his hospital is now welcoming patients from lower Westchester County. Trauma experts pointed out that Westchester trauma patients, many of them people with medical insurance who are in car accidents, can be more profitable than gunshot victims, who often have no insurance.
Dr. Simon predicted that increased competition would inevitably lead to fewer hospitals and fewer trauma centers. "I think with the changes in health care, some hospitals are going to survive and some aren't," he said. "In order to survive, you have to hustle."
But Dr. Unsup Kim, director of Elmhurst Hospital's trauma center, predicted that the system would remain essentially unchanged, given the city's concentration of prestigious medical schools and powerful hospitals, and the politics of the health-care industry.
"All the trauma centers have affiliations with large institutions," he said. "I don't see it happening in New York."

HEADLINE: Man Beat Ex-Girlfriend to Death With a Tree Branch, Police Say

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
Three days after being ordered by a judge to stay away from his longtime girlfriend, a Brooklyn man returned to the apartment they had shared and beat her to death with a tree limb, prosecutors said yesterday.
The man, Samuel Tolliver, 56, returned to the apartment in the Van Dyck Houses on Sutter Avenue in Brownsville on Friday to pack up his belongings, the authorities said. He was in violation of a court order to stay away from his former girlfriend, Karen Chambers, 45, Sabrina Schwartzwald, a spokeswoman for the Brooklyn District Attorney, said. 
 Mr. Tolliver took some personal effects, but witnesses told the police that he and Ms. Chambers quarreled over other property. Mr. Tolliver stormed out, carrying a few plastic bags.
A short time later, residents of the project heard the couple shouting in the lobby. Ms. Chambers began screaming and Mr. Tolliver pummeled her across the head with a tree branch he had picked up outside, Ms. Schwartzwald said. Neighbors called the police, who found Ms. Chambers dead, face up in the lobby.
Mr. Tolliver was arraigned last night on two counts of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon. He was held without bail and is to return to court on Friday, Ms. Schwartzwald said.
Mr. Tolliver and Ms. Chambers had two children, a 9-year-old boy and a 7-year-old girl, neighbors said.
Mr. Tolliver had three convictions for assaulting Ms. Chambers, and on the last occasion, Ms. Chambers had asked the court to issue an order of protection against him. The order was granted on April 14, said Officer Valerie St. Rose, a police spokeswoman.
Residents described Mr. Tolliver as an unemployed man who spent the afternoons drinking on the grounds of the housing complex. They said the abuse had gone on for many years. "It's a terrible thing," Benedita Distance said. "He was a drinker. He pushed a cart around collecting bottles. I didn't want anything to do with him. He looked dangerous."

HEADLINE: On High-Tech Jobs: More Training, Not Quotas;
New Visa Policy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The solution to the problems with immigration visas for foreign investors cited in your April 13 front-page article is not the creation of new Immigration and Naturalization Service regulations but in a full overhaul of the law. 
 The current threshold requirement of an investment of at least $500,000 in high unemployment areas that creates or saves jobs is too high to attract a significant number of foreign investors. Congress should lower the amount to $100,000. Congress should also direct the I.N.S. to collect the money from foreign applicants directly and to use the fund to help reduce the huge backlog of pending cases clogging the system.

HEADLINE: Use of Work Visas by Technology Companies Is Under Fire

BYLINE: By JERI CLAUSING 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19

 BODY:
As the information technology industry lobbies Congress to let more high-skilled foreign workers enter the country, new immigration figures indicate that the companies applying for the most visas are using them for the kind of jobs that critics say many Americans could easily be trained to perform.
Figures recently given to Congress by the Immigration and Naturalization Service show that the 10 companies using the most visas last year all provide contract labor and services -- jobs like computer and software installation and maintenance that critics contend do not necessarily require college-level math and science degrees. 
 The designation H1-B is used for work visas intended for hard-to-fill jobs. Many technology companies say they need to import more workers under the H1-B program because of a shortage of technically proficient domestic workers to fill crucial electrical engineering and product development jobs -- positions that often require master's or even doctorate degrees.
And yet, the company that imported the most foreign labor last year under the H1-B program is the Mastech Systems Corporation, a Pittsburgh company that received visas for 1,733 employees -- or about 80 percent of its domestic work force -- to bring in software programmers with only bachelor's degrees.
"This is not brain surgery," Representative Ron Klink, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said of the jobs being filled by foreign workers at companies like Mastech. "These jobs do require some skill and intellect. But American workers can be trained to take these jobs."
Mr. Klink, a member of the House Commerce Committee, requested a recent General Accounting Office review that questioned the extent of the shortage of technology workers.
He and other critics want Congress to hold the line on the number of visas rather than adopt a proposal by Senator Spencer Abraham, a Michigan Republican, that would raise the number of H1-B visas to 95,000 from 65,000. American industry, they argue, is exaggerating the dearth of qualified labor market to import foreign workers who are willing to work for lower pay and who take jobs from Americans.
Supporters of the Abraham bill, which is scheduled for a Senate vote early next month, say the current ceiling will be reached in May, four months before the end of the Federal fiscal year and leaving many crucial technology projects at risk.
No comparable House legislation has yet been introduced. But the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on immigration is holding a hearing on Tuesday. And the chairman, Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, said he hoped to have a bill offered within a week and passed by the full House by the end of the month.
Industry lobbyists say the shortage of high-tech workers is so acute that failing to raise the cap could threaten one of the most vital parts of the nation's booming economy. Companies unable to fill crucial positions in this country, they say, will have no choice but to send more sophisticated technology projects overseas.
The American information technology industry has 346,000 job openings -- more than enough to go around for foreign workers and Americans alike, said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, a Washington trade group.
Complicating the debate are some seemingly contradictory trends, as some key parts of the industry -- including personal computer makers and chip companies -- are grappling with cyclical softening of their markets.
Two weeks ago, for example, the Intel Corporation played a lead role in releasing an industry study that contends there is a dire shortage of skilled technology workers. By last week, the company was announcing plans to cut some 3,000 jobs, mainly through attrition, in response to weakening demand for its microprocessors.
But the kinds of jobs going dark and the kinds going begging are not of the same skill level, according to Tracy Koon, an Intel spokeswoman. The company is always on the lookout for the type of highly skilled employees who receive most of its H1-B visas. At Intel, about 3 percent of a work force of 67,000 people have been hired via H1-B visas, and nearly 80 percent of the immigrants hold master's degrees or doctorates, Ms. Koon said.
Two other Silicon Valley advocates for the Senate bill, including the National Semiconductor Corporation and Varian Associates Inc., have frozen their work forces at current levels.
Varian Associates, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., is a maker of laboratory instruments, medical equipment and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. It has only 30 H1-B visa holders among its 7,000 employees and is not currently seeking to add any new high-skill positions. Nevertheless, Varian wants the immigration cap raised.
"We don't know when the crunch is going to come; it's so cyclical," said Ernest M. Felago, Varian's vice president of human resources. "Our only point is that it's another source of labor, so why dry it up?"
National Semiconductor, also a chip maker, said that 55 of the 450 technical people it has hired this year required H1-B visas. Even though the company has imposed a temporary hiring freeze, National Semiconductor, like Varian, wants the visa limit raised to be assured of having access to the best talent from where ever and whenever necessary.
"We would probably support taking the lid off altogether, but that's pretty radical at this point," said Tom Wulf, director of staffing for National Semiconductor.
A problem with even the current caps, according to companies which seek the highest-skilled foreign workers, is that too many of the H1-B visas are being used to fill jobs that do not require searching overseas for candidates.
"They should be hiring double-E people and people in product development," Mr. Wulf said, using an industry abbreviation for electrical engineers. "Otherwise," he said, they shouldn't be allowed to use the visas."
But Mastech, for one, makes no apologies for using the visas or for bringing in such a high proportion of immigrant labor. Mastech began as a high-tech personnel service but has expanded into helping companies design, install and update office computer systems.
"The whole market has grown so fast and the talent keeps declining," said Chuck Rusdill, investor relations director for Mastech. He said the company has been forced to dip into the foreign labor pool for even bachelor-degree holders, not to pay lower wages but because of the dwindling number of American computer science graduates.
Mastech said that most of its H1-B workers arrive with a bachelor's degree in computer science and three to five years of work experience. But Mr. Klink said that many of the jobs at Mastech and companies like it do not require math or science degrees. Programming, he contended is a skill that many underemployed Americans can easily be trained to do.
During the 1993 and 1994 votes on free-trade treaties, "we were being told that as we entered the new information age, our workers were going to be training for new information technology jobs," Mr. Klink said. "Now, only four years later, we're being told we don't have enough people, our people aren't trainable."
As the debate rages, even basic data are being questioned about the extent of the job opportunites in information technology. In addition to the the Information Technology Association of America study that found 346,000 job vacancies, the Commerce Department has estimated that the information technology industry will need an additional 1.3 million workers over the next decade.
But the recent General Accounting Office review questioned the validity of those numbers and the methods used for calculating them.
And while the industry points to figures showing wages in information technology are as much as 64 percent higher than the national average, critics say a rather modest wage growth in the field does not bear out claims of a labor crisis.
Norm Matloff, a computer science professor at the University of California-Davis, said that Norm Matloff said that Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate salaries for computer programmers rose 7 percent last year -- not a rate that would indicate employers are desperate for new labor, he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 29, 1998, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on April 20 about technology companies' hiring of foreign workers misstated the name of one company. It is the Mastech Corporation, not Mastech Systems. The article also misspelled the surname of the company's investor relations director. He is Chuck Rudisill, not Rusdill.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Who Uses High-Skill Visas"
Across the country, thousands of foreigners with special work visas, called H1-B visas, are working for technology companies that say they need the foreign labor to fill skilled jobs that cannot be filled by Americans. Some critics, though, contend that the workers are not necessarily more skilled, just less expensive. Chart lists companies with the largest number of these workers.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It seems everyone is happy that an individual who uses the muddy track around the Central Park Reservoir can come up with the $500,000 for the repairs (news article, April 16). 
 But what about mud, broken benches and other problems in parks in less affluent neighborhoods?
A modest proposal: pair up parks in affluent and poor neighborhoods. Money spent in one has to be matched in the other. Accept the $500,000 for Central Park only if $500,000 is available for a "sister park" in a neighborhood in need. Maybe that will begin to equalize available recreational areas in this increasingly economically divided city.

HEADLINE: In the Light of Dying Stars, Astronomers See Intimations Of Cosmic Immortality

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

DATELINE: MAUNA KEA, Hawaii

 BODY:
HIGH on the mountain, above the clouds and under a crescent moon, one of the world's two most powerful telescopes was aimed at stars exploding halfway across the universe. The night was not going well. At one point fog had shut down operations, and roiling winds sometimes blurred vision. An electronics glitch erased some precious data and cost time.
Scientists were hunched before computer screens in a control room at the base of the mountain, anxiously waiting for an encouraging word from telescope operators up in the dome at Keck Observatory here. "This is ulcer time," said Dr. Robert A. Knop, one of the astronomers, as he reached for another handful of corn chips. "You get the feeling the universe is trying to prevent us from discovering the truth." 
 There was nothing Dr. Saul Perlmutter could do but fidget and muster reserves of patience. An astrophysicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, he is the leader of one of the two rival groups racing to extract from exploding stars, or supernovas, a fundamental characteristic of the expanding universe.
"Projects like this must be the ultimate in delayed gratification," he mused. "You work 10 years developing a technique. You have to pull through problem after problem like this, and it's a year and a half after you first see a result before you can say you know something new about the universe. Then something wakes you up, and you realize that all this nitty-gritty stuff has to do with big philosophical questions."
Like the nature and fate of the universe.
For much of this century, ever since Edwin P. Hubble discovered in 1929 that the universe is expanding, scientists have not only theorized about how it all began in the Big Bang, but also how it will end: whether the universe will collapse of its own weight in a Big Crunch, slow its expansion to a state of equilibrium or keep expanding forever into an ever darker, more tenuous infinity. But their long quest to back up theories with definitive observations has until now frustrated the best astronomers.
Finally, the two teams believe that they are closing in on the answer. Recent observations by Dr. Perlmutter's team and another one, led by Dr. Brian Schmidt of the Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatory in Australia, have awakened astronomers to the prospect of a cosmic surprise. The whiff of success has intensified their sense of the challenge and excitement of being on the verge of a potentially transforming discovery. Each stride forward by one group quickens the pace of the other.
Preliminary measurements strongly suggest that there must be less -- and perhaps more -- to the universe than previously imagined by cosmologists: That is, less mass in ordinary or exotic matter, which could mean the universe will expand forever. And perhaps more of something else, some mysterious force that seems to be speeding up the universe's expansion, contrary to expectations.
"This has our minds swimming," said Dr. Richard A. Muller, an astrophysicist at the University of California at Berkeley, who is not a member of either team. "This is one of the top astronomy discoveries of the century, certainly of the decade. It's worthy of a Nobel Prize."
Little wonder that competition between the two groups -- one with its roots in physics, the other in astronomy -- is so spirited.
"Hey, what's the strongest force in the universe?" asked Dr. Robert P. Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., an influential member of the Schmidt team. "It's not gravity, it's jealousy."
Some scientists looking on raise a note of caution, saying the astronomers have not eliminated all possibilities for errors in the data and these could be yielding misleading results. "The competitive urges have driven both these groups out on a limb where they shouldn't be," said an astrophysicist who spoke on condition of anonymity. "They may be right, but they don't know it yet."
In separate three-night observing runs at Keck recently, the two teams added to their inventory of examined supernovas. It is too early to interpret the results. But they hope that the new measurements, and more to come, will enable them to deliver definitive answers in a couple of years to fateful questions about the universe's expansion and the possible existence of a pervasive force of energy, which on large scales seems to counteract gravity.
"We may have the answers by the turn of the millennium," Dr. Perlmutter said, his eyes sparkling at a whimsical thought. "Imagine the signs then: 'The End Is Not Coming!' "
 
The Light
Cosmic Beacons That Predate Earth
Every few seconds, a dying star explodes somewhere in the universe, shining through space like a faraway beacon. Detected at just the right moment, astronomers have discovered, these beacons seem to show the way to long-sought landfalls of knowledge. They can reveal not only the fate of stars, but also of the universe in its entirety.
Peering deep into the night sky with telescopes in Chile, Hawaii, Arizona, and outer space, the teams have learned to isolate such supernovas from the background light of faraway galaxies. They begin by taking pictures of a large section of the sky away from the light of the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. These pictures are compared with earlier ones of the same region.
Computers scan the pictures, subtracting known galactic light, to detect any new light source, a possible supernova. Snapshots are taken 30 minutes later to make sure the light was not has not moved. If it has, it means the light probably camea cosmic ray or asteroid.
Then the two teams take turns here at one of the twin 32-foot-diameter Keck telescopes and with observations by the Hubble Space Telescope in Earth orbit, examining these light sources in greater detail. Out of dozens of candidates, a few are identified at each viewing opportunity as a particular kind of exploding star, type Ia supernovas, useful in measuring changes in the expansion rate of the universe over time.
The type Ia's begin as white dwarfs. These are old stars that have converted most of their hydrogen and helium to carbon and oxygen and have collapsed to an incredibly dense sphere, with nearly the mass of the Sun compressed into a volume no larger than that of the Earth. If the white dwarf has a large companion star, which is not uncommon, the dwarf's powerful gravitational pull steadily robs matter from the giant. Once the dwarf reaches a critical mass of 1.4 solar masses, a thermonuclear explosion rips it apart.
Because all white dwarfs have about the same mass at the time they explode, all the supernovas should have much the same intrinsic brightness, astronomers reason. Thus, if their light is carefully analyzed, these explosions should make ideal "standard candles" for measuring cosmic distances. But astronomers must work fast.
As Dr. Gerson Goldhaber, a University of California physicist on the Perlmutter team, explained, "A type Ia supernova can shine brighter than an entire galaxy, but only for a month or so before it becomes too faint for even the largest telescopes to observe at these distances."
Astronomers compare the light from supernovas near and far to estimate the distance of each from Earth. The farther away the supernova, the dimmer its light. The most distant ones discovered so far appear to have occurred more than seven billion years ago, about halfway back to the supposed moment of cosmic creation in the Big Bang. The nearer ones signal explosions some five billion years ago, a little before the Sun and its planets were created.
So far away and long ago are these supernovas that although their ancient light is only now coming into view, their remains have long been scattered beyond recognition as so much stardust.
Next, the astronomers plot the supernova distances against the "redshift" of the objects' light, a measure of how fast cosmic expansion was carrying the galaxies outward at the time of each explosion. This motion displaces the light of an object toward the long-wavelength, or red, end of the spectrum -- the optical equivalent of the drop in pitch of a receding train's whistle. It was Hubble's study of the redshifts and distances of galaxies that led to the discovery that the universe is not static, as Albert Einstein and other scientists had always assumed, but expanding.
An initial goal of the supernova observations was to determine the deceleration of the cosmic expansion, a presumed consequence of the braking effect from the gravitational force of all matter in the universe. Astronomers had expected to see the nearer supernovas expanding more slowly than earlier, more distant ones.
But if they are reading the supernova distances and lights correctly, as the two teams announced in separate reports in January, at best the universe's expansion rate has slowed so little that gravity will never be able to stop it. This appeared to confirm earlier intimations of a universe with a mass density too low to fit many theories. The most likely interpretation, the scientists concluded, is that the universe will expand forever, galaxies continuing to drift apart and everything becoming darker and more tenuous.
Two possible cosmic futures may thus be ruled out. The universe seems to lack sufficient mass to halt expansion and bring about a cosmic collapse in a final Big Crunch, or to slow expansion to a point of equilibrium, a state between contraction and infinite expansion. Most cosmologists have favored the latter prospect because it accords more comfortably with their models amplifying on the Big Bang theory.
While theorists were digesting this, the Schmidt team grew bold and reported even more stunning results, which both teams had been hinting at for months. At a meeting of astrophysicists in February, Dr. Alexei V. Filippenko, an astronomer at the University of California at Berkeley, announced that supernova data strongly suggested that the universe's expansion is not slowing down at all, but speeding up.
The announcement rankled members of the Perlmutter group, who said they had the same results from a larger store of data but felt it premature to go public yet. They also considered their rivals johnny-come-latelies to the research. The Schmidt group had joined the effort in 1995, they noted, after Dr. Perlmutter's work had already demonstrated the feasibility of the strategy and many of the analytical techniques.
"Basically, they have confirmed our results," Dr. Goldhaber, said, referring to the accelerating-expansion findings. "They only had 14 supernovas, and we had 40. But they won the first point in the publicity game."
Even more important, the announcement forced cosmologists to reconsider ideas once considered unthinkable. Perhaps, after all, there is another force, in addition to gravity, playing a dominant role in the universe's expansion. This could be a pervasive repulsive force, known as the cosmological constant, that presumably is a quantum phenomenon of energy in empty space.
As both the cosmic and career implications of their research sink in, differences between the two teams have grown more apparent, though each insists this is not a rancorous contest. "We get irritated at each other," Dr. Perlmutter said, "but we're not feuding."
Indeed, the two groups -- Dr. Perlmutter's Supernova Cosmology Project and Dr. Schmidt's High-Z (meaning high redshift, or extremely distant) Supernova Search -- exchange information, use some of the same instruments and on occasion yield telescope time to the other.
One morning at his Berkeley office, Dr. Perlmutter was on the telephone with rival astronomers at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in northern Chile. Bad weather there the night before had disrupted observations by his team. If the weather did not improve, he asked, would the rivals give up their telescope time later in the week for a couple of hours? He would, of course, repay the time. No problem, the rival astronomers said.
The competition may even be productive. Cosmologists are taking the findings much more seriously because the two teams, checking each other, are getting the same results.
"Science goes more quickly with competition," said Dr. Filippenko, who started with the Perlmutter team and switched sides two years ago. "There's more attention to detail because you don't want to be embarrassed by some oversight, as can happen in science."
Another University of California astronomer on the Schmidt team, Dr. Adam G. Reiss, said: "The competition has heightened the quality of work by both teams. They had to make mistakes in the beginning that helped both of us. It's part of the learning curve. We benefited, and they have benefited from some of the trails we have blazed in correcting for possible errors in the data."
But the competition is not without tensions and clashes of ego. Members of the Perlmutter group say that Dr. Filippenko, a specialist in the spectroscopic analysis of supernova light, defected to the other side because he felt he was not receiving sufficient recognition for his work. Dr. Filippenko said he thought he "could make a greater contribution to science on the Schmidt team."
The Perlmutter group complains that the others often fail to credit their pioneering work and seem to dwell on a few of their early mistakes. When Dr. Filippenko noted such shortcomings at a recent meeting, Dr. Perlmutter bristled.
Nor can the Perlmutter forces seem to forget or forgive Dr. Kirshner's criticism of their initial efforts. It threatened the struggling project's very existence. As a leading expert on supernovas, he served on committees reviewing the research for its financial backers, the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.
"Bob Kirshner was pooh-poohing our research every step of the way; he said the approach would never work," Dr. Goldhaber recalled. "In 1995, we started to get results, and he decided he also wanted to try it."
Looking on the positive side, Dr. Muller said, "Jumping in like that is the greatest compliment a former critic can pay."
In the beginning, as Dr. Kirshner sees it, the rate of supernova discoveries by the Perlmutter team was discouragingly low, and the margin for error in interpreting their brightness was unacceptably high. By the middle of the decade, though, prospects for success soared with a better understanding of type Ia supernovas, reduced error margins, greater computer power and new telescopes like the Keck and the Hubble.
Besides, Dr. Kirshner and fellow supernova astronomers felt confident that their expertise could make a difference, even though their competitors had a head start. So why let the physicists win uncontested?
"Everything is in the details," Dr. Kirshner said. "Which filters to use, how to do calibration, how to take light-curves and interpret them. We invented how to do most of that."
Good scientists are like that, Dr. Perlmutter pointed out in a generous interpretation of his rivals' motivations. "Scientists have to be a little arrogant just to have the confidence necessary to try to do unusual things," he said. "You tend to think that, if it's that difficult a task, I had better do it myself to be sure it gets done. Also, there are probably selfish reasons: They had done a lot of work on supernovas and wanted to have the fun of being in on the big action."
 
The Cultures
Two Disciplines, Two Temperaments
Some of the strains between the teams stem from differences in organization, background and temperament.
The small, tightly-knit Perlmutter group grew out of research at the Lawrence Berkeley laboratory, which remains the center of operations. Dr. Perlmutter is clearly the dominant leader. Like him, many of the team's early participants were physicists being drawn to astronomy. Experimental physicists, onlookers have noted, tend to work in such centralized laboratory settings. In recent years, though, more astronomers and theoretical astrophysicists have been added to the team.
Because Dr. Perlmutter developed most of the methods for finding and analyzing supernovas in numbers sufficient for cosmological research, often in the face of skepticism, his group came to feel a proprietary claim on the field. And Dr. Perlmutter has been extremely cautious in issuing formal reports on the latest findings.
The other group, by contrast, is much more loosely organized, with team members scattered at universities and observatories in several countries. Dr. Schmidt of Australia gets them all together for a meeting only once a year. No one person is the team spokesman; whoever is responsible for a particular aspect of the research takes the lead in announcing the results.
"We work in a spirit of cheerful anarchy," Dr. Kirshner said.
Nearly all of the members are astronomers with considerable supernova experience, notably Dr. Kirshner, who discovered his first supernova in 1972. This could explain their willingness in February to plunge in by announcing an accelerating cosmic expansion and explicitly invoking the cosmological constant as a likely interpretation.
Dr. Reiss of the Schmidt group acknowledged that both teams arrived at the result at about the same time. But just because their data agree does not mean the teams or other scientists are ready to accept the accelerating universe as a fact. They are particularly troubled that galactic dust may be confusing astronomers on how far away the supernovas are. Dust between here and the objects could seriously dim the light and make them appear to be more distant than they actually are.
Dust, Dr. Reiss noted, has been the cause of many blunders in astronomy. For a long time, dust obscuring much of the visible light of Milky Way stars misled astronomers into thinking that Earth was at the center of the galaxy, not off in a spiral arm. His study of supernova light in several colors is credited with largely eliminating uncertainties about the effects of dust on distance estimates for supernovas.
Many theoretical astrophysicists are still reserving judgment and want more assurances that dust or other basic oddities in the supernova data, known as systematic errors, are not leading observers astray again. Besides dust distortions, these include the possibility that type Ia supernovas are somewhat different in different epochs, causing misleading light variations.
"That's a real concern," said Dr. Michael S. Turner, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago. "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and all the systematics have not been cleared to everyone's satisfaction."
Dr. Perlmutter said his team "had closed more loopholes since January." Dr. Filippenko said, "We have done enough to satisfy ourselves that at least there is nothing obviously wrong with the results."
But the hunt for any systematic errors remains a priority in the new observations and analysis by both groups. Eventually, they hope to extend supernova observations even deeper in time, to about 10 billion years ago.
 
The Future
Figuring Distances, And Ramifications
For three successive nights, when the fog dissipated and the electronics behaved, the Keck telescope swung from target to target, its spectrograph examining supernova candidates identified the previous week by the Perlmutter group. A spectrograph breaks down light into parallel rays, each one characteristic of chemical elements that are ejected from the exploding star.
It was the job of Dr. Isabel M. Hook, an astronomer with the European Southern Observatory near Munich, to analyze the blue-and-green graphs with sharp peaks and valleys, like plots of stock prices in a volatile year.
Looking intently at her computer screen, Dr. Hook studied the first spectral patterns to confirm that the bright object in Keck's gaze really was a type Ia supernova and then estimate its redshift. Her judgment was crucial in deciding whether to continue observing the object for more detailed exposures or to move on to others.
Each promising supernova discovery is followed up with additional observations at other telescopes. One purpose is to plot a graph of each supernova's brightness over time, its so-called light curve. If the astronomers have caught the supernova on the rise, its light brightens to a peak a few days after it is first detected. Then it dims in a slow, downward curve for about two months at most.
It is from these data that the all-important determination of the supernova's distance will be made. The intrinsic brightness of the Ia type is almost but not quite invariably the same, but a group of astronomers led by Dr. Mark M. Phillips of the Cerro Tololo telescope in Chile developed a technique for analyzing these light curves to recognize and correct for slight differences. The more slowly the light curve declines, they found, the brighter the supernova was.
"I happen to think that these are the best standard candles we've ever had," said Dr. Turner of Chicago.
By now, the Perlmutter team has discovered about 130 type Ia supernovas, mostly in the last three years; critical follow-up research has been conducted on 78.
The team's most recent conclusions are based on 41 supernovas. The Schmidt team is still behind in numbers, but catching up. It has detected 70 supernovas and has a significant amount of data on more than 30. A detailed study of 16, Dr. Kirshner said, is being prepared now for publication.
During his last observing night at Keck, Dr. Perlmutter spent long stretches on the telephone with a colleague in Berkeley preparing an application for more telescope time this fall.
Both teams express confidence in their findings, but are looking for more evidence that what they are seeing -- an accelerating expansion and something like the cosmological constant -- is really there.
"Nobody is compelled to believe our evidence so far," Dr. Kirshner said, though confirmation could come early in the next century.
Two spacecraft, the American Microwave Anisotropy Probe in 2000 and the European Planck satellite in 2005, are expected to provide independent and definitive tests of the supernova results. They are to chart with greater accuracy than ever the cosmic background radiation, the pervasive echo from the Big Bang.
Encoded in the radiation's tiny temperature variations are strong clues to the density of the universe, the value of any cosmological constant and other characteristics of cosmic evolution. In the beginning, it seems, was an imprint of cosmic destiny.
But cosmologists are not waiting.
"They are already maneuvering around the data," Dr. Turner said, as they look for shortcomings in the supernova findings or ways to preserve their theories, if it should be true that strange energy forces are speeding up the universe's expansion into an infinite future.

Charts: "THREE UNIVERSES"
According to the simplest solution of Einstein's theory of general relativity, the expansion of the universe can have three outcomes:
 
"Open"Universe
If the density of mass and energy is too low, the universe will not generate enough gravity to stop from expanding forever.
 
"Flat" Universe
The density is just right, resulting in enough gravity to cause the universal expansion to coast gradually to a stop after an infinite time.
 
"Closed" Universe
If the density is greater than a certain critical value, gravitation will eventually halt the expansion, and the universe will recontract ending in a "Big Crunch." (pg. F1)
 
"The Fate of the Universe"
The study of very distant exploding stars, or supernovas, is providing scientists with new information about the ultimate fate of the Universe. It seems to contain less mass than previously thought, which could mean the Universe will continue expanding forever.
 
1. Looking for Cosmic Beacons
In order to find out whether the rate of the universe's expansion is slowing down or speeding up, astronomers look at supernovas of a specific type called 1a, because they are all thought to be of virtually identical intrinsic brightness, like light bulbs of standard wattage. Thus, by measuring their apparent brightness, astronomers can tell how far away they are. The most distant of these supernovas provide a picture of how the universe was expanding about seven billion years ago (the time it takes their light to reach us). By knowing how fast these exploding stars were moving away from us then, and how far away they are, astronomers can compute the expansion rate at that moment of cosmic history and compare it to more recent times.
 To detect supernovas, scientists take pictures of portions of the night sky and compare them to earlier ones of the same region to detect any new light source, a possible supernova. The pictures are taken again 30 minutes later, to make sure the light is still there and is not a transient asteroid or cosmic rays.

2. Redshift and Brightness
Once a possible Supernova is found a much more detailed analysis begins, using Keck telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope in Earth orbit. Scientists use spectroscopy (a) to clearly identify type 1a Supernovas and to calculate how fast the galaxy containing the Supernova was going away from us at the time of the event. Then they study the light curve (b) of the Supernova to determine its distance from us.
 
How fast is it going away?
When a light source is moving away from us, the wavelength of the light lengthens, and the light shifts to the red side of the spectrum. This effect is called redshift. Instead of measuring the receding velocity of a galaxy directly, astronomers measure the wavelength change of the light emitted from the galaxy. Then they convert this change to the moving speed. The diagram shows that when the spectrum of a nearby type 1a supernova is stretched to match the redshift of the distant light source, both patterns are very similar. That suggests that the more distant light source is indeed a type 1a supernova.
 
How far is it?
The light curves of type 1a supernovas (a graph of their brightness over time) are all very nearly the same. And since their intrinsic brightnesses are also the same, astronomers can know how far a supernova is by comparing its apparent or relative brightness to that of nearby supernovas of known distance.
 
The universe will expand forever
Knowing the recession speeds and distances of many supernovas, astronomers can plot them on a Hubble diagram (c) to find out what kind of cosmos we inhabit. If the universe were expanding at a constant rate, the points would lie on a straight line. At large distances, changes in the expansion rate, due to gravity or other forces, show up, and the line bends one way for a closed universe, another way for one that will expand forever. The data favor eternal expansion.

HEADLINE: Albright to See Netanyahu And Arafat In London

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, April 20

 BODY:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, will go to London on May 4 for separate meetings with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright in an effort to revive stalled peace talks.
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who is on a Middle East tour, announced the planned meetings today after talks in Gaza with Mr. Arafat. His remarks were followed by a statement from Washington. 
 James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said the meetings would be held to determine whether American proposals on further Israeli withdrawals in the West Bank and other issues "can provide a basis for a breakthrough" and lead to talks on a permanent peace settlement.
"We are looking for substantive decisions from the leaders, real decisions," Mr. Rubin said.
American officials said the meetings had been arranged several days ago but had been publicly confirmed during Mr. Blair's visit. They said that although no direct talks were planned, a meeting between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat remained a possibility.
The officials said much depended on progress made by Dennis B. Ross, the American special envoy to the Middle East, who is expected to arrive in Israel this weekend with Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk to prepare for the London talks.
Emerging from a meeting with Mr. Arafat, Mr. Blair told a news conference, "The United States, I understand, has said or is going to say shortly that they will invite both the Palestinians and the Government of Israel to bilateral meetings in London on the fourth of May."
Mr. Arafat said, "We welcome this invitation," adding that the Palestinians wanted a four-way meeting with active European participation. Britain is the current holder of the presidency of the European Union.
But Mr. Blair and Mr. Rubin said the talks, held separately, would be with Ms. Albright alone. Mr. Blair said that while Europe sought a role in the economic aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian accords, talks on a further Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank, which is at the core of the current deadlock, would be guided solely by the Americans.
The Israeli Government has called a reported American proposal for a pullout from an additional 13.1 percent of the West Bank unacceptable on the ground that it would compromise vital Israeli security interests. The Israelis are said to be offering a 9 percent withdrawal, and Mr. Netanyahu's inner Cabinet was reported to have debated a modest increase in that number today.
Mr. Arafat said today that the Palestinians accepted Washington's proposals "in principle" but were waiting for them to be made official.
Saeb Erakat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said the meetings in London should not be allowed to become an end in themselves.
"The peace process will not be put back on track by merely meeting here and meeting there," he said. "Mr. Netanyahu must concentrate on substance in order to implement the further redeployment."

HEADLINE: Greenspan, Issuing Warning, Urges Changes in Medicare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said today that the nation's "overall economic performance will be seriously jeopardized" unless Congress slows the growth of Medicare and redesigns the program to make patients more sensitive to costs.
Mr. Greenspan, the first witness before a bipartisan commission studying ways to prevent Medicare from going bankrupt, said: "Pre-emptive action could avoid wrenching disruptions to our Federal medical programs and our economy. The longer we wait, the more difficult the adjustments." 
 He said Medicare "has not kept pace with changes in the private health care system." Six million of the 38 million Medicare beneficiaries are in health maintenance organizations, which are used much more widely by workers who get health insurance through their employers.
"Medicare remains largely a fee-for-service program," Mr. Greenspan said. "Unless its disparities with the private sector are addressed, political support for Medicare may well begin to wane, especially if escalating Medicare costs force tax increases or reductions in other Government programs."
Mr. Greenspan's testimony set the stage for 10 months of work by the 17-member panel, which is supposed to submit its recommendations to Congress by March 1, 1999.
He said there was no ideal or optimal share of national income that should be devoted to health care. He resisted the idea of limiting health spending to some fixed proportion of gross domestic product. He noted that the United States spent a bigger share of its gross domestic product on health care than other advanced industrial countries, with little evidence that Americans were any healthier.
In 1982, Mr. Greenspan was chairman of a similar commission that devised ways to keep Social Security solvent, and Congress accepted most of the recommendations in 1983. He offered his advice to the Medicare commission today without being specific about the details, which he said were for politicians to decide.
Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, is chairman of the panel, the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. The commission was created by Congress last year to analyze Medicare's long-term financial problems and to suggest ways of preserving the program for baby boomers.
Medicare finances health care for people who are disabled or 65 or older. The first of 76 million baby boomers will reach 65 in 2011.
Congress had hoped that Mr. Breaux's commission would devise a permanent solution to Medicare's financial problems. But Mr. Greenspan said, "The nation should be prepared to revisit the issue of Medicare reform, perhaps many times, as unanticipated technological changes alter medical practice and private insurance markets evolve."
Mr. Greenspan said new medical technology would have a major influence on the cost and quality of care. But whether it will increase or reduce costs is unclear, he said.
"Technological innovation can decrease the cost of a given course of treatment and thus has the potential to reduce overall costs," he said. "But it also can expand the range of treatment options, with the potential of adding to overall costs. Advances in arthroscopic surgery, for example, have greatly reduced the cost and difficulty of repairing many kinds of knee damage, but the new techniques doubtless have contributed to the enormous increase in the number of knee surgeries that are performed each year."
The aging of the population "will add nearly 20 percent to the level of health care spending" over the next 30 years, Mr. Greenspan said.
Mr. Greenspan said that there had been "overconsumption" of health care in the 1980's and that the cost of employee health benefits had undermined the ability of many companies to compete in world markets. He said that health maintenance organizations and other types of managed care had had "extraordinary success" in taming medical inflation.
"The commission," he said, "may wish to recommend that the Medicare program be reshaped in a way that would encourage beneficiaries and medical providers to make more cost-effective decisions."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Prices of Treasury Issues Are Hurt by New Corporate Offerings

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities prices fell yesterday, hurt by a large amount of new corporate debt beginning to weigh on the market. Not even purchases of Treasury securities by the Federal Reserve buoyed prices in light trading.
The 30-year bond dropped 23/32, to a price of 102 25/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.92 percent, from 5.87 percent Friday, the highest in a week. 
 Traders said the Fed was in the market yesterday as a buyer of Treasury securities, which added cash to the banking system. In this process, known as a coupon pass, the central bank bought an unspecified amount of notes maturing between April 30, 1999, and March 21, 2001, for its own account. Such purchases, done by the Fed from time to time, can tend to strengthen bond prices.
Government securities will likely remain under pressure as a wave of corporate debt comes to market this week. Kim Rupert, an economist with Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said the supply issue was magnified in importance by the relative lack of economic news.
There are estimates of $8 billion to $15 billion in corporate issuance to be priced. The list of large companies looking to take advantage of low interest rates includes Ford Motor Credit, General Motors, GTE and Dell Computer.
Ford Motor Credit will be pricing a $2.5 billion global bond issue through lead managers Salomon Smith Barney and Bear, Stearns. The fall in Government bond prices may have partly resulted from sales of Treasuries by underwriters of new corporate debt. Sometimes the underwriters will hedge the transactions by selling Treasury securities from their portfolios. When the corporate deals are completed, the underwriters will repurchase Treasuries.
The Government's own supply of new debt also may have contributed to some weakness in prices yesterday.

HEADLINE: Chinese Political Yeast

 BODY:
Nine years after it crushed the Tiananmen Square democracy movement, China's leadership seems ever so slightly to be loosening its stranglehold on political dissent. It is too soon to know whether the new openness will last, or grow, but something is stirring in China that bears encouragement and close monitoring by the United States.
On Sunday, Wang Dan, the most prominent leader of the Tiananmen movement still in prison, was released for medical treatment in the United States. That comes after last November's medical release of China's senior democracy campaigner, Wei Jingsheng, and signals a somewhat more humane attitude toward those who have challenged Communist Party rule. Regrettably, Mr. Wang and Mr. Wei had to accept exile from China as a condition of their release. 
 Perhaps more significant is the increased latitude tentatively allowed for people to campaign in China for limited democratic reforms. Since January a number of newspapers and journals have printed lively exchanges on subjects like expanding individual rights, extending village elections and shrinking the reach of the Government and the Communist Party.
Since a party congress last year confirmed President Jiang Zemin's position as China's most powerful leader, he has seemed more willing to depart from earlier orthodoxies. Li Peng, who ordered the Tiananmen massacre, remains the No. 2 leader. But his new position as speaker of Congress gives him a less direct role in enforcing conformity. The most dramatic change has been the designation of Zhu Rongji, a strong economic reformer, as Prime Minister. Mr. Zhu's program does not include political liberalization. But it does call for the party and Government to step back from direct control of economic life.
The new openness remains limited and could easily be reversed. Beijing still harshly punishes any advocacy of independent labor unions at a time when labor unrest over economic issues and working conditions is increasing. Washington should continue to press for the release of political prisoners not yet benefiting from the new climate.
Twice in recent decades -- in 1978 and 1989 -- China seemed to edge warily toward greater democracy only to be thrown back by a new wave of government repression. This time continued modernization of China's economy may prove a powerful incentive for political reform. That is certainly something the world would cheer, and a development that Bill Clinton should encourage as he prepares to visit China in June.

HEADLINE: Election Year May Make Social Security Too Hot to Handle

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20

 BODY:
As the House moves to center stage in the budget debate, Republicans will soon face a critical decision: Do they risk taking the first steps toward redesigning the Social Security system in an election year?
President Clinton has called for a yearlong national dialogue on the impending fiscal problems of the Federal retirement program, pushing the effort to fashion a comprehensive solution into the less politicized environment of 1999. 
 But Speaker Newt Gingrich and Representative John R. Kasich , the Budget Committee chairman, are urging the Republican-controlled Congress to act before the midterm election to get a jump on the President and on the issue.
The two Republicans are promoting slightly different plans to use the expected budget surpluses, starting this year, to create individual retirement accounts for the estimated 130 million workers paying Social Security payroll taxes.
In his Georgia district today, Mr. Gingrich called the move his "highest goal for the year." In a telephone interview, he said he was being propelled by new estimates suggesting that the surplus by the end of the fiscal year could reach $50 billion.
"You can't have that kind of money sitting in Washington without the liberals spending it," Mr. Gingrich said.
Mr. Clinton's budget proposal called for the surpluses to be preserved until a comprehensive plan is reached to insure the solvency of Social Security. That is also viewed as a tactic to fend off large Republican tax cuts.
Other senior figures in the House Republican leadership, however, are skittish about taking the lead on Social Security, which is an issue that the Democrats have wielded against Republicans in past elections.
And the White House wants to fend off the plans as well, for political and legislative reasons. Aides to Mr. Clinton are fearful that if Social Security becomes sharply politicized this year, it could poison the environment for a comprehensive, bipartisan rescue plan next year. And they also worry that by divorcing one of the most attractive elements of overhaul -- individual accounts -- from painful steps like a possible increase in the retirement age, a bailout will become more difficult.
"We would oppose any effort that drains the surplus prior to a complete Social Security fix," said Gene Sperling, the President's senior economic adviser. "But as a part of a comprehensive Social Security fix, we think their idea deserves a fair hearing from all sides."
Part of what the House Republicans will be weighing across the next weeks and months is whether the politics of Social Security have changed as younger people have become pessimistic about the program's future and Americans have become more comfortable with investing in the stock market.
Social Security has arguably been the most popular government social program in existence. And for two decades, it has been considered the third rail of American politics -- anyone who touches it faces political death.
The Republicans lost their Senate majority in 1986 after they tried to reduce Social Security cost-of-living increases to control deficits. And in the last Presidential election, Mr. Clinton and the Democrats relentlessly hammered the Republican Congress for seeking to slow the growth of Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly.
But Social Security faces a crisis early next century when the 76 million in the baby boom generation start retiring and putting a strain on the system.
As a result, lawmakers including Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat, are proposing bailout plans that would privatize part of the system. Such plans would give individuals the power to invest part of their payroll tax in stocks, bonds or other saving plans.
The proposal by Mr. Kasich, an Ohio Republican, is more modest. It would not touch the payroll tax or the current Social Security system. Instead, it would devote 80 percent of any government surplus to the creation of individual accounts. This would give each worker who pays the payroll tax a starting account worth several hundred dollars that would grow each year in which there was a budget surplus.
His proposal would require that the money be kept in the account until retirement, and individuals could choose from government-approved investment options. Both contributions from the government and the investment earnings would accumulate free of taxes.
Because these accounts would be separate and on top of the current Social Security program, Mr. Kasich said his idea would carry no political risk -- appealing to those under 45 without scaring the elderly.
"Both from a policy and a political point of view I think this is win-win for the Republicans," Mr. Kasich said, "because it lets people begin to build for their retirement years and it does not in any way affect Social Security."
Mr. Gingrich's plan differs in that 75 percent of the money eventually withdrawn from such accounts would be used to offset government Social Security benefits. He said this would keep Social Security solvent without requiring additional payroll taxes or benefit reductions, though critics note that such calculations assume continued surpluses and a healthy stock market.
But many liberal Democrats oppose any move to create privatized Social Security accounts, with strategists promising that such plans would be seized upon as a campaign issue.
"Any time Republicans tamper with Social Security, voters are nervous," said Mark Mellman, a pollster who works for the Congressional Democratic leadership, "and you can bet there will be those who will help them get even more nervous. The fundamental problem Republicans have is people don't trust them when it comes to Social Security."
Democrats say that they are likely to brand the plans to use the surplus as thinly disguised tax cuts that will endanger a comprehensive Social Security bailout later.
To bolster his caucus, Mr. Gingrich has been circulating Republican poll data finding that voters below age 40 do not believe that they will get Social Security when they retire and that Republicans are especially dubious. The pollsters also found voters strongly in favor of allowing those under 40 to invest a portion of their payroll taxes for their future retirement.
Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist working with Mr. Kasich, argued that the Democrats could end up hurting themselves with voters under 45 if they continue to take their traditional approach to Social Security. "This is not 1982. It's 1998," he said. "They may become the party that's not willing to work with middle-aged and younger voters to meet their concerns over their retirement security."

HEADLINE: Union Pacific Chief Faults Plans to Restore Competition

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: FORT WORTH, April 20

 BODY:
The top officer of the Union Pacific Railroad, the nation's largest, said today that it would resist plans by Federal regulators meant to restore competition because the results would only further erode service.
Richard K. Davidson, the chairman and chief executive, made the remarks during an interview while on an inspection tour from here to Dallas. He spoke three days after the Surface Transportation Board ordered the broadest review of the rules governing railroads since they were deregulated in the early 1980's. Huge and continuing snarls on Union Pacific in the aftermath of its 1996 acquisition of Southern Pacific have cost shippers billions of dollars and brought calls from Congress for much closer oversight. 
 Mr. Davidson, attributing the clogged tracks and yards to too much traffic and too little capacity, rather than too few carriers, said that even giving rivals temporary access to its tracks in Texas had only compounded the tie-ups.
"Just cramming more people into already congested facilities would create additional problems," he said. "What created these problems for our customers wasn't a lack of competition."
He appeared more open, however, to easing the rules allowing the railroads' captive shippers to win rate disputes before the board. The current standards make it easy for railroads to show that their returns on a route are inadequate, he said, and therefore nearly impossible for shippers to win.
"The logic behind it is wonderful," he said of the rules meant to guarantee the railroads adequate revenues. "But it's a huge heartburn issue for our customers."
The Surface Transportation Board approved the $5.4 billion Southern Pacific merger, the industry's largest ever, over shippers' loud protests. But with its reauthorization up before Congress this year, the board, the successor to the Interstate Commerce Commission, has come under great pressure to justify its continuing existence.
On Friday, the board ordered the railroads and their customers to negotiate, or choose experts to recommend changes in rules that the shippers say only protect railroad monopolies resulting from years of consolidation.
Railroads concede that they charge higher rates to captive shippers, or those with only one choice of railroad. But the railroads defend these rates as necessary to remain competitive elsewhere and earn enough to improve their systems.
Union Pacific's uncompromising stance heading into negotiations on track access increases the odds that regulators or Congress would take matters into their own hands.
Ed Rastatter, policy director for the National Industrial Transportation League, the leading organization of shippers, reacted with tempered enthusiasm to the board's steps. Though negotiating with the railroads and the board can be productive, he said, his approach, like President Reagan's to the Soviets, was, "Trust, but verify."
Lack of competition on many Union Pacific routes has left customers with no alternatives, he said. "This has pointed up a real working definition of a captive shipper: It's anyone who's still using Union Pacific."
To that, Mr. Davidson later responded with a grimace and a rueful comment: "I hope he's joking."
A leading opponent of the merger doubted that customers had much to gain from any talks with the railroads, saying the railroads could easily intimidate them. "It is impossible to come up with any sort of reasonable agreement when one person has all the economic power," said Charles R. Matthews, chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission. Union Pacific has eased the tie-ups around Houston and much of Texas in recent weeks. A major rail yard in Fort Worth, once packed with Houston's overflow, appeared to be smoothly sorting rail cars and routing trains.
From here to the company's headquarters in Dallas and beyond, the only evident problem along the tracks came in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite. There, hundreds of new cars sat on a Union Pacific lot awaiting another company's trucks to haul them to dealers. Told by a yard manager that the trucks had recently added Saturday pickups, Mr. Davidson shot back, "They ought to be working Sundays, too."
But even as things improve around here, snarls have developed elsewhere. Delays at the Texas border with Mexico backed trains all the way up into Kansas, causing Union Pacific to refuse some shipments.
With the border situation now beginning to ease, the railroad's tracks to the north are becoming congested. So for the system as a whole, trains are still moving slowly.
Union Pacific maintains that only the initial delays in Texas had anything to do with the merger, saying they resulted from growing traffic and inadequate operations, especially on Southern Pacific.
Mr. Davidson no longer ventures to say when trains will be back up to speed throughout its system.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Nasdaq and S.& P. Indexes Reach Highs for Second Day

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Drug and technology stocks extended their rally yesterday, helping to push the Nasdaq composite index and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to new highs for a second consecutive session.
But trading overall was lackluster, and declines among financial shares dragged down the Dow Jones industrial average. 
 Technology issues, including Microsoft, Dell Computer, Intel, Linear Technology and Qualcom, lifted the the Nasdaq composite index 20.54 points, or 1.10 percent, to a high of 1,887.14. Some of the gains came as investors bet that good quarterly earnings would signal stronger performance for entire sectors. Semiconductor shares like Intel and Applied Materials, for example, rose as investors bought those stocks because of the better-than-expected quarterly earnings of another semiconductor company, Novellus.
The S.& P. 500 index inched up 0.93 point, to 1,123.65, also a new high.
Earnings expectations helped bolster shares of I.B.M., a Dow component. I.B.M. rose 3 7/16, to 11 13/16, on the belief that first-quarter earnings would top analysts' forecasts. After the market closed, I.B.M. reported earnings of $1.06 a share, down from $1.16 a share in the quarter a year earlier, and slightly above analysts' already-reduced forecasts.
The Dow, which reached a record high on Friday, slipped yesterday, falling 25.66 points, to 9,141.84. American Express and J. P. Morgan were among the largest decliners.
A lull in the merger activity among financial services companies and rising interest rates on Treasury bonds helped push financial shares lower, analysts said.
The American Stock Exchange Securities Broker/Dealer index fell 1.24 percent yesterday, making it one of the day's worst-performing indexes. Still the index is up 21.96 percent, reflecting the surge in mergers and acquisitions among financial services firms. The gain is more than the year-to-date gains of the Dow, up 15.6 percent; the S.& P. 500, up 15.79 percent, and the Nasdaq, up 20.17 percent.
Investors have so far taken little solace from the fact that as the earnings reporting season continues this week, the earliest corporate reports have been in line with expectations and with the average performance in recent years, said Chuck Hill, director of research at the First Call Corporation, a Boston-based company that compiles analysts' earnings forecasts.
With approximately 205 companies of the S.& P. 500 reporting, the earnings of 52 percent of the companies have exceeded analysts' expectations, while about 25 percent have fallen short, Mr. Hill said.
"First-quarter earnings were never really the problem," said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. "The second and third quarter are much more of a question mark."
But investors' inclination to scoop up shares in various sectors based on the positive news about one or two companies in the group benefited drug stocks yesterday. Expectations that Pfizer's new impotence drug, Viagra, may be one of the best-selling drugs ever, for example, aided that stock and the entire drug sector.
Pfizer closed at 113 3/8, up 8 3/16. The gains lifted Pfizer's market capitalization to $147.24 billion, helping it outpace Merck as the largest United States drug company in terms of market value, now at $146.21 billion. (Merck's annual sales, at $23 billion in 1997, still outdistance those of Pfizer, which were about $13 billion last year.)
Merck closed at 122 1/4, up 1 7/8.
Such sector buying keeps some analysts like Mr. Cardillo concerned about the high valuations of stocks and investors' seeming lack of caution as they continue to pursue gains and push prices higher.
And in some instances, investors seemed to heed the calls for caution from analysts as positive earnings were not enough to sway some buyers.
Although AT&T reported earnings that beat analysts' forecasts, the stock fell 11 5/16, to 65 3/16. The decline illustrated investors' disappointment with the composition of the earnings gain, which was largely attributed to cost-cutting moves by the company.
Negative news also hurt Nike. Its stock fell 11/16, to 43 3/16, after it was reported that the company was sued in a California court over labor conditions at factories run by its subcontractors in Asia.

HEADLINE: SHRUGGING OFF DOOM: A special report.;
Shops Closing, Japan Still Asks, 'What Crisis?'

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: OMIYA, Japan, April 15

 BODY:
Aside from the fact that his beloved little business is collapsing after a lifetime of effort, Mitsuo Okura is rather pleased with life.
Mr. Okura, a wry 62-year-old, sits in a little office beside his four-employee factory, which spits out gobs of black plastic that eventually end up in Toyota and Honda cars. Pictures of his grandchildren decorate the wall behind him, and he smiles amiably as he mocks his own foolishness for expanding his factory eightfold during Japan's "bubble economy" of the late 1980's. 
 His eyes crinkle pleasantly as he acknowledges that his own son and daughter have declined to inherit the business. He accepts that in the economic competition for survival of the fittest, he will end up in a more ruthless animal's digestive tract.
"People complain about the bad economy," Mr. Okura mused here in Omiya, a little town nearly 200 miles southwest of Tokyo. "But when I look around the house, I've got everything I want. I've got three cars, and most families around here have two or three as well. I've got a couple of televisions, and so do most people. I've got a washing machine, a refrigerator, and so do all my neighbors."
"Even if no one sees a bright future," he added, "there's no feeling of crisis."
And that may be Japan's problem: life is too comfortable.
The lack of a crisis mentality means that Japan cannot summon the political will to lay off surplus workers, to extinguish insolvent banks, to snuff out the hopes of the kindly old ladies who run rice shops and futon stores. It means that there is little public pressure on Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to push for the sweeping deregulation and huge stimulus measures that the United States is urging.
Japanese and foreign economists mostly agree that such a far-reaching restructuring is necessary to invigorate the second largest economy in the world. Japan is widely seen as caught in a bramble of regulatory barriers that stifle competition in finance, retailing, transportation, medicine, agriculture, telecommunications and many other sectors, and critics often say that without deregulation Japan will continue to stagnate as it has for the last seven years, sapping strength from the United States and other countries.
Indeed, the Clinton administration sometimes suggests that Japan is on the verge of economic collapse, and it portrays Japan as a threat to the entire global economy. But sit on the tatami mat floor in a Japanese home like Masamitsu Nishi's here in Omiya, and life still seems so secure that people feel little urgency about change.
Mr. Nishi, a former Honda worker who now runs a construction company with 40 employees, says business is terrible, but he adds that his family and neighbors have been scarcely affected by the downturn. Indeed, most people in Omiya say they do not know anyone who has ever been laid off.
Unemployment in Japan is at a record high, but that is still just 3.6 percent -- more than a percentage point below the rate in the United States. Inflation is zero. Interest rates are negligible, and business bankruptcies per capita are still one-third lower in slumping Japan than in booming America.
"There isn't much feeling of a downturn among ordinary people," Mr. Nishi said, despite Japan's slightly negative growth for the last year. As he relaxed on a cushion on the floor, nursing a coffee in the tranquil night air, he added: "Even with my family, business isn't good, but we haven't cut back on our living standard."
So although Japan is enduring its worst slump in a quarter-century, political discontent is not boiling over as it would in the United States. Indeed, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is steadily gaining strength, and people like Mr. Nishi and his wife, Kazuho, perceive the central Government as so remote that it is neither the problem nor the solution.
"As for me," Mrs. Nishi said, "I just don't see any signs of a crisis."
 
The Changes
Some Say Goodbye To the Old Values
Takahiro Tanaka is one of the few casualties of the economic downturn, and his experience underscores how overwhelming a task it will be to transform Japan into a modern market economy.
Businessmen like Mr. Tanaka, a slim 37-year-old who works as a forester in Omiya because his factory went under last year, operate in an environment that is more social than economic. Mr. Tanaka sat back in a friend's home in Omiya the other day and described his failed business as based not on contracts or prices but rather on traditional values such as "giri-ninjo," or duty and empathy.
The result has been a Japanese economy whose outward facade is skyscrapers and business suits, but whose human interactions are still rooted in traditional concepts of honor. These ways of doing business are frustrating for American officials but would be immediately understandable to any 18th century samurai.
Mr. Tanaka was in charge of a 30-year-old family business making pearl souvenirs and accessories. At its peak it had several dozen employees, but it was just the kind of inefficient factory that has become uncompetitive in Japan because of rising imports and increasing labor costs.
"It just got too hard to compete with imports," he recalled. "Chinese-made pearls come into Japan, and the finished product is the same price as the cost of our materials."
So the family business steadily declined, and it lost money year after year. But because of giri-ninjo, Mr. Tanaka did not take the cost-cutting steps that might have saved his business. "What I kept thinking about most was the employees," he said. "They depended on us. I just couldn't bring myself to dismiss the inefficient ones.
"I thought of offering the employees less money. I'm sure they would have accepted, if I'd offered. But I just couldn't bring myself to do such a thing."
So last year Mr. Tanaka finally had to close the factory, and the employees lost their work anyway. Mr. Tanaka readily admitted that his sense of giri-ninjo was misplaced and a bit foolish.
"I think a person with greater ability might have saved the company, but I wasn't fit for business," he admitted.
Mr. Tanaka and nearly everyone else in Omiya believe that the giri-ninjo economy is inevitably withering away, a process that is most evident in the disappearance of small shops. Japan, far more than Britain, is a nation of shop-keepers, and Japan has more than twice as many shops per capita as the United States.
These little shops are so inefficient that they mostly charge very high prices and survive on webs of giri-ninjo. The stores appeal not to the minds of customers or to their pocketbooks, but to their loyalty -- and these days, that is not enough.
"I have a friend near here, and I was thinking that since her refrigerator was getting old, maybe she would buy a new one from us," said Yachiyo Horie, who runs a little electronics shop with her husband, Nobuhiro. "Then one day I was at her house and I saw a new refrigerator! I thought, 'Hey!'
"Well, I was very curious, but of course I couldn't say a thing. So finally I casually said, 'I see you have a new refrigerator.' But she didn't want to talk about it."
Mrs. Horie shook her head sadly.
"Now even my sister buys electrical things in the big stores," she said. "Like her new washing machine."
Mr. Horie looked reproachfully at his wife. "And a new television," he added.
 
The Trap
A Nice Warm Bath Is Hard to Leave
There is an expression in Japanese, "nurumayu," that describes the coziness of a lukewarm bath even when someone knows that it is time to step naked out of the tub and face the chill. Many Japanese say that their nation's economy is "nurumayu," and they realize that it is time to get out -- but that the bath is so lulling that they cannot summon the energy to do so just yet.
"Frankly, I'd just as soon stay in the bath," mused Hironori Takayama, a young banker in a town near Omiya.
"But these days, even if you try to stay in the bath, the tub will crack and the water will leak out. So if you stay in you risk getting chilly and catching cold. It's not much of a choice."
For people like Mr. Takayama, the problem with economic restructuring is the price in fairness, equality and civility. To foreigners, Japan often seems virtually socialist in mindset, profoundly believing in social equality and relying on the most progressive income tax system of any major country in the world -- including a marginal rate of 65 percent on personal income taxes -- to achieve the equality.
"After the Soviet Union collapsed, I thought that socialism had failed and that capitalism was better," said Mr. Takayama, expressing an epiphany that seemed odd coming from a banker in a dark suit in what is usually thought of as the biggest capitalist economy outside of America. "But when I visited Singapore one time, I saw skyscrapers and then what looked like a slum next to them. I was surprised, and maybe that's because Japan is the only place where that kind of thing doesn't happen, the only place where everybody thinks of themselves as middle class."
Mr. Takayama brooded for a few minutes. Then he added: "I don't want to get out of this bath."
A cultural difference may also be behind the Japanese antipathy for unregulated markets. Americans are risk-takers who are taught to respect explorers and entrepreneurs, while Japanese are drilled to be cautious and to respect bureaucrats. Japan is so intuitively risk-averse that the Japanese language traditionally did not even have a good word for risk.
Japanese often turn to pop-sociology to account for these differences, describing themselves as a "farming people" in contrast to the "hunting peoples" of the West. In effect, Japanese tend to see themselves as economic herbivores, in contrast to the carnivores from Wall Street and the West.
To be sure, the image of peace-loving herbivores does not carry much weight in countries like China or Korea that were invaded and terrorized by Japanese soldiers, nor does the image resonate with American or European companies that were mauled by Japanese manufacturers in the 1980's. But within Japan, the image seems a natural one -- Japanese businesses are indeed extremely reluctant to hurt their own -- and the consequence is disdain for the economic carnage of free markets.
Shinji Hashikura, 42, who runs a five-employee factory making electrical parts in Omiya, sat at his kitchen table and expressed his feelings with a common Japanese saying, "jaku niku, kyo shoku" -- "the strong gobble up the meat of the weak." That, he complained, is a worrisome trend.
" 'Meat of the weak' -- that's me!" Mr. Hashikura said morosely. "I'm the one who's going to be gobbled up. And 80 percent of Japanese are weak meat, too. So when the gobbling begins, we'll all be dead."
Mr. Hashikura paused and exchanged a look with his wife, who sat beside him at the kitchen table.
"But that's the way of the future," he said. "There's nothing we can do."
 
The Competition
Imports Now Shove The Weak Aside
As Mr. Hashikura's comment suggests, there is broad agreement in Omiya that sweeping change is coming to create an economy based more on the concept of "the strong gobble up the meat of the weak." Indeed, many people favor it, saying that even if they themselves are consumed, economic Darwinism is in the interests of the nation.
They say this even though Omiya, which has 5,700 people, could be a loser in a more open system. As in most rural areas, Omiya's economy is largely dependent on Government spending, infrastructure projects and on inefficient little retail shops and factories -- all supplemented by farming and forestry that cannot easily compete with imports.
Kihachiro Nishimura, a silver-haired retired salaryman, sat on the tatami floor of his living room, keeping an eye out for any customers who might walk into the liquor shop that fills the front of his house. Deregulation and the rise of large markets are killing his store, he mused, but the change is still worthwhile.
"I once heard a scholar say that the mass media are very unfair to typhoons," he said. "The media always report about the damage caused, but never about the benefits of all that rain. I feel sorry for the typhoons."
An economic typhoon might destroy his store and other businesses, he said, but Japan as a whole would still benefit.
To be sure, an economic typhoon still is not on the horizon, but Japan's economic structure is clearly changing nonetheless -- not suddenly, not as much as the United States wants, but still profoundly. The change is evident in almost every conversation in Omiya, as people talk about the new supermarkets, about the decline of giri-ninjo business relationships, about the struggle to cut costs and compete with increasing imports.
The word "ability-ism" is the rage now in Japan, and, sure enough, the local bank says it is introducing "ability-ism" in evaluating employees. In other words, workers will be promoted and rewarded according to their merit, and that marks a change in a country where salaries have always risen according to seniority and a Confucian respect for the elderly.
In the nearby city of Matsusaka, a tailor named Eiichi Hashimoto has cut costs by turning to computerized custom tailoring -- the cloth is all cut by computers using Japanese software. Mr. Hashimoto is trying in every way he can to become more competitive, and he says he was particularly struck by what he heard from a friend who runs a car dealership.
"He told the mechanic, 'If you don't work harder, we won't be able to pay you so much!' " Mr. Hashimoto recalled. "I was very impressed with that attitude. I thought my friend was soft in his business management, but now we're all reaching the stage where we have to face international competition."
 
The Challenge
What Will Become Of the Obsolete?
As Japan's economic structure changes, the challenge is what to do with people like Yasuo Murata.
Mr. Murata runs a sawmill in Omiya, and he has been hard-hit by the opening up of Japan's economy. He has gone from five employees to three, and he stood glumly in a drizzle the other day in the midst of the logs.
"Unless the Government changes its policy, it'll be impossible for me to survive here," he said. "The problem is the imports."
Mr. Murata has eight children -- he wanted a son, and kept trying until he got one the eighth time around -- and he figures he can find some job to support them if his mill goes bankrupt. But he fears that it would be a job like a janitor, in a big city somewhere.
"I want the Government to stop imports of logs, but I know that it can't do that," he reflected in a bittersweet tone as he looked out over his sawmill. "Japan is selling hi-tech products to other countries, and I understand that if our Government stops the log imports then the other countries won't buy Japanese cars or hi-tech goods. I understand that the weak are eliminated.
"I'm really against deregulation. But ultimately, I have to accept it. There's no other way."
In a sense, Mr. Murata is facing what the economist Joseph A. Schumpeter called "creative destruction." This is something that Japan used to be very good at, for one of the secrets to its success in this century was its economic adaptability, its willingness to allow industrial euthanasia: Uncompetitive industries were extinguished, and the capital and labor was reallocated to rising industries.
In 1950, 45 percent of the labor force engaged in farming; now it is 3 percent. In the 1950's and 60's, Japanese workers labored in coal mines or churned out cheap clothing and shoes; now those mines and garment factories have closed down, and the children of the miners and shirt-makers have shifted to making automobiles and selling stocks.
Over the last few decades, that economic flexibility eroded sharply as the Government intervened with regulations to protect people from the destruction of inefficient shops and factories. The economy became arthritic and rigid, and the resulting misallocation of resources accounts in part for the stagnation in recent years.
But these days, flexibility is returning to Japan's economy, and the cycle of business destruction and creation seems to be starting up again. A good deal of the economic pain in places like Omiya seems to arise from that process of creative destruction, and it may eventually lead to renewed economic growth.
Take Mr. Okura, the man whose little factory churns out black plastic parts for cars and who cheerfully admits that his factory is a loser. His family underscores the cycle of economic change that is taking place in Japan.
Mr. Okura's parents were farmers, just as most Japanese were when he was born in the 1930's. Then farming became uncompetitive, and so he started his little factory in the 1960's just as the entire nation was riding a manufacturing boom to prosperity.
Now Mr. Okura's factory is likely to fade away before long, but his children have already taken the generational baton in new directions: his daughter is an interior designer and his son is a software engineer who is developing "electronic money" for a credit card company. His children's success has comforted him and reassured him that economic change, however painful and scary, is worthwhile.
"Deregulation is inevitable," Mr. Okura said. "The challenge is to figure out what to do with people like me. But if we just say that new things are no good, then Japan itself will be no good."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Balance Sheet on China

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Four years ago this spring, President Clinton reversed his policy on trade with China. That is enough time to draw up a balance sheet on the new policy.
Before his election in 1992, Mr. Clinton said economic pressure through raised tariffs was the best way to push China into relaxing terrorism against human rights -- and against political and religious dissidents. 
 Since June 1994 he has dropped economic penalties for Chinese human rights abuse. The new policy is to encourage trade with China, despite the huge loss to the U.S. balance of payments. He says encouraging business with China will soften Beijing's treatment of Chinese and Tibetans who talk of political and religious liberty. The Administration also says trade would bring Beijing to security cooperation with America.
This past weekend, China gave early release to Wang Dan, a leader of the Chinese democracy movement before Tiananmen Square. After the massacre there in 1989, he served seven years in prison, sleeping on concrete floors. But to keep him away from other brave Chinese, he was deported to exile in the U.S. and will be arrested if he returns.
The release of Mr. Wang is certainly a fruit of the Clintonian reversal of China policy -- Beijing's political gift to Mr. Clinton's reputation. So was the release of Wei Jingsheng -- also sent to forced exile in the U.S.
But Chinese still courageous enough to complain about religious or political regimentation go on being arrested, sentenced to long terms, handed suddenly extended sentences, put under house arrest when released, or sent far from their homes -- just as before Mr. Clinton made trade his overriding China policy.
The human rights trickle-down he promised has not been felt in the political cells, or on the torture blocks. In December 1996, Chinese officials said that 2,026 Chinese were in Ministry of Justice prisons for "counterrevolutionary" affairs, now called "endangering state security."
But the figure did not include "non-ministry" prisons: the forced-labor camps, detention centers where prisoners can be held for years before trial, lockups for Communist Party members, "old age" homes where elderly religious dissidents are sometimes imprisoned, or house arrest after completion of prison sentences.
About one kind of prison where religious and political dissidents are often sentenced, certain "re-education" camps, Chinese officials did say there was a change. They said the inmates increased from 125,000 to twice that number. Dissidents sometimes say: In China there are lots of shelves to put prisoners.
About Tibet -- the whole nation was imprisoned when Mr. Clinton made his switch. The Tibetan cell remains as deep and dark.
Before Mr. Clinton arrives in Beijing, the Communists may release more prisoners. But other Chinese will be arrested to "keep safety."
The Communists are not at all embarrassed by arrests. Earlier this year Mr. Clinton sent a three-clergy "inquiry" to China, to try to take some heat out of U.S. public anger at the persecution of Chinese Christians.
The mission reported nothing that was unknown and ignored most of what is known about religious persecution in China. Just before the mission arrived, Chinese Protestant clergymen were seized by police. After the mission left, two more Catholic priests were arrested.
Security: Mr. Clinton did his personal part for cooperation. He allowed a U.S. company to give China more of the important space and missile technology that it had already provided to Chinese specialists. The company was one of two that were already under U.S. investigation for the first transfer, which did nothing to diminish the Presidential spirit of cooperation.
After the Clinton turnaround on China, Beijing went on with its version of security cooperation. Chinese batteries dropped missiles into the Taiwan Strait to punish Taiwan for holding a fair election. And China continued selling missiles to Iran, plus chemicals that can enrich uranium in nuclear warheads.
Supporters of human rights welcome Mr. Wang, with embraces. We are glad he will not have to suffer in prison longer -- glad, but not grateful, either to the Politburo or the American President who made himself the prisoner of Beijing.

HEADLINE: Abortion Foes Are Held Liable For Harassment

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 20

 BODY:
A United States District Court jury today ruled that three anti-abortion leaders had violated a Federal racketeering law by conducting a nationwide campaign to intimidate abortion providers and patients.
The jury of two men and four women, who had deliberated since Thursday, found that 21 acts of intimidation, including physical violence outside clinics, amounted to a vast enterprise of extortion under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law. 
 The RICO Act was passed in 1970 as a way to fight organized crime, and some legal scholars have argued that it should not apply to political groups.
The civil case decided today, which was brought by the National Organization for Women, awarded $85,926 in damages to two abortion clinics that were targets of harassment. Under the terms of the racketeering act, the judge is expected to automatically triple that figure, which the individual defendants must pay.
"We cannot tolerate the use of threats and force by one group to impose its views on others," said Fay Clayton, the lawyer who argued the case for NOW.
The 12-year-old case had earlier been dismissed by a Federal judge, who ruled that the racketeering law applied only to organizations motivated by economic gain. But the Supreme Court in 1994 reversed that ruling, and ordered the case to go to trial.
The suit named as defendants two militant anti-abortion groups, Operation Rescue and the Pro-Life Action League, and their leaders, Joseph Scheidler, Timothy Murphy and Andrew Scholberg. Randall Terry, the president of Operation Rescue, had earlier agreed to pay damages in a settlement.
The suit sought damages for two clinics, in Milwaukee and Wilmington, Del., that had been targeted for harassment.
Mr. Scheidler, who has written a book about tactics aimed at shutting down abortion clinics, today promised to appeal the decision, and scoffed at the notion that the ruling could put anti-abortion groups out of business.
"There will still be picketers, maybe more picketers," Mr. Scheidler said. "This may enliven the movement."
G. Robert Blakely, the Notre Dame professor who drafted the racketeering act, said that it was never intended to apply to political groups. He expressed grave concerns that the statute could be used to chill dissent by a wide range of organizations, such as labor unions and gay rights advocates.
"If you look at this case and say it's about abortion, you're missing the point," Professor Blakely said. "Everybody who loves the First Amendment has got to sleep uneasily tonight."
Before the racketeering statute passed, Mr. Blakely recalled, liberals like Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, raised serious concerns about it, saying they feared that President Richard M. Nixon would use the law to stifle anti-war protests.
But Louis Bograd, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the First Amendment "does not guarantee the right to engage in violence and extortion."
In its 1994 ruling, the Supreme Court said that if the racketeering law was not intended to apply to political groups, Congress should have made that explicit.
Gloria Felt, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said the jury underscored the nation's impatience with unruly anti-abortion protests.
"This tells me the public wants these people to grow up and stop the war games," Ms. Felt said. "And where there are differences, work them out in the public policy forum."
Many of the examples of intimidation cited in this case involved blockades at clinic doorways, a tactic that has been illegal since the passage in 1994 of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances law.
Mr. Scheidler, who is among the most militant of anti-abortion leaders, vowed to appeal. A former Benedictine monk, Mr. Scheidler has used bullhorns to cheer protesters at abortion clinics. But he has insisted that he does not condone violence.
In speeches and in his book, "Closed: 99 Ways to Stop Abortion," Mr. Scheidler specifically denounced the use of violence. "I see all of these acts of violence as an admission of defeat," he has said, "that you can't do it through the proper channels."
In the past two decades, there have been an average of seven violent acts per month against abortion clinics, their providers or patients, said Kim Gandy, a spokeswoman for NOW. There are about 2,000 abortion providers in the nation.
Civil libertarians who defended today's ruling said that use of the RICO Act will not impede political protest movements.
But Professor Blakely said that all political demonstrations were going to have cases of excess. "No demonstration is perfect," he said. "Somebody's going to throw a rock. Somebody's going to step on a blade of grass."
Those transgressions should be dealt with through laws governing trespassing and disorderly conduct, Professor Blakely said. The RICO Act could quickly bankrupt many political groups, and just the threat of it could chill dissent, he said.
The law has been successfully used against abortion protesters at least once before, in a case in Philadelphia in the 1970's.
In the trial in Chicago, many abortion providers and patients talked about being physically assaulted and intimidated at clinics. One witness said she was harassed on her way into a clinic for a procedure that had nothing to do with abortion. The woman said that she was, in fact, opposed to abortion, but had testified for NOW because she loathed the tactics of the protesters.
The suit claimed that clinics were entitled to damages, in part because they needed to hire extra security forces to protect the staff and patients.
Susan Hill, the president of the abortion clinics involved in the suit, said: "I'm ecstatic, relieved and I feel safer today than I did yesterday. And I think all clinics feel safer today."

HEADLINE: Spring Is in the Los Angeles Air but the Smog, Chased by El Nino, Is Not

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 20

 BODY:
When the Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo sailed in 1542 past the coastal plain of what became Los Angeles, he was so struck by the dark haze from the Gabrieleno Indian campfires hovering over the mountain-ringed basin that he christened it the Bay of Smokes.
Four and a half centuries later, exacerbated by the internal combustion engine, smog is still a cloudy, consuming fact of life in Los Angeles, which officially has the worst air quality of any city in the United States. But as the annual summer smog season officially begins next month, something here is unusually clear: the sky. 
 On any given morning in recent weeks, the majestic San Gabriel Mountains have made a stunning and surprising backdrop to the city. It is as if a scrim has suddenly lifted on a giant stage. This is often the case in winter, but more than the typical seasonal changes are responsible for the good views this spring. Meteorologists say the unstable currents of El Nino have played the biggest part, piercing the stagnant high-pressure mass of hot desert air that usually traps marine fog and man-made pollution in a brownish, enveloping blend.
At the same time, even the most ardent environmental groups acknowledge that years of tougher controls on automobile and industrial pollution have also played their part, and last year the Los Angeles region posted its cleanest air in the four decades since official monitoring began. There was just one Stage 1 smog alert, which signifies that the air is so polluted with ozone and other substances that officials urge people with respiratory ailments to stay indoors and others to refrain from vigorous outdoor exercise. The single Stage 1 alert compared with 122 such warnings in 1977 and 148 in 1970.
"Air quality has improved dramatically in California over the last 15 years, last summer especially," said Allan Hirsch, a spokesman for the state Air Resources Board. The board sets auto emissions standards and oversees the 35 regional Air Quality Management Districts, which in turn set standards for so-called stationary sources of pollution like factories and machine shops.
"A new California motor vehicle is now more than 90 percent cleaner than a new car here was in the 70's," Mr. Hirsch said.
But the latest gains in air quality have come at a time of uncertainty. The local Air Quality Management District has suffered personnel shake-ups and has rolled back or eased some of its landmark protections of the 1980's. The state is struggling to meet Federal standards for still cleaner cars by early in the next century. And environmental groups worry that the meteorological anomalies of El Nino may be used as an excuse to let up on the fight.
"We need to hold our cheers for now," said Gail Ruderman Feuer, a lawyer with the local office of the Natural Resources Defense Council and head of its air program. "We do not disagree there has been steady progress in cleaning up the air. The problem is, if you take a snapshot in the current year, the air is still the most unhealthful in the country."
Fifty years ago, in the wave of industrialization that followed World War II, "daylight dimouts" in which smog blocked the sun were not uncommon. And 15 years ago, a person could spend a summer here without seeing the landmark Hollywood sign perched in the hills above the city. Now, the afternoon sun routinely bathes the hills in the surreal glow that has inspired artists like David Hockney.
Last year, carbon monoxide pollution levels in central Los Angeles County -- historically the area with the highest levels -- exceeded Federal standards on 15 days, compared with 20 days in 1996 and 38 days in 1987. Ozone levels exceeded Federal standards on 68 days in 1997, down from 90 the previous year.
New cars made for sale in California are equipped with pollution controls that add $50 to $300 to their price but make them the cleanest internal combustion vehicles in the world, burning the cleanest gasoline. Newcomers from the other 49 states must pay a special $300 smog impact fee to register their cars. A relative handful of perhaps 1,100 experimental electric vehicles dot the freeways, state officials say, and charging stations have sprung up at shopping malls.
The bad news is that day in and day out, pollution levels here are still the worst in the nation, followed by those in Houston and New York, with nearby San Diego's at No. 10. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency has refused to approve the local air district's updated plan for coping with pollution, calling it inadequate. State officials acknowledge that they are well behind the pace needed to meet new Federal air standards by the target date of 2010. They will also be hard-pressed to meet their goal of 10 percent of new vehicles sold being electric, or zero emission, in five years.
"The achievements to date have been remarkable," said Barry R. Wallerstein, the acting executive officer of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the state-chartered agency that oversees the Los Angeles region. "Each of the last three years has been the cleanest year on record. Having said that, we still have a long way to go to have clean, healthful air 365 days a year in Southern California."
The board of the local Air Quality Management District, spurred by the severe regional economic downturn of the early 1990's and by a batch of conservative appointees, has adopted some 30 measures rolling back pollution controls for paints, solvents and other substances and for traffic at shopping malls, airports and concert halls. Last summer, the board ousted James Lents, its executive director for a decade, with some members arguing that he was hostile to business.
The board has yet to name a replacement, but its chairman, William A. Burke, the director of the Los Angeles Marathon, has announced an initiative called "environmental justice," aimed at toughening pollution controls in poor and minority neighborhoods that have often been disproportionately affected.
"I think the jury's still out," said Jane Hall, an environmental economist at California State University at Fullerton who resigned from the agency's advisory board in 1996 to protest the rollbacks in controls. "I think Burke's environmental justice initiative is very encouraging, and he's trying to build some partnerships with industry. But I'm discouraged by the number of times I hear the district say things have gotten so much cleaner, and it's going to be hard to go forward."
Professor Hall's own studies of three decades of pollution control efforts have shown no discernible negative economic effects on even the most heavily regulated sectors. She said the story of the past quarter-century has been that each successive step in pollution control has been declared undoable until regulation pressured industry into coming up with cleaner technologies.
"In the late 80's, when the district passed a regulation on volatile compounds for home barbecues, there was a bumper sticker saying, 'Use a barbecue, go to jail,' " she said. "That was amusing, but in fact the manufacturers came back with much cleaner ways to cook outdoors."
The big challenge, Professor Hall said, is to cope with the expected growth in population and cars now that the California economy is thriving, and to develop regulations for diesel trucks and buses.
Ms. Feuer of the Natural Resources Defense Council said there were still any number of technologically easy -- if politically unpalatable -- steps that could improve air quality, including forcing light trucks, minivans and the popular sport utility vehicles to carry the same smog controls as standard passenger cars. The state Air Resources Board is reviewing such a provision.
"There's still a lot of low-hanging fruit left," Ms. Feuer said.

HEADLINE: As Polls Rise for Ferraro, So Do Expectations for Her Message

SERIES: EARLY STEPS: The Senate Campaign

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, April 15

 BODY:
Geraldine A. Ferraro was sitting with a small group of Democrats in the dusty Onondaga County party headquarters here the other afternoon, handing out poll results attesting to her political strength and recounting the warm reception that she said her return to politics had received from voters and contributors alike. The evidence was overwhelming, Ms. Ferraro asserted, that she was the only Democrat who could defeat Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
James T. Snyder, a Democratic state committee member, waited until Ms. Ferraro finished the 15-minute review of her political credentials before raising a different issue about her candidacy. "I don't mean to make this sound simple," Mr. Snyder said, "but what is your rationale for running? Why should I back you?" 
 Ms. Ferraro paused. It was a question that she has heard more than once in recent days, but after her vigorous description of her political strengths, and her spirited attack on Mr. D'Amato, her response to Mr. Snyder sounded, by comparison, unformed.
"Why I'm running is because I really want to have an impact on what's going on in our country in the next century," she answered. "I really do. I have pictures of my grandchildren here, which I'd be happy to show you. I look at what's happening to them, I look at what's happening in our society, with the enormous difference between haves and have-nots. If we do not start investing now, by the time the have-nots are adults, it's going to be too late."
After three months of raising money from the privacy of her office, Ms. Ferraro's return to the public eye last week, in her first extended campaign outing since announcing her candidacy in January, quickly established two central dynamics of her second attempt to win the Democratic nomination to run against Mr. D'Amato.
The first is that 14 years after she came to national attention, the former candidate for Vice President continues to generate excitement and wide recognition, which accounts for the early dominance in the primary. "I wanted to come to see you," said Neil Miller, 34, a hotel room-service waiter, as Ms. Ferraro emerged from a television taping in Buffalo.
But the second is that Ms. Ferraro has, by early appearances, yet to articulate the kind of crisp and compelling political appeal -- what Mr. Snyder described as a rationale -- that both her Democratic rivals, Mark Green, the New York City Public Advocate, and Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, have attempted to offer for their candidacies.
So far, Ms. Ferraro is surfing across the state with a series of generally uncontroversial pronouncements on health care, the economy and education, taking the safe road preferred by candidates leading in the polls.
It is, to be sure, early in the campaign, when it is not uncommon for candidates to spend more time describing problems than suggesting solutions. And Ms. Ferraro's aides said that she will offer cutting-edge ideas in the months ahead.
Nonetheless, Ms. Ferraro's evident vagueness is raising questions among Democrats about just how adventurous a campaign she intends to run, and whether she will seek to power her candidacy largely with her celebrity. There are some Democrats -- including some sympathetic to her -- who worry about how effective such a strategy would be, both because memories of her four months as a Vice-Presidential candidate have faded since her Senate campaign in 1992 and because she faces a field of opponents well versed in the details of Federal policy.
And Ms. Ferraro still has far less money than Mr. Schumer and Mr. D'Amato, forcing her to divert a good deal of energy to a schedule of fund-raising that requires her to sneak a phone call to a potential contributor at every break in her day.
"The question is, when she gets to a policy debate, will she be able to hold her own?" said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant who is not involved in the Senate race. "The expectation level on her is ridiculous."
Ms. Ferraro has started to lay out what she said will be the general topics of her campaign: the difficulties with New York's economy, its schools and its health care programs. She has embraced such ideas as donating surplus computers for after-school training for students, expanding enterprise zones to encourage development, hiring teachers to reduce class sizes and establishing national standards for schools ("Algebra is algebra is algebra," she told one upstate reporter).
And she repeatedly attacks Mr. D'Amato, describing him as "an embarrassment to the people of New York," mocking his wearing of a pink ribbon as an empty gesture to breast cancer victims, assailing his opposition to abortion rights and describing him as a captive of his financial contributors.
But there are moments, like that afternoon in Syracuse, when her candidacy and campaign seem a work in progress. Asked on a flight back to New York, for example, to delineate differences between herself and Mr. D'Amato, she responded: "I really do believe that Al D'Amato does not belong in the United States Senate. I think he's wrong for the state, but I also think he's wrong for this country, and I want him out of the Senate."
Clutching a copy of USA Today as her aircraft circled through clouds awaiting permission to land at La Guardia Airport, she added: "I don't need to be in the Senate to have people pay attention to me. I don't need it to get special treatment to go to a restaurant or get into a hotel. Last night, I was put in the bridal suite, which was very sweet. People really do take care of me." (She had stayed at the Buffalo Airport Radisson).
"What I need it for is because I really believe I can make a difference -- so that's the difference between me and Al D'Amato," she concluded. "As a Senator, I'm going to love the title, but the title will be secondary to what I have to get done."
Ms. Ferraro, who is 62, has taken some tentative steps to try to distinguish herself from the field, including trying to turn a central criticism -- that she has not been in government since 1985 -- into a political asset.
"My experience is very diverse," she said at Syracuse Law School. "Chuck Schumer has been in public office ever since he got out of law school. He went from Harvard Law School to working as a staff person at the Assembly. Mark has a little more diverse experience. I bring my experience as a New York City public schoolteacher so I can speak to the education system. I bring my experience as an assistant district attorney to criminal justice."
Ms. Ferraro, who has worked as a commentator on CNN, asserted that if elected, she would enjoy an immediate stature in the Senate that her two Democratic opponents, neither of whom has run for Vice President, could not match. "I go down there as a totally different person from anybody else," she said. "They go down as just another guy from the state."
With a wave of her hand, Ms. Ferraro dismissed the suggestion that Mr. Schumer might make a similar claim to instant status, given his nine terms in the House. "Why would he be able to?" she said. "Just because he knows the process?
But for Ms. Ferraro, the more significant difference is less thecandidates' backgrounds or beliefs and more their standing in the polls. "If you take a look at the polls, I'm ahead of both Mark and Chuck by 30 points and 35 points," she said. "I've never been this far ahead of anybody in my entire life. Never! I love it. But then carrying it a step further, I'm the only one who beats Al D'Amato. They both lose to him."
Ms. Ferraro's contention that she would be the strongest nominee -- as a woman, an Italian-American and, of course, as a celebrity -- is largely, though not universally, shared by most Democratic professionals.
That said, Democratic analysts noted that there is little historical evidence that voters make their primary selections based on what will happen in a general election. And there is a risk to Ms. Ferraro's strategy if the polls that she is today trumpeting as evidence of her strength begin to tighten as voters turn their attention to the race, which many Democratic analysts assume will happen.
To this day, Ms. Ferraro believes that she lost the 1992 Senate primary only because of last-minute attacks on her ethics by her Democratic opponents. So it is that at some moments, her candidacy in 1998 seems like an attempt to bring some closure to 1992 -- or, for that matter, to 1984.
"This is it," Ms. Ferraro said. "This is the last time I will do this public service. Ever. If people want me to do it, I will be the best senator going. If they don't want me to it -- I have to tell you, if I had lost that other race fairly, I wouldn't be doing this now. Because I would have felt that the public had talked."

HEADLINE: Giuliani's Plan for Stadiums Uses Tax He Planned to End

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
With charts by his side and his pointer in hand, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed a way yesterday to help finance new stadiums for the New York Yankees and the New York Mets without raising taxes or deepening the city's debt. But his plan left unanswered the more explosive question of where a new Yankee ballpark would be built.
The proposal, which requires City Council approval, calls for the creation of a public corporation that would receive the revenues from the commercial rent tax that is paid by large Manhattan businesses south of 96th Street. 
 The Mayor previously intended to eliminate that tax by June 1, 2001. Now, he said, the tax could be scaled back at a slower rate than originally planned and eliminated possibly in the year 2004.
The Mayor said that his proposal, which he boasted was unlike any other stadium-financing plan in the country, could raise nearly $600 million by the year 2002, and could also be used to build stadiums for professional soccer and football teams. He also emphasized that the money would cover only the city's commitment to the major capital projects; the state and private investors would also be expected to contribute. And in the case of a new Yankee Stadium, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the team's principal owner, would also bear a share of the costs.
Mr. Giuliani declined to offer a formula for cost sharing, saying such arrangements were still being negotiated.
Estimates for the cost of a new stadium range from $600 million to $1 billion.
As the Mayor detailed his plan to a group of reporters, his aides grinned at one another, reflecting the general sense that they had scored a political coup with an approach that would not cost city residents a penny more in direct taxes.
Still, it is likely that the taxes paid by businesses will eventually be passed on to their customers. The 4.5 percent tax now applies to businesses paying $100,000 or more in rent, and the revenues go into the city's general fund.
Staff members later told reporters that Mr. Giuliani had come up with the idea on his own, two weeks before a 500-pound chunk of steel fell from the upper deck of Yankee Stadium last week, forcing a shutdown of the ballpark and the postponement of two games. (The Mayor announced yesterday that the 75-year-old stadium had passed city inspection and would reopen on Friday.)
In sports circles, the plan drew praise for its use of tax money in a way that would not outrage the public. "It sounds to me that if you can hold your nose long enough to get past the fact that it's a tax, it sounds like a creative and appropriate tax to use," said Dean Bonham, president of the Bonham Group, a sports consulting firm in Denver. "It sounds like it only affects the corporate community, and targets them above a certain economic level -- those who can afford it the most."
And Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, which has been lobbying against the commercial rent tax for many years, seemed to accept the price. "It's a terrible tax," he said, and probably the only one of its kind in the country.
"On the other hand, we've gone from 6 to 4.5 percent and expect to go to 3 percent" in the level of taxation, he said. "So it's tough to be really upset about what appears to be a slowing down of the reduction."
But the plan requires the approval of the City Council, whose Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, wants to put the stadium issue to a public vote.
In addition, the Mayor's plans for "how" naturally raised the prickly question of "where." While the Mets are content to build a ballpark next to their 37-year-old home, Shea Stadium, in Queens, the Yankees are clearly eager to leave Yankee Stadium in particular and the Bronx entirely.
Although Mr. Giuliani would prefer that the Yankees remain in the Bronx, he said that a new stadium on the West Side of Manhattan might be the only way to insure that the team remains in New York City. In fact, he made no mention of using his new financing plan to renovate Yankee Stadium, which is generally considered to be a city landmark.
"I really doubt that there is in this room a bigger Yankee fan than I am," the Mayor said, "a person who started going to Yankee Stadium earlier than I did. Romantically and emotionally, I would love to keep the Yankees in the Bronx. At the same time, I have to focus on the fact that we could lose the team. I have to look at the practicalities of that."
But Mr. Giuliani's announcement came at the same time that Mr. Vallone suggested putting the question of a new Yankee Stadium before the voters in a referendum. "I believe that we need to hear from the taxpayers before we sink a billion dollars into a new stadium in Manhattan," he said. "I am committed to doing whatever is necessary and responsible to keep the Yankees in the Bronx."
Given that recent polls show that most New York residents would prefer that the Yankees remain in the Bronx, Mr. Vallone's proposal could be seen as an attempt to dash the Mayor's grandiose plans -- and that is exactly how Mr. Giuliani took it.
"That's sort of the absence of leadership," he said. "In the places that have done that, they've driven their baseball teams away. I mean, you can play that game and it'd be easy to say that, and most people in a public opinion poll probably agree with it. But I got elected to be a leader, not a panderer. And the fact is that I'm not going to see the two teams get driven out of New York."
Speaking as though a plan to build a stadium for the Yankees in Manhattan were a fait accompli, Mr. Giuliani said: "I think you've got to be a leader. I know most of the public disagrees with me. I think 10 years from now they'll say, 'Mayor Giuliani made the right decision.' "
Some aides to the City Council said later that Mr. Giuliani's harsh assessment of Mr. Vallone was politically unwise, given that the Mayor's financing plan requires the Council's blessing. But Thomas McMahon, the Council's Finance Director, said he saw the issue in starker terms, "It's not about financing; it's about location."
At the same time, the Mayor's announcement seemed to catch the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki by surprise. "We have not really heard anything for maybe a year," said Charles A. Gargano, the state's Economic Development Commissioner. Mr. Gargano said that the state would listen to any proposal the city has for a stadium for the Yankees. "But we'd prefer the Yankees stay in their historic home in the Bronx," he said.
Lastly, there arose the question of public policy: Should the city be helping to build baseball stadiums for private owners, or should it be focusing more on the city's infrastructure?
Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a mass-transit advocacy group, said he was not persuaded by the Mayor's argument that new stadiums create jobs and opportunities for the poor.
"My point is that the city's most important capital asset is the subways, and the city's long-term capital commitment to them is widely viewed as inadequate," he said. "And I'm just talking about what I know best."
Yesterday, at least, the Mayor's aides preferred to focus on the originality of their plan. They said that the Mayor made his announcement yesterday, rather than at the unveiling of his Executive Budget on Friday, because of misleading speculation that he planned to raise taxes or sell bonds to finance the stadiums.
Joseph J. Lhota, the city's Budget Director, said that the proposed corporation, to be called the New York City Sports Facilities Corporation, would not have the power to sell bonds; instead, it would simply use the money raised from the commercial-rent tax to help cover construction costs.
Other money would come from the state and from private sources, such as corporations that might buy the rights to the stadiums' names or rent luxury suites.
Mr. Lhota also said that the plan is distinguished from other stadium-funding arrangements in that there would be no debt; everything would be paid for up front. "By the time any one stadium is compete, it will be paid for," he said. "Period."
He also emphasized that the commercial rent tax will still be eliminated. "But instead of eliminating it over the next three years, we're probably going to eliminate it over the next six years, maybe longer, maybe less," he said.
Mr. Giuliani also argued that whether the new stadium for the Yankees is built in Manhattan or the Bronx, the hotels, restaurants and stores of Manhattan all will benefit.
"Where do you think the people stay who come to watch baseball games at Yankee Stadium or Shea Stadium?" he asked. "Where do you think most of them stay?"
The answer, he said, was Manhattan.

Gore and Democrats Honor Deputy Speaker

 BODY:
It was a long way from home for Arthur O. Eve, a Buffalo Democrat. But the Deputy Speaker of the State Assembly made the trip to Manhattan yesterday morning to be lauded for his 31 years in office by a host of his fellow Democrats, most notably Vice President Al Gore.
In a fund-raising breakfast for Mr. Eve at the Sheraton New York hotel, Mr. Gore praised the 65-year-old legislator as a crusader for economic development and education. Mr. Eve, the Vice President said, "is a leader on just about every issue that's important to families." 
 He added: "America needs you to support him and to re-elect him."
The breakfast attracted about 100 guests, including a broad spectrum of business leaders, elected officials, former colleagues from the Assembly and candidates for office this year. They included the hosts of the breakfast, United States Representative Charles B. Rangel, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, and Percy E. Sutton, the former Manhattan Borough President.
Also present were the current Manhattan Borough President, C. Virginia Fields; Mark J. Green, the city's Public Advocate, who is a candidate for the United States Senate, and James L. Larocca, who is a candidate for governor.
Mr. Eve was cited by elected officials yesterday for his role in leading a committee of public officials who attempted to resolve a conflict between prison guards and inmates after a 1971 uprising at the Attica State Prison.
He was also cited for his role as a founding member of the New York State Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus, of which he was once the chairman.
Yesterday's fund-raiser was expected to bring in about $50,000 for Mr. Eve's campaign coffers.

HEADLINE: Chase and Citicorp Report Higher First-Quarter Profits

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Chase Manhattan Corporation and Citicorp reported higher first-quarter earnings yesterday, led by trading and corporate banking, while big regional banks such as the Banc One Corporation and Wells Fargo & Company said fee income strengthened results. All met or beat estimates.
Chase, the biggest domestic bank by assets, said profit from operations rose 11 percent. Citicorp, which is merging with Travelers Group Inc. to become the biggest financial services company, said net income rose 7 percent. 
 Banc One's earnings surged 36 percent. Earnings at Wells Fargo fell 7 percent because of a decline in loans and deposits that offset the effects of higher fee income. Two other large regional banks, the Wachovia Corporation and the Mellon Bank Corporation, also reported healthy gains.
Chase and Citicorp benefited from booming stock and bond markets and from the expanding United States economy. Their underwriting and trading fees rose, as did revenue from arranging corporate loans and selling them to other investors.
The results drew a mixed reaction in the stock market. Shares of Chase rose $4.4375, to $139.125; Citicorp increased $2.25, to $160.25; Banc One fell $1.4375, to $58.8125, and Wells Fargo declined $7, to $375.
Chase said profit from operations increased to $1.05 billion, or $2.35 a diluted share, from $949 million, or $2.02, a year earlier. The latest results beat the average forecast of $2.26 a share, based on a survey of analysts by the First Call Corporation, which tracks corporate earnings results.
Noninterest revenue at Chase increased 19 percent, to $2.47 billion. Trading revenue advanced 23 percent, to $713 million, and revenue from equity investments increased 75 percent, to $287 million. Credit card revenue rose 17 percent, to $931 million.
Net interest income rose 4.3 percent, to $2.16 billion. Chase increased its loan-loss provision to $344 million, from $220 million in the period a year ago. Net income at Chase totaled $725 million in the quarter, after a $320 million charge to cut 4,500 jobs, or 6.5 percent of its staff, in a previously announced cost-reduction plan.
Citicorp earned $1.07 billion, or $2.23 a diluted share, up from $995 million, or $2.01. Analysts surveyed by First Call had expected the bank to earn $2.22 a diluted share.
Net interest revenue increased 1.2 percent, to $2.84 billion, as net interest expense rose 13 percent, to $3.46 billion. It raised its credit losses provision 20 percent, to $507 million.
Noninterest revenue rose 16 percent, to $2.77 billion. Securities transactions revenue more than doubled, to $241 million from $108 million, and trading account revenue was up 19 percent, to $236 million. Venture capital gains almost tripled, to $264 million from $93 million.
Net income at Banc One rose to $517.6 million, or 79 cents a diluted share, from $381.9 million, or 58 cents, in the period a year earlier. That matched the estimate from analysts surveyed by First Call.
Last week, Banc One agreed to acquire the First Chicago NBD Corporation in a merger valued at $30 billion. The combined company, which would be based in Chicago, would be the fifth-largest United States bank.
Wells Fargo earned $315 million, or $3.58 a diluted share, down from $339 million, or $3.58 a share. That beat the average forecast by analysts of $3.41.

Treasury Prices Decrease as Several Corporations Issue Debt

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities prices fell yesterday amid a flood of new debt from corporate issuers drawn by low interest rates. Among the new supply was $3.25 billion of bonds priced yesterday by the Ford Motor Credit Company, its biggest global issue ever.
Treasuries also came under pressure from remarks by a Federal Reserve governor, Roger Ferguson, who suggested that an increase in interest rates might be in the offing if the Asian financial crisis did not slow the United States economy. 
 The 30-year Treasury was off 10/32, to a price of 102 15/32
Treasury Prices Decrease as Several Corporations Issue Debt. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, was 5.95 percent, up from 5.92 percent Monday.
Prices recovered after steeper drops early in the session. Often when big corporate deals come to the market, underwriters hedge their portfolios by selling Treasury securities to protect against a rise in interest rates before the corporate sales are complete. At that point, the underwriters often repurchase Treasuries for their portfolios.
Strong demand for the Ford Motor Credit securities allowed the company to increase the size of the issue from its initial plans. The amount of five-year notes was raised by $750 million, to $2.25 billion. The notes sold at a price to yield 6.17 percent -- about 55 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point -- more than the rate of a Treasury note with a comparable maturity.
The underwriters, led by Salomon Smith Barney and Bear, Stearns & Company, also priced $1 billion of seven-year floating-rate notes for an initial yield of 5.885 percent, which will be adjusted quarterly to 18.75 basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The Libor is a benchmark interest rate that international banks charge each other for loans denominated in dollars. Late in the day the three-month Libor was about 5.69 percent.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., said he was surprised that such a large offering was increased, reflecting strong investor demand.
"There's a lot of liquidity out there for corporate debt," he said. "So all the corporate paper is having a dampening effect on Treasury prices."
The success of Ford's offering was also helped by the fact that the company is a household name and that the spread of the yield compared with that of a comparable Treasury was attractive, Mr. Pugliese said. "Credit ratings are important, but it was the name that attracted buyers globally," he said.
Earlier this year investors were wary of buying corporate debt, not knowing how much the Asian turmoil might affect earnings and credit quality. But the United States economy is still humming along and inflation is not a threat, making corporate paper, which offers a higher yield to Treasury securities, attractive to many investors.
But the strength of the economy has also raised concerns about inflation and about whether the Fed will move to head it off by raising interest rates.

U.S. Deficit in March Lower Than Forecast

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21

 BODY:
The United States posted a smaller than expected budget deficit in March as the growing economy helped the Government reap tax dollars -- keeping Washington on course for the first annual surplus since the 1969 fiscal year.
March's deficit totaled $13.813 billion, compared with a deficit of $21.3 billion in March 1997, Treasury figures showed. Analysts had expected a deficit of $14.6 billion last month. 
 March revenue rose 9.1 percent, to $117.93 billion, from a year earlier. Spending rose 1.8 percent from a year earlier, to $131.743 billion.
The strong economy, stock market and efforts to slow Federal spending all pointed to an annual surplus. The White House projects a $10 billion surplus this year, though some analysts say it could be larger.
Since the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1, the budget deficit has totaled $69.862 billion, down from the corresponding period the fiscal year before, when the deficit was running $111.162 billion.
The budget deficit now amounts to less than 1 percent of the gross domestic product, the smallest slice of the overall economy since 1974 and the smallest percentage among major industrial nations.
Still, the Treasury reports a deficit most months because it spends more money than it receives and borrows the rest. Surpluses usually come in January, April, June, September, and more recently in December, coinciding with tax payments.

Philip Morris Posts 6% Rise In Earnings

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Philip Morris Companies said yesterday that earnings rose 6 percent in the first quarter, as it sold more than half the cigarettes in the United States for the first time, even though it raised prices to pay for legal costs.
Philip Morris, the world's largest cigarette company, said net income rose to $1.87 billion, or 77 cents a diluted share, from $1.77 billion, or 72 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2.3 percent, to $18.4 billion from $18.0 billion. Earnings rose 9 percent, to 79 cents a share, matching analysts' expectations, before a charge to pay for a voluntary retirement program at its United States tobacco business. 
 Nonetheless, the company's shares fell 62.5 cents, to $39.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Philip Morris's cigarette sales in the United States rose 2.1 percent, helped by new Marlboro Ultra Lights, allowing the company to capture 50.4 percent of the market. At the same time, industry sales fell almost 2 percent over all, showing that Philip Morris may do better than competitors even if it continues to raise cigarette prices to pay for legislation being considered by Congress.
"They're best positioned for the vagaries of Congress," said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. who has a "buy" rating on Philip Morris's shares. "They're larger and they have Marlboro," the world's No. 1 cigarette.
Full-priced cigarette brands like Marlboro cost about $2.15 a pack at the end of the first quarter, up from about $2.10 a pack in December, analysts said. The extra revenue from increased prices can be put toward the tobacco industry's legal settlements. Philip Morris is responsible for paying about half of about $30 billion over 25 years in three settlements of health-related suits brought by Texas, Florida and Mississippi. Philip Morris and other tobacco companies may raise prices even more, depending on the outcome of Congressional talks on a nationwide tobacco settlement.
International tobacco unit sales rose 4.7 percent and operating profit rose 11 percent, to $1.4 billion, even as weaker economies in Asia reduced demand.
The company's Kraft North America unit had operating profit of $802 million, up 9.6 percent, largely as it cut costs. The company said it posted double-digit unit sales gains in its Tombstone and Di Giorno frozen pizza businesses as well as its Taco Bell and Kraft Macaroni and Cheese home meals.
Profit from the company's international food business fell 2.9 percent, to $235 million, largely because of lower coffee sales and the effect of the strong dollar.
Profit from Miller Brewing, the second-largest brewer in America, rose 1.6 percent, to $128 million, on slightly higher shipments.

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON with Matthew J. Rosenberg 

 BODY:

A Coup for N.Y.U.
New York University appears to have succeeded where Columbia University failed. N.Y.U. is stealing a high-ranking professor from Harvard University. DR. ROBERT M. GLICKMAN, who has been a professor at Harvard Medical School and physician-in-chief and chairman of the department of medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston for nine years, will become the new dean of the N.Y.U. medical school this summer.
Word that Dr. Glickman had accepted the N.Y.U. job came a week after ROBERT J. BARRO, a Harvard economist, backed out of a deal to teach at Columbia for a salary almost unheard-of among academics: $300,000 a year. Dr. Glickman, a gastroenterologist who was the chairman of the department of medicine at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons from 1982 to 1990, would not say how much N.Y.U. had offered him. 
 "Was money the thing that lured me?" he said. "The answer is no. It's really not a money thing."
It was, he said, "a leadership thing." At 59, he wanted to step up on the administrative ladder, and he realized that he would probably not be offered the top job at Harvard Medical School: he was a member of the search committee that chose Dr. Joseph Martin for that post a year ago.
"I never thought of it in that way," Dr. Glickman said yesterday. "But you have a certain amount of energy and excitement and this feeling you want to make something significant happen."
 
Blue Plate Special
Only 22 days are left for New York to cash in on the phenomenon known as "Seinfeld," the sitcom about New York that was videotaped in California. In the race for last-minute tie-ins, Maxim, an upstart men's magazine, has snagged a prize: it rented Tom's Restaurant, the quintessential Noo-Yawky coffee shop that inspired the generic one on "Seinfeld," for May 14, the night of the sitcom's final episode.
Maxim sent out plates as invitations -- 150 specially made silver-rimmed plates with a picture of Tom's and its blue and pink-neon sign, the view millions of "Seinfeld" watchers know from the show.
The fancy lettering promises that the evening will feature drinks and "yadda, yadda, yadda."
PAM COHEN, a spokeswoman for Maxim, said the magazine is paying Tom's "a low five-figure number" to have "the ultimate 'Seinfeld' farewell party" there.
 
A Civilized Refusal
MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI may or may not like journalists, but he does not want to be one. Civilization magazine said the Mayor had turned down an offer to be the guest editor of its June/ July issue.
The magazine then turned to the cartoonist JULES FEIFFER, who agreed to oversee that issue and suggested that Mr. Giuliani contribute a "personal appreciation" of the jut-jawed crime fighter Dick Tracy.
But NANCY SHEED, a spokeswoman for Civilization, said a Giuliani aide had told the magazine that no one at City Hall knew enough about Dick Tracy to write an appreciation. (CURT RITTER, a spokesman for the Mayor, said that Mr. Giuliani could not squeeze in a guest-editing stint, but looked forward to working with Civilization at some point in the future.)
The current guest editor has given the Civilization staff some sleepless nights in the last few days: VACLAV HAVEL, the president of the Czech Republic, underwent two operations last week while the issue he guided was being printed. "He's had lung cancer," Ms. Sheed said, "and he's on the cover smoking a cigarette."
 
Shoes and Shows
DONALD SELIGMAN, who ran a midtown store that sold Pappagallo shoes in the 1960's, was a kind of Medici for the aspiring singers he hired as part-time sales clerks. "It began with these three girls who kept saying how good they were and that they couldn't get a break," he said. "So I rented out Carnegie Recital Hall to see if they were as a good as they said," he said. "I figured it would keep them quiet."
It didn't, he said at a reunion of former clerks at the Cornell Club. Soon they were holding recitals at the store, on East 54th Street.
"It was a great place for us," said the soprano RUTH FALCON. "You could call and say, 'I can't make it in today, I've got an audition,' and it was not a problem."
And what about celebrities who shopped there? "Greta Garbo came in once and tried on a pillbox hat, the kind that Jackie Onassis wore and was all the rage then," said NANCY KILMER. "She kind of looked in the mirror, tipped that hat, and began to laugh."
 
Quote, End Quote
"I think there are some awards that if you don't show up, you don't get, but fortunately, the Lortel is a classier outfit," said the actress CHERRY JONES, explaining why she will attend the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund dinner on May 4, not the Lucille Lortel Awards the same night.
"Finally I said to her, 'You're up on your beautiful appaloosa stallion. It's a fine spring day. We're riding through the woods. The bluebells are all out, and the sky is clear blue,' " said PAUL McCARTNEY, describing how his wife, Linda, died. "I had barely got to the end of the sentence when she closed her eyes."

HEADLINE: City Study Sees Big Revenues If Yankees Play in Manhattan

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
In yet another sign that the Giuliani administration sees Manhattan as the future home of the New York Yankees, a new study by city planners suggests that a new stadium on the West Side would have an economic impact worth at least $1 billion a year, more than 10 times the impact of a renovated or new stadium in the Bronx.
The numbers in the report are so lopsided, in fact, that a high-ranking aide to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani felt compelled to say that economic impact was only one of many factors being weighed by the Mayor in addressing one of the most vexing challenges of his administration: how to keep the Yankees in New York City without forsaking the Bronx, a borough whose identity is inextricably linked to the ball club. 
 Having said that, the aide also acknowledged that the report might help to temper the considerable opposition that is likely to arise if a ball park is built above a rail yard near 11th Avenue and 33d Street. "There's a clear preference on the part of the Mayor and the city to keep the Yankees in the Bronx," said the aide, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity. "If that can be done, that's the goal. But that doesn't change the economic calculus."
Mr. Giuliani has not decided how to respond to the standing threat of the Yankees' principal owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, to move his team out of the Bronx -- and New York, if necessary -- once its Yankee Stadium lease expires in 2002. But the tenor of the Mayor's comments in recent days suggests that while his heart is in the Bronx, his thoughts have turned to Manhattan.
And that was clear again yesterday when Mr. Giuliani responded to reporters' questions about his proposal to use the commercial-rent tax -- assessed against large businesses south of 96th Street in Manhattan -- to cover the city's share of costs to build stadiums for the Yankees and the New York Mets.
"This spending will result in, bare minimum, at least $1 billion more for our economy and thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs," Mr. Giuliani said. "We need those jobs. And particularly those who are worried about unemployment and the change from welfare to work, we need a city that has a constantly expanding set of jobs. And I would think that those people who are trying to block this -- all of whom come out of the political philosophy that drove jobs out of the city -- would actually have some deference to the plans that we have."
But some experts say cities should be wary of of overestimating the financial impact of sports stadiums, in part because such vagaries as the economy and a team's performance cannot be predicted.
"Most economists agree that stadium deals are awful as economic development projects," said David Swindell, a professor of urban affairs at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. "You lose every time. The public spends far more money creating this private business venture than it'd give back to the public treasury.
"A professional sports team is the equivalent of two Wal-Marts in terms of the economy," he added.
The report, which was conducted by the city's planning and economic-development departments with participation by several consultants, said that a West Side stadium with a grass field and no retractable dome would draw 3.9 million people a year to 81 Yankee home games and to a dozen nonsporting events -- more than 1 million more people than Yankee Stadium currently attracts -- and could be expected to spur the development of two 600-room hotels, 600,000 square feet of office space and various stores and restaurants. Combined, the stadium and the related development would create 9,442 jobs and generate nearly $42 million in new taxes, the report said.
The numbers would increase slightly if the West Side stadium included artificial turf and a retractable dome, the report said, because it could be used for more concerts, revival meetings and other events.
But if a new stadium were built on or near the current site in the Bronx, the report said, the economic impact would be drastically smaller. It estimated that 255,000 square feet of the surrounding area could be developed as a result, generating 1,200 jobs, about $3.3 million in taxes, and an overall economic impact of $92.6 million. The report said that the Bronx neighborhood surrounding Yankee Stadium lent itself only to a "modest level of induced real estate development." But a very cautious analysis, it said, suggests that the West Side is wide open and ripe for investment. "A new stadium, with links to both Madison Square Garden and the Javits Center, will anchor a new entertainment-commercial core of Manhattan that includes the new Penn Station," the report said.
But the document also said that at least $300 million would also have to be spent to improve the West Side's "transportation and infrastructure," although it did not elaborate on what "infrastructure" it was referring to. Such improvements, it added, would also support the expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
The enormous gap between the estimates for the Bronx and Manhattan, the senior mayoral aide said, is integral to any discussion about justifying the use of public money for such a venture. "The key question is, what is the result of that investment?" the aide said.
The report -- written by Joseph B. Rose, the planning director, and Charles Millard, the director of economic development -- did not explain in detail the methodology used, a point seized upon by Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, who has criticized Mr. Giuliani for even entertaining the thought of smoothing the way for a Yankee exodus from the Bronx.
"This is not exactly Holy Writ," Mr. Ferrer said. "It's more like making up these numbers as we go along. They're just making their boss happy."

HEADLINE: Stock Exchange Weighs Move to Battery Park City

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Applying new pressure in its bid to expand in lower Manhattan, the New York Stock Exchange has told city officials that it is prepared to leave its historic headquarters on Wall Street and move to a new building in Battery Park City.
For several months officials of the exchange have told the city that they want to acquire three buildings across Broad Street from the exchange's existing -- and very cramped -- trading floors at the corner of Wall Street, which they would tear down and replace with newly enlarged trading operations. 
 But according to mayoral aides, Richard Grasso, the president of the exchange, told Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani at a meeting last week that a new building in Battery Park City was now being considered because the legal and financial barriers to acquiring the Broad Street properties could take too long to resolve at a time when the exchange was desperate to expand.
The aides said the Mayor and Mr. Grasso did not discuss the tax breaks that the exchange is almost certain to get for its expansion, no matter which site it chooses, but officials say the amount is likely to be substantial. Last year, for example, the New York Mercantile Exchange received $168 million in incentives when it moved to a new headquarters in Battery Park City.
Which of the two locations the exchange really favors was unclear yesterday, and its overture to City Hall may have been calculated to gain leverage in its negotiations with Broad Street property owners or possibly to push the state to consider condemnation of the buildings. But aides to both the Mayor and Gov. George E. Pataki said without reservation yesterday that they wanted the exchange to remain where it is.
"Both the Mayor and the Governor prefer that the exchange remain in the Wall Street area," said Randy Levine, the Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, who said that last week's meeting was one of several that Mr. Grasso and the Mayor have had since the exchange began its effort to expand a year ago.
But Mr. Levine said the Mayor considered a new exchange building in Battery Park City to be an acceptable second choice if terms could not be reached quickly in the exchange's attempt to acquire the Broad Street properties. Although the potential bargaining positions of the Broad Street property owners remain unclear, one of the owners is known to look unfavorably on a proposed deal. "The key is to keep them downtown, and I think we have accomplished that," Mr. Levine said.
Officials of the exchange declined comment on the meeting with the Mayor, saying only that they had no alternative but to find more room for their growing trading floors and that they planned to make a decision soon on where that would be.
"We can only confirm that there are ongoing discussions with the city and we expect to make a decision in the coming months," said Richard Adamonis, an exchange spokesman. He declined to be more specific about the timing of the decision.
John LaMura, the president of the Battery Park City Authority, said that neither he nor other officials had been contacted about the stock exchange proposal.
The Battery Park City site proposed by the exchange would be just north of the main towers of the World Financial Center and northeast of the New York Mercantile Exchange, which was completed last year.
A decision to move to Battery Park City could be expected to provoke political tension, both for the exchange and the Mayor, since it could undermine the city's ambitious plan to revitalize the Wall Street area with more housing, residential services and businesses.
"The loss of the exchange would obviously be a blow to the area," said one executive in lower Manhattan who spoke on condition of anonymity. But at City Hall, an official close to the discussions, who also insisted on anonymity, said some form of backfill, including the offices of city agencies, might fill the economic void at the traditional core of the city's financial district.
Since it began its effort to expand, the exchange has encountered repeated roadblocks. Its most ambitious plan was to build a glass-enclosed atrium from its current trading floors across Broad Street to a landmarked city building, greatly expanding its existing space.
That proposal was dropped after fierce resistance from preservationists. An earlier plan, to build a pedestrian walkway high above Broad Street that would connect the existing exchange building with another landmark structure, was dropped because of worries over terrorism and other security concerns.
The exchange's proposal to acquire and tear down properties across Broad Street would not include any structures with landmark status.
But among the three buildings, officials point to one that would be the most difficult for the exchange to acquire: a former office tower at 25 Broad Street that became one of the first examples of the Mayor's plan to revitalize the Wall Street area last year when it was converted to 340 luxurious apartments.
Russell W. Galbut, the president of Crescent Heights Investors, a Miami development concern that owns 25 Broad Street and spent $100 million on its conversion, declined comment yesterday when contacted at the company's office in Atlanta.
But an executive close to the company and its Broad Street project said it had not been approached by Mr. Grasso or other stock exchange officials.
One option for the exchange if the owners of any of the three Broad Street properties refused to sell would be the seek the help of Governor Pataki in having their property condemned. But that approach could backfire -- as was demonstrated in the state's arduous 10-year effort to condemn property in Times Square, which succeeded only after dozens of lawsuits were resolved.

HEADLINE: The Rush to Finance Stadiums

 BODY:
Baseball fans and New Yorkers who appreciate the place the Yankees and Mets occupy in lore and in the city's social history wholeheartedly support Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's goal of insuring that both remain within the city limits. But the method the Mayor selected to signal that desire on Monday is quite worrisome. His plan to open the city's tax vaults and place nearly $600 million in commercial rent tax revenue on the negotiating table for stadium financing is premature. It could also damage the city's bargaining position with club owners. More important, there is no immutable law that says stadium financing deals must be heavily sweetened with public subsidies or taxpayer support in any form.
In San Francisco, the Giants have chosen to finance a new baseball stadium with more than $200 million from private-sector sources and only a sprinkling of city aid, a minuscule $10 million. New York's list of pressing infrastructure needs -- schools and rapid transit come immediately to mind -- is quite long and expensive. The Mayor and the teams should adopt the San Francisco ethic: The teams should first exploit the myriad financing sources in the private sector. Indeed, some of them -- luxury boxes, stadium naming rights, charter seats -- flow from lucrative aspects of remodeled or new stadiums. What better place to craft such deals than Manhattan, the epicenter of world finance? 
 The Mayor's scenario for subsidies is politically artful. Rather than mimicking cities that have saddled taxpayers with new debt or higher regressive taxes, he would draw revenue from an existing city tax on large Manhattan businesses, albeit one that is being phased out at a molasses-like pace. His proposed stadium finance corporation would siphon off about $600 million in tax revenues in its first four years and $300 million a year thereafter, as long as it had projects to pursue. The open-ended nature of all this does not augur well for other city needs.
Last week's falling-beam incident at Yankee Stadium rekindled interest in its future and in the plans of the club's principal owner, George Steinbrenner. In public, Mr. Steinbrenner has been Sphinx-like. He should state what his club wants now, not when the city lease expires in 2002. Without that, financing talk is academic. It leaves the city negotiating against itself. Although the proposed financing could be used for construction or renovations anywhere in the city, the Mayor's comments about a possible Yankee Stadium on the West Side of Manhattan suggest the real danger of a premature decision to abandon the Bronx.
Nationwide, decision-making about stadiums is frequently messy and irrational, as a recent comprehensive Brookings Institution study of stadium financing and economics shows. More often than not, the value of publicly subsidized financing is distorted and the economic impact touted by proponents rarely materializes. If and when it is time to discuss public dollars as part of any stadium deal, including infrastructure-related spending, the choices made by the Mayor, the City Council and New Yorkers should abide by the following principle: A public subsidy should be commensurate with real, not imagined, public benefits.

HEADLINE: Doctors' Pay Regains Ground Despite the Effects of H.M.O.'s

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

 BODY:
The nation's physicians still complain that managed care organizations drown them in paperwork and meddle with their prerogatives in treating patients. But their fears for their own livelihoods, that managed care would reduce their wages or drive them out of medicine, are proving overdrawn.
Doctors' incomes have rebounded from the nearly 4 percent decline four years ago that was reported by the American Medical Association in early 1996. That decrease was widely attributed to the impact of managed care. A survey of 1996 incomes, which was reported just last month, showed physicians' average earnings rising to the threshold of $200,000 for the first time. 
 That is $18,000, or almost 10 percent, more than in 1994, and $70,000, or about 50 percent, more than in 1987, when managed care was just beginning to spread; it is a rate of increase surpassing the gains of most other working Americans. Consulting firms' less comprehensive surveys for this year and last show physician incomes stabilizing or slightly rising. When inflation is taken into account, doctors are little better off than they were a decade ago.
"If you're well-trained and don't have something lurking in your past, you can make a pretty darn good living," said Dr. William L. Mason, a pulmonologist and internist in Little Rock, Ark. "The question physicians have to ask themselves now is, 'How much do I want to make?' Medicine never promised to make us millionaires."
To be sure, doctors aren't realizing the 10 percent annual gains in income they sometimes saw in the old days of fee-for-service medicine, when they could essentially bill compliant insurance companies whatever they wished for care. The managed care revolution has clearly taken hold, forcing doctors to justify their services, negotiate their fees and learn the bookkeeping and accounting tools that are anathema to many.
Among the specialties, income changes have often been volatile. Anesthesiologists and pathologists have suffered acute declines in income and are only now seeing them recover somewhat.
Dr. Richard F. Corlin, a gastroenterologist in Santa Monica, Calif., and speaker of the A.M.A.'s House of Delegates, says that doctors are working exceptionally long hours to maintain their incomes and that the marketplace remains "'extremely volatile."
However, he said, it is short-sighted for physicians to look at themselves as victims, because their prospects remain promising. "I'd give one of my paired organs to any of my three sons who wanted to go into medicine," he said.
David Gans, survey director at the Medical Group Management Association in Denver, which represents 183,000 members of 9,000 physician groups, said, "I've not yet seen a physician on a street corner with a sign saying, 'Will do surgery for food.' They are working harder, but there's virtually zero unemployment among doctors."
Part of this rebound, recruiters and industry consultants say, is a big change in the relationships among the institutions that compete and collaborate in providing care.
Health maintenance organizations, they say, have reached the limit in hammering down costs, and physicians, who like many patients depict themselves as victims of managed care, are banding together into big, multispecialty groups, attempting to recapture the control of the health care system, which they lost to H.M.O.'s.
Consultants and physician recruiters add that predictions of an oversupply of physicians, fed by immigration of foreign doctors and by managed care organizations' use of nurse practitioners for some physicians' services, is, at worst, some years off.
Young specialists, they say, must often look for work beyond the doctor-glutted meccas of medicine, like New York, Boston and San Diego, but they all find work. One good prospect is Kaiser Permanente, the nation's biggest nonprofit health maintenance organization, with hospitals and clinics in 18 states.
"We have to hire 1,200 physicians just to meet the growth of 1997 and 1998 in California," said Dr. Francis J. Crosson, executive director of Kaiser's physician organization.
Paul R. Dorf, director of the Hospital and Healthcare Compensation Service in Upper Saddle River, N.J., said of the physician marketplace, "Frankly, I think it's going to get better." Mr. Dorf, who is an industry consultant, added, "Is there turmoil? Yes. But are physicians going to be poor? I don't think so."
For a decade, health maintenance organizations and the insurance companies that own many of them were able to rein in the cost of care by cutting the fees they paid physicians to treat their enrollees and by denying patients services that they deemed excessive or unnecessary.
Physicians lost some of their autonomy and had to work harder to make ends meet, seeing more patients during shorter visits. Only those with reliable stables of rich patients could shun H.M.O.'s and survive.
But in many states, and particularly in California, Minnesota and Massachusetts, physicians have begun turning the tables on H.M.O.'s.
They equip their new provider-sponsored organizations with testing laboratories and operating rooms for same-day surgery and strike alliances with hospitals for longer term care. Then they devise procedures for managing the cost of care, typically by paying group members bonuses or other incentives for keeping patients healthy and satisfied.
Thus organized, the physician groups compete head-to-head with H.M.O.'s in bidding for contracts to cover workers. The big California Public Employees Retirement System says it is looking into leapfrogging H.M.O.'s and contracting directly with physicians' groups to treat the state's 340,000 employees.
Other employers are considering delegating all patient-care responsibilities to the groups and using H.M.O.'s only to handle bookkeeping, marketing and other administrative tasks for health care programs.
Such a shift in power poses a special threat to the nation's predominantly for-profit health organizations, which are owned by stockholders. Those organizations must charge enough for their services to cover the cost of care and pay dividends to stockholders. One sign of a shift is the H.M.O. industry's financial losses last year, the first ever, and the recovery of physicians' incomes, which include fees, salaries and bonuses.
"Physicians are getting smarter," said Daniel Zismer, health practices specialist at the Towers Perrin consulting firm. "When they aggregate in large group practices, their business opportunities expand exponentially."
In offering services that no solo practitioner can afford, Mr. Zismer said, "their revenues and incomes expand." Dr. Corlin of the A.M.A. said, "What we are going to see is, for-profit H.M.O.s will be gone."
The H.M.O.'s see their prospects as less ominous but still see big changes. Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, which represents 1,000 of the organizations, says a major transformation" in health care, driven by the reduction of cost, is over. She sees new efficiencies arising from collaboration among physicians and the plans to improve the quality of care, which often means less expensive care in the long run.
The worst-case fears for physicians, in short, seem far less justified than they did two years ago, when the A.M.A. reported the first decline in doctors' incomes in the 14 years it had been keeping track.
For several years, the gains in physicians' incomes have been pronounced among internists, family practitioners, pediatricians and gynecologists. Roberta Margolis, senior vice president of Weatherby Health Care, a recruiting firm in Norwalk, Conn., that last year found jobs for 1,088 doctors, most of them primary-care physicians, said, "No bleeding hearts are needed here."
"They are making good money," Ms. Margolis said. "We know they are going to do fabulously." She said obstetrician-gynecologists, whom the A.M.A. found in a study last year to be fully employed, are taking jobs in New York state this year at a salary of $145,000, or $13,000 more than last year, and at $150,000 in Massachusetts, an increase of $16,000.
Among the Weatherby firms's clients is Dr. Tracey Davenport, a graduate of Wellesley College and of the medical school at Southern Illinois University. Now completing her residency in internal medicine at the Bay State Medical Center in Springfield, Mass., Dr. Davenport has signed on with a 60-physician practice in New Bedford, Mass., for an annual salary of $110,000.
Dr. Davenport said she could have picked nearly anyplace in America to work, but was drawn to New Bedford, in part, because of its proximity to the sea. In some ways, managed care will intrude. "Thursday is paperwork day," she said. "And I think it's going to be a lot of hard work and long hours."
But she is sanguine about the issue that doctors rail about most -- green-eye-shade intrusions into her professional prerogatives. "What they're looking for is good medical care," she said. "I've been told it's up to me how much time a patient will need."
The picture is murkier for some specialized physicians and for older doctors still toiling in solo practices. A survey of salaried physicians completed this month by the Hay Group, a management consultant, shows income trends ranging from a slight decline of less than 1 percent in dermatologists' incomes during the last three years, to $166,500, and a 15 percent increase in the incomes of orthopedic surgeons, to $273,500. Incomes of cardiovascular surgeons, the best paid of the major specialities, rose 7 percent, to $363,300.
While physicians can find work, recruiters say a urologist or a pulmonologist, unlike more widely sought primary-care doctors, might have to settle for Syracuse, N.Y., or Utica, N.Y., instead of physician-glutted Manhattan. But even then, there's a silver lining: Recruiters report that doctors earn more in smaller communities than they can in nation's big urban centers of medicine.
"You're always going to have to pay someone extra to go to Minot, N.D., said Mr. Dorf, the consultant.
Andrew P. Diffenbaugh, a recruiter in Norfolk, Va., who specializes in psychiatry, said a psychiatrist who insists on a job in Norfolk will earn $110,000 but if he moves south to the Army town of Fayetteville, N.C., he said, "he'll get $160,000."

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Loans to Rights Violators Are Attacked in Congress

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21

 BODY:
Every year, the State Department's human rights report dwells at length on Indonesia's many forms of political repression, from its use of torture and killings to silence dissenters to its widespread military control of East Timor.
So Indonesia's record might appear, at first glance, to require the use of a law compelling the United States to vote against lending billions of dollars through the International Monetary Fund to gross violators of human rights. But the United States favored a $40-billion I.M.F. bailout of Indonesia, and even offered to throw in $3 billion of back-up American financing if Indonesia needs more. 
 Today, defending that decision during two hours of hostile questioning by a Congressional committee, Treasury Department officials asserted that in the pantheon of human rights violators the Government of President Suharto did not rank among the worst of the worst.
"The State Department makes these judgments, and Indonesia did not meet the standard to be on the list they send us," Timothy F. Geithner, an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, said in testimony today, as he urged Congress to approve an additional $18 billion for the monetary fund.
The debate over providing additional funding has turned into one of the hottest foreign policy issues on Capitol Hill this year. It has become a magnet for human rights activists, abortion opponents and critics of the monetary fund's role as the world's lender of last resort.
The testimony today called into question whether the Administration, in its race to contain the Asian financial crisis, skirted a law that requires the United States to use its "voice and vote" to deny assistance to countries that "engage in a pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights."
The State Department insists that it keeps no official list of human rights violators that should be denied such loans. But, responding to questions today, Mr. Geithner said there were five countries that the United States would likely oppose for such aid: China, Sudan, Equatorial Guinea, Iran and Mauritania.
"I concede," one senior Administration official said, "that to the uninitiated it is a bit of a strange list."
Clearly, it has a number of gaping holes. For example, Nigeria, a country that has seen widespread violence and political repression since a 1993 coup, would not be automatically denied American support. Nor would Iraq, which is barred from borrowing money from the I.M.F. because it has not repaid loans for the last eight years.
At the hearing before the House Banking subcommittee on general oversight and investigations, Representative Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who ranks among the fiercest critics of the monetary fund in the House, charged that the Administration violated the law. "You are funding a vicious dictator who jails his opponents," he said. "It seems to me you very clearly disobeyed the law."
Mr. Geithner and Karin Lissakers, the United States representative to the monetary fund, insisted that the Administration, working behind the scenes, has used its influence to promote both human rights and labor rights. It has blocked the I.M.F. from considering loans to Iran and the Sudan, they said, and held up money for Croatia while it was harboring war criminals.
The human rights argument is part of a broader examination of the workings of the fund that has never before taken place in Congress. The fund is known for its secretiveness, in large part because it offers confidential advice to its 182 member countries, many of which turn over sensitive economic data to the fund.
But that secretiveness has also made it difficult for the United States to defend its support of the fund, or discuss specific decisions. Now, increasingly fearful that the funding it seeks could be denied, Washington has begun to turn over thousands of pages of data about its interactions with the fund.
Each disclosure, though, has raised new objections. Some Republicans argue that the I.M.F. should not provide below-market-rate loans to recipient countries; Mr. Sanders argued the opposite today, maintaining that the fund has turned into a "loan shark" burdening deeply indebted countries with even more interest payments.

HEADLINE: U.N. Panel Defeats U.S. Move to Censure Cuba on Human Rights

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, April 21

 BODY:
An effort led by the United States to rebuke Cuba for its human rights practices was voted down today by the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
The defeat appears to reflect a growing sentiment, particularly among Europeans and Latin Americans, that Cuba cannot be isolated forever and that it is making efforts to meet its international human rights obligations. 
 The United States-sponsored resolution called on Havana to "promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms" and to "release numerous persons detained for activities of a political nature."
Nineteen countries voted against the proposal -- including China and Russia -- and 16, including the United States, Britain, France and Germany, voted in favor. Another 18 members, including many Latin American countries, abstained.
"This vote has repaired a historic mistake and has ended selective and disciminatory treatment against us," Maria de los Angeles Florez, Cuba's chief delegate, said after the vote.
Also today, the rights commission criticized Iraq, adopting a resolution that "strongly condemns the systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights," which it said resulted "in an all-pervasive repression and oppression sustained by broad-based discrimination and widespread terror."
The resolution was approved, 32 to 0, after Russia failed to muster support for diluting it by removing some of the tougher wording. Russia and China were among the 21 countries that abstained.
In Cuba's case, an independent United Nations investigator, Carl Johan Groth of Sweden, told the commission last month that President Fidel Castro's Communist Government systematically and brutally repressed its domestic critics.
But he added that the nearly four-decade-long United States economic embargo against Cuba was partly to blame for the situation, causing a "tragic shortage of material goods" and "untold hardships."
The United States effort to keep pressure on Cuba has been steadily losing allies. Beginning with the first United States resolution in 1992, support has been dwindling. This year Italy and France, which co-sponsored the American resolution in 1997, refused to do so again, although they did vote for it.
France declined co-sponsorship because of Washington's hard line on Cuba, said the French delegate, Marion Paradas-Bouveau. "Cuba has cooperated with the U.N. human rights bodies," she said. Failure to include amendments sponsored by the European Union also weakened support, further isolating the United States on Cuba, she added.
Disenchantment with United States policy has been fueled by European objections to the Helms-Burton Act, which imposes penalties on companies that use United States properties in Cuba that were seized by the Castro Government three decades ago.
Cuba's overtures toward the Roman Catholic Church, particularly the visit of Pope John Paul II in January, and the country's increasing acceptance at international and regional forums bolstered its campaign to portray itself as a victim of a vindictive United States, a diplomat said.

HEADLINE: Questions of Excellence In Consortium Ranking

BYLINE: By JO THOMAS 

DATELINE: GLENCOE, Ill.

 BODY:
The fourth-grade classroom in this affluent Chicago suburb might be more spacious than most, with room for computers and a red plaid sofa, but there was nothing costly about the way Glen Werner began her science class. She turned off the lights.
"What did I do?" she demanded of her West School class. 
 Jamie Freedman had his hand up first and said, "You opened up the circuit." And how could they tell when the switch was connected to a conductor? Andy Schaye answered, "Because the lights go on."
Mrs. Werner teaches in a public school district north of Chicago that has banded together with 19 other districts to improve math and science education.
When the Third International Math and Science Study earlier this year reported a dismal showing for the United States, Richard W. Riley, the Secretary of Education, pointed to these districts as a shining exception. Grandly named the First in the World Consortium, they had made special arrangments to take the test as if they were a country. As such, their eighth-grade students performed nearly as well in science as top-scoring Singapore. They ranked No. 5 in math, substantially higher than the United States, at No. 28.
While it may not be surprising that children who have books at home and parents who went to college perform well, the test showed that students in countries with fewer advantages still outperformed Americans. Scholars say that once affluence is taken into account, some schools still do better than others. Why the differences? It is a question educators across the country are trying to answer.
They have some clues: half of the consortium's eighth-grade students take algebra, compared with only 20 percent nationally. All eighth-grade students in Japan have taken or are taking algebra.
Educators are also questioning the value of homework and tracking. Others have taken issue with the amount of time math teachers spend going over old material; surveys taken for the international study showed that two-thirds of American teachers spent only 10 minutes introducing a new concept in math, far less than high-achieving countries.
"We don't have to look overseas for what's right," said Richard Laine, an associate superintendent for the Illinois State Board of Education. Acknowledging that the consortium schools are in wealthy districts, Mr. Laine added that they "are doing something we can learn from."
The consortium, which began three years ago, grew out of a superintendents' reading group and now includes 37,125 students. The name refers to a goal set by the President's Goals 2000 program: "That U.S. students will be first in the world in mathematics and science achievement."
But the results of the Third International Math and Science Study, which in the 1994-95 school year tested hundreds of thousands of students in 41 countries at ages 9 and 13 and in their last year of high school, showed that goal to be a dream. After the fourth grade, American students of all economic levels fell behind their counterparts in other countries.
Using teacher discussions, research projects and seminars, the consortium hopes to pinpoint what it is doing right. It also hopes to learn what needs to be changed. The consortium's study will compare its test results with data gathered by the international study, about teaching practices, textbooks, curricula, student attitudes, and how students spend their time. Findings will soon be posted on the Internet. Superintendents from consortium districts have already described their project in meetings of educators around the nation and have been invited to discuss it with school districts in Ohio and Minnesota.
"We've got a myriad of questions staring us in the face," said Jean McGrew, superintendent of Glenbrook High School District 225 and a member of the consortium.
Homework, Mr. McGrew said, is one issue the country should grapple with. "We tend to give more homework than many of the other countries, especially Germany and Japan," he said, mentioning two countries that outperformed the United States. "We have this almost-religious belief in homework. Is it producing anything? Maybe we ought to give less homework and make it more focused."
In "Facing the Consequences," a discussion of the findings scheduled for publication this summer, William H. Schmidt, the national research coordinator, and other scholars associated with the National Research Center for TIMSS at Michigan State University, warn that "American children are not getting the science and mathematics education they deserve."
The international study showed that American children spent no more time watching television than children in countries that scored better. And American teachers also taught more hours of math and science. The problem, Mr. Schmidt and other scholars believe, is in the classroom itself.
In fact, a point noted by the State of Illinois in an analysis of the international study's tests was that a school's instructional program could make a difference even when other factors were not ideal. For example, in Hong Kong, where 55 percent of the students reported that neither parent finished high school, the average score in mathematics was 584, far higher than the average scores in the United States in both math (513) and science (527) among children with a parent holding a college degree.
Experts at the University of California at Los Angeles who analyzed eighth-grade mathematics lessons videotaped for the international study rated 23 percent of the lessons in Germany and 30 percent in Japan as high quality. None of the lessons in the United States was rated highly. In fact, 87 percent were rated low quality.
The international study found that American teachers demanded less high-level thought from students and instruction was less focused.
The study also called into question the American practice of separating children into groups on the basis of academic ability, noting that the practice, called tracking, "may well have sacrificed the attainments of more average students in an attempt to bolster the performance of better students, especially in mathematics."
That effort has failed, Mr. Schmidt contended, saying, "Even the best U.S. students were not among the best from all TIMSS countries."
In both fourth and eighth grades, the best American students fell near the median for Singapore in mathematics and close to average for Austria, the Czech Republic, Korea and Japan.
"This is not something we can say, 'Aha! Let's fix it!' " said Daniel P. Johnson, superintendent of Glenview School District 34. "It comes back to: What are we doing? What are our expectations? What are our strategies?"
Mr. Johnson said he saw no justification for holding students back by tracking them in the early grades, arguing that "we shouldn't be in the sorting and selecting business."
To help improve instruction, teachers in the consortium are replaced by substitutes in the classroom to give them time to meet with other teachers to discuss instruction models, curriculum, technology and testing.
"We're always looking for things that will make us better teachers," said Deb Bailey, who teaches middle school mathematics at Central School in Glencoe and has 22 years of experience.
"We sit and share things that work and talk about things that don't work," Ms. Bailey said. "Normally, I hate leaving the classroom. I never call in sick. But the First in the World is such a big thing -- you see the kinds of things we can do."
At West School, Mrs. Werner said she was "working my own way to problem-based learning."
"I give children a messy problem, and they try to find ways to solve it," she said.
On a recent April afternoon, Mrs. Werner showed 21 students a pile of homemade circuit boards, aluminum foil sandwiched between cardboard that had been punched with holes labeled A to M.
"Promise me not to look inside," Mrs. Werner said. "Show me you know which holes are connected. Create your own tester. Take a couple of minutes and brainstorm with your partner."
A buzz filled the room. "I heard some good ideas," she said as a child from each team picked up testing equipment -- wires, flashlight batteries and tiny light bulbs. The children went to work, not always with success.
"We did everything right," one girl wailed. "It still doesn't work."
Across the room, Carolyn Goldschmidt and two other girls connected two holes and lighted a bulb. "We got one!" cried Carolyn, clapping.
Mrs. Werner stopped them. "Let's take three seconds, and give me some feedback. Sam, freeze! Your eyes, they belong to me. What did we find out?"
Jamie was the first to venture an answer, "They have to be connected under." Mrs. Werner shot back, "With what?" and he answered, "Foil -- a conductor."
Mrs. Werner told her fourth-grade students to open their circuit boards and look inside. Some of the holes were connected. Some were not. She handed out more cardboard squares. "Here's a board," she said. "Create your own. I have a roll of tinfoil. Create your own puzzle, make an answer key, then exchange it with someone else."
As the students worked, their teacher seemed everywhere at once.
"I forgot I was going to put on Mozart," she said. "It's supposed to stimulate the brain."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Leaders Link Teen-Age Smoking Measure With Anti-Drug Bill

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21

 BODY:
Hoping to seize the political initiative from President Clinton, Republican leaders in Congress suggested today that legislation to keep teen-agers from smoking should be linked with an antidrug bill.
Without specifying what such legislation would entail, Speaker Newt Gingrich said at a news conference, "I think that we should look seriously at including an anti-teen-smoking provision in an omnibus bill designed to bring down illegal drug addiction." 
 At a separate news conference, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said he agreed with the Gingrich approach.
But the White House rejected it out of hand. "If this is their way of copping out on tobacco, we're not for it," said Bruce N. Reed, the President's chief domestic policy adviser. "We want to see comprehensive tobacco legislation, not cosmetic legislation."
Other officials emphasized the observation this week by C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, that 20 times as many Americans die each year from smoking as from narcotics.
Republicans have been on the defensive all year on the tobacco issue. Mr. Clinton and Democrats in Congress have been trumpeting anti-smoking measures, and both parties have polls showing that this has worked to the Democrats' advantage. The Republicans' standing has been further damaged by their being the main beneficiaries of campaign donations from cigarette manufacturers.
Republican spokesmen have fretted that if a strong antismoking bill passes, the President will gain the credit and that if one fails, the Republican Congress will be blamed.
The party's problems have been enhanced by Mr. Gingrich's propensity to make off-the-cuff statements about smoking that can be construed to mean he is sympathetic to the cigarette companies.
At a fund-raiser in Pennsylvania on Monday night, for instance, Mr. Gingrich suggested that Joe Camel, the R. J. Reynolds cartoon character who was banished from billboards because critics thought he was too appealing to children, had been given a bum rap.
"In order to understand what's happened with teen smoking," Mr. Gingrich said, speaking extemporaneously, "this is not complicated -- it has nothing to do with Joe Camel."
A worse problem, he said, was smoking on screen by Hollywood stars like Leonardo DiCaprio, the leading actor in "Titanic."
The Speaker's remarks were reported by the Reuters news agency.
For the second consecutive day, Mr. Clinton leapt at the opening Mr. Gingrich had provided. At the outset of a statement this afternoon in the White House Rose Garden about his legislative agenda, the President declared: "Now, some in Congress say that teen smoking has nothing to do with Joe Camel. Medical science and common sense make it plain: teen smoking has everything to do with Joe Camel -- with unscrupulous marketing campaigns that prey on the insecurities and dreams of our children."
The Speaker denied at his news conference that he was making excuses for the tobacco companies. "They clearly were trying to addict 14-year-olds," he said, "and they were clearly lying to the United States Congress and the American people about their behavior."
Mr. Gingrich, who does not smoke, said that his father and his adoptive father had died of lung cancer and that he wished young people who were starting to smoke could visit a hospital and see someone who was dying from having smoked.
He also read aloud a newspaper column by Hillary Rodham Clinton in which the First Lady denounced smoking in films.
The Speaker's suggestion today that antismoking and antidrug legislation should be linked was in the context of trying to gain political advantage from the Clinton Administration's announcement on Monday about needle exchange programs. The officials announced that programs to distribute clean needles to drug addicts could save lives by reducing the spread of AIDS but that Federal money should not be used for such programs.
Mr. Gingrich interpreted this to mean, "Well, as long as your needle is clean, what's a little heroin or cocaine among friends? Your Government would like to give you a free needle but doesn't have the courage to do it."
The Republican position, Mr. Gingrich said, was, "If we're going to communicate with teen-agers, we want to communicate across the board; we don't want to drive them from one addictive substance to another."
At another news conference today, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said he was skeptical of whether a steep price increase, which the President favors, would inhibit smoking by young people.
A smoker and an economist, Mr. Armey said that his "rational intuition" told him that the demand for tobacco was "inelastic." That is the word economists use to describe products for which the demand does not fall when the price rises.
Mr. Armey said that he was unalterably opposed to a tobacco bill approved this month by the Senate Commerce Committee, but he refused to explain why.
The chief sponsor of the Commerce Committee's bill, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, met at the White House this afternoon with the top Presidential advisers on tobacco matters, and Mr. Clinton joined the discussions part of the time.
The McCain bill would raise the price of cigarettes, strengthen regulations and penalize the tobacco industry if goals for reducing smoking by young people are not met. This is essentially what the President wants. But neither he nor Senator McCain sees it in his advantage to embrace the other's position entirely.

HEADLINE: TV Notes;
Cultivating A 'Seinfeld' Heir

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
Several networks are scrambling to find comedies that are direct descendants of "Seinfeld," but one network already has a show created by a "Seinfeld" graduate, and it is taking unusual steps to try to keep it alive.
The network is WB and the show is "Alright Already," the product of Carol Leifer, a longtime writer on "Seinfeld," one of Jerry Seinfeld's friends from stand-up comedy and, according to Seinfeld legend, a model for the character of Elaine. 
 Despite what have to be called marginal ratings (a 2.1 national average, good for just over 2 million homes), Garth Ancier, the head of programming for WB, said, "There is a 95 percent probability" that the network will bring the comedy back next season.
WB believes so strongly in the show, he said, that he is actively searching for the right "smart comedy" to add to the schedule to help build "Alright Already" into a hit. And that search is going to include whatever comedies Mr. Ancier can find in the remainder bin next month.
"We may take a show off another network," Mr. Ancier said, "depending on what becomes available."
He said he has already thought about such likely cancelees as NBC's "Fired Up" and CBS's "Gregory Hines Show." He even considered a much more high-profile candidate.
"I thought seriously about going after 'Ellen,' " Mr. Ancier said, expecting, as most television executives now do, that ABC will drop the groundbreaking Ellen Degeneres series. "But economically it just didn't make sense for us."
Why all this effort for such a low-rated show? Mr. Ancier cited the show's "smart writing" (despite its less-than-smart spelling of "all right") and the fact that few comedies now emerge quickly as hits, forcing networks to identify those with real promise and "be incredibly patient with them."
In the series, Ms. Leifer plays a Miami Beach optician surrounded by a suitably quirky cast of friends and relatives. She cited her four years writing for "Seinfeld" under its co-creator Larry David as a huge influence. "Watching the way Larry structured the show was great for me," she said. "I think our show has its own flavor -- kind of mocha almond."
"Alright Already" played most of the year on Sunday nights but this week moved to Mondays. "Not a whole lot better," Ms. Leifer said. "First we faced 'The X-Files,' now it's 'Ally McBeal.' "
Starting up the show meant a return to performing for Ms. Leifer, who this week also signed to star in a stand-up comedy special for HBO sometime next year. BILL CARTER

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Wish You Were Here;
Marxist Cuba Beckons, And U.S. Capitalists Champ at the Bit

BYLINE: By JIM CARRIER 

 BODY:
Last month, two Caterpillar Inc. executives had the kind of face-to-face meeting with a national leader that salesmen dream about -- except the leader was Fidel Castro, and they weren't allowed to sell him anything.
At a dinner the Cuban leader gave in Havana for several American business people, Mr. Castro asked the Caterpillar managers about bulldozers. They told him the largest Cat exceeded 1,000 horsepower. His bushy eyebrows shot up; Cuba's Russian machines are only 100 horse and are notoriously unreliable. "I can't comprehend" bulldozers like the ones his guests were describing, Mr. Castro said through an interpreter. 
 At about the same time, a high-ranking Cuban diplomat traveled to the world headquarters of the Radisson Hotels, a unit of the Carlson Companies, in St. Paul. He assured Peter Blyth, Radisson's president, that three sites eyed by Radisson years ago in Havana and Varadero, a resort on the northern coast, were still available for hotel development. The properties have no claims against them by foreigners forced out of the country after Mr. Castro took power in 1959, he added, and the Cuban Government was eager to do business with Radisson.
These two recent contacts between capitalist America and Communist Cuba represent a small but growing movement by American companies to prepare for the day when doing business with Cuba is not trading with the enemy, as most such transactions are now legally defined. In spite of the 36-year-old United States embargo that prohibits all but a narrow range of commercial activity, and in spite of discouragement by the State Department, American executives are circling the island like Navy gunboats once did, and, in increasing numbers, actually landing.
Cuba's needs are certainly monumental. American executives who have visited Cuba recently estimate the market just for basic goods and services like food, medicine and road repair at $2 billion to $4 billion annually. Mr. Blyth of Radisson Hotels predicts Americans would flood Cuba in the unlikely event that travel restrictions were eased -- driving up the number of annual foreign visitors to 10 million from the current mostly European crop of 1.2 million. Under current law, Americans are free to travel to Cuba, but cannot spend a dime unless they are licensed by the State Department or are the guests of officially designated hosts, like the Cuban Government or some foreign company.
"You could run brake shoes over for '53 Chevys and make a fortune," said Rob O'Neill, manager of the Key West, Fla., harbor, who often talks with associates about the money-making opportunities that will open up when the embargo ends.
Before Americans can sign deals, however, Congress must lift the embargo. And that is unlikely to happen as long as Mr. Castro remains in power. "Castro has to leave, vertically or horizontally," said Marc Thiessen, press spokesman for Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Even so, he suggested, Mr. Castro's departure may not be so far off. "We're so close," Mr. Thiessen suggested. "Castro's revolution is dead."
Still, with the prospect of the bars coming down to the hemisphere's last forbidden market, an island of 11 million people just 90 miles south of the Florida coast, American business is straining at the leash. "It's not even controversial in our membership," said John Howard, director of international policy for the United States Chamber of Commerce. "There is a widespread and growing sentiment that our policy toward Cuba makes no sense."
For now, American business is pretty much limited to advocating a change in American policy, which has been dictated for decades by the mostly anti-Castro Cuban-American community, to slipping through the few fissures that Washington has allowed to develop in the ban, and to keeping up a dialogue with Cubans.
The number of American business representatives traveling to Cuba -- legally, but in most cases without State Department sanction -- has quadrupled to a projected 2,000 this year from 500 in 1994, according to the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council of New York.
Just last month, a delegation of midlevel officers from major corporations -- including the Mobil Oil Corporation, Texaco Inc., Pharmacia & Upjohn, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Continental Grain, the Case Corporation, a unit of Tenneco, and Caterpillar Inc. -- was the official guest of Mr. Castro and his top ministers in Havana, and a follow-up trade show is proposed in September, said the organizer, Kirby Jones of Alamar Associates. Another trade show for American companies, this one for medical products, is planned within the year by PWN Exhibicon International, based in Connecticut. For the most part, participants in such events describe them as fact-finding tours, though American companies are allowed to take such measures as signing nonbinding letters of intent with Cuban groups or registering trademarks and brand names.
Meantime, President Clinton has widened ever so slightly some small cracks in the trade embargo. On March 20, he announced a measure to expedite shipments of drug and medical equipment, which are already exempt from the ban. At the same time, he authorized the resumption of direct flights to Cuba and of remittances of up to $1,200 by Americans to relatives in Cuba, a measure that should increase sales for the approximately 100 American companies given special dispensation to trade with Cuba.
Those companies do a combined $100-million-a-year business in Cuba -- a drop in the bucket compared with the inroads being made by some of America's trading partners. The Cuban Government reports that companies from 25 countries have committed $2 billion to 340 joint ventures and associations with the Cubans, and have announced other deals worth an additional $4.5 billion.
Canada is the biggest foreign investor, accounting for one-third of the money flowing into the country, followed by Italy, Mexico, Spain, France and the Netherlands. The Sherritt International Corporation of Toronto is reportedly the single most active foreign company, with $800 million committed. The company produces 40 percent of Cuba's oil and is also involved in mining, power generation, cell phones, tourism and agriculture, said Patrice Merrin Best, senior vice president.
Mr. Castro, one of the world's last avowedly Marxist leaders, has made a series of concessions to the capitalist West since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of Moscow's $3-billion-a-year subsidy to his economy. He has liberalized agriculture, allowed tourists to spend dollars, and even invited the Pope for a visit in February. In 1995, his Government created free trade zones and allowed up to 100 percent foreign ownership in many sectors.
This year, the Cuban Government will be host to 250 trade fairs, a turnabout 38 years after Mr. Castro began the nationalization of hundreds of foreign companies that led to the trade embargo. The first property seized, on June 29, 1960, was a Texaco refinery. The rest followed on Aug. 6. President John F. Kennedy imposed the embargo Feb. 7, 1962.
Nearly 6,000 property claims have been certified by the United States; more than half of them, with a 1972 value of $1.8 billion, are held by 30 corporations. Under the Helms-Burton Act of 1996, the embargo can be lifted only after those claims are settled by a democratic government that does not include Fidel or Raul Castro.
Rather than cowing American companies keen on doing business in Cuba, however, that requirement has galvanized them to speak out against the embargo, according to John Kavulich 2d, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a nonprofit business organization that describes itself as nonpartisan. "Large companies moved from just gathering information about Cuba to finding out what they could do in Cuba today, and then doing it," he said.
Even some companies with big compensation claims are cautious about making an issue of them as they eye the Cuban market. Texaco hopes to resolve its demand "if the opportunity represents itself," said Chris Gidez, director of external communications. Meantime, the company sent a member of its Latin American business team to Havana last month to meet with Government officials.
Until now, most American corporations have feared approaching Cuba's shores, even when it was legal. Medical sales, for example, have been allowed for years, but only 40 transactions have been licensed since 1992, and medical companies have given away more than they've sold. Another 10 exploratory licenses have been issued.
Medical companies appear reluctant to jump into Cuba; Eli Lilly & Company said it had no plans to apply for a license as long as the full embargo remained. Part of the reason for their hesitation is the endless paperwork that awaits them. Any pharmaceutical company wishing to exhibit products at the planned trade show by PWN Exhibicon International, for example, must first get a permit from the Federal Government, then a separate license to sell any product, be it an X-ray machine or a box of surgical gloves.
Even more daunting is a prohibition on high-technology exports so broad that it basically includes anything with a microprocessor. "They think it's going to be put in the nose of a cruise missile and sent back our way," said W. Bradford Gary, a board member of the Medical Device Manufacturers Association, who visited Cuba last month. As a result, he said, Cuban doctors wash and re-use surgical gloves and operate 1950's kidney-dialysis machines with no spare parts.
At the moment, the largest licensed transaction with Cuba is AT&T's annual payment of $23 million for access to the Cuban market, part of $66 million in fees from nine long-distance companies. (Most of the long-distance calls that AT&T makes money on originate in the United States.) American airlines pay another $6 million to fly over Cuban air space en route to South America.
Other transactions range from Western Union Moneygrams to three charter flights a week from three Miami charter airlines, which last year were permitted to fly 17,000 journalists, academicians and humanitarians and 43,000 Cuban-Americans home for their once-a-year family visit.
After two American civilian planes were shot down by Cuba in 1996, direct flights to the island were banned, and American visitors had to travel first to Mexico or the Bahamas and board foreign airlines there for the final leg to Havana. President Clinton's reversal of that policy is expected to reduce the round-trip fare to about $300 from $400, while increasing the traffic handled by American charter companies by 50 percent, to 90,000 passengers a year, said Vivian Mannerud. president of the Airline Broker Company.
"Since the Pope's visit, we've seen an increase in visa applications, nearly doubling," Ms. Mannerud said. "People are saying it's time to visit their families, some who have waited 30 years."

HEADLINE: Behind Headlines on Study, a Couple Married to Their Work

BYLINE: By KATIE HAFNER 

 BODY:
LAST Friday, Donna L. HoffmanDonna L. Hoffman started the day knowing it would be far from routine. The journal Science had just published an article she co-wrote, a groundbreaking report demonstrating that lower-income black Americans are far less likely to have Internet access than whites of similar economic status. News reports about the study had already appeared.
Dr. Hoffman is no stranger to sensitive topics. She and her husband and fellow researcher Thomas P. Novak, in their studies of the Internet, have touched on subjects like pornography. So, she expected her phone to start ringing early (most calls were from reporters) at her home in Nashville and at her office at Vanderbilt University, where she is an associate professor. 
 Then she checked her E-mail in box, which was quickly filling up. While some messages were requests for more information, many others were bilious, racist attacks. They not only questioned the study's validity but also expressed anger that such a study would be conducted at all. One man, saying he was "sick of quotas, whining, cultural sensitivity, etc.," remarked, "Why not put a Nike Swoosh on the computer boxes and sell them in Sneaker King?" She was used to strange E-mail, but not to hate.
Gary Chapman, director of the 21st Century Project at the University of Texas at Austin, who has worked to bring computer access to low-income communities, said the E-mail was no surprise to him. "The Internet attracts racist speech," he said. "It's unacceptable to say these things in normal public discourse, but on the Internet it can be vented on a system that is essentially anonymous."
The import of the Hoffman-Novak study, Mr. Chapman said, was that it pointed not just at who lacked Internet access but also at what was lacking on the Internet. "The results seem to suggest that content on the Internet isn't compelling enough to the African-American community," Mr. Chapman said. "They want to see something that reflects their view of the world, which is often hard to find on the Internet."
Dr. Hoffman said few of the people sending racist comments appeared to have read the paper itself, which is available on the Web (www2000.ogsm.vanderbilt.edu/paper list.html), even though they had gone to some lengths to find her E-mail address.
"It was stunning," Dr. Hoffman said of such messages. "It points out that there clearly is a problem here, and much of the problem has to do with people's attitudes."
The recent study published by Dr. Hoffman and Dr. Novak is not the first of theirs to attract attention. At the forefront of their field -- Internet marketing, an area in which they were pioneers -- the two scholars have a knack for picking topical subjects.
For nearly 20 years, Drs. Hoffman and Novak, both 42, have intensely combined work and marriage. Not only do they specialize in the same area -- market segmentation and commercialization of the World Wide Web -- but they also conduct their research together and publish all papers jointly. "Some people might think it's overkill," Dr. Hoffman said. "But we've found it's really efficient to work together and play together."
The couple started their careers as statisticians studying behavior. They met in 1978 as graduate students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "I thought Tom was too much of an Oberlin hippie, and he thought I was really snotty," Dr. Hoffman said. The frost thawed, however, and one night after a movie date, Dr. Hoffman went to Dr. Novak's apartment and "never left." They married in 1979.
After stints at universities in New York and Texas, they ended up at the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University in 1993. Soon after their arrival at Vanderbilt, they downloaded Mosaic, an early Web browser, for the first time and were immediately captivated by the potential of the Web.
IN 1994 they started Project 2000 to study the marketing implications of commercializing the Web, and the program has become a pre-eminent research center for studying electronic commerce. Their recent study is the first to attach numbers to a situation that many people had only suspected.
"Donna Hoffman and Tom Novak have brought serious quantitative methods to many of the tough social issues facing the Internet," said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. "They have set themselves apart from the pundits, market analysts and commentators."
In 1995, Drs. Hoffman and Novak were the first to discredit the research of Marty Rimm, an undergraduate who asserted that the Internet was awash in pornography. "They put him through a Cuisinart," Gary Chapman said. They drew attention to themselves again later that year when they challenged the methodology underlying a demographic report that led to inflated estimates of the numer of Internet users.
Dr. Hoffman, who has become something of a household name in computing circles, has eclipsed Dr. Novak in the limelight. She travels extensively, lecturing and attending conferences. When reporters call, she answers. Less outgoing by nature, Dr. Novak said he preferred to stay home and do research.
Dr. Hoffman said she was completely taken aback by the invective that has poured into her computer over the past week. As of Tuesday, she had received close to 50 E-mail messages, about 30 of them negative. Many critics have taken their opinions to the Net itself. More than 170 postings -- many similar in tone to the E-mail Dr. Hoffman received -- have been made to a discussion forum on ZDNet (www.zdnet.com/zdnn/content/msnb/0417/ 307772.html).
Given the speed with which things change on the Internet, Dr. Novak said, the data in the paper, collected more than a year ago, are already out of date. New numbers being gathered appear to paint a more optimistic picture.
"We would expect that many more African-Americans will be on line when we look at the more recent numbers," he said. It will be interesting, he added, to see what kind of E-mail the researchers receive once they publish the follow-up study, which they plan to do later this year.

HEADLINE: Computers Are Starting to Listen, and Understand

BYLINE: By ANNE EISENBERG 

 BODY:
IN January, Deborah Bauder bought a new dictation program for students with various disabilities at a center she directs and found it so effective that she was soon using it herself to handle daily writing chores.
"I gradually switched from typing and clicking to speaking," she said. "Now I turn on my PC, put on the headset and talk my reports or E-mail. I'm retraining myself to save my hands from repetitive stress injury. It's also a fast, accurate way to work." 
 Dr. Bauder had tried and rejected earlier dictation products as inefficient, but she and many others have recently discovered a new generation of markedly improved speech-based products. They are popping up everywhere: to switch on the pot for morning coffee, to open word processing files, to read E-mail.
Computers can now recognize what is said to them, and even talk back, thanks to relatively recent advances in speech recognition programming combined with powerful and ever-cheaper computer processing power.
New users need time and patience to learn the ways of voice-driven technology -- out of the box, the programs make mistakes that would get most typists fired.
But, flaws and all, conversational technology is so useful that it is already changing the way many people interact with computer chips. Consumers who are ready for the switch will find a new generation of speech-based products that stand prepared to talk about E-mail or the latest mortgage rates while mimicking the solicitousness and tact of a Jeeves.
Dictation may well be the way that automatic speech recognition conquers the nation's desktops, as experiences like Dr. Bauder's are repeated. Until about 15 months ago, dictation programs required a pause between each word, reminding many users of the Bob and Ray routine "Slow Talkers of America," in which Bob maddens Ray by s-p-e-a-k-i-n-g v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y. Now, two companies, Dragon Systems and International Business Machines, have programs priced under $200 for "continuous dictation," the name for programs that will listen to and reproduce words spoken by someone talking at a steady rate in phrases or sentences.
There is a catch: the systems are "speaker dependent" -- a new user has to train the programs to recognize the quirks in a voice, like how a Southerner pronounces "house" or how a Boston resident says "yard." While the programs are not free of errors, a big leap in voice-recognition technology in the last year allows the system to learn the patterns of the speaker quickly, whether the English is standard or has the lilt of another language or dialect. The process takes about 20 to 30 minutes for those who sound like broadcast news anchors and a bit longer for everyone else. The new owner must also introduce the speech recognizer to on-the-job jargon.
After an hour or so of training, the programs will type at a fair clip: 75 to 80 words per minute are common, with accuracy steadily increasing as the program masters the cadences of the speaker and adds frequently used words to its base vocabulary.
The other hot application for speech technology lies in voice-automated phone transactions, which are sorely needed, as anyone who has negotiated touch-tone choices for anything like a train schedule knows. (Press 1 if you are human. Press 2 if you are no longer sure.)
People dislike such phone menus, said Joe Yaworski of the Unisys Corporation in Paoli, Pa., which sells Natural Language Speech Assistant, a toolkit that companies use to link automatic speech recognition, called interactive voice response systems, to their call banks. "The common phone menu these days averages 69 choices -- although 27 are optimal," Mr. Yaworski said. "People have to drill their way down four or five levels to get information. We've found it's typical that up to 70 percent of callers bail out and hit 0 for the operator."
Automated speech recognition systems permit callers to ask a complex question like, "Do you have flights to Nashville from La Guardia today?" rather than punching in answers to questions about the date of flight, origin of flight and destination.
The speech recognition systems are possible because they work within narrow contexts like airline reservations or mortgage rates, restricting the size of vocabulary and extracting the core meaning from a person's natural answer to a specific question. The programs use many tactics, including word-spotting algorithms that can handle variations like "on Sunday," "this Sunday" and "ummm, Sunday."
"Because of the range of what people can say -- the natural language problem -- initially all of these products will work by limiting vocabulary and possible answers," said Jackie Fenn, an industry analyst at the Gartner Group, based in Stamford, Conn. "They'll focus on highly constrained situations. This means you can't talk to your microwave about the weather, but you can discuss dinner."
Applied Language Technologies, called Altech, a Boston company that focuses on automating over-the-phone transactions like those in banking, travel and investing, tries to make its programs more accurate by getting them to approximate human responses. "Even humans don't achieve 100 percent accuracy when they talk on the telephone," said Bill O'Farrell, co-founder and chairman of the company. "We all need a fair amount of clarification, like, 'I'm sorry' or 'Could you run that past me again?' A good speech user interface mimics these qualities." If Altech's speech recognizer misses a beat, it politely says: "I didn't catch that. Did you say yes or no?"
Altech's Speech Works technology is used by the E-Trade Group of Palo Alto, Calif., which has about 1,000 telephone lines for its electronic brokerage business. On a given day, 15 percent to 20 percent of the brokerage's business comes in by interactive voice responses. "Of that percentage, 20 to 30 percent is handled via speech recognition software," said Michael Welton, who manages the company's voice-response products. "The system has a 50,000 word vocabulary -- quite a recognition challenge." At every step, the program confirms what the customer says (e.g., "I think you said buy 300 shares at the market. Is that correct?").
The people who telephone E-Trade and decide to buy stock through a speech recognizer instead of a person deal with what is called a speaker-independent program. No training time is possible when thousands of people are calling and each one speaks differently. Speaker-independent systems improve their accuracy, in part, by limiting the vocabulary in the possible answers callers can give.
Input, what the speaker says to the machine, is only one side of the speech recognition coin. On the other is output, called text-to-speech in the trade. For now, machines remain better listeners than text-to-speakers: they can talk intelligibly, but few would mistake the sound for a human voice.
"The technology here has lagged," said Paul Saffo of the Institute for the Future, a research organization in Menlo Park, Calif. "I'm still waiting for a voice that will pass the Turing test -- although, come to think of it, I have some friends who would not pass this test." (The Turing test is named for Alan Turing, who said true artificial intelligence would be shown when a machine's conversation could be mistaken for a person's.)
In either case, said David Nahamoo, director of speech technology at I.B.M.'s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., "conversational technology is going to become the mode of any device you can imagine embedded in the office, at home or in the car." He added, "Speech is the interface of the future."
With either the I.B.M. or Dragon Systems programs, accuracy improves substantially if users accustom the program to their voices and vocabularies. People with bad colds can count on five minutes of retraining but can always save those voices for the next time they have the flu and insist on working.
These systems can be used not only for dictating E-mail and memos -- in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Chinese so far -- but also for editing them. Voice commands open files and permit revisions. Sentences like "move the last sentence to the end of the paragraph" can now be understood by some programs.
Both I.B.M.'s Via Voice Gold and the Dragon System's Naturally Speaking Preferred let people use voice -- or a combination of voice, mouse and keyboard -- for editing and formatting. Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products expects to introduce a moderately priced continuous dictation program, called Voice Xpress Plus, in early May, a company spokeswoman said. There are also dictation products for Macs, but they require pauses between words.
While the new systems are good, it is probably not time to throw away the mouse and keyboard yet. Erik Chesla, a computer consultant who specializes in speech technology, said any shift to voice-driven computing took time. "Training a dictation program to recognize a speaker's voice and vocabulary is the first step; learning the voice commands is the second step," he said. "You can't just say 'file' when you want to open a file, for instance; you have to say 'click file.' There are dozens of these tricks people have to learn."
Mr. Chesla said voice-activated products also required a change of habits. "Ten years ago, people had trouble freeing their right hand from typing to use the mouse to navigate," he said. "Now -- wearing a brace -- they want to leave the mouse behind, but they have to learn a new routine. Give it a month or so. It won't happen overnight, but it's worth learning."
Mr. Saffo agrees that conversational technology is imminent but he is not entirely cheerful about it. "Faster chips plus better algorithms have given us this acceleration effect where voice recognition is popping up everywhere," he said. "My fear is what happens with every new toy: you try to use it for everything. If we're not careful, we'll end up with a world in which all our devices are jabbering away at us. I for one don't want to have a conversation with my espresso machine in the morning."

Charts: "Matching Spoken Sounds With Words"
More powerful computers have enabled speech recognition programs to become more accurate. Current programs, which do not require any special hardware, rely on a mathematical process of matching the spoken sounds with words in a database.
 
The Sound Is Digitized . . .
The user speaks into a microphone attached to the computer. The computer breaks the sound into tiny pieces that it can convert from a sound wave into digital audio, like that stored on a CD.
 
Then the Pronunciation Is Analyzed . . .
Strings of digitized sounds are compared with a dictionary of phonetic word spellings. Strings of words are a more accurate way of figuring out what was said because people tend to blend the endings of some words with the beginning of the word that follows.
 
And the Right Word Is Chosen.
Finally the computer makes sure that the word makes sense in context. The computer can make an educated guess about what the user's next word will be by analyzing what was just said. It searches a database of millions of words from representative texts to derive a list of probable word choices. Then it chooses the word that best matches the pronunciation and context.

Naturally Speaking Preferred
"A solid program. I could speak clearly and at a normal pace. Accuracy was higher -- about 90 percent. More difficult to install, and it eats hard drive space like there is no tomorrow. A better application than Via Voice. One problem: there are integration applications to make Nat Speak work with Microsoft Word, and you need to download them from the company's Web site."
 
Via Voice Gold
"Training the application took a long time, which is to be expected, but I was getting drowsy after what seemed like the 500th phrase. I estimate the accuracy rate to be about 85 percent in use. Easy to install and use; overall, it's an O.K. product. There were too many instances of 'I talk, and it didn't type.' Also, my speech needed to be choppy, instead of continuous, to make sure the program picked up every word."

Naturally Speaking Preferred
"I found the training, customizing, and editing features of Naturally Speaking to be more intuitive than Via Voice Gold, and if that trifecta weren't enough, the Dragon product was a bit more accurate in my testing too. Ordinarily, that would seal the deal for me, but I found dictating into its spartan word processor and then cutting and pasting into Word to be an unnecessary, almost galling, detour -- it's as if the City of New York were trying to tell me which way I could cross at an intersection. You can download updates from Dragon's Web site, but this should be in the program."
 
Via Voice Gold
"While this version makes its vocabulary larger and editing easier, I still found Via Voice Gold a bit less accurate and a little more frustrating to correct than Naturally Speaking. But right out of the box, Via Voice Gold can put a Dictate command on Microsoft Word's menu bar and lets me dictate right into Word, among other applications. I like 110-volt appliances for the same reason -- I know the 220-volt vacuum cleaner could probably suck bugs from the air, but I don't want to go through the conversion hassle." (pg. G8)

HEADLINE: Museum Exchanges Looted Art for a Show

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
Almost as soon as the Wadsworth Atheneum here purchased Jacopo Zucchi's "Bath of Bathsheba" in 1965, there was trouble. The painting turned out to be stolen, ripped from the walls of the Italian Embassy in Berlin in the waning days of World War II. The Italians, naturally, wanted the 16th-century work back, never mind that the Atheneum had bought it in good faith from a Paris dealer.
All these years later, "Bathsheba" will soon be Rome-bound, but not until the Atheneum plays host to "Caravaggio and His Italian Followers," an exhibition opening tomorrow that is drawn mostly from Italy's national collections and that was sent by Rome in exchange. 
 The swap is not quite even. The Atheneum is out the $35,000 it paid for the painting, which today might fetch $500,000. But the museum saves the estimated $350,000 cost of the exhibition, said Peter C. Sutton, its director, who did the deal despite some grumbling from Hartford residents about returning the spoils of war.
Besides, the show, which runs through July 26, is important not only because it is a happy ending to the dispute. It may have repercussions for other museums and art historians as well as the Atheneum, which in recent years has retreated from a trail-blazing past replete with adventurous acquisitions and exhibitions.
With the search for war booty intensifying, as a result of the opening of many wartime archives, the publication of several books on the issue and the creation of organizations to pursue lost art, other museums may use the Atheneum's deal as a model. "This is the first case we brought to a good end, and I hope it sets a precedent," said Mario Bondioli Osio, the president of the Interministerial Commission for Artworks, which Italy created in 1995 to recover its lost patrimony.
Mr. Osio is seeking looted art at other museums in the United States, France and Germany that he declined to name. And Mr. Sutton said he had received "several calls" from other museum directors. "They say: 'Can I speak to you privately? I have this little problem,' " he said.
In a small way, "Caravaggio" breaks new art historical ground, too. With just 40 paintings, including 5 by the master, it is far less ambitious than the Metropolitan Museum of Art's "Age of Caravaggio" in 1985, which boasted about 100 pictures, including roughly 40 by or attributed to Caravaggio.
But scholars are keen to see the Atheneum's juxtaposition of two Caravaggios called "St. John the Baptist in the Wilderness," one from Italy and one borrowed from the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, which have not been together since they were painted in 1604-05, if then. "We will be able to see, given the subject of St. John, what does Caravaggio do with it -- what are the differences, when one was for an altarpiece, a focus of worship, and one was for a private collector?" said Keith Christiansen, the Metropolitan's expert in Italian paintings.
There is a new attribution to ponder, too. As the Italians prepared to send the 29 paintings they are lending, they found that "The Fortuneteller" was executed by Simon Vouet, a 17th-century Frenchman, not by Bartolomeo Manfredi, the Italian who became the most important exponent of the Caravaggio style of genre painting. Mr. Christiansen called the discovery astonishing. "It poses questions of Vouet's relation to Caravaggio and Caravaggisti in a new light," he said.
If "Caravaggio," which also includes works from the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, a private collection and the Atheneum's permanent holdings, creates as much excitement as Mr. Sutton hopes, it may do the most good of all for the Atheneum, whose annual attendance has been stuck at about 160,000.
"Caravaggio" is the first test of Mr. Sutton's plan to transform the Atheneum. By offering more clever special exhibitions, conceived locally instead of borrowed from other museums, he believes the Atheneum will draw local crowds, earn respect from its bigger brethren and see its example imitated by other museums that have stagnated.
It once was so. Founded in 1842, the Atheneum is America's oldest continuously operating museum. Besides being known for a distinguished permanent collection (bounteous in Hudson River school landscapes, Baroque art, and decorative arts), the museum claims an illustrious history, full of innovation.
It was the first American museum to buy a Caravaggio (1943) and the first to buy a Dali (1931). It presented the first comprehensive retrospective of Picasso in this country (1934), and the first exhibitions here of Surrealism (1931), Italian Baroque paintings (1930) and Neo-Romanticism (1931). It gave many contemporary artists their first solo show in an American museum, including Gerhard Richter, Keith Haring, Sherrie Levine, Cady Noland, Richard Tuttle, Neil Jenney and on and on.
J. P. Morgan, a Hartford native, gave it a building, as did Elizabeth Hart Jarvis Colt, of the firearms family. For a while in the 1970's, annual attendance reached 260,000.
But that was years ago.
The museum's fortunes sank as Hartford's did. "Metropolitan Hartford is one of the nation's weakest economies in the 1990's," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Regional Financial Associates, a consulting firm. Jobs, which peaked at 662,000 in October, 1988, bottomed out at 584,000 in January, 1996, and each year, 5,000 to 10,000 people moved away, Mr. Zandi said.
Mr. Sutton, 49, arrived at the Atheneum in November 1996 after stints as an expert on Old Masters (particularly Northern European) at Christie's and as a curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It was good timing. The city's economy was starting to expand again, and with it hopes by officials for a Hartford renaissance.
Under Mr. Sutton's orders, the museum's curators are organizing at least three exhibitions a year. A few did not like the new standard and have left. But in September there will be a big show comparing, for the first time, the development of Australian and American landscape paintings, organized with the National Gallery of Australia. Then comes the first solo show of Pieter de Hooch, a painter from the Dutch Golden Age, organized with the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London.
In 1999 a show of Alfred Stieglitz, Georgia O'Keeffe and their circle is on the docket. And for 2000, there will be Dali in the 1930's, Picasso's paintings of his studio, and "The Impressionists at Argenteuil," organized with the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
Mr. Sutton's extensive contacts in the art world have surely helped. It was he who called Paul Hayes Tucker, a Monet expert at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, to organize the Argentueil show and who enlisted the National Gallery as co-organizer.
"These things allow us to play in a bigger league," said Elizabeth Kornhauser, the chief curator. "I am trying to make it more exciting," Mr. Sutton said. "A lot of people don't walk in the door because museums are perceived as highbrow institutions that have nothing to do with modern life."
That is why he worked hard to convince the Italians to lend their treasures from the Palazzo Barberini and Palazzo Corsino in Rome.
Initially, Mr. Osio offered not "Caravaggio" but an exhibition of Neopolitan paintings. "They wanted to lend from the basement," Mr. Sutton said. "So I went back and asked for their greatest hits -- Caravaggio, Raphael . . . "
Both sides seem happy with "Caravaggio." "These are paintings of the highest quality that are normally on view here," Mr. Osio said from Rome. Mr. Sutton is sure the public will respond. "Look at the image on our Caravaggio poster," he said, referring to a depiction of St. Cecilia with a lute, by Saraceni. "Anyone could love it. This is not a decapitated saint or anything."

How the American Left Lost Hope

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

ACHIEVING OUR COUNTRY
Leftist Thought in 20th-Century America
By Richard Rorty
159 pages. Harvard University Press. $18.95.
 In his philosophically rigorous new book, "Achieving Our Country: Leftist Thought in 20th-Century America," Richard Rorty raises a provocative if familiar question: Whatever happened to national pride in this country? Not what he terms "simple-minded militaristic chauvinism," but the sort of pride that "is to countries what self-respect is to individuals: a necessary condition for self-improvement."
What in particular has happened to the pride instilled by Walt Whitman and John Dewey that, Mr. Rorty says, "was ubiquitous on the American left prior to the Vietnam War"? This was a pride that envisioned the American experiment as secular, anti-authoritarian and infinite in possibilities that Whitman idealized as loving relationships and Dewey as good citizenship. It was a pragmatic pride, demanding action rather than mere spectatorship, which is why it was essential to what motivated the "Old Left," or what Mr. Rorty prefers to call the "reformist left." 
 What happened to this activist pride? Mr. Rorty, the neo-pragmatist philosopher who teaches at the University of Virginia, offers an answer in "Achieving Our Country," which is based on the William E. Massey Sr. Lectures in the History of American Civilization he delivered last year at Harvard University. He argues that in the 1960's the reformist left was eclipsed by the New Left, which rejected it for supporting the cold war and, by extension, Vietnam.
But because of the Marxist strain in its thinking, Mr. Rorty writes, the New Left was too pure to take up the reformist left's causes, which demanded a willingness to compromise principles "in order to form alliances with groups about whom you have grave doubts."
While crediting the New Left for being instrumental in ending American involvement in Vietnam, Mr. Rorty blames it for retreating from pragmatism into theory. This has led members of the left "to give cultural politics preference over real politics, and to mock the very idea that democratic institutions might once again be made to serve social justice," he writes. "It leads them to prefer knowledge to hope."
Meanwhile, he argues, "leftists in the academy have permitted cultural politics to supplant real politics, and have collaborated with the right in making cultural issues central to public debate." While he credits what he calls "the new cultural left" for ameliorating the harm done by sadistic treatment of women, racial minorities and homosexuals, he also blames it for working to preserve "otherness" instead of ignoring it, for stressing the one issue to the exclusion of others, for cutting itself off from the remnant of the reformist left and for clinging to a view of America quite the opposite of national pride.
So what does Mr. Rorty offer as a solution besides exhorting the left to change its ways, get involved and shed what he calls its "semiconscious anti-Americanism, which it carried over from the rage of the late Sixties"? Not really very much. "Achieving Our Country" is more a critique of the left than a prescription for its rehabilitation in his terms, and given the sharpness of the critique, the book is unlikely to win over those who are the subject of his disapproval.
Trying to reform the left, Mr. Rorty even resorts to a form of intellectual bullying. He warns that if the cultural left continues to ignore what he calls the declining economic condition of American workers, they will become vulnerable to the demagogy of some fascist strongman, who will play on their fears and prejudices with the result that "all the sadism which the academic left has tried to make unacceptable to its students will come flooding back." Yet earlier he argues that such sadism has turned out not to be the result of "economic inequality and insecurity," and that the belief of the American left in such economic determinism was "too simplistic."
At the same time, so uncritical is his celebration of the left as, "by definition, the party of hope" and the right as inevitably selfish and committed to the status quo, that independent thinkers are unlikely to be persuaded by his reasoning. He writes: "The right thinks that our country already has a moral identity, and hopes to keep that identity intact. It fears economic and political change, and therefore easily becomes the pawn of the rich and powerful -- the people whose selfish interests are served by forestalling such change." Yet it never seems to occur to him that the left, in seeking change for its own sake, by peaceful means as well as violent, might as easily become the pawn of the nihilistic and destructive.
Still, if Mr. Rorty doesn't quite lead the way to a revival of national pride on the left, he offers a persuasive analysis of why such pride has been lost. As a philosopher, he is particularly thought-provoking in his readings of Whitman and Dewey as prophets of the American religion. Speaking of acts like the massacring of American Indians who stood in the settlers' way and our conduct in Vietnam, he asks, "is there then nothing incompatible with American national pride?"
He responds: "I think the Dewey-Whitman answer is that there are many things that should chasten and temper such pride, but that nothing a nation has done should make it impossible for a constitutional democracy to regain self-respect. To say that certain acts do make this impossible is to abandon the secular, authoritarian vocabulary of shared social hope in favor of a vocabulary which Whitman and Dewey abhorred: a vocabulary built around the notion of sin."
For Mr. Rorty, like Whitman and Dewey, the sin is suicidal guilt and despair. Anything short of such sin permits hope in the darkest hour and the beginnings of self-forgiveness, which leads on to a renewal of pride.

HEADLINE: In America;
Giuliani's Wild Pitches

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
"Purely from a financial analysis point of view," said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani back in April 1996, "the place where the city could build a new stadium at virtually no cost to the taxpayer or very little cost to the taxpayer would be in Manhattan."
State officials chuckled in private at that one. Said one: "Somebody has got to tell him to stop saying that because, you know, it's not true." 
 On Monday the Mayor crawled a little closer to the truth. With lots of charts but little in the way of specifics, he announced a plan that would dedicate hundreds of millions of tax dollars to begin -- just to begin, mind you -- financing new stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets.
This money would come from the commercial-rent tax, which is paid by large businesses south of 96th Street in Manhattan and which the Mayor had said was a terrible tax and ought to be phased out. Now we should keep it, but not to fix our crumbling, overcrowded schools, or to offset the effects of looming budget deficits. No, we should hang onto this tax so the revenues can be handed over like a Valentine each year to George Steinbrenner, principal owner of the Yankees, and Fred Wilpon, co-owner of the Mets.
The Mayor's admission that trainloads of tax dollars would be needed to finance the stadiums was not, however, an indication that he is ready to be significantly more candid with the public about these matters.
"The proposal they put out this week was amazingly vague," said Thomas McMahon, the City Council's finance director. "People don't know what we'd be paying for, what we'd be buying. Is it one stadium, two stadiums, three, four? Nobody knows."
The Mayor, his imagination running rampant, suggested on Monday that his tax proposal could be used to help build stadiums for football and soccer as well as baseball. How this would happen he didn't say.
Mr. Giuliani's primary goal is to secure a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan for Mr. Steinbrenner. He has seemed willing to say anything and pay any price to achieve that. In 1996, when the Mayor was making his preposterous claim that a West Side stadium could be built with little or no cost to the taxpayer, he was also saying that the "revenue stream" from such a stadium would be "off the charts."
Now, even as he's admitting that the use of public money is essential, and that tax dollars will have to go to the Yankees and the Mets, the Mayor continues to insist that this giveaway would realize a fabulous return.
"This spending," he said, "will result in, bare minimum, at least $1 billion more for our economy and thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs."
If the new stadiums are such gold mines, then why aren't private interests rushing to finance their construction? The answer is that private interests can make a lot of money from the stadiums as long as they don't have to pay to build them. The real gold mine is the city treasury, and Mr. Giuliani has graciously invited Mr. Steinbrenner and Mr. Wilpon to come in and stake their claims.
In an era when Republicans especially are screaming about the wonders of the free market, it is comical to watch G.O.P. politicians across the country line up in support of the giveaway of public resources to prospering private businesses. Free indeed.
A major reason that baseball owners like George Steinbrenner are so anxious to get their hands on new ball parks is the additional revenue that comes from the sale or lease of luxurious skyboxes, or stadium suites. The boxes, used for "entertaining" by corporations, have proved enormously popular and can enhance the value of a franchise by many millions of dollars.
The public subsidizes the construction of the stadium, but it's the team owners who get richer from the luxury suites. This is a matter of public policy that deserves some further discussion.
In any event, the general public and nearly all the elected officials in Manhattan and the Bronx are opposed to the construction of a stadium for the Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan. The sentiment citywide for keeping the Yankees in the Bronx is overwhelming.
But Mr. Steinbrenner wants a stadium on the West Side and Mr. Giuliani is running interference for him.
Whose town is it anyway?

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Japan's financial woes are real, but not insurmountable.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
PITY the bewildered politicians floundering for a way out of the mess in Tokyo. The Japan that could once do no wrong has morphed into the Japan that can do no right, with every effort to turn around the lagging economy dismissed as too little, too late. "This is a market that sees only bad news," said Richard Medley, managing partner of Medley Global Associates in New York.
Cooler heads do not minimize Japan's economic woes. But they still think a cure for the cyclic downturn, which is making the economy's long-term problems far more difficult to tackle, is within reach. Indeed, some predict that the tax cuts proposed by the administration of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, to be detailed tomorrow, will contain the seeds of Japan's economic redemption. 
 The muscular Japanese economy these days is more likely to be compared to a beached whale than an 800-pound gorilla. Consider Japan's notoriously clubby capital markets. There is no particular reason to think they have grown less efficient over the years. But inefficiency is now a greater liability.
'When Japan was playing catch-up, virtually any investment had a big payoff," said Gary Saxonhouse, an economist at the University of Michigan. "But in a developed economy, top-down allocation doesn't work." Indeed, the return on corporate equity in Japan averages a miserable 4 percent -- one-quarter the rate in America.
By the same token, Japan faces a chilling demographic reality -- a 20 percent decline in the working-age population combined with a huge jump in retirees over the next two decades -- a certainty that makes America's looming problems with Social Security and Medicare financing seem modest. While saving rates are extraordinarily high, they are not nearly high enough to support the elderly as long as the return on capital remains in single digits.
To cope with these problems, Japan has been moving rapidly, at least by Japanese standards, to raise the productivity of capital while building a nest egg for future retirees. "Hashimoto thought he had struck a grand bargain with the Ministry of Finance," Mr. Saxonhouse said. "Deregulation to make capital markets more competitive, combined with taxes on consumption to increase national savings."
But the timing could hardly have been worse. The prescribed increase in the national sales tax, pounded through the Diet against popular opposition, took effect last April, just as the economy was entering a downturn. Output fell sharply, the already ailing stock market plummeted and, in the aftermath of the financial market crash in parts of Asia, Japan's badly undercapitalized banks virtually closed their lending windows. Expansionary monetary policy, which has pushed interest rates close to zero, has done little to ease the crisis.
Yet while pessimism is all the rage, most economists still have faith that Japan can dig its way out using traditional tools. "Fiscal stimulus is especially effective when interest rates are on the floor and there is a need to jump-start confidence," noted Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary.
And while Prime Minister Hashimoto has burned a lot of credibility by exaggerating the value of past fiscal initiatives and by funneling much of the money into projects that benefit well-connected construction companies, there is some reason to believe the Government now gets the point.
"Ideally," argued Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, "Japan would enact temporary cuts in the consumption tax." Unlike a temporary income tax cut, he points out, households would have no incentives to sock away the proceeds. And unlike a permanent income tax cut that raised household spending, a temporary consumption tax cut would not undermine long-term efforts to increase national savings.
A temporary rollback in the national sales tax is widely seen as a nonstarter: The Hashimoto administration spent too much political capital raising that tax a year ago to flip-flop. But Mr. Medley predicted that a good portion of the "targeted" income tax cuts to be introduced by Tokyo would amount to temporary consumption tax cuts by another name. A prime candidate is income tax credits for purchases of new cars and houses.
A growth rate of 2 percent to 3 percent would be no panacea. But it would make financial reform that drove thousands of unprofitable concerns into bankruptcy less traumatic. And it would give Japanese households a positive return on their savings.
The biggest stumbling block, Mr. Medley suggested, is the skepticism that greets every effort to rebuild economic confidence. "The way the Hashimoto Government has been treated, it would be hard not to be paranoid," he said.

HEADLINE: Hail to the Turkmen Dictator

 BODY:
For a textbook illustration of the intoxicating power of oil and gas, consider the visit of the President of the Central Asian Republic of Turkmenistan. Saparmurat Niyazov concludes his three-day visit to Washington today with a luncheon with President Clinton and a visit with Vice President Gore. Mr. Niyazov's trip has been full of such triumphal pomp. He gets these diplomatic goodies because he has two things Washington wants. One is political neutrality -- Turkmenistan offers a bulwark against the influence of its neighbor Iran. More important, Turkmenistan has the world's fourth-largest natural gas reserves, and Washington wants American companies to pump the gas through friendly nations to the West.
Yesterday President Niyazov signed an agreement with Energy Secretary Federico Pena to work together to develop Turkmenistan's oil and gas industry. Mr. Niyazov agreed to let the United States finance a feasibility study on the construction of a pipeline for oil and gas under the Caspian Sea. He also signed deals with Mobil and Exxon, and has been feted by American energy companies. A sycophantic Mobil advertisement published recently in The Washington Post bore the headline "Turkmenistan: Setting a Course for Prosperity." 
 Turkmenistan bought an eight-page advertising section in this week's Time magazine, touting itself as "Central Asia's stable state." Stable it is, as Mr. Niyazov continues to rule in the same way he did when he was head of Turkmenistan's Communist Party. There has been virtually no economic reform, and last year the country's economy contracted by more than 25 percent.
While other dictators deflect criticism by permitting a token opposition, Mr. Niyazov has no patience for such niceties. There is no dissent of any kind, and political opponents are sent to psychiatric hospitals. In 1994 Mr. Niyazov held a rigged referendum on whether to suspend the next presidential elections and simply extend his term until 2002. It passed with 99.9 percent of the vote.
American officials have consistently raised human rights concerns with their Turkmen counterparts, and Administration officials say that Mr. Niyazov has promised to be more democratic. Yet an unreformed Mr. Niyazov still enjoys a cozy relationship with Washington. Any talk about loosening his hold on his country has been lost in the din of the welcoming trumpets.

BYLINE: By Lani Guinier; Lani Guinier is the author of "Lift Every Voice: Turning a Civil Rights Setback Into a New Vision of Social Justice."

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
Now that the results are in, some opponents of affirmative action are having second thoughts. One year after California passed a referendum banning the use of race and ethnicity in public college admissions, the number of blacks, Hispanics and American Indians admitted to the University of California's two top campuses has dropped precipitously, leading to concern about the resegregation of higher education.
But while the news from California is dismaying, a different, more encouraging story is being written in Texas, a state with political leaders who see diversity as a rich resource that benefits everyone, not only people of color. 
 Last year, a Federal court outlawed consideration of race in higher-education admissions in Texas. At the time, the state had been using high school grades and Scholastic Assessment Test scores along with affirmative action criteria to decide admissions.
After the ruling, a panel of professors and community activists joined a group of Hispanic and black lawmakers to persuade the State Legislature to adopt what has come to be called the 10 percent plan.
This eliminated the use of S.A.T. scores for Texas students in the top 10 percent of their high school class and automatically admitted them to the two most selective public schools, the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A & M University.
At first, some critics objected that S.A.T. scores were indispensable measures of future success. But, as the advisory group of professors and activists pointed out, the best way to predict how a student will do in college is by measuring classroom performance in high school. This was borne out when achievement tests administered to the thousands of minority students admitted through the program showed that only a handful needed remedial education.
So far the Texas plan has produced many winners. As of March of this year, 7 percent more black and 21 percent more Mexican-American applicants were eligible for enrollment under this system than under the old affirmative action guidelines. And access to public education has increased for white high school graduates in rural parts of Texas -- students who also tend not to do well on the S.A.T. and so had been refused admission to the most competitive public colleges under the old system.
No wonder a number of moderate white legislators joined the coalition in supporting the plan. As State Representative Irma Rangel pointed out, the 10 percent plan treats all groups equally, giving them "the respect they deserve." Similarly, when Gov. George Bush, a Republican, signed the bill, he declared, "We want all our students in Texas to have a fair shot at achieving their dreams, and this legislation gives them that fair shot."
Texas officials recognize that there is more to be done beyond rethinking college admissions policy. They have also formulated new ideas for improving primary schools. Schools and districts are now required to report test scores, attendance and dropout rates by race, ethnicity and economic standing. Each school is then rated according to the performance of the various ethnic and economic groups. This means more attention is paid to every student, and the entire class benefits.
As a result, black, Hispanic and economically disadvantaged students are closing the achievement gap. On a national math test given in 1996, Texas fourth graders in various categories -- white, black and poor students -- all ranked first in the country. By contrast, California, where politicians have demonized issues of race, education and immigration, saw its fourth graders, including white students, finish near the bottom, ahead of those in only two other states.
Texas's innovative approaches, and its less polarized environment, are helping to shift an increasingly narrow debate over affirmative action into a wider public discussion on education. This also sends the message that access and diversity are not the enemy of excellence.

HEADLINE: Americans, Flouting U.N. Embargo, Organize Relief for Iraqis

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 22

 BODY:
Little by little, in small efforts linked by new networks, Americans are beginning to react against a policy of continued sanctions against Iraq by organizing their own relief projects for the Iraqi people.
Today, Americares, a private relief organization based in New Canaan, Conn., announced the largest mission to date. Over three days next week, with the help of the Royal Jordanian Air Force, the organization says it will carry out the first American airlift of more than 75,000 pounds of medicines and hospital supplies to Baghdad, where nearly eight years of sanctions have crippled the civilian medical system. 
 Guy L. Smith 4th, a vice chairman of Americares, said at a news conference this morning that it was purely coincidental that the American goods would begin arriving in Iraq on Monday, just as the Security Council prepares to renew the sanctions for another six months. "Americares goes where there is a need, irrespective of race, creed or political persuasion," he said.
Other organizations are giving a more political slant to their activities, withholding any criticism of Iraqi policy while condemning the United States and the United Nations for continuing to impose a tough embargo on Iraq. The sanctions have been in place since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
Voices in the Wilderness, a Chicago-based organization that has been sending groups to Iraq with some medical and other supplies permitted under Security Council regulations, organized days of protests earlier this year outside the Baghdad headquarters of the United Nations team charged with destroying Iraq's major weapons systems. The sanctions cannot be lifted until the commission declares Iraq free of prohibited arms.
In New York, a coalition called the Iraq Sanctions Challenge is being formed by Ramsey Clark, United States Attorney General in the Johnson Administration. The coalition intends to defy American policy wherever it can on this issue. It also plans to send volunteers and medical supplies to Iraq and to stage a week of protests in the United States from May 6 to 13.
"In the spirit of the civil rights movement, we refuse to abide by unjust U.S. laws or U.N. resolutions that result in death and destruction for Iraqi children, women and men," says a flyer being circulated to potential coalition members around the United States. It alleges that more than 1.5 million people have been killed by the sanctions.
The Iraq Sanctions Challenge has attracted the support of groups like Pastors for Peace, the Middle East Children's Alliance and the Bruderhof, a communal movement in New York, Pennsylvania and England, which has produced a graphic videotape of dying children in Iraq, asserting that they were killed by sanctions, which they label as "genocide." The video juxtaposes shots of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, speaking in another context, calling the sanctions policy "worth the price."
Absent from virtually all of the calls for action circulating in the United States is any blame for President Hussein, who chose for more than five years not to buy medicine or food through the controlled sale of oil, which he was permitted to do by the Security Council. No mention is made of his marble-lined palaces, stables full of luxury cars, or of the human-rights record of the Iraqi Government, which a United Nations monitor recently reported had executed at least 1,500 people over the last year for political reasons.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place -- Tightening the Faucet;
How U.S. Filter Is Consolidating the Waterworks

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: PALM DESERT, Calif.

 BODY:
Richard J. Heckmann knows the value of water. And it is not just because he lives here in the desert.
In a few short years, Mr. Heckmann has created the nation's largest water-related company, the United States Filter Corporation. Through more than 130 acquisitions, U.S. Filter has soared from $20 million in revenues in 1990 to a projected $5 billion in the coming year, making it more than 10 times the size of its nearest competitor. 
 In doing so, Mr. Heckmann, a former stockbroker who is so glib he could sell water to a fish, has set off a consolidation trend in the sleepy and highly localized water business and brought it to Wall Street's attention.
"How could it be that there is no Intel, I.B.M., General Motors or Toys 'R' Us in the water business?" he asked. "You can live without all those things. Five days without water you're dead."
Since early 1997, U.S. Filter has made more than 75 acquisitions, culminating in February with its agreement to pay $1.5 billion in stock for Culligan Water Technologies, a leader in residential water treatment devices and bottled water. That deal will bring Mr. Heckmann close to his goal of creating a one-stop shop, with everything from bottled water to filters, valves and pipes.
U.S. Filter is also building and running complete water and waste-water treatment plants to take advantage of one of the big trends of the business -- outsourcing. Companies like Dow Chemical and the chip maker LSI Logic, which once ran their own water treatment systems, are entrusting that job at some of their factories to U.S. Filter and paying by the gallon for water of a specified purity. And municipalities like Atlanta, Milwaukee and Buffalo are turning over water treatment to private companies to preserve capital and cut costs.
Many have been won over by Mr. Heckmann's vision. But others view him as the Pied Piper of the water business rather than its Moses, as someone much better at hawking his own company's stock than at selling reverse osmosis equipment.
But the skeptics also say that U.S. Filter has assembled a grab-bag of companies, some not very good ones and some for which it overpaid. It has yet to prove, they say, that it can run them as a cohesive business and earn back the cost of capital it took to buy them. "They're huge, and it's happened in a very short period," said Norm Miranda, president of Americas' Water Service in Naperville, Ill., who left a previous company after U.S. Filter acquired it. "It's kind of wait and see to see how all the pieces come together."
Once the acquisitions slow or stop, U.S. Filter will have to depend on internal growth, and the fundamentals of its business -- now obscured by the acquisitions -- will come into clearer view. And that, detractors predict, is when the house of cards could come crashing down.
Mr. Heckmann and some of his executives have leather-bound copies of a book about Waste Management Inc., a role model for U.S. Filter. But Waste Management ran into problems when it ran out of acquisitions in the solid waste business. Another risk of rapid acquisitions was experienced last week by the Cendant Corporation, which saw its stock lose nearly half its value after accounting irregularities appeared in a company it had acquired.
The day of reckoning, if it is to come, is probably not far away, since U.S. Filter is getting so big it will be harder to grow by acquisitions. And investors are becoming wary of the former Wall Street darling. U.S. Filter's stock rose from pennies a share in 1990 to more than $30 in 1996, despite the dilution from all the mergers, allowing the company to pay for its acquisitions in stock rather than cash. But the stock price has been stagnant for the last year and a half. It closed at $34.4375 on Wednesday, up 68.75 cents, putting the stock at about 22 times earnings, about the same as the broad market.
Supporters say Mr. Heckmann has defied skeptics so far and should continue to do so. "When I first heard him speak in 1992, he said by 1996 he'd have a billion in revenues," said Rod Lache, an analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. "When you hear a $40 million company say something like that, you take a skeptical eye." But Mr. Heckmann achieved his plan. "He's a visionary," Mr. Lache said.
Mr. Heckmann, 54, studied politics at the University of Hawaii and founded the Tower Scientific Corporation, a manufacturer of prosthetic devices, which he sold in 1977, giving him financial security.
Although he is a Republican -- former Vice President Dan Quayle and the former Reagan economic adviser Arthur B. Laffer sit on U.S. Filter's board -- Mr. Heckmann served two years as an official in the Small Business Administration under President Jimmy Carter.
After leaving Washington, he was elected mayor of Sun Valley, Idaho, but quit because of conflict of interest accusations about his ownership of the city's taxi service and a hotel.
In 1982 he moved to the Palm Springs area and became a stockbroker. In 1988, he saw a business plan for American Toxxic Control, a company that wanted to consolidate the water treatment business. Mr. Heckmann bought stock at $2.50 a share that promptly fell to about a penny. Still intrigued with the concept, Mr. Heckmann put together an investment group that bought the company for $1.6 million and renamed it U.S. Filter.
What attracted him to the business? The world's supply of water is fixed, Mr. Heckmann explains, yet demand keeps growing as population and economic activity increase. That means higher prices for water and more spending on treatment.
The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that American communities will have to spend about $140 billion the next 20 years to upgrade the systems that supply drinking water. And, Mr. Heckmann said, 56 percent of Americans now drink contaminated water, according to the E.P.A. The fast growth of bottled water shows consumers will pay dearly for clean water. "Evian costs $350 a barrel," Mr. Heckmann said. "Oil is only $16 a barrel."
Industries like microelectronics and pharmaceuticals need ever-purer water to make increasingly sophisticated products. And there is a potentially big market in developing areas that need water and sewage systems. Globally, he said, water is a $300 billion business growing to $500 billion by the turn of the century.
But Mr. Heckmann is prone to exaggeration. He contends he was a founder of Callaway Golf, famous for Big Bertha clubs, but was actually an early investor after the company had been running for two years. The E.P.A. says it believes only 19 percent of Americans, not 56 percent, drink water from systems that have violated a standard.
And there are obstacles to Mr. Heckmann's ambitions. The water business "never turned out to be the really dynamic story that people have touted intermittently over the years," said Walter Morris, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee, who has followed the business for 25 years.
Despite its size, U.S. Filter does face some well-heeled competition. According to Public Works Financing, a newsletter, U.S. Filter is No. 3 in the outsourcing of municipal water and waste-water treatment behind Professional Services Group Inc. of Houston and United Water Resources Inc. of Harrington Park, N.J., both of which are backed by huge French conglomerates.
The tangled politics of water can also interfere with business. Last year, U.S. Filter paid the Bass brothers $250 million in stock to buy land, mainly 45,000 acres of farmland in the Imperial Valley in the southeast corner of California. The deal made the Texas billionaires major shareholders of U.S. Filter, with a stake now of 8 percent. The land comes with valuable water rights. "This is the Saudi Arabia of water," Mr. Heckmann said. So Mr. Heckmann plans to save irrigation water, by conservation and recycling, and sell it to San Diego. Other water districts object to the plan, and the issue has become a political minefield.
The biggest question about U.S. Filter, though, is whether it can run the business as well as it built it. Its headquarters has fewer than 50 people, remarkably small for a $5 billion company. Mr. Heckmann leaves detailed operations to a cadre of lieutenants, most of whom have been with him for years and have become rich from their stock. They seem to idolize their boss but also fear him because he can lose his temper with people who disagree with him.
For water business expertise, U.S. Filter relies on managers of the acquired companies and induces them to stay by giving them U.S. Filter stock, too. The company prides itself on this decentralized approach, but it may also interfere with achieving synergies. To unify the disparate cultures, U.S. Filter has hired Lou Holtz, former football coach at Notre Dame, to travel to its more than 600 sites and give pep talks.
Mr. Heckmann insists the company, excluding acquisitions, is growing 10 percent a year. As an example of synergy, U.S. Filter cites its 1996 acquisition of WTS, a company with about $5 million in sales. By pushing WTS's products through U.S. Filter's big distribution network, WTS sales tripled by the end of its first year.
And Mr. Heckmann said U.S. Filter was still so small compared with the overall water industry that it could keep making acquisitions. But it is becoming harder to find companies big enough to make much of a difference. The largest publicly traded American water treatment equipment manufacturer, for example, is Ionics Inc. of Watertown, Mass., with sales of about $350 million and growth of about 17 percent a year.
Other public companies with revenues over $150 million are Osmonics, CUNO and Calgon Carbon. The Pall Corporation and Millipore are bigger than Ionics but are involved in filtration for other industries.
Potential targets might also become less willing to accept stock. Memtec, a membrane manufacturer in Australia, resisted U.S. Filter's stock offer last year, forcing the company to pay $400 million in cash in a hostile takeover. U.S. Filter took a big write-off of $440 million related to that and other acquisitions, producing a loss of $374 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31.
Mr. Heckmann knows the risk of not growing. "These roll-up strategies," he said, "run into trouble when they run out of things to roll up."

HEADLINE: Red Army Faction Disbands, Saying Its Cause Is 'Now History'

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, April 22

 BODY:
Heroes unto themselves, but reviled and once feared by the bulk of Germans, the last remaining urban guerrillas of the Red Army Faction announced this week that they had dissolved their organization because they and their cause were "now history."
A statement sent anonymously to Reuters on Monday confirmed what investigators had long believed -- that the organization, which drew strength from cold-war ideology and an international terror network stretching to the Middle East, was effectively defunct. 
 But the statement, which German authorities have since said was authentic, raised many troubling issues ranging from a slew of unsolved killings to the question of whether tough anti-terror legislation drawn up in the 1970's and 1980's should now be struck from the law books.
At the height of its notoriety in the 1970's, the Red Army Faction was seen as Europe's most deadly urban terror group, built on clandestine cells and fighting what it termed an armed struggle. It attacked not just Germany's rich and powerful, but also United States military installations that left-wing ideology termed emblems of American imperialism.
The group grew from Europe's dissent in the 1960's against the Vietnam War. But, specifically in Germany, its often middle-class members were seen as emblems of a new generation's revolt against a West German state that they characterized as Nazism's linear successor.
In the eight-page typewritten statement delivered to Reuters, which ended with the guerrillas' emblem of a five-pointed star, a stylized machine-pistol and the letters RAF, the authors said: "Today we are ending this project. The urban guerrilla group in the form of the RAF is now history."
"We are stuck in a dead end," the statement said, acknowledging that the group had made strategic errors, but expressing no contrition or regret toward the more than 30 people who died as its victims. Officials at the Federal Criminal Office in Wiesbaden said the document had been certified as genuine.
The last terror act ascribed to the Red Army Faction was in 1991 when Detlef Rohwedder, the head of the Treuhand privatization agency, was killed -- a crime that remains unsolved. In 1992, the organization formally abandoned acts against "leading representatives of the economy and state."
Such quiescence contrasted strongly with the way in which the group held the land in thrall in the 1970's, when terrorism flourished not just in Germany but also in Italy and in many parts of the Middle East.
In Germany, "wanted" posters adorned public buildings, and anyone who might be a target took to bullet-proof cars and bodyguards. Not only that, liberal principles in postwar German law were upended in legislation that stripped terrorism suspects of access to defense lawyers and enforced their separation in prison. Those laws are still on the books and government officials have rejected opposition demands for their repeal, maintaining they are still needed to fight organized crime.
Five fatal attacks ascribed to the Red Army Faction dating from 1985 remain unsolved. And while some members of the group now live ostensibly normal lives, have died or are among the nine terrorists still serving prison terms, its actual membership is believed by investigators to be no more than 10 people.
"With this statement, the Red Army Faction has put up its own tombstone," said Horst Herold, a former leading investigator.

HEADLINE: Similar Styles May Thwart a Deal

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Thomas A. Renyi and Frank V. Cahouet, the executives who respectively run the Bank of New York Company and the Mellon Bank Corporation, are both considered tough, focused and cost-conscious individuals who have strong ideas about how to manage their organizations.
The strength of their convictions may be what thwarts the completion of a merger the two institutions have discussed for years. 
 "They are both hard-headed guys," said Lawrence W. Cohn, director of research at Ryan, Beck & Company, a securities firm. "They are so similar that they are either going to love each other or hate each other."
Since Mr. Cahouet and Mellon's board of directors rejected Bank of New York's $90-a-share merger proposal yesterday and said the bank intended to remain independent, it seems the Pittsburgh-based banking institution has no desire to find out.
In truth, however, if Mellon's large base of institutional shareholders pressures the board to consider the offer, Mr. Cahouet and Mr. Renyi would coexist at the top of the merged Mellon Bank of New York Corporation for only a short time.
Under terms of the Bank of New York's proposal, Mr. Cahouet, 66, would serve as chairman of the merged bank, which would have more than $100 billion in assets, making it one of the 10 biggest banks in the country. Mr. Renyi, 52, would be chief executive.
But Mr. Cahouet, who came to Mellon in 1987, is scheduled to retire at the end of the year.
By contrast, Mr. Renyi took over as chairman at Bank of New York in early February, when J. Carter Bacot, the bank's strong-willed chairman and chief executive, retired after serving for 16 years.
Succession issues are no stranger to Mellon and Mr. Cahouet. Earlier discussions with Bank of New York, and with Corestates Financial, which Mellon tried to buy last year, foundered on what role Mr. Cahouet would play in the merged company.
Those failures did not sit well with shareholders, who in the past have criticized Mr. Cahouet for doing more to protect his own position than enhancing shareholder value.
Analysts said that in spite of his agreement to leave, Mr. Cahouet may also be blocking this offer.
"My belief is the sticking point on this is that Frank Cahouet wants to be chairman for as long as he wants," said one analyst, who spoke on condition that he not be identified.
During his tenure at Mellon, Mr. Cahouet has not only pulled the company back from the severe financial crisis it had been facing when he arrived, but also transformed it.
In 1992, after spending almost five years wading through bad energy and real estate loans, Mellon began to shift away from traditional banking and toward asset management with the purchase of the Boston Company.
That deal was followed in 1994 by the purchase of the Dreyfus Corporation.
Before coming to Mellon, Mr. Cahouet spent nine months in Washington as president and chief operating officer of the Federal National Mortgage Association. From 1984 to 1986, he was president and chief executive of Crocker National Bank. And prior to joining Crocker, Mr. Cahouet was vice chairman and chief financial officer at Security Pacific National Bank, which he joined in 1960.
Mr. Renyi, by comparison, has spent his entire banking life at the Bank of New York, which he joined as a trainee in 1971.
Over the last two decades Bank of New York, unlike Mellon, has been relatively trouble-free and regarded by Wall Street analysts as one of the country's best-managed financial institutions.
"They have a day-to-day focus on expense management and business management," said David S. Berry, director of research at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, the bank research firm.
Bank of New York temporarily misplaced that focus in the late 1980's, during its protracted but successful hostile takeover battle for the Irving Trust Company.
In 1989 Mr. Bacot had put Mr. Renyi in charge of the transition team responsible for merging the two companies because of his broad knowledge of the bank and its operations.
"He knows the nuts and bolts," said Diane Glossman, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. "And he is at least as careful with his pennies as Carter was."
The deal was a strategic coup for Mr. Bacot and Bank of New York. But analysts said the experience left scars, and may be a big reason Mr. Renyi said he would withdraw his offer if a friendly merger with Mellon was not possible.
"In the past I have spoken with Carter, but not Tom, about the impact of doing unfriendly transactions," said Mr. Cohn from Ryan, Beck. "The Irving deal distracted the entire organization for the better part of two years, and management feels they lost a lot of opportunities because they were so focused on getting the deal done."
Mr. Renyi may be counting on Mellon shareholders.
"The Mellon shareholder list is dominated by institutions," Mr. Cohn said. "There will be a lot of pressure brought to bear" on Mellon's board.

HEADLINE: A Gush of Profits From Water Sale?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
While Warren E. Buffett, America's second-richest man, is taking a well-publicized flier in silver, the Bass brothers of Texas are betting on a humbler commodity: water.
This latest investment by the Basses -- billionaires many times over by virtue of their investments in oil, real estate and the Walt Disney Company -- has been very good to them indeed. 
 Last year, Edward P. and Lee M. Bass traded a three-year-old, $60 million investment in rights to irrigation water largely in the Imperial Valley in California for $250 million worth of stock in the United States Filter Corporation, the world's largest seller of water treatment equipment. Teamed with U.S. Filter, they are leading an effort to sell water now set aside for farming to the parched San Diego area.
The very idea of marketing nature's bounty to the highest bidders raises hackles in the American West, where subsidized water has made the desert bloom with crops, cities rise from bare ground and the economy barrel ahead. And the tentative agreement has reignited a political firestorm.
But advocates say water sales are inevitable.
"Private property owners already provide timber, oil and food," said Ardon Moore, who manages the Bass interests in the Imperial Valley, the Western Farms and Cattle Company. "We didn't invent free markets in water, but we certainly support them."
The deal, which would move enough water to support two million suburbanites, is being cheered on by an unusual coalition of businesses and environmentalists, who view water efficiency as a key to eco-friendly growth in California.
"This is the win-win model we've been waiting for," said Tom Graff, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund. "Voluntary, large-scale water transfers that make everyone better off."
Some of the water that has permitted the rapid urbanization of semi-arid Southern California since the 1940's comes from elsewhere in the state. In fact, Los Angeles's capture of the water from the Owens River hundreds of miles away was the theme of the movie "Chinatown." But the region's real lifeline is the Colorado River.
Under a 76-year-old pact, California is entitled to a minimum of 4.4 million acre-feet of Colorado River water annually (the amount that would cover 4.4 million acres, a foot deep). And since no one else is using the surplus flow, the state routinely takes 5.3 million acre-feet -- enough to supply triple the current needs of Southern Californians.
Of the guaranteed 4.4 million acre-feet, however, just 550,000 are set aside to fill bathtubs and swimming pools in the great suburban sprawl. The rest goes to irrigate farmland in the southeast corner of the state. In the Imperial Valley, by far the largest of the three irrigation districts in the area, farmers grow two and three crops a year in the rich desert soil to yield $1 billion worth of fruit, vegetables, and livestock.
But new supplies of water in Southern California are increasingly problematic. And the state cannot count on the amount of water it now takes from the Colorado River: Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has put it on notice that as demand for water grows in neighboring states, California will be cut back to its guaranteed 4.4 million acre-feet. San Diego, in particular, is imperiled because Los Angeles has first claim to most of the water from Northern California.
That's why California farmers have been under pressure to conserve water. It's also why the Imperial Irrigation District agreed in 1988 to give 100,000 acre-feet annually to Southern California's Metropolitan Water District in return for $130 million to patch up canals that were leaking at least that much water into the desert. The "Met," which supplies water to some 16 million people, also paid the Palo Verde Irrigation District to let 20,000 acres of farmland sit fallow in 1993 and 1994 and divert the conserved water to the Met's reservoirs. But further initiatives to transfer Colorado River water from farm to city have stalled.
One reason is that the Met has taken a hard line on financial incentives. "Why should farmers profit from reducing the amount of water they waste?" asked John R. Wodraska, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District.
Another reason is that the administrators of the Imperial Irrigation District, who are elected, fear a loss of local jobs and income if less water is available for agriculture. "The valley is already coping with 25 percent unemployment," noted Mayer Malone, editor of The Imperial Valley Press. "What's going to happen if land is fallowed in order to sell the water?"
A study this year by the David Dornbusch consulting firm and commissioned by the irrigation district found that farmers would probably adjust by growing less-thirsty crops and using other conservation techniques that would increase employment. But in the face of local opposition, few landowners were prepared to stick their necks out in support of water sales until the Bass brothers bought 45,000 acres of farmland in the valley.
The theoretical case for selling some of the irrigation water is impressive. Farmers in the Imperial Valley pay $13.50 an acre-foot for water and, on average, use six acre-feet for every acre of land they cultivate. By contrast, customers of the Met pay at least $350 an acre-foot. If farmers could sell their water at that price, they could net about $2,000 an acre -- a spectacular, risk-free return on land that sells for less than $4,000 an acre.
More modest proposals still show a lucrative business. If the farmers in the Imperial Valley and the other two irrigation districts dependent on the Colorado River sold just 10 percent of the 3.85 million acre-feet of water at the $350 price, they would net about $130 million a year.
With such figures no doubt in mind, the Bass brothers pressed the irrigation district to negotiate a deal with San Diego, under which the district would transfer 200,000 acre-feet annually for a starting price of $250 an acre-foot. They then hedged their bets by exchanging their 45,000 acres -- nearly one-tenth of the valley land under cultivation -- for an 8 percent stake in U.S. Filter and a seat on the company's board.
U.S. Filter paid a premium for the land, but it incurred no debt in the transaction and stands to earn a big bonus on ancillary businesses.
Rod Lache, a securities analyst for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, suggests that executives at U.S. Filter have grand goals. "They expect to bundle the whole package for municipalities -- the water treatment equipment, the maintenance and even the water itself," he said. The ability to offer "one-stop shopping" he added, should give the company a big edge in finding customers in other water-scarce countries, where the recycling of waste-water from agriculture seems the only viable option for meeting urban demand.
A major issue, though, highlights the difficulty of creating a market for water. The old agreements setting aside 3.85 million acre-feet to the Imperial, Palo Verde and Coachella Valley irrigation districts did not specify how the water was to be divided among the three. Coachella argues that it, not San Diego, has the right to any water conserved by Imperial.
California must decide who owns what before the U.S. Filter -- or any other -- water sale goes through, and Mr. Graff of the Environmental Defense Fund wonders whether politicians are up to the challenge. "The biggest problem in creating water markets has been the lack of state and Federal leadership," he said.
Richard J. Heckmann, chairman and chief executive of U.S. Filter, is confident that stagnant supplies and rising demand for water will shift the politics decisively in favor of urban consumers. "The day Sacramento is forced to tell people they can't water their lawns," he predicted, "is the day it will all be over."

HEADLINE: U.S. Revoking Licenses to Export Firearms to Britain

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: VIENNA, April 22

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration notified the British Government today that it was revoking all pending licenses for the export of American firearms to British companies, American officials said.
The revocation is the first step, the officials said, in a plan to halt the sale of firearms by American companies to all 15 members of the European Union. Licenses to export firearms will not be issued for European Union countries until the Governments have adopted laws to guarantee that the weapons are not re-exported "to the bad guys," as one senior official in Washington put it. 
 In recent years, American firearms sold to European companies have ended up in the hands of terrorists and organized criminal gangs and in war zones like the former Yugoslavia, Turkey and Central Africa, according to American and European law-enforcement officials.
The Administration's actions in Europe are part of a broader, and growing, concern about the easy movement across borders of light weapons, which include handguns, automatic rifles, grenade launchers and hand-held missile launchers.
Here in Vienna this week, delegates to the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice are expected to call for a binding international instrument to curb weapons trafficking.
The Clinton Administration is fully backing the effort, American officials at the meeting said. And next month, the major industrial powers, the so-called Group of 7, plus Russia, are expected to adopt regulations on exporting and importing firearms, American officials said today.
American officials said the controls, pushed by Washington, have been agreed to by working-level officials from those countries, leaving only the heads of state to endorse them officially at their meeting in Birmingham, England. Although the regulations would restrict just eight countries, they include the five largest arms-producing nations, which account for 90 percent of weapons exports.
Action by those industrialized countries is therefore seen as a major breakthrough in a campaign to curb the trade in so-called small arms and light weapons.
"It would be a political commitment from influential states that indicates a significant groundswell of support in favor of a multilateral light-weapons-control regime," said Geraldine O'Callaghan, an arms-trade expert at the British American Security Information Council, a nongovernmental agency in London.
While the Clinton Administration's principal concern is to keep handguns out of the hands of criminals and drug dealers, organizations like Ms. O'Callaghan's and the United Nations are concerned about all light weapons, which they want to keep out of war zones.
Most victims of small arms are not the soldiers who carry them, but women and children.
For the Clinton Administration, and many countries, the model for international regulation is a treaty signed in November by the United States and other members of the Organization of American States.
Among other items, the treaty requires that before a country issues an export license, the importing country has to approve formally the movement. The treaty also requires that the importing country mark the weapons.
"This establishes an international system for tracing that does not exist today," said Jonathan Winer, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Narcotics and Law Enforcement. "It means that when weapons get diverted, and inevitably some do, they can be traced back to the last seller."
It is the lack of such measures, and the consequent lack of control over weapons after they have left the United States, that has led Washington to revoke export licenses.
When asked about the Clinton Administration's action, Andrew Molchan, president of the National Association of Federally Licensed Firearms Dealers, said, "It is the traditional attack on the Second Amendment gone international."
In a telephone interview from the headquarters of the association in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Mr. Molchan said that "as far as worldwide crime and international terrorism, the impact is going to be none at all," because many guns are available in other countries.
In Britain, a nongovernmental relief organization, Oxfam, applauded the United States move and said British controls over small-arms exports were too lax. In a report to be released on Thursday, "Small Arms, Wrong Hands," the organization said that British companies had sold small arms in more than 100 countries. Twenty-seven countries were in Africa, mostly suffering from political violence or open warfare, Oxfam said.
American officials say they believe that many of the weapons first came from the United States. In 1996, the State Department issued licenses to export to European Union countries nearly 140,000 handguns and slightly more than 100,000 rifles, according to the latest report by the Office of Defense Trade Controls.
Washington has acted first against Britain, not necessarily because it was guilty of the most serious abuses, American officials said, but because the problem there was presented in the starkest terms.
On March 1, one of the strictest handgun-control laws in the world went into effect in Britain. As a result, American officials realized that weapons sold to British companies were almost certainly not going to remain there.
Germany is most likely the next target of Administration action, a senior State Department official said. The State Department issued licenses for the export of 68,000 rifles to Germany in 1966, putting it far above any other European Union country, according to the State Department report. Licenses were also issued for 32,000 pistols and 89 million cartridges.
Most of the weapons bought by German companies do not enter Germany, except for the ports, where they are loaded onto another ship for another destination, American officials said. Germany has also been a transit point for weapons smuggled into the former Yugoslavia and Turkey.
The Clinton Administration is also looking closely at France, where there are 22,000 valid unfilled licenses, and Italy, where there are 18,000.

HEADLINE: With Orders Slowing, Chip Maker Will Cut Jobs

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 22

 BODY:
Facing a slowdown in chip orders, the National Semiconductor Corporation said today that it would cut 1,400 jobs worldwide, or about 10 percent of its employees, through a combination of layoffs and attrition.
National said the cuts would center primarily on the company's headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., and would include 560 employees affected by the previously announced closings of some older manufacturing operations. National said recent softness in the worldwide semiconductor market, with a corresponding decrease in orders for new chips, made it necessary to cut costs beyond what could be achieved through closing the older plants. 
 The cuts will result in a one-time charge of $60 million to $70 million before taxes, equivalent to 27 to 32 cents a share in after-tax earnings, in the fourth fiscal quarter, ending May 31. On March 12, National reported a decline in third-quarter revenue and earnings, and said it anticipated a loss in the fourth quarter.
National shares closed at $24.1875, up 62.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The announcement comes about a week after the world's largest chip maker, the Intel Corporation, said it would cut about 3,000 jobs, amid a buildup in inventories in the distribution channel for personal computers.
National has struggled in recent quarters, in part because the Asian economic crisis has sharply curtailed sales of some key products, and partly because of manufacturing problems at the Cyrix Corporation, which National acquired last year for about $550 million. Cyrix's partner in a manufacturing venture, the International Business Machines Corporation, has not been able to meet demand for higher-speed versions of microprocessors. But National said last month that it had begun its own production of these products at a plant in Portland, Me.
Last quarter's shortfall was the first sign that National may have trouble executing the strategy articulated by Brian L. Halla, the company's chairman and chief executive, of moving from high-volume, low-priced commodity chips to more specialized products that generate higher profit margins. Since Mr. Halla joined the company in May 1996, National has steadily improved its earnings and profit margins. As part of his strategy of creating new markets, National recently announced that it would develop a single-chip PC by mid-1999.
Jonathan Joseph, an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, said that while pursuing this strategy, National had lost market share and sales in its core businesses of making chips for computer networking devices and analog chips for cellular telephones. "One has to wonder if they have disaffected their cash cow," he said.

HEADLINE: Bank of New York Bids $23.7 Billion for Mellon

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
The Bank of New York Company, moving to stay near the top of the heap in the rapidly consolidating banking industry, announced an unsolicited $23.7 billion takeover offer yesterday for the Mellon Bank Corporation of Pittsburgh.
But Mellon spurned the offer, setting up the possibility that Bank of New York may mount a hostile takeover for Mellon -- a highly unusual step in the banking industry and a signal that the huge mergers that are transforming the nation's financial landscape threaten to get nasty. 
 Hostile takeovers, which require a bidder to convince a target company's board and big shareholders that an acquisition makes financial and strategic sense, are difficult to complete in any industry. They are even harder to do in banking because regulators are loath to approve deals that may disrupt the vital economic role banks play in communities where they operate.
A hostile bid by Bank of New York would be further complicated by the fact that Mellon is based in Pennsylvania, which has some of the country's toughest anti-takeover laws, and is headed by Frank V. Cahouet, a chief executive whose unwillingness to let go of the company's reins has scuttled previous merger talks.
Even so, the possibility that Bank of New York and Mellon may begin trading corporate America's version of jabs, punches or body blows to achieve their separate visions for the future is yet another vivid illustration of how determined some banks are to survive consolidation.
Over the last two and a half weeks, agreements to pursue the three largest mergers in United States banking history have occurred. A merger agreement between Bank of New York and Mellon would be the fourth largest. The breathtaking speed and size of these transactions are a testament to the importance of scale in an industry choked by more nimble nonbank competitors and left reeling by seismic shifts in how corporations and consumers manage their finances.
Bank of New York, the 18th-largest bank in the country, is betting that a combination with Mellon, the 23d largest, would assure its pre-eminence. The combined bank would rank 8th if all pending mergers were completed.
Analysts said a combination of Bank of New York and Mellon made great sense. It would give the new bank strong positions in asset management, securities processing and mutual funds and would expand the banks' respective branch networks.
Thomas A. Renyi, Bank of New York's chief executive, said he had no intention of pursuing a takeover of Mellon on anything other than a "consensual basis." Nonetheless, Mr. Renyi said he was undeterred by Mellon's clear rejection of a takeover.
"I don't necessarily accept Frank's reaction as the final word," Mr. Renyi said. "We have every intention of trying to make everyone aware of how compelling this story is."
Mr. Renyi said that he had called Mr. Cahouet on Monday to outline the takeover offer but that Mr. Cahouet had declined to meet with him. The two banks, both known for their stubbornness and determination to chart their own courses, have had merger discussions over the last several years. Merger talks between the banks ended last December after disagreements over the roles to be played by Mellon executives in a merged company.
"As a result of our discussions with Bank of New York last year, we are firmly convinced that any combination of the two organizations would be contrary to the best interests of our shareholders, employees, customers and -- in particular -- the communities we serve," Mr. Cahouet said in a news release responding to the takeover bid.
By making the takeover offer public, Bank of New York is letting analysts, investors and the media know why it thinks its bid makes business sense. Moreover, it is publicizing how much money it is willing to pay.
The bank said it would issue 1.4 shares of its stock, worth about $90, for each Mellon share, a 28 percent premium to Mellon's closing price on Tuesday of $69.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Mellon's shares shot up $8.125 yesterday, to $78, while Bank of New York's shares fell $1.6875, to $62.0625, also on the Big Board. The fact that Mellon's share price failed to rise to $90 may reflect skepticism in the stock market over whether Bank of New York's bid will be successful.
Mr. Renyi has stopped short of a full-blown hostile bid for Mellon by not placing his bank's offer before Mellon's shareholders and forcing the board to vote on the merger. If he should choose to take that step, the obstacles are formidable.
Only two previous hostile takeovers have been successful in banking, and one of them involved Bank of New York: its 1988 acquisition of the Irving Trust Company. In the other, Wells Fargo & Company of San Francisco acquired the First Interstate Corporation in 1996.
In both cases, the buyers benefited from the weak positions of the targets. Neither Irving nor First Interstate had "poison pill" provisions, which allow a target's shareholders to buy additional stock at a deep discount in the event of a hostile takeover, thus making the cost of a takeover prohibitively expensive. Neither of those banks had staggered terms for their boards, which make a takeover more difficult because it takes longer for an acquirer to gain control of the board. Finally, both of those banks were in the same state as the acquirer, meaning that state regulators were less likely to feel that an outsider was poaching on home turf.
Mellon, in contrast, has a poison pill provision and a staggered board and is in a different state from Bank of New York. Pennsylvania law makes it difficult for outsiders to take over in-state concerns by requiring that the boards of companies based there can weigh factors other than shareholder interests when considering a merger.
"Pennsylvania has the toughest takeover laws in the country," said Lee Meyerson, a lawyer at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett who specializes in banking mergers and acquisitions. "The 'just-say-no' defense is incorporated into their statutes."
Bank of New York was recently thwarted by state regulators elsewhere. Last week, it withdrew an effort to increase its holdings in the State Street Corporation, based in Boston, after regulators in Massachusetts forbade it to do so.
Nonetheless, Bank of New York is attempting to stir up shareholder interest in a merger with Mellon by disclosing its offer publicly.
"This is an attempt to draw a wedge between Cahouet, who just won't leave, and directors who are a little tired of him," said one banking lawyer who is not involved in the transaction. "Mellon shareholders will make it known whether they like this deal. If they have an open insurrection, Mellon will start looking for a white knight."
Bank advisers say it is unlikely that Mellon will find a white knight riding to its rescue from among the nation's largest banks. Mellon could, however, seek to merge with smaller banks like the Fleet Financial Corporation or the BankBoston Corporation. And, of course, Mellon could sit out the merger wave and try to remain independent -- a perilous strategy in today's banking world.
If Bank of New York were to take over Mellon, the new bank would be called the Mellon Bank of New York Company, but Bank of New York would have a majority of seats on the board. Mr. Renyi proposed a dual headquarters in Pittsburgh and New York, with Mr. Cahouet as chairman until the end of the year, when he plans to retire, and Mr. Renyi as chief executive. Mr. Renyi would assume the chairman's title upon Mr. Cahouet's retirement.
Despite the hurdles facing the Bank of New York, some investors lauded the proposal. Brian Rogers, a fund manager with T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., which owned 6.7 million Mellon shares as of the end of last year, has already expressed his approval to both banks.
"Our basic position is the Mellon side can't dismiss this out of hand," Mr. Rogers said. "Our message is the Mellon directors have some responsibility to consider this."
But Ray Garea, a fund manager who works with the investor Michael Price, a catalyst in other big bank mergers, expressed skepticism that Bank of New York would truly engage Mellon in any kind of battle, hostile or otherwise.
"I don't think this is going to happen," Mr. Garea said. "Mellon isn't interested, and I don't think Bank of New York is really going after them."

HEADLINE: '96 Stadium Study Found Fewer Benefits

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
An unpublished 1996 study found that a West Side stadium for the New York Yankees would generate $102.5 million a year for the city's economy, far less than the $1 billion projected by city officials in a new report.
The March 1996 report by KPMG Peat Marwick, a major accounting firm with a large sports consulting unit, said that a proposed 45,000-seat stadium built over a rail yard near 11th Avenue and 33d Street would generate $102.5 million in spending at the stadium and in neighborhood hotels, bars and restaurants. The report, which was obtained by The New York Times from a planner formerly connected with the city, said that a refurbished stadium at the Yankees' historic home in the Bronx would have an economic impact of $96.4 million a year. 
 But an April 17 report by city planners projected far greater economic benefits from building the proposed stadium on the West Side. The report -- which comes as the Giuliani administration faces increasing pressure from a threat by the Yankees' principal owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, to abandon the Bronx -- put the economic impact of a Manhattan stadium at more than $1 billion a year, 10 times the impact of renovating the Bronx stadium. The cost of building the stadium could run as high as $1 billion, according to the city's own study.
That report, cited in an article yesterday in The Times, came under heavy criticism from economists, urban planners and municipal bond analysts and even some real estate developers who said that the analysis went far beyond even the rosy forecasts usually made by team owners and politicians.
"It's utter gibberish," said Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College in Massachusetts and co-author of "Sports, Jobs and Taxes."
"There has not been an independent study by an economist for any stadium built over the last 30 years that suggests you can anticipate a positive economic impact," he said. "One has to take these claims with a grain of salt. The overwhelming majority of any new revenue generated by a stadium would go to Steinbrenner and the Yankees players."
Team owners and the players benefit from the revenue generated by the luxury boxes, premium seats and other amenities that accompany a new stadium. For the most part, Professor Zimbalist said, new stadiums and sports arenas change how consumers spend money on entertainment, rather than generate new revenue. Most people have a limited budget, he said, and the money they spend on baseball tickets is money they don't spend on theater tickets or movie tickets, or at a bowling alley.
Moreover, he said, stadiums and nearby restaurants and bars generally offer seasonal, low-wage jobs that have little impact on the local economy.
The 249-page report by Peat Marwick was a companion piece to a report by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, the stadium architects that examined the feasibility of building or renovating a stadium at three sites in the Bronx and one in Manhattan. The entire $600,000 study was paid for by the Yankees, the city and the state. While the city released the Hellmuth assessment study, it never distributed the Peat Marwick report.
Joseph B. Rose, the chairman of the city's Planning Commission, said that the city's draft report in April was based on the report by Peat Marwick. The new analysis, however, also takes into account the effect of building a stadium that would attract local residents and tourists to the area, and of building new transportation links to an area that is several long blocks away from Pennsylvania Station or the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
A West Side stadium, the latest report says, would foster the development of new restaurants, retail stores, movie theaters, two 600-room hotels and three 200,000-square-foot office buildings in an area now occupied by factories, warehouses and vacant lots. Mr. Rose said he estimated that the West Side had about 18.9 million square feet of space open to development.
"We're assuming a modest 2.25 million square feet of development," Mr. Rose said, "that would result from the stadium being an anchor for new development and the transportation and infrastructure improvements designed to make the stadium work."
Those developments, said Charles Millard, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, would parallel what has happened in Times Square, which has been flooded over the past two years with plans for theaters, hotels, theme restaurants and office buildings. "This is less than half of what is happening or slated to happen on 42d Street," Mr. Millard said.
Others were skeptical of any projected benefits. "Generally, stadiums don't spark hotels or office development," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Regional Financial Associates, a consulting firm whose clients include banks and real estate developers. "Hotels tend to cluster around convention centers or airports. The economic impact of sports stadiums and arenas ends up being much smaller than originally estimated."
The latest report estimates that a West Side stadium with a grass field would attract 3.9 million people a year to 81 games and 12 concerts or other events, 600,000 more than Peat Marwick estimated. The project would generate $41.7 million annually in taxes and 9,442 jobs, the report says.
The Peat Marwick report, however, said that the stadium would generate 1,600 jobs, while the state and city would reap $5 million in taxes.

HEADLINE: Texas Business Foundation To Pay for School Vouchers

BYLINE: By CAROL MARIE CROPPER 

DATELINE: DALLAS, April 22

 BODY:
A foundation started by business leaders in San Antonio announced today that it would provide $50 million for a voucher program to allow poor students in one city district to attend private or parochial schools over the next 10 years.
Under the program, any student who qualifies for the Federal lunch program -- 93 percent in the district do -- will be eligible for up to $3,600 a year through eighth grade and up to $4,000 a year in high school to attend a private school within the Edgewood Independent School District, which has 14,000 students. 
 If they choose to attend private school outside the district, beginning in the 1998-1999 school year, the students would receive slightly less money in what would become the nation's largest privately financed school voucher program.
The district, with a largely Hispanic population of about 40,000, includes at least four private schools whose tuition ranges from about $1,000 to $3,000. Although other business leaders around the country have provided the families of poor children with the money to attend private school, the San Antonio effort is the first to provide tuition for an entire district.
The scholarships will "raise the bar for everyone" and, the business leaders hope, will promote economic development in the district, said Robert Aguirre, the managing director of the Children's Educational Opportunity Foundation, which is providing the $50 million and which has been financing some district students since it was founded in 1992 by business leaders who support vouchers as a way to force public schools to improve.
The money is being provided by one of the organization's founders, James Leininger, a doctor who started Kenetic Concepts, a company that makes hospital beds, and by the C.E.O America Foundation, a national umbrella group for local voucher programs.
Fritz Steiger, president of C.E.O. America, which says it has more than 500 corporate and individual contributors across the country, said he expected educational researchers to focus on Edgewood to see the effects of a voucher program.
But opponents like the Texas Federation of Teachers, the teachers' union, said it believed that the vouchers would allow private schools to select the best students.
"It shortens the honor roll," John O'Sullivan, secretary-treasurer of the union told The Associated Press. "One of the strengths of the public school system is is puts everyone together."
Others say the vouchers would drain money from public schools.
"I'm very concerned because it will have a major impact on the district's providing a good education for the entire population that we still have," said Dolores Munoz, superintendent of the Edgewood district.
The district's schools have been improving with changes made in the last five or six years, Dr. Munoz said, adding, "We don't have any low-performing schools."
Last year, of the district's 27 schools, 6 won the Texas Successful Schools award for academic improvement and 2 were recognized for high test scores, said Edna Prez-Vega, a district spokeswoman.
Because of the improvements and parental support, Dr. Munoz predicted that fewer than 500 students would take the scholarships -- a number that she said the system could adjust to. If the departures grow closer to 1,000, she said, it could lead to teacher layoffs and school closings.
Edgewood was not chosen because it was the city's worst school district, Mr. Aguirre said, but because it was small enough to make a concentrated effort where results could be measured but large enough to make a difference.
Clint Bolick, litigation director for the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit organization based in Washington that provides legal assistance to advocates of school vouchers, said opponents would have a tough time challenging the legality of the Edgewood experiment because it is financed with private money.
"Edgewood," Mr. Bolick said, "could be as important for the school choice movement as Little Rock was for the school desegregation movement."

HEADLINE: City Now Puts Budget Surplus At Record High Of $2 Billion

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
New York will end its fiscal year with a surplus of more than $2 billion, the largest ever recorded by the city and $800 million more than the Giuliani administration predicted just three months ago, officials said yesterday.
Despite the surplus -- largely the result of the continuing boom on Wall Street -- officials said the money would not be used to vastly expand spending in the $34 billion budget that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will present tomorrow. Joseph J. Lhota, the Mayor's budget director, said that most of the money would be set aside to reduce future budget gaps, with the rest going to spending increases and tax cuts. 
 Among those cuts could be a reduction in the personal income tax, Mr. Lhota said. But he declined to specify how big a cut the Mayor might propose.
The idea was first proposed in January by Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, and at first Mr. Giuliani strongly rejected it. But since then, the Mayor has expressed a willingness to negotiate the issue with Mr. Vallone. And now Mr. Vallone has an added bit of leverage: he holds what amounts to veto power over the Mayor's plan to use a business tax to help finance a new ballpark for the New York Yankees.
The surplus is the second in a row for New York City; last year's amount was $1.4 billion. In January, when he presented his first draft of next year's budget, Mr. Giuliani had predicted that the surplus for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, would be $1.2 billion.
But the city government has received unusually strong tax revenues in the last three months, prompting it to re-estimate the size of its surplus.
"Our estimate is that approximately 50 percent of the increase is coming from Wall Street," Mr. Lhota said.
Alan G. Hevesi, the City Comptroller, said that the continuing bull market, large bonuses on Wall Street and the tourist boom could push the projected surplus even higher.
"This is still a conservative number," Mr. Hevesi said of the $2 billion figure. "There's no reason this boom won't be sustained over some period of time."
The Giuliani administration released few details about the final budget that it would propose for the 1999 fiscal year, except to say that the breakdown of the surplus would hew to the plan proposed in January. Back then, Mr. Giuliani said that he wanted to spend the surplus by devoting 8 percent of it to make up for revenues lost to tax cuts; 19 percent for new spending, mostly for educational and anti-drug programs, and 73 percent to close future budget gaps.
Despite the substantial surpluses this year and last, budget gaps are expected to occur because the city's spending is growing faster than its revenues. Budget officials anticipate a $1.5 billion deficit for fiscal year 2000 and a $2.1 billion gap for the following year. The city is legally bound to balance its books every year.
Although most experts praised the spending plan that Mr. Giuliani presented in January, others said that he should have used much more of the surplus to retire some of the city's $30 billion in outstanding debt. (The city will use $50 million of the surplus to do so, Mr. Lhota said.)
Dean Mead, a senior researcher at the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said Mr. Giuliani was wasting an opportunity to make a sizable reduction in the outstanding debt. Mr. Mead added that the city is also underestimating the size of future budget gaps, because it is not accounting for wage increases that would be counted in new contracts with city workers in the year 2001.
The draft the Mayor presented in January included spending increases of 3 to 4 percent -- slightly more than the local inflation rate -- and the final proposal is likely to have similar increases.
After the Mayor presents his final plan, it goes to the City Council for approval. Given Mr. Vallone's fiscally conservative record, the Council is not expected to press for spending on new programs, despite the huge surplus. But one likely subject of negotiation is cutting taxes.
In January, Mr. Vallone urged that a 12.5 percent surcharge on the city's personal income tax -- approved in 1990 to help the city balance its books and reauthorized in 1991 to help hire thousands of new police officers -- should be allowed to expire at the end of the year. Linking himself to a tax cut is an important goal for Mr. Vallone, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor.
Mr. Giuliani, who favors eliminating the sales tax on clothes, opposed Mr. Vallone's suggestion; both sides agreed that the city cannot afford to cut both.
Two weeks ago, the State Legislature rejected Mr. Giuliani's request to do away with the clothing tax, instead eliminating it only for clothing items under $110.
Thomas L. McMahon, the Council's finance director, said he believed that the Council had the upper hand now because the Legislature had rejected the Mayor's proposal. "We look forward to negotiating a tax program with the Mayor in the best interest of the city," Mr. McMahon said.
Mr. Lhota said yesterday that on Friday the Mayor "will be presenting a personal income tax reduction as well," but he did not provide specifics.

New Office for Sumitomo

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Anticipating an increase in the number of Japanese executives seeking to buy or rent homes in Fairfield County, Conn., Sumitomo Real Estate Sales of New York will open a five-person office in Greenwich on May 1, the company said yesterday.
About 35 percent of the Japanese nationals working in the metropolitan area live in either Fairfield or Westchester County, said Hirofumi Murabayashi, a spokesman for the Consulate General of Japan. Sumitomo also has an office in Scarsdale, employing 12 people. Last year, about 85 percent of its real estate transactions involved Japanese clients, said John J. Gilmore, a spokesman for the real estate company. 
 Sumitomo recently represented Asahi Breweries U.S.A., the Japanese beer company, in negotiations to lease space for an East Coast sales office at 11 Martin Street in White Plains. The office will employ a dozen people, two of them from the company's Milwaukee headquarters.
After declining slightly for several years, the Japanese population in the New York metropolitan region increased 5 percent from 1995 to 1997, the latest year for which figures are available, and is now about 55,000, Mr. Murabayashi said. He said the economic problems in Japan were partly responsible for the rise.
Mr. Murabayashi said he expected a growing number of executives from his country to choose the suburbs over the city, even though they are used to living in cramped apartments. "Because of that, when we are assigned to a foreign country, we want to live in a house," he said. "We want to make it different." TERRY PRISTIN

HEADLINE: Profits More Robust Than Expected at UAL and US Airways

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, and US Airways Group reported first-quarter earnings yesterday that exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates. A third carrier, Trans World Airlines, reported a loss slightly greater than estimates.
In releasing its results, UAL warned that second-quarter earnings would fall short of analysts' estimates because of continuing weak demand for travel in Asia. 
 The Chicago-based UAL earned $61 million, or 34 cents a fully diluted share, down 42 percent from $105 million, or 92 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
On a fully distributed basis, the company earned $218 million, or $1.68 a share -- greater than the average estimate of $1.55 a share reported by the First Call Corporation, an investment research firm. On the same basis, UAL earned $215 million, or $1.61 a share, in the comparable quarter in 1997. The fully distributed earnings figures assume all shares owed to employees are distributed, excluding employee stock compensation. UAL employees own 55 percent of the airline.
UAL said it compensated for problems in Asia by suspending some flights in the region and cutting costs throughout the company. Like other airlines, it also got a boost from the lowest fuel prices in almost a decade, a cut in commissions paid to travel agents and rising business fares.
Still, the economic crisis in Asia reduced UAL's pretax operating profit by about $75 million, compared with the quarter a year earlier, Douglas Hacker, the chief financial officer, said.
United said it expected to earn "slightly less" in the second quarter than the average First Call estimate of $3.07 a share. It said it still expected to "slightly exceed" analysts' full-year estimate of $10.26 a share, helped by the strong United States economy and low fuel prices.
"The bottom line is that Asia is holding back the upside at United," said Glenn Engel, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company.
US Airways Group said first-quarter earnings fell 36 percent, to $98.3 million, or 96 cents a diluted share, from $152.7 million, or $1.45, in the quarter a year earlier. Still, the gains topped the 94-cent estimate in a survey by First Call.
US Airways, based in Arlington, Va., had warned analysts that its costs would increase this year as tax breaks expired and its accounting tax rate rose to 40 percent, from 8 percent last year.
The company also said yesterday that it had postponed a plan to begin serving Gatwick Airport in London from its hub in Charlotte, N.C., bowing for now to British Government in a dispute over landing rights.
US Airways says the off-hour slots that the British authorities have offered would make it impossible for the airline to compete effectively for passenger traffic. The airline had planned to begin the service May 7.
The first-quarter loss at Trans World Airlines narrowed from the comparable quarter a year earlier as the airline cut expenses.
The company, based in St. Louis, reported a loss yesterday of $55.5 million, compared with a loss of $71.6 million in the 1997 quarter. Before one-time charges, it had an operating loss of $54.1 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with $70.0 million, or $1.49, in the period a year earlier. T.W.A. was expected to earn 75 cents a share in the quarter, according to First Call.
The airline, which has been in bankruptcy court twice since 1992, is attempting to raise profits by increasing passengers per plane and by attracting more high-fare business fliers while cutting overall costs. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 24, 1998, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article by Bloomberg News in Business Day yesterday about the first-quarter results for three airline companies misstated the figure Wall Street analysts had forecast for Trans World Airlines. The prediction of 75 cents a share for the quarter was for a loss, not a profit. (On Wednesday, T.W.A. reported a loss of 76 cents a share.)

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S CHOICE/Film;
Finnish Fortitude Behind the Despair

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
The Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki, one of Europe's most celebrated directors, has described the continuing theme in many of his films as "the extraordinary phenomenon that is mistakenly described as Finnish national character, in other words the peculiar desire for self-destruction that haunts this semi-Western, semi-Slavic nation, something that's not without its comic aspects."
That mood of fatalistic gloom, and its deadpan comic side, haunts Mr. Kaurismaki's 1997 film, "Drifting Clouds," which is having its first American showings tonight at 8 at the Museum of Modern Art and on May 2 at 3 P.M. "Drifting Clouds" is one of the high points in the series "Baby It's Cold Outside: Films From Finland, 1917-1997," which begins today at the museum and continues through May 31. 
 The film's dour, neo-realist portrayal of contemporary Finland suggests a country whose middle class is struggling to maintain a foothold, where alcoholism is rampant, and where economic jitters have contributed to a bitter social climate in which petty corruption flourishes. Within a space of days, a couple who have just bought their first television set on the installment plan lose their jobs through downsizing. The husband is a streetcar driver whose route is suddenly canceled, his wife the head waiter at a restaurant that is sold to new management.
"Drifting Clouds" follows these two decent, hard-working people through their humiliating rounds of job hunting. When the husband finds work driving a tour bus to St. Petersburg, the future briefly looks bright until he flunks his medical exam. The wife takes a job in a grubby little diner in which she is both chef (on a hot plate) and waitress. The job ends in disaster.
Neo-realist in attitude but highly stylized with its washed-out colors, wan wintry light and a foreboding expressionistic sense of the characters' profound isolation from one another in tormented private worlds, the movie builds a mood of haunting despair before it takes a sudden 90-degree turn near the end and suggests that pluck pays off.
"Drifting Clouds" is the most recent film in this series, a sweeping history of Finnish cinema that includes 32 movies, most of which are having their American premieres. The oldest film in the series is "Traveling in the Arctic," Sakari Palsi's 18-minute silent movie from 1917, which is a documentary about explorers adrift in the Bering Strait.
Like the couple in "Drifting Clouds," Finnish cinema has survived and even flourished on hardiness and pluck, a quality called "sisu," which, loosely translated, means guts.
"Baby, It's Cold Outside: Films From Finland, 1917-1997" runs through May 31. "Drifting Clouds" can be seen tonight at 8 and on May 2 at 3 P.M. Tickets free with admission: $9.50, $6.50, students and the elderly. The Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan (212) 708-9400.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Clinton Policies Explained

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Sometimes critical Americans complain that human rights policies of the United States have become so peculiar that there is no understanding what the Clinton Administration is doing or why.
That is not fair. If those critics would apply the perspective of the Administration, everything would be clear. Allow me to help. 
 One spring day this year the U.S. withdrew its annual U.N. resolution criticizing the Chinese Communist Government for its human rights abuses. Good show, said our allies.
But a couple of weeks later, the U.S. again put forward its annual resolution critical of Cuba on human rights. For the first time, the resolution was defeated, by third-world, Communist, former Communist and dictatorial countries; some are all in one.
Our Western allies voted for the U.S. resolution although they do business with Fidel and are always scolding away at the U.S. for its embargo against Cuba.
Think hard and one perspective will come to you in a snap of inspiration. Money talks!
President Clinton abandoned the resolution critical of Beijing because business has persuaded him that hundreds of billions in trade can be scooped up in China.
Now it happens that America loses about $50 billion a year in its trade balance with China. Chinese seem more keen on getting U.S. money than giving us theirs. Still, some U.S. companies do make money; do not get unpleasant with questions about which American hides are aching from the trade losses.
So, what with a Clinton trip to Beijing coming up and Communist warnings about getting impudent about human rights, drop goes the resolution.
Cuba: Many Clintonians want to do business with Fidel. Anti-Castro Cubans in America have the gall to fight for their convictions. But Cuban trade would be a drop compared with the dream profits in China. So let people say the U.S. now only picks human rights quarrels with small or poor countries; who cares?
But surely money does not determine willingness to fight religious persecution of Christians and other hounded minorities? No, not just money.
The Administration is struggling fiercely to destroy a morally powerful but economically mild bill against religious persecution. The bill would cut out U.S. taxpayer money for non-humanitarian aid and for loans to persecuting countries. The President would be on the spot -- agree or waive the penalty.
Representative Frank Wolf and Senator Arlen Specter, both Republicans, introduced the bill. Recently it won a major bipartisan committee vote in the House, 31 to 5, under the helpful chairmanship of Benjamin Gilman, Republican of New York.
The Administration will fight until the final House vote, and in the Senate, where water-down efforts are likely. For a documented lesson in how the Administration, lobbyists and business organize against the bill, see a dissection by Ken Silverstein in Mother Jones, current issue.
Money is involved -- the trade threats of Beijing. But now, thanks to Secretary of State Albright, we can understand Clintonian political philosophy, too. In a speech knifing Wolf-Specter she said:
"Even the most patriotic among us must admit that neither morality nor religious freedom nor respect for human rights were invented here -- nor are they perfectly practiced here. . . . If we are to be effective in defending the values we cherish, we must also take into account the perspectives and values of others."
Moral equivalency. We heard it raised against fighting South African apartheid, against fighting female genital mutilation and, not terribly long ago, against freeing slaves.
What "perspectives and values" must we take into account about religious persecution -- the value of arrest, torture, forced labor, the perspective of the Communist bureaucrats and police who oversee the "patriotic" churches where Chinese Protestants and Catholics must worship if they want to stay out of prison?
Or the perspectives of governments that do not permit Christians to worship openly at all, as in Saudi Arabia, or make war against them, spelled Sudan?
Most Americans, I believe, prefer the perspectives and values of Wolf-Specter and of politicians, churches and organizations that are creating a conservative-liberal coalition for religious and political rights -- which thrive together or die together.

RJR Nabisco Posts 16% Drop in First-Quarter Earnings

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
The RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation reported a 16 percent drop in first-quarter earnings yesterday, attributing the decline to economic troubles in Asia and Brazil, a stronger dollar, higher marketing costs and increased legal expenses from the proposed tobacco litigation settlement.
For the three months ended March 31, RJR said net income fell to $179 million, or 52 cents a diluted share, from $213 million, or 62 cents, a year ago. Revenue rose 4 percent, to $3.95 billion from $3.78 billion. 
 The results were in line with Wall Street's diminished expectations, and RJR shares fell 25 cents, to $28.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
"We do expect performance to improve as we move through the year, but we expect little change in the full-year results versus last year, excluding the impact of foreign-exchange translation," said Steven F. Goldstone, the company's chairman and chief executive.
A stronger dollar makes American products more expensive abroad and means corporate profits earned in foreign currencies translate into relatively fewer dollars.
Analysts said the company's tobacco sales grew impressively in some areas, like Romania, where they more than doubled. But overall tobacco earnings fell 11 percent, from $575 million last year to $513 million this year.
"While there was extremely good volume and market-share growth in Eastern Europe and Russia, it did not translate into greater profits," said Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
Earnings by the domestic tobacco business declined 11 percent, partly because of the increased costs of marketing the Winston brand, which was repositioned in the second half of 1997 with a "No Bull" ad campaign that is generally considered a success. Legal costs associated with the proposed tobacco settlement "outweighed higher selling prices," the company said.
On the food side, earnings decreased from $253 million to $238 million this year. Sales of several products in the cookie-and-cracker division remain soft, and major problems exist with a Brazilian dairy business owned by Nabisco, analysts said.
Food earnings from abroad fell 41 percent, from $54 million to $32 million, although sales rose slightly, from $577 million to $582 million. "It's hard to look at these international earnings without believing that Dr. Kilts will have to perform surgery, particularly on the Brazilian milk business," said John McMillin, a food analyst with Prudential Securities. He referred to James M. Kilts, the president and chief executive of Nabisco Holdings Corporation, who is not a medical doctor.
In the United States though, the company faces other problems, notably its weakened sales of hot cereals -- attributed to an unusually mild winter -- but also the slump suffered by products like the low-fat Snackwell's line of cookies and snacks.
"Their whole cookie business is down compared to Keebler's," said Emanuel Goldman, an industry analyst with Paine Webber in San Francisco. "It's extraordinary. For RJR's cookie business to be losing share is like the canary eating the cat."

HEADLINE: $6.15 Minimum Wage Approved in Hartford

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 23

 BODY:
In the state with the highest per-capita income, lawmakers today passed a measure aimed at helping Connecticut's low-income workers: they raised the minimum wage.
The measure, which Gov. John G. Rowland has promised to sign, will raise Connecticut's hourly minimum wage to $6.15 by the year 2000, a dollar above the $5.15 minimum wage set by the Federal Government last September. The increase will give Connecticut the second-highest minimum wage in the country. 
 Although some Republicans expressed concern today that the measure would hurt small businesses and eliminate the jobs of some low-income workers, Democrats disagreed and said that as the economy improves, those in the bottom-income brackets deserve to benefit.
State Representative Christopher G. Donovan, a Democrat from Meriden, who was the measure's chief proponent, said that Connecticut's poverty rate tripled, to 10.7 percent from 3.5 percent, between 1989 and 1996. "We need to halt this decline of our working people and stop this slide into poverty," Mr. Donovan said.
"It's time we give hard work its due," he added.
The measure raises Connecticut's $5.18 minimum wage to $5.65 on Jan. 1, 1999, and to $6.15 on Jan. 1, 2000.
The measure passed this year without the partisan wrangling that occurred two years ago when Democrats tried to pass a similar bill. At that time, Mr. Rowland threatened to veto a minimum-wage measure, and Senate Democrats staged an hours-long filibuster when Republicans, who then controlled the Senate, refused to bring the bill to a vote.
A spokeswoman for United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, Mr. Rowland's likely Democratic opponent in the governor's race this year, said Mrs. Kennelly was pleased that the minimum-wage bill passed. But she said that Mr. Rowland's earlier opposition to the bill indicates that his change of position was election-year politics.
"I wonder if he would have made this decision if we weren't 28 weeks before the election," the spokeswoman, Lisa K. Cutler, said today.
Dean C. Pagani, Mr. Rowland's spokesman, said the Governor would sign the bill because the economy is healthier than it was two years ago, even though he still feels that the minimum wage should be set by the Federal Government.
The House passed the bill 124 to 23 today, and the Senate passed it 27 to 8 on April 2.
The move comes as Congress is considering raising the minimum wage and at least two other states, Massachusetts and Washington, are considering ways to increase the minimum wage there.
Only six other states and the District of Columbia have a minimum wage higher than the Federal standard, said Edward B. Lazere, a policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington advocacy group that researches government policy affecting low-income people. Oregon is the only state whose minimum wage will remain above Connecticut's after this measure fully takes effect; Oregon's current minimum is $6 per hour, and is scheduled to rise to $6.50 in January 1999, Mr. Lazere said.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Higher in Mid-April

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
New claims for jobless benefits rose 29,000 in mid-April to the highest level in two months, erasing sharp declines from the previous week, the Labor Department said today.
Government figures showed 317,000 newly idled workers filed for unemployment insurance benefits at state offices around the country in the week that ended last Saturday, exceeding economists' forecast for 308,000 claims for the week. 
 In the previous week, new applications were revised downward to 288,000 from 289,000, the lowest since 276,000 in late July, the Labor Department said.
But the department was still unclear whether the drop was linked to Passover and Easter holidays falling at the end of the week in which many applicants may have delayed filing claims. It was not a Federal holiday.

HEADLINE: Iraq Again Threatens to Halt Arms Inspections

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 23

 BODY:
President Saddam Hussein made his most direct threat today to provoke another crisis over arms inspections unless an economic embargo on Iraq is lifted next week by the United Nations Security Council.
The United States would "pay dearly" for not heeding the warning, a statement from the Iraqi Cabinet said. Last November, Iraq threatened to stop all cooperation with the arms inspections by May, and some officials here fear the Iraqis may follow through on that threat if events in the Council do not go their way. 
 The Cabinet statement, issued in Baghdad after a meeting presided over by President Hussein, came as the Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, formally demanded in a letter to the Security Council that sanctions be lifted "immediately without any new restrictions or conditions." The letter was sent to Hisashi Owada, Japan's representative and this month's Council president.
Mr. Aziz dismissed the latest report from the United Nations Special Commission -- the arms inspectors -- which criticized Iraq for withholding information on arms programs, as full of "tremendous and flagrant fallacies and lies."
Iraq will get an opportunity to deliver its message directly to Council members on Monday in an informal session requested by Russia, which may also propose that intrusive inspections for nuclear weapons in Iraq be stopped and replaced by passive monitoring, diplomats said. The International Atomic Energy Agency reported last week that Iraq had successfully accounted for most of its nuclear program.
Iraq would like help from its friends, particularly Russia and France, in finding ways to whittle down the power of the inspection process, assuming that sanctions remain, diplomats said. Today at a House subcommittee hearing in Washington, Bill Richardson, the United States representative at the United Nations, said without elaborating that he expected to face "efforts to weaken the disarmament provisions of the Security Council resolution."
James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said in an interview that Iraq should have learned that there can be no quick technical fixes to hasten the end of sanctions, which were imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
"Unfortunately Iraq continues to make threats instead of coming clean with the requirements of U.N. Security Council resolutions," Mr. Rubin said. "Sanctions will stay on, as long as Iraq continues to flout U.N. resolutions. That is not the view of the United States; that is the view of all the members of the Security Council."
Mr. Rubin noted that a military force remained in the Persian Gulf area and said the United States was still prepared to use it.
In his letter to the Council, Mr. Aziz accused the commission's executive chairman, Richard Butler of Australia, with conducting a political vendetta against Iraq while gathering intelligence for Washington.
United Nations and Clinton Administration officials expected Iraq to press for a lifting of sanctions before the end of the year.
But few expected the high-pitched campaign to force a debate now, during the first major review of sanctions since the crisis in January and February that brought the United States and Iraq close to war.
To a large extent, Iraq is using familiar tactics: attacking Mr. Butler while testing the level of support the United States will have in the Council. The Iraqi move comes only a few months after Washington failed to win much backing for a military attack during the last crisis.
The last unalloyed United States victory in the Council occurred last fall, when a resolution was passed that demanded a ban on international travel by senior Iraqi officials. That resolution has never been put into effect: the Foreign Minister, Mohammed Said al-Sahaf, and the Oil Minister, Amir Mohammed Rashid, are in New York for the Security Council meetings.
On Monday the Security Council begins one of two comprehensive reviews of sanctions scheduled for this year; the second is planned for October. Diplomats and United Nations officials have assumed the sanctions would be continued during the current review.
In his 22-page letter to Mr. Owada, Mr. Aziz demanded a public hearing of all charges against Baghdad to permit Iraqi officials to clear up any outstanding issues.
The Iraqis also hoped to do this during "technical experts' meetings" that were called earlier this year at Baghdad's request to get an independent review of evidence. They were disappointed when experts from a wide range of countries -- including some on the Council sympathetic to Iraq -- wrote reports similar to that of Mr. Butler, who said last week that there had been no progress in the last six months in closing files on biological, chemical or missile programs.
Under Council resolutions, when files are closed the United Nations can continue to monitor Iraq but can no longer conduct intrusive inspections at will. A complex high-technology monitoring system is in place, but it is lightly guarded and could be easily seized or disabled by Iraq.
Mr. Aziz said Iraq objects to Mr. Butler's reluctance to accept Baghdad's declarations of compliance.
"In more than one part of the report," Mr. Aziz wrote of Mr. Butler's account, "the executive chairman attacks Iraq's statements and declarations that it no long has prohibited weapons, mentioning the expression 'in contrast with the evidence available.' "
Mr. Aziz says that to demand verification while withholding evidence "is a police procedure, and not one pertaining to the work of the United Nations."
Mr. Butler -- who like his predecessor, Rolf Ekeus, a Swedish diplomat who is now Ambassador to the United States, has presented evidence to Iraq on numerous occasions -- says the Iraqis are trying to claim "disarmament by declaration."

 
 
Iranq Protests Killing
 TEHERAN, Iran, April 23 (Reuters) -- Iran protested to Iraq today over the assassination of a 70-year-old Iranian cleric in the holy city of Najaf in southern Iraq, the Teheran radio said.
It said Iraq's charge d'affaires in Teheran was summoned to the Foreign Ministry over the killing on Tuesday of Sheik Morteza Ali Mohammed Ebrahim Borujerdi.
In London, the Iraqi opposition Al Khoei Foundation accused Iraqi Government agents of shooting Sheik Borujerdi, whom it described as a senior candidate for the position of grand spiritual leader of Shiite Muslims worldwide. The foundation said that there had been two previous attempts on the sheik's life and that Iraqi officials had threatened him if he did not stop leading prayers in public. Iraq reported the killing on Wednesday and blamed the intelligence services of a foreign country, which it did not name.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Corestates Settles Bond Case With U.S. for $3.7 Million

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The Corestates Financial Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to pay $3.7 million to settle Federal allegations that its brokerage firm unit grossly overcharged investors and the Federal and local governments in a series of municipal bond deals in the early 1990's.
The settlement is the first time a financial institution has agreed to pay a fine for "yield burning," what Federal investigators call a fraudulent marking up of bond prices. 
 The settlement -- reached with Securities and Exchange Commission, the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service -- may serve as a formula for future agreements as the Government steps up investigation of municipal bond practices. "Yield burning is a fraud perpetrated on local governments and taxpayers that compromises the integrity of of the municipal securities market," said Arthur Levitt Jr., the S.E.C. chairman. "This case signals to municipal finance professionals that this conduct will be vigorously prosecuted."
In the case, the Government had accused Meridian Securities, a Reading, Pa., brokerage firm that was acquired by Corestates in 1996, of illegally marking up the price of Treasury securities and reselling them to local government agencies in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
In agreeing to the settlement, Corestates did not acknowledge any wrongdoing. The company said it simply wanted to resolve any securities and tax questions related to dozens of Pennsylvania transactions from 1992 to 1995. The deals involved the raising of funds for county and local governments and school districts. "We inherited this controversy," said Thomas Dooney, chief executive of Corestates, whose merger with the First Union Corporation is scheduled to be completed later this month. "We looked at the cost of the settlement versus the good will of our clients and the disruptive effect of multiple litigations. All things considered, we made a rational business decision to put this matter behind us."
The settlement is a victory for the S.E.C., which has accused another firm, Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, of yield burning and is investigating dozens of still other cases involving Wall Street firms.
Federal regulators have been looking into accusations that brokerage firms, big and small, illegally overcharged state and local governments in the early 1990's by selling them Treasury bonds at artificially high prices to make hefty profits.
The scheme worked this way: when interest rates fall, state and local agencies often refinance old debt by issuing new municipal bonds. The proceeds are placed in an escrow account, which by Federal law is usually stocked with Treasury bonds. Firms handling the account typically buy the Treasuries.
But in marking up the prices of Treasuries sold to the state and local governments, some firms, investigators say, thereby lowered, or burned down, the yield -- which moves in the opposite direction of the price -- so that the yield appeared to conform with Federal regulations.
In doing so, those firms may have jeopardized the tax-exempt status of many municipalities and also pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars that the local governments would have otherwise forwarded to the Federal Government.
Some investors had feared that the investigation of such practices would cause the I.R.S. to withdraw the tax-exempt status of some bonds. But because of the settlement announced yesterday, it appeared less likely that the I.R.S. would penalize bondholders.
Yield-burning investigations started in 1994, when Michael R. Lissack, an investment banker at Smith Barney, got in touch with Federal law enforcement officials.
Mr. Lissack, who was dismissed from Smith Barney in 1995, filed under the False Claims Act, which permits any individual with knowledge of fraud against the Federal Government to file a suit and, if successful, to recover a percentage of the damages. Indeed, it was Mr. Lissack's False Claims suit that brought the Justice Department into a yield-burning case that was being handled by the S.E.C., which regulates financial markets, and the I.R.S., which was seeking to recover money it believed it had been denied.
Because the Justice Department joined the case, Mr. Lissack -- who had earlier filed claims against Lazard Freres and many other firms for yield-burning practices -- could recover 15 to 25 percent of the Corestates settlement of $3.4 million to the Treasury. Corestates was ordered to pay a further $420,000 to two Pennsylvania municipalities.
The S.E.C. said yesterday that it had also reached a settlement with Martin J. Stallone, who worked on many of the bond deals for Corestates. Mr. Stallone was ordered to pay $100,000 to the Treasury and a $15,000 civil penalty and was suspended from the securities industry for a year.
Steven T. Snyder, head of Meridian's public finance department during most of the deals, was also charged, but he denied wrongdoing and refused a settlement agreement.
"He categorically denies that he violated securities laws," said Mr. Snyder's lawyer, Michael Mixell. "Everything he did was in accordance with corporate policy and with the knowledge of his supervisors."
In Treasury trading yesterday, prices ended lower for the fourth straight session. The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 9/32, to 102 1/32, pushing its yield up to 5.98 percent from 5.96 percent Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Atlanta Mayor Ousts Airport Chief and Hires Newark Official

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, April 23

 BODY:
Mayor Bill Campbell today dismissed the well-regarded but tenaciously independent general manager of the city's bustling airport, the second busiest in the world, and appointed the general manager of Newark's airport to replace her.
Mr. Campbell, a Democrat who was elected to a second term last year, said he did not dismiss the manager, Angela Gittens, because of any dissatisfaction with her performance. Rather, he said, the planned expansion of Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport demands a different style of leadership, and the new manager, Benjamin R. DeCosta, is better suited to the task. 
 But aides to Mr. Campbell and other officials familiar with the operation of the airport said the Mayor had grown frustrated with Ms. Gittens's unyielding style and her refusal to take direction from City Hall. They said she had alienated important political leaders, airport concessionaires, and officials of leading airlines, including the airport's leading carrier, Delta Air Lines, which is based in Atlanta.
"The Mayor's got to feel comfortable with his people," said a mayoral aide, who noted that Ms. Gittens was appointed in 1993 by Mr. Campbell's predecessor, Maynard H. Jackson.
Ms. Gittens, a 51-year-old native of New York City, could not be reached for comment today.
Mr. Campbell refused to critique Ms. Gittens at a news conference today, calling her "a very able airport director" who had "done a good job." He also denied that he had any professional disagreements with her and said it was "absolute nonsense" to say she had been too independent. But the Mayor also made a point of repeatedly extolling Mr. DeCosta as a "consummate diplomat."
"Let me use a sports analogy," Mr. Campbell said. "Sometimes teams trade their stars when they decide to embark on a different course. The need for the airport over the last four years has been rebuilding. The need over the next few years is expansion. It's my belief that Ben DeCosta has a particular skill set that will allow him to be a diplomat in negotiations with our neighbors as well as in working closely with the airlines in making this expansion process a reality."
That being said, Ms. Gittens had, by all accounts, including Mr. Campbell's, compiled an impressive record. And so the Mayor's move provoked puzzlement and disappointment by many political and business leaders, particularly given that Ms. Gittens had a reputation for competence in an administration that has suffered severe management problems in areas like finance and sewage disposal.
Ms. Gittens effectively cleaned up the debris left by a major bribery scandal that resulted in the convictions of several City Council members and airport concessionaires. She oversaw $250 million in renovations before the 1996 Summer Olympics, and won widespread praise for the airport's handling of 3.6 million travelers during the Games. She also directed the planning for the construction of a fifth runway and has started the process of studying future expansion.
A number of City Council members and business leaders said today that they had encouraged Mr. Campbell to retain Ms. Gittens after hearing several months ago that he was considering dismissing her.
"I admired her integrity and strength of character, putting the city and the citizens and the airport first," said Councilwoman Julia Emmons, the chairwoman of the transportation committee. "I had let the Mayor know how I felt."
Another Council member, Doug Alexander, said he probably would vote against Mr. DeCosta's confirmation in protest. "I don't know Mr. DeCosta but he will be more beholden to the Mayor and I don't like that," he said. "I think what he's done here is taken somebody who's shown incredible leadership and vision and just tossed her aside."
Sam A. Williams, president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, said he, too, was disappointed that Ms. Gittens would be leaving. "The business leadership that deals with Hartsfield was impressed with her," he said.
Several City Council members said today that they were also impressed with Mr. DeCosta, who won plaudits at Newark International Airport for diminishing long flight delays, overseeing speedy construction projects and reducing car thefts in airport parking lots.
"If the Mayor had tried to appoint some ex-Council member or some old friend of his, it might have been a problem," said Councilman Vern McCarty. "I think he made some points today by appointing a person who seems to have excellent credentials and qualifications for the job."
Atlanta's airport has long been central to the rapid economic expansion of the region in the last three decades. With 68.2 million passengers in 1997 its volume was second only to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The airport and its carriers, vendors and related businesses employ 35,000 people, with an annual payroll of $1.55 billion.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Snubs White House On Billions For the I.M.F.

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
Congressional Republican leaders dropped the Administration's request for $18 billion for the International Monetary Fund from a popular spending bill today, delivering a potentially fatal blow to one of President Clinton's top foreign policy goals.
Supporters of the financing had hoped Congress might vote on it by the end of this month. But today's decision, made at a stormy hourlong meeting of House and Senate Republican leaders, removed the funds from a fast-moving legislative train, delaying any vote at least until next month. 
 The House and Senate have each approved vastly different versions of the bill, which provides emergency military spending and disaster relief. The Senate bill includes the financing, which is intended to replenish the Fund's capital after it was drained by the Asian economic crisis; the House bill does not. Republican leaders met today to determine which approach to take.
When supporters of the Fund in the House tried to reverse the decision, both sides rolled out their heavy artillery.
"We have an obligation to the people of America to look critically at the International Monetary Fund," Speaker Newt Gingrich said.
The Administration, however, has argued that the Asian crisis is hurting American exports to the region. "The crisis in Asia isn't over and every delay with respect to the I.M.F. is taking an extra risk," said a senior Administration official.
The new financing for the Fund was not intended to aid countries currently in crisis, but to bolster resources to contain future economic malaise.
The action today could send a message around the globe. The Fund's members agreed last year to increase their contributions, but because the United States is the largest contributor, other nations await a cue from Congress.
Mr. Gingrich promised a vote on the financing later this year, but only after the House holds hearings on the Fund and sets conditions on the release of the financing. The conditions are expected to include greater accountability by the I.M.F., which has kept many documents about its internal operations secret.
But in the first major test vote tonight, the House rejected a Democratic-led procedural maneuver to reverse the earlier decision to drop the financing provision. The vote was 222 to 186, with 28 Democrats joining 193 Republicans and an independent in opposing the motion; 22 Republicans voted with 164 Democrats in favor.
"The longer we delay, the greater the likelihood is that the problem deepens and widens," said Representative James A. Leach, Republican of Iowa, who heads the House Banking Committee.
Senate supporters of the financing tried to improve the measure's prospects last month by attaching it to a must-pass bill to pay for military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf, and disaster relief for storm-stricken Americans.
But House Republicans insisted on dealing with the I.M.F. money in a far less popular bill that includes nearly $1 billion in back dues owed to the United Nations. Republicans also vowed to add an anti-abortion provision strongly opposed by Mr. Clinton.
With the House opposition to the Fund threatening to delay approval of the military spending, which the Pentagon says it must get by May 1 or begin laying off thousands of workers, Senate leaders agreed today to drop the I.M.F. financing from House-Senate negotiations next week.
The Senators agreed to this approach, but only if a speedy vote on the new financing was assured. Republicans are sharply divided over the new financing, so it is unclear if and when the House will consider the measure.
"This is not good news," said Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican and I.M.F. supporter who helped steer the bill with the financing to an 84-16 victory in the Senate. "It's a serious problem."
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and his Deputy Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, stepped up their campaign of phone calls to lawmakers, but as one senior lobbyist who has fought for the financing in recent weeks said today, "The momentum seems to be swinging away."
For weeks an unusual coalition of Fund supporters, including business leaders, farmers' groups and bankers, have lobbied legislators to support the new financing.
The approach worked in the Senate but the House was a much tougher sell. Earlier this month, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, urged House Republicans to reject the Administration's request. He argued that the new money would encourage an unchecked expansion of the Fund's lending, costing the United States billions of dollars and weakening world financial markets.

HEADLINE: HEALTH INSURERS SEEK BIG INCREASES IN THEIR PREMIUMS

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
For the first time since 1992, many employers are facing double-digit increases in the cost of their health insurance next year, the highest inflation rate since the majority of employees moved into managed care.
In early negotiations with employers about next year's rates, many insurers are seeking increases for 1999 far above this year's, when most premiums rose in single digits after four years of stability. 
 With such increases, many Americans covered by employee-sponsored health plans may see a larger share of their paychecks go to health insurance or see coverage cut back.
Critics of managed care say the magnitude of the increases undercuts a basic appeal behind managed care: savings from lower costs. The steep proposed increases are reminiscent of the double-digit rises in premiums common before managed care became the health insurance system for most American employees in 1993. Last year, 85 percent of employees were enrolled in managed-care plans.
Some critics say managed-care companies have run out of easy savings and will now have to prove that they can produce high-quality care at reasonable prices. "The low-hanging fruit has been plucked in terms of getting savings by eliminating fat that was in the system," said Margaret Stanley, the health care administrator of the California Public Employees Retirement System.
At least some employers in states including New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois and Minnesota are facing demands for increases of 10 percent or more. Benefits consultants estimate that the increases will average about 7 percent nationally, or five times the current 1.4 percent consumer inflation rate.
In perhaps the most dramatic case, Kaiser Permanente, the nation's largest health maintenance organization, is seeking a 12 percent increase from large employers in California, where it is based.
Managed-care companies say they still offer the best chance of reducing the cost of care because of their ability to monitor the health histories of millions of members, enabling doctors to provide the most cost-effective and highest quality care.
They also point out that rate increases next year are likely to be even bigger for the minority of employees covered by traditional insurance plans, known as fee-for-service, in which patients pay more costs out of their own pockets and are partly reimbursed later. Some managed-care insurers are also raising prices to compensate for huge losses in 1997. Others defend rate increases by arguing that their costs are growing, especially for prescription drugs, as they bow to consumer demands for more services and fewer restrictions.
Oxford Health Plans, the managed-care giant based in Norwalk, Conn., and Kaiser belatedly discovered embarrassing losses for last year. Oxford, Kaiser and other big insurers are spending heavily for computer systems that they say will make their forecasts more accurate and steer physicians toward better medical decisions.
Some insurers say costs are also growing because of costly Government requirements like two-day hospital stays for new mothers and, for Kaiser, structural repairs to protect California hospitals in earthquakes.
Basic costs for health services are rising, fueled by advertisements for drugs like Prozac and several new cholesterol treatments; the introduction of widely used new technology like stents -- tiny metal tubes that prop open clogged arteries -- and insistence by consumers on broad choices among doctors and hospitals. In addition, physicians' incomes are rising again after a one-time decline in 1994.
Managed-care companies are also struggling with higher costs generated by older patients and treatments for chronic illnesses. The Government Medicare and Medicaid programs, meanwhile, have taken steps to slow the growth of payments that were lucrative in some states.
"Many health insurers didn't do a good job of managing care, and now they are bleeding red ink," said Blaine Bos, a principal in Chicago with the William Mercer benefits consulting firm. "The only place they can go is the employer-sponsored health plans."
Employers said many managed-care companies would have to find new ways to contain health costs. Ken Reifert, global benefits director of Merrill Lynch, said managed care had largely been limited to "negotiating discounts and curbing access to higher-priced specialists. We've gone almost as far as we can go in that direction," he said.
"Now the health care companies have to come up with the next rabbit," he said, "and get serious about managing costs and managing quality of care."
Mr. Bos, the consultant, said big employers were likely to see rate increases of 9 percent to 14 percent in most parts of the country.
Individuals and small companies are facing even bigger increases. Kurt Owen, who runs an auto supply retailer in Little Falls, Minn., said his insurance agent warned him to prepare for an increase of at least 15 percent after three years of 6.5 percent raises.
Similarly, a law firm with 20 employees in Kenilworth, N.J., was recently notified by Aetna U.S. Healthcare that monthly premiums would rise 19 percent for single employees and 28 percent for families with children. A spokeswoman for Aetna said such increases could be higher or lower, depending on location, the age of employees and type of coverage.
In New York, the state said it would provide $110 million in subsidies to insurers to keep a lid on requests from Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield and Oxford Health Plans for increases as high as 59 percent for individuals buying their own insurance.
Empire said premiums for large employer groups in its health maintenance organizations would rise 6 percent to 8 percent downstate and 10 percent in the Albany area. For traditional insurance, reflecting costs that typically rise faster than for H.M.O.'s, the increase for large groups in New York will be about 12 percent next year after a 12 percent increase in 1998.
Empire, for example, said its spending for prescription drugs rose 20 percent in 1997. Kaiser said that its drug costs rose 15 percent in California and that the hospital stays of its members were up 4 percent, reversing a three-year decline.
Jack Hudes, a Kaiser vice president, said another problem was a new Government ceiling on payments for Medicare H.M.O.'s that will not cover rising medical costs in California.
But economists said the insurance company increases, if they held up, could ripple through the economy.
Although government employees and workers at big industrial companies typically pay only a small share of premiums, some employers say they may ask their workers to go without a raise in 1999 or pay a larger share of monthly insurance premiums. "Something has to give," said Mr. Owen, the small-business operator in Minnesota.
Two of the biggest health care purchasers in the country, the California Public Employees Retirement System and the Pacific Business Group on Health, denounced the Kaiser increase last week and said it was unacceptable. They said Kaiser had refused to compromise and had threatened to discontinue service to 380,000 California government employees and dependents if they did not pay up.
"When health care premiums go up, it lowers the standard of living for employees," said Ms. Stanley of Calpers.
"This is very frightening news for purchasers and employers, when you think about the other organizations that may see that as an umbrella under which they might ask for increases," said Helen Darling, a consultant in Stamford, Conn., with the Watson Wyatt health care consulting firm.
Kaiser officials said their 1999 increases would be smaller in other regions -- 6.9 percent for Massachusetts employees for 12 months starting in July, for example. But the big H.M.O., which has 9.1 million members nationwide, expects to be recovering losses for "the next couple of years," said Kathy Swenson, a senior vice president with Kaiser. In California, she said, that will mean increases in the "high single digit to potentially low double digits."
Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a Wall Street health care analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said the increases reflected growing national costs -- 3 percent for inflation, 3 percent because more elderly Americans need more medical care, plus 1 percent each for drugs and new technology.

HEADLINE: Newsstand Operators Sue Over New Rules

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
A group of New York City newsstand operators, seeking to block new city regulations that limit the number of adult magazines they can display and sell, filed suit yesterday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.
The newsstand dealers' suit also seeks to block a sharp increase in fees they pay to the city to operate their sidewalk businesses, fees that the operators contend are exorbitant. The new city regulations go into effect today. 
 In papers filed late yesterday, lawyers for the operators contend that both the limit on sexually oriented magazines and the higher fees infringe on the newsstand dealers' constitutional right to distribute published material. If the newsstands exceed the limits, the dealers say, they will be considered adult bookstores, subject to a stringent new zoning law that the city is seeking to use to exclude X-rated businesses from residential neighborhoods and prohibit them from operating within 500 feet of homes, schools, churches and one another.
The news dealers asked the court to declare these provisions -- part of a wider new regulatory plan for the city's approximately 300 sidewalk newsstands -- to be unconstitutional. They also asked that a temporary restraining order be issued to hold off enforcement of the disputed provisions until the court can rule on the merits of the suit.
Judge Allyne R. Ross put off until today a decision on whether to issue the temporary order, said Richard D. Emery, a lawyer for the five Manhattan newsstand operators who brought the suit.
"The imposition of limits on what newsstands can carry violates the news dealers' right to sell what he or she wants," Mr. Emery said in an interview. The new fees also violate this right, his court papers maintain, because the First Amendment to the United States Constitution allows the city to charge news dealers only fees that cover the cost of administering the licensing program. But the new, higher fees are revenue-raising measures "at the expense of free speech," he said.
A lawyer for the city said that although he had not seen the papers filed in the lawsuit, the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani believes that the new regulations do not violate "anybody's First Amendment rights."
"We are aware of a case coming out of Chicago where a Federal appeals court expressly held that there is no First Amendment right to operate a newsstand on a public sidewalk," said the city lawyer, Gabriel Taussig, chief of the administrative law division in the city's Law Department. "While someone does have a First Amendment right to disseminate printed matter, that right doesn't extend to the ability to build a structure on a city sidewalk."
Mr. Emery said that the previous licensing regulations contained no restrictions on the number of adult publications a newsstand could sell and display. The new regulations, he said, in effect limit newsstand sales of adult magazines to less than 40 percent of the stand's total sales and restrict the number of adult magazine displayed to less than 25 percent of display space.
But in an April 14 letter to the New York City Newsstand Operators Association, Randy M. Mastro, the city's Deputy Mayor for operations, said the new newsstand restrictions were needed "to address the possibility that some operators may attempt to circumvent restrictions in the city's new adult-use zoning law by seeking to specialize in the sale of adult magazines from their newsstands."
The lawsuit notes that under the expired system, all street newsstand operators across the city paid $538 a year for their licenses, whereas under the new concession system they will pay $2,500 to $5,000 annually, based on a system of zones that takes into account the location and the amount of traffic there.

HEADLINE: No Ruse Is Too Rash To Get a Reservation;
Desperate Diners Lie, Cheat and Steal To Eat in the Hottest Spots in Town

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The staff of the Grand Tier Restaurant in the Metropolitan Opera House waited expectantly, as it always does, on Paul Newman night.
The actor and his wife, Joanne Woodward, visit several times a season, and Erik Rothman, the tuxedoed manager, had set aside a prime table with a perfect view of the Chagall murals. 
 Placido Domingo was performing that night in "Samson et Dalila," so tables had been booked for weeks at the restaurant, where only operagoers who have paid up to $200 a ticket have the privilege of dining for an average cost of $80 a person.
Promptly at 6 P.M., a nondescript man with black hair sidled up the grand staircase and presented himself to Michelle Tanhoff, the hostess. "I'm Mr. Newman," he said.
"We always wonder whether the real Paul Newman will show up, and we take bets on it," Ms. Tanhoff said. "That night, I lost. It was Mr. Impostor again. He's done this before." (And he got a table every time.)
The faux Newman, whoever he is, is hardly a criminal genius operating in splendid isolation. More and more, maitres d'hotel and restaurateurs say, people will do just about anything to get a table at the hottest restaurants in the nation's most competitive foodie town.
They lie. They cheat. And yes, they steal.
"The chutzpah was incredible," said Jeffrey Toobin, a writer for The New Yorker who arrived at Bouley Bakery on West Broadway last month only to discover that a party of six had, well, fibbed about their name so they could take the table from Mr. Toobin's party of six. The impostors seemed to have read the reservation book upside down and backward. "The restaurant people asked them to give up the table. They refused."
He sighed. "It was one of those possession-is-nine-tenths-of-the-law situations," said Mr. Toobin, a legal analyst who wrote a best-selling book on the O.J. Simpson trial. "We didn't want to make a scene, and finally the restaurant improvised a table for us. All we wanted to do was eat dinner."
Unfortunately, that is all that everyone in New York seems to want to do these days, at least in certain celebrated spots.
"The demand is greater than at any time in the last 20 years," said Tim Zagat, publisher of the Zagat Restaurant and Hotel Surveys. "It's the economic boom. There is strong domestic demand from young financial wizards for whom price is no object, plus strong international demand from those accustomed to paying twice as much for a meal in Europe or Asia."
All that demand has turned getting a reservation into a trial by frustration, and often by busy signal -- for the simply star-struck diner as well as for the plainly larcenous one. To make matters worse, some restaurants will not accept reservations more than 30 days in advance.
And so, scarcity has prompted some to adopt the old end-justifies-the-means mentality, and Mr. Zagat himself could be a poster boy for victimization: dozens of maitres d'hotel have called to tell him that diners have made false reservations under his name. Now when he makes reservations he tells restaurants to confirm with his office.
"I was unprepared for the very great amount of lying," said Alain H. Michel, restaurant director of Jean Georges, the star chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's New French bastion in the Trump International Hotel on Central Park West. "So many people say that they called for a reservation and then claim that we lost it." They feign shock and indignation, he said, when the restaurant does not have the reservation that was never made.
Jean Georges has been forced to treat its reservation holders as if they were Holiday Inn customers: they are required to phone a special line on The Day, validating their call by offering a confirmation number.
These days, the bestiary of shameless restaurant prevaricators includes not only Celebrity Impersonators and Outright Thieves, but also Owners' Best Pals, Name Droppers, Epic Bards, Bribers and Great Intimidators.
The Celebrity Impersonators practice their craft in all manner of ways. Call it lying a la carte. At the Grand Tier, the staff doesn't even know if the pseudo Paul Newman's name really is Paul Newman, "because he always pays in cash," Mr. Rothman said.
Some impersonators have a right to the names they use, though perhaps not to the tables they command.
"We took a reservation asking for a great table for Bill Cosby," said David Ruggerio, chef and owner of Le Chantilly on East 57th Street. "When he arrived, he was obviously not the comedian. But his credit card said he was William Cosby."
And then there are those who have a penchant for appending the words "princess," "duke" and "lord" to their names, which are revealed unadorned on their credit cards. A variant is the secretary-of-the-important-man gambit. "We get lots of calls from people who say, 'I'm calling from the president's office," said Marco Maccioni, a co-owner of Osteria del Circo on West 55th Street. "They never say the president of what."
In Mr. Ruggerio's opinion, impersonators are more forgivable than Outright Thieves, like the group that took Mr. Toobin's table. "These people inch to the front of the line, wait until the maitre d' is gone, then look in the reservation book and pick out a name," he said.
Which has prompted many maitres d'hotel to close the book when they show people to the table. This works only as long as you have the book.
"At Christmastime 1994, someone stole our reservation book," said Jean-Jacques Rachou, owner of La Cote Basque on West 55th Street. "A young man came into the restaurant, asked about a reservation and -- when the maitre d' went to seat someone -- the man left with the book. Maybe he couldn't get in, maybe it was a prank, but it caused a very great confusion at our busy time, and made it so difficult for us to tell who had a reservation."
As always, New York's connivers are using the Owner's Best Pal stratagem -- or, at least, trying to.
Sirio Maccioni, owner of Le Cirque 2000 on Madison Avenue and Marco Maccioni's father, said that "many times people have come up to me and asked for a reservation claiming they are a dear friend of the owner, Sergio," he said with a laugh.
"What am I going to say, 'You are a liar?' No, sometimes I put on my glasses and say, "Oh yes, I'm Sergio, I didn't recognize you."
The Epic Bards are a more exotic group of Outright Liars who spin wondrous fables to get reservations. "We got a frantic call from a C.E.O. who said he was desperate for porterhouse, he was unable to get a reservation in our Minneapolis restaurant, and he was landing his jet soon at Teterboro, so could we fit him in," said Seth D. Bromberg, maitre d'hotel for four years at Morton's of Chicago on East 45th Street, which caters to many captains of industry.
"I thought, 'Who would make up a story like that?' and gave him a table," Mr. Bromberg said. "A few minutes later he came in with his wife. I asked, 'How did you get here so quickly?' and they sheepishly admitted that the story was a ploy. But I was charmed. I think he deserved the table, and he's become a good customer."
Then there are the Epic Bards who never look back. "I told one walk-in that he'd have to wait an hour for a table," Mr. Bromberg said. "He said, 'I can't wait that long.' I asked, 'Why?' He said, 'I only have six months to live, and every moment is precious to me.' How could you not give that guy a table?"
In a way, all of this dirty rotten dishonesty is a backhanded expression of regard. "We are in a service business, and it is our pleasure to be nice to people," Sirio Maccioni said. "The restaurant should be thankful to these people for trying so hard to get in. It would be so much worse if they didn't want to come in."
But restaurant managers draw the line when it comes to bribery and intimidation. "One evening a gentleman arrived at 8 P.M. waving several hundred dollar bills in my face and loudly saying that if I got him a table, then this is for me," Mr. Michel of Jean Georges said with a frown at the sheer tastelessness of the spectacle. "I honestly had absolutely no room for him. What kind of a reputation would we have if we accepted such inducements?"
Maitre d'hotels say that boors offer money in exotic and sometimes hilariously contrived ways, secreting bills between fingers and in their palms "as if they'd seen it done in a bad movie," one manager said.
When lying fails, a not-inconsiderable number of prevaricators and bribers resort to intimidation. Owners and maitres d'hotel report that the Rejected Ones threaten to complain to the Mayor, the Department of Health, the Zagat Survey and even The New York Times.
"We hear a lot of swear words, when we're not hearing weeping," said Josh Goodman, the restaurant manager at Balthazar, a Spring Street retro bistro that gets from 1,000 to 3,000 calls per day and has eight reservation takers to field calls.
The staff has even received death threats. On Valentine's Day, when Balthazar had been totally booked for more than a month, one rejected caller, who had failed to connive his way into the restaurant, said, "I'll be down there, and I'm going to hurt you in ways the likes of which you've never bleeping seen, and then I'm going to bleeping take you out," Mr. Goodman recalled. Perhaps Cupid took pity and intervened.
However skilled they may be at duplicity, New Yorkers hardly have the depth of audacity of Parisians, some of whom have raised celebrity impersonation to the level of art.
"Two months ago I got a call saying that Monsieur Chirac would be coming to dinner," said Jean-Claude Vrinat, owner of Taillevent, an 80-seat restaurant that has had three Michelin stars since 1973, the longest streak of affirmed excellence in Paris.
The request was not unusual, since President Jacques Chirac has been a frequent visitor. "They said he was to be a secret guest, and that we should mention it to no one," Mr. Vrinat said. "But when the party of eight arrived, Monsieur Chirac was not present. We asked where he was, and they said, 'He's coming for coffee.' By then I knew perfectly well that this was untrue. And indeed, M. Chirac never did manage to arrive."

HEADLINE: Senators Endorse Tax Breaks For Education Savings Accounts

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
The Senate today narrowly passed a showcase Republican bill that would provide a modest tax break for parents who save for elementary and secondary school expenses, including private school tuition.
But even as the Senate Republicans tried to seize the education initiative from Democrats, they faced a veto threat from President Clinton on their legislation. 
 The measure passed 56 to 43 on a near party line vote after days of biting partisan debate that displayed the deep differences on education policy. The Republicans want Federal money available for private education, while Democrats fear any subsidy that would reduce commitment to public schooling.
The bill, sponsored by Paul D. Coverdell, Republican of Georgia, and Robert Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, would allow family members, charitable groups or private donors to contribute up to $2,000 a year for each elementary or secondary student into special savings accounts that could be used for education-related expenses, including tutoring, computers and private school tuition.
The interest on the money and withdrawals from the account would be tax free and could be rolled over for college expenses. The accounts, which would cost the Federal government $1.6 billion over 10 years, would be phased out for individuals who make more than $95,000 a year.
Senator Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, called the legislation "revolutionary" while Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, excoriated the bill as an attempt to "privatize education."
The House passed similar legislation last year, and now the two chambers must craft a final bill to send to Mr. Clinton.
With Democrats denouncing the legislation as a first step toward using Federal funds to subsidize private schools, Mr. Clinton this week vowed to veto it. The President has opposed the tax break since last summer, when he threatened to veto the entire balanced budget agreement if Republicans did not remove the provision. They did but vowed to resurrect it.
"It would disproportionately benefit highest-income taxpayers," Mr. Clinton said Tuesday, explaining his expected veto. "Families who are struggling to make ends meet would never see a penny of it."
Today's slim victory indicated that the Senate would not be able to override Mr. Clinton's veto of the bill. Even though the proposal is modest in scope, it gives Republicans a symbolic victory as a well as popular education measure to wield on the campaign trail, one that resonates among middle class parents who send their children to parochial and private schools. And it gives Democrats the chance to portray themselves as the guardians of public education.
The intensity of the debate waged on the floor this week comes at a time when polls show the American public increasingly interested in education as other concerns, such as the economy and the Cold War, have waned. The Democrats have long held the political advantage on the issue, and Mr. Clinton has made education one of the centerpieces of his domestic agenda.
But the Republicans, who just three years ago were trying to eliminate the Department of Education, have tried to recoup with an education agenda of their own. The agenda centers on tuition vouchers that would allow parents to switch their children from public to private schools, an idea that is gaining in grass-roots popularity. Republicans would also like to diminish the Federal government's role in education.
They succeeded in passing two such proposals on Wednesday. By a vote of 50 to 49, the Senate approved an amendment to the tax incentive bill by Senator Coverdell that would convert nearly all Federal money for education programs into block grants for participating states. The Senate also passed a separate provision that would ban voluntary math and reading testing, which Mr. Clinton favors.
"The Federal government has been doing too much dictating for the 7 percent of the resources it gives to the states" for education, Mr. Domenici said.
The two measures were considered so extreme by Democrats, who claimed they would obliterate Federal education policy, that several Democratic supporters of Mr. Coverdell's plan withheld their support. Five Democrats voted for the measure today, but three of them, including Mr. Torricelli, said they would reverse their votes in the future if the amendments were not dropped from the final bill. Three Republicans opposed the bill today.
Democrats put forth 12 of their own amendments, among them Mr. Clinton's ideas to promote school renovation and to hire 100,000 teachers, but none passed.
Throughout the four-day debate, Democrats and Republicans took turns blasting each other's proposals while acknowledging that the nation's schools, and its children, are in trouble.
"The one chance they have to escape the plight that they live in is being denied them because people want to maintain the status quo, and the status quo is bankrupt," said Senator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana.
Senator Kennedy proclaimed that the bill "hangs the sign for all to see on the front door of public schools of America," Mr. Kennedy said. "Abandon hope all ye who enter here. Get out while you can."
One frustrated Democrat complained that the whole debate was nothing but political posturing. "The Senate is busy talking past each other and setting up 30-minute spots for campaigns," said Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts.
Another, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, warned his colleagues: "The public school system ought to shape up or public support will continue to erode."
Mr. Torricelli, who broke with his party to become a lead sponsor, said he believes that Democrats are exaggerating the bill's negative impact on public schools and underestimating its value.
The Democrats, armed with figures from a recent assessment done by the Joint Committee on Taxation, said the annual savings in interest amount to peanuts -- $7 to $37. But Mr. Coverdell preferred to highlight the larger picture. Basing his calculations on a compounded interest rate of 7.5 percent, he said a family that saves $2,000 a year for 10 years would build up $8,294 in interest -- none of it taxed -- and would have an additional $2,322 in tax savings.
He also argued that the measure simply expanded an existing tax break signed into law by the President last year that allows families to set aside $500 a year for college.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "AT A GLANCE: Senate's Education Savings Account Bill"
 
Following are highlights of the education savings account bill passed yesterday by the Senate:
 
MAJOR PROVISIONS
*Tax-free savings accounts would be allowed to cover expenses for elementary and secondary education, including that of children in private schools and those taught at home. Qualified expenses would include (1) tuition, tutoring, books and supplies, computers and equipment and (2) room and board, uniforms, transportation and supplementary items (including after-school care).
 *Up to $2,000 a year could be contributed by parents, other relatives, charities, foundations or employers. The bill expands on savings accounts enacted last year that allow tax-free savings of $500 a year for college only.
*Withdrawals and accumulated interest would be tax-free, but contributions would not be deductible. The savings accounts would be phased out for individuals earning more than $95,000 a year and couples making more than $150,000.
*Companies would receive a tax deduction for employee education assistance.
*Prepaid college tuition plans would be completely tax deductible.
*About $10.3 billion in education programs would be converted into block grants, under an amendment approved by the Senate, if states vote to choose block grants over Federally administered programs.
*Voluntary national tests in reading and mathematics would be prohibited, under an amendment approved by the Senate, unless specifically approved by Congress.
 
COST
The savings accounts would cost the Treasury $1.6 billion over 10 years. The total cost of the bill would be $6 billion over 10 years.
 Supporters say the bill will encourage a huge private investment in education. Opponents say that most of the tax benefits will go to the top 20 percent of all income earners and that this money should be spent on school construction, teacher hiring or other benefits to public education.

HEADLINE: MOMA to Get $65 Million From the City

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
With the city's strong economy providing an opportunity for largess, Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani pledged yesterday that the city would contribute $65 million over the next three years to help pay for a major expansion project at the Museum of Modern Art.
The money, part of the capital budget proposal the Mayor will propose today for fiscal year 1999, represents about 10 percent of the Modern's $650 million capital campaign. 
 Heralding the Modern as "one of New York City's greatest cultural resources," the Mayor announced his financial-aid plan in the musuem's sleek, sixth-floor boardroom, standing amid a series of colorful Andy Warhol prints of Marilyn Monroe.
The Modern announced in December that it had hired Yoshio Taniguchi, a Japanese architect, to design its expansion and renovation, which is scheduled to begin in 2000 and be completed in time for the museum's 75th anniversary in 2004. Besides nearly doubling the Modern's exhibition space to 650,000 square feet, the expansion will add new facilities for education, research, retail and storage.
Facing a huge price tag, trustees from the museum's expansion committee, including David Rockefeller, Donald Marron, the chairman of Paine Webber Inc., and the real estate developer Jerry Speyer approached the Giuliani administration.
Mr. Rockefeller, whose mother, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, was a founder of the Modern, said the city money was "the financial cornerstone" of the expansion. Of the remaining $585 million the museum must raise, he said that about $200 million had been pledged by "the family and trustees." Then he quickly added a qualifier: "When I say family, I mean the museum family, not my family."
Mr. Giuliani justified the city's contribution, saying that the museum expansion would provide its own economic benefits. "The reason for this investment is that the city makes its investment back in about two years," he said.
The rewards would come from the increased economic activity sparked by the Modern's expansion. Although such indirect economic benefits are notoriously difficult to predict and are open to wide interpretation, the Modern said that its expansion project would create between 1,800 and 1,900 permanent jobs at the museum and in the hotel, restaurant, retail and service industries. The figures come from a study conducted for the Modern by George Wachtel of Audience Research and Analysis.
The Modern's expansion, which would also create construction jobs, is expected to increase museum attendance to 2.5 million a year from 1.5 million now, the study said. Many are tourists who, the Modern's research shows, come to New York City expressly to visit the museum.
Mr. Rockefeller said the city would gain in other ways. "Of the benefits to the city," he said, "none will be greater than the impact on education." Indeed, with the expansion, the Modern said it would be able to serve every public school in the five boroughs with visits, gallery tours, lectures and other programs. The Modern now works with about 450 of the city's roughly 1,100 schools.
The Mayor also cited benefits to schoolchildren as justification for the $65 million grant. "Someone could say, 'Why not spend this on schools?' " he said. "For some young people, this could be even more important than school."
But City Councilman Herbert E. Berman, a Democrat from Brooklyn who is chairman of the Council's Finance Committee, criticized the Mayor for his generosity to a private institution when he was proposing a cut in the budget of city-run cultural institutions. The first draft of the Mayor's budget included an 11 percent cut for the city's Department of Cultural Affairs.
"These are very important quality-of-life services run by the City of New York," he said, "and it would seem to me that before we start giving money to non-city institutions, we should look to restore dollars to the city-operated cultural institutions, libraries and parks."
And among private institutions, Mr. Berman said he could see no reason for singling out the Museum of Modern Art. "There is a peculiarity here that has to be dealt with," he said. "All of our cultural institutions also generate enormous revenues for the City of New York, also are major tourist attractions."
But Schuyler G. Chapin, the city's Commissioner of Cultural Affairs, said yesterday that this was not a cause for concern, and suggested that the final budget for fiscal 1999 would be more generous to the arts than the draft. "Between the announcement of the Mayor's budget and June, the Department of Cultural Affairs will find itself in a pretty good condition," he predicted.
The capital grant to the Modern is just a proposal, but Mr. Guiliani said that "by June, I'm sure it will be an absolute reality."
Unlike the controversial idea of aiding a new baseball stadium with city money, which would divert tax money that has been going into the general operating budget, the Mayor's pledge to the Modern would use money from the city's capital budget. That budget, which is generally for major long-term projects, is financed through borrowing.
Mr. Chapin said the city similarly contributes to capital projects of other private cultural institutions like the Brooklyn Academy of Music, usually providing about 10 percent of the cost. For the Modern, which has received such grants in the past, $65 million is the largest amount ever.

HEADLINE: Mets Unveil Model Stadium: Its Roof Moves, as Does Grass

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
The Mets, who have quietly planned to replace Shea Stadium for several years, unveiled a model yesterday of a $500 million ball park that blends nostalgic design elements from Brooklyn's beloved Ebbets Field with modern features like a retractable roof and a removable grass playing field.
As the rain outside pelted the tarpaulin covering the Shea Stadium infield, Fred Wilpon, the Mets co-owner, stood inside the Diamond Club, a restaurant at the stadium, conducting a guided tour of the ball park model with the tiny red beam of a penlight. 
 "This is a stadium you can put your arms around," Mr. Wilpon said, "with memories of Ebbets Field."
Mr. Wilpon's announcement made clear that despite the Yankees' well-publicized quest for a new home to replace the 75-year-old Yankee Stadium, the Mets lead the city's stadium race by having a design and a site -- the parking lot next to their existing stadium.
Yesterday's unveiling came three days after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani gave details on a proposal to help pay for new stadiums for the Mets and Yankees with nearly $600 million in tax money from large Manhattan businesses.
But it was unclear how much the city would contribute to a new Mets stadium and how much of the cost the team would bear. Previously, Mets officials have indicated that they expected the city and state to shoulder three-quarters of the costs. And like the current arrangement, New York City would own the stadium.
Mr. Wilpon said only that the Mets would help pay the costs. "We've given the city an idea of where we'd like to be," he said. But he expressed optimism that the financing negotiations could be completed in the next few months.
Mr. Wilpon also said the timing of his announcement was coincidental and was not accelerated by the Mayor's action on Monday.
"When we got to the point of completing this model about a month or two ago, we felt it appropriate to do this," Mr. Wilpon said, adding that he got the Mayor's approval before showing the model. A statement from Mr. Giuliani's office described it as "a very exciting and promising plan."
Designing the stadium to evoke Ebbets Field has been Mr. Wilpon's driving passion for five years. Mr. Wilpon grew up in Brooklyn, attended Lafayette High School and occasionally pitching batting practice for the Brooklyn Dodgers.
Ebbets Field was the Dodgers' home from 1913 to 1957, until the team moved to Los Angeles. And 38 years after the stadium was felled by a wrecker's ball, memories of the stadium and its features have endured: the Romanesque arches, the rotunda enclosed in Italian marble, the quirky dimensions and the 3-foot-by-30-foot Abe Stark outfield sign that promised a free suit to batters who hit it.
The proposal, designed by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum and Jack Gordon, a local architect, echoes Mr. Wilpon's reverie: the exterior is brick and limestone combined with exposed steel trusses that are commonly used in new ball parks that seek to invoke the style of old stadiums. It has a rotunda at the entrance that looks much like the one at Ebbets. The outfield fences have peculiar nooks and crannies but do not copy Ebbets' slanted right field wall.
The right field upper deck sports pillars that allow it to be cantilevered over the field, evocative of old ball parks like Tiger Stadium. An elaborate steel bridgework design across the outfield evokes the Triborough Bridge.
A few outfield dimensions were painted on the miniature walls. Jeff Wilpon, Mr. Wilpon's 36-year-old son and partner in Sterling Equities, which Mr. Wilpon said would be the developer for the stadium, said, "Fred is still playing with them."
More practically, the new stadium includes many of the money-making features of modern stadiums, including 78 luxury suites, some no more than 20 rows from the field, and more than 5,000 high-priced club seats. The retractable roof would guarantee against rainouts.
"You think of bringing a wife and two kids from Suffolk County," Mr. Wilpon said. "If they think it's going to rain, they might not come. If they knew there was a retractable dome, they'd come."
The most unusual feature of the design is the "roll-in, roll-out" grass. The portable grass platform not only provided a way for the stadium to accommodate other events without harming the natural grass but also resolved the problem of how to grow grass under a roof that will be closed during cold, inclement weather and when the stadium is utilized for other events.
With a flick of a switch, stadium workers can move the grass platform within 15 minutes from inside the stadium to an outdoor parking lot.
The idea came from a Toronto company. "It was a little bit of 'Eureka!' " Jeff Wilpon said. "And it was simple. Fred likes simple."
Mark Bingham, the team's senior vice president for business affairs, added: "The grass is essentially in a bathtub. At certain places, you detach the irrigation system from the root system and slide the platform out." He said a stadium in Amsterdam has a similar system.
The retractable roof transforms it from a single-use stadium to a facility capable of hosting concerts, track and field meets, tennis matches and the National Collegiate Athletic Association's men's and women's basketball tournaments. Under the design, it could scaled down to 30,000 seats or expanded to 60,000.
Mr. Wilpon, who acquired the Mets with Nelson Doubleday in 1980, said he and Mr. Giuliani had also discussed the possibility of expanding the stadium to 80,000 seats if the city can lure a pro football team to Flushing. The Jets' lease in New Jersey expires in 2008.
Mr. Wilpon said he hoped the stadium would be ready by the year 2002. But before the team can proceed much further, the financial arrangements must be worked out.
Most stadiums being built in the United States have a major public investment. According to a study by David Swindell, a professor of urban affairs at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, 78.8 percent of the cost of football and baseball stadiums built between 1990 and 1998 was borne by state and city governments.
In an interview earlier this year, David Howard, the Mets' general counsel, said the team would like the city to pay a similar share of the new ball park.
Mr. Wilpon said, "We're hoping to get approval on the city saying, 'Here's the deal,' in the next few months."
Although economists have long cast doubt on the economic impact of public investment in new stadiums, Mr. Wilpon said, "The reason to do it is, empirically, the data will show it's good business."
He also said that his search for a site for a new stadium had taken him to Mitchel Field and Belmont Park, on Long Island, the Sunnyside Yards in Queens, a commercial space in Manhattan that he would not identify and the rail yards on the West Side of Manhattan that have been mentioned as a future home for the Yankees.
"We didn't seriously consider going outside New York," he said.
"It wasn't a question of a downside on the West Side, but it was timing and what you think you can get done," he said.
He said that building next to Shea Stadium "is fortunate," adding: "I'm not degrading the West Side. Under certain circumstances, we'd have liked it."

HEADLINE: Japan Can Solve Its Economic Crisis

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I wonder how Thomas L. Friedman's fondness for sushi has led him to the idea of inciting a "revolution" in Japan (column, April 7). 
 The Japanese people are engaged in a democratic debate about how to put the economy back on track to sustained growth. Mr. Friedman is right insofar as he suggests that part of this debate is over how to get out of the pattern in which "Japanese consumers won't spend and Japanese banks won't lend." However, they would be justifiably wary about the prospect of a "revolution" that could result in land prices soaring to the unsustainable levels of the late 1980's, in the traditional virtues of thrift and saving being shattered, and in the national budget being bankrupted.
It is easy for outsiders to talk about closing Japanese banks, but have they seriously thought about how closures might dent rather than restore public confidence in the future?
In truth, Japan is the second-largest absorber of imports from Asia after the United States. And it is through much-maligned Japanese savings that investments are made in the United States, supporting its economy. "Hammering" a friendly country can in fact instill a fixed mind-set, which can vitiate the effects of the policy decisions made to restore confidence.

HEADLINE: Japan Can Solve Its Economic Crisis

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your April 21 front-page article on the crisis in Japan's economy made me wonder who has really lost perspective, as we in the United States continue to ride our own "bubble economy." I fail to see how it takes "political will" to lay off workers, bankrupt companies and "snuff out the hopes of the kindly old ladies who run rice shops and futon stores." 
 Doesn't it take a stronger will to realize when enough is enough and begin the long, hard work of revitalizing an economy, and a community, around the millions of people in small and medium-sized businesses who do most of the living and working in this world?

HEADLINE: Japan Can Solve Its Economic Crisis

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Japan's refusal to accept our idea that it should have a crisis (front page, April 21) speaks well for a different measure of health than economic growth. If a society is measured by life expectancy, Japan has been on top since 1976. The United States ranked 26th in 1994. 
 How does Japan achieve such health? Not by following the usual advice given in the United States. The proportion of Japanese males who smoke is twice that in the United States, yet their death rates from smoking are far less. Japan does not need increased competition in medicine, as your article suggests. It spends less than half of what we do per capita on health care and achieves far more.
The notions of "giri-ninjo," duty and empathy, account for Japan's health. Social cohesion, not medical care, is the magic potion. It is measured by income distribution, which is more closely associated with life expectancy than any other indicator.

To the Editor:
In "Shops Closing, Japan Still Asks, 'What Crisis?' " (front page, April 21), we hear again of Japan's lack of "political will to lay off surplus workers," despite torrents of gratuitous advice from Japanese and foreign economists and the heavy-handed urging of the United States. 
 The tragedy of such interference in the sovereignty of Japan is that it may one day succeed, and wreck one of the few wholesome alternatives to our own slash-and-burn economic ideology.

Thailand Plans to Sell $1 Billion in Bonds

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Thailand plans to sell at least $1 billion of international bonds next month, Government officials said yesterday, in the nation's first sale in a year and a key test of investor confidence in the country. Thailand will probably hire investment banks to arrange the sale after Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda returns from the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in Geneva next week, officials said. Mr. Tarrin returned this week after two weeks in the United States, where he met with numerous bankers. 
 The sale will be a vital step in reopening the capital markets to the Thai Government and Thai companies after a devaluation of the country's currency last year set off Asia's financial crisis.

HEADLINE: Oilfields in Mind, White House Woos Turkmenistan's Chief

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
President Clinton and Vice President Gore met for several hours today with the authoritarian leader of a tiny Central Asian republic, hoping that a warm welcome, several nights at Blair House, a Marine honor guard and a $750,000 grant would win his cooperation in an economic struggle over control of the region's oil and gas.
The honored guest was President Saparmurat Niyazov of Turkmenistan. Less than four months ago, he stood next to President Mohammad Khatami of Iran and opened a short pipeline to send Turkmenistan's natural gas across the Iranian border. 
 Today, he stood next to Mr. Gore in the Roosevelt Room of the White House and signed an agreement under which Washington will pay for a study of another pipeline that circumvents Iran, cutting west into Turkey.
Mr. Niyazov is a former Communist Party chief who has refused incessant demands from the West and the International Monetary Fund that he privatize his centrally controlled economy. He has also suspended presidential elections.
Asked today about recently arrested political opponents, he told reporters at the White House: "We do not have any opposition parties. You are misinformed."
But for today, White House officials put aside their reservations about Mr. Niyazov's tactics, or the cult of personality he has built in his country of four million people. Instead, Vice President Gore hailed the agreement to study a new pipeline and deals Mr. Niyazov has signed recently with American oil companies, saying they contributed to "security and stability" and efforts to "diversify world energy sources."
The greeting for Mr. Niyazov is part of an immense and increasingly complicated chess game that involves American access to some of the world's largest untapped oil and gas reserves, Washington's efforts to isolate Iran and its initiatives to balance power among Russia and the former Soviet republics.
All those subjects came up during Mr. Clinton's 45-minute meeting with Mr. Niyazov, followed by a lunch for more than an hour, and a subsequent meeting with Mr. Gore. One official familiar with the sessions called the meetings "a start," describing Mr. Niyazov as "stronger on geopolitics, weaker on economics."
Indeed, he spent part of his trip here fending off suggestions from the president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, and the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, that he bring an end to the old Soviet-style command of his country's economy.
Mr. Niyazov also maintained his silence today when the subject turned to his iron control over his country. "The President and I raised our concerns about democracy, human rights and the rule of law," Mr. Gore said. A communique issued after the meeting committed Turkmenistan to "free and fair elections for parliament and the presidency" in 1999 and 2002, respectively.
Mr. Gore said the United States and Turkmenistan "need to continue to engage with each other." This puts Turkmenistan in the category of countries, including China, that the United States says stand the best chance of change if economic interaction with the rest of the world is encouraged. There is another class of countries -- including Cuba, Iran, Iraq and Myanmar -- that Washington is isolating economically, also to promote change. Most of the countries in the first category have major investment opportunities that American corporations desperately want.
This week, Washington has pressed its interests in economic engagement with Turkmenistan to new heights. It is sending the president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, James A. Harmon, to Turkmenistan next month to help finance the export of American goods.
The $750,000 grant, issued by the Trade and Development Agency, which also assists American companies pursuing business opportunities overseas, will pay for a feasibility study of alternative pipeline routes. The study must be conducted by an American company, which has not yet been selected.
Mr. Niyazov signed a parcel of small deals here. Mobil Corporation and a British partner, Monument Oil and Gas, signed an agreement forming a strategic alliance with Turkmenistan to explore and develop oil and gas in Western Turkmenistan. Separately, Mobil has asked the Clinton Administration for an exemption from the ban on transactions with Iran that would allow it to swap crude oil from Turkmenistan for crude oil from Iran.
It is unclear how the Administration will rule on that application.
Exxon signed an agreement for a "technical study as an opportunity to demonstrate Exxon's capabilities and interest" in the country.
The biggest player so far, though, is Unocal, a company that has never shied away from dealing with repressive regimes, including one with Myanmar, formerly Burma, for a pipeline project the Clinton Administration blocked last year.
Unocal has been working for several years on a pipeline project that would send Turkmen gas to Pakistan in a route that would run through Afghanistan. Unocal insists that the project is still alive, but fighting between the ruling Taliban government and opposition in the north has imperiled the project. It is unlikely that Unocal would be lent money for the pipeline if the political stability of Afghanistan remains uncertain.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 25, 1998, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Caspian Sea oil referred incorrectly to the status of a pipeline project under construction in Myanmar, formerly Burma, by Unocal and Total. Because the project began before the United States imposed a ban on investments in Myanmar last year, it is exempt from the American restrictions, and Unocal expects it to begin operations this year.

Dollar's Rise Against Yen Helps to Lift Treasuries

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended higher yesterday for the first time this week, lifted in part by the dollar's rally against the yen.
The dollar gained on disappointment over the Japanese Government's latest economic revival plan, which was announced yesterday. 
 The currency and bond markets in the United States have "grown weary of these proposals," said Vic Thompson, who oversees about $150 billion in bonds for State Street Global Advisors in Boston. "We've taken the Missouri stance: Show me it's going to work before I believe it."
Japanese investors have flocked to Treasury securities for higher returns than those available on domestic bonds and that is not likely to change, traders said yesterday. At 5.65 percent, United States 10-year notes yield 385 basis points more than the 1.80 percent yield on the 10-year Japanese Government bond. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 15/32 , to 102 1/2. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.94 percent from 5.98 percent.
Bond prices were also bolstered by short-covering as traders who had sold Treasury securities short in the belief that the Japanese plan would be strong and that Treasury prices would fall were forced to buy securities to limit their losses. In a short sale, an investor borrows a security and sells it, hoping to replace it at a lower price later, pocketing the difference. If prices rise, the investor faces a loss.
"Six percent has held" as an upper limit for bond yields, said Marcello Frustaci, a trader at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
Yesterday's gains were not enough to offset losses earlier in the week. Treasury prices have been pressured by demand for corporate bonds as General Motors, Ford Motor and Dell Computer came to market with large debt offerings. In addition, the Treasury is auctioning new two-year and five-year notes next week.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the new two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.57 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 5.62 percent.

HEADLINE: Bulldozing to Cuba

 BODY:

To the Editor:
If Fidel Castro is truly interested in obtaining Caterpillar bulldozers (Business Day, April 22), all he needs is cash and a little knowledge of the gray market. Business Week noted recently that because the Asian recession has halted construction projects in countries like Malaysia and Japan, Caterpillar equipment is available for as little as 60 percent of American dealers' wholesale prices. 
 A Cuban purchase of a few bulldozers would place no liability on Caterpillar for breaching American laws on trading with Cuba. And if parts aren't available from a Mexican or Canadian distributor, Cuban mechanics ought to be able to keep the bulldozers operating as effectively as they have thousands of 1950's Chevys.

HEADLINE: A Prometheus Yielding to Newer Lights;
Paz Defined Mexico's Soul; Now Comes a Pluralism

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 24

 BODY:
Many of Mexico's finest writers and thinkers gathered in sorrow around the coffin of the poet Octavio Paz when it lay in state on Monday, draped in a Mexican flag, in the great domed hall of the Palace of Fine Arts, the high temple of Mexican culture.
His death was not a surprise, since he was 84 and had been ill with cancer for months. Yet the intellectuals who attended the wake the day after his death seemed to be in shock as well as mourning. 
 They not only had lost a Promethean figure whose poetry, literary criticism, cultural essays and political polemics won him a Nobel Prize in 1990 and were the standard against which the rest of them were measured. They recognized that Paz's passing also marked the end of a way of cultural life in Mexico, with the reign of a few prophetic minds giving way to a pluralism of lesser voices. "The death of Paz closes a chapter in our history," said Christopher Dominguez Michael, a literary critic who was in Paz's inner circle. "It is the end of the age of the intellectual as the master of his era."
Paz's poetry spanned a vast range from surrealism to intimately personal images drawn from Mexican life. He was a tenacious advocate of democracy even when it was out of fashion.
One Mexican writer was conspicuously absent from the funeral rites. The novelist Carlos Fuentes continued on a trip that took him this week from New York to a book fair in Buenos Aires, and he remained silent about Paz's death. He refused to answer a barrage of press phone calls and suspended his normally prolific production of articles for Mexican newspapers.
For at least four decades the two men had dominated Mexico's intellectual horizon. "The Labyrinth of Solitude," Paz's lyrical but defining examination of Mexico's idiosyncrasies, was published in 1950. This year Mr. Fuentes, who is 69, celebrated the 40th anniversary of the publication of his first novel, "Where the Air is Clear," an intimate chronicle of modern Mexico City.
But 10 years ago, the two men, who were avid friends, had a furious falling out over an essay in which a Paz protege, the historian Enrique Krauze, belittled Mr. Fuentes's novels. The critique was published in The New Republic in the United States and in Vuelta (Turn), Paz's monthly literary magazine, in Mexico.
The rift polarized Mexico's literary world and saddened friends of both men. Their hopes that the two proud personalities would reconcile before Paz died were not realized. Now Mr. Fuentes has the upper floors of Mexico's cultural edifice all to himself. But both friends and critics of Mr. Fuentes said they did not expect him to assert his influence as Paz did. Mr. Fuentes is more of a loner who centers his activity squarely on writing his novels and political commentary. He has not cultivated a group of literary acolytes or opened a school of political argument as Paz did at Vuelta.
At the same time, the landscape behind Mr. Fuentes has changed. In this decade Mexico has opened its economy and started to dismantle the single-party state that had monopolized power since the 1920's. Critics of the Government, whose views could be found only in esoteric publications like Vuelta, are now prime-time television commentators and outspoken newspaper columnists.
"Since the 16th century there have been towering figures like Paz who served as the voice of the voiceless," said Jorge Castaneda, a political analyst. "Now, finally, the voiceless begin to have a voice. The country needs towering figures less and less."
Carlos Monsivais, a writer and social critic, said the changes have transformed the cultural establishment. "With Paz we had an aristocracy of thought," Mr. Monsivais said. "Now we are becoming a democracy of thought."
 
An Attack on Students Leads to Pluralism
 It was Paz himself who, in the early 1970's, introduced pluralism to the political debate. Paz, a Mexican diplomat in India, resigned from the Government in 1968 to protest its violent attack on a student demonstration in Mexico City. He returned home, but instead of leading the leftist intellectuals who spearheaded the anti-Government movement, Paz took an independent course. He founded a magazine (which evolved into Vuelta) that was equally critical of the authoritarian Government and the socialist left.
That started an often rancorous, decadeslong feud between Paz and Mexicans who sided with socialism, a feud that subsided only after the cold war ended.
"He broke the unity of the Mexican republic of letters," recalled Mr. Krauze, who was the publisher of Vuelta for two decades and remains on its board. "A cultural monopoly is no longer possible."
 
The Prestige of Paz Amounted to Control
 Yet some Mexican intellectuals who are grieving for Paz the poet and philosopher said they would not miss the control he exercised over Mexico's cultural institutions by virtue of his prestige. Homero Aridjis, a poet and novelist, said Paz sometimes determined by whim which artists would win prizes, publish books and receive scholarships and sidelined those who didn't suit his taste.
Mr. Aridjis also criticized Paz for his rapprochement with the Mexican Government, which began in the 1980's. "After 1968, Paz wrote an essay criticizing what he called the pyramid of power in Mexico, the first serious critique of the political system," he said. "But in the last years of his life he became part of the pyramid of power. It was his great contradiction."
An immediate question is what will happen to Vuelta, now in its 22d year. Its circulation of about 10,000 has been shrinking even though it is probably the pre-eminent literary magazine in Latin America. Mr. Krauze said he had thought it was "poor taste" to discuss the magazine's future with Paz when he was still alive. He and several others among the poet's followers said they now thought it was time for a new "turn," although they were not sure what it might be.
"Vuelta has won many of its battles," Mr. Dominguez, the critic, said. "The Berlin wall fell and the democracy Octavio sought is a reality we live every day in Mexico. But we still have the task of criticizing the open society and protecting it from self-destructive impulses."
Indeed, Paz's death highlighted the shift of intellectual debate away from small reviews and salonlike groups. Through Vuelta, Paz engaged in a running duel with an archrival left-leaning magazine called Nexos, which is most closely identified with one of its founders, the novelist Hector Aguilar Camin. At one point in 1992 a controversy over what kind of support intellectuals should take from the Government brought the two magazines into a verbal war so fiery that it became front page news.
But political differences between the two camps narrowed after the collapse of Communism, and editors on both sides acknowledged -- but did not lament -- that their disputes had become increasingly rarefied.
"The central factor is that Mexico now has a more educated, independent, critical mass media," Mr. Aguilar Camin said. "For the first time we have the possibility of well-informed public opinion." Both magazines paid a price with their readers for the support they gave separately to Carlos Salinas de Gortari when he was President. Both men praised changes begun by Mr. Salinas to modernize Mexico. But Mr. Salinas fell into disgrace shortly after leaving office and was forced into exile in 1995, leaving behind a public convinced that he had enriched himself through corruption.
With the exception of Mr. Fuentes, no living Mexican intellectual approaches the stature Paz enjoyed. Rising novelists like Sergio Pitol and Angeles Mastretta have not sought to sway the course of events in Mexico as Paz did.
But the new generation of Mexican thinkers is considerably more diverse than earlier ones. On Sunday, a weekly series of 104 hourlong television documentaries produced by Mr. Krauze, 55, one of Paz's most direct intellectual heirs, will begin on Televisa, the largest national network. The series will give Mexicans an uncensored panorama of their country in the 20th century unlike anything ever displayed on Mexican television.
 
Away From Analysis, Closer to the Public
 Mr. Aridjis, 58, the poet, is also a prominent environmental activist and president of PEN International. Mr. Castaneda, who is 44, besides being a tireless anti-Government gadfly, published a scholarly biography of the Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara last year.
"You will no longer see those lyrical and insightful but unscientific analyses of the Mexican soul" like those that distinguished Paz and Mr. Fuentes, Mr. Castaneda said. "You no longer have figures of their dimension, and not too many people care what others say about the soul of the country. That includes me; what do I know about the soul of the country?"
Yet there are signs that the new Mexican intellectuals are drawing closer to the public than Paz ever did with his dense and cerebral verse. Mr. Monsivais, who is 60 and cuts the frumpy figure of a Mexican Woody Allen, arranged to meet an interviewer at a coffee shop not unlike a Howard Johnson's. At one point the waitress, dressed in a starched pink uniform, interrupted the interview by peering at Mr. Monsivais.
"Aren't you a writer?" she said with delight. When Mr. Monsivais identified himself, she pumped his hand energetically.
"Do you think you might write about Octavio Paz?" she wondered. "I guess he was a pretty good writer, too."

HEADLINE: A $50 Billion Surplus? Doubtful, Report Says

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
Projecting ever bigger Federal budget surpluses has become almost a parlor game here, with politicians and economists pushing the number in the last few weeks to more than $50 billion for this year, a stunning windfall for a nation that long had a reputation for spending away its future.
Today the Congressional Budget Office put a damper on the fun. After studying the tax receipts flowing into the Government's coffers in the days following April 15, the budget office found that while there would be a significant surplus this year, it was unlikely to be as big as the $50 billion that the conventional wisdom has come to assume. 
 Instead, the budget office is standing by its prediction of a surplus from $8 billion to $18 billion, which in itself would make this the first year the Government has been in the black since 1969. The deficit last year was $22 billion.
The budget office, on whose judgment Congress relies to set tax and spending policy, has repeatedly proved too pessimistic in its analyses over the last few years. And even if it is proved right this time, there will be few serious policy ramifications from the lower surplus: the trend toward considerably larger surpluses in coming years remains, portending a pool of money that could go toward shoring up Social Security or addressing a host of other priorities advanced by both parties, from cutting taxes to improving education.
Still, the budget office's analysis today offered a telling counterpoint to a new post-deficit psychology that seems to have taken hold in Washington, where pleasant surprises are assumed by many to lurk around every corner and where the possibility of economic downturns or fiscal crises is all but ignored.
Earlier this month the budget office said the surplus would be $18 billion if the economy's performance for the next six months matched that for same period last year. White House officials have said they expect the surplus to be larger than $18 billion, but have not specified a number and have been dubious about projections in the $50 billion range.
A senior Clinton Administration official said today that the Treasury Department itself did not have a good handle on the size of the April tax receipts and could not yet offer any new estimates.
Many private economists and politicians have been less guarded. Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said on Sunday that he expected a surplus of $45 billion to $55 billion this year. Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Monday that he expected the number to be $50 billion.
Economists at investment firms that analyze the Treasury Department's daily and monthly accounting statements have been predicting a $50 billion surplus for months, with some saying privately that the number could be even higher.
The budget office did not release any formal analysis today, and told Congressional staff members only that it was not prepared to issue a revised surplus estimate. Aides to Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Domenici did not return phone calls about their earlier predictions, and with Congress not in session today there was little reaction to the budget office's findings.
But June O'Neill, the director of the budget office, elaborated on her position in an interview. She said she was reluctant to come to any final conclusions about the surplus at this point, especially since she badly underestimated revenues last year. But she said that tax receipts recorded so far in April -- especially the type of tax receipt that includes payment of capital gains taxes from profits in the booming stock market -- provided little evidence to support hopes of a $50 billion surplus.
"Having experienced last year where we understated revenue by $70 billion, I would hesitate to rule anything out," Ms. O'Neill said. "But it's in the unlikely category that we would have a $50 billion surplus."
In particular, she said, there is little evidence so far of an "April surprise" of the magnitude that the nation enjoyed last year, when so-called non-withheld payments -- taxes that are not withheld from regular paychecks -- came in $25 billion higher than expected for the month, presumably because of a surge in capital gains from the stock market.
"The non-withheld payments as best we can tell are not much higher if higher at all from last year and are more or less in line with what we've been projecting," she said.
Ms. O'Neill said the budget office would continue to monitor tax receipts in coming days and would issue an informal update early next month.
She said the good news was that revenue from wage and salary income this year had been stronger than expected, a trend that if continued could help push the surplus higher. But most economists are predicting that the economy will cool this year, and the number of jobs in the economy actually declined in March, the first time that has happened in any month in more than two years.
"The big question for the year," Ms. O'Neill said, "is what is going to happen to wage and salary income."

Japan Offers New Package For Economy

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 24

 BODY:
Digging deeper into its purse, the Government announced a record $128 billion program of spending and economic stimulants today aimed at pulling the economy out of a seven-year slump and easing apprehension that Japanese weakness will cause a global slowdown.
In raising spending more than $15 billion beyond amounts in a blueprint of the package released a few weeks ago, the Government seemed to be trying to demonstrate its resolve to the world. American officials have been badgering Japan to revive its economy through large and long-term tax cuts that would prompt consumers to spend more, but the package contained no permanent or major tax reductions. 
 Officials from the United States and elsewhere around the world have been watching the slumbering Japanese economy with increasing alarm. Japan's $600 billion in bad and doubtful debt has dragged down economic growth since 1991 and the Japanese appetite for imports has diminished, posing a threat to other economically troubled countries in Asia.
Today, Clinton Administration officials expressed modest enthusiasm about the package but emphasized, as other economists did, that now deregulation is necessary to achieve sustainable growth.
The amount of spending will be $92 billion, about the size of the economy of Poland, and almost all of it will be rushed into the economy within 12 months. Indeed, the spending portion of the package has been creeping up as criticism from around the world kept pouring in and investors kept battering the markets here.
Now, the Government says the package could add 2 percent to growth, though private economists are less optimistic.
"This is the largest package we will have ever implemented," said Eisuke Sakakibara, Vice Finance Minister for international affairs. "I haven't heard of any package like this in the rest of the world. I'd argue -- for any criticism that this is too small -- that this may be too big."
In an embarrassing about-face, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto also began the process of amending the nation's controversial austerity law so as to lay the groundwork for the tax cuts, worth about $35 billion.
Just five months ago, Mr. Hashimoto had championed a plan to cut the budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product by the year 2004 to help Japan prepare for its aging population.
Now that target year will be delayed to 2006, and the Government tried to present its program today as a strategy for ushering Japan into the 21st century on a solid economic footing. But the transition is unlikely to be smooth. Many economists estimate that Japan's economy shrunk for the first time in a quarter-century during the fiscal year that ended March 31.
Other statistics paint a bleak picture: company profits, industrial production and consumer and business sentiment are falling, while unemployment, bankruptcies and stockpiles of unsold products are rising.
Though the package has been padded again, some economists still worry the spending will be misused on large public-works projects that do little to stimulate the economy once they are completed.
"The package itself is a huge mistake," said Brian H. Rose, senior economist at SBC Warburg Japan Ltd. "They are spending 9 percent of G.D.P. on public works in a country that has no population growth, that doesn't need any more schools or libraries or bridges or roads. Now, they don't need to pave the bottom of the river beds."
The Government defended itself by saying most of the spending on public works would go into projects for the environment and new energy, information and science technology, and social welfare and education.
The Government said it would also give nearly $5 billion in tax incentives to stimulate corporate investment and the purchase of homes.
Tax cuts, however, are less effective than public works spending in causing immediate growth, particularly in this case because everyone knows the cuts are only temporary and the Government expects households will save most of the money. For the current fiscal year, each taxpayer is expected to receive a rebate of about $223 beginning in August, and a typical household of four would enjoy a tax cut of a total of $558 in the current fiscal year.
Still, altogether, Japan's Economic Planning Agency says the package will add 2 percent to growth for the year ending next March 31.
In contrast, Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Japan, predicts the economy will contract by four-tenths of a percent in the current fiscal year, but he says the package is still comforting.
"It puts a floor under the economy," Mr. Feldman said. "The risk of a real deflationary spiral is largely removed by the package."
But for many critics, the economic problems go way beyond what can be solved with spending. The key, they argue, is that Japan must undertake broad restructuring and deregulation.
"It's just a one-off shot in the arm," said Peter Morgan, senior economist at HSBC Securities (Japan) Ltd., of today's package.
Some economists say the Government must rework its tax system, where the highest individual income tax rates are effectively 65 percent -- down from 88 percent a decade ago. Corporate tax rates have dropped from 49.98 percent last year to 46.36 percent this year, but they are still higher than rates in America and Europe.
Though the Government plans to bring down the corporate tax rate to international standards within three years, some economists want it done more quickly. Moreover, many economists are calling for flattening out Japan's highly progressive tax system and for a comprehensive overhaul of the tax system.
In another crucial area of the economy, the Government also said it would offer subsidies to allow for "employment adjustment," a sensitive measure that would encourage workers to switch jobs. Japan's lifetime employment system is fraying at the edges, but layoffs are virtually illegal, unless a company is going bankrupt. The Government would have to revise its labor regulations to create a more mobile labor force and today's plan made little mention of that.
Still, the package offered a number of measures viewed as encouraging. It would ease the criteria for extending Government housing loans to encourage more home ownership, offer debt guarantees for new ventures, expand financing for small and medium businesses and extend $5.4 billion in loans and support programs in Asia.
The Government also said it would invest about $30 billion of postal savings funds in the stock market, though it did not count these funds as part of the overall package.
Mr. Sakakibara said banks were planning to write off more than 60 percent of their bad debt in the fiscal year ended on March 31, but unless the property market recovered, the bad debt could grow.
Consequently, the Government said it would try to revive the property market by spending $18 billion to buy land and help banks dispose of bad loans. More important, the Government said it was considering using public funds to create a market in asset-backed securities, similar to what was done in the United States in the early 1990's to help alleviate its savings and loan crisis.
"I personally don't like to emulate the United States all the time," Mr. Sakakibara said, "but this is the time to emulate the United States."

HEADLINE: Compliments of U.S. Investors;
New Activism Shakes Europe's Markets

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
When a French utilities conglomerate, Compagnie Generale des Eaux, proposed taking over the country's largest media group, it did not reckon with Colette Neuville. Mrs. Neuville, a soft-spoken woman in her 60's, filed a suit contending that shareholders in the target company were getting a raw deal.
Though she lost the court fight, she chalked up a major victory last month. 
 The founder of France's biggest minority shareholder group, she was invited to dine with Generale's chairman a week before the formal takeover offer was announced. The company then sweetened its bid, for Havas S.A., with a cash premium of $817 million, equal to $10 a share, or 14.5 percent more than the original offer.
"A corporation is in business for its shareholders," Mrs. Neuville said, displaying her combativeness over breakfast recently. "It's not a cooperative; it's not a kibbutz."
Let there be no doubt about it, the American brand of shareholder activism is spreading abroad. European companies are under pressure from small investors, like Mrs. Neuville, and from foreign investors. Taking such interests into consideration is more important as these companies find themselves in a global competition for capital. Activist American groups like the Lens Fund and the California Public Employee Retirement System are planting seed money in aggressive European funds; other investors, like Fidelity Investments and Templeton, are increasingly putting pressure on European managers and standing up for their rights.
In Europe, investors with only a minority stake have special obstacles. Governments are often majority shareholders, big companies own stakes in each other to protect managers from outside challenges, and universal banks may have conflicts of interest since they serve as lenders, shareholders and pension funds.
But if the new activism takes hold, it could add value by driving European corporations to overhaul their capital structures, shed unprofitable lines of business and put independent directors on corporate boards. It will certainly solidify the rights of junior investors, who often get pushed around in ways that American stock owners can only imagine.
In Germany, minority shareholders are struggling with a number of companies, including Borg-Warner and the Tech Data Corporation of Clearwater, Fla., which are absorbing other companies in which they own majority shares. Minority investor groups, objecting that they are not receiving full value for their shares, say their rights are being trodden.
In Italy, junior investors are suing over the recent Government bailout of Banco di Napoli, the money-losing bank in Southern Italy, and over a bankruptcy case involving a Genoa construction company. In each case, the investments of minority shareholders were wiped out.
In Switzerland, the maverick investor Martin Ebner harasses corporations and banks to provide greater shareholder value. Several pension funds, including the Geneva public employees fund, recently formed a group called the Ethos Fund to stimulate long-term investor value.
But some of the most bitter battles have been fought in France, where protectionism, government traditions and corporate cronyism pose a particularly tangled web.
Take Generale, which has been trying to transform itself from a cumbersome utility to a nimble telecommunications company with television and telephone businesses. In the late 1980's, Jean-Marie Messier was a civil servant who helped write legislation to privatize Havas, a publishing group with a holding in Europe's biggest cable network, Canal Plus. Later, as chairman of Generale, Mr. Messier accumulated a third of Havas, and last year he proposed taking it over and making it the linchpin of Generale's telecommunications ambitions. Because Generale effectively had management control, few obstacles seemed to be in the way.
Generale's approach was typical of French companies. Minority investors were asked to accept Generale's valuation of Havas shares, rather than submit them to auction. Mrs. Neuville's lawsuit argued that French rules required Generale to seek outside bids, given that it had effective control of Havas management. Though the court ruled in favor of Generale, Mr. Messier wanted to avoid further negative publicity, hence the $10 cash premium for each Havas share.
In the end, the executive and the shareholder watchdog parted amicably. Mrs. Neuville said she even went out and bought Generale shares. "I told him he convinced me of his project," she said.
Practices such as bullying minority investors into accepting evaluations undertaken by the majority shareholders were once common in the United States, said Nell Minow, a principal of the Lens Fund in Washington. They were used frequently in the 1980's wave of mergers and acquisitions but are much less common now in the United States because of legislative reform and shareholder resistance.
In March, Lens announced it was joining one of Britain's largest asset managers, Hermes Pensions Management, to form a fund that will put pressure on British corporations to clean up their acts. Earlier, Calpers said it would invest $200 million in Active Value Capital L.P., another activist fund in Britain. Taking a cue from such examples, the pension funds of large German banks, like Deutsche Bank and DG Bank, have begun speaking out at shareholder meetings, said Reinhild Keitel, spokeswoman for the Association to Protect Minority Shareholders in Frankfurt.
"The drive is coming from the United States and taking up steam in Britain," said Corinna Arnold, director of global shareholder services at the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington, which promotes shareholder self-help. Now, she said, the spark is set to jump the English Channel.
The French Government, pressed for cash to meet the fiscal requirements of Europe's planned single currency, has for years been gradually selling off shares in banks, insurance companies and industrial groups. Now, one-third and more of the equity of large industrial groups like France's largest oil company, Elf Aquitaine, and Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals giant, are owned by foreign investment funds. But to maintain control, the Government created what it called noyaux dures, or hard cores, blocks of shares that state-owned banks, insurance companies and other industrial enterprises hold in each other. This intertwined ownership is gradually breaking up, but the Government still resorts to it when, for example, large numbers of jobs are at stake. At times, even national security can be the issue.
Take the case of Eramet S.A., a mining company in which the French Treasury holds a stake after a partial privatization in 1994. Last summer, minority shareholders led by a group of British and American investment funds successfully ended a yearlong struggle with the French Government, which sought to swap a nickel mine that Eramet owned in New Caledonia, a French territory in the South Pacific, for a less profitable one controlled by local separatists, to appease the independence movement.
When the Eramet chairman, Yves Rambaud, resisted, the Government threatened to pack the Eramet board and dismiss him. Only after big foreign funds, including Fidelity Investments and the College Retirement Equity Fund, warned the Government that its proposal would have long-lasting negative effects on foreign investment in France did the new Socialist-led Government that took office early last year reverse the decision.
"It takes a little bit of inventiveness, and you must understand the differences" between American and French corporate law, said Sophie L'Helias, a French lawyer who represented the funds.
In France, 60 percent of French institutional investors questioned in a recent survey by the executive search firm, Russell Reynolds Associates, said they favor standardized corporate governance rules like those proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In Germany, new laws require universal banks acting as brokers to inform shareholders that someone else can represent them.
In Italy, the Government approved new rules this month for mergers and acquisitions, disclosure and insider trading that bear the name of their author, Mario Draghi, the Deputy Treasury Minister. Adamo Gentile, a broker who heads Assorisparmio, dismissed them as a "elegant way to confirm the status quo." But the Treasury Minister, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, called them a "decisive step forward" toward a "more competitive and more open" financial system.
Some experts say the threat of criminal sanctions is adding to the pressure from foreign funds for change.
Dominique Schmidt, professor of law at Strasbourg University who advises Mrs. Neuville, said that "until the start of the 1990's criminal lawsuits were seldom." But in 1996, he said, French investigators arrested the former head of Elf Aquitaine, Loik Le Floch-Prigent, on suspicion of fraud and receiving stolen assets, and a Paris judge is investigating possible criminal behavior at several companies, including the state-owned bank, Credit Lyonnais.
Mrs. L'Helias, who set up a company in 1994, Franklin Global Investor Services, to mediate between investment funds and corporations, relies more on the persuasive power of big foreign funds, though she acknowledges that court action can occasionally help. "Even if you lose," she said, "it sends a strong signal to the market that people are not happy."
But she notes that the absence in Europe of a dense regulatory network like that of the Securities Exchange Commission in the United States leaves room for inventiveness by concerned shareholders. In 1996, for example, she organized minority investors in the indebted Channel Tunnel project by publishing proxy solicitations in a French newspaper and attracted 25,000 responses, even though colleagues said the action was illegal. "Show me the rule forbidding it," was her reply.
Mrs. Neuville agrees. "New laws cannot change things; the shareholders have to do it themselves," she said. "They are a minority in power, not in numbers."

HEADLINE: U.S.-Russia Impasse Is Said to Delay a U.N. Debate on Iraqi Arms Inspections

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 24

 BODY:
A standoff between the United States and Russia has apparently derailed plans for a Security Council debate early next week about changing the level of nuclear inspections in Iraq, diplomats said today.
The Security Council meets on Monday to review sanctions on Iraq, imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, following renewed Iraqi demands that the embargo be ended and weapons inspections restricted. The sanctions are expected to be renewed for another six months. 
 In what looked like a small gesture to Iraq and its supporters on the Council, it seemed likely early today that the Council was moving toward allowing the International Atomic Energy Agency to shift the level of its surveillance from searching for and destroying prohibited material to long-term monitoring. Last week the survey team reported that it had found no evidence of prohibited nuclear activity in Iraq.
But in the highly charged atmosphere surrounding the sanctions review -- coming on the heels of a protracted arms-inspection crisis that nearly brought the United States into war against Iraq -- there was no agreement today on how and when to make the move. Russia had planned to introduce a formal resolution "closing the file" on the Iraqi nuclear program. The United States and Britain opposed that plan.
Moreover, Bill Richardson, the United States representative, said in an interview today that he had qualms about changing the status of nuclear inspections, in large part because of a much less positive report on Iraq's biological, chemical and missile programs by Richard Butler, whose Special Commission covers those areas.
"We have serious concerns about closing the nuclear file, given Butler's testimony that there's been little progress on the other disarmament fronts," Mr. Richardson said in an interview today. He said that Iraq was still concealing crucial information.
Britain, the strongest ally of the United States on the issue, seems prepared to follow the lead of the atomic energy agency, its representative, Sir John Weston, said in an interview.
"If the I.A.E.A. are saying that the best way for them to conduct their work at this point is to transition from a disarmament phase to on-site monitoring and verification," he said, "the United Kingdom would certainly listen to arguments on that score."
But he agreed with other Council members that a formal resolution was not necessary, and that a simple Council statement would be adequate to mark the change.
An end to the disarmament phase of nuclear accounting in Iraq would still leave the atomic energy agency with considerable powers to inspect any suspect Iraqi sites.
The concern of some diplomats and scientists in the arms-control movement is that Iraq will seize the moment to increase pressure to reduce the level of inspections in other areas, and that President Saddam Hussein will find ways to limit or block inspections.
David Albright, president of the independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington and a former atomic agency monitor in Iraq, said that Iraq is likely to insist that future inspections be no more stringent than the agency's ordinary checks on any country that has signed the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons. Iraq signed the pact -- and then proceeded to try to make nuclear weapons anyway.
"There is a slippery slope here," Mr. Albright said today of the move to change the disarmament status of Iraq. "How steep it is is hard to measure now. But Iraq may soon try to push inspections down to the level of routine I.A.E.A. safeguards. Even with improvements, I.A.E.A. safeguards are not sufficient in the case of Iraq, given its intentions and its history."
Some diplomats say that it is necessary to weigh fears of future action against the need to start giving the Iraqis some encouragement and sense of accomplishment if Baghdad is to be prodded into greater cooperation in problem areas.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Blue Chips Retreat 78.71 On Concern About Growth

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market finished the week on a down note yesterday, falling sharply just days after hitting new highs across the board.
First-quarter earnings reports have been coming in a little better than expected, but the growth rate compared with that of a year ago is still slow. A number of companies, including Kellogg yesterday, have warned that the near-term outlook is not all that positive. 
 This environment has made investors jittery, especially because the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have moved up nearly 15 percent this year even though earnings growth for the first quarter may not break 3 percent.
"It is a market taking a pause, digesting recent earnings news and waiting for more data points on Asia," said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
What is not clear is whether the jitters, which so far have made the market volatile on a steady trip higher, could turn into a broader uncertainty about the outlook that would put the stock market on hold for a while. Such a pause could last until investors are sure that earnings will pick up in the second half of the year and that the drag from the Asian economic turmoil is passed.
The Dow was down 123 points in the afternoon but partly recovered to close with a loss of 78.71, at 9,064.62. The S.& P. 500 fell 11.68, to 1,107.90, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq dropped 12.43, to 1,868.96.
Stocks were led lower by Microsoft and Intel in technology, J. P. Morgan and American Express in banking, Merck in pharmaceuticals and Sears, Roebuck in retailing.
Christina Heuer, the drug analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said Merck was undermined by the reminder that it would soon have to share the profits of Cozaar, with DuPont, which invented the popular heart drug but let Merck commercialize it. "Merck does not comment on this much," she said.
The reminder, she said, came from DuPont in discussions with analysts after it reported earnings on Wednesday. In an answer to a question, an executive said the profit-sharing agreement could take effect in the fourth quarter of 1999. "We knew there was a profit-sharing agreement but not when it would go into effect," Ms. Heuer said.
This news, she said, also reminded investors of the large number of Merck drugs that lose their patents in 2000 and 2001 and came just after Merck fell short of first-quarter earnings estimates while some rivals were beating theirs. The stock fell 3 7/8, or 3.2 percent, to 116 1/2.
For Sears and American Express, the declines came after they both beat earnings expectations in reports released on Thursday. Sears's loss was less than expected, while American Express's profits rose more than forecast.
Some analysts suggested that Sears was not resolving its credit card delinquency problems fast enough. Sears fell 1 13/16, to 57 9/16.
American Express was harder to explain. Susan L. Roth, financial services analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said she thought the stock just declined with the overall market, which was led lower by financial stocks.
Banking and other financial stocks have been volatile recently because of speculation about takeovers after the announcement of major banking mergers, including the proposed wedding of Travelers and Citicorp. "The stock is a tough one to interpret because there is so much talk over takeovers," she said. American Express finished off 1 3/16, at 101 7/8.
Kellogg, which fell 1 1/4, to 39 3/4, met forecasts with its earnings of 42 cents a diluted share. But it also said that price cutting in the cereal business would hurt second-quarter earnings.
Walt Disney gave up almost all the gains it made on Thursday, after it posted better-than-expected earnings and a 3-for-1 split late on Wednesday. Yesterday, it dropped 1 9/16, to 122 1/8.

Stocks End Week Lower, Hurt by Earnings Doubts
Anxiety over the health of corporate earnings later this year dragged the stock market down yesterday just days after it hit new highs across the board. Stocks were led lower by Microsoft and Intel in technology, J. P. Morgan and American Express in banking, Merck in pharmaceuticals and Sears in retailing. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,064.62, down 78.71 points for the day and 102.88 points, or 1.1 percent, for the week. D4.
 
Treasury prices rose for the first time this week, lifted partly by the dollar's strength against the yen. The 30-year Treasury yield fell to 5.94 percent from 5.98. D4.
 
Short interest in Nasdaq stocks rose 3.3 percent, to a record 1.99 billion in the month through April 9, reflecting a bet that stocks would fall. But short interest in many large technology stocks declined. D4.
 
Large Loss at Hitachi
Hitachi, Japan's largest maker of electronics, will report a $905 million loss for the fiscal year that ended March 31 to reflect the costs of restructuring its chip business and increasing its pension fund. D3.
 
Nomura, Daiwa and Nikko, Japan's three biggest investment houses, reported bleak earnings results for the latest year because of a racketeer payoff scandal and the prolonged slump in the Japanese stock market. D3.
 
Russia's Economic Course Affirmed
Russian legislative opposition to President Boris N. Yeltsin's choice for Prime Minister collapsed, ending a fractious political brawl and keeping the country on course toward building a free-market economy. A1.
 
Slower Growth in China
China's economic growth slowed to 7.2 percent in the first quarter from 8.8 percent in 1997, for which the Government partly blamed the effects of economic problems elsewhere in Asia. But it said growth would likely increase to an 8 percent rate this year, which Chinese leaders believe is the minimum needed to keep unemployment low. D3.
 
Earnings Gain at U S West
U S West Communications reported a 2.4 percent gain in quarterly earnings to $347 million, or 61 cents a share, on strong sales of Internet services and demand for more phone lines. The results exceeded estimates of 69 cents a share, but the company's stock still ended slightly lower. D2.
 
Regulators Approve Market Merger
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the merger of the New York Cotton Exchange and the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. The combination forms the second-largest United States agricultural exchange behind the Chicago Board of Trade. D2.
 
Extending Viagra Boon to Women
About 100 scientists from drug companies, academia and the Food and Drug Administration met to discuss how to apply the success of Pfizer's Viagra male impotence drug to women. As every drug company scientist at the meeting realized, if a drug like Viagra is effective in women as well as in men, the market could be doubled. A9.
 
Waste Hauler Expands
Allied Waste Industries said it would acquire the Rabanco Companies, one of the largest waste haulers in the country. Terms weren't disclosed, but the acquisition significantly expands the reach of Allied Waste, which provides collection, disposal and transportation services in 18 states. Its shares rose more than 11 percent, to $26.1875. D2.
 
Financial Sanctions on Yugoslavia
Clinton Administration officials said the United States would seek a freeze on hundreds of millions of dollars in Yugoslav assets held overseas and a stiffer ban on trade with the Belgrade Government as a punishment for ethnic fighting in Yugoslavia that threatens to spill into Albania. A4.

HEADLINE: Layoffs Rupture Tie Between Giuliani and Labor Leader

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
To many New Yorkers, Stanley Hill, head of the giant union representing 120,000 city workers, had long been something of an enigma: He has the power to make mayors quake, yet he had been remarkably docile toward Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and conspicuously silent about the city's much-criticized workfare program.
Until now. 
 All of a sudden, the giant -- some would say, the pussycat -- has stirred. All of a sudden, Mr. Hill, executive director of District Council 37, denounced Mr. Giuliani's workfare program as slavery and went to court to have it declared illegal.
Mr. Hill's abrupt about-face stemmed largely from the Giuliani administration's layoff of 905 public-hospital workers. (The pink slips went out Monday.) And on Thursday, after several days of rising union protests, it led a Mayor not known for backing down to do a pirouette of his own and remove all workfare workers from the public hospitals.
Beyond the somewhat surreal notion of the city effectively laying off people ordered to work for their welfare checks, though, the week's events upset a close relationship between two of the city's most powerful men, a relationship that has made Mr. Giuliani's years in power far less rocky than they might otherwise have been. The rupture in their relationship could make life difficult for the Mayor -- it could mean more lawsuits, poisonous labor negotiations, thousands of grievances filed against the city and Mr. Hill's union campaigning against Mr. Giuliani if he seeks higher office.
To several labor experts, the Mayor's action appeared to be both an olive branch to Mr. Hill and an effort to defuse the union's lawsuit, which charges the city with illegally displacing city workers with workfare participants. On Thursday, the administration denied that withdrawing the workfare workers proved the city had been using them to replace regular workers.
Despite that seeming peace offer, Mr. Hill said that move would not end the feud, insisting, as he had all week, that he would patch things up with the Mayor only if the 905 layoffs were rescinded.
"This is not a bump in the road -- this is a real serious problem," Mr. Hill said. "You're talking about people's livelihoods, people who are going to be laid off. Probably a majority will, after exhausting unemployment insurance, have to apply for public assistance."
In an interview the other day, Mr. Hill offered three reasons for his new combativeness toward Mr. Giuliani and workfare: the Mayor, he said, has gone back on several promises; has failed to fix the flaws Mr. Hill sees in workfare, and has hurt union members with the hospital layoffs, the first suffered by his union under Mr. Giuliani.
The layoffs, the union leader said, were nothing less than a double-cross, given that his union had endorsed Mr. Giuliani in last November's mayoral election and made $600 million in concessions to help balance the city's budget.
"We helped bail out this Mayor when he had a fiscal problem, to the tune of $600 million," Mr. Hill said. "He has not fulfilled his part of the bargain by helping us when we're in need."
The help he gave the Mayor -- in those contract negotiations and in his silence as workfare participants did work once done by union members -- had brought Mr. Hill considerable heat from other union leaders and from his rank and file. The hospital workers were an especially sensitive case: Two years ago, many of them fumed when he left them vulnerable to layoffs by signing a contract that lacked the no-layoff clause provided to other District Council members.
Now, those who even a week ago saw him as cozying up to the Mayor are giving him considerable applause. And that, in turn, has left City Hall suggesting that Mr. Hill attacked workfare not out of principle but to protect his political flanks.
"When we negotiated the municipal labor agreements and all our agreements, Stan has said it over and over again, one thing we always do is keep our word," said Randy Levine, Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development. "Now he's changing his tune because he's in a difficult internal situation."
To Daniel Walkowitz, a labor historian at New York University, Mr. Hill is "trying to save face."
"He's never shown a profound understanding of workfare in the past, and he's never shown a willingness to break with the Mayor," Mr. Walkowitz added. "What he has shown is his sense that the union's interest is best tied to the Mayor. This is the first time that balance has seemed to shift."
Still, anyone who knows Mr. Hill well knows he is a proud man who takes the notion of trust very seriously. After tens of thousands of city workers were laid off in decades past, Mr. Hill was proud that no District Council 37 members had been laid off under Mr. Giuliani.
Now, he says he is angry that Mr. Giuliani breached a relationship of trust -- a trust that Mr. Giuliani's administration worked assiduously to develop beginning in its first year. According to city and union officials, Mr. Giuliani told Mr. Hill his door was always open, while Mr. Levine, the Mayor's first Labor Commissioner, spent scores of hours with Mr. Hill and other union officials to cement their ties. In addition, the Mayor's staff took pains not to renege on its word in any negotiations.
Mr. Giuliani's aides were mindful of Mr. Hill's rupture with former Mayor David N. Dinkins. Mr. Hill, whose union played a major role in electing Mr. Dinkins in 1989, felt betrayed when Mr. Dinkins laid off hundreds of park workers.
During the interview this week, Mr. Hill did little to hide his anger, repeatedly accusing the Mayor of lacking good faith and breaking various laws and agreements.
The Mayor, he asserted, is violating a state law that bars communities from using workfare participants to displace city workers. The Mayor, he said, is violating a promise to provide the 34,000 workfare workers with training that leads to permanent jobs. The Mayor, he argued, violated a promise to exhaust all alternatives before public hospital workers were laid off. "I don't want to get personal with the Mayor, but I don't think the Mayor has followed through in good faith the way he has in the past," Mr. Hill said.
Norman Adler, a Democratic political consultant, explained Mr. Hill's concern this way: "My own sense from conversations with Stanley is he thought they'd go through the year 2001 without seeing layoffs, especially in light of the city's good financial situation."
Mr. Hill said that with the city enjoying a nearly $2 billion surplus, the layoff decision was political, not economic. "He's got a national agenda," Mr. Hill said. "He's showing people he can be tough."
Mr. Levine called that nonsense, asserting that the layoffs had been carried out not by the Mayor but by the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs the public hospitals. "There hasn't been one city worker who's been laid off," he said. "There have been layoffs in H.H.C., but everyone understood there might have to be because its hospitals were overstaffed and underutilized."
Mr. Levine insisted that as an alternative to layoffs, the city had proposed buying out the hospital workers or redeploying them to other departments -- proposals he said Mr. Hill rejected. Mr. Hill said the city had made no such proposals.
Mr. Levine also denied that workfare was displacing city workers.
Earlier this month, in a series of articles on workfare, The New York Times reported that many workfare participants -- in the hospitals and in other agencies -- were doing work once done by civil servants. In an interview for that series, Mr. Hill had also denied that workfare participants were displacing city workers.
But this week, he acknowledged that he had already concluded back then that such displacement was going on. He said he had long shied away from publicly criticizing workfare because he was negotiating behind the scenes with City Hall to improve the program. The lack of progress in those talks, he said, coupled with the hospital layoffs, caused him to turn against workfare.
"I have no choice but to come in hard," he said, "because the Mayor has violated the law and violated something else we've had for years: good faith and good communication."

HEADLINE: Iran Nearly Got A Missile Alloy From Russians

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON with ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 24

 BODY:
A truck laden with 22 tons of stainless steel that could be used to make missiles has been intercepted on its way to Teheran, raising new questions about Russia's determination to end assistance to Iran's missile program.
American officials warned the Russian authorities several days in advance that a shipment of steel, which they said was a special alloy particularly suited for use in making fuel tanks for Scud missiles, was expected to leave Moscow, based on United States intelligence reports. 
 But the Russians say that the American information was not detailed enough and that they were unable to stop the truck in time. It was impounded late last month after leaving Russia when customs officials in Azerbaijan stopped it from crossing the border to Iran.
Russia's failure to stop the shipment has become an issue in a broader debate about Moscow's promise to clamp down on the sale of missile technology to Iran.
President Boris N. Yeltsin issued a decree in January tightening controls on the export of missile-related technology to Iran. Moscow insists that it is doing its best to prevent the seepage of such technology to Iran and that the Americans are too quick to politicize the issue.
But American officials say troublesome cases still remain. "It would not be accurate to say they are stonewalling us," an American specialist said. "But it is a hard issue for them, technologically and politically. They want to preserve a relationship with Iran. Some of the cases have gone away, but others remain on the table for us to discuss."
The issue has important military implications for the Middle East, where Israel has expressed alarm that it may soon be within the range of Iranian missiles.
It is also emerging as the major obstacle in the already frayed American-Russian relationship.
American lawmakers have threatened to impose economic sanctions on Russian enterprises or institutions that aid Iran's missile program if Russia does not fulfill its pledges to block the assistance. But the Clinton Administration strongly opposes that step, saying it would disrupt sensitive discussions between Washington and Moscow.
"It's a very serious problem for our relationship with Russia and for the security of the region," Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said in an interview this week. He said the Senate would vote next month on a resolution to impose sanctions "if there's not major progress made in the next 30 days."
The United States has long been anxious about Moscow's close ties with Teheran. Washington has complained that Russia's plans to sell Iran up to four nuclear reactors will make it easier for the country to carry out a clandestine program to develop nuclear weapons, allegations that Moscow rejects.
But the flow of Russian technology to Iran's missile program has also been a cardinal worry.
Iran has begun a program to build a missile dubbed the Shahab 3, which has a range of about 800 miles -- more than twice the range of a Scud missile and long enough to reach Israel, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The missile is based on a North Korean design, but Iran has also turned to Russia to develop the technology.
But the key question is whether Russia is cracking down as promised.
"The 13 cases which our American colleagues have so nicely informed us of have been considered, and we have provided detailed explanations," said Yuri Koptev, the head of Russian Space Agency and the top Russian official on the missile issue, earlier this year. "In the cases where we saw some doubtful aspect, these contacts were severed."
But when Robert Gallucci, the special American envoy on the missile issue, met with Russian officials this week, a number of cases remained unresolved. American officials, for example, are concerned that Iranians are still receiving training in propulsion and guidance technology at Baltic State Technical University in St. Petersburg and perhaps at the Moscow Aviation Institute.
The Russians have yet to complete their investigations of enterprises called Polyus, which is suspected of providing navigation and guidance technology to Iran, and Ni Grafit, which makes material used to coat ballistic missile warheads. A shipment of the material from Ni Grafit was intercepted by the Austrians on its way to Iran.
The Russians have taken some steps. The Government has expelled an Iranian student who was trying to buy missile technology and intervened to cancel an Iranian contract with NPT Trud, which makes missile engines.
American officials say the case is more important as a political test of Moscow's will to act than for its military implications.
American lawmakers, who have been briefed on the steel incident, portray it as an example of Russian incompetence or duplicity. Russians say the critics are insensitive to the difficulties of preventing smuggling in a vast and unruly nation.
The case began when American intelligence learned about the plan to smuggle stainless steel to Iran. The steel can resist high temperatures, and Americans experts say they believe that the Iranians intended to use it to make fuel tanks for Scud missiles. American sources say it was to be transported by company called Moso.
American officials alerted Russian intelligence in March that the steel was to be shipped. But American officials concede that they did not know all the details.
The truck left Moscow several days later for the long drive to Iran and managed to get out of Russia successfully.
Azerbaijan notified the United States on March 26 that its customs officials had detained the truck at Astara on its border with Iran.
Officials in Azerbaijan say the shipping documents misrepresented the type of steel. The shipper was identified as Europalas-2000, which American officials say was a front company.
A sample of the steel was sent to the Americans for analysis. After Azerbaijan stopped the shipment, the Russian authorities arrested three men from Tajikistan in connection with the smuggling effort.
One American specialist said the case was complex.
"It is not clear that we directed the Russians to the right place," he said.
But Congressional critics are likely to ask why customs officers in Azerbaijan were able to stop the shipment when the Russians failed.
Two Senators who met with senior Russian officials on a trip to Moscow earlier this month came away with different impressions on Russia's role in the steel seizure case.
Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, said the Russian Government "could have done better," but in general "jumped right on" the case. Senator Hatch said the problems with Russian cooperation stemmed form the fact that the Russian Government was in a state of disarray after Mr. Yeltsin's decision to dismiss his Cabinet a month ago.
But Senator Gordon Smith, an Oregon Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, had a more skeptical view. "They held up this incident as an example of cooperation on the proliferation issue," he said. "However, it is important for us to verify with whom they are cooperating, the U.S. or Iran."

HEADLINE: On Workfare or in Union, Mourning Over Lost Jobs

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
For the last three months, Paula Delinois, 32, has shown up at Queens Hospital Center at 10 A.M. to work for her welfare check. She registered patients at the clinic and learned how to use the computers. She had hoped it would lead to a full-time job. But like 1,000 other workfare workers in hospitals around the city, she was told on Thursday that her assignment was over.
For the last 25 years, Catherine Washington, 56, has worked as a regular nurse's aide at Harlem Hospital Center. Since she was told she would be laid off on May 1, friends have told her not to bother picking up the plaque waiting for her at the personnel office to mark her years of service. But she still wants it. 
 "I worked hard to get it," Ms. Washington said. She is upset about many things after so much time at Harlem Hospital, but one detail stands out: "Management has not come to face us and say, 'Well, we're sorry.' They didn't say anything."
Ms. Delinois and Ms. Washington are the two faces of the turmoil at New York City's public hospitals. The dismissals have affected roughly equal numbers of union and workfare workers, mostly women, many from the same neighborhoods, who labored side-by-side in the hospitals with a mutual mixture of suspicion and understanding.
This week, both groups were told they had to leave. On Monday, layoff notices went out to 905 paid union workers like Ms. Washington. Then on Thursday, facing a lawsuit that claimed the city was using workfare employees like Ms. Delinois to do the tasks of union employees, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani ordered roughly 1,000 workfare workers out of the hospitals.
In interviews yesterday with both laid-off hospital employees and workfare workers -- at the end of a week of increasing bitterness between the angry unions and the Giuliani administration -- it was clear that neither group was happy about leaving the hospitals.
Regular workers mourned their jobs; some welfare workers mourned the expectation of permanent jobs.
Both sides said that, contrary to the Mayor's long denials, workfare workers had been used to perform jobs currently or formerly handled by unionized workers.
And both sides also said they believed unequivocally that the quality of patient care would decline as nearly 2,000 workers leave the public hospital system within a week.
"Are they going to hurt patient care?" asked Donna Alonzia, 35, who has worked at Harlem Hospital since 1988 as a nurse's aide and was among those laid off. "Who is going to take care of them?"
As an example, Ms. Alonzia said, the city may be able to get by with fewer nurse's aides -- nearly all of whom at Harlem Hospital were laid off -- but the work force will be stretched so thin that patients will go unwashed, unfed and with dirty linen for longer than they do now. And there will be fewer workers around in emergencies.
"We do everything," she added. "Who is going to be there when that patient goes into cardiac arrest?"
City officials said the layoffs were necessary because of a steep decline in the use of the 11 public hospitals, causing what they said was vast overstaffing, particularly at Harlem Hospital.
On Thursday, Mr. Giuliani took that argument to an extreme, saying he would also remove the 1,000 workfare workers to prove that the hospitals are so overstaffed that they can do without both the laid-off employees and the welfare workers.
And, mayoral aides argued, the quality of patient care would not be diminished, as they combined jobs and worked toward what they said were needed efficiencies.
"As far as the future is concerned, the public hospitals will continue to provide high-quality care in a cost-effective and accountable way," said Jane Zimmerman, a spokeswoman for the City Health and Hospitals Corporation, which manages the public hospital system.
Mr. Giuliani's removal of the welfare workers came in reaction to a lawsuit filed by District Council 37, an umbrella organization that represents more than 120,000 municipal workers. The lawsuit claimed that the layoffs were illegal because the Mayor intended to replace regular employees with workfare workers.
City officials said this week that given the skills of many people laid off -- 150 of them were doctors or nurses -- such a replacement could not have been their plan.
But in the interviews yesterday, there was no disagreement among either the laid-off or workfare workers that in many cases, they were doing the same jobs.
"When they knew I was there they went to the bathroom, they went to McDonald's," said Ms. Delinois, who registered patients entering the Queens Hospital's clinics. "They did what they wanted to do because I was doing what they were paid to do."
But, in support of one of Mr. Giuliani's several rationales for the workfare program, several workfare workers in the hospitals said they believed that they were learning skills they could use elsewhere, but they were upset that it would not be at the hospitals.
"I learned computers," said Josianne Trahan, 45, a workfare worker who had been at Queens Hospital for about a year. "I mingled with doctors. I learned about psychiatry.
"I was in process of maybe being hired as permanent," she added. "We felt we're able to do the job."
The biggest difference between the two groups is what comes next. The workfare workers are now back at home, looking for jobs, awaiting their next assignment, or both.
The unionized workers are attending rallies, fighting for their jobs and figuring out how they will survive without their paychecks.
Yesterday, several hundred attended a seminar sponsored by the city on resume writing skills and how to apply for unemployment.
"I feel bad," said Debra Toran, 50, who has worked as a nurse's aide at Harlem for nearly 30 years. "I can't believe it."

HEADLINE: Cuts as Political Art

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
In the political petri dish of City Hall, inhabitants learn to communicate in ways that do not always translate well beyond its walls. What is said is not always what is meant; what is meant is not always said.
Yesterday, for example, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani presented a $34 billion executive budget that proposed significant cuts to the library system and to his Department of Cultural Affairs. Such cuts would seem particularly ruthless when the Mayor has been blessed with a record-breaking surplus of $2 billion and when he is also proposing to use taxes to build "stadia" -- the favored City Hall term for stadiums -- including one for a wildly profitable baseball team that now finds its Bronx home somewhat inconvenient. 
 Mr. Giuliani's proposed cuts to the "culturals" -- another City Hall term -- may indeed say something about his priorities, or how he feels about the people he dismisses as typical liberals. But the advocates and City Council members who self-righteously denounced the cuts knew the truth also known to the Mayor, but which no one verbalized for the benefit of the public: The fight over the "culturals" is political Kabuki.
"Cutting libraries and culture is a ritualistic maneuver between the Mayor and the Council," Councilman Archie Spigner said yesterday evening. "I'm in my 25th year on the Council and it has always been that way, whether it was a Democratic mayor or a Republican mayor. The Mayor proposes the reduction and the Council makes restitution. It's the reality of politics. I don't think the Mayor is serious."
These reflections from the Democrat from Queens were especially refreshing, given that just a few hours earlier he used a microphone to denounce the Mayor's proposal to cut about $16 from the libraries and more than $20 million from cultural affairs. "This likely will result in reduced services and possibly a reduction in hours of operation at local branches," he said, "and will be particularly harmful to our children."
Councilman Stanley E. Michels, a Democrat of Manhattan, then seized the lectern and the moment to equate the library system with Ellis Island. "The library has always been a refuge in this city, for all people in all boroughs," he said. "It has been a means to integrate people with our culture. It was a supreme tool for melting pot, the great mosaic. For us to target the library, of all things, is really shameful."
At the same time, the strange ritual helped the Mayor to hold himself out as the leader who has to make tough choices -- even in times of plenty. Mr. Giuliani said that he planned to withhold an additional $5 million that he would turn over if the library system was able to raise a matching amount from private sources.
"This is a good thing to do for them," he said. "They're just not going to see it that way right away. About four or five years from now, when they start doing their private funding, and they're able to put even more money in the libraries and they're not totally dependent on the city, they're going to really be very thankful."
Silence, rather than thankfulness, was the response of library officials around the city.
But Schuyler G. Chapin, the cultural affairs commissioner, acknowledged last night that the annual ritual comes at a cost: "It's always a very trying time of year."
In the end, what does this say about Mr. Giuliani? Mr. Chapin and Randy M. Mastro, the Deputy Mayor for operations, are quick to point out the financial support that the Giuliani administration has given to a number of educational and cultural programs, from $125 million to Project Read, a literacy program for third graders, to $50 million to Project ARTS, which pays for an arts curriculum in the city's schools.
"There are dozens of pieces to a budget, and they're integrated into a whole," Mr. Mastro said in defending the proposed cultural cuts. "To isolate one or two pieces is to not appreciate the entire, integrated package -- to insure the city's financial future, to advance economic development, and to see that the city lives within its means."
In fact, Peter F. Vallone, the speaker of the Democrat-controlled Council, agreed that the Republican Mayor's budget "is a good budget," albeit one that needs to be made better.
Still, the prospect of this Mayor proposing cuts to the library system conjures up memories: of those staged moments in which he sits in a library, reading to wide-eyed children; of his heroic rescue of Winnie-the-Pooh earlier this year, when some British lawmaker threatened to remove the doll from a small Manhattan library. This, too, is the Mayor who holds himself out as the anti-politician, loath to participate in typical political gamesmanship.
Herbert E. Berman, the chairman of the Council's finance committee, called the process a "very unfortunate and very misguided annual dance" that causes unnecessary heartache for low-paid employees in the arts and library worlds.
"The exercise is so that the Council has something to sharpen their teeth on, so that we feel satisfied that we've accomplished something," he said. "The hope and the anticipation of the Mayor's office is that we'll focus on that and ignore something else. But it just doesn't work that way anymore."
But it does, yesterday's City Hall experience would suggest.

Playing and Paying: Fans Debate the Issue

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

 BODY:
THE City of New York has given its assurances that everything is fine and dandy at Yankee Stadium. Now I'm scared: the wolves are guarding the hen house and telling us, "All's clear."
Who are they reassuring? The hens or the other wolves? 
 The Yankees reopened their doors yesterday, 11 days after a 500-pound extension joint crashed through the upper deck and fell on seat No. 7 in Row A of Section 22. Fortunately, Giacamo Turano's seat was empty then. Last night he returned for the game against Detroit, and this time he was joined by George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner. Steinbrenner sat with the fans in that section for five innings, trying to provide assurances that everything was fine.
Steinbrenner, no doubt, was probably thinking that everything was safe, but not fine. The Yankees still need a new home. You wonder what's next: a stink bomb in the press box? Hamsters in the lavatory? This is not to suggest that the expansion joint that crashed into the seats was anything but an accident. But with Steinbrenner, nothing is beyond suspicion. Especially at a time when his eyes are set on securing a new House That Ruth Built.
In the wake of the accident, the debates and threats surrounding the future of the stadium have been taking an enormous emotional toll on longtime Yankee fans trying to balance nostalgia with pragmatism. Two fans attending last night, Dave and Peggy Garbier, spoke with great passion about the lore and tradition, not merely of the stadium but of its location in the Bronx. Bill Teskey spoke of fears about the common man being shut out by soaring prices to support a greater corporate presence. Joe Cable talked about coming here as a youngster with his dad. Last night, he brought his wife and daughter to the stadium for the first time.
Precisely because of these memories, and the powerful spell they cast, the fans are being held hostage by the Mayor and the Boss. The two of them can shove a new stadium down our throats. If they build a stadium on the West Side, if they move to New Jersey, if they move to Timbuktu, the fans will follow.
"Fans will adjust," Denise Cable said.
"Diehard Yankee fans will go whereever the Yankees are," Joe Cable said. "So, in a way, we are held hostage."
The fundamental question in this hostage situation is who will pay, and how much. "He should pay," Michelle Gubber said of Steinbrenner as she herded her three children to their seats. "If he wants it, he should pay for it."
The Yankees seem destined to have a new home. The Mayor has replaced the late Billy Martin as the Boss's straight man, and the two have formed an alliance to build a new stadium, replete with luxury boxes. The Yankees will become an extension of the Times Square/Disney motif.
The Mayor speaks of the financial benefits of a new home, of how the Yankees and the Mets -- provided they draw like the teams in Cleveland and Baltimore have -- could make the money back in a few years. But a University of Chicago economist, Allen Sanderson, said that it was impossible for cities to earn back the hundreds of millions of dollars they initially spend for a modern baseball stadium.
This is the latest example of politicians and owners trying to strong-arm the public, though there are encouraging signs of resistance.
In Minnesota, the state may proceed with an investigation about whether the Twins and Major League Baseball illegally tried to force it to build the team a new ball park. The issue in that case is whether major league owners are conspiring to pressure fans and public officials into paying for new stadiums, thus giving the owners higher returns on revenue producers like luxury boxes and concession sales.
There is resistance in New Jersey, too, enough to potentially eliminate it as an option for Steinbrenner.
In a recent poll, only 27 percent of New Jersey residents said they wanted the Yankees to move to their state. Nearly half said they wanted the team to stay in New York. Six of 10 residents polled said that Steinbrenner -- not the state or an independent authority -- should pay for a new stadium.
The reality is that the time has probably come for the Yankees to move. The time has come for Steinbrenner to strip-mine somewhere else. He's raked as much as he can get out of the Bronx. Save Yankee Stadium. Better yet, free Yankee Stadium.
Just do it with the Boss's money.

HEADLINE: GIULIANI PROPOSES $34 BILLION BUDGET WITH CUT IN TAXES

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed a $34 billion spending package for New York City yesterday, setting the stage for a fight with Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of the City Council, over which taxes to cut and whether to use city money to help build two new baseball stadiums.
Benefiting from the largest surplus in the city's history, Mr. Giuliani called for a $312 million cut in personal income taxes for city residents over three years. The figure fell short, however, of the $1.4 billion reduction that Mr. Vallone has proposed for the same period. 
 Under the Mayor's plan, the city would provide a married taxpayer an income tax credit of about $40 a year during the next three years, regardless of income. The figure for single taxpayers would be slightly lower. The Speaker's proposal, by contrast, would mean a tax break of $174 a year to the average taxpayer earning between $25,000 and $50,000; for people making more than $200,000, the annual saving would be nearly $1,000.
The Mayor emphasized his readiness to negotiate with Mr. Vallone on the size and nature of the tax cuts as part of a broader discussion on the budget, including the use of a business tax to help finance new stadiums for the Yankees and Mets. And even as Mr. Vallone described his own eagerness to negotiate, he drew the lines of battle.
"No one person dictates what happens in this town," said Mr. Vallone, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor and whose City Council has the final say on both the budget and the Mayor's stadium plans. He added: "As for the Mayor's proposal to use the city's commercial rent tax to help fund new stadiums, fine. We'll listen to that."
Aside from his tax proposal, the Mayor hewed to a budget plan he first announced in January. He said he wanted to use most of a $2 billion surplus from the current fiscal year to reduce future budget gaps and a sizable chunk of it to finance law enforcement and educational programs.
He proposed a 10 percent increase for the Board of Education, for a total of $4.9 billion in city money for the public schools, the highest level ever. The money would be used to give the system's 1.1 million students more arts and music classes and after-school programs for intensive reading lessons.
Yet at the same time, Mr. Giuliani called for steep cuts to the city's libraries and cultural institutions.
The Mayor also intensified his criticism of the city's six community colleges, whose standards he has often derided as lax. Holding a notebook in the air as he stood before an audience of several hundred city office workers, Mr. Giuliani threatened to withhold the $110 million that the city provides to the colleges' budgets unless they started taking attendance.
In addition, Mr. Giuliani repeated his wish to continue a commercial rent tax on big businesses below 96th Street in Manhattan; at his urging the Council had previously agreed to phase it out. During the next several years, at least $600 million from that tax would be used to help build new baseball stadiums, including, possibly, a new ball park for the Yankees, in midtown Manhattan on the West Side.
The budget proposal for the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1, also includes $14 million to add new beds for children in foster care and $7.2 million to help the child welfare agency recruit and retain workers.
But some advocates for children complained that the city failed to invest enough money to provide enough day care for the thousands of welfare mothers who must work for their welfare checks. Others saw inequality in a budget willing to give millions to rich business people at the expense of services used by the ordinary New Yorker.
"One beam fell at a stadium, but school buildings are crumbling every day," said Gail B. Nayowith, the executive director of Citizens Committee for Children of New York, a 54-year-old advocacy group. "I don't think in a year where there's a big budget surplus, kids should be traded off against cultural interests or libraries or tax cuts. We have to think bigger. Are we going to rebuild schools or rebuild stadiums?"
As tax revenues keep flowing from the boom on Wall Street, the debate inside City Hall has centered on how to use the city's growing surplus. Yesterday, the debate between the Mayor and Council zeroed in immediately on what taxes to cut -- not on increasing spending on popular programs -- underscoring how much things have changed in a city that once stood as the symbol of generous social programs.
This year's budget dance began on an unusual note, as the Democratic Speaker pushed for far bigger tax cuts than the Republican Mayor.
"There is irony, if you want to say it right, which is that my proposal helps the poor and their proposal helps the rich more," Mr. Giuliani said. "That's an irony, because the stereotype is that Democrats care about the poor and Republicans care about the rich. My proposal is a bigger break to the poorest New Yorkers."
Mr. Vallone's aides disputed the Mayor's statement. They acknowledged that under the Speaker's proposal, the tax breaks grow as income does, but they said the cuts, as a percentage of income, are bigger for working and middle-class taxpayers.
The Mayor's proposal would work by linking the tax break for city residents with a state tax cut approved in Albany last year. The state cut gradually goes into effect in the next four years, and Mr. Giuliani has proposed using city money to fill in the gaps during the next three years. By the fourth year, when Albany will provide all of the cut -- $125 a year to couples, regardless of income -- the city portion of the tax cut will be zero. In effect, New York City's tax break will end.
By contrast, Mr. Vallone's tax reduction, which he first proposed in January, would be permanent. At the heart of his plan is the elimination of a 12.5 percent surcharge for residents on the city income tax that was approved in 1990 to help the city balance its books, and reauthorized in 1991 to hire police officers.
Attaching himself to a tax cut is an important goal for the Speaker, his aides have said. They believe that in a gubernatorial race, Mr. Vallone's legislative record will be scrutinized for any tax increase he has backed.
The Mayor, who has said that eliminating the surcharge would take away too much revenue from the city, wants the surcharge to be renewed at year's end.
Both tax changes would require approval from Albany. But Mr. Vallone seems to have the upper hand, since many believe that he could kill the surcharge simply through inaction.
In his budget, Mr. Giuliani, for whom keeping growth below the inflation rate is important, boasted that city-financed spending would grow by only half of one percentage point. But Mr. Giuliani reached that number by counting the budget surplus, which he uses for next year's expenses, as having been spent in the current year. That artificially depresses the spending rate, but it was not an issue in the past because surpluses were never this large.
Most analysts, however, say the spending is really growing at a few digits above the local inflation rate of about 2.5 percent. The State Comptroller's office and the Independent Budget Office, both of which monitor the city budget, said yesterday that the spending in Mr. Giuliani's proposed budget was actually up by 6 percent.
In general, the Mayor's proposal was received favorably yesterday by government and Wall Street analysts. At the same time, though, some cautioned that because of the $2 billion surplus this year and the $1.4 billion surplus last year, the Mayor was not taking the right steps in correcting inherent problems in New York's budget.

Chart: "SORTING IT OUT: Tax Plans: Base Rates and Surcharges"
 If you earn money in New York City, you probably pay income tax on it. The tax's base rate is 3.1 percent at the lowest incomes and rises to 4.46 percent.
 But many taxpayers who live in the city have been paying more than that since 1990, when city and state officials approved a temporary tax surcharge to help the city balance its books during the recession. These charges, added to the regular tax rates, range from 0.51 percent to 0.55 percent. This surcharge was reauthorized the following year, when violent crime was surging, with the money dedicated to hiring more police officers. It is scheduled to expire at the end of 1998.
 The surcharges are not applied to taxpayers in the lowest brackets. Individuals begin paying when their annual incomes exceed $14,850. For a single head of a household, the starting point is $19,500, and for a married couple filing jointly, it is $28,500.
 The surcharge means that most taxpayers are paying roughly 12.5 percent more in city income taxes, so many government officials refer to it as the 12.5 percent surcharge.
 
The Competing Proposals
 
PETER F. VALLONE, CITY COUNCIL SPEAKER Proposes letting the surcharge expire on schedule at the end of the year. He is also proposing that the base rates be changed.
 
MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI Proposes that every city taxpayer get an identical tax credit from the city for three years. In the first year, all individuals would get a credit of $50.50; couples filing jointly would get $113. In the second year, the numbers would drop to $32.50 and $90, and in the third year they would be $17.50 and $40.

HEADLINE: On Language;
The Emerging Word, Actually

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
'I have noticed a proliferation of the word actually in telephone conversations," writes Richard J. Durbin, the junior Senator from Illinois. "Without exception it is surplusage and often used to mask deception, as in 'Senator, I'm sorry Mr. Jones cannot come to the phone to discuss your fund-raiser, but actually he is away from his desk on safari.'
"Next to inane voice-mail messages," continues the Senator, "and unconscionable delays before the tape recorder engages, I find this use of the word actually to be the latest scourge of telephone life. Sincerely (actually), Dick Durbin."
He is not asking about the real actually, an adverb meaning "truly, in reality," as used by Thomas Hobbes in his 1651 "Leviathan": "Christ shall come to judge the world, and actually to govern his owne people." Instead, he wonders about what the philologist John Algeo calls a "discourse signal -- a device to relate what the speaker is saying to what someone else has said, or to the situation in which the conversation is carried on." Americans pronounce it with all four syllables and place the discourse signal in the front of a sentence; Britons use it either at the start or, more typically, at the end. 
 H.W. Fowler called it a meaningless word, similar to of course: "The superior-indulgent of course. It seems absurd to tell you but he half-hopes you do not know."
Alistair Cooke, now among the untiring retired, calls them tics, filler words as ubiquitous and unnecessary as I mean and y'know. (Cooke has just been named chairman of Olbom -- On Language's Board of Octogenarian Mentors -- though he insists on calling it OGPU -- Octogenarians Guarding Proper Usage -- because his acronym recalls an old Soviet spy organization.)
But it is not always meaningless. "The British tic," Cooke explains, "can also be used to show that all alone, the speaker has come through a rather difficult personal conflict and made a positive, mature decision, e.g., 'What would you like to drink?' 'I'd like a Scotch, actually."'
The proper use of the word -- in its true, actual meaning -- would go, in Cooke's second example, like this: "What would you like to drink?" "I'll have a Scotch. No, actually, I'd like a martini."
Sometimes the tic is used in mock modesty. To "Do all women succumb to your charms?" the answer might be "They do, actually." Norman Schur, in "British English," notes that the word -- pronounced EK-chill-ee -- may also be used in veiled reproof, as if the speaker feels forced to say it: "Actually, we don't do things that way," or "I was coming to that, actually."
It can be used to mark a contradiction of what the other person has just said. Algeo supplies this: "The director doesn't seem to understand what the play's about." "He's a very good director, actually." Or it can mark the unexpected, vouching for what may seem surprising: "Who won?" "Well, I did, actually."
The Senator from Illinois has asked for a vote. Should we condemn actually as meaningless, overworked and obfuscatory, an affected form of y'know?
No. In its nonliteral form, and when not interjected as mere filler, actually is a subtle device, used differently in British and American English. E. Ward Gilman, editor of Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage, argues that words like actually often improve the rhythm of a sentence and help set off the more important words effectively." I disagree, and would not use it to smooth the flow of a sentence, because that is "surplusage," to pick up Senator Durbin's legal usage. But I would readily use actually (more in speaking than in writing) as a signal conveying a shade of meaning outside the normal semantic rules.
Like a raised eyebrow, a shrug or a pleased wriggle, actually contributes to understanding the speaker's meaning. For example, what's another way to say "Come to think of it"? Actually. ...
 
EMERGING NATIONS
First they were undeveloped nations. That was a put-down, so they became LSD's -- less developed nations. Still patronizing. Finally emerged emerging nations. Now they're still undeveloped and nobody has emerged, but everybody's happy.
Who dreamed up this latest name? The answer can be found in "Commanding Heights: The Battle Between Government and the Marketplace That Is Remaking the Modern World," by Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw. (My own next opus will be titled "Subtitling Books: The Desperate Need for Publishers to Explain Everything on the Front Cover.")
In 1979, a Dutch banker named Antoine van Agtmael went to New York to launch what he wanted to call a third world investment fund. Back in bipolar 1952, the sociologist Alfred Sauvy coined tiers monde, "third world," to describe nonaligned nations that wanted to position themselves between the Soviet and Western blocs. (Tiers was chosen rather than troisieme on the analogy of the French tiers etat, "third estate," referring to the commoners.) In time, third world gained a connotation as much economic as political, and was made up mostly of have-not nations.
"No one wants to put money into the third world investment fund," the banker recounts he was told. Write Yergin and Stanislaw: "Underdeveloped markets was a complete nonstarter. Third world wouldn't do. Nor would the World Bank's favorite, developing nations. 'I knew we needed something positive, uplifting, not negative,' van Agtmael said. And by the time he came to work on Monday morning, he had the answer: emerging markets." In 1984, he wrote a book and titled it "Emerging Securities Markets," which didn't sell too well because it had no exhaustive subtitle, but did establish his claim to the coinage (which will stand until I get an earlier written citation).
Commanding heights, by the way, is a military term that was adopted by Lenin. Attacked by militant Communist comrades in 1922 for the New Economic Plan that seemed to turn back toward capitalism, Lenin assured them he was not backtracking. Why? Because the Bolshevik state would still control the strategic sectors of the economy -- what the Marxist leader called the commanding heights. From that we got the command economy, since replaced by the despised market economy.

HEADLINE: Low Jobless Rate Aside, a Lot of Job Hunters

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
THOUGH the state's economy is roaring ahead with an official unemployment rate of just 3.8 percent, there are still more than 10,000 managerial, technical and professional workers looking for jobs according to the Department of Labor. Why?
Tony Drapelick, with Drake Beam Morin, an outplacement firm with Hartford and Stamford offices, observed, "This is a unique economy where low unemployment doesn't mean high employment. There is a tremendous amount of churn. Companies are changing, finding new markets, merging, buying and selling. People are a resource. When that resource is not needed you get a big front door and a big back door. A lot of people are leaving and a lot are being hired." 
 He speculated that while the unemployment figure remains fairly constant, there are considerably more people unemployed and then re-employed in one year than indicated.
James K. Smith of Canton has been unemployed for five months. With an undergraduate degree in industrial engineering and a master's in business administration, Mr. Smith is the kind of worker in demand. He described his field as operations financial management.
He said he last worked for Rexam Graphics Inc., a British-owned firm in Massachusetts. The company was reorganized, Mr. Smith's boss was transferred and the section eliminated. He helped to phase out his position over several months. He is over the age of 50. "I think age has been a factor," he said, "but a number of companies are looking for more maturity." He also finds companies want to hire him to do exactly what he did before, but "I want to take on more responsibility, do something new." He uses the Internet to check classified ads but sees the same ads month after month. He belongs to a support group sponsored by the Financial Executives Networking Group in Westport. Members trade biographies, telephone numbers and so on, to help each other find work. "I'm coming out O.K. but I'm not sure it will be in Connecticut," he said.
Some members of Mr. Smith's group are tied to Connecticut. They have children in school or relatives in the state. He himself rejected an offer from a company in Kansas because, he says, he did not want to move for that particular job. Still, he thinks he may leave the state.
Mr. Drapelick says that "today the average job lasts for three years; no longer do we have a job for life." At the same time he finds no one remains unemployed for a long time. "The time to find a new job is cut in half from 3 to 4 years ago," he said. "People are getting jobs at small to medium companies. They're the big drivers in this economy."
Another factor in finding a job in Connecticut can be lack of up-to-date contacts in the state. Sameek K. Ray, the managing director for the Indian operations of Stanley Works was an expatriate for many years. When his company changed its market, Mr. Ray lost his job and returned to Connecticut. He says he is eager to work overseas again, offering fluency in German, French and two Indian languages as well as some Japanese; he was learning Russian when Stanley Works closed the Indian operation. He has been unemployed about a year.
Also over 50, he too suspects age may be a factor. "I get a little discouraged," he said. "With all my experience I wonder why I haven't got a job yet. Then I think it might be age or national origin. In a global economy it might still take a few years for American companies to get that idea."
In a twist, companies have a difficult time finding employees willing to go overseas largely because of working spouses. A Coopers & Lybrand study shows that close to half of expatriates leave their companies within two years of repatriation.
Mr. Drapelick said flatly, "Becoming an ex-pat is a high-risk decision because it's a case of out of sight, out of mind." Mr. Ray said he had written countless letters to corporate chiefs, has a couple of promising opportunities and won't give up. "This has been a retirement and I don't think I like it," he said.
Both Mr. Smith and Mr. Ray have offices at Drake Beam Morin and say they are at work full time seeking new employment.
Peter Swan, who worked for Barnes Engineering selling electro-optical products, left the company in 1987 to form his own and said he had eight good years. Now he is back in the job market, with no luck so far.
"Employers want an applicant to have the exact requirements for a job and preferably experience working for a competitor or a close associate," he said. "They don't want to train or assign a mentor. They want someone to be productive from the first minute." To keep his spirits up, Mr. Swan works out; he says he does two miles every day on the treadmill and sticks to a strict regimen of weight lifting.
Janine Johnson, director of the Fairfield County Information Exchange at the Southwest Area Commerce and Industry Association, said there is always some unemployment when people leave voluntarily or their companies merge. "I sometimes wonder," she said, "how many people have started their own business or joined a start-up company. A large percentage of these businesses fail," she said.
Diane Dawson-Brown, who runs an agency called All the Best People in Hartford (it specializes in communications, marketing and advertising jobs), said she sees "some unemployed people who are very pro-active about finding their next position, typically single Moms or someone without a second income."
"Most major corporations, given the same attributes and skills, look carefully and longingly at a minority candidate," said Ms. Dawson-Brown, adding, "I place as many women as men, but there is an old boys' network."
She faults women for not participating enough in professional associations where they would meet other professionals. She says that when men get together they discuss business and it is a good way to find out about new openings.
Ms. Dawson-Brown finds jobs in her areas are in the middle level of companies. "During the 10 years of the recession it was the middle level employee, $40,000-$65,000, who got downsized," she said. "Now that companies are making money again they need them back because their people are overworked and profits are good again."
She added that she finds top-level executive positions, $100,000 and up, are scarce.

HEADLINE: Winegrowing Entrepreneurs To Cultivate Other Fields

BYLINE: By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
TWENTY-FIVE years after the Hargrave Vineyard was established on the North Fork, stimulating the creation of Long Island's modern wine industry, the founders have put it on the market.
The owners, Alex and Louisa Hargrave, are asking for at least $3.3 million for the property, located on Route 48 in Cutchogue. 
 Mr. Hargrave said serious offers were being considered, but declined to give details. Mrs. Hargrave said the couple had hoped to find a buyer who intended to continue the estate's tradition of small-scale production of high-quality wines.
"We would like to have a sense that the buyer won't turn it into a bottling plant," she said. "I would hope that they would have their heart in it."
As a result of the risks the Hargraves took in 1973, many in the wine industry consider Long Island the most prominent and important wine region in the East, with the Finger Lakes in upstate New York ranking second and Virginia third.
The Hargraves asked Marion R. King Realty, an agent in Cutchogue, to screen all inquiries. Their entire property has been put up for sale, including a portion of the wine inventory. It consists of 84 acres, 20 of them under vines; a building housing the salesroom, reception area and stored wine; the fermentation cellar, in another building; several outbuildings, and the Hargraves' rambling house, at the rear of the sprawling property.
The real estate agent has placed advertisements in The New York Times and Newsday, and said she intended to advertise in Wine Spectator. "We've had many calls," she said.
How long have the Hargraves talked about leaving the business? "About 15 years," Mrs. Hargrave said with a laugh. "Actually, it's hard to answer that. Some days you don't want to be in it. Some days you don't want to be anywhere else."
Mr. Hargrave, who is 52 and has long had a scholarly interest in Chinese studies, said he and his wife, 50, wished to turn to other, personal pursuits. "This was a difficult decision in the face of a booming wine market," he said.
Mr. Hargrave, who received an undergraduate degree from Princeton and a master's degree from Harvard in East Asian studies in the 1960's, said he wanted to return full time to his first love. "I'm just exchanging one dusty field for another," he said jokingly.
"I have gotten very involved in historical linguistics," he continued. "For about seven years, I have been writing a detailed comparison of the relationship of archaic Chinese and a number of sister languages. I am doing what is called diachronic comparisons -- that is, between two time periods."
Mr. Hargrave has been squeezing in the work in free moments in the evening, during the day and on weekends, especially in winter, when the vineyard and winery require less time.
"At this point, it has become a much more consuming task," Mr. Hargrave said, "and I would like to put all my energies in it. A vineyard is not for retirement. In fact, it's an Olympic sport."
Hargrave Vineyard defined its intention and limits early on, and since 1980 has produced 6,000 to 10,000 cases, depending on the vintage.
"We could sell everything we make out of the front door," Mr. Hargrave once said. "But then we'd be a tourist winery. We want to be a serious presence in the restaurant and retail market. We aspire to be a petit chateau."
In knowledgeable American wine circles, the Hargrave name, estate and wines have long symbolized the premium quality and rising prominence of Long Island wines. Hargrave wines are found on the lists of prestigious Manhattan restaurants, like the Four Seasons and Lutece, and, on Long Island, of the American Hotel in Sag Harbor, Mirabelle in St. James and Tierra Mar in Westhampton.
The Hargraves, the East End's most Francophile winegrowers, were the first to demonstrate that European grape varieties could be successfully and profitably grown in the island's glaciated soil and maritime climate.
Wine specialists have long observed that Long Island, especially its North and South Forks, seems to share many of Bordeaux's terrain and weather characteristics. The Hargraves planted vines in potato fields and, through trial and error, capitalized on the parallels.
Their successful emphasis on red wines like cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and merlot, and on whites like chardonnay, pinot blanc and sauvignon blanc has coincided with New York State's so-called vinifera revolution, which began with the passage of the Farm Winery Act of 1976. That law made it easy and economical for grape growers to start wineries.
Since then vinifera grapes -- the classic European varieties -- have overtaken native American grapes (like Concord and Niagara) and French-American hybrids (Marechal Foch and Seyval blanc) as the wines that have defined the state's wine industry.
The nonviniferas have dominated the state's other wine regions: the Finger Lakes, Hudson Valley and Lake Erie. But largely because of the precedent set by the Hargraves, they have rarely been planted on Long Island.
The Hargraves' Francophile tastes have turned up in the names of many of their wines: Chardonette, their light, tank-fermented chardonnay; Le Noirien, the top-grade pinot noir; Pinot en Blanc, the pinot blanc; Blanc Fume, the sauvignon blanc, and Petit Chateau (the light, nonreserve cabernet sauvignon). They no longer use the name Fleurette, which designated a light-bodied pinot noir.
Their reserve wines, however, do not have French names and are designated by the Hargraves' so-called lattice label, an unusual laser-cut design depicting white garden latticework fronted by a grapevine.
The Hargraves, celebrities on Long Island, are a striking couple. He is 6 feet 6 inches tall; she is diminutive. Mr. Hargrave's conversation and wit have a dry, ironic, mandarin cast, while Mrs. Hargrave's manner is straightforward and vivacious.
The Hargraves come from prominent families. Mrs. Hargrave's paternal grandfather, Norman Thomas, was the Socialist Party's candidate for President six times. In Mr. Hargrave's family, in Rochester, there are lawyers and bankers.
It seems natural that in the east wall of their formal, oak-paneled tasting room, there is a Louis Comfort Tiffany stained-glass window that reproduces a figure from Millet's painting "The Sower."
Looking back to their early East End days, Mrs. Hargrave said: "We were romantics. We thought that there would be time for reading, writing and reflecting early on. That was never the case. Now, Alex wants more time under his vine and fig leaf -- but doesn't want to cultivate them."

HEADLINE: Q&A: John H. Marburger 3d;
Taking the Reins at Brookhaven Lab

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
THERE was to have been a celebration last year of 50 years of advanced science at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
Instead, to borrow a phrase Queen Elizabeth II used to describe a particularly wretched year for England's royal family, 1997 was an annus horribilis for the laboratory, an Energy Department site that began operations in 1947 at 5,300-acre Camp Upton, a former Army base. 
 First came disclosures that radioactive tritium had been leaking undetected for at least 12 years from a fuel storage tank in the High Flux Beam Reactor building, a premier research tool shut down as a result. The Energy Department will decide later this year whether it reopens.
Then, in May, Energy Secretary Federico F. Pena summarily dismissed the lab managers, Associated Universities Inc., for putting science before safety, throwing the lab's 3,100 employees into turmoil. More disclosures about contamination and safety problems followed.
In March a new manager, Brookhaven Science Associates, won a $400 million contract to operate the lab, and John H. Marburger 3d became the new director.
Dr. Marburger, the president of the State University of New York at Stony Brook from 1980 to 1994 and more recently a professor and researcher in optical science there, comes to his new post determined to gain public confidence that the lab can operate safely.
Success or failure here, he said, may decide whether the lab's high science mission can survive. Thus, he has thrown open the doors to neighbors and critics, inviting them to take part in key cleanup decisions.
Yet to be seen, the critics say, is whether Dr. Marburger can maintain a sense that community counts at a Federal Government site where the Energy Department ultimately calls the shots.
Dr. Marburger, 57, a rare blend of scientist and soft-spoken public-relations natural, was born on Staten Island, grew up in Maryland near Washington and graduated with a bachelor's degree in physics from Princeton University in 1962.
He earned a Ph.D. in applied physics from Stanford University in 1967 and was a professor of physics and electrical engineering at the University of Southern California before going to Stony Brook.
He lives with his wife, Carol, in Port Jefferson. They have two grown sons.
Q. In your view, what is the laboratory's mission?
A. The mission of the laboratory is science. The mission is to do basic research on the structure of matter of all kinds and all scales, and to build and maintain and make available large machines that are used for basic scientific and technical studies in many areas of science.
Q. One of the machines is the High Flux Beam Reactor, which is currently closed because of a tritium leak. Should it be reopened?
A. Brookhaven Science Associates has stated its position as being that if the reactor is useful for science, if it is needed for the national science program and if it can be operated safely without negative impact on health or the environment, then it should be operated.
Q. Can it be operated safely?
A. Well, the studies that are currently commissioned by the Department of Energy are supposed to be directed to that end. The Secretary of Energy has asked for an environmental assessment. We are required in our contract to provide a safety assessment and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is going to do another similar study. So when it comes time for the Secretary of Energy to make his or her decision, there should be a lot of information available about whether or not this reactor can be operated safely.
Q. Do you have a personal view on whether that reactor should reopen?
A. The key words in your question are "that reactor." I know that in general, reactors can be operated safely without negative impacts on health or environment. What I don't know is whether that reactor can be operated safely. It is an older reactor. It is located in a sensitive environment. And it needs to be studied. I need to the results of those studies before I can make up my mind.
Q. We have a Congressman, Michael P. Forbes, Republican of Quogue, and a Senator, Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of Island Trees, who say this reactor should never operate again. Do you have a reaction?
A. They are politicians, and politicians operate in a social dynamic that's different from science. I am a scientist, and I have responsibilities to one of the world's great science facilities here.
Q. You are a scientist, but does this job involve a public-relations aspect you are really not comfortable with?
A. I am perfectly comfortable with the public-relations aspect. I have no problems relating to the public on sensitive issues. That's one of the reasons I am here. I regard myself as part of the Long Island community. I am part of the public too. I care as much about Long Island as I do about Brookhaven National Laboratory.
Q. Some people criticize Brookhaven Science Associates and the Energy Department for giving lip service to the community. Is there any validity in that?
A. Yes and no. I think, unfortunately, the Department of Energy has very structured decision-making processes. The process of environmental impact studies, for example, is highly structured. And I believe that kind of structure makes it very difficult and can be criticized as being somewhat inflexible.
My own approach is to invite the community in to talk with our managers and go over the data we have with them. As the operator, the contractor as it were, to the Department of Energy, I actually have more flexibility than the department does and I can invite people and listen to them, change plans and so forth. So I am looking forward to that. I have invited some people in to work with our people in identifying issues.
Q. Do neighbors have grounds for fear about contamination from the laboratory?
A. Well there certainly has been contamination of the ground water, there is no question about that, and there are plumes of contaminated ground water seeping out underneath the Long Island Expressway and under homes down there that the D.O.E. has already hooked up to county water. That's absolutely an indication that there has been contamination here.
On the other hand, contamination appears to be chemical, not radioactive. There has never been any instances where ground water that has radioactivity in it has exceeded today's very low Federal standards for drinking water. The radioactive part of the concern seems to be quite small. The chemical part is not negligible. It is important to remediate the chemical plumes.
When I go back over the records to try to understand myself what the level of risk might be, I am surprised at how cautious and careful the scientists were about radiation and how careless they were about the chemicals.
Q. So when some people say the amount of radiation from the lab has really been far greater and hasn't been acknowledged, they are simply wrong?
A. Yes, but I like to be extremely careful when I talk to people who have concerns like that. I know that since I am an employee of the laboratory, everything I say could be regarded as self-serving. That's why I personally welcome external regulators or any organization that wants to come and sample the water. There is no data that I would withhold from anybody who was interested in seeing it.
We are not going to be able to do science here in the long run unless we bring the public along with us. We can't stonewall. We are not in a wartime situation where the public will accept almost any hazard. That's not the situation here. We are doing science, and that science mission could be jeopardized by decoupling with the community. That's why it is so important to take these community issues seriously and I really do personally take them very seriously.
Q. You are saying the community could close the lab down.
A. That's true. That's right. In the post-Cold War era, the public has a vastly increased impact on the conduct of science. We still have a national security mission here, but now the security is more related to economic competitiveness.
Q. Energy Secretary Pena is resigning. What would you like from the new Energy Secretary?
A. The thing I would like most right now is enough money to accelerate the cleanup of the laboratory by five years if possible. If I could get the laboratory cleanup done in two or three years rather than seven or eight years, then I think that would help us with the community and we would have a lot easier time convincing the community that we can operate this laboratory in a clean, environmentally sound way.
My first priority is clean up and the interface with the community, and I know that is necessary to continue the science mission. But I also want continued support for the excellent science that is done here. I don't want to lose this talent, which is a resource for Long Island and the nation. Long Island should be proud of the quality of the science that is done here. I'd like to build on that.

HEADLINE: A Rapture for Neglected History

BYLINE: By LORRAINE KREAHLING 

 BODY:
BARBARA GOLDSMITH has always been fascinated by controversial figures who wield exceptional power.
In 1980, her book "Little Gloria . . . Happy at Last," a tale of the custody battle over Gloria Vanderbilt, became a best seller. 
 "Johnson v. Johnson," published in 1987, presented a detailed account of the 1986 courtroom drama between the six children of J. Seward Johnson and his widow over a $500 million estate.
In "Other Powers: The Age of Suffrage, Spiritualism, and the Scandalous Victoria Woodhull," which has just been published by Alfred A. Knopf, Ms. Goldsmith examines the distinctly American odyssey of a 19th-century figure who was both a financial adviser to Commodore Vanderbilt and a carnival clairvoyant.
A woman who had at times accepted money for sex, Victoria Woodhull would go on to share the stage and argue for women's rights with America's premier suffragette, Susan B. Anthony. She would also found her own New York brokerage firm and newspaper and run for President of the United States.
In an interview at the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan, Ms. Goldsmith said that more than simply paint a portrait of Victoria Clafin Woodhull, she wished to capture a time in our nation's history often passed over by historians.
"There have been 3,000 books written about the Civil War, but Reconstruction is a black hole in American history," Ms. Goldsmith said. "America was expanding and people began hacking out new territory, not only in the land but in their minds."
"Other Powers" depicts a nation being challenged to structure a new economy that could no longer rely on the free human labor provided by slavery. Government was trying to legislate the rights of its new black citizens just as women began to speak out about their own neglected rights.
The "other powers" of the title refers to Americans' turn away from the rigidity of Calvinism and Puritanism for "contact" with the divine. Across the country, revivalist preachers traveled from town to town, drawing huge crowds to tents where they inspired Dionsysian-like frenzies.
It was at such a gathering, Ms. Goldsmith tells her readers, that Roxy and Buck Clafin said they had conceived their daughter, Victoria.
"To women repressed in every way, the release provided by a revival was intense," Ms. Goldsmith writes. "The line between religious and sexual ecstasy was often crossed in the excitement."
Ms. Goldsmith said it made sense that women sought spiritual guidance outside the male-dominated religious establishments.
"Women were considered men's property," she said. "Sex was on demand from their husbands, who could beat them without fear of reprisal.
"If a woman worked, her wages went to her husband. If she divorced, she lost custody of her children. A woman could not testify in court or serve on a jury. And, of course, women could not vote."
"Other Powers" tells how Americans, particularly women, also had begun consulting Ouija boards and holding seances to communicate with the dead.
"One in two infants died, and women were the caretakers of the sick and dying," Ms. Goldsmith said. "Contact with their departed loved ones comforted women and made the harsh realities of daily life more bearable."
Through real-life stories, "Other Powers" shows how 19th-century Spiritualism undermined the antimaterialistic bias of Calvinism and the Puritan notion that the purpose of sex was exclusively procreative.
One of the main players in the drama is the minister of Plymouth Church in Brooklyn, Henry Ward Beecher, brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, the abolitionist author.
The downfall of Victoria Woodhull, who had been accused in the press of being a "free lover," was set off largely by her miscalculated public challenge of this very popular minister, a pillar of the Establishment. She urged him to admit that he was living out the gospel of love he preached by having numerous adulterous affairs with his female parishioners.
"Calvinism changed," Ms. Goldsmith said. "So that Henry Beecher could preach God is love. Love is God. You yourselves are gods. Money is good.
"Of course, then as now, there was a disparity between the ideal image a public figure projected and their all-too-human reality," Ms. Goldsmith said.
Before she began writing social history in 1974, Ms. Goldsmith worked as a journalist. Following her graduation from Wellesley College, she wrote celebrity profiles for "The Woman's Home Companion."
"When I was 21 I was put on a plane to interview Clark Gable," she said, "and I had to write 4,000 words on Clark Gable."
Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Alan Ladd and Danny Kaye were among her other early subjects.
Ms. Goldsmith also wrote for McCall's Magazine, The New York Herald Tribune and The New York Times. In 1968 she worked with Clay Felker to start New York Magazine, she said. She later became an adviser to the Hearst Corporation and senior editor at Harper's Bazaar.
Ms. Goldsmith conceded that there was an uncanny parallel between the use of sexual scandal as a political weapon in 19th-century politics and contemporary politics. She said that in both cases it seemed to divert the attention of elected officials away from important issues.
Ms. Goldsmith is a longtime trustee of the New York Public Library, and she said her love for books, history and scholarship had been a lifelong passion.
"My grandfather was a doctor, and we had a wonderful library, and I was a lonely kid, and I read my way through his library," Ms. Goldsmith said. "My father was a history buff and every dinner would be a history quiz. I later inherited all of his history books."
In 1988, through a foundation set up with money from the estate of her father, Joseph I. Lubin, who was the chairman of the board for the Pepsi-Cola Company, Ms. Goldsmith endowed the Goldsmith Preservation Libraries of the New York Public Library with $1 million.
The author said that the time she spent working with the library's rare books and manuscripts was unusually satisfying for her.
"To go into the preservation lab, I say it is like my 'Breakfast at Tiffany's,' " Ms. Goldsmith said. "I love the scent of the aging volumes and I love the silence."
A striking example of the benefits of the New York Public Library's vast antique collection was its ability to supply concrete evidence of the residences of Polish Jews before World War II.
"We had the only copies of the City of Warsaw telephone books," she said. "After the war it was the only way Jews could get reparation claims."
Recognizing the threat posed by the steady deterioration of most paper, Ms. Goldsmith's spearheaded a movement 15 years ago to limit the use of paper containing acid.
Today, thanks to pressure from publishing professionals and authors organized by Ms. Goldsmith, all trade hardcover books and important United States-Government documents are printed on acid-free paper. This will increase their life span from 50 years to 300 years, Ms. Goldsmith said.
The author has made another kind of pledge to protect written words that might otherwise be lost. In 1987 she founded the PEN Freedom to Write Award, which goes annually to an imprisoned writer or writers.
"The newspapers and other media have so cooperated that we have succeeded in getting most of these people who would have been disappeared or killed, out of jail," Ms. Goldsmith said.
Writers from 22 countries, including China, El Salvador, Indonesia, Kenya, Syria and Vietnam have been recipients.
In her own work, the author said she had tried to focus on careful research and objective reporting, and that she had been surprised by the popularity of her books.
"I work very hard to document everything," Ms. Goldsmith said. "I always wrote a book as honestly and as best I could. I never really expected that I would have a large audience."
A decade of research and writing went into "Other Powers." Ms. Goldsmith said she measured the success of any book by whether or not readers felt they had entered the world created by the author.
"I want readers to feel like they have stepped right into this age," Ms. Goldsmith said. "I want them to see the tobacco juice on the floor or the velvet on the walls of Victoria's house, things we actually know were there."
Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Richard Bernstein wrote, "Ms. Goldsmith keeps interpretation to a minimum. The most conspicuous elements of her book are the richness of its narrative, the complex and morally nuanced portraits of its characters and the author's tendency to present the little-known facts without judgment so readers can decide for themselves."
In the years of work on "Other Powers," Ms. Goldsmith said she sometimes felt overwhelmed by the prospect of organizing the research, books and documents that filled her offices, both at her Park Avenue apartment and in her East Hampton home.
"Writing 'Other Powers' was like being held under water for 10 years," Ms. Goldsmith said. "I really began to live in that age, so that I would go to dinner parties and have very little conversation. I would be on automatic pilot all the time."
The author said that when she was at her home in East Hampton and was frustrated by her work, she often retreated to the backyard hedge with pruning shears.
"When the writing isn't going well, I love to attack the privet," Ms. Goldsmith said. "I have this forest of privet in the backyard, and I go out and attack the privet."
She also spoke to her friend and former editor at Knopf, Robert Gottlieb, about the daunting task of pulling together the research for "Other Powers."
"I told him, 'Bob, I have enough material for 10 good books,' " Ms. Goldsmith recounted. "And he said, 'Well, if you only have enough material to write one book, you probably shouldn't be writing it. A good book is what's left because you have made the informed decision to throw everything else away.' "

HEADLINE: Sue Kelly: An Upstart Settling In

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: KATONAH

 BODY:
HER detractors reside on both sides of the aisle, with many Democrats viewing her as a Newt Gingrich clone and some in the conservative wing of the Republican Party, her own party, rejecting her as a liberal. What no one disputes -- not even her supporters or Representative Sue W. Kelly herself -- is that the Congresswoman from the 19th District has been a controversial figure on Capitol Hill, especially when it comes to environmental matters.
But Mrs. Kelly, who is in her second term, insists that those who vilify her as a foe of the environment and a turncoat in office have misread her campaign promises. "I am exactly who I represent myself to be," said the 62-year-old Mrs. Kelly -- a fiscal conservative and social moderate -- recently from her district office here. 
 In her race to return to Congress for a second term, she was challenged in the Republican primary by Joseph J. DioGuardi, a former two-term representative who called her a "Democrat in disguise" with liberal views on abortion and gay rights.
But Mrs. Kelly, a former real estate broker, advocate for women's health issues and junior high school teacher, has provoked the most ire among environmentalists.
"In the 19th Congressional District, which has a long and illustrious history of giving green leadership to the nation, Sue Kelly is a disappointment," said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., one of Mrs. Kelly's most outspoken critics and the chief lawyer for the Riverkeeper, an environmental group in Garrison. "Unlike her predecessor, Mrs. Kelly is out of touch with her constituents."
The predominantly Republican 19th District covers part of White Plains and all of Westchester north of White Plains as well as Putnam County and parts of Orange and Dutchess Counties. For nearly three decades before Mrs. Kelly was elected, the district was represented by Hamilton Fish Jr., a moderate Republican with a strong environmental record.
Mrs. Kelly initially angered supporters in the environmental community during her first year in Washington when she voted for bills they believed would eviscerate existing laws -- especially those that benefited the Hudson Valley. The final straw, many environmentalists said, was Mrs. Kelly's support of revisions to the landmark 1972 Clean Water Act.
Referring to H.R. 961, the packet of changes that some environmentalists nicknamed the Dirty Water Act, she said, "I saw this as a way to bring money to New York, but it set the stage for people mistaking my position on the environment." Mrs. Kelly said she disagreed with language in the revisions that could sharply reduce protected wetlands but supported the package because it would bring $1 billion in Federal funds to the state for improvements like upgrading sewage-treatment plants.
Admittedly naive and politically unseasoned in the beginning, the Congresswoman said she learned the first of many difficult lessons that year.
"It took me a while to settle in," she said. "There was so much legislation coming so fast in those first 100 days, and I didn't have the historical perspective on it."
Despite her good intentions, a firestorm exploded at home. Her detractors picketed Mrs. Kelly's district office here, faxed letters to newspapers and spurned her invitation to them to serve on an ad hoc advisory committee, which she was forming. Even though she said she never strayed from pledges made as a candidate, groups like the Hudson Riverkeeper Fund and the Sierra Club railed against her as a traitor.
"I told people that what you see is what you get," Mrs. Kelly explained then.
"I signed the Contract With America, and I'm an environmentalist. As far as I can see, I haven't done anything off that message."
As she began to tap into the heart of her constituency, "the cacophony calmed down," Mrs. Kelly recalled recently.
Perhaps most meaningful to the voters at home was her vote for a law authorizing $17.5 million in Federal funds toward the acquisition of Sterling Forest in Tuxedo, N.Y.
The Congresswoman also gained the endorsement of the New York League of Conservation Voters by stating in a questionnaire that she supported so-called green -- and un-Republican -- causes like eliminating giveaways of Federal mining and grazing rights, improving gas mileage in cars and preserving wetlands.
This year, the Washington-based League of Conservation Voters, a political arm of a national environmental coalition, rated her among the most improved members of the House of Representatives. The group gave Ms. Kelly a score of 81 of a possible 100 points for her record last year, compared with a score of 58 in the 104th Congress the year before.
It may, however, have been but a brief respite from criticism. Early this month, representatives of local, regional and national environmental groups held a news conference on the banks of the Hudson River at Croton Point Park to protest House Bill 1704, which Representative Kelly introduced recently.
The bill, known as the Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis Act, would establish an office with a yearly budget of $35 million to review new regulations to determine their impact on business and the economy. Environmental groups called the proposal a thinly veiled and costly initiative to elevate industry profits above health and safety concerns.
"Mrs. Kelly's record on the environment has been very, very inconsistent," said Jeffrey D. Fullmer, state program director for the Citizen's Campaign for the Environment, a statewide nonprofit advocacy organization. "Her actions often belie her words."
Paul J. Elston, chairman of the New York League of Conservation Voters, said that despite the Congresswoman's earlier turnaround on matters of open space, clean water and the Hudson River, "skepticism and concern continued in the environmental community." He added, "Good performance in the past is not an excuse for poor performance today."
Calling it a stealth attack on environmental laws, Mr. Kennedy said the bill had "nothing to do with good government and lots to do with the jingle jangle of industry money."
In response, Mrs. Kelly said the new office would have no authority to stop or amend any regulation, but it would advise Congress on regulatory matters.
As the lawmaker said during a recent interview, "I'm going to continue to do what I went down to Washington for, and that's to create a smaller, smarter government."
For her part, Mrs. Kelly said Mr. Kennedy, who lives in the 19th District, was "sparring on a partisan basis" because he wanted her job.
Mr. Kennedy denied having designs on a Congressional seat. "The easiest thing is for a politician to imply that there is a motive," he said. "But the fact is that it's a bad law, and there's no defense for it."
In contrast to those who oppose her, supporters of Mrs. Kelly say she is a pro-environment lawmaker, a hard worker and committed to representing her constituency.
"We're neighbors in Congress and have worked together on many issues, like Sterling Forest and the Hudson River," Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, a Republican from the 20th District, said. "I have a high regard for Sue."
Mr. Gilman called Mrs. Kelly's record on the environment good and suggested the flap would die down in time. "As all new members, she has been the subject of criticism," he said.
Charles I. Keane, the former director of the Museum of the Hudson Highlands near West Point, praised Mrs. Kelly's work on behalf of the Hudson River's shoreline and Manitou Marsh on the east bank of the river north of the Bear Mountain Bridge. "I'm not political," Mr. Keane said. "I'm a biologist mainly. But Sue Kelly helped us obtain funds for a Hudson River restoration project. She has been one of the moving forces."
Representative Kelly said that she often wearies of the criticism. "I've fought for these causes authorization by authorization and appropriation by appropriation," she said, adding that she is and always has been a steward of the Hudson River, clean water and open spaces. "It's like asking, 'When did you stop beating your wife?' " she said. "They're casting me in an unfair light, and it has made me very unhappy."

HEADLINE: More State Aid Helps Schools Prepare for Vote

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
PERHAPS it is El Nino, or maybe it is the spillover from Wall Street's largesse, but for the first time in many seasons most school districts are in the surprising situation of looking at increased state aid from Albany to bolster the 1998-99 school budgets, which will be presented to voters on May 19. Most residents will be asked to vote on local school spending that day, with a few exceptions, including Yonkers -- one of the cities that does not vote on school budgets -- and the special-act districts in the county.
Under current state law, school districts may present budgets to voters twice. Should the budget be defeated on its second vote, districts are obligated to adopt a contingengy, or austerity, budget. Austerity budgets can now include funds for things like interscholastic athletic programs and extracurricular activities. 
 For the most part, the proposed budgets -- devised by district superintendents and business managers, boards of education and citizen budget committees -- reflect a partnership, which is focused on curriculum, program and student needs. And in marked contrast to some recent budget seasons, where contentious and well-organized opposition to proposed budgets divided communities, a changing political and economic climate seems to have gained supporters. Even with relatively modest tax-rate increases -- with most falling within the 2 to 5 percent range -- districts are seeking to enhance their programs even as they plan for increased enrollment.
There are some exceptions -- notably Greenburgh Central 7, Blind Brook, and Katonah-Lewisboro -- where the spending increases and tax-rate increases either hover near or exceed 10 percent, but for the most part, this is shaping up as a very different sort of budget season.
"It has been an interesting year," Dr. Donald R. Kusel, Superintendent of the Tarrytowns public schools, said. "It's as if everybody wants to outdo everybody else in helping education. I like what we're hearing about support for education. It's important to have viable public education."
So in Edgemont, for example, where voters will decide on a $22.1 million budget that will increase taxes by 3.68 percent, program enhancements will include an enrichment teacher to extend classroom challenges at the elementary level and a science laboratory and a photography darkroom (financed in part by the Edgemont Education Foundation) for the high school.
"We have been able to provide in this budget for high-quality education at a fair cost and offer an enhancement of the program in a more comfortable budget," said Nancy L. Taddiken, Superintendent of Edgemont.
Similarly, in Rye Neck, the proposed $16.6 million budget represents a 5.08 spending increase over the previous year and reflects the district's efforts to continue and expand program improvements.
"We're looking at a 5 percent enrollment increase, in large part because of a new housing development known as the Preserve," Dr. Peter J. Mustich, Superintendent of Rye Neck, said. "It's a very thoughtful budget that raises standards for all students. Our program requires additional support. With the increased enrollment, we have to add staff. The community is seeing the results of our improvements and sees substantive changes in the schools. We're getting younger families who are concerned about the schools."
And in other communities facing the challenges of maintaining and improving the academic program while managing increased enrollment, similar tax-rate increases are proposed. In White Plains, the $98.5 million budget includes allocations for 13 new teachers, a spending increase of 3.4 percent and a 5.5 percent tax-rate increase. Ardsley's $27 million budget would raise taxes by 2.75 percent, while Scarsdale's $59.9 million budget reflects a 5.2 percent tax-rate increase.
"We're in pretty good shape," Dr. William French, interim Superintendent of the Scarsdale schools, said. "We've been out and touched all the bases in the community and gotten some minor suggestions, but we don't anticipate problems."
Still, districts are far from proposing sizable increases in spending or tax rates. The Southern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services, for example, has proposed a budget that represents little cost increase to member districts.
Despite the almost serene atmosphere, educators remain cautious about the final disposition of their proposed budgets.
"Part of state aid is really reimbursements for expenditures school districts have made," Dr. Kusel said. "Here's the caution. If a school district is told it will get $1 million this year, we know it is a very good year for the state. Part of our dilemma is not only, What am I getting this year? but What am I getting next year? Districts tend to look past the now to not get clobbered in the future. There is concern among educators whether the Governor can keep funding at these levels if the economy changes."

HEADLINE: Why 'Titanic' Conquered the World

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
LONG before "Titanic" the movie, the enduring appeal of Titanic the story had already been proved by books, plays, exhibitions, documentaries and other films. Even so, who could have gauged the world's appetite for more? Until the last several months, fascination with accounts of the ship that went down in the North Atlantic in April 1912, killing more than 1,500 people, had been largely limited to the United States and Europe. Yet the movie was able to captivate audiences even in countries where the sinking of the unsinkable was never part of popular lore. And for them the movie became the story.
So what was it about James Cameron's blockbuster that turned it into what is surely the highest-grossing film of all time? Although it is finally showing signs of slowing down at the box office in the United States, it is still roaring along abroad, and has so far earned about $1.5 billion over all, apparently surpassing even "Gone With the Wind," adjustments for inflation notwithstanding. 
 Certainly, this could not have happened without Hollywood's money, screencraft, special effects, publicity machine and, most important, distribution network. But the movie struck virtually every market, big and small, with such force that it became impossible not to know of its existence, not to have heard Celine Dion sing the theme song and eventually, it seems, not to have seen the screen ship go under.
A quick tour d'horizon of why the film has drawn such a strong reaction around the world provides other -- more emotional, less commercial -- reasons: "Titanic" tells a story that is perceived to be true; it is a tragic love story of operatic dimension because the denouement is known; it demonstrates the terrifying and mystical power of nature, and it has in Leonardo DiCaprio a fated working-class hero with whom teen-age girls fall in love. In other words, it is a fine old tear-jerker and everyone likes a good sob.
Still, different countries have viewed the phenomenon of "Titanic" in their own ways. The sight of British aristocrats displaying stiff upper lips in face of adversity appealed to the Japanese sense of "gamen." But some British critics thought the movie anti-British. The French dwelled on the hidden political message of the movie (better food in first class, better dancing in third). And one German intellectual saw the ship's fate as punishment for the arrogance of modern technology. "Nature strikes back!" he said cheerfully. Whatever the explanation, "Titanic" has already grossed more than $100 million in each of these countries.
The Chinese have been rushing to see the film, but because it is being shown in just 127 theaters in China, a sidewalk market in pirated videos is flourishing. How could the Chinese not want to see the movie when their very own Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, praised it in a speech to the National Peoples Congress? Of course, he was not talking about the art of movie making. For him, "Titanic" was a great example of venture capitalism at work.
So the unsinkable movie floats on, showering both friend and foe with evidence not only of Hollywood's power to make money -- to date, about $543 million in the United States and about $933 million more in the rest of the world -- but also of its ability to shape the world's imagination, to the point that hundreds of millions of people will eventually have this experience in common. Indeed, the film has become a point of cultural reference. This month at the Paris Opera, for instance, the audience erupted in applause when a shipwreck in "L'Italiana in Algieri" by Rossini was represented by a sinking Titanic. A review of reactions in some of the 56 countries outside the United States in which the film is being shown confirms just that: as an image, as a story, as a metaphor, as a movie, there is still no escaping "Titanic."

HEADLINE: Why 'Titanic' Conquered the World;
Cairo

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

 BODY:
Most of the films showing in Egyptian cinemas these days tend to highlight the gritty side of life: poverty, street thuggery, even a vulgar competition for the affections of a man married to two women. Not so "Titanic," of course, and critics say that this is an important reason that the American movie has so quickly become beloved in a country whose own classics have always reached for the romantic heights.
Egyptians may grumble a lot these days about American arrogance, but they are also flocking to see "Titanic" in such numbers that theaters showing the film are still fully booked more than a week in advance. 
 "This is something that takes them away from what they see on the street, away from the depressing football matches on television and back to the romance of the old Arabic movies," said Khaled Farahat, one prominent critic. "Romance is something cinema direly lacks now."
Some recent American-made films -- most notably "Independence Day" -- have kindled a backlash among Egyptians who read their plots and popularity as proof that Americans are determined to dominate the world. But this spring, even on weekdays at 3:30 A.M., Cairenes have been streaming away from movie houses starry-eyed about a tale that appeals equally as love story, tragedy and window to grand possibility.
"It is not an American movie," said Rania al-Razaz, a graduate student at the American University in Cairo who had waited more than a week to get a ticket to "Titanic." "It is a human movie." DOUGLAS JEHL

HEADLINE: 'Troubling Legacy Of Conversions'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Troubling Legacy of Conversions" March 22 assumes that resident shareholders suffer when sponsors retain ownership of their shares in co-op buildings. 
 In many cases, the resident shareholders allegedly harmed were "insiders" who knew that a significant percentage of the rent-regulated units would not be purchased. "Outsiders" clearly knew the percentage of unsold units when they bought.
Even if a purchaser assumed that all units would be sold eventually on turnover, that might not be in the best financial interest of the co-op now. Once the original regulated tenant moves out, the sponsor can re-rent the unit at a market rent. Thanks to the healthy rental market, this is certain to cover the maintenance expenses, with the excess often providing the sponsor with a better rate of return than selling the apartment and, say, buying Treasury bills.
A financially healthy shareholder is good news, and a sponsor commanding market rents will have an incentive to promote good building maintenance. Further, retaining ownership of market-rent apartments insures that the sponsor will have money available to pay the maintenance for the money-losing rent-regulated apartments.
The downside, as noted in the article, is the reluctance of banks to offer financing for co-ops in which there is a high percentage of rentals. Unfortunately, the banks are still reacting to mistakes they made in financing conversions in the 80's. The solution, however, is for banks to go back to basics by underwriting based on value, not to penalize sponsors for pursuing their economic self-interest.
It's ironic that resident shareholders seem more intent on suing their fellow-shareholding sponsors than in identifying their common problems.

Losing A Co-op's Papers

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
CHRISTOPHER DALRYMPLE recently decided that interest rates had fallen enough to warrant refinancing his co-op share loan. A producer for CBS News, he had more than enough income to qualify for the loan, as well as 11 years of on-time loan payments behind him.
Within days, Mr. Dalrymple got a commitment at a locked-in interest rate of 7 1/8 percent. Then things came to a halt. "My original lender lost my stock certificate and proprietary lease," Mr. Dalrymple said. "It ended up costing me $400 to keep my rate after the lock-in expired and another $500 to have a replacement certificate and lease drawn up by the managing agent." 
 Last Wednesday, the bank reimbursed Mr. Dalrymple for the cost of the replacement certificates, so the situation involves a relatively small amount of money. But the lender's inability to find his original certificate has ominous implications.
"It seems to be happening a lot with all the bank mergers and acquisitions," said Paulette Bonnano, a vice president at National Cooperative Bank in Manhattan.
She said that as the banking industry consolidates it is becoming increasingly common for lenders to lose track of the mortgage papers, notes, stock certificates and proprietary leases that serve as evidence of their security for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of mortgages and share loans.
Unlike mortgages, which are promptly recorded in county clerks' offices, the stock certificates and proprietary leases that provide security for co-op share loans are often not recorded anywhere. As a result, those documents generally must be produced at the time of a sale or a refinancing.
Unlike Mr. Dalrymple, who was refinancing his own mortgage, co-op owners who are selling their apartments may not always be able to convince an eager buyer to wait a couple of weeks for the original lender to produce -- or discover it has lost -- the original documents needed for the closing.
"In the last several years we've had a growing number of stock certificates and leases supposedly lost by lenders who appear unwilling to put in much effort to find them," said Howard Schechter, a Manhattan lawyer who represents Mr. Dalrymple's co-op board. "It seems to be getting more and more difficult for lenders to retrieve paper documentation. Some of this paper has important legal significance."
Mr. Schechter explained that when shares to an apartment are transferred from one owner to another, the transfer agent needs the original certificates to provide new documents for the buyer.
If the current owner cannot produce the originals, he said, the transfer agent will not complete the sale because it is possible that a lender may be holding them as evidence of a lien against the apartment.
This is not just a remote possibility, Mr. Schechter said, because before 1988, when a state law was amended to allow for the filing of lien documents for share loans, lenders frequently made no official filing of their liens against property.
While lenders now file notice of their liens with the county clerk, in the case of loans originating before 1988, the only way that a transfer agent can be assured that all liens against the property have been satisfied is by requiring the return of the original documents.
Occasionally, of course, shareholders themselves misplace the documents. In such cases, Mr. Schechter said, a shareholder who needs replacement certificates is typically required to provide the co-op with an affidavit saying his documents are truly lost.
Last year, however, co-op boards received unsettling news: A New York State Supreme Court justice ruled that a co-op that had provided a replacement certificate to a shareholder selling his apartment was liable to a lender who later produced the original certificate as evidence of an unpaid lien on the property.
"The shareholder sold the apartment and lied to the co-op board about losing his stock certificate and proprietary lease," said Richard Nardi, a Manhattan co-op lawyer and former president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of New York, who represented the shareholder's original lender.
That, Mr. Nardi said, has made co-op lawyers and boards exceedingly skittish about issuing replacement certificates and leases.
As a result, he said, shareholders who have lost their documents are generally required to provide the co-op with an affidavit of loss and agree to accept responsibility for any liens outstanding at the time the replacement certificates were issued.
 However, said Mr. Nardi, since such an agreement is only as good as the shareholder's ability or inclination to abide by it, some co-op lawyers are recommending that boards require shareholders who need replacement documents to furnish a bond. Mr. Schechter, who endorsed that practice, said that such a bond can cost as much as 3 percent of the fair-market value of an apartment.
And since lenders who lose stock certificates or leases will not likely submit to a requirement to post a bond to obtain replacements, boards should at the very least require the lender to reimburse the co-op for future losses that may result from the issuance of replacement documents.
 Deborah O'Uhuru, president of Residential Capital Corporation in Manhattan, said that shareholders who are selling their apartment or refinancing their mortgage should notify their current lender as far in advance of closing as possible.
' Mr. Schechter said that the same thing would apply for shareholders selling their units.
"You certainly shouldn't wait until you've scheduled the closing," he said. "The more notice you give them, the better off you are."

Ups, Downs and Ups in Newark

 BODY:
THE people in Newark who in just seven months have presented more ballet, folk dance and symphonic music than the city has seen in decades are about to put their brand new culture palace in context.
Starting tomorrow, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center will offer "Bricks, Mortar and Spirit: The Endurance of Newark," four seminars illuminating significant aspects of the city's history, through good times and bad. It emphasizes the hope of redevelopment that has infused the city since the center opened in October. 
 "From the inception of NJPAC, there were many goals and the pulling together of many resources from around the state to support Newark," said Barbara Bell Campbell, a trustee of the arts center and the chairwoman of its cultural legacy committee. "The arts center is doing what the arts must do: serving as a humanizing force."
"It was the expressed desire of many people to connect further with the city of Newark," said Ms. Campbell, who recently retired as president of the Amelior Foundation, which awards grants to urban education projects. "Many who knew it before the 1967 riot can see possibilities. Many who are new have expressed curiosity about the past, present and future. This was a new opportunity to explore the fabric of the city through intellectual discourse."
The seminars will start tomorrow with an examination of Newark's rise as a 19th-century industrial center, proceeding through the more difficult times that gripped the city in the 1960's: social anxieties, the rise of suburbia and the decline of manufacturing. The May 11 session will look more closely at suburbanization and its effect on urban policy, with a look to the future.
In the third session, on May 18 at Trinity-St. Philip's Cathedral, a short walk from the arts center, panelists will discuss their research and perceptions of the city and discuss the role of ethnicity and race in 20th-century Newark.
The final session will be a tour of selected sites and neighborhoods. Dr. Clement Alexander Price, chairman of African-American studies at Rutgers University-Newark, who helped formulate the program, and Dr. Kenneth A. Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia University who is an expert on the development of suburbs, are among the scheduled speakers.
The lectures will begin at 5:30 P.M. The final session on May 31 includes the tour, at a time to be announced. Tickets: $85 for the series; $25 for individual events. Information: (800) 466-5722.

Another School Funding Suit Creates a 3-Ring Legal Circus

BYLINE: By Jennifer Preston; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
In the latest legal assault against the way New Jersey pays for public schools, a coalition of 25 middle-income school districts filed a lawsuit last week asking the courts to order the state to come up with a new way to finance public education.
This is now the third lawsuit pending against the state that contends the existing state aid formula is unconstitutional. The state Supreme Court ordered New Jersey last year to come up with $246 million to help end the spending disparity between the state's wealthiest and poorest school districts, and is now considering requiring the state to spend $312 million more. 
 Last fall, 17 rural school districts, mostly in southern New Jersey, moved ahead with a lawsuit of their own that also claims the existing system is inequitable.
With the middle-income districts, the debate is not about rich versus poor. It is about property, and the difficulties that school districts face asking already overburdened property taxpayers to pay even more.
The Association for Middle-Income Districts argues that the state's school aid formula promotes unequal tax rates. Too many school districts, the group says, must levy higher property taxes than others to keep their public schools afloat. Take, for example, the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District, one of the districts that has joined the suit. Its property tax rate last year was $2.08 for every $100 of assessed value, far above the state average of $1.31.
Those who filed suit want the state to cap the property tax rate at the state average of $1.31 for every $100 of assessed value, and make up the difference to school districts. The price tag, they estimate, is $1 billion.
Pete McDonough, chief spokesman for Governor Whitman, said that the complaints of the middle-income districts do not belong in the courtroom. "We believe that education funding should be handled as a matter of policy, not a matter of litigation," he said.
Attorney General Peter Vernerio made a similar point before the State Supreme Court last month while arguing that the state should not be forced to spend $312 million more in the most financially needy districts. He said the Governor and the Legislature, not the courts, should be deciding how to allocate state money for school programs.
The Governor and the Legislature were elected to tax and spend, not the state's Supreme Court justices. But until the Legislature and Governor Whitman address the state's overreliance on property taxes to finance public education, they run the risk of having the courts decide for them.
That is what happened just last year in New Hampshire, where the highest court ruled that the responsibility of paying for public schools belonged to the state.
New Jerseyans have been clamoring for property tax relief for some time. Two-thirds of what is collected in property taxes goes to schools in most communities. Yet despite the concerns about taxes, voters approved 74.6 percent of the school budgets in last Tuesday's election. School board officials said the state's strong economy helped produce the high approval rate, but warned that the state's overreliance on the property tax to pay for education will continue to plague schools and taxpayers.
Yet before any significant property tax relief can take place, New Jerseyans need to ask themselves a few difficult questions. Are they willing to trade lower property taxes for an increase in statewide taxes, like the income tax or sales tax? The money has to come from somewhere.
And are New Jerseyans willing to give up their cherished "home rule" style of government, which has led to the creation of more than 500 different school districts? Are they willing to give up some degree of local control over their schools and share costs and decisions with neighboring school districts?
To her credit, Governor Whitman put those hard questions on the table earlier this year in her annual address to the state Legislature. She emphasized that she opposed forced regionalization of school districts. But she did call for a referendum so that voters could send a direct message to their elected officials about what course they want to be taken.
At the time, some lawmakers criticized the Governor, saying that elected officials, not the voters, should be making those decisions. But a voter referendum would provoke a statewide debate on the issue. The public needs to know what it will be giving up and what it will be gaining.
So school districts do not need the courts to be making the decisions here. It is the people of New Jersey who need to decide what it is they really want. And they need to spell that out for their elected officials.
Maybe, then, property tax bills would fall. Or, at least, people would no longer have an excuse to complain about them.

HEADLINE: VIEWPOINT;
What the Biggest Cities Can Learn From the Upstarts

BYLINE: By JOEL KOTKIN 

 BODY:
WHEN Richard J. Riordan, an entrepreneur who made a fortune as a venture capitalist in the booming 1980's, became Mayor of Los Angeles in 1993, he confronted a city still smoldering from the riots of the previous year, a virtually moribund economy and a city budget heading deeply into the red. Yet the Mayor saw the collapse of the local business leadership as perhaps his greatest long-range problem.
Many once-powerful locally based companies -- Carter Hawley Hale and Security Pacific Bank, among others -- had already disappeared and others were threatening to leave. 
 "As things were changing and getting worse, the C.E.O.'s in L.A. lost their power and their commitment," Mr. Riordan told me recently. "When the older guys gave up, there was no leadership, no strong group who considered commitment to the city and philanthropy important."
The Mayor's observation reflects the concern in cities nationwide about the role of business leaders in their communities. Because of mergers, shareholder pressure and economic globalization, many of the nation's biggest cities are facing new problems rallying strong civic leadership from executives. Although such business elites have often been attacked as fundamentally undemocratic and self-interested, there may be only one thing worse than having a class of civic-minded local leaders -- not having one at all.
"Globalization has changed people's loyalties," said Mike R. Bowlin, chairman and chief executive of Atlantic Richfield,long one of the linchpins of the Los Angeles business establishment. "Twenty years ago, ARCO had Los Angeles in its heart, and we were more of a regional company. Today, our operations are all over the country and the world. So the shareholders have to ask, 'Why is Los Angeles more important to you than Singapore?' "
As engaged business elites have weakened in cities like Los Angeles and New York, new ones are flourishing in upstart places like Seattle; Atlanta; Irvine, Calif., and the Research Triangle of North Carolina. John Kasarda, president of the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, credits the growth of new regional power centers to advances in transportation and communications. Executives from cities like Portland, Ore., and Orlando, Fla., can now take direct flights to Europe, Latin America or Asia. More important, technology allows transmission of information from remote locations in ways that were impossible just a few years ago.
A look at today's corporate power structure suggests this new freedom. Microsoft runs its global operations from a suburb of Seattle. Wal-Mart operates from rural Bentonville, Ark. Nationsbank is swallowing BankAmerica, based in San Francisco, and taking its name but maintaining the headquarters of the merged banks in the former backwater of Charlotte, N.C.
The relatively strong cohesion of the new business elites makes their cities even more effective as competitors. A large part of Seattle's success stems from civic traditions of boosterism among its big players, particularly the so-called B.M.W. connection -- Boeing, Microsoft and Weyerhaeuser. "We have a great sense of common purpose that holds us together here," said Pat Davis, a Seattle port commissioner. "Loyalty to Seattle is the core of that tradition."
Such civic loyalties have shaped the patterns of urban growth throughout American history. New York's rise to national pre-eminence owed much to the vitality of its mercantile and financial top echelon --- Astors, Vanderbilts, Morgans and Rockefellers -- which proved to be more dynamic than its relatively complacent rivals in Philadelphia and Boston.
Los Angeles was virtually willed into creation through the ambition of business leaders like Henry Huntington, the railroad giant. They pushed development of the city's water, transportation and port systems.
Several newer factors make such elites increasingly crucial to the health of big cities today. In the 1960's and 70's, it seemed plausible to some urban politicians and activists to rely on Washington or state government rather than to appease the local business establishment. But this has changed drastically since the 80's. In New York City, for example, the percentage of the budget covered by state and Federal transfers dropped from 37 percent in 1982 to roughly 30 percent by 1990 and has moved little since.
At the same time, cities have also lost much political leverage. Since the 1950's, for example, Chicago's share of the Illinois electorate has dropped from 40 percent to well under 30 percent; Detroit's share of Michigan's voters has plunged from 30 percent to barely 10 percent.
Cities have also been losing the battle for the hearts, minds and wallets of middle-class citizens and businesses. Despite a turnaround in crime statistics and other social indicators, big-city job growth continues to lag. From 1993 to 1997, when the nation added 9 percent more jobs, job gains in Los Angeles were roughly half that figure, while New York's have barely been one-third.
IN the new business centers, companies have sunk their roots deeply into their home ground, calling on senior executives to perform a variety of philanthropic and entrepreneurial roles.
Paul Allen, the billionaire who was the co-founder of Microsoft, has financed not only a host of small technology firms but also the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League along with a small film production company and a restoration of the downtown's old Union Station.
In the sprawling region stretching north from San Jose, Calif., and east to Fremont, relatively young technology businesses, organized around Joint Venture: Silicon Valley, an economic development group, have become the dominant voice in an area ruled a generation ago by land developers and farm interests.
And Atlanta's ability to marry its predominately black political class with the city's business leadership has been crucial to promoting its image as a progressive yet business-friendly center, helping it land the 1996 Summer Olympics.
Business elites in many larger urban areas often appear only peripherally connected to their cities' political structures. New York's growing reliance on Wall Street has placed the city's fate increasingly in the hands of an industry tied intimately to global markets and short-term profits originating elsewhere. "What do the people on Wall Street care about New York?" asks Edward N. Costikyan, a former Manhattan Democratic leader who is now a lawyer in midtown. "They don't use the schools or go to the outer boroughs."
However welcome the current Wall Street boom may be, people like Mr. Costikyan and Walter B. Wriston, the former chief executive of Citicorp, warn that the loss of corporate headquarters, along with the exodus of locally anchored manufacturing and service businesses, could leave New York rudderless in a future storm.
"When we had the fiscal crisis in the 1970's, I could schlep the city's paper to corporations who were still here and willing to do something for the city," Mr. Wriston recalled recently. "If it happens again, who would be there to do anything? J. C. Penney is now in Plano, Tex. Mobil is in Virginia."
Of course, New York, like other cities, is hardly without its boosters, notably in the real estate industry, whose commitment to the city is engraved in glass, cement and steel. Since the mid-70's, Manhattan real estate interests have been at the core of the varied attempts to resuscitate the city's economy and image.
But even the landlords' bond grows more tenuous as office towers are sold to publicly held real estate investment trusts with headquarters elsewhere. And over time, cities must be able to build a broader base of civic leadership, bringing in entrepreneurs from emerging industries like multimedia, entertainment, specialty manufacturing and international trade as well as increasingly important immigrant-owned enterprises.
In Los Angeles, such efforts to revive and to diversify civic elites face similar challenges. Like Wall Street in New York, the entertainment complex is the economic powerhouse of the city but has a tradition of noninvolvement and even disdain for the hometown.
"The movie and television business has always been a fairly tight-knit industry that's basically involved with itself and selling to the world," said Dennis C. Stanfill, former chief executive of 20th Century Fox. "You do your work locally, but you think nationally and internationally."
To date, Mayor Riordan has been only modestly successful in rallying the new entertainment moguls to the city's cause. The Mayor, along with Mr. Bowlin of ARCO and Eli Broad, chairman of SunAmerica, have recently organized Los Angeles Business Advisors, a group of about two dozen top corporate executives. But they have failed to recruit a single prominent figure from entertainment or from other growth sectors like toys and fashion.
Yet, the Mayor's efforts have not been entirely wasted. The stalled downtown concert center, Disney Hall, finally has the needed financial commitments. Other improvements include a downtown sports arena and a new Roman Catholic cathedral to replace one dating from the late 19th century that was damaged in the 1994 earthquake.
"If you rally the key people, anything is possible," Mr. Riordan explained bluntly. "If you can't, it's kind of a lost cause."

HEADLINE: Wanted: Alternate Route

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
IT'S a Wednesday morning in April 2015, and you're late for work.
Because you're carpooling with a neighbor, you are allowed on the Turnpike, where single-occupant vehicles have been banned for years. But you and Kim Soo have agreed that only in emergencies will you pay the triple toll charged during peak hours. So when you punch your destination into the dashboard computer, you order a no-toll route. 
 A map flashes onto the screen. Ah, they finally finished that paving project, so you'll be able to save a couple of minutes taking the back streets of your suburban neighborhood, steering clear of the crowded school and shopping zones. Then you head onto what used to be a freeway and is now a broad boulevard with eight lanes in each direction, lined with trees, stores, sidewalks and bus stops.
Suddenly, an overhead sign flashes, warning of delays ahead, and the computer lists time estimates for five alternative routes, including a train link. The slowest route is on side streets, 49 minutes; the fastest is the Turnpike, 16.
"Let's splurge," Kim Soo says, and you zip up a ramp, not even slowing as the electronic reader scans your windshield card. You switch to autodrive and settle back over the paper while the car drives itself to the office at a comfortable, and perfectly legal, 80 miles per hour. Hey, if it weren't legal, you could get a $500 ticket!
At your exit, E-Z Pass charges your account $15, and you resume manual control for the last two blocks to the office.
This scenario is an amalgam of some of the ideas of urban planners and traffic engineers as they quietly consider the issues that lie beneath the vigorous debates roiling New Jersey over everything from new rail lines, road quality, speed limits, car insurance, and the gasoline tax to perpetuating the Federal transportation funding process known as ISTEA.
The bedrock of those myriad battles is a system of more than 34,000 miles of roads, on which, in transit parlance, a staggering 60 billion vehicle miles are traveled every year. It is a system of Indian paths and colonial roads that has evolved into an enormous complex of state and interstate highways, a system so strained that it is no longer capable of even pretending to be all things to all drivers.
More and wider roads are constantly being proposed to allow for more freight, more commuting, more getting around of all kinds. For instance, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority is hoping to build an east-west Route 92 across southern Middlesex County, saying it will ease traffic on Route 1. And along the Hudson shore, mayors are proposing a roadway through the abandoned railway tunnels known as the Bergen Arches to allow local traffic to bypass the jammed routes to the Lincoln and Holland tunnels.
But such proposals tend to draw bitter opposition from residents and environmentalists. Even some proponents of new highways believe they offer only a partial solution in a state that is already one of the most paved in the country, with 4.5 miles of roadway for every square mile of land.
"Generally speaking, there is a widespread recognition that we can't build ourselves out of congestion," said Joel Weiner, the executive director of the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority. "You can't pave over everything."
Instead, urban planners and transit experts are looking at ways to alter as well as accommodate traffic, including technology like E-Z Pass, smart mass transit systems that give riders up-to-the-minute E.T.A.'s, and other innovations like the on-demand bus service planned for Bergen County.
And the experts are looking beyond traffic-control technology to the demographic and land-use patterns that create traffic in the first place. As one traffic engineer, Walter Kulash, puts it: "We've engineered the highways all we can. Now we have to engineer travel patterns."
 
Over the Centuries, A Reliance on Highways
To say that more roads can't solve New Jersey's traffic problems goes against a tradition with roots far deeper than the 1950's faith in progress that brought the Interstate system. Even in the colonial era, New Jersey's roads were serving as crucial connectors on the Eastern Seaboard. The colonial Post Road that ran across the state's waist, the 90-mile stretch between the Hudson River and Trenton, was one of the most heavily used highways in the Western Hemisphere. News of the shots fired at Lexington came overland through New Jersey to get to Philadelphia; people, trade and jobs collected along the route, which roughly followed the Indian Assanpink Trail and is now the infamous Route 1.
For much of the state's nearly 400 years of recorded history, road building and maintenance was the job of local towns or the private companies that built toll roads. Then in 1890, partly in response to pressure from fans of the newly invented bicycle, New Jersey became the first state in the nation to dedicate state funds to roads.
The automobile, which arrived shortly thereafter, rapidly increased public demand for a road system, and in 1909 the state created a highway commission. In 1917, the commission laid out a network of 15 state routes. (Many of those routes remain, but the numbering system was changed repeatedly, giving historians as many headaches as drivers.)
And the years since have seen superhighway after turnpike after expressway after freeway tear across the state. Many tried to bypass crowded cities and were too successful, attracting development that sapped vitality from urban centers.
The state's roadways are considered so historically rich that two (the Old Mine Road, in Sussex and Warren counties, and River Road, in Middlesex) are already on the National Register of Historic Places. The Pulaski Skyway, a 13-mile feat of 1930's engineering spanning the lowlands between Jersey City and Newark, has met all the criteria for designation, and preservationists are beginning to argue for the same protection for Routes 1 and 9.
Can the age of highway building really be over?
For sometimes contradictory reasons, transit experts say yes. For John J. Haley Jr., the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Transportation, it's simply no longer economically or politically feasible to add more than a few new roads. Maintaining and operating what already exists eats three-quarters of his $1.85 billion annual budget. Hundreds of jam-causing projects are underway at any given time. No fewer than 16 major projects are planned for this year.
Land and construction costs are prohibitive, it is difficult to get approval for any project that doesn't reduce pollution, and too much is known about the cost to communities when road projects rip through.
"The days of drawing a line on a map and simply pushing through like Robert Moses and then cleaning up after the elephants, those days are over," Mr. Haley said.
Others say the reason is that roadways operate like a vacuum, drawing as many cars as will fit. "The roadways become so much of an attraction, and then the traffic chokes the very thing that attracted it," said Alan Pisarski, a researcher in travel behavior and the author of "Commuting in America" (Urban Land Institute, 1996). "Transportation systems seem to have the seeds of their own destruction."
And in a state that is trying to rebuild its cities, more highways simply encourage the very sprawl Governor Whitman has pledged to curtail. Anton Nelessen, a Trenton-based transportation consultant who is helping Milwaukee replace a freeway with a boulevard, sees highway-building as simply outmoded Depression-era thinking.
"The idea was, if you build more highways, buy more cars, buy more gas, lighten up on regulations, it's good economically for the country," he said. "And it was. Then."
 
The Interactive Highway And the Dial-a-Bus
The first wave of ideas on solving traffic problems with highway management instead of new construction came in the late 80's, with the development of the intelligent transportation system, or I.T.S., a kind of interactive roadway. The concept was created to satisfy the Federal Clean Air Act, which mandated significant reductions in exhaust emissions when it was passed in 1970, at a time of enormous traffic increases caused by baby-boomers and increasing numbers of women entering the workforce.
In New Jersey, I.T.S. is manifest in the New Jersey Turnpike's radio broadcasts, the huge electronic signs that flash real-time traffic updates, the computer-controlled traffic lights along Route 18 that allow synchronization and the video cameras along accident-prone lengths of Route 1 that enable rapid accident clearing. It includes E-Z Pass, the electronic toll collectors installed at the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels and the George Washington Bridge. Commissioner Haley says the system will be installed on all of the state's toll roads within two years.
The key to 21st-century highway management is integrating all these tools, a unification already underway in places like San Antonio, Tex., and Southern California, according to Christine Johnson, the director of the I.T.S. program for the United States Department of Transportation.
"You have automatic vehicle location, using the Global Positioning System, that monitors where vehicles are," she said. "That can tell you that the bus is eight minutes away. You can link New Jersey Transit and computerized traffic-light controls and highway controls and emergency response."
Some of this information can be beamed directly into people's cars, allowing drivers to make better-informed choices. In Europe, she said, traffic conditions and route data are sent into individual cars in the language of the driver's choice.
But traffic management, which raises questions about exactly who will manage the managers, is not the only focus. There are also projects underway, or under consideration, to encourage people to get out of their cars.
New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the nation, with more than 1,000 people per square mile, but it is also the most densely vehicled state, with almost 790 per square mile. Of a residential total of about 7.7 million people, there are 5.7 million licensed drivers. There are even more registered cars: 5.9 million. Combined with the numbers is a rapidly growing commuting pattern, suburb to suburb, that is unservable by traditional mass transit.
"It used to be that our system focused on getting people into Newark, New York and Philadelphia," Mr. Haley said. "But now the people and the jobs are moving up and down within the state. And we're focusing on moving people better within the state."
The Hudson-Bergen light rail project, running from Bayonne to Ridgefield Park, links neighborhoods, railroads, highways and ferries; the stretch from Bayonne to Hoboken is expected to be operational by 2000, and the remainder by 2002. Mr. Haley said that another light rail plan for southern New Jersey was in design, and that he expected it go out for bid by the fall and be operational at about the same time as the Hudson-Bergen line. And, he said, five more light rail plans were under consideration.
These projects are in addition to rail improvements already approved, including the Secaucus transfer, which will allow commuters on the old Erie-Lackawanna lines from Bergen, Passaic and Rockland counties to link to Amtrak's Northeast Corridor rather than descending to Hoboken for connections. The Montclair connection, linking New Jersey Transit's Boonton line to its Montclair branch, will allow thousands of commuters to travel directly into midtown Manhattan without having to transfer at Hoboken.
Over the next few years, Mr. Haley said, the state's bus system, which already carries 143 million fares a year, will be rerouted through suburban points, and zippy little vans, not ponderous buses, will service those routes.
And a cutting-edge, on-demand bus service that planners believe may be able to pay for itself is being developed in Bergen County, with a pilot program set to go into effect when the light rail opens. Chester Mattson, the county's director of planning, described the pilot program as a system of vans that are tracked via Global Positioning System, which can pinpoint the location of any transmitter-equipped object on the planet. The vans, dispatched by a computer that calculates which is most available, will respond to specific calls of customers who want to be picked up and dropped off at any of hundreds of stops in more than a dozen municipalities in the county's dense, central core. The design limits a vanload to three passengers, so that riders, who will pay about $3 for a ride, will not face the delays caused by endless stops.
The program will kick off with no fewer than 40 vans. "The idea is to have a service large enough to respond to enough clients to succeed when it starts, rather than the usual governmental approach of putting one van out there and seeing if anybody uses it," Mr. Mattson said.
Commissioner Haley said that employers are being encouraged to offer a "cash-out parking plan" to their workers. In this plan, companies charge employees for parking, but also pay every worker the exact amount it costs to park every day. Those employees who find some other way to work can simply pocket the extra. The employer may be able to get tax incentives to make the plan worthwhile.
And after E-Z Pass is ubiquitous, Mr. Haley said, "congestion pricing" will go into effect, in which higher tolls at peak periods would be balanced by lower fares on mass transit.
Motorists groups have already promised to fight any such measure, and it is likely to be a sizzling political potato, but the Commissioner was adamant in his support for it.
"The single biggest complaint I get is about trucks on local roads," Mr. Haley said. "We want to encourage trucks to use the Turnpike and the interstates. We can do that with congestion pricing."
There are other possibilities. The H.O.V. lanes meant for high-occupancy vehicles on I-287 and I-80 are extremely unpopular among drivers, and experts question their utility. They could be transformed into H.O./ T. lanes, meaning high-occupancy or toll. The system, being tested in California, gives drivers of single-occupant vehicles the option of paying for the right to drive in the reserved lane.
 
Freight Clogs Roads In a Major Port State
Moving people off the roads is one thing; another key to unclogging traffic is diverting freight. Every year, about a tenth of the nation's cargo spends some time on New Jersey's roads. That's 850 million tons of cargo, and the state D.O.T. says that 59 percent of it is just passing through.
Later this year, the long-awaited division of the old Conrail lines between CSX and Norfolk Southern is expected to be accomplished. Both lines will operate in New Jersey, and both have promised to expand service. Price wars, experts say, are inevitable.
That could help New Jersey's highway problems considerably -- unless, as many economists promise, world trade doubles by 2010, and, as politicians promise, Port Newark and Port Elizabeth retain or increase their central role in the shipping industry. That much more cargo could simply clog the rail system as well as the highway system. Proposals for new rail tunnels under New York Harbor are already under consideration.
The clear message is, something's got to give. And there are scare stories out there. Angus Kress Gillespie, who wrote "Looking for America on the New Jersey Turnpike" (Rutgers University Press, 1989), notes that Tokyo requires drivers to prove they have off-road parking spaces before they are allowed to buy cars. Steve Carrellas, a New Jersey spokesman for the National Motorists Association, says that Singapore doesn't just ticket cars for minor infractions, it tows them away.
"No one thing is going to solve New Jersey's transportation problems," said Barbara Lawrence, the executive director of New Jersey Future, a non-profit organization that encourages compliance with the state's regional plan. "Can't you see the headline? 'Magic Bullet Found!' "

Crackdown on Cheating

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
Fifty people are accused of collecting unemployment checks while employed, stealing anywhere from $1,316 to $8,475 each from the State Department of Labor, Commissioner James J. McGowan and District Attorney Jeanine Pirro of Westchester reported last week. All are charged with fourth-degree grand larceny, a felony punishable by up to four years in jail.
The charges cover reported thefts from September 1994 to December 1996 and are the result of an investigation by the District Attorney's Office and the Office of the Inspector General of the State Labor Department. Commissioner McGowan said that the policy of his department is to "aggressively pursue anyone who cheats the system." 
 The state and county agencies found the suspects by comparing computer lists of people collecting unemployment benefits with those paying income taxes.
Since the announcement, the Department of Labor reported that it had received many phone calls from people wanting to avoid prosecution. The focus of the crackdown, Mrs. Pirro said, was not only to find people defrauding the government but also to spur "others into voluntarily refunding" payments they were not entitled to.

With Promises, Promises, NATO Moves the East

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
IN the United States, the question of whether to expand NATO eastward has been debated only in fits and starts, and then most passionately on the issues of how the Russians feel about it and whether it might cost too much.
But another question figures in the debate too: What effect has the lure of NATO membership had on the way the proposed new members -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- govern themselves and behave toward their neighbors after nearly half a century under Communism? 
 No one of these questions alone will decide the debate, which the Senate is scheduled to resume on Monday. Opponents of the Clinton Administration's proposal to expand NATO will doubtless emphasize the questions of money, Russia, and how many other new members this precedent will open the door to.
Still, it is on the question of how the prospective members are behaving that some of the hardest evidence is in, and it adds up to this:
 
Agreement on a Goal
While all three have a way to go on meeting Western standards of democratic rule and stable market economies, no issue has dominated the internal political behavior of the three Central European countries as much as the aspiration to belong to the Western security alliance.
In all three prospective new members, former Communists and anti-Communists alike have agreed on NATO membership as a national goal, and as a result all have tried with varying degrees of sincerity to meet the alliance's broad requirements of democratic rule and free enterprise.
In other words, the promise of inclusion in NATO has helped the cause of moderate government during a tough period of economic and political transition. And there is little doubt, analysts say, that trying to lay the political groundwork to satisfy NATO has left Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic better positioned for sustained economic growth.
Such growth, in turn, could also help these countries join the European Union -- another goal they share, and one they are pursuing in negotiations that opened in Brussels last month and that promise to be tough.
One lesson clearly taken to heart by Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary was the elimination of Slovakia from the list of potential NATO members after its Prime Minister, Vladimir Meciar, became increasingly authoritarian. Similarly, the European Union has cited Slovakia's lack of democratic progress as a reason for its exclusion from the first round of the economic union's eastward expansion.
The new American Ambassador to Poland, Daniel Fried, who helped formulate the arguments for expanding NATO when he worked at the National Security Council before coming to Warsaw last fall, likes to point to the way the three countries have behaved toward each other. "When Poland and Hungary became more confident of their NATO membership," he said, "they increased their outreach to their neighbors -- Hungary to Romania, and Poland to Lithuania."
A decade ago, when the Soviet hold on Eastern Europe was evaporating, one worry for NATO was that old national resentments would resurface in the form of border disputes and mistreatment of minorities, creating instability in the region. So when NATO decided it might enlarge, it made it clear that aspirants to membership had to avoid that kind of thing.
Now Hungary and Romania have signed a treaty guaranteeing each other's borders and respecting the right of the large Hungarian minority in Romania. And tense relations between Poland and Lithuania have improved to the point that they have created a joint peacekeeping battalion.
Another benchmark set down by NATO, and in particular by the Pentagon, was that the military in new members had to be subordinate to civilian control. This was a prickly subject in Poland, where former President Lech Walesa wanted to keep broad authority in the hands of his generals. Only since the defeat of Mr. Walesa in elections in 1995 and the adoption of a new Constitution calling for subordination of the general staff to the Minister of Defense has the strong political influence of the Polish military brass diminished.
 
Changes in the Brass
Last year, to the relief of the Pentagon, President Kwasniewski fired Gen. Tadeusz Wilecki, a Walesa appointee, who had shown open contempt for the civilians at the defense ministry.
Now Henry Szumski, a younger general who has United Nations field experience, is at the top, and Janusz Onyszkiewicz, an ardent proponent of civilian control of the military, is defense minister. NATO specialists say they are satisfied that the Polish military is on the right track, but another challenge remains: to clear out many of the Communist-era holdovers in the military intelligence service.
In another example of changing attitudes, the Hungarian Government passed over Soviet-trained generals for the post of chief of the general staff and reached down to the third level of the military hierarchy for Lieut. Gen. Ferenc Vegh, an English-speaking graduate of the United States Army War College. Now 7 of the top 10 generals in Hungary are Western trained.
Last month. the Czechs appointed a new chief of the general staff, Jiri Sedivy, 45, who stands out for his experience as a battalion commander in Bosnia and for his choice of military heroes: Eisenhower, Patton and Schwarzkopf.
Along with elevating military officers who think like those in the West, the three countries have been encouraged by NATO to get serious about parliamentary oversight committees. On this point, they still have a long way to go; the defense committee in the lower house of Poland's Parliament has no staff, and the enthusiastic members of Hungary's parliamentary defense committee have little background in military affairs.
No one would argue that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are mature democracies with classic capitalist economies. Progress toward the rule of law and the protection of minority rights is far from perfect. In all three countries, the judicial systems are fragile and financial corruption widespread. There are still huge disparities in terms of wealth between the European Union and its prospective new eastern members.
But Marek Matraszek, the Warsaw director of CEC Government Relations, a political consulting firm that has worked on NATO related issues, believes that without the prospect of membership in NATO, Poland might easily have fallen under the sway of nationalist and populist politicians. Now it seems reasonable to believe that Poland, a land with 40 million people and a bounding economy growing at six percent a year, may reach its goal of being a middle-size Western European power within the next decade.
"The promise of NATO has defused destabilizing forces from the left and right." Mr. Matraszek said. "If NATO had not been offered, Poland could have been in a disastrous situation, externally and internally."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Building Momentum With Foreign Stocks

BYLINE: By ARLENE WEINTRAUB 

 BODY:
IT would be difficult to find two more cosmopolitan stock pickers. Henrik Strabo, 38, a native of Copenhagen, moved to the United States as a teen-ager to attend the University of Washington and decided to stick around. Mark S. Kopinski, 41, meanwhile, took a different route, leaving his home outside of Chicago in 1973 to become a Rotary exchange student in Kariya, Japan. He liked it so much that he returned later, living in Tokyo for 10 years.
But ask these globe-trotters how their American Century-Twentieth Century International Discovery fund achieved its white-hot performance, and the impassioned response has nothing to with their worldliness. Instead, they cite their absolute belief in the power of momentum investing: the much-criticized practice of piling into stocks whose profits are on the upswing. 
 "Whether it's a software company or a steel company or a consumer company or an auto company, we're looking for earnings growth," the usually mild-mannered Mr. Strabo said as he pounded the table. "We firmly believe that there's nothing like a couple of good earnings announcements to get these stocks to move."
It is likely that Mr. Strabo and Mr. Kopinski are making believers out of their investors. For the three years ended April 17, the fund had an annualized return of 30.1 percent, compared with just 13.5 percent for its peer group of foreign stock funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago.
The momentum label, of course, is seldom meant as a compliment. First, critics complain that by paying scant heed to macroeconomic conditions, a momentum fund cannot pick a turnaround situation in the offing. But Mr. Kopinski says he believes that the fund does just that by looking at what he calls "micro-industry" statistics like department store sales and machinery orders.
Then there is the issue of wild volatility, which critics say is characteristic of the momentum style of investing. But Mr. Kopinski denies that his fund is more risky than rival offerings. According to Morningstar, the fund's three-year standard deviation, a common measure of volatility, is 14.5, just slightly greater than that of its peers.
By its nature, Discovery's momentum-based, bottoms-up approach means investing in businesses that have a strong record of earnings growth. If they were picking United States stocks, that would usually mean relying on huge amounts of computer-generated information -- sales, inventory and other data -- to help find companies with accelerating profits.
But finding such stocks abroad, where company numbers can be scarce and unreliable, is labor intensive. "We don't spend a lot of time building massive spreadsheets and all that," Mr. Strabo said. "What we're more concerned about is understanding the business."
The two managers also demand proof that companies have something special that guarantees continued profit momentum -- a dominant market share, perhaps, or a unique niche. To that end, Mr. Strabo, Mr. Kopinski and their team of six analysts each spend several weeks a year visiting foreign companies. In addition, executives from a company a day, on average, drop by the fund's headquarters in Greenwich, Conn. or meet with executives in New York.
"When we sit down with management we like to find out what really excites them about the business, what gets them up in the morning, and where the earnings growth is coming from," Mr. Strabo said.
In the fund's tiny, nondescript office, 13 languages are spoken, and the managers encourage their six analysts to take company-paid language courses in their spare time. "You don't need the language to pick stocks," Mr. Strabo said. "But when you learn a language, you get a little bit of understanding of how the person sitting on the other side of the table thinks."
Each day, the staff pours over dozens of foreign publications, from Nihon Keizai Shimbun of Tokyo to Le Monde of Paris to Dagens Industri of Denmark, searching for news that may not turn up elsewhere.
While other international funds often balance their portfolios based on which countries are strongest economically, Discovery's managers would rather spend their time sifting through earnings reports.
This intense focus on individual companies, they say, lets them spot trouble before many top-down strategists do. A recent example was the Asian market plunge last year.
"I think a lot of people were positive about Asia because they fell into what I call the G.D.P.-growth trap," Mr. Strabo said. "They were saying, 'these economies are growing 6 percent a year or more so it has to be a great place to invest,' which is simply not true. What we saw in Asia some time ago was margins coming under pressure and a very consistent deceleration in earnings."
The fund had 18.5 percent of its assets in Asia at the beginning of 1997. By September, as the Asian economies started their meltdown, Discovery had whittled that down to just 6.1 percent, having shifted much of its money to Europe, where it now invests 80 percent of assets.
Roughly 13 percent of the fund's holdings are in the Netherlands, 12 percent in Britain, 7 percent in Switzerland, 6 percent each in Germany and Sweden, and 5 percent each in France and Finland. Nine percent of the assets are in Canada.
PRIVATIZATION and the pending introduction of a common currency in Europe have bolstered growth in several industries, notably information technology.
"We're seeing the telcos, utilities, airports and so forth being privatized, and as that process goes through, those companies will need to become more efficient, which means they'll be using more technology," Mr. Strabo said. "Also the common currency requires a lot of preparation. That creates huge opportunities for technology companies."
One company that has benefited from the technology boom is Tieto of Finland, which builds and installs computer networks. "They have a dominant market position in Finland and the underlying market is growing rapidly, so they're basically in a sweet spot," Mr. Strabo said. Last year, earnings grew 55 percent, and consensus estimates predict further profit growth of 24 percent this year. The fund began building its position in 1996 at an average price of 269.67 Finnish markkaa; the stock now trades at 1,050 markkaa.
The only major factor limiting Tieto's growth prospects, Mr. Strabo says, is a challenge facing all information technology companies: finding enough qualified personnel.
Another Discovery holding, Parity P.L.C. of Britain, has stepped in to fill that demand. The company provides permanent and temporary technology professionals to businesses across Europe. In 1997, earnings jumped 32 percent, and analysts expect 30 percent profit growth this year. The fund acquired its shares at an average cost of 3.51 starting in mid-1996; they now trade at 7.79.
Parity is benefiting not only from the high demand for technology workers but also from an increasing acceptance of flexible labor throughout Europe. "In some countries until very recently, believe it or not, using a temporary work force was not allowed," Mr. Strabo said. "As places like Germany introduce flexible labor, we see tremendous growth opportunities for Parity."
Labor-related changes in Europe have also fueled earnings growth in the financial services sector. Governments have begun privatizing pension systems, which has increased demand for retirement plans based on mutual funds and sold by companies like Marschollek, Lautenschlaeger und Partner A.G. of Germany, known as M.L.P.
The company, Discovery's largest holding at 3.3 percent of the portfolio as of February, recently added funds to its menu of products. Selling them, Mr. Strabo predicted, should not be difficult. M.L.P., which started as an insurance company, has a highly effective sales technique: recruiting doctors, lawyers and other professionals out of graduate schools and then training them to sell financial products to their former classmates.
The company's profits are predicted to jump 30 percent this year. "M.L.P. will continue to expand into profitable products, and they'll be able to sell these products because they already have a very high-quality, low-risk, wealthy client base," Mr. Strabo said.
Mr. Strabo started acquiring M.L.P. shares shortly after the fund's inception in April 1994. The stock has risen fourfold over the fund's average purchase price, to 683 German marks.
Mr. Strabo and Mr. Kopinski have also met with momentum-driven success with another offering; they are co-managers of a large-cap fund, American Century-Twentieth Century International Growth. It returned 23.4 percent, annualized, for the three years ended April 17, compared with 13.5 percent for its peers, according to Morningstar.
International Discovery's neat sidestepping of the Asian crisis did not help Mr. Kopinski in his latest fund project, however. Last September, American Century started the American Century-Twentieth Century Emerging Markets fund, of which Mr. Kopinski and Michael Donnelly are co-managers. The new fund was hit hard -- losing 17 percent in its first two months.
"We had a lot invested in Hong Kong and Singapore, which we thought would be relatively safe havens, but they didn't escape the carnage," he said.
As for Discovery, Mr. Kopinski thinks the potential remains strong. "Look at how the depth of the U.S. market has changed over the last 15 years," he said. "Europe is in a similar growth stage now. The opportunities are just immense."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT: FOCUS ON BANKING;
That Layered Look In Cash-Advance Fees

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
WITH credit-card competition so fierce -- when was the last week you weren't solicited? -- you might assume that it wouldn't much matter which card you pull from your wallet for a cash advance.
But down this path may lie a hard and costly lesson. An inattentive borrower on a business trip, for example, might wind up paying an effective interest rate of 40 percent or more when fees for processing and automatic teller machines are piled on top of interest charges. 
 "The cash-advance business is a tremendous service" to consumers, said Spencer Nilson, who publishes The Nilson Report, an credit-card industry newsletter in Oxnard, Calif. But, advising close scrutiny, he warned, "they can charge you anything they want."
The feature clearly fills a need for many consumers. According to the American Bankers Association, card holders who draw cash advances from accounts at the largest issuers average $287 for each use on standard cards and $520 on gold cards. But charges vary sharply. A Federal Reserve compilation of credit-card terms, filed by banks on a voluntary basis, points up some of the extremes.
Star Bank in Cincinnati, for example, charges a minimum of $20 for cash advances, which are often repaid in days or weeks, while the Metropolitan Savings Bank in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, has neither a percentage nor dollar-minimum fee on its Mastercard; it makes its money solely from the 13.9 percent interest it charges on cash advances.
Other special terms abound, such as at Dial Bank in South Dakota, where Visa fees vary according to the state in which the transaction occurs.
"Pricing does tend to vary a great deal," said Robert Stock, senior vice president for credit products at Visa U.S.A.. "Individual banks are entirely on their own."
Not surprisingly, banks with higher transaction fees tend to offer lower rates. But Wells Fargo charges an annual interest rate of 20.05 percent -- in addition to a cash-advance transaction fee that is 4 percent of the amount borrowed.
"If you look at 10 different cards, you'd probably see 10 different configurations of how they handle cash advances in terms of the transaction, fee, how the interest is accrued and what that interest rate actually is," said R. Douglas Rozman, a spokesman for Mastercard.
Smart use of cash advances involves several factors beyond tracking the varying interest rates. It's important to determine, for example, just how a bank allocates repayments on accounts in which purchases and cash advances are intermingled.
INTEREST rates are often higher for advances than for purchases, although the rates are identical at some banks. Still, interest on advances is almost always levied for each day of borrowing, with no grace period; thus, if you are not fully repaying the amount on your monthly statement, it matters how your partial payment is credited when your statement includes both advances and purchases.
Citibank assigns partial payments equally to advances and purchases. Household International sets them first against a card holder's lowest-rate obligations; AT&T Universal applies them to finance charges and phone calls first; Chase Manhattan allocates payments at its "discretion." The lesson is not to mix advances and purchases on a card that treats them differently.
One especially expensive type of advance can be for "quasi-cash," which includes money orders, travelers checks, lottery tickets, foreign currency, race-track tickets and casino chips. Bank of America, for example, charges a 4 percent transaction fee for quasi-cash, compared with 2.5 percent for an ordinary advance.
Cash-advance users can often do better at small and medium-sized institutions. There, the American Bankers Association says, the transaction fees average 2 percent, versus 2.5 percent for the giants.

CHRISTOPHER HEIB rises before dawn to get to his day job as a power line worker for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. But just as important to him is his second shift -- taking care of his sons Rudy, 6, and Thomas, a newborn.
Like many other men his age, Mr. Heib, 33, of Long Beach, Calif., regrets having spent so little time with his father growing up. But unlike fathers who hold professional or managerial jobs that occupy them 50 or more hours a week, Mr. Heib's job allows him the flexibility to be the father he wishes he'd had. 
 "I like coming home to take care of the kids," said Mr. Heib, who takes over at 4:30 P.M. when his wife, Sandra, 31, leaves for her job as a 911 dispatcher for the Los Angeles Police Department. Her shift runs from 6 P.M. to 2:30 A.M. "I feel I can talk to my son. He's closer to me than I was to my parents. I can come home every single night and be with him."
The number of children being cared for by their fathers is "the best-kept secret in American child care," said James Levine, author of "Working Fathers" (Addison-Wesley, 1997) and director of the Fatherhood Project at the Families and Work Institute in New York.
Moreover, it is not upper-middle-class professionals or corporate managers who are leading the trend toward more-involved fatherhood; it is lower-paid, blue-collar men. "Most people think of the stereotype of Mr. Mom, the guy who quits his job and stays home," said Mr. Levine, "when in fact most guys who are primary care givers are in families with two working parents on split shifts."
Fathers in municipal and service jobs -- firefighters, police officers and maintenance workers, for example, -- are twice as likely as those in professional, managerial or technical jobs to care for their children while their wives are working, according to Census Bureau data.
In 1993, among all married fathers of children younger than age 5, some 1.6 million -- about 25 percent -- cared for their children while the mothers worked. In service occupations, the numbers were far higher: 42 percent of fathers cared for preschoolers, the Census Bureau found, versus 20 percent of fathers with professional or managerial jobs.
Earlier this month, the Families and Work Institute released a study that said even working men who are not the primary providers of care for their children were spending significantly more time with their children than they did 20 years ago.
The National Study of the Changing Work Force, a survey of more than 3,500 working men and women in 1997, found that fathers spent an average of 2.3 hours each workday with their children, a half-hour more than the average reported by a Department of Labor survey in 1977.
Not surprisingly, economic factors are a primary reason that men are spending more time caring for their young children. Most families now need two incomes to pay the bills -- and child care is increasingly expensive.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the largest projected job growth through 2006 will be in 10 occupations including cashiers, sales clerks, truck drivers and teacher's aides. Many of these jobs have relatively low wages and require night and weekend shifts.
That can mean a double whammy: younger workers with less seniority are more likely to have these shifts, and these same workers are also more likely than older colleagues to be raising young children.
"We think of dual-earner couples both going away in the morning, coming home in the evening and leaving the kids in day care," said Harriet Presser, a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland who studies the work schedules of American families. "But in a big proportion of these couples, especially those with young children, you get this split-shift arrangement. One works days; one works evenings. That's characteristic of one-fourth of all two-earner couples in the U.S., and one-third of all two-earner couples with children under 5."
Not all the forces driving the "daddy shift" are economic. Some two-income families do not believe in outside child care, and some men simply see their work at home as part of being a father.
"The expectation of young first-time marrying couples now is that fathers and mothers will co-parent," said Kyle Pruett, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University's Child Study Center who has studied the stay-at-home father's role in child development. "That was not the assumption their mothers and fathers made."
BEYOND savings on child care, such arrangements offer intangible benefits. There is ample research to indicate that having a father around to make dinner, play in the park and read stories is a plus for children.
But for couples, the arrangements can mean additional strains.
Alan Bamdas, 32, of West Orange, N.J., works a schedule of 24 hours on, 72 hours off, as a firefighter in Maplewood, N.J. His wife, Kimberley, 31, a police dispatcher for Maplewood, works a 7 A.M. to 3 P.M. shift. The two have complex arrangements for their 3-year-old son, Harrison, who attends preschool three days a week and sometimes goes to his grandparents when both parents are at work.
Scheduling, Mrs. Bamdas said, is a horror. "We can't do anything, including going to the movies, without opening our date books," she said. "We don't have good quality time together as husband and wife."
While they both accept this arrangement now, the difficulties have made them put off thoughts of having a second child. Switching to part-time work would not provide enough income, Mrs. Bamdas said.
Jonathan Hunter, 35, of Aliso Viejo, Calif., knows the problem well. He works as a bell captain for the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel in Orange County, Calif., having quit a management job at another hotel company about a year ago after he realized that he could not tolerate spending 60 to 70 hours a week away from his wife, Racheal, and their two daughters, Chelsey, now 5, and Nicole, 2.
"Things were going by way too fast," said Mr. Hunter, who took a pay cut at his new job and now works from 3 to 11 P.M. so he can care for his daughters during the day. "I never saw them at all. It broke my heart, actually. The little one didn't seem to know who I was."
Mrs. Hunter also works at the Ritz-Carlton, as a market research analyst. Her shift runs from 7:30 A.M. to 4 P.M., and the couple use baby sitters to cover mid-afternoon hours.
The move has meant trade-offs, of course, and Mr. Hunter acknowledges some regrets. "It bothers me," he said. "People around me are constantly interviewing for other jobs, telling me about opportunities that come up. But when I think about my future, I look down and my future is running right around my feet."
And the demands of work and home take a toll, too. Lonnie Morgan, 31, a corrections officer in Madison, Wis., notes a lack of time for himself. He works a 3-to-11 P.M. shift and cares for his son Joshua, 4, and daughter, Moriah, 3, while his wife, Debora, 29, works as an office manager from 6:30 A.M. to 1:30 P.M.
"All I do is watch the kids and work," Mr. Morgan said. "There is no time to go out and play tennis or see friends." He has a new appreciation for all that child-rearing entails: "I understand how frustrating it can be. You're not just sitting around watching soap operas."
While child-care experts say more interaction with a father helps a young child, they caution against excluding other child care options.
"It's good for dads to get involved," said Stephanie Coontz, author of "The Way We Really Are: Coming to Terms with America's Changing Families" (Basic Books, 1997). "But to the extent a couple uses that as a substitute instead of a supplement to good child care, they may be putting a terrible strain on the marriage."
Studies have shown, Ms. Coontz said, that with "sensitive parents and adequate child care, there is no ill effect on the child."
"If you have good parenting and good child care, you have an extra advantage," she said. "Kids tend to have better social, emotional and cognitive skills.
"My advice to dads who want to do tag-team parenting is this: Stay involved, but don't kill yourself doing it."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
An Iron Merchant Presses Fast-Forward

BYLINE: By RICHARD KORMAN 

 BODY:
ELIZABETH CHASE looked out over the excavation site. Tyrannosaurus-sized shovels bit into fields of blasted stone dotted with giant-tired dump trucks. To an iron-mining novice like Ms. Chase, who was visiting the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in late February to research a 151-year-old company called Cleveland-Cliffs, the scene seemed to be moving in slow motion.
"Can't they speed up?" Ms. Chase, a research analyst for Schafer Capital Management, recalled thinking. 
 Iron mining is not the kind of business that brings Wall Street analysts to their feet. It is part of a mature industry -- steelmaking -- that has seen its share of pain. Unlike gold or even copper, iron is plentiful and the deposits are well known. The stocks of integrated steel mills, the major buyers of the metal, are often out of favor, and so are iron merchants like Cleveland-Cliffs.
Indeed, the company's stock trades at a stingy 11.65 times 1997 earnings per share -- about half as much as the average for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
But the company, which is based in Cleveland and had operating revenue of $439 million last year, says Wall Street has it all wrong. The company is "interested in new things, building where it can and expanding," said John S. Brinzo, the chief executive. In fact, a new plant is on the way and some major shareholders are convinced that earnings will rise sharply as a result. For several reasons, Cleveland-Cliffs may be shielded from the variations of price and demand that dog the steel industry. And, as its price-to-earnings ratio suggests, its stock has an advantage common to many that bore Wall Street: an attractive price.
As for the growth plans, Mr. Brinzo and his colleagues say they will use the strong balance sheet of Cleveland-Cliffs to finance growth. The company is moving to bolster overseas sales and is evaluating plans to build a plant to make pig iron, a high-grade metal. But as the centerpiece of its renewal program, the company is spending $74 million for its share of a technologically advanced processing plant in Trinidad and Tobago that will make bricks with a high iron content. The new plant could add as much as $1 a share to earnings in 1999.
High-iron products feed the appetite of steel mini-mills for competitively priced, high-quality feedstock. Currently, these mills make lower grades of steel, like structural steel for buildings; to break into higher-grade markets, like that for sheet steel used in large appliances, the mills need the kind of bricks that Cleveland-Cliffs will soon produce.
Many analysts and investors seem to like the company's plan. The stock, after bouncing around the high $30's and low $40's for three years, has risen from $42 in December to $53.6875 at Friday's close. "It's been a long time since Cliffs' stock made a move like that," said David MacGregor, senior analyst with Midwest Research in Cleveland.
Ms. Chase's employer, Schafer Capital Management, is a recent buyer. The firm, based in New York, began accumulating the stock in July and is now Cleveland-Cliffs' largest shareholder, with a 5.8 percent stake. "They definitely fit the profile" of stocks sought by Schafer, a value investor, Ms. Chase said.
Moreover, Cleveland-Cliffs seems somewhat insulated from the price fluctuations for iron pellets, which it produces from six mines of which it is the full or partial owner. And most of its pellets are sold on multiyear contracts with longtime customers; these pacts will be renegotiated next year and Cleveland-Cliffs should be able to win small price increases, according to analysts.
That setup should keep prices stable for a few years, say the analysts, who also note that Cleveland-Cliffs enjoys large reserves in its mines. And though demand for steel may fall slightly, it should be fairly steady for the next five years, according to the Commerce Department.
Another attraction is the royalties that Cleveland-Cliffs receives from its mineral rights in mines that it owns with others, usually steel companies. These royalties contributed $36 million, or 50 percent, of Cleveland-Cliff's pretax profits in 1997. And because the royalties are paid by co-owners who use the iron in their own manufacturing, the income is less vulnerable to the vagaries of demand than other sources of sales.
DESPITE the recent spurt in the stock, fans say it is still invitingly priced. One reason is that 1997 was an off year for the company; a mine closing, production delays and increased capital spending drove down earnings per share to $4.03, from $5.12 in 1996. And sales of inventory from the closed mine masked the usual seasonal lull in the first quarter of 1997, making the first quarter of 1998 look weak by comparison: The company reported earnings of 4 cents a share last week, down from 26 cents. But those problems are past, analysts say.
Obscurity also helps keeps the price low. "We are not well known and try as we might we are still fairly small and tend to get buried," Mr. Brinzo said.
Indeed, the royalties alone could justify a market capitalization of $500 million, said Michael Beall, an analyst with Davenport & Company, an investment firm with a 2.3 percent stake in Cleveland-Cliffs. On Friday, the company's market capitalization was just $610 million.
But the stock seems especially cheap to investors who see a sharp rise in earnings from the new plant and other initiatives. Assuming that Cleveland-Cliffs stock will eventually sell at about 13 times earnings to account for the company's future growth, a target price of more than $65 by next January is reasonable, Mr. Beal said. Others set their sights higher: Mr. MacGregor's company has a target of $75 a share by next March.
Of course, Cleveland-Cliffs faces plenty of risks. It still relies on the integrated steel mills for most of its sales; over many years, these mills are expected to die out. If the economy slows, so will demand for steel; a worsening of Asia's problems could lead to cheaper imported steel products, putting further downward pressure on iron prices.
Competition is also a worry. Other companies, like Nucor, have built or are building plants to make high-iron products. Weighing the competition and the demand for the bricks, Walter Carter, principal and steel analyst for Standard & Poor's/DRI, said the timing of the new plant was "not optimal, but not disastrous."
But even if the company looks dull, its immediate outlook is very strong.
"It's not the sexiest thing around," Mr. Beal said, "but it's a solid piece of equipment."
