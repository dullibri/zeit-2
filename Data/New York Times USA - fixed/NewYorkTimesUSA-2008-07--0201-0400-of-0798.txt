HEADLINE: Oil Decline and Fed Talk Buoy Investors

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street finished sharply higher Tuesday as oil prices dropped for a second day and the Federal Reserve hinted at more help for the ailing financial system. The Dow Jones industrials gained more than 150 points, and all the major indexes were up more than 1 percent.
 Crude prices tumbled $5.33 to settle at $136.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, bringing oil's two-day drop to more than $9. Other commodities also pulled back. 
 The market was relieved to hear the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, say in a speech that the central bank might extend its lending efforts to investment banks. The Fed began allowing the banks to borrow after the near collapse of Bear Stearns this year. 
 At the same forum, a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation conference, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. made an upbeat assessment of the government's efforts to prevent the volume of mortgage foreclosures that touched off the credit crisis last year, although he also said he expected foreclosures to continue.
 Investors have been concerned this week about the health of the government-backed mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The two companies' troubles helped send prices lower on Monday, but they also helped lead the rebound Tuesday.
 Mr. Paulson said he was pleased at the steps Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae had taken to raise money. ''Fresh capital will strengthen their balance sheets and allow them to provide additional mortgage capital, as they balance their responsibilities to their mission and to their shareholders,'' he said.
 The reassurances helped stocks stage a late-afternoon rebound after choppy trading throughout most of the session.
 The Dow rose 152.25, or 1.36 percent, to 11,384.21, in its biggest gain since June 13. The advance left the Dow down 19.6 percent from its October high -- just shy of the 20 percent threshold that signals a bear market.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 21.39, or 1.71 percent, to 1,273.70, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 51.12, or 2.28 percent, to 2,294.42. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 24.46, or 3.72 percent, to 682.72.
 A drop in commodities prices appeared to help quiet some of Wall Street's fears about inflation. Gold, silver, copper, corn and most other agriculture futures sank as oil fell. A rise in the dollar against other major currencies also made commodities less expensive.
 The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that pending sales of American homes fell by 4.7 percent in May from the previous month, heightening concerns that the struggling housing market would stifle consumer spending. 
 But by afternoon, the market's mood was lifting.
 Shares of Fannie Mae rose $1.88, or 11.9 percent, to $17.62; and Freddie Mac shares climbed $1.55, or 13 percent, to $13.46.
 Investors could find further room for optimism on Wednesday. The aluminum producer Alcoa, the first Dow component to report results this period, posted stronger-than-expected earnings for its second quarter. Its stock rose in after-hours trading after falling $1.06 to $32.33 in regular trading.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 5/32, to 99 30/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, fell to 3.88 percent from 3.90 percent.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills and seven-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Paterson Backs Slot Parlor and Wine-Flavored Ice Cream in Bill-Signing Marathon

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson banned smoking in college dormitories, created rules allowing museums to gain title to unclaimed art and even gave his approval to wine-flavored ice cream as he signed 137 bills into law on Tuesday. 
 The governor also signed laws that will increase fines for those who fail to pick up dog droppings or who block the box. One law he signed added offenses to the list of crimes that can land someone on the sex offender registry, while another permitted wine tastings to start two hours earlier on Sundays -- at 10 a.m. 
 He also approved, as expected, an economic development project that will bring a new gambling emporium to the Catskills, at the current site of the Concord Hotel in Sullivan County. 
 ''We have a responsibility in government to enact laws that make our state a better place to live and work,'' the governor said in a statement. ''These bills achieve this in a sweeping fashion.''
 The governor is considering hundreds of bills passed by lawmakers, who wrapped up their session late last month. He also announced on Tuesday that he had vetoed 16 bills, including some union-backed bills that would have expanded binding arbitration to new classes of public employees. 
 But he did sign similar bills into law over the objection of his own budget office, including one that allows for binding arbitration to resolve contract negotiations with the Suffolk County park police. Another new law allows correction officers in some jurisdictions to become detectives or investigators without passing civil service exams. 
 Those two laws were the latest signs of the enormous clout of public sector unions in Albany. The governor signed the second bill, regarding correction officers, even though it was opposed by three branches of his own administration -- the budget office, the Department of Civil Service and the Governor's Office of Employee Relations -- as well as governments in Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk Counties. 
 The bill was backed, however, by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Suffolk County Corrections Officers Association. 
 Asked why he had signed the bills, Risa B. Heller, the governor's communications director, said, ''Once the governor receives a bill, he seeks input from interested parties before he decides whether he will sign or veto it.''
 ''These are recommendations only, and other policy factors must be weighed.''
 A number of the laws signed on Tuesday will have tangible social ramifications, like the legislation banning smoking in dorms. 
 ''We urged the governor to sign this as quickly as possible so it took effect for the fall semester, so we're very pleased,'' said Russell Sciandra, director of the Center for a Tobacco Free New York. 
 Museums and other nonprofit cultural institutions also worked out a deal with lawmakers to create procedures that will allow them to take possession of art or material loaned years ago that has not been reclaimed. In return, museums agreed to new rules on how they sell pieces of their collections. 
 ''There have been a set of problems in dealing with the way in which museums dispose of property they own,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who sponsored the legislation, adding, ''this is a major improvement for museums across the state.''
 Anne Ackerson, director of the Museum Association of New York, said, ''This bill is going to provide legal recourse for all types of museums -- big and small, art history, you name it -- all types of institutions with collections, to be able to gain title of ownership to those materials in their possession that they don't currently own.''
 Other new laws covered a range of issues. 
 One piece of legislation, sponsored by Senator Martin J. Golden, a Brooklyn Republican, and Assemblyman Rory I. Lancman, a Queens Democrat, will overhaul the way the city pays employees who are reservists deployed overseas. The city had offered reservists the option of receiving all of their city pay in addition to their military salaries, which are usually lower, but then required them to repay the lesser of the two when they returned. 
 New laws will require the repayments to be lowered and the terms extended for reservists already in the program. Going forward, the city will simply make up the difference between a reservist's military pay and city salary, eliminating the need for repayments.
 Also, criminal penalties for using brass knuckles as weapons will now be extended to plastic knuckles, while new restrictions were placed on lobstering in Long Island Sound. Finally, the governor approved a bill allowing the manufacture and sale of wine-flavored ice cream. It would be no more than 5 percent alcohol and not available to those under 21.

HEADLINE: IndyMac Announces It Will Close Lending Units and Cut Half of Its Work Force

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Time is running out for IndyMac Bancorp, one of the faded darlings of the subprime era.
 On Tuesday, IndyMac, one of the nation's largest independent mortgage lenders, faced what amounted to a run on the bank. As depositors rushed to withdraw money, IndyMac's share price, already in a free fall, spiraled even lower. 
 The stock, which fetched $50 in 2006, at the height of the housing boom, plunged 38 percent to 44 cents. In two years, more than $3 billion of shareholder value has been wiped out. 
 A once high-flying offshoot of Countrywide Financial, IndyMac confronts an uncertain future. In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, IndyMac, which is based in Pasadena, Calif., said it had largely stopped making loans and would shut its retail and wholesale lending businesses. In all likelihood, IndyMac will undergo an orderly bankruptcy or be sold, analysts said. 
 Depositors' accounts up to $100,000 are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But IndyMac said it would no longer accept big deposits. The company is dismissing half of its 7,200 employees. IndyMac is working with regulators to devise a new business plan, but the company has few options, analysts said. 
 On Tuesday, it sold most of its retail mortgage branches to Prospect Mortgage of Northbrook, Ill.. The price was not disclosed. Now, the only parts of IndyMac that are still functioning are its reverse mortgage business and payment collection operations.
 IndyMac is a casualty of the lax lending standards that symbolized the excesses of the subprime market. As home prices soared in recent years, IndyMac carved out a lucrative niche in so-called Alt-A mortgages. Such loans, made to people whose credit is just above subprime, usually do not require borrowers to provide proof of savings or incomes. 
 But when the housing bubble burst, many Alt-A borrowers were unable or unwilling to pay their mortgages. Wall Street banks, which fostered the growth of subprime lending by bundling the mortgages into securities, balked at buying more loans. IndyMac lost $184 million during the first quarter, and it expects to post an even bigger loss for the second quarter. 
 In its regulatory filing on Tuesday, IndyMac blamed Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, for fanning worries about its financial health. Last month, Mr. Schumer sent letters to the F.D.I.C. and other regulators warning that IndyMac might fail. His comments prompted regulators to restrict the company's borrowing. As a result, IndyMac's so-called operating liquidity dwindled to about $1.7 billion. 
 Mr. Schumer responded on Tuesday, saying the company's business practices and poor supervision caused its problems. 
 ''It is obvious that the breadth of the bad lending that has led to IndyMac's troubles happened over the last few years, not the last few days,'' he said. ''In short, IndyMac was a junior version of Countrywide.''
 Because IndyMac no longer has enough capital to satisfy regulators, the company may no longer acquire big deposits from brokers. In a statement on Monday, the company's chief executive, Michael W. Perry, said: ''We don't expect to be able to raise capital until there is more stability and less uncertainty in the housing and mortgage markets.'' 
 Financial institutions often try to sell assets when they run into trouble. But for IndyMac, that may not be an option. If the company sold assets, they would probably trade at such deep discounts that the move would actually hurt, rather than help, IndyMac's capital position.
 ''They are in for a very difficult period,'' said Chip MacDonald, a banking lawyer at Jones Day in Atlanta. ''They are becoming increasingly boxed in, and their options get narrower.'' 
 IndyMac's dire straits raise questions about its primary regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the viability of the thrift business model, which depends heavily on mortgages. Regulators helped orchestrate the sale of Countrywide to Bank of America in December and encouraged Washington Mutual, the nation's largest savings and loan, to raise capital in the spring. Now IndyMac is in trouble, too. 
 ''On the one hand, they are managing through a difficult environment,'' said Frederick Cannon, chief equity strategist of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ''On the other hand, it raises a more fundamental question about the viability of the thrift industry and the degree that savings and loans took on such significant credit risk. These are some of the largest thrifts in the country.''

HEADLINE: Preparing for Snow in July

 BODY:
Even in midsummer's heat, residents of the eight million or so households with oil-fired furnaces -- more than three-fourths of them in the Northeast -- are worried about winter. The price of heating oil has jumped almost 40 percent this year. Unless prices dive, which seems unlikely, many customers will face the double-whammy of higher fuel prices for their homes and cars. 
 People with money in the bank were able to contract months ago for next winter's oil at then-lower prices. But millions of cash-strapped families will need help. With heating oil now at $4.50 a gallon, compared with $2.50 a year ago, a typical New England homeowner using about 600 gallons a year would see the winter fuel bill rise to $2,700, or nearly $500 a month during the coldest months.
 State and local governments can provide some emergency help. But these governments are also strapped for cash, which means that only Congress can provide relief on the scale that is likely to be needed.
 A bill just introduced in the Senate would provide about $2.5 billion under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Half would be released to the states to help low-income residents pay their energy bills and half would sit in a contingency fund that could be tapped at the discretion of the president. 
 When the bill comes up for a vote, likely later this month, Congress should approve it and President Bush should sign it into law. Last month, $1 billion in additional heating assistance was dropped from a supplemental defense appropriation bill when Mr. Bush threatened to veto the measure unless most nondefense spending was removed. There can be no excuse this time. 
 As the economy slows and oil prices rise, helping Americans who cannot afford to heat their homes is a matter of public health and safety, as well as a moral imperative. People without adequate heat are vulnerable to illness. And people struggling to pay the heating bills may be tempted to skimp on medicines and even food. 
 No one should have to choose between heating and eating. If they act this summer -- as they must, before the presidential and Congressional campaigns send everyone home -- Congress and President Bush can help make sure that nobody has to make that choice.

 BODY:
ARK OF THE LIBERTIES 
 America and the World 
 By Ted Widmer 
 Illustrated. 355 pages. Hill & Wang. $25. 
 There's a nice passage, a dozen or so pages into Ted Widmer's new book about the history of American foreign policy, in which he talks about how delighted European explorers were, once in the New World, to discover tobacco.
 Dried, rolled and lighted, the plant signified nothing less than ''the intoxicating newness, excitement and danger of the Americas,'' Mr. Widmer writes. Then he adds this complicating observation -- one that, to paraphrase Hugo Chavez's comment about President Bush, smells a bit like sulphur: ''That feeling is still there every time a cigarette is lit.''
 How the world sees America in 2008: hot, sexy and toxic. 
 These lines stand out because, like a struck match, they throw sparks and cast some angular light. They also stand out because, by the time you are only a short distance into ''Ark of the Liberties,'' sparks and light are already in painfully short supply. You may already have acquired, in fact, that sinking feeling that comes with the realization that you are in for a long, slow, dithering ride. You've bought a wet pack of Camels.
 Mr. Widmer, a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, takes his title from ''White-Jacket'' (1850), an adventure novel by Herman Melville. ''We Americans are the peculiar, chosen people,'' Melville wrote, ''the Israel of our time; we bear the ark of liberties of the world.''
 Mr. Widmer takes this image, and us, out for a 15-m.p.h. Sunday drive. 
 His book is a winding overview of American foreign policy and the ideas that have animated it, with particular attention paid to America's deeds (some dirty, some much less so) in the name of championing liberty.
 His tour starts with the earliest explorers and makes pit stops at all the scenic overlooks: the Declaration of Independence; the Monroe Doctrine; the aggressions of the Mexican War and the taking of Hawaii; Teddy Roosevelt's realism versus Woodrow Wilson's idealism; the World Wars and Franklin D. Roosevelt's savvy diplomacy; the Bay of Pigs invasion; the Cuban missile crisis; Reagan and the end of the cold war, to name only a few.
 Our recent misadventures in Iraq are barely mentioned until an epilogue, but all of the book's potted scenes are filtered through Mr. Widmer's outraged sense of the failures of Bush-era foreign policy.
 The problems with ''Ark of the Liberties'' begin with Mr. Widmer's prose. If you've wondered why politicians sound as windy as they do, this former speechwriter's sentences are instructive. Far too many of them contain the kind of verbal filler (''I would argue that,'' ''I have tried to show,'' ''It is worth pointing out,'' ''I want to make clear,'' ''An argument could be made,'' ''It is worth restating'') that strangles real writing. These phrases give this book the flop-sweat feel of a sophomore padding out a term paper; all that's missing are the large type, the wide margins and a reeking pile of Red Bull empties.
 Mr. Widmer also happens to be the Amy Winehouse of truism addiction. 
 Nearly every page of ''Ark of the Liberties'' contains a groaner like ''There can be no denying that independence was an extraordinary achievement'' (roger that), or ''I see no reason not to explore our mistakes as fully as our triumphs'' (brave historian!), or ''The past is everywhere, if only we open our eyes to see it'' (zzzzz).
 Cliches, too, pile toward the empurpled sky: books here sell ''like hotcakes''; it is ''always darkest before the dawn''; wars approach with a ''steady drumbeat''; economies grow ''by leaps and bounds'' and at ''breakneck speed''; slavery opens ''a new can of worms''; foreign policy calls for ''brass tacks.'' Mr. Widmer scores bonus anti-style points for the nonironic deployment of the word ''poppycock.''
 All this might seem unfair. It's possible to troll through almost any book and single out a few bum lines. But Mr. Widmer's weak, soupy prose is the foamy broth derived from weak, soupy thinking.
 Again and again (and again) in ''Ark of the Liberties'' he writes the kind of fence-straddling ''on the one hand/on the other hand'' paragraphs that fight themselves to a draw. His usual approach is to sidle up to an issue, attack the extremes of opinion about it and then scamper safely up the middle. 
 ''At its best,'' he writes in a typical formulation, the C.I.A. ''helped presidents stay alert to constantly changing problems in a dangerous world. At its worst, it deepened those problems.'' Multiply those sentences by several hundred, and you will know what it is like to spend time with ''Ark of the Liberties.''
 By his book's close, Mr. Widmer has stopped equivocating. He delivers an embarrassingly fawning assessment of the Clinton years (''I realize that my perspective is hardly objective,'' he sheepishly admits) before moving into an epilogue about Iraq.
 Mr. Widmer has saved the best for last. His epilogue is a blistering, star-spangled essay about how far the United States has drifted from its most noble foreign policy traditions. At this point the reader may safely pluck the toothpicks from his or her eyelids.
 Mr. Widmer's epilogue pulls together the millennial strands he has gathered through ''Ark of the Liberties'' and suggests that, to some people today, ''the war that the Bush administration started does resemble the conflict described in Revelation.'' Worse, we may resemble the Antichrist (''described as a huge invading power exercising terrifying military strength'') a little more than we would wish.
 This epilogue contains another indelible, sulfurous line: ''Rereading the Declaration of Independence can be an uncomfortable exercise in the early 21st century,'' he writes, ''for in a certain late afternoon light it can read like a declaration against ourselves.''
 Alas, it's tough to imagine the hardy reader who hasn't, chapters earlier, jumped screaming from this leaky ark.

HEADLINE: Retail Chain Said to Face Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
Steve & Barry's, the clothing chain that tried to undercut competitors by selling celebrity fashion and shoes for less than $10, was preparing to file for bankruptcy protection late Tuesday in the latest blow to shopping malls battered by the economic downturn. 
 The company's management held discussions over the Fourth of July weekend with Sears Holdings Corporation about a possible bailout or an acquisition of some of its labels, according to people briefed on the talks. 
 Sears and its Kmart unit, under the ownership of Edward S. Lampert, were said to remain interested in some of the labels, but that company was struggling as well. Steve & Barry's, which is privately owned, had been one of the fastest-growing retailers in the country, opening hundreds of stores selling clothes under the names of Sarah Jessica Parker, Venus Williams and Stephon Marbury.
 Even as its business imploded, it claimed annual sales of about $1.1 billion and sales gains of 20 percent in stores open one year or more. But the company's strategy of operating on razor-thin margins and of adding stores in distressed locations with special payments from landlords became tenuous in recent months as the economy weakened.
 Steve & Barry's sudden fall presents another challenge for malls across the country, which are already reeling from announcements by retailers like Ann Taylor and Zales that they will close hundreds of stores, and the recent bankruptcies of Linens 'n Things and Sharper Image. 
 The company ran into a cash squeeze after defaulting on a loan made in March by the commercial lending unit of General Electric, and could not secure other financing, according to people close to the discussions. The company will probably begin to close some of its approximately 270 stores, and could be forced into a full liquidation. The company was trying to arrange bankruptcy financing on Tuesday, according to people briefed on the talks.
 Steve Shore and Barry Prevor, childhood friends on Long Island who founded the chain in 1985, have approached other retailers about acquiring the company or its assets. TA Associates, a private equity firm, owns a minority share in the company, which is based in Port Washington. 
 Discussions with Sears were said to be continuing Tuesday, including the prospect of selling Steve & Barry's brands at Kmart. Kim Freely, a spokeswoman for Sears, declined to comment.
 ''Steve & Barry's merchandise might actually excite the Kmart customer, but it could be very complicated to do this without paying G.E. a lot of money,'' said Howard Davidowitz, the chairman of Davidowitz & Associates, a retail consulting and investment banking firm. He contrasted the situation to the bargain-priced acquisition of the struggling Fortunoff chain by the owner of Lord & Taylor in March. Steve & Barry's does not own the celebrity brands, but licenses their names, so Ms. Parker and others will retain some control.
 ''We are surprised and disappointed that this situation has developed,'' said Ira Schreck, a lawyer representing Ms. Parker. ''We are surprised because our understanding, based on the accounting statements we see, was that sales have been very, very strong.''
 In the last few years, several mall landlords aggressively pursued leases with Steve & Barry's, offering sweetheart rents and other inducements. The company opened more than 200 stores in the last four years. 
 Mr. Shore and Mr. Prevor had begun reinventing their business about two years ago, expanding from their roots selling cheap collegiate apparel by introducing celebrity brands and more fashionable items for women, at prices lower than Wal-Mart. 
 Mr. Marbury, a basketball star, lent his name to shoes initially priced at $14.98, which were marketed as an alternative to other players' sneakers selling for more than $100. Last year, Ms. Parker's Bitten collection was introduced, and the inexpensive jean jackets and batik print cotton dresses were given up to half the floor space in Steve & Barry's stores.
 While the strategy brought hordes of customers, it also crimped operating margins, as the celebrities had to be paid a licensing fee or a portion of sales. As the retail market softened and consumers reduced spending, the company took a risk by lowering prices further, to $8.98, from $14.98. Steve & Barry's was selling some items at a loss, hoping to bolster sales of products with higher margins, like T-shirts. 
 But the cost of maintaining stores was bound to rise because the landlords were paying the company lease incentives, usually one-time payments. 
 ''When you get a free lunch, normally you buy dinner,'' Mr. Davidowitz said. ''They were getting paid millions to take those spaces, but the problem with those payments is that they were not sustainable. They took stores that no one else wanted, and I don't think that was necessarily a brilliant paradigm.''

HEADLINE: McCain Health Plan and That High-Risk Pool

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: PIKESVILLE, Md. 

 BODY:
If Senator John McCain's radical plan for remaking American health care is to work, he will have to find a way to cover people like Chaim Benamor, 52, a self-employed renovator in this Baltimore suburb. Mr. Benamor never found it necessary to buy insurance before having a mild heart attack last year and now, 13 years shy of Medicare, has little hope of doing so.
 The heart attack left Mr. Benamor with a $17,000 hospital bill, $400 in monthly prescription costs and a desperate need for insurance. After being rejected by a number of commercial carriers, he turned to the Maryland Health Insurance Plan, one of 35 state programs for high-risk applicants whom no private company is willing to insure. 
 He decided that the annual premium -- $4,572 for a plan with heavy deductibles -- was more than he could handle on an income of about $35,000. Yet his earnings were too high for him to qualify for state subsidies. 
 ''I'd like to get it, but what do you pay first?'' Mr. Benamor asked at his dining room table. ''Do you pay the mortgage? Do you pay your child support? Do you pay your car insurance? Do you pay for your medicine?''
 In late April, Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, announced that if elected president he would seek to insure people like Mr. Benamor by vastly expanding federal support for state high-risk pools like Maryland's, or by creating a structure modeled after them. But as Mr. Benamor's case demonstrates, even well-regarded pools have served more as a stopgap than a solution. 
 Though high-risk pools have existed for three decades, they cover only 207,000 people in a country with 47 million uninsured, according to the National Association of State Comprehensive Health Insurance Plans. Premiums typically are high, as much as twice the standard rate in some states, but are still not nearly enough to pay claims. That has left states to cover about 40 percent of the cost, usually through assessments on insurance premiums that are often passed on to consumers. 
 Health economists say it could take untold billions to transform the patchwork of programs into a viable federal safety net. The McCain campaign has made only a rough calculation of how many billions would be needed and has not identified a source for the fi-nancing beyond savings from existing programs. Finding the money will only get more difficult now that Mr. McCain has pledged to balance the federal budget by 2013, which already requires a significant reduction in the growth of spending.
 Mr. McCain's proposal stands in sharp relief to that of his Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, who wants to require insurers to accept all applicants, regardless of their health. That is now the law in five states, including New York and New Jersey.
 For those who can afford the premiums, or who qualify for subsidies in the 13 states that provide them, the high-risk programs can be a godsend. 
 Richard and Susan Logan, both of whom have battled cancer this decade, said they were grateful to have coverage for themselves and their daughter through the Maryland plan, even though it will cost $22,232 this year. They had been rejected by 25 commercial insurers, said Mrs. Logan, 57, a part-time billing clerk for a physician. 
 The Logans, who live in Gambrills, near Annapolis, estimate that without the high-risk pool, they would pay $40,000 a year for medication alone. 
 ''The plan's worth its weight in gold for that,'' said Mr. Logan, 62, an aviation accident investigator. ''Otherwise, we'd be paying for the medications out of our retirement.''
 A fifth of the 14,000 participants in the Maryland plan receive subsidies that drop their premiums below the market rates charged to healthy people, said Richard A. Popper, the plan's director. But many in the middle find the policies both unaffordable and intolerably restrictive, and Mr. Popper estimates that two-thirds of those eligible have not enrolled.
 Almost all of the state pools impose waiting periods of up to a year before covering the health conditions that initially made it impossible to obtain insurance. In some states, fiscal pressures have forced heavy restrictions in coverage and enrollment. Florida, which has 3.8 million uninsured people, closed its pool to new applicants in 1991, and the membership has dwindled to 313.
 An informal survey by the American Cancer Society recently found that only 2 percent of nearly 2,700 callers to its insurance hot line enrolled in high-risk pools within two months of being referred to them. ''In most cases, we know they probably didn't apply because they discovered high premiums or pre-existing condition clauses and just didn't bother,'' said Stephen Finan, associate director of policy for the group's Cancer Action Network. 
 There is no census of the medically uninsurable. But in 2006, insurers turned down 11 percent of all individual applicants for medical reasons, including 22 percent of those 50 or older, according to America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group. 
 Finding a way to cover the sickest of the uninsured is critically important because 15 percent of the population is responsible for three-fourths of health care spending. Many wind up in emergency rooms, which cannot legally reject them, leaving hospitals with more than $30 billion in unpaid bills each year. 
 Mr. McCain's proposal, which he calls the Guaranteed Access Plan, would be part of a market-based restructuring that is in many ways more fundamental than the universal coverage proposed by Mr. Obama. 
 With the goal of making the insurance marketplace more equitable and competitive, Mr. McCain would end the longstanding exclusion from income taxes of health benefits paid by employers. The 17 million nonelderly people covered by directly purchased insurance do not enjoy that advantage.
 Mr. McCain would replace the exclusion with refundable health care tax credits of $2,500 per person and $5,000 per family in the hope of driving consumers into the individual insurance market. To help push down premiums, he would allow the purchase of policies across state lines. 
 Currently, those who buy insurance individually often face higher costs because their risks are not spread across broad groups of workers. Though insurers cannot discriminate against participants in group plans, they evaluate consumers seeking individual coverage case by case to determine if they are worth the risk of coverage, and at what price. Insurers contend that if they had to charge the same rates to all comers, many would wait until they were sick to buy policies.
 The McCain campaign recognizes that in an invigorated individual market, even larger numbers of chronically ill people would go without the protection afforded by group coverage. High-risk pools would theoretically serve to fill the gaps.
 Critics argue that, to date, insurers have benefited from the state pools as much as the uninsured. As long as premiums remain above market rates, the pools insulate commercial insurers from the greatest risks while giving customers little incentive to abandon their private policies. 
 ''They are run in ways that protect the profitability of commercial insurers,'' said Karen Pollitz, a professor at Georgetown University who has studied high-risk pools and who has served on the board of the Maryland plan. ''They leave the illusion that there's a safety net without there really being much of one.'' 
 Mr. Obama's plan differs from Mr. McCain's in several ways. In addition to requiring insurers to accept all applicants, he would require that parents obtain insurance for their children. To make premiums affordable, he would create a Medicare-like government plan that would beopen to all and pump up to $65 billion a year into subsidies. The money would come from repealing President Bush's income tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000 a year.
 When Mr. McCain unveiled his high-risk pool proposal, his chief domestic policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, estimated the federal cost at $7 billion to $10 billion. Mr. Holtz-Eakin said five million to seven million uninsured people would be singled out for coverage.
 But in a recent interview, Mr. Holtz-Eakin emphasized that the projections ''could change dramatically'' depending on how the program was structured.
 Mr. Holtz-Eakin and other McCain health advisers, including Thomas P. Miller, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and Stephen T. Parente, a health economist at the University of Minnesota, said premiums would probably be capped at twice the standard rates. They said subsidies might be available to those making up to four times the federal poverty level, or $41,600 for a single person.
 Financial incentives would probably be provided to those who effectively manage their diseases. No decision has been made about waiting periods for pre-existing conditions, the advisers said.
 Mr. McCain's proposal would represent a huge increase over the $50 million a year that Congress now appropriates in grants to the state pools, in a program that began in 2002. But several analysts questioned whether even $10 billion would be nearly enough, given that the states now spend about $2 billion to insure 207,000 people. 
 ''I do not for a minute think it will cost 7 to 10 billion dollars a year,'' Ms. Pollitz said. ''It may cost 7 to 10 billion dollars a week.''
 In an admonition for Mr. McCain, Maryland's five-year-old plan, like others before it, has quickly become a victim of its growth. As enrollment expanded by 30 percent in each of the last two years, actuaries forecast insolvency as soon as 2010 and compelled the plan's board to apply the brakes. 
 Over the last two years, it has raised premiums, deductibles and co-payments, increased out-of-pocket maximums, lowered the lifetime cap on payments and added a waiting period for pre-existing conditions, which rose to six months from two months on July 1. It also increased the amount applicants must pay to buy their way out of the waiting period. 
 At the same time, the plan is making more people eligible for subsidies. To keep it afloat, the state is raising the assessment on hospital bills that provides two-thirds of its financing. 
 ''It's not easy when you see there is strong demand for something and you need to temper that demand,'' Mr. Popper, the plan's director, said. ''But you either find a way to slow enrollment through economic forces or you close the plan and no one gets in, which is a solution that no one wants.''

HEADLINE: Siemens to Cut Thousands From Global Work Force

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
In a sign that the global economy is catching up with Germany, one of the country's largest exporters, Siemens, said on Tuesday that it would eliminate 16,750 jobs across its far-flung operations as it struggles to bolster profits in a weakening business climate.
 The job reductions -- parceled out among Germany, the United States and other countries -- represent about 4 percent of the Siemens work force and constitute a significant retrenchment for the company, which is also laboring to put an extensive corruption scandal behind it. 
 The cuts are also a rare dose of bad economic news for Germany, which has proved to be remarkably resilient over the last year to the woes in the United States and to the strength of the euro.
 Until this week, Germany witnessed a steady decline in unemployment, which is now at its lowest level since 1992. But Siemens, a conglomerate that makes products ranging from light bulbs to locomotives, has often struck a discordant note, lurching from problem to problem.
 Despite a bribery scandal, which implicated senior executives and tarnished its name, Siemens had set an ambitious goal of growing twice as fast as the global economy as a whole. Now it is acknowledging that it may not avoid fallout from the deteriorating economic conditions.
 ''These measures take on special urgency, when you take into account the slowdown in the global economy,'' Siemens's chief executive, Peter H. Loscher, said at a news conference in Munich, where the company is based.
 Mr. Loscher, who has made this plan the centerpiece of his turnaround effort, said the cutbacks would save Siemens 1.2 billion euros ($1.9 billion) by 2010, mostly in sales and administrative costs.
 As is typical in Germany, where labor leaders are consulted on layoffs in advance, these cutbacks had been rumored for days in the news media. With the actual number coming in slightly below expectations, some analysts expressed disappointment that Siemens had not gone far enough.
 ''If you have 400,000 people on your payroll, cutting 17,000 is not that big a deal,'' said Jochen Klusmann, head of research at BHF Bank in Frankfurt. ''Everyone agrees that a ton of efficiencies can be taken out of this company. From that perspective, this isn't so ambitious.''
 Shares of Siemens slumped 1 percent on Tuesday in Frankfurt. Part of the letdown also had to do with the lack of financial details about the plan. The company declined to comment on the size of potential revamping charges, or when it might take them. 
 Mr. Klusmann estimates Siemens will have to take a charge of 1 billion euros ($1.56 billion) to pay severance and other costs for the departing employees, 5,250 of whom will be in Germany.
 Except for Germany, Siemens declined to quantify reductions in other countries. It did say that of the 1,550 administrative jobs eliminated in its health care group, the majority would be in the United States.
 Siemens said it could not give exact numbers because it still had to negotiate with its various unions. This, it said, is also why it did not respond to the stream of rumors about layoffs in recent days.
 ''Those are the rules, and we play by the rules,'' said Siegfried Russwurm, the head of human resources.
 Mr. Russwurm's deference to the rights of workers did not save Siemens from an angry blast by the company's main union, IG Metall, which condemned the reductions as ''totally excessive.''
 ''Siemens is in good shape; the order books are full,'' said the chief of IG Metall in Bavaria, Werner Neugebauer. ''Against that background, the planned job cuts are neither comprehensible nor acceptable.''
 Mr. Neugebauer hinted that the workers might strike, though Mr. Loscher and Mr. Russwurm expressed confidence that this could be avoided if the union talks were handled properly.
 Among other things, they said, Siemens hoped to achieve most of the reductions through voluntary means -- for example, moving people to other jobs. Even as it is slimming down, Mr. Loscher noted that Siemens had 3,200 vacancies in Germany, mostly for engineers and scientists.
 Mr. Loscher said the reductions were the logical extension of a previous overhaul at Siemens, in which he streamlined its operations into three broad categories -- energy, industry and health care -- and trimmed the legal entities under the Siemens umbrella to fewer than 1,000, from 1,800.
 Mr. Loscher, a little-known Austrian who replaced Klaus Kleinfeld last summer in the heat of a bribery scandal, has been struggling to remake Siemens while at the same time trying to restore its name.
 He declined to comment on the scandal, which has led to charges against former executives. Mr. Kleinfeld has not been implicated. Analysts are now watching the Securities and Exchange Commission, which they expect to levy a heavy fine on Siemens.
 For investors, though, the bigger question is whether this latest makeover will finally breathe life into a conglomerate that has always seemed lumbering, particularly compared with rivals like General Electric, though it too has hit a rough patch lately.
 ''Siemens has always been the big restructuring story in Germany,'' Mr. Klusmann of BHF Bank said. ''It's always the story of a Sleeping Beauty who needs Jack Welch to kiss her and wake her up.''

 JAPANESE POLICE OUTNUMBER G-8 PROTESTERS
 Two hundred anti-globalization marchers, demonstrating against world leaders at the Group of 8 meeting on Japan's northernmost island, Hokkaido, quickly found themselves outnumbered by the police as Japan deployed one of the heaviest security operations in its history. Whether this has helped the meeting escape the violence of previous venues is a matter of debate, with many in Japan criticizing the police presence as excessive and very expensive. PAGE A13 
 IRAQI OFFICIALS STRESS TIMETABLE
 Iraqi officials continued to insist that a timetable for the withdrawal of coalition troops must be included in any security agreement with the United States. And in Ramadi, 22 bodies were found at an elementary school that was undergoing construction. Twenty of them were buried in the playing fields, apparently over a lengthy period of time, a local police official said. PAGE A10 
 QUESTIONS ON IRAN'S MISSING
 Iran, sharpening its image contest with Israel amid the standoff over Iran's nuclear program, has resurrected questions about the fate of four of its citizens who disappeared in Beirut in 1982 while Israeli forces occupied the city. Officials in the office of the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said that a letter that the Iranian Mission had released, asking him to intervene to determine the fate of the men, had yet to arrive. PAGE A10 
 G-8 SANCTIONS ON ZIMBABWE
 The leaders of the Group of 8 industrialized powers agreed to impose tough sanctions against Zimbabwe after its violence-marred elections, taking a hard line against the nation despite resistance from leaders of the African Union. PAGE A12 
 CHANGES TO TESTIMONY ON WARMING
 Vice President Dick Cheney's office was involved in removing statements on health risks posed by global warming from a draft of a health official's Senate testimony last year, a former senior government environmental official said. The former official, Jason K. Burnett, made the assertion and described similar incidents in a three-page letter to Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who is the chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

 A park bench with a back shaped like outstretched angel wings and a curved seat that encourages couples to slide closer together is one of many measures taken across Russia for the first Day of Family, Love and Fidelity.

 OBAMA REJECTS ASSERTIONS
 That He Has Moved to the Center
 Some of Senator Barack Obama's recent statements have alarmed some of his supporters, who say he's trying to move to the center as the general election campaign heats up. Mr. Obama pointedly rejected those assertions at a town hall-style meeting in Powder Springs, Ga., saying he plans to end the Iraq war as president, and added that his recent comments about faith were consistent with previous statements and were not changes in his approach. PAGE A19 
 FRAUD REPORTED AT MEDICARE
 Medicare paid millions of dollars to suppliers improperly using the identification numbers of doctors who died years ago, according to Congressional investigators. In one case, Medicare paid more than 2,000 claims totaling $479,000 for services provided from 2002 to 2007, even though the doctor had died in 1999. ''Scam artists have treated Medicare like an automated teller machine, drawing money out of the government's account with little fear of getting caught,'' said Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota. PAGE A16 
 RECONSIDERING PRESIDENTIAL POWERS
 Former Secretaries of State James A. Baker III and Warren Christopher, above, proposed a new system of closer consultation between the White House and Congress before American forces go into battle. Their plan would require the president to consult senior lawmakers before initiating combat lasting longer than a week, except for covert operations or rare cases requiring emergency action.

 EMBEZZLING FROM NONPROFITS
 Two prominent national nonprofit groups were rocked by disclosures of financial misappropriation by employees and contractors. One group, Points of Light, abruptly stopped auctioning off travel packages through its online store after finding ''abnormalities'' in the business practices of the contractor hired to run it. Meanwhile, Acorn, the community organizing group, said that a former finance director had embezzled almost $1 million from it and related charities. PAGE A16 
 ABUSE IN ONLINE MEDICATION SALES
 A new study found that at least 310 Web sites illegally sold controlled medications by mail without a proper prescription. And the Drug Enforcement Administration found that 85 percent of Internet drug sales involved controlled medicines -- compared with 11 percent of prescriptions filled through brick-and-mortar pharmacies -- suggesting that online sales are largely for misuse.

 MORE BAD NEWS FOR SIEMENS
 Siemens, one of the largest exporters in Germany, announced that it would lay off 16,750 workers -- about 4 percent of its global work force. It is a rare bit of bad economic news for the country, which has witnessed a steady decline in unemployment . But the bad news isn't so odd for Siemens, which is also laboring to put an extensive corruption scandal behind it and has seemed to lurch from problem to problem. PAGE C3
 G.M.'S LOOMING CASH CRISIS
 G.M.'s stock is at its lowest point in 50 years, and it may soon have to raise new operating capital to offset a steep drop-off in auto sales. For his part, Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman, has kept mum on the automaker's funding plans since announcing a series of plant closures last month. PAGE C1

Purveyors of high quality sweets are on the move, and like guerrilla fighters for your taste buds, they arrive in trucks at favored New York locales. But they're not selling rocket pops and sundaes. No, instead you will find Belgian waffles, creme brulee, and jam-stuffed oatmeal cookies. Page D1

 A GUMBO OF PUNK,

 The Fourth Annual Afro-Punk Festival in Brooklyn was the largest yet -- 10 days, 40 bands, 15 films-- and Jon Caramanica says that the growth has taken its toll. ''A bigger umbrella leaves more room for huddling,'' he writes. And so each day's performance is a little too neatly divided among genres. Still, it was the many skateboarders who made the most noise. PAGE B5 
 A 'GISELLE' WITH ADDED BUZZ
 The announcement that 2009 will be Nina Ananiashvili's last with the American Ballet Theater has added even more buzz to the company's season-ending production of ''Giselle.'' Alastair Macaulay says the production is the Ballet Theater's best production of a 19th-century ballet classic. ''In one crucial sense, 'Giselle' is the classic of all ballet classics,'' he writes. ''Why? Its drama is about dance itself.'' PAGE B1
 A BOOST FOR ITALIAN CINEMA
 Two Italian films won the top runner-up prizes at the Cannes Film Festival in May, sending the country's news media and intellectuals into a tizzy. Some people began pronouncing it the advent of a somewhat inartfully named new movement called neo-neorealism. ''At the heart is a way of looking at the world or a person or society for what it is,'' an Italian film executive said. PAGE B3

But last fall, after Mr. Schumacher crashed his car, he was found to be over the legal limit for alcohol and tested positive for amphetamines -- and the implications continue to hover over his performance.

 The epic match between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in the Wimbledon final nearly overshadowed the impressive showdown between Venus and Serena Williams the previous day. The common refrain about their matchups had always been that they resulted in less-than-riveting tennis, but what was once sisterly competition has become a full-fledged rivalry.

HEADLINE: Fed Sees Turmoil Persisting Deep Into Next Year

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; Rachel L. Swarns and David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Federal policy makers have concluded that the turmoil plaguing the housing and financial markets is likely to spill deep into 2009, becoming one of the most significant domestic problems to confront the next president when he steps into the White House in January.
 Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, publicly indicated on Tuesday that he believes the problems will persist into next year when he outlined a series of steps the Fed is considering in the coming months. 
 One such step would extend low-interest lending programs to Wall Street's largest investment banks into next year. The programs, one of which was set to expire in September, can continue only if the Fed issues a finding that there are ''unusual and exigent circumstances'' that justify them. 
 Mr. Bernanke also recommended that Congress grant the Fed broader authority to monitor and supervise the financial markets to assure greater stability in the future. But with time running out on this session, lawmakers are unlikely to adopt such legislation before next year. 
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said in a speech last week in London that the problems of the housing and financial markets might last longer than originally expected.
 He followed up in another speech on Tuesday by saying that the Bush administration was working to prevent as many home foreclosures as possible, but that ''many of today's unusually high number of foreclosures are not preventable.'' Mr. Paulson said 1.5 million home foreclosures were started in 2007 and that an estimated 2.5 million more would take place this year. 
 Still, the markets seemed reassured that Washington officials were redoubling their efforts to resuscitate the weak housing sector, despite the downbeat comments. The Dow Jones industrial average, which has fallen sharply in recent weeks, closed up 1.4 percent, or 152 points. 
 Mr. Bernanke said that the Fed would issue next week long-awaited rules to restrict new exotic mortgages and high-cost loans for people with weak credit. Such mortgages have been a central cause of the current market problems.
 The Federal Housing Administration will also begin an expanded effort next week to help a larger group of troubled homeowners refinance their adjustable mortgages. Under the plan, homeowners would be eligible to refinance even if they have missed up to three monthly mortgage payments over the previous 12 months. 
 Homeowners who have fallen behind on their payments because of job loss, declining wages and family illness would also be eligible, even if their rates have not increased. Homeowners are now eligible only if they were current on their mortgages before their interest rate was adjusted upward.
 For its part, Congress is close to completing legislation on a $300 billion foreclosure-rescue plan that would help troubled borrowers refinance into more affordable loans insured by the federal government. The Senate is expected to approve a measure by next week.
 The Fed created the lending programs to Wall Street in March as part of a broader effort to prevent financial institutions from collapsing, as Bear Stearns nearly did before it was sold under heavy pressure from the Fed and the Bush administration to JPMorgan Chase. 
 The lending programs to the investment banks, a broad expansion of the Fed's historic practice of providing loans only to commercial banks that the Fed supervises, are intended to provide confidence to financial institutions that they will have enough cash to meet their daily needs. And by permitting investment banks to post collateral for Fed loans, including hard-to-sell financial instruments backed by mortgages, the programs have helped prop up the enormous and troubled market in securities sold by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the all-important mortgage-finance companies. 
 The two buyers of mortgages, which together held more than $1.4 trillion of mortgage-backed bonds as of the end of last year, have struggled in recent months through the wave of foreclosures and declining housing markets. On Tuesday, Fannie Mae closed up nearly 12 percent, and Freddie Mac rose 13 percent, after their regulator said he would probably not force them to raise more capital because of an accounting rule change. The shares of both government-chartered companies had tumbled on Monday amid concerns over the accounting rule and worries that the worst of the mortgage crisis was yet to come. 
 Officials said that the Federal Reserve remained concerned that the declining housing market would not reach its bottom and financial markets would not become more stable before some time next year, and that the economy would continue to suffer as a result of declining consumer confidence, a sluggish global economy and the widespread effects of the rapid jump in oil prices.
 ''The financial turmoil is ongoing, and our efforts today are concentrated on helping the financial system return to more normal functioning,'' Mr. Bernanke said at a forum in Virginia on lending for low- and moderate-income households. He did not provide a forecast of how soon he expected markets would begin to turn.
 ''Although short-term funding markets remain strained, they have improved somewhat since March,'' Mr. Bernanke said, reflecting both the intervention of the Fed in offering loans to Wall Street and ''ongoing efforts of financial firms to repair their balance sheets and increase their liquidity.''
 Officials said that the Fed privately reached the view some time ago that weakness in the housing and financial sectors would likely continue well into next year. Mr. Bernanke's comments Tuesday were not intended to signal any change in interest-rate policy. 
 In his speech in London, Mr. Paulson emphasized that the financial markets have yet to adapt to the changing climate. ''Working through the current turmoil will take additional time, as markets and financial institutions continue to reassess risk, and re-price securities across a number of asset classes and sectors,'' Mr. Paulson said. 
 The Federal Housing Administration's expanded program to help more troubled homeowners refinance, called F.H.A. Secure, was announced in April at a time when fewer than 2,000 homeowners at risk of foreclosure had been helped by it. Housing Secretary Steven C. Preston said the expanded program would help an additional 100,000 borrowers in crisis by the end of the year. So far, more than 260,000 homeowners have refinanced through the program, the vast majority of them people who have paid their bills on time. Mr. Preston predicted that 500,000 families would be helped by year's end.
 Mr. Preston warned, however, that F.H.A.'s efforts could be derailed if Congress passed housing legislation that failed to safeguard the agency's financial stability. He said he was concerned about efforts to eliminate the agency's plans to use risk-based pricing, which would allow F.H.A. for the first time to charge higher mortgage insurance premiums to borrowers viewed as presenting a higher credit risk.
 He said he was also concerned about efforts by some lawmakers to maintain an agency program in which the seller finances the down payment on a mortgage. The program has suffered high delinquency and foreclosure rates in recent years, and the F.H.A. hopes to eliminate it. 
 If the Senate, as expected, adopts housing legislation by next week, differences need to be ironed out in the House, which approved a similar measure in May. Though the White House has expressed some willingness to negotiate, the administration has not rescinded a veto threat.
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, urged Republican lawmakers to speed up the bill, which has been slowed by a procedural fight despite broad support among lawmakers in both parties. ''Since the last stall on the housing bill, 85,000 more Americans have received foreclosure notices -- 8,500 a day,'' Mr. Reid said. ''Tomorrow it will be over 90,000. Every day they squander the Senate's precious time, the American people lose.''

HEADLINE: Golisano and His Cash Are Back, With Legislative Races in Their Sights

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Tom Golisano, the unpredictable Rochester businessman with deep pockets and never-ending political ambition, brought fresh drama to a chaotic election year on Tuesday with his announcement that he would pour at least $5 million into the state's legislative races.
That is about 10 times what the average Senate candidate spends in an election, and slightly more than all the money held in the Republican Party's statewide campaign accounts.
His aim, Mr. Golisano said at a news conference, was to throw a scare into -- and maybe even replace -- Albany's political elite. He certainly drew their attention.
''Those elected officials on either side of the aisle who are not focused on Tom's issues should be focused on them now,'' said Assemblyman Bill Reilich, a Rochester-area Republican. ''He puts his money behind his beliefs, and people definitely take him seriously.'' 
Mr. Golisano was critical of the state's top leaders, especially Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the Assembly. Mr. Golisano, who has run for governor three times and flirted two years ago with a fourth bid, also said that he thinks about running for governor again ''every day.''
But his influence may be most felt in races this fall for the State Senate, where Republicans have ruled for more than 40 years but now cling to a one-seat majority, their last redoubt of power in Albany.
Mr. Golisano's political leanings are not easy to categorize. Although he ran on the Independence Party ballot in his three bids for governor, he considered seeking the Republican nomination in 2006 and has been friendly with Joseph L. Bruno, who stepped down last month as Senate majority leader.
But Mr. Golisano acknowledged on Tuesday that he had had informal conversations with at least three Democrats who are challenging Republican senators in western New York, adding that he was no longer certain that New York was well served by a Republican majority in the Senate.
''A lot of people have had the philosophy: to have a Democratic Assembly and Republican Senate is a good way to have a good system of checks and balances,'' Mr. Golisano said. ''If it's been successful, you could have fooled me.''
At the news conference, he criticized state leaders for spending too much money and for passing too many costs to local government, saying that budget increases should be limited to the rate of inflation. He emphasized that it was not enough to cap local property taxes, as Mr. Paterson has proposed, and that they needed to be cut.
Mr. Golisano also called for changing the state's system for financing campaigns and drawing legislative districts, two issues that have long been the bane of government watchdog groups that argue that generous campaign finance limits and extensive gerrymandering have made the Legislature immune to public pressure.
''The establishment doesn't want to get it done,'' he said.
Any candidate who supported his goals, Mr. Golisano said, would have his support. Those who did not would have a problem.
''We are going to endorse Republicans, we are going to endorse Democrats, we are going to endorse independents,'' said Mr. Golisano. ''It's going to be for candidates all over the state.''
It was clear on Tuesday that Mr. Golisano's announcement had certainly been noticed by incumbents in both parties, especially in western New York, where he is well known as a businessman, philanthropist and the owner of the Buffalo Sabres hockey team.
Erick Mullen, a political consultant for two Democratic congressional candidates in the region, said that Mr. Golisano's re-entry into politics would ''redefine kingmaker in the Empire State.''
''Golisano will shift the center of political power away from Albany and paralyze any Republican contemplating a run for governor,'' said Mr. Mullen, who was a strategist for Mr. Golisano in his 2002 bid for governor. ''The big question is, to what end?''
If Mr. Golisano does play a major role in the legislative contests, it may set the stage for a billionaires' battle with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has been a generous patron of Senate Republicans in recent years, regularly writing $500,000 checks to party leaders.
On Tuesday, people from both parties seemed eager to align themselves with Mr. Golisano's movement, or at least to avoid antagonizing him.
John E. McArdle, a spokesman for Senator Dean G. Skelos, the new majority leader, downplayed suggestions that Mr. Golisano would target Senate Republicans, noting that they have supported many of the causes Mr. Golisano is now pressing.
''We've had a very active and good relationship with Tom Golisano, and he has been very supportive of the majority,'' Mr. McArdle said.
Mr. Golisano also tempered speculation that he might back a primary challenger to Mr. Silver, who represents a Lower Manhattan district. Two such challengers -- Paul Newell, a community activist, and Luke Henry, a lawyer -- have emerged recently, but Mr. Golisano said he had not spoken to either one.
Mr. Golisano's past political efforts have had mixed success; he failed to garner more than 15 percent of the vote in any of his three races for governor. But those efforts made the Independence Party, which Mr. Golisano helped establish in 1994 with millions of dollars of his own money, the state's third largest, with a permanent slot on state ballots.
It remains a potent force in New York and its endorsement is considered a precondition of victory for Republicans in many areas of the state.
His new group, which he named Responsible New York, will be organized as an independent committee, solely financed by Mr. Golisano. Under the state's broadly drawn election laws, the group will be able to spend as much money as Mr. Golisano desires on whatever he wants, including advertisements that advocate for or against candidates. The only condition, said Mr. Golisano's lawyers and officials at the state Board of Elections, is that the committee not coordinate in any way with any candidate for office.
But the new committee is still likely to draw legal challenges from Democrats and Republicans, said Blair Horner, the legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group.
''I think the parties will mobilize at warp speed on this issue,'' said Mr. Horner.
He added that he did not share Mr. Golisano's interpretation of state election laws, saying that he thought that the new committee might be restricted in what it could say about candidates in independent advertisements. But he said there was a ''delicious irony'' to the notion of Mr. Golisano using a loophole in the campaign finance laws to give a headache to incumbent lawmakers.
''Incumbent legislators who accepted the status quo could face a challenge through one of the loopholes they refused to close,'' Mr. Horner noted.

HEADLINE: Qatar, Playing All Sides, Is the Mideast's Nonstop Mediator

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH

 BODY:
DOHA, Qatar -- In the past month, after Qatari diplomats brokered a landmark peace deal for Lebanon in talks here, this tiny emirate on the Persian Gulf has enjoyed a brief moment of giddy celebrity.
Editorialists praised the Qatari emir as a modern-day Metternich. Huge billboards went up on the road to the Beirut airport, proclaiming, ''We all say: Thank you Qatar.'' An ice cream shop in downtown Beirut put out a sign offering a Doha Agreement Cone.
But the Qataris did not linger over their diplomatic triumph. They were too busy trying to solve every other conflict in the Middle East.
In the past year alone, the Qatari foreign minister, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani (widely known as H.B.J.), has flown his jet -- repeatedly -- everywhere from Morocco to Libya to Yemen, using charm, guile and large amounts of money to mediate disputes, with varying success. 
This work has not always earned him gratitude. In an increasingly divided Arab world, the Qataris have fashioned a reputation for themselves as independent-minded arbitrators who will cozy up to anyone -- Iran, Israel, Chechen separatists -- in pursuit of leverage at the bargaining table.
''We don't have an agenda, and we don't keep all our eggs in one basket,'' said Hassan al-Ansari, the director of gulf studies at Qatar University.
That is putting it mildly. Qatar has close ties with Iran, yet it also is host to one of the world's biggest American air bases. It is home both to Israeli officials and to hard-line Islamists who advocate Israel's destruction; to Al Jazeera, the controversial satellite TV station; and (at least until recently) to Saddam Hussein's widow. Saudi Arabia is a trusted ally, but so is Saudi Arabia's nemesis Syria, whose president, Bashar al-Assad, received an Airbus as a personal gift from the Qatari emir this year.
''They really put all the contradictions of the Middle East in one box,'' said Mustafa Alani, a security analyst at the Gulf Research Center in Dubai.
The Qataris also back their diplomacy with some eclectic investments. Many Americans know about the emir's gift of $100 million to help Hurricane Katrina victims, but Qatar is also building a $1.5 billion oil refinery in Zimbabwe, a huge residential complex in Sudan and a $350 million tourist project in Syria.
Some call Qatar's policy deranged. The Qataris prefer to think of it as useful. Blessed with enormous oil and natural gas reserves, Qatar is surrounded by large and ambitious neighbors: Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Diplomacy has become a way for Qatar to protect itself and its riches, by forming alliances and by trying to stabilize the region.
''The idea is to try to keep everybody happy -- or if we can't, to keep everybody reasonably unhappy,'' said one former Qatari official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss foreign policy. ''If that makes the Americans or the Russians a little cross, well, tough luck.''
It does make them cross. American officials have been quietly furious about Qatar's assistance to Iran and Syria, which includes substantial financial investments as well as votes against sanctions on Iran during Qatar's tenure on the United Nations Security Council. The Americans are also angry about Qatar's hefty financial aid to the militant Palestinian group Hamas after it won elections in 2006.
''Their relationship with us has been complex, bordering on one of animosity,'' said a high-level State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to give offense, adding that Qatar's support for Hamas had been a ''very vexatious problem.''
The Russians have complaints too. Qatar provided sanctuary to the Chechen rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev until two Russian secret agents killed him in 2004, detonating a bomb in his car as he left a mosque in Doha. The agents were captured by Qatari authorities and convicted of murder, but later extradited at Russia's request.
Various Arab governments have also at times lost patience with Qatar, mainly because Al Jazeera, founded by the Qatari emir, broadcast criticisms of them. Saudi Arabia broke diplomatic relations with Qatar over this issue in 2002, and they were not restored until 2007, after Qatar promised to rein in coverage of the kingdom.
Some of Qatar's recent diplomatic adventures -- which include negotiations with rebels in Yemen and Morocco and help in freeing Bulgarian nurses accused of spreading AIDS in Libya -- have backfired. In April, Ethiopia broke off relations, saying Qatar's support for Eritrea had made it ''a major source of instability in the Horn of Africa.''
There is also some anger among Arabs about the warm welcomes received by Israeli officials in Doha, where Israel also maintains a trade mission -- located, as it happens, not far from a villa owned by Khaled Meshal, the leader of Hamas.
At times, Qatar's multifaceted approach to the world has bordered on comedy. In March 2003, Qatar hosted a meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference aimed at forestalling the American invasion of Iraq, even as preparations for that invasion were taking place nearby at the American military base. As the final communiques were being read, military cargo planes could be heard soaring overhead.
Mr. bin Jaber, the foreign minister, who is also prime minister, has been coy about the details of Qatar's unusual diplomacy. He has given some interviews in which he says Qatar wants ''good relations with everyone'' and defends his country's relationship with Israel. He declined to be interviewed for this article.
Qatar's policy was born in 1995, when the current emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, carried out a bloodless coup against his father, who was on vacation in Switzerland. The new emir instantly began transforming Qatar from a sleepy, inward-turned backwater into a dynamic new state. At home, he began an ambitious remodeling of the emirate's education policies with the help of his wife, Sheikha Mozah bin Nasser al-Missned. Abroad, the emir and his cousin, Mr. Jaber, began building a bold new way to engage with the world while maintaining their country's independence.
In some ways it makes perfect sense. A thumb-shaped peninsula just east of Saudi Arabia, Qatar is a natural intermediary precisely because it is so small and harmless, with just 200,000 citizens. (There are about three times as many foreigners in the country.)
''They are not a threat to anyone, and there is no strategic interest behind their diplomacy aside from the moral gain,'' said Mr. Alani, the Dubai analyst.
Qatar also has an absolute monarchy and virtually no domestic dissent. It is therefore free, unlike almost every other country in the world, to pursue iconoclastic policies abroad without worrying about how they play at home. The fact that Qatar also has the world's highest per capita gross domestic product, at more than $80,000, probably helps to keep things quiet.
Unlike some other countries in the region, Qatar has had only one terrorist attack, a suicide bombing in March 2005 in a Doha theater popular with Westerners. One British citizen was killed and a dozen other people were wounded.
Despite occasional diplomatic problems and frequent complaints, Qatar's policy seems to have worked, catapulting the country to new levels of recognition around the globe.
The Qataris' greatest success by far was the Lebanon agreement in May. Every major power with an interest in Lebanon had tried to resolve the country's 18-month political crisis. All of them failed, in part because all were seen as favoring a particular group within Lebanon's political mosaic. Qatar, with its policy of favoring everyone and no one, was the obvious choice for a mediator when violence worsened in May.
But Qatar did not succeed by default. Several Lebanese politicians who took part in the negotiations praised both the Qatari foreign minister and the emir for their skill.
''They made an interesting and subtle diplomacy,'' said Walid Jumblatt, the Lebanese Druse leader.
According to Mr. Jumblatt and others involved in the negotiations, the Qataris started out by letting the various Lebanese parties vent their grievances. Days later, when negotiations seemed at an impasse, the Qatari emir -- who had sought and been given permission to speak on behalf of all the major regional powers with an interest in Lebanon -- abruptly changed his tone.
He gathered the Lebanese leaders and issued a stark warning: This was the last chance. Everything else had been tried, and if the deal fell through, they might as well begin a civil war at once, because there was no other option.
That warning appears to have worked. It has also had a fringe benefit for the Qataris themselves, whose reputation has grown just a bit brighter.
''In the old days, nobody had really heard of Qatar,'' said Abdel Aziz al-Mahmoud, the editor of Al Arab, a newspaper in Doha. ''Now, once you say 'I'm from Qatar,' it's, 'Step right this way.' ''

HEADLINE: Surprisingly, Oil Declines For 2nd Day

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Oil prices headed in an unusual direction -- down -- for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, leaving energy experts to wonder whether the drop is the beginning of a lasting trend or just a brief pause before another surge.
Oil settled at $136.04 a barrel, a drop of $5.33, or 3.8 percent. Analysts said the immediate causes included the strengthening of the dollar in recent days and the apparent veering northward of Bertha, the first hurricane of the 2008 hurricane season, meaning it was likely to miss the oil and natural gas facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. 
They also noted that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran had dismissed the possibility that war with the United States and Israel was imminent in remarks to reporters in Kuala Lumpur, relieving worries that Iran might try to block oil shipments in the Strait of Hormuz.
The decline bolstered a rally in the stock market, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 152.25 points, or 1.36 percent, to 11,384.21. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended up 1.71 percent, at 1,273.70, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 2.28 percent, to 2,294.44.
But even as a barrel of oil lost more than 6 percent of its value since the Fourth of July weekend, energy analysts warned that it was too soon to predict an outright collapse in prices. Some predicted that this was just one more in a series of pauses that has accompanied the volatile rise in oil prices from $60 last summer and just below $100 at the beginning of the year.
Others were just left bewildered.
Chip Johnson, the president and chief executive of Carrizo Oil and Gas, a Houston-based company, said he was ''confused'' by ''such wild swings.'' But he added: ''I can't see oil getting cheap again ever. It's just too hard to find, and too many people want to use it.''
Any sustained decline in oil prices could help the consumer at a time when higher food and energy prices have forced many to cut back spending on other goods. It could also help the ailing automotive and airline industries, lower the trade deficit and strengthen the dollar. Prices for gold, silver, copper and corn also dropped on Tuesday.
But the factors bringing down oil prices over the last two days could be short-lived. Traders have been using oil as a hedge against the dollar in recent years, and there is no assurance the dollar will strengthen for long if the economy further weakens. Another hurricane could develop at any time, and the strongest normally come in August and September. Tensions in the Middle East, Nigeria and other oil-producing areas can always erupt to put pressure on tight reserves.
''I don't think there has been any change in the overall direction of the oil market,'' said Addison Armstrong, director of market research at Tradition Energy, an energy broker that deals with banks and hedge funds. ''The bias is still clearly to the upside, with $150 firmly in the sights of traders.''
Consumers have felt no immediate relief at the pump. The price of the average gallon of regular unleaded gasoline on Tuesday remained at nearly $4.11, the same as the day before, and about a dime more than a month ago and $1.14 more than a year ago.
The rise in gasoline prices has not matched the rise in crude oil prices in recent months, largely because Americans are driving less, buying fewer gas-guzzling vehicles and using more mass transit.
MasterCard reported on Tuesday that American drivers decreased their consumption of gasoline in the days leading up to and including the holiday weekend by nearly 4 percent from the year before. It was the 21st consecutive week of lower gasoline consumption in comparison with last year.
So far, however, the decline in American oil consumption is being offset by increasing consumption in China, India, Latin America and in oil-producing countries. The Energy Information Administration, a United States government agency, reported that world oil consumption rose during the first half of 2008 by 520,000 barrels a day compared with the first half of 2007, even though consumption in the United States and other industrialized countries declined by 760,000 barrels a day.
The agency further projected that the average price this year for West Texas Intermediate Crude, the common benchmark price, would be $127, up from the 2007 average of $72 a barrel. Its projection for 2009 is $133 a barrel, slightly less than the current price.
But some energy experts say the price could drop further. They say it is possible that the kind of ''demand destruction'' for oil that is taking place in the United States and Europe could spread to China, India and other countries that subsidize gasoline and other energy supplies.
Governments in China, India, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia have cut subsidies at least modestly in recent months because of strains on their budgets, and further subsidy cuts are considered likely, especially if oil prices continue to go up. Once their consumers see higher prices, they would be expected to cut their consumption.
''I see the pressure mounting on China big time,'' said Fadel Gheit, an energy analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. Mr. Gheit said he could foresee oil prices going as high as $170 by the end of the summer before plummeting. ''The faster oil prices go up, the more severe the correction is going to be,'' he added.
China is thought to have stockpiled oil supplies in recent months to assure adequate reserves of diesel fuel and gasoline for the Olympics in August and avoid embarrassing shortages while the country is trying to impress the world.
Once the Olympics are over, some energy experts predict the Chinese will decide to cut subsidies further and try to control oil imports, easing demand on world supplies and helping to bring crude prices down.
''There is no reason oil could not drop below $100 a barrel again,'' said Phil Flynn, an energy analyst at the Alaron Trading Corporation. ''You could see a substantial sell-off.''
James Crandell, an energy analyst at Lehman Brothers, said he also sees oil prices easing in the coming months but he offered several caveats.
''Hurricanes are the biggest upside risk for prices this summer,'' he said, adding that ''a conflict arising between Israel and Iran that would disrupt supplies would have an equal if not greater impact.''

HEADLINE: That Sputtering Sound

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Like a gas-thirsty S.U.V. crawling to the pump, General Motors needs to fill up fast with cash.
Despite a broad overhaul since 2006, the nation's largest automaker may soon have to raise new operating capital to offset a steep decline in United States vehicle sales. Investors worried about its prospects, including the possibility of bankruptcy, have driven G.M.'s stock down to about $10, its lowest point in more than 50 years.
G.M. executives privately dismiss the notion that they might someday be forced to seek Chapter 11 protection, but pressure is building on Wall Street for the company to raise cash in the equity and debt markets. 
''The rapid change in the external environment, especially fuel prices and demand, has outpaced G.M.'s most aggressive restructuring timetable,'' said John Casesa, managing partner of the consulting firm Casesa Shapiro Group in New York. ''G.M. needs capital to finish the job.''
G.M. has $23.9 billion in cash on hand, along with credit lines of $7 billion.
Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman, has declined to comment on the automaker's financing plans since announcing a series of plant closings last month. He and other senior G.M. executives will not be available for interviews until a course of action is made public, according to a spokesman, Tony Cervone.
Simple math suggests the automaker has enough cash to last through 2009, if analysts' estimates are accurate that G.M. is spending $1 billion more each month than it is taking in. But G.M.'s cash cushion seems far from comfortable given the extraordinary drop in auto sales.
Soaring gas prices and a weak economy sent new-vehicle sales down 10 percent in the first half of the year. G.M. performed worse than the overall market, with its sales down 16 percent through June.
And the market for big pickups and sport utility vehicles, which analysts say earn a profit of up to $10,000 each on models like the Chevrolet Suburban and Cadillac Escalade, dropped by 25 percent as consumers have fled to more fuel-efficient vehicles.
G.M., as well as rivals Ford Motor and Chrysler, have idled thousands of workers and shut plants that make S.U.V.'s and pickups. But closing plants won't help G.M.'s balance sheet.
One industry analyst, Himanshu Patel of JPMorgan Chase, forecasts that G.M. will burn through a combined $18 billion in cash this year and next. While he discounts fears of bankruptcy, Mr. Patel said in a research note that ''liquidity concerns'' will require G.M. to borrow up to $10 billion before the end of this year.
''G.M. is burning cash fast, but it still has many unencumbered assets that can be borrowed against,'' he said.
The automaker is prepared to cut more white-collar jobs and is delaying some product programs to conserve cash. G.M. has also put its Hummer brand up for sale, and may consider eliminating, downsizing or selling off marginal brands such as Saturn and Pontiac.
Mark LaNeve, G.M.'s head of North American sales, tried to tamp down those rumors by circulating a letter to dealers Tuesday saying the company was not holding strategic reviews of any brands except Hummer.
Cutting jobs or dumping brands will reduce costs, but those actions will not replace revenue lost in the slumping vehicle market.
''Plant closings, elimination or sell-offs of some product lines, and further white-collar cuts will only slow the agony,'' said Louis Lataif, dean of Boston University's School of Management and a former Ford executive. ''These actions cannot restore profitability.''
Mr. Patel and other analysts predict that the overall vehicle market will rebound in 2010. By then, G.M. expects to introduce new passenger cars that could stabilize its market share.
Still, G.M. will need capital to ensure its survival until the market recovers. The company also needs to quell fears among investors and, it hopes, revive its share price.
G.M. has few sizable assets to sell, but the company could issue new stock to raise money. One possibility would be a ''rights offering'' that gives current shareholders the first opportunity to buy new shares, according to two people with knowledge of G.M.'s plans.
Another option would be to seek cash from private investors in return for preferred shares that pay a special dividend.
G.M. could also borrow several billion dollars by pledging assets in its growing international operations as collateral.
''The international operations are G.M.'s jewels right now,'' said David Cole, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''If they could borrow against them, it would go a long way toward solving this cash-flow nightmare.''
Raising more cash would allow G.M. to continue critical development work on vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt, its promising electric car due to go into production in late 2010.
Analysts have also raised the possibility of G.M.'s asking the United Automobile Workers union to delay the company's financing of a new health-care trust for retired workers.
G.M. pushed hard for the creation of the trust in contract talks last year because it would remove health-care bills from its balance sheet.
But with its cash reserves dwindling, the automaker may be hard-pressed to come up with the funding for the trust. The union, for its part, may need to weigh whether G.M. would be able to fund retiree health care if the company were to file for bankruptcy. Neither G.M. nor the union has been willing to comment on the possibility.
Ford appears better positioned than G.M. to ride out the downturn in sales. It has a bigger cash hoard of about $29 billion, because of a historic debt offering two years ago in which Ford pledged nearly all of its assets as collateral. The company is also burning less cash each month, according to analysts.
Ford also has a major investor, the financier Kirk Kerkorian, who has indicated a willingness to lend the automaker money to finance its operations.
Just two years ago, Mr. Kerkorian was a large shareholder in G.M. before a falling out with management.

HEADLINE: RICHEST NATIONS PLEDGE TO HALVE GREENHOUSE GAS

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Andrew C. Revkin contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
RUSUTSU, Japan -- President Bush and leaders of the world's richest nations pledged Tuesday to ''move toward a low-carbon society'' by cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2050, the latest step in a long evolution by a president who for years played down the threat of global warming.
The declaration by the Group of 8 -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Russia -- was the first time that the Bush White House had publicly backed an explicit long-term target for eliminating the gases that scientists have said are warming the planet. But it failed to set a goal for cutting emissions over the next decade, and drew sharp criticism from environmentalists, who called it a missed opportunity.
On Wednesday, leaders of developing nations took up the climate change issue and said that they too supported ''a long-term global goal for emission reductions,'' but they were not specific and fell short of supporting the Group of 8 declaration. 
In a sense, the Group of 8 document represents an environmental quid pro quo. In exchange for agreeing to the ''50 by 2050'' language, Mr. Bush got what he has sought as his price for joining an international accord: a statement from the rest of the Group of 8 that developing nations like China and India, which have not accepted mandatory caps on carbon emissions, must be included in any climate change treaty.
European leaders, who have long pressed Mr. Bush to take a more aggressive stance on global warming, said the declaration could enhance efforts to reach a binding agreement to reduce emissions when negotiators meet in Copenhagen next year under United Nations auspices.
''This is a strong signal to citizens around the world,'' the president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, told reporters. ''The science is clear, the economic case for action is stronger than ever. Now we need to go the extra mile to secure an ambitious global deal in Copenhagen.''
The leaders of the eight industrialized countries, who gathered on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido for their annual meeting, spent months debating the language of Tuesday's communique in lower-level talks. Critics said it was short on specifics, and that developed and developing countries would need to make much sharper cuts in emissions to head off the worst effects of global warming.
The statement left unclear, for instance, if the cuts made by 2050 would be pegged to current emissions levels, or 1990 levels, as many advocates had hoped.
A 50 percent cut from current levels would result in a smaller decrease by 2050 than Japan and European nations had envisioned under the Kyoto Protocol, the international climate agreement that the Bush administration rejected after it took office. Kyoto and earlier agreements had set 1990 as the baseline for cuts. The United States emitted about 20 percent more carbon dioxide in 2007 than it did in 1990.
''It is one step forward from the U.S. point of view, because President Bush has agreed that the United States, for the first time, must be bound by an international treaty,'' said Philip E. Clapp, director of the Pew Environment Group, who is here monitoring the negotiations. ''But the emissions reduction goal is extremely weak; the language in the communique is almost meaningless.''
The White House painted the document as a victory.
''The G-8 is giving a lot, but the G-8 is also suggesting that others need to be part of that equation,'' said James L. Connaughton, Mr. Bush's top environmental adviser. ''And that's a very important shared statement.''
Mr. Bush did not speak publicly about it, although Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany raised the issue when she appeared briefly before cameras with the president, before the document was released. Mrs. Merkel, who has been pushing Mr. Bush to take a stronger stance on global warming, pronounced herself ''very satisfied.''
Yet already, there are signs that the document could produce a rift between rich and poor nations. South Africa's minister of environmental affairs, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, issued a blistering critique of Tuesday's communique, calling it a concession to ''the lowest common denominator'' and expressing concern that it ''may, in effect, be a regression from what is required to make meaningful change.''
Cutting emissions in half is one step in curtailing warming, climate experts have long said, because the main greenhouse gas generated by human activities, carbon dioxide, can persist for a century or more in the atmosphere, once it is released. As long as more is being emitted than the oceans or plants can absorb, its concentration will rise. And fuel emissions are projected to rise relentlessly, driven by quickly expanding economies in Asia.
For Mr. Bush, with just six months left in office, Tuesday's declaration was part of a concerted effort to salvage his legacy on climate change. His reputation as an outlier on the issue was set in the earliest days of his administration, when he abandoned a campaign promise to limit carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and refused to join the Kyoto Protocol because it did not apply to developing nations.
But over time, Mr. Bush's stance has shifted. In 2005, he surprised Europeans when, on a trip to Denmark, he stated unequivocally that humans caused global warming.
Some advocates credit the Group of 8 with Mr. Bush's shift. ''The peer pressure on issues like climate change has helped,'' Dennis Howlett, coordinator of the Canadian advocacy group Make Poverty History, said Tuesday.
On the way to last year's Group of 8 meeting in Heiligendamm, Germany, Mr. Bush proposed his own process for grappling with global warming: a series of meetings involving so-called major emitters, including the developing nations China, India, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico, dubbed the Outreach Five.
Those leaders have been meeting this week in Sapporo, also on the island of Hokkaido, and on Tuesday they issued their own declaration, pledging, without specifics, to work toward reducing emissions in ''a deviation from business as usual'' if developing countries offered them financial assistance to do so.
''This is a positive answer to the G-8 leaders' demand for action by all major emitters,'' said David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. ''That's news.''
Tuesday's communique was not the end of the discussion here. On Wednesday, the Outreach Five leaders and their counterparts in South Korea, Indonesia and Australia joined the Group of 8 for a second round of talks and a declaration from the entire group was issued suggesting they believed developed countries should share the biggest portion of the climate change burden.
Alden Meyer, who is tracking the negotiations for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said Tuesday evening, ''Developing countries want the industrialized world to do more.''
The climate paper was among a series of communiques issued Tuesday on matters as varied as the rising food prices, the global economy, aid to Africa and the political crisis in Zimbabwe.
Environmentalists' feelings were perhaps best summed up in an ad in The Financial Times on Tuesday, placed by Avaaz.org, an international online advocacy group. It showed the faces of Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, Mr. Bush and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada pasted on the Japanese cartoon character Hello Kitty.
''Hello Kiddies,'' the headline read. ''Be a grown-up. Set 2020 climate targets now.''
Apologies on Berlusconi Profile
WASHINGTON (Agence France-Presse) -- The White House offered embarrassed apologies to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy on Tuesday, after it had handed out an unflattering profile of him and his country's politics.
Briefing notes that were given to reporters accompanying President Bush to the Group of 8 meeting in Japan described Mr. Berlusconi as one of the ''most controversial leaders in the history of a country known for government corruption and vice.''
''There was obviously a mistake and sloppy work,'' said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman.
Correction: July 16, 2008, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Wednesday about a pledge by leaders of the world's richest nations to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 misstated the title of Philip E. Clapp, an environmental analyst who commented on the pledge, and misstated the name of his organization. Mr. Clapp is deputy managing director of the Pew Environment Group, not director of the Pew Environmental Group.

HEADLINE: Ups and Downs for Older Cities in Population Report

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In a modest reversal, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego and some of the nation's other older cities registered small gains in population in the year ending July 2007, while others slowed their declines, according to census figures released Thursday. 
 Growth slackened in some booming Sun Belt cities. Still, that region was home to 9 of the 10 cities registering the largest numerical gains in population. The only one outside the region -- New York -- ranked sixth in numerical growth from July 1, 2006 to July 1, 2007. The city gained about 24,000 residents in that period, increasing its population to 8.3 million. The annual gain was somewhat less than earlier in the decade. New York City's population has expanded by 265,000 since 2000, more than any other American city. 
 The city has not decided whether to dispute the latest census estimates, which it has successfully challenged in the past to win more federal aid, said Arun Peter Lobo, a demographer with the Department of City Planning. ''More than a quarter of a million since 2000 is pretty respectable,'' he said.
 Andrew A. Beveridge, a demographer at Queens College of the City University of New York, attributed the slower growth to a cooling economy since the middle of the decade.
 Washington recorded a slight gain in the latest survey, but for the first time was bumped from the 25 most populous cities, overtaken by Nashville. The mayor of Nashville, Karl Dean, attributed its nearly 1 percent population increase, to nearly 590,000 residents, to its ''vibrancy.'' 
 ''We are a city that has been recognized in recent years as a top location to live, work and do business,'' Mr. Dean said.
 In Washington, the city administrator, Dan Tangherlini, took the half-full approach. ''We are happy that our population continues to grow,'' he said.
 Some older cities appeared to benefit from the housing slump, which made leaving for outlying areas and for developing cities in the South and West less alluring. 
 ''Older and coastal cities are retaining more residents who otherwise might have moved to the suburbs and faster-growing regions,'' said William H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution. The trend, he said, could accelerate if gasoline prices and commuting costs continue to grow. 
 An influx of younger immigrants also contributed to the older cities' modest population gains. ''In some places,'' said Mark Mather, associate vice president for domestic programs at the Population Reference Bureau, ''it looks like immigrant family growth is starting to offset long-term population losses.'' 
 Houston led the nation in numerical growth, adding nearly 39,000 residents in the year ending July 1, 2007, to top 2.2 million. The next nine biggest gainers were Phoenix, which had ranked first the year before; San Antonio; Fort Worth; New Orleans; New York; Atlanta; Austin, Tex.; Charlotte, N.C.; and Raleigh, N.C. 
 Continuing a population comeback from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans grew faster than any of the bigger cities -- by 13.8 percent, or nearly 30,000 people. But the 239,000 residents counted in July 2007, according to the Census Bureau, were still less than half of the population in 2000.
 Many of the fastest-growing cities in the Sun Belt are really adolescent suburbs, adjacent to more established cities where growth had slowed somewhat. 
 In addition to New Orleans, the 10 fastest-growing cities with 100,000 or more people included Victorville, Calif., about 80 miles northeast of Los Angeles on the southern rim of the Mojave Desert, in San Bernardino County, which surpassed 100,000 for the first time; two Dallas suburbs, McKinney and Denton; Killeen, Tex., north of Austin; North Las Vegas, Nev.; Cary, N.C., near Raleigh; Port St. Lucie, Fla.; Gilbert, Ariz., near Phoenix; and Clarksville, Tenn., on the Kentucky border. 
 Among the nation's 25 most populous cities, Baltimore, Detroit, Memphis and Philadelphia recorded population declines. Among cities of 100,000 or more, Cleveland led in numerical losses, down by about 5,000 residents, or 1.1 percent. 
 Chicago, which lost about 60,000 people since 2000, registered its first gain of the decade, about 8,000, in the latest year. Boston, which recorded a slight loss in the year ending July 2006, rebounded with about 4,000 more people in the next year. Boston was the fastest-growing city in the Northeast, with Newark in second place. 
 Los Angeles also did a backflip into the plus column after a tiny drop the year before. San Francisco and Minneapolis continued gains compared with losses earlier in the decade.
 ''It looks like a combination of factors is driving this,'' said Dr. Mather, of the Population Reference Bureau. ''Lower rates of domestic out-migration, possibly linked to the housing slump, combined with high rates of international migration and natural increase.'' 
 About 1,000 San Franciscans moved elsewhere in the country in the latest year surveyed, far fewer than the overall loss of 84,000 since the decade began.
 In Florida, all but 2 of the 18 big cities recorded slower growth or greater population declines from 2006 to 2007. Orlando's rate of population increase was halved, to 1.9 percent, from 3.9 percent. In Atlanta, though, the rate increased, to 4.1 percent, the highest in this decade.

HEADLINE: New York City's Budget, and the Most Vulnerable

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''The Needy and Budget Priorities'' (editorial, July 7): 
 At a time when attention to the needs of New York City's low-income communities is scarce, you are to be commended for shedding light on the negative effect of the city's recently adopted budget on New York City's most vulnerable residents. 
 The budget fails to adequately address the fiscal crisis gripping the city's Housing Authority, creating the real possibility that public housing sites that host essential child care, Head Start, youth and senior programs will soon be closed. 
 Budget cuts will also reduce or eliminate the number of summer jobs for teenagers, after-school programs, legal services and programs for people living with H.I.V.-AIDS.
 With tough economic times expected to continue, it is imperative that the mayor and the City Council modify this budget to preserve strong human services for the New Yorkers who need it most.

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Manager Describes Rock Bottom

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
One by one, John Devaney sold his treasures, hoping to forestall what was in the end inevitable. He sold his Renoir and his Gulfstream, his home and his helicopter. Even his cherished yacht -- gone. 
 But on Wednesday Mr. Devaney, who made and then lost a fortune trading mortgage investments, finally called it quits. He shut his hedge fund, and told his investors that all their money was gone too. 
 ''I'm devastated, I'm totally devastated,'' Mr. Devaney said by telephone from Aspen, Colo. ''I feel horrible that I've lost my own money and that so many people who saw the skills I have and trusted in us have now been hurt.'' 
 It is a stunning downfall for Mr. Devaney, whose brash bets in the markets -- and equally brash public pronouncements on the perils and promises of subprime mortgages -- made him something of a Wall Street celebrity.
 For Mr. Devaney, things finally unraveled in late June, just before his 38th birthday. Deutsche Bank called in margin loans, demanding that he pay back $90 million by the next day. When he could not pay, the bank seized his fund's assets on June 26 to auction them, he said. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. 
 Mr. Devaney's Horizon Strategy fund, founded near the height of the mortgage bubble, is just the latest hedge fund to fall victim to the credit squeeze. Several others, including Peloton Partners and Sailfish Capital Partners, have stumbled as well. 
 But in the secretive world of hedge funds, Mr. Devaney stood out for his unusual willingness to go public with his views. 
 Many of the hedge funds that have run into trouble lately bought the same sort of mortgage investments that have cost Wall Street banks so dearly. But because hedge funds are private firms, their losses are not generally visible to the public. 
 In an interview Wednesday, Mr. Devaney called himself a fighter and described his efforts to avoid the collapse of his fund during the last year. He said he had personally lost more than $150 million. And he described his plans to rebuild his business and reputation.
 ''I've taken as much pain as virtually anybody in this industry,'' Mr. Devaney said. ''I am bleeding, personally.''
 He said he was determined to recover money for his investors last July, when he froze his funds, blocking investors from removing their money. But in September, a bank demanded he repay a large loan. That bank, which he would not name, seized 40 percent of the equity in his hedge funds. His accountants and lawyers told him to shut down his funds. But he did not, he said, because he wanted to try to save his investors' money.
 ''Other guys who are only looking at dollars and cents would have shut the fund down,'' he said. ''I have battled it out to try to save all my investors.''
 In September, Mr. Devaney said he stopped receiving management fees on the funds, paying expenses out of his own pocket. He was also staggering beneath a $50 million trading loss in his main broker-dealer business, United Capital Markets Holding, which is still in business. 
 The only money Mr. Devaney made last year came from his personal liquidations -- some at a profit, like his Renoir, which he bought for $9 million and sold for $13.5 million. 
 Mr. Devaney thinks the mortgage crisis is nowhere near its end and expects regional banks and insurance companies to face big losses on mortgage bonds. 
 On June 26, as his hedge fund slipped away, Mr. Devaney sat down and wrote a letter to customers of his brokerage business, warning of the pain to come. For all his troubles, Mr. Devaney was unbowed Wednesday. 
 ''Do I pack up everything and quit?'' he said. ''Do I retire? No!''

HEADLINE: Before You Pilfer That Cupcake ...

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN. 
E-mail: belkin@nytimes.com

 BODY:
DEAR Colleague:
 When you can tear yourself away for a moment from text-messaging friends during meetings and humming along with your iPod deskside, we need to talk. It's about your manners.
 You may have some, but we think you've forgotten to bring them to the office lately. What's with the toilets that go unflushed, the inconsiderate and somewhat alarming noises coming from your carrel (are you really clipping your toenails?) and the science experiments in the office refrigerator that are the remains of last Friday's lunch? 
 Hint: Your mother doesn't work here. 
 We, your fellow workers, admit we are crankier than usual and more easily annoyed lately. Not only do we arrive hot and sticky and leave under the threat of thunderstorms, but there's this economic downturn, so our days are stressed. 
 Finding that you have once again ''borrowed'' our stapler and desk chair, and helped yourself to the Milk Duds we keep for emergencies ... Well, let's just say your stash of purloined toilet paper that you use when the communal supply runs out is in serious danger. (You think we don't know where it is?)
 Pushing your co-workers to the edge has consequences. Take one of our heroines: Lynne R. Viccaro. Every day her work at her former marketing job on Long Island was made all but impossible by a woman at a nearby desk who had an enmeshed relationship with her cellphone. It was also her home phone, and therefore rang all the time. Its ring tone (''Get the Party Started,'' by Pink) was set at rock-concert decibels, and despite direct requests from surrounding colleagues, the woman never changed the setting to vibrate. 
 One day the offender went to a meeting and the phone ''started thumping and pumping'' on her desk, Ms. Viccaro said. In a moment of inspiration, Ms. Viccaro took the shrieking device and wrapped it in bubble wrap and duct tape until it resembled a noisy basketball, then crammed it into the bottom drawer of its owner's desk. 
 ''The real fun started,'' Ms. Viccaro explained in an e-mail message, ''when she got back and heard the now-muffled sound of her cell,'' trying to announce a missed call. She rescued the phone from its plastic tomb and shrieked ''Who did this to my phone?'' 
 Ms. Viccaro proudly confessed. 
 ''Why?'' the woman yelled. 
 Ms. Viccaro's reply? ''Because there wasn't an open window nearby.'' 
 Well done, we say. Well done. 
 We also applaud Shirley Van Scoyk, a real estate agent with Weichert in West Chester, Pa., whose nemesis was not a phone but a coffee mug. A sink full of them, actually. 
 There are 70 employees in her office, she said, and each seems to believe that a dishwashing fairy comes in the night. ''How is it that an adult enjoys a cup of coffee in a mug, then rinses it and puts it, full of water, into the sink and walks away?'' she asked in a tone that suggests she has asked this before and never received an answer. ''What exactly do they think is happening to that mug to get it back into the cupboard?'' 
 What is happening now is that the mugs simply disappear. 
 ''I just started throwing the dirty ones away,'' Ms. Van Scoyk said, unremorseful. ''Someday, there won't be any. And then I guess we won't have a sink full of dirty mugs.'' 
 Not every plan is that effective, alas. Carey Hart and the other employees at BlastMedia, a media relations company in Indianapolis, have spent two years trying to stop food thieves in the kitchen their agency shares with other businesses in the building. When BlastMedia employees chip in for pizza and put the leftovers in the refrigerator, the slices disappear. One day all that was left was a single pepperoni in an empty box. 
 Goodies disappear from the office suite, too. There were eight Funfetti cupcakes in the conference room when Ms. Hart left work one evening. By morning, two remained. There were four Twixs, four Reese's peanut butter cups and four Kit Kats, placed as bait under a stack of napkins on a desk over a weekend. On Monday, half were gone.
 Ms. Hart and her co-workers have written their names on the boxes, placed polite notes inside and sealed packages with company logo stickers; nothing stops the sneaky snackers. 
 ''We've thought of baking cupcakes with Ex-Lax as revenge,'' she said, ''but we haven't taken it that far. Yet.''
 We don't want to resort to drastic measures, either. Hence this note. Anonymous messages like these, the kind you find stuck to the communal refrigerator or the hallway bulletin board, are a timeworn tradition. They are as much a part of office communication as official memos or e-mail messages and, at times, probably far more effective. 
 Nowadays nothing has official standing without a Web presence. Behold, the collection of notes like the ones now found at passiveaggressivenotes.com, which celebrated its first birthday last month. (Warning: some may not be suitable for children or workplace screens.)
 Using the site as an unscientific sample, Ms. Hart is not the only one with kitchen frustrations. A series of notes, for instance, is devoted to disappearing Hot Pockets, which Kerry Miller, the founder of the Web site, calls ''the car radios of the communal freezer.'' 
 The first note, handwritten on a dry erase board, said: ''To Whoever stole my ''HOT POCKET'': It's NOT DONE and NOT NICE.'' A second, scribbled on paper, said, ''Dear Hot Pocket THIEF! Stop Stealing it's Wrong -- & I'm hungry with no lunch!!! Thanks.'' That is followed by a computer printout: ''To the individual whom stole the hotpockets! They did not belong to you! By you consuming said hotpockets, you have committed a theft! This shall not be tolerated!''
 BATHROOM etiquette is also a popular topic on the site. Because we do bring our manners here to work, we won't describe the unsanitary behavior that prompt these notes in restrooms across the land. 
 One of the few we can quote is a pet peeve of ours, too. ''This is not a reading room,'' said a page on the door of a men's room at a nonprofit organization in San Francisco. ''Those who often wait somewhat patiently for the restroom to be free would appreciate it if everyone would keep that in mind.''
 There are other ways to get your message across, by the way. Lisa Kogan, a columnist for O magazine, ranted in the April issue about her search for ''The Tinkler.'' Her nemesis regularly leaves ''her Jackson Pollock'' imitation across the toilet seat and the stall floor. 
 ''She has become the bane of my existence,'' Ms. Kogan wrote.
 Three months after the column appeared, Ms. Kogan has yet to identify the culprit. But the offense itself has stopped, which proves that humiliation need not have a name attached in order to work. We are hoping it works on you, Dear Colleague. We will be watching for a change in behavior. If it doesn't happen, be warned. Ms. Hart's laxative idea sounds very appealing.

HEADLINE: Petty Welcomes Investor Into the Family Business

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Sometimes, even American originals have to sell a piece of themselves.
 Richard Petty is one of the great sporting icons, who transformed his business, who takes over an event just by being there, with a black Charlie 1 Horse cowboy hat looming over his bladelike face.
 In that same head-turning, conversation-stopping category, one could include Ted Williams, Arnold Palmer, Billie Jean King, Bill Russell, Jim Brown, Wayne Gretzky from Canada, Sandy Koufax, Pele from Brazil and, of course, the Greatest himself, Muhammad Ali. 
 King Richard draws stares in New York, the bridge between the old boys who ran moonshine in souped-up stock cars and the super-rich new boys like Jeff Gordon and Jimmie Johnson, who maintain pieds-a-terre on the island of Manhattan.
 ''I'm old guard,'' Petty said Wednesday, 36 stories high, visiting the New York aerie of Nascar. ''I stay at home. I don't even carry a cellphone,'' he said proudly, adding that he is also computer illiterate.
 He turned 71 on July 2 but has learned a new trick -- selling a majority of the family business, Petty Enterprises, to Boston Ventures, a private equity firm.
 ''It's better to own 30 to 40 percent of something than 100 percent of nothing,'' Petty declared. Perhaps he should have leaned out a window overlooking Park Avenue, imparting his country wisdom to speculators who were probably running their own corporations into the ground even as King Richard spoke.
 This slender relic drove his first race on July 12, 1958, finishing sixth. To commemorate that event, he will drive guests around Chicagoland Speedway on the anniversary this Sunday, before the actual race.
 He has partners now, just like the Maras of New York, who sold part of the football Giants, and several other Nascar firms that have sold part of themselves. Just this week, it was learned that the Rooneys of Pittsburgh may sell a chunk of the Steelers.
 One could get all sentimental about the change from hardy pioneers like Lee Petty, who begat Richard, who begat Kyle, who begat Adam. However, on May 12, 2000, Adam Petty died in a crash at a speedway in Loudon, N.H., interrupting the Petty dynasty because Adam's younger brother, Austin, now 26, never wanted to drive.
 ''As I get older, as Kyle gets older, we don't have our grandson here,'' Petty said Wednesday. ''This is something we've been talking about for four or five years,'' he said of the new partnership. ''This is for my family. That's what happens to family businesses.''
 Petty said the soaring price of gasoline is more of a problem for the fans who travel long distances than for the teams that drive hundreds of miles around the track.
 ''Nascar is at the mercy of the fans,'' he said. ''The fans are at the mercy of gasoline. Television ratings are up but attendance is down, so it works out. It gets so expensive.''
 Does he have any answer for the economics of racing? ''We usually go into a town on Thursday night,'' he said. ''We could cut back a day or two, go in Saturday, go back Sunday, but then we are cutting back on the people at the motels. There's no simple answer.
 ''In the 1970s, when we had a fuel shortage, we looked it up,'' Petty continued. ''The New York Giants were using more gasoline to fly to California for a football game than we are for a 500-lap race. If we cut 10 percent, the gas companies would raise the price.''
 Even with American automobile manufacturers in flux, Petty said he expected to receive the 20 to 25 Dodges used in a racing season. Another sign of the nervous economy is the drivers who lose, or cannot find, a sponsor. Petty said that some sponsors were happy as long as their product was selling, but he added that some drivers might get desperate if they saw their sponsorship eroding. ''Sometimes a driver is driving over his head,'' he said.
 Nascar maintains that its drivers are safer than ever because of recent products like Head and Neck Support, softer walls and the Car of Tomorrow. Petty insisted that past innovations were ''kind of slipped in.''
 ''Fire extinguishers, better seats, roll bars, we didn't tell nobody,'' he said. ''We didn't want to tell people it was dangerous.''
 Asked if the recent innovations would have saved the lives of his grandson, or of Dale Earnhardt, who died Feb. 18, 2001, King Richard, in there behind the wraparound sunglasses, said: ''You could probably say 99 percent yes. It was a multitude of things. But look, I drove 32, 33 years, I broke a lot of stuff, but it's still attached. I'm still moving around.''
 He added: ''I feel really lucky. I was able to grow. I am Nascar. I am history. I was there. I put in my two cents and others put in their 98 cents. It makes you feel proud to be part of it.''
 The family name is still on the product, with that American original, King Richard, reassuring people that Petty Enterprises still keeps its roots, even with such a thing as a new majority investor.

HEADLINE: Using Star Power to Repair Nigeria's Image

BYLINE: By ANGELO RAGAZA

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria 

 BODY:
It's hard to rehabilitate a country -- especially Nigeria, best known these days for violence in the oil-producing Niger Delta.
 But Nduka Obaigbena is used to long odds. The Nigerian media mogul -- part Bono, part P. Diddy -- has been challenging his country's often brutal kleptocracy for decades. And, in what passes for high praise from the organization that has consistently rated Nigeria one of the most corrupt nations in the world, Nancy Z. Boswell, president and chief executive of Transparency International-USA, says of Mr. Obaigbena's efforts to clean up his country, ''There is reason to be cautiously optimistic.''
 Mr. Obaigbena (pronounced Oh-bayg-BEH-na) has more enthusiastic fans. ''Nduka obviously has a remarkable vision, real passion and a special message,'' said Naomi Campbell, the supermodel and a converted admirer. ''He's not just a promoter. The more I found out, the more I wanted to be involved.'' 
 So did John Howard, the former Australian prime minister. ''There are so many investment opportunities at present that good governance is going to be quite material in where that investment goes,'' he said by phone from Sydney. ''Obaigbena is striking a blow for the truer path.'' 
 But can a party save a country?
 Every year since 2000, Mr. Obaigbena has honored Nigerians who fight graft or injustice, in particular government officials and corporate executives who exemplify good governance through financial transparency, accountability and respect for the law.
 But he celebrates them by hosting the likes of Ms. Campbell and Mr. Howard at star-filled events, including the ThisDay Awards, named for his media empire and the influential independent newspaper at its center. The last awards ceremony was attended by politicians and socialites, including Mr. Howard, former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin of France and Paul Begala, a former adviser to Bill Clinton.
 Since 2006, Mr. Obaigbena has also held a mammoth summer concert series promoting Nigeria's economic and political progress, the ThisDay festival, luring the likes of Beyonce, Jay-Z, P. Diddy and Shakira to perform in Lagos. 
 The next concert, Africa Rising, is scheduled to take place in Abuja on Friday, starring Mary J. Blige, Usher and Rihanna, as well as Ms. Campbell. On Aug. 1, it travels to the Kennedy Center in Washington, headlined by Beyonce and Seal.
 To some observers, the lavishness of Mr. Obaigbena and his events -- he brought in a dome from Davos, Switzerland, for the 2008 awards -- undermines their credibility and their message. 
 ''All this talk about good governance does not go beyond sloganeering,'' said Philip Ikita, a Nigerian journalist, sociologist and development worker. ''We who have stayed connected with our rural population know that there is no progress for the Nigerian people.''
 Mr. Obaigbena disagrees. ''We have the longest period of democracy in Nigeria, ever,'' said the mogul in March, sitting in a suite at the St. Regis in New York. ''We have new leadership. We have to sustain that momentum.''
 Though no one is saying Mr. Obaigbena is responsible for those changes, he has become their promoter, just as he promotes his glittery events. And his optimism is not completely unwarranted. To be sure, half of Nigeria's population lacks access to potable water, and the infant mortality rate is 1 in 10 births. But foreign investment nearly quadrupled from 2000 to 2006, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Because of a financial restructuring and swelling oil prices, Nigeria has almost no foreign debt, almost $50 billion in foreign reserves and a growing trade surplus. 
 Sectors other than oil have grown, too: in 2007, Nigeria's telecommunications industry was set to overtake South Africa's as the largest on the continent. ''Among our clients, particularly banks, hedge funds and investors, there is a lot of interest in Nigeria,'' said Sebastian Spio-Garbrah, an analyst for the Eurasia Group, a New York-based political risk analysis consultancy.
 Crucial to that interest is the progression of Nigeria's anticorruption efforts, which began in 2002 with the establishment of the Economic and Federal Crimes Commission. 
 With $380 billion looted from the government treasury since independence in 1960, Nigeria has become synonymous with graft. Its vast oil resources ''will not be enough to attract foreign investment if there were a complete loss of confidence in governance,'' said Mr. Howard. 
 What role Mr. Obaigbena's ThisDay Award has had in encouraging good governance is impossible to say -- it has honored people whose efforts are already well known. Winners have included Bukola Saraki, the governor of Kwara state who invited Zimbabwean farmers persecuted by the regime of President Robert Mugabe to resettle in Nigeria; and Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the former finance minister who negotiated $18 billion in debt relief for Nigeria and was named managing director of the World Bank in 2007. 
 Last year, ThisDay honored Nuhu Ribadu, the anticorruption chief who oversaw 200 convictions in Nigeria since 2003, bringing down several senators, governors and a former chief of police.
 Still, Mr. Obaigbena has not abjured the trappings of power. An elegant man with a blunt, chiefly demeanor and a taste for bespoke Lanvin suits, he maintains a home in Lagos, a country estate in Nigeria's Delta State and a penthouse at the Ritz Carlton in Washington. 
 He will not disclose his net worth, but says that ThisDay's corporate parent, Leaders and Company, of which he owns 95 percent, had $100 million in revenue in 2007. He earned $20 million from real estate and stock holdings. 
 ''I like to live modestly and discreetly,'' said Mr. Obaigbena, with no trace of irony. 
 Outside Nigeria, paparazzi frequently snap him in velvet-rope settings with the likes of Lil' Kim and Ice-T. ''He's a larger-than-life personality,'' said Bayo Alade-Loba, head of sub-Saharan banking for Credit Suisse. 
 A descendant of the Ika, one of the smaller of Nigeria's 200 ethnic tribal groups, Mr. Obaigbena began ThisDay as a weekly, then called ThisWeek, in 1987. 
 During a violent government crackdown on the press in the late 1990s, he was arrested for publishing articles criticizing the military regime of Gen. Sani Abacha. ''Scores of journalists were arrested and killed,'' he said. ''The publisher of our competing paper, The Guardian, was shot and almost died.'' 
 After a brief detention, Mr. Obaigbena went into exile for two years, returning just a month after Mr. Abacha's death. ThisDay has continued to be a lightning rod. A 2002 editorial criticizing Islamic officials for condemning the Miss World pageant led to ThisDay's offices being ransacked and burned; fatwas were issued against its editors. 
 In December 2006, the editorial board chairman, Godwin Agbroko, winner of the 1997 PEN Freedom to Write Award and a fearless critic of Nigeria's ruling party, was found in his car after work hours, fatally shot in the neck. 
 The next month, ThisDay's offices suffered another arson attack. ''We get threats every day,'' Mr. Obaigbena said. ''But it doesn't matter. We'll keep speaking the truth.'' 
 At the next festival and awards, Mr. Obaigbena plans to sound the drum for microfinance as the way to empower Nigeria's 146 million people. As he sees it, if the sleeping giant that is this consumer market, the largest in Africa, were to rouse, ''African superpower'' would no longer be a contradiction. 
 ''It's a new country emerging,'' he said. ''And it's time to showcase it.''

HEADLINE: Good Intentions, Vague Promises

 BODY:
This week's summit meeting of major industrialized nations in Japan yielded two important firsts on global warming. For once, the Bush administration was not in full foot-dragging mode, joining in a pledge to halve global greenhouse gases by midcentury. And the big emerging nations, including China and India, agreed to long-range (if unspecified) cuts in emissions. 
 For all that good news, summits are usually about vague promises and good intentions, and this one was no different. The final agreement establishes no interim goals that would require prompt and meaningful investments in cleaner energy. Many scientists believe that cuts of at least 25 percent in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 are necessary to prevent emissions from reaching a point of no return. And as the South Africans dyspeptically but accurately observed, without short-term targets the long-term goal is an empty slogan.
 Nor should anyone put too much store in the promises from the emerging countries. 
 China and the others made it clear that mature industrial economies like the United States and Europe -- whose per capita emissions greatly exceed those of the developing world and who have contributed the most to the man-made emissions already in the atmosphere -- must do most of the heavy lifting. They also warned that they could not move forward without significant capital investment from the West. 
 This was tough talk but, as the industrialized nations conceded, not without a certain historical justice. Unfortunately, without the full participation of China, India, Brazil and other fast-growing economies, there is no hope of stopping and reversing global warming. 
 China may have already passed the United States as the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. And according to some calculations, the world's rich countries could shut down their carbon dioxide emissions entirely and still not keep atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases from reaching unacceptably dangerous levels. 
 Last December, the world's nations, large and small, agreed in Bali to negotiate a new and comprehensive global treaty by the end of 2009 to replace the Kyoto Protocol. As the Japan summit suggests, this will not be easy. But at least the biggest emitters seem willing to sit down in the same room. 
 The United States must finally step forward. Much has been made of President Bush's plodding evolution on climate change -- from denial to acceptance to, finally, vague pledges to help -- but the truth is, the Bush years have been wasted years. 
 Until the United States is willing to make an unambiguous commitment to reducing America's emissions, with clear targets and timetables, the rest of the world will keep finding excuses not to do the same. The next president and the next Congress must provide that leadership.

HEADLINE: Pact on Gas Emissions Eludes Rich and Developing Nations

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Martin Fackler contributed reporting from Rusutsu, and Andrew C. Revkin from New York.

DATELINE: RUSUTSU, Japan 

 BODY:
Rich nations and emerging powers on Wednesday declared climate change ''one of the great global challenges of our time.'' But they set no short-term goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with the largest developing countries demanding more action by wealthy nations before moving. 
 The declaration grew out of an unprecedented meeting that brought together 16 nations, rich and poor, and the European Union on global warming. The session, organized by President Bush, took place here on the northernmost Japanese island of Hokkaido, where leaders of the Group of 8 pledged Tuesday to ''move toward a carbon-free society'' by seeking to halve worldwide emissions of heat-trapping gases by 2050. 
 But a group of the largest emerging economies, led by India and China, now the leading source of greenhouse gases, refused to sign on to that goal. They are holding out until rich nations like the United States take more aggressive steps to cut pollution over the next decade. 
 That fissure prevented the 16 countries from ''reaching any meaningful understanding'' in the special session on Wednesday, said Alden Meyer, who is tracking the talks for the Union of Concerned Scientists. Others said the declaration was important at least symbolically and could set a course for action. Phillip E. Clapp, of the Pew Environment Group, said the declaration helped prepare the way for the next American president to grapple with climate change when the United Nations negotiates a binding treaty in Copenhagen in 2009.
 ''It is good that the developing countries have embraced the principle of a global target that they will participate in,'' Mr. Clapp said. ''It would have been better if the United States and the other G-8 countries would have been willing to step up to the plate and make a strong commitment about what they would do over the next 10 years.'' 
 Early in his presidency, Mr. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, which set emissions limits, saying the cuts would hurt the American economy and the limits did not apply to large developing countries. Since last year, he has pushed an effort to cut emissions that would include all ''major economies.''
 The meeting on Wednesday did not produce a long-term emissions goal accepted by all those countries, which was the Bush administration's aim since announcing the ''major economies'' effort in May 2007. Mr. Bush still claimed success. ''In order to address climate change, all major economies must be at the table,'' he said before returning to Washington. ''And that's what took place today.''
 For Mr. Bush, who is trying to salvage his legacy on climate change after years of international pressure to move more aggressively, the back-to-back declarations were an important step.
 ''This is an enormous movement for a man who questioned the science on global warming, who was opposed to international treaties and who was opposed to international targets,'' Mr. Clapp said. Although the meeting put the United States on record for the first time as embracing a specific long-term goal, environmentalists complained that the declaration by the Group of 8 did not go far enough. ''Major economies meeting turns into major embarrassment meeting for G-8,'' the WWF, formerly the World Wildlife Fund, said in a statement.
 Together, the countries that issued the declaration are responsible for more than 80 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions that scientists have said are warming the planet. But rich and poor nations are disputing how to set targets, and who should bear most of the responsibility.
 The starting point for the Group of 8 plan to halve emissions by 2050 is also in dispute. Advocates say the cuts should be pegged to 1990 emissions levels, but Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda of Japan said Wednesday that the starting point would be ''the recent situation.'' 
 The Group of 8 declaration did not mention a base line. But Mr. Fukuda said, ''I think we have everyone's understanding on this.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Candidates Use Iran's Missile Tests as a Chance for a Foreign Policy Debate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Sarah Wheaton contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: PORTSMOUTH, Ohio 

 BODY:
Iran's saber-rattling missile tests quickly became a flash point in the presidential election on Wednesday as Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama each seized on the tests to try to validate their differing policies on Iran.
 Each man spoke of the growing threat posed by Iran, and each called for tougher penalties against the country. But Mr. Obama called once again for pursuing what he called ''direct and aggressive diplomacy with the Iranian regime,'' while Mr. McCain warned against that approach and said that the tests highlighted the need for a missile defense system in Europe. 
 It was a classic example of how events beyond the control of campaigns can intrude into the sometimes insular debates of a presidential race. Mr. McCain had dedicated the week to campaigning on the economy, but he tends to talk about flare-ups in the Middle East to highlight his foreign policy experience. He immediately issued a statement about the tests and ended up talking about them for much of the day. 
 And Mr. Obama seemed more than happy to take up the gauntlet, arguing that the heightened tensions with Iran showed that a new approach was needed. 
 ''These missile tests demonstrate once again that we need to change our policy to deal aggressively with the threat posed by the Iranian regime,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement that called for more direct diplomacy. ''Through its nuclear program, missile capability, meddling in Iraq, support for terrorism, and threats against Israel, Iran now poses the greatest strategic challenge to the United States in the region in a generation.''
 But Mr. McCain criticized Mr. Obama for opposing an amendment branding Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization. (Mr. Obama instead co-sponsored a bill designating it as a terrorist organization, but he said the amendment that Mr. McCain supported was too provocative.) And Mr. McCain again chided Mr. Obama for saying that he would negotiate with leaders of hostile nations, including Iran, without preconditions.
 Mr. Obama later said that while he would not require preconditions before starting talks with nations like Iran and Syria, he would not necessarily grant them discussions at the presidential level. 
 At a town-hall style meeting, Mr. McCain said that he would not meet with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran unless he agreed to renounce his threatening statements against Israel. ''I'm not going to give him a forum to propound and get publicity for his nation's dedication to, quote, calling Israel a 'stinking corpse,' '' Mr. McCain said.
 The McCain campaign even appropriated language used by critics of President Bush's foreign policy to criticize Mr. Obama. Randy Scheunemann, Mr. McCain's senior foreign policy adviser, called Mr. Obama's willingness to meet with Iranian leaders ''unilateral cowboy summitry,'' a phrase with more than passing similarity to critics who view Mr. Bush's unilateral style as ''cowboy diplomacy.''
 Hari Sevugan, an Obama campaign spokesman, responded, ''With Iran now spinning 3,800 centrifuges, threatening Israel, meddling in Iraq, and funding terrorists, the current policy toward Iran that Senator McCain has fully supported is clearly failing.''
 The missile launchings came just a day after Mr. McCain joked about Iran as he visited Primanti Brothers, a Pittsburgh sandwich shop. Asked by a reporter about the rising exports of cigarettes to Iran, Mr. McCain said, ''Maybe that's a way of killing them.'' He hastened to add, ''I meant that as a joke.''

HEADLINE: Jesse Jackson Apologizes For Remarks On Obama

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Brian Stelter contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Rev. Jesse Jackson apologized on Wednesday for critical and crude comments he made about Senator Barack Obama, remarks in which he accused Mr. Obama of ''talking down to black people.''
 Mr. Jackson, before an interview with a Fox News anchor on a different topic, sharply criticized Mr. Obama for how he has been referring to African-Americans. He specifically took issue with how Mr. Obama had singled out black men in recent speeches for failing to uphold their responsibility as fathers.
 Mr. Jackson's words, which included a vulgar reference, were recorded by a live microphone on Sunday. His apology came after Fox News said it would broadcast the remarks on ''The O'Reilly Factor'' on Wednesday night. 
 ''I don't want harm nor hurt to come to this campaign,'' Mr. Jackson said in an afternoon news conference in Chicago, after his comments were referred to throughout the day on cable television. He called his words ''hurtful and wrong.''
 Mr. Jackson, who sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988, has been a supporter of Mr. Obama. He has played no formal role in the campaign, but tensions have occasionally flared behind the scenes with Mr. Jackson, who is known for his outspokenness and his penchant for drawing attention to himself.
 Mr. Obama's candidacy has served as an example of a generational and stylistic shift in black political leadership in America. The remarks drew an unusually stern rebuke from Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., Democrat of Illinois, who also serves as a national co-chairman of Mr. Obama's presidential campaign. 
 ''Reverend Jackson is my dad, and I'll always love him,'' the congressman said Wednesday evening in a statement. He added, ''I thoroughly reject and repudiate his ugly rhetoric. He should keep hope alive and any personal attacks and insults to himself.''
 In a statement issued by the campaign, Mr. Obama accepted the apology from Mr. Jackson. But a spokesman said Mr. Obama would not refrain from calling upon fathers to take greater responsibility and participate in their children's lives.
 ''As someone who grew up without a father in the home, Senator Obama has spoken and written for many years about the issue of parental responsibility, including the importance of fathers participating in their children's lives,'' said Bill Burton, a campaign spokesman. 
 Mr. Jackson made his remarks before an interview on ''Fox & Friends'' on Sunday during a segment about health care. The comments, which came when Mr. Jackson thought he was speaking privately, were brought to light on Wednesday when Bill O'Reilly, the host of ''The O'Reilly Factor,'' announced his intention to play the exchange. At least one of the words had to be blocked out.
 Mr. Jackson's comments apparently were a reaction to a speech Mr. Obama delivered on Father's Day, when he told a Chicago church congregation that ''we need fathers to recognize that responsibility doesn't just end at conception.'' Mr. Obama often tells his audiences that absentee fathers are, in part, to blame for some of the problems afflicting black Americans.
 That message prompted Mr. Jackson to accuse Mr. Obama of ''talking down to black people.'' Mr. Jackson said other issues should be highlighted, including unemployment, the mortgage crisis and the number of blacks in prison.
 In a statement, Mr. Jackson said, ''My appeal was for the moral content of his message to not only deal with the personal and moral responsibility of black males, but to deal with the collective moral responsibility of government and the public policy which would be a corrective action for the lack of good choices that often led to their irresponsibility.''

HEADLINE: Rooms to Stop the Young From Straying

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY STEVENS

 BODY:
FOR Keith and Tracy Tobias, the parents of three teenagers in La Quinta, Calif., turning an old workshop behind their house into a movie theater for their children was an obvious move. ''We're very social and our kids have grown up with that,'' Ms. Tobias said. ''We're a party family.'' In fact, the couple's reasons had to do with more than their love of fun. The Tobiases were looking for a way to keep their children at home.
''The battle lines are drawn,'' Mr. Tobias said. ''There are the parents that allow liquor under their roof and the parents that don't. That's what we're up against.'' In an era when ''everyone's texting and kids from both public and private schools in a five-town radius know what's going on,'' he added, ''it's very difficult to know every parent -- or kid, for that matter.'' For parents determined to stay on top of their children's social lives, a rec room, fitted out with a movie theater, a Ping-Pong table and a video game area, seemed an ideal solution. 
The rec room, once a wood-paneled corner of the basement with a dumpy couch and a TV with rabbit ears, is enjoying a revival in more upscale form. The space that parents cringed at the thought of entering and adolescents couldn't wait to escape has been reimagined, largely by affluent suburbanites, as a haven of home theaters, stylish furniture, stainless kitchens and spa bathrooms -- all deployed as lures to keep teenagers at home. Julia Buckingham Edelmann, a Chicago interior designer, said that over the last few years she has seen a large increase in clients who want to decorate and design spaces for their teenage children, and a concurrent decline in interest in the multipurpose great room. ''There are dedicated spaces for everything'' these days, she said -- the home gym, the home spa -- ''so it makes sense that there is the teen space.''
Luckily for parents who don't want their children to roam, teenagers seem to be more comfortable with staying at home. Ms. Edelmann speaks of the rise of a generation of teenage nesters, more HGTV than MTV. In her observation, ''kids now enjoy entertaining like their parents.'' And teenagers like the Tobiases' son Jeff and his friend and neighbor Michael Knopf, both 16, seem to agree. Both said they would rather not drive to socialize.
''I think there's been a shift in the last few years,'' Michael said. ''It's much cooler to do things at home, whether it's watch a movie, work out in a gym, or just hang out. It's just better at home.''
Alissa Quart, a journalist and author specializing in children's issues, believes this willingness to staying at home may reflect recent shifts in the way some children are brought up. ''When upper middle class young people play today, they play in a structured way that looks sort of like work,'' she said, rather than spontaneously, in a public or semipublic place.
''It makes perfect sense that teens are now encouraged to buy their home design ready-made at CB2 rather than put it together haphazardly,'' she added. And CB2 -- an offshoot of Crate and Barrel -- and other companies, like Target, Urban Outfitters and Pottery Barn, seem to be banking on a new domesticity in young people, marketing specialty lines to tweens and teenagers through custom catalogs and Web sites. According to Sarah Plamondon, a Pottery Barn spokesperson, the company's PBTeen line, which started in 2003, grew nearly 30 percent in the first quarter of this year and will open its first retail store, in Atlanta, in November. PBTeen has developed furniture with its technology-minded customer base in mind like the iChair (a $399 lounge chair with a jack for an iPod or video game system and volume controls).
''These companies market directly to the kids,'' said Kelly Kole, an interior designer with the Atlanta-area firm Kandrac & Kole. In her own work, she added, she stays away from themed decor for teenagers, ''because it can get cheesy really quickly. And I think teens don't really want anything that feels like it is contrived.''
Most of the spaces she designs for teenagers mimic adult spaces, with floor pillows and overstuffed couches -- the most common words her under-age customers use to describe their design preferences are ''low'' and ''loungy'' -- and lots of space to relax and entertain. In many of the houses in her area, she said, there is no shortage of such space, or of architectural details that make it inviting. ''Many of these rooms are still down in the basement, but they have grand entrances and sweeping staircases, so it doesn't feel like a room that no one wants to go down into.''
Ms. Kole recently designed a rec room for the Fowlers, a blended family in Atlanta-suburb Kennesaw, Ga. Beth Fowler, 44, and her husband, Hall, 47, have four teenagers between them, and when each one brings a few friends over, the numbers add up. On a not-uncommon Saturday in June, there were 22 young people in what the Fowlers refer to as their ''kid pit.''
''The nice thing is that they all hang out in their space and do what they do and we don't have to worry about where everyone is,'' Ms. Fowler said. ''There are drugs and alcohol and sex and a million other temptations out there, and I think the kids are often just as nervous as the parents are. Having a cool place to hang with friends under your own roof just makes it a little bit easier.'' Plus, she said, ''with gas prices the way they are and the price of a movie at over 10 bucks, it's also economically wise.''
That's certainly true of a rec room like the Fowlers', which Ms. Kole designed, she said, using many of the couple's existing furnishings, for about $5,000.
The Fowlers worked with Ms. Kole's firm to transform their den with a wide-screen TV, pool table, loungy furniture and a workstation with computers. ''It's so different than when I was growing up,'' said Ms. Fowler. ''I never wanted to be caught dead at home.''
Dana Cuff, a professor of architecture and urban planning at U.C.L.A., sees several factors behind teenagers' willingness to stay home. ''There is a rise in home technology, all your friends are online, and there are far fewer safe, interesting public spaces to hang out in,'' she said. ''All of these things come together, and parents start creating houses within houses for their teens.''
Parents say they are designating teenager-specific spaces not just for their children's benefit, but for their own sanity. For Peter Skarzynski, a 46-year-old management consultant in Wilmette, Ill., and his wife Caren, 45, having an area downstairs for all six of their children -- who range in age from 8 to 19 -- means having upstairs space for themselves. The Skarzynskis have just renovated their basement to feel like an English pub, with everything but a bar. ''We had so many designers come through and want to put a bar in this space,'' Ms. Skarzynski said, laughing. ''I kept having to stress that we already had that for the adults in another part of the house.''
Instead, they installed a pool table, Ping-Pong table, a Sony projector with a 100-inch screen, a popcorn machine, a PlayStation and an Xbox, and a full kitchen where the children often cook for friends. ''We have kids eating over here, sleeping over here and playing all day here,'' Ms. Skarzynski said. ''It's a priority for us to create a space where our kids can have their own friendships, their privacy and their own lives. It creates a lot less anxiety for everyone.''
Gale Goldring, a 50-year-old stay-at-home mother who lives in Pacific Palisades, Calif., with her husband Fred, an entertainment attorney, and two teenage daughters, had similar concerns in mind when she turned a garage into an indoor-outdoor cabana-style pool house.
''To be perfectly honest, it was important that my girls had their own space because I didn't want them in the house messing it up,'' she said. ''I knew it was a place that they could hang out with all their friends, swim in the pool, lounge in wet bathing suits and not completely destroy it.''
There are daybeds for sleepovers, a bath and shower and a roof deck. The budget for the project was $175,000, Ms. Goldring said, adding, ''my neighbor down the street liked the concept so much she copied it for her kids.''
Rec rooms remain where teenagers go ''to hide from us,'' said Sandy Gillis, 52. She and her husband, Tom Gammill, both writers in Altadena, Calif., dedicated part of their house's lower level to their daughter, Alice, 16, and son, Henry, 18. And though they've stocked it with a recording studio and GarageBand recording software, one thing they are not providing is Internet access. In their home, the couple is determined to keep the threats of the outside world at bay. ''It's still a safe place,'' Ms. Gillis said.

HEADLINE: NEWS ANALYSIS: After Applause Dies Down, Global Warming Talks Leave Few Concrete Goals

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Nearly everyone had something to cheer about on Wednesday after the major industrial powers and a big group of emerging nations pledged to pursue ''deep cuts'' in emissions of heat-trapping gases in coming decades.
President Bush, who had insisted that any commitment to combat global warming must involve growing economies as well as the rich nations, recruited China and India to the table and received rare accolades from some environmentalists for doing so. 
The developing countries received a promise that the rich countries would take the lead in curbing emissions. And environmentalists said the agreements renewed chances of reviving two ailing climate pacts, the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.
But behind the congratulatory speeches on Wednesday, some experts said, was a more sobering reality. The documents issued by the participating countries had very few of the concrete goals needed to keep greenhouse gases from growing at their torrid pace, they said.
The statement issued by the industrialized Group of 8 pledged to ''move toward a carbon-free society'' by seeking to cut worldwide emissions of heat-trapping gases in half by 2050. But the statement did not say whether that baseline would be emissions at 1990 levels, or the less ambitious baseline of current levels, already 25 percent higher.
Mentions of mandatory restrictions on emissions were carefully framed. Caps or taxes were endorsed where ''national circumstances'' made those acceptable. The statement urged nations to set ''midterm, aspirational goals for energy efficiency.''
There were new commitments to demonstrate that carbon dioxide from coal combustion could be captured, compressed, and stashed permanently underground. But experts have said that process would have to work at the scale of billions of tons of carbon dioxide a year within a decade or two to avert a huge rise in carbon dioxide concentrations, while proposed projects are all measured in millions of tons.
The Group of 8 statement also pledged to increase aid to help developing countries improve energy efficiency or cut their vulnerability to climate risk. But developing countries have noted that in the past those pledges have gone unfilled.
''I would characterize this outcome as 'talking the talk' rather then 'walking the walk' on climate change policy,'' said Michael E. Schlesinger, a climatologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who has co-written many papers on climate policy.
Dr. Schlesinger and others said that neither this week's statements nor the two previous climate treaties seemed likely to significantly slow the rise over decades of heat-trapping gases, most notably carbon dioxide -- an unavoidable byproduct of burning fossil fuels and forests.
Beyond any vagueness in this week's statements is the challenge that climate policy must compete with other pressing global problems, particularly rising prices for energy.
This reality was on display in Japan in the days leading up to the leaders' formal sessions. Gwyn Prins, an expert on climate policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science, was there for discussions preceding the formal talks and noted that current concerns about energy security were already clearly interfering with discussions aimed at climate stability.
One day, in particular, he said, was ''gloriously incoherent.'' At a meeting in the morning, participants focused on finding ways to reduce gas prices, he said, while a session that afternoon focused on raising them through caps or taxes on fossil fuels.
The most discouraging aspect of the statements out of Japan, for many experts, was seeing the persistent gap between what science is saying about global warming and what countries are doing.
The United States appeared to regain some credibility at the meetings, but some environmentalists still found an opportunity to criticize President Bush. David G. Victor, an expert on climate policy at Stanford University, said that the power of any American president was limited, and that another barrier to cutting emissions was Congress.
''Nearly every government is looking beyond Bush, and while they are hopeful that the next president will surely be more constructive on this issue, they don't know what the president can really bring to the table,'' he said. ''It is hard for the U.S. president to negotiate with strength when his ability to offer commitments hinges on national legislation that he does not control.''
Cutting emissions in half is just the first step in curtailing warming, climate experts have long said, because the main greenhouse gas generated by human activities, carbon dioxide, can persist for a century or more in the atmosphere, once it is released. That means that later in the century, emissions must drop nearly to zero, or large-scale techniques must be developed to pull carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere.
Making a bit of lemonade from lemons, Dr. Victor saw a bright spot in the disagreements at the meetings. ''Inability to agree is a sign that governments are actually getting serious,'' he said.
He concluded: ''People are working hard and pursuing many avenues; in time, they will find routes that work. This is quite unlike the Kyoto process, which was marked by very rapid negotiations that produced agreements that looked good on paper, but didn't really reflect what important governments, such as the U.S., could actually deliver.''

HEADLINE: Spy Cases Raise Concern on China's Intentions

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Gregg W. Bergersen was a Navy veteran who liked to gamble on occasion but spent far more time worrying about how to earn some serious money after he left his career as an analyst at the Defense Department.
At 51 and supporting a wife and a child in the Virginia suburbs, he wondered how he could get himself cast in that distinctly Washington role many Pentagon types dream of: a rewarding post-retirement perch at one of the hundreds of military-related companies that surround the capital and flourish off lucrative government contracts and contacts.
Mr. Bergersen believed he had found what he was seeking when he was introduced to Tai Shen Kuo, a native of Taiwan, who had lived in New Orleans for more than 30 years. Mr. Kuo, an entrepreneur who imported furniture from China, was active enough in civic affairs to have been named to a state advisory board on international trade. He told Mr. Bergersen that he was developing a defense consulting company.
Now, Mr. Bergersen and Mr. Kuo, along with a third accomplice, are awaiting sentencing in a federal court for their involvement in one of many cases brought in the last year involving the illegal transfer of information to China. 
The cases have intensified the evaluation in intelligence and law enforcement circles about the breadth of the threat from Beijing. Many have been similar to the one involving Mr. Bergersen, in that prosecutors describe them as carefully planned intelligence operations run by the Chinese government intended to steal national security secrets. Other cases, however, are less clear in their nature; some seem to be closer to violations of commercial export laws, with the transferred information intended to provide Chinese companies a technological benefit.
According to court papers and interviews, Mr. Kuo and his Chinese handlers ran what intelligence professionals call a ''false flag'' operation on Mr. Bergersen, a weapons systems analyst, making him believe that the information he was providing was going to Taiwan, an American ally, not Beijing.
Nonetheless, surveillance tapes made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation showed that Mr. Bergersen understood he was engaged in a serious crime.
While sitting in a rental car on July 10, 2007, Mr. Bergersen pleaded with Mr. Kuo not to tell anyone that he was the source of the information he was providing, which included anticipated American arms sales to Taiwan. ''I'd get fired for sure on that,'' he said. ''Well, not even get fired, go to [expletive] jail.''
While Mr. Bergersen may have convinced himself that the offense was attenuated because the information was going to Taiwan, the recordings show he took the risk mainly because Mr. Kuo regularly dangled a promise that he would eventually take him in as a partner in a defense consulting firm after he retired from the Pentagon and pay him $300,000 to $400,000 a year. In the meanwhile, Mr. Kuo gave him small gifts and took him to Las Vegas, where he treated him to expensive shows and paid for his wagering, all of which were observed by F.B.I. agents.
Beyond the case of Mr. Bergersen, prosecutors in the last year have brought about a dozen cases involving China's efforts to obtain military-grade accelerometers (used to make smart bombs), defense information about Taiwan, American warship technology, night-vision technology and refinements to make missiles more difficult to detect.
In interviews, current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials demonstrated uncertainty as to the precise scope of the problem of Chinese espionage. But many officials offered a similar description of the pattern of the cases: Chinese government and state-sponsored industries have relied on the Chinese diaspora -- using immigrants, students and people of second- and third-generation Chinese heritage -- and regular commercial relations to operate a system in which some people wittingly or unwittingly participate.
One senior law enforcement official involved in prosecuting such cases said the Chinese had ''a game plan of sending out lots of tiny feelers in hopes of getting back small bits of seemingly unrelated information in hopes of creating a larger picture.''
David W. Szady, who as an assistant director of the F.B.I. ran its counterintelligence division until retiring in 2006, said the Chinese had ''mastered the use of multiple redundant collection platforms'' by looking for students, delegates to conferences, relatives and researchers to gather information.
Federal investigators have come to believe, Mr. Szady said in an interview, that while the collection system may appear haphazard, even random, the Chinese ''have become very focused on what they want.''
Officials said that several other nations, notably Iran and Russia, had aggressively engaged in espionage aimed at the United States. But Joel F. Brenner, the intelligence community's top counterintelligence official, said China was by far the leading practitioner.
In an interview, Mr. Brenner described China's information-gathering efforts as ''a full-court press and relentless.'' As a result, he said, few professional analysts ''really think that what's going on is anything other than an orchestrated, deeply thought-out, strategic campaign.''
But, Mr. Brenner said, not all the information-transfer cases involving China are part of that suspected government-led espionage effort. ''Some instances are purely commercial and just involve greed,'' he said.
On the military side, Mr. Brenner said, China is especially interested in improving its naval capability against any threat from the United States and obtaining intelligence that might be important in a military confrontation in the Taiwan Strait.
In one case, he noted, China was trying to obtain technology to help its submarines run quieter and avoid detection.
One clue as to the degree of coordination of some of the operations is buried in court papers in the Bergersen case. According to one F.B.I. document, the mastermind was an unnamed Chinese government official based in both Hong Kong and Guangzhou, an industrial center formerly known as Canton. The official, identified only as ''PRC official A,'' is described by people familiar with the case as a senior Chinese intelligence official who had been a central figure in two other recent Chinese espionage operations.
PRC official A, these people said, had also helped coordinate the activities of Chi Mak, a Chinese-born engineer who was sentenced in March to more than 24 years in prison for selling naval secrets to China. The information was not classified, Mr. Mak's lawyers argued at trial, although it was illegal to provide it to China.
Mr. Brenner noted testimony showing that Mr. Mak was a ''sleeper agent'' who worked his way up in the military contracting industry, an ascent he said ''bespeaks a patience that the Chinese are especially good at.''
At the trial, prosecutors presented a ''tasking list'' from Chinese government handlers that set forth a catalog of naval information Mr. Mak was to obtain. ''You can get to know the dragon by its claw, and the list was a clear picture of the dragon's claw,'' Mr. Brenner said.
Mr. Mak and PRC official A also figure in a third major case, the one involving Dongfan Chung. Mr. Chung, a former Boeing engineer known as Greg, has been indicted on economic espionage charges -- which he denies -- for providing China with company trade secrets related to several aerospace programs, including the space shuttle.
The documents say Mr. Chung decided to spy for China partly out of patriotic sentiment. A letter from a Chinese official to Mr. Chung read in part, ''It is your honor and China's fortune that you are able to realize your wish of dedicating yourself to the service of your country.''
The appeal to ethnic loyalty raises the sensitive issue of whether the authorities have reason to be more suspicious of Chinese researchers and students. Wen Ho Lee, a former scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory was arrested in 1999 on 59 counts involving espionage and China. All but one of the charges was dropped after a judge found significant problems with the government's case.
Dr. Lee and many supporters contended that he had been unfairly singled out because of his Chinese heritage. He eventually received a settlement from the government and from several news outlets, including The New York Times, that had reported the early suspicions.
Steven W. Pelak, the export enforcement coordinator in the counterespionage section of the Justice Department, said there was an inherent protection against resorting to profiling or stereotyping. Almost all of the department's cases involving suspected Chinese espionage, Mr. Pelak said, come from companies that report a commercial inquiry or request that seems suspicious and not through surveillance because someone has Chinese heritage or connections.
It is also impracticable to keep close track of Chinese visitors to the United States, since they number about 600,000 a year, in addition to 60,000 students here at any one time. Chinese intelligence officials apparently believed that the Kuo-Bergersen channel had enough potential to assign a professional intelligence officer to live in New Orleans to act as a ''cut-out,'' or intermediary, between Mr. Kuo and PRC official A. That person was Yu Xin Kang, a 33-year-old woman who was the third accomplice charged in the case.
Mr. Kuo was provided $50,000 by his Chinese handlers, which he used largely to get close to Mr. Bergersen by paying for trips, restaurant meetings and small gifts. At one point, according to F.B.I. surveillance tapes, Mr. Bergersen recounted how his wife discovered a large wad of cash he had received from Mr. Kuo. Thinking quickly, Mr. Bergersen told her it was gambling winnings from a European trip. To his dismay, she said she was entitled to half and took it. After Mr. Bergersen related this bit of ill fortune, Mr. Kuo offered to compensate him for the difference, but Mr. Bergersen declined.
Mr. Bergersen faces up to 10 years in prison at his scheduled sentencing Friday in Alexandria, Va. Mr. Kuo and Ms. Kang, scheduled for sentencing later this summer, face life in prison.
Correction: July 15, 2008, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about cases involving the illegal transfer of sensitive information to China misstated the legal status of Dongfan Chung, a defendant in one case. Mr. Chung, a former Boeing engineer known as Greg, has been indicted on economic espionage charges, which he has denied. He has not been convicted.

HEADLINE: Billionaire Pledges $100 Million to New York State Theater

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
In years to come, when the oil-and-gas billionaire David H. Koch attends a gala performance of New York City Ballet or City Opera at Lincoln Center, the building he enters in black tie will bear his name.
Mr. Koch, recently called the wealthiest resident of New York City, has agreed to contribute $100 million toward the renovation of the New York State Theater, which is home to the two companies. His gift will be the largest private capital donation in Lincoln Center's history and a triumph in a period of growing economic uncertainty.
''They seem to like me there, and I like them, so I think we've got a deal,'' Mr. Koch, 68, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday from Boston, where he was traveling. ''Its obvious that this theater needs modernization.''
''I've been going to the New York State Theater for 40 years,'' he said. ''I can assure you, I would not make a gift of this magnitude unless I was absolutely convinced that the quality of the work was world class.'' 
Starting this fall the building will be known as the David H. Koch Theater. The change will become the second planned renaming of a New York institution for a major donor in just four months; in March the New York Public Library announced that it would name its main building after the Wall Street financier Stephen A. Schwarzman in return for a $100 million gift.
With an estimated net worth of $17 billion, Mr. Koch (pronounced coke) ranks 10th on Forbes's list of the nation's wealthiest and 37th on its list of the world's wealthiest. Based on that estimate the $100 million gift amounts to half of 1 percent of his wealth.
Reynold Levy, president of Lincoln Center, described Mr. Koch's donation as ''a very important statement about the importance and the future of performing arts in this country.'' He added, ''This gift puts the performing arts in another league of fund-raising and helps to elevate our expectations and gives us all a tremendous vote of confidence.''
Susan L. Baker, chairwoman of New York City Opera, said there was no internal opposition to the name change. ''Sometimes there are ideas that are so good and right that they just don't have a lot of resistance,'' she said. ''We all realize the value of this terrific opportunity.''
A name change was approved by the New York State Legislature in April. The theater belonged to the state until 1965, when it was turned over to the city.
Constructed at a cost of $19.3 million, the State Theater opened on April 23, 1964, at Columbus Avenue at 63rd Street, on the south end of the Lincoln Center complex. It was the second performing-arts building to open after Philharmonic Hall, now Avery Fisher Hall.
Mr. Koch will donate the money over 10 years, with an initial $15 million payment this summer, a $10 million annual payment for eight years and a final $5 million installment.
Under the arrangement the theater could be renamed for a new donor after 50 years, with members of the Koch family retaining the right of first refusal. ''A naming opportunity should be a defined length of time to allow the institution to regenerate itself with another round of major fund-raising,'' Mr. Koch said.
His donation is the lead gift in a $200 million capital campaign to enhance and update the auditorium and audience amenities of the theater.
As the first such joint undertaking of the opera and ballet, the fund-raising effort reflects progress in what has been a historically strained relationship between the companies.
''We are all working together,'' Ken Tabachnick, general manager of New York City Ballet, said. ''We are intimately in discussion on every part of this renovation.''
Sharing the hall hasn't been easy. The stage was designed at the behest of George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein, the dance company's founders, to muffle dancers' footfalls. The muted sound diminishes the opera's acoustics, which music buffs agree need improvement despite several modifications over the decades, including amplification.
For years City Opera had tried unsuccessfully to find its own home, seeking at one point to secure the performing-arts space at the World Trade Center site and later the former American Red Cross site near Lincoln Center.
Finally, with the appointment of Gerard Mortier as the future general and artistic director in March 2007, City Opera decided to remain at the State Theater after he made a strong case for staying put.
The State Theater will go dark for renovations during City Opera's 2008-9 season, but construction will be periodically suspended so the ballet can proceed with its lucrative holiday ''Nutcracker'' and then its winter and spring seasons.
The first phase of renovation, budgeted for $50 million and already under way with a completion goal of fall 2009, involves new seats and carpets, an enlarged orchestra pit with a mechanical lift, a new stage lighting system and new audiovisual and media equipment. The original Philip Johnson design for the building will be maintained.
The first phase is being financed through a mix of private and public sources. The remaining $150 million will go toward a hoped-for second phase that could include upgrading the lobby, dressing rooms and other spaces, and would bolster support for the endowment.
The city is expected to contribute to the project. Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts Inc. is exploring how much of the money raised it will match. For other constituent groups like the Film Society of Lincoln Center and Lincoln Center Theater, Lincoln Center has matched 20 percent of the first $25 million raised and 15 percent of everything over that amount.
Mr. Koch is an executive vice president and a board member of Koch Industries, based in Wichita, Kan., and owns a diverse group of companies with more than $100 billion in revenues and 80,000 employees in nearly 60 countries. The companies' brands include Stainmaster carpet, Lycra spandex, Quilted Northern tissue and Dixie cups and tabletop products.
Koch Industries, founded in 1927 by Mr. Koch's father, Fred, with a fleet of oil-delivery trucks, became the nation's largest privately held company in November 2005, when it acquired the paper maker Georgia-Pacific for $13.2 billion.
Born in Wichita, Mr. Koch earned bachelor's and master's degrees in chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to which he donated $100 million for cancer research in October.
Other charitable donations have included $20 million to the American Museum of Natural History in 2006 for the David H. Koch Dinosaur Wing. That same year he promised $20 million to Johns Hopkins University's medical campus in Baltimore, a gift that resulted in the new David H. Koch Cancer Research Building.
Mr. Koch also serves as the board chairman and chief executive of the Koch Chemical Technology Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Koch Industries, and on more than 20 nonprofit boards, including those of American Ballet Theater, the American Museum of Natural History and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
Mr. Koch's home in Aspen, Colo., famous for its New Year's Eve parties in his bachelor days, boasts trophies from big-game hunts with his father in Botswana and Mozambique. A pair of 130-pound Ugandan elephant tusks frames the dining room. He and his wife, Julia, have three children.
Mr. Koch, a major contributor to the Republican Party and supporter of conservative causes, was the vice presidential candidate on the Libertarian ticket in 1980. In 2003 he helped establish the nonprofit Americans for Prosperity Foundation, which supports free-market policies and promotes government spending limits. It split off from an earlier Koch-backed enterprise, now called FreedomWorks, which promotes similar goals.
In recent years Mr. and Mrs. Koch have become fixtures on the New York social circuit. They were honored at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's annual corporate benefit, at the Food Allergy Ball in 2005 and at the American Museum of Natural History in 2006.
His taste in real estate made news in 2006 when, seeking more space for his family, Mr. Koch sold his apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue, once owned by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and moved to 740 Park Avenue, home to business titans like Ronald S. Lauder and Mr. Schwarzman.
Mr. Koch said that he considered Mr. Schwarzman's gift to the library an inspiration. ''I admire people like that immensely -- who have great wealth but are generous in terms of supporting worthy causes,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Abu Dhabi Buys 90% Stake in Chrysler Building

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The government of Abu Dhabi bought a 90 percent stake in the Chrysler Building on Tuesday for $800 million from German real estate investors and Tishman Speyer.
 But while it might seem that the buyer, the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, got a controlling interest in the Art Deco tower, a landmark, for that kind of money, that was not the case. 
 Despite having only a 10 percent holding, Tishman Speyer Properties will continue to control the property and manage it, much as it has since 1997, because it controls the land beneath the 77-story tower, with its trademark stainless steel crown, gargoyles and elevator cabs that evoke the chrome-laden autos of the 1930s. 
 Tishman Speyer Properties and the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, an arm of the Gulf emirate government, which tends to shun publicity, did not return calls requesting comment. 
 Teresa Miller, a spokeswoman for Prudential Real Estate Investors, which managed the German fund, confirmed on Wednesday that ''we no longer own a 75 percent stake in the Chrysler Building.''
 Ms. Miller declined to disclose the fund's sale price. But real estate executives who were told about the transaction said that Tishman Speyer sold the investment council an additional 15 percent, and that the total price was $800 million. The investment council is also negotiating to buy the retail space in the seven-story glass Trylons, or pavilion, that Tishman Speyer built next to the Chrysler Building.
 Tishman Speyer and its partner, Travelers Group, bought the Chrysler Building, at 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue, and the adjoining Kent Building in 1997 for about $220 million from a consortium of banks and the estate of Jack Kent Cooke.
 Jerry I. Speyer, the chairman of Tishman Speyer, outmaneuvered competing bidders for the property by pre-emptively securing a 150-year lease with Cooper Union, which owns the land underneath the tower.
 The tower was built in 1930 by Walter P. Chrysler, the automaker, and was briefly the tallest building in New York, losing out months later to the Empire State Building. 
 The Chrysler Building's lobby featured African marble and chrome, and the Sky Club on the 66th floor offered spectacular views.
 But by the 1970s, the building was badly in need of refurbishing.
 Tishman Speyer poured $100 million into a three-year renovation, which included erecting a retail pavilion on East 42nd Street under three glass pyramids between the Chrysler Building and the 32-story Kent Building, which was not included in the sale.
 Less than four years later, Travelers sold its 75 percent stake for $300 million to the German real estate fund, TMW. ''Tishman Speyer will maintain a controlling interest and full decision-making authority'' over the building, Mr. Speyer said at the time.
 Prudential later acquired TMW and sold its share of the Chrysler Building on Tuesday. Such funds generally buy assets for five to seven years and are not interested in being long-term owners of real estate.
 Ms. Miller of Prudential Real Estate said that the fund had earned a 20 percent annual return on its investment in the Chrysler Building, the last property in that fund to be sold before it closes. 
 Last year, TMW and Tishman Speyer sold 666 Fifth Avenue, a 1.5-million-square-foot office tower, for $1.8 billion. They had bought it in 2000 for $518 million from Sumitomo Realty, a Japanese company that acquired the building in 1988 for $488.6 million.
 Japanese companies and institutions flooded into New York during the 1980s real estate boom, with Mitsubishi Estate's purchase of Rockefeller Center touching off an outcry over foreign control of American property.
 The Japanese lost a fortune after property values plunged by 50 percent during a recession in the early 1990s.
 Since 2000, German groups have been vying with Middle Eastern interests to be the top foreign investors in New York office towers, apartment buildings and hotels, according to Real Capital Analytics, a research firm. Together, they have accounted for $22 billion of the $30.2 billion invested by foreign entities over the past seven years.
 In 2001, German investors accounted for virtually all of the foreign investment in New York. But with prices escalating sharply in 2007, Middle Eastern interests spent $4.4 billion for New York property, compared with the Germans' $1.8 billion. 
 Still, with American companies like BlackRock and Apollo raising huge amounts of money from individual investors and institutions around the world, it has become difficult to determine the national origin of investment groups today, said Dan Fasulo, a managing director of Real Capital Analytics.

HEADLINE: A Growing Trophy Case

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
The hunt for the great American trophy asset is on.
The global commodities boom and the dollar's decline have unleashed a wave of big money buys of prized American assets by newly flush foreign investors.
From $100 million mansions in Palm Beach, Fla., to $23 million modern art confections, to multibillion-dollar stakes in once-venerated Wall Street banks, the number of flashy acquisitions by Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs, Qatari sheiks and large government-sponsored funds in the Middle East is growing.
And now Abu Dhabi, which already owns a 4.9 percent stake in Citigroup, has expanded its portfolio of choice American assets to include the Chrysler Building, whose thin spire and Art Deco styling make it an indelible feature of New York City's skyline. 
The government of Abu Dhabi bought a 90 percent stake in the landmark building Tuesday for $800 million from a German real estate fund managed by Prudential Real Estate Investors. The 1,046-foot (319-meter) tower was designed by William Van Alen and completed in 1930 for the Chrysler Corporation and its founder, Walter Chrysler.
The foreign purchases, especially the Chrysler investment and Middle East involvement in the recent sale of the General Motors building in New York, recall a similar financial plunge by Japanese investors into marquee American properties like Rockefeller Center and the Pebble Beach golf course in California in the early 1990s.
That foray ended badly -- many of the investments were unprofitable -- and a more insular America, just beginning to worry about its stature as a global economic power, reacted with suspicion. Now, with the dollar down more than 40 percent against the euro and the economy hamstrung by a credit crisis, a less-assured America has become increasingly reliant on foreign capital.
While there has been some scrutiny of these investments from Congress, there is also recognition that these funds, which maintain passive investment positions, will perform a crucial petrodollar recycling function.
''This is the natural outgrowth of us exporting a huge amount of dollars through high commodity prices to countries that have to reinvest it somewhere,'' said Douglas Rediker, a sovereign fund expert at the New America Foundation, a research and advocacy organization. ''These countries have to extend beyond Treasury bills, and that means equities and real estate.''
Abu Dhabi, Kuwait and other gulf countries rich with oil revenue have taken advantage of falling prices to invest in real estate and financial companies around the world. Middle Eastern investors have spent $1.8 billion this year on American commercial property, according to Real Capital Analytics, a New York property research firm.
As with the Japanese, much has been said about the losses incurred so far by these funds. Abu Dhabi's main fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, or A.D.I.A., invested $7.9 billion in Citigroup last year when the stock was trading at $31. Now Citigroup trades at $17, and while the fund still has more than two years before its bond converts into stock, Citigroup's troubles cast doubt on whether the investment will ever be profitable.
Unlike pension funds, hedge funds or mutual funds, however, sovereign funds, and in particular Abu Dhabi's, do not face any claims on their assets in the form of liabilities, redemptions or domestic investment requirements. As a result, their investment outlook is very long term in nature.
With oil hovering near $140 a barrel, analysts expect countries in the gulf to generate yearly cash surpluses of $300 billion -- Abu Dhabi's share is said to be more than $50 billion -- with sovereign funds in this area forecast to reach a size of $15 trillion by 2020.
Abu Dhabi, a producer of oil, can invest only a small portion of this surplus in its tiny economy, already plagued by inflation from aggressive government spending, and as a result has set up a series of investment funds to redeploy these assets overseas.
Traditionally the main vehicle for these investments has been the authority, a 30-year-old fund with a size that is said to be $600 billion to $700 billion.
To handle its surplus, Abu Dhabi has set up two smaller investment funds, the Mubadala Development Company and the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, or A.D.I.C., which bought the Chrysler Building stake.
Like the authority, the investment council operates behind a veil of secrecy. It does not disclose the amount it manages and gives scant detail of its investment holdings. People who follow the fund say its size could be $5 billion to $15 billion. Set up by a former executive of the authority, Khalifa al-Kindi, the fund has deployed a more nimble investment approach.
While the Chrysler Building and other assets like art may bring a form of prestige, they also appear to be holding their value better than financial institutions and the broader stock market.
In the art market, this relative strength has been tied to foreign buying. Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian steel magnate, recently bought the sculpture ''Hanging Heart'' by Jeff Koons for $23 million. In another trophy purchase, a Russian fertilizer billionaire, Dmitry Rybolovlev, bought Donald Trump's Palm Beach mansion for about $100 million.
Abu Dhabi's investment in Chrysler may have a more sober investment thesis, but it still makes for quite a bang. And for the publicity shy Al Nahyan ruling family, which for years has operated in the shadow of its more brazen neighboring emirate Dubai, the investment may signal its willingness to strut.
''This fits the broader pattern of them looking to increase their profile,'' said Brad W. Setser, a sovereign funds analyst at the Council of Foreign Relations. ''Buying an iconic building is the most visible of visible things to do.''
Correction: July 11, 2008, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the increasing appetite of foreign investors for American assets misstated the size of Abu Dhabi's newly purchased stake in the Chrysler Building. As an article in The Metro Section reported, the Abu Dhabi Investment Council bought 90 percent of the building, not 75 percent. (The council bought a 75 percent stake from an investment fund owned by Prudential Real Estate Investors and a 15 percent stake from a group led by Tishman Speyer Properties.)

HEADLINE: Officials Investigate 3 Alabama Counties in Voter Fraud Accusations

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: MARION, Ala. 

 BODY:
Federal and state authorities are looking into accusations of voting fraud in three largely black counties of Alabama, including Perry and Lowndes Counties, which played a historic role in the struggle for black voting rights in the 1960s. 
 In May, a local citizens group gathered affidavits detailing several cases in which at least one Democratic county official paid citizens for their votes, or encouraged them to vote multiple times. The affidavits were presented to state officials in Montgomery, the capital, and after the June 3 primary, the Alabama attorney general, Troy King, a Republican, seized voting records from the primary election in Bullock, Lowndes and Perry Counties.
 The United States Department of Justice posted a team of observers to monitor the primary, and the Alabama secretary of state, Beth Chapman, a Republican, reported hearing from one of the federal observers that a candidate had ''free rein'' of a polling place, where campaigning is prohibited, passing out sample ballots and instructing voters how to vote. 
 Ms. Chapman also raised questions about the possible abuse of absentee ballots. In the election on June 3, a quarter of the voters here, 1,114, cast absentee ballots, a percentage that is six times the state average and a figure that Ms. Chapman called ''astronomical.'' In Jefferson County, which includes Birmingham and has 60 times Perry County's population of 10,600, there were 365 absentee ballots. 
 Blacks hold a majority on the five-member Perry County Commission. And an influential political organization, the Perry County Civic League, founded during the civil rights movement by one of the movement's leaders, Albert Turner Sr., plays a large role in filling other offices.
 The Democracy Defense League, a biracial citizens group that has been critical of voting abuses in the area for the last three years, submitted affidavits to Mr. King and federal officials saying that some people voted six times in the same election.
 The accusations have roiled this old plantation country of rich soil, impoverished people and unremitting distrust between black majorities and white minorities, where several trials and indictments in vote fraud cases have already occurred over the years -- in 1985, 1997 and 2007 -- some of which resulted in convictions of county and city officials.
 The accusations have larger national implications at a moment when many Republican officials around the country have cited rampant voter fraud as a justification for stricter identification requirements at the polls, a move that Democrats have said is really designed to dampen the turnout among Democratic voters. Specific examples of fraud, though, are quite unusual. 
 Some Democrats here say the inquiries are motivated by racism and partisanship.
 ''The Republican Party has an unscripted mandate to target Democratic counties, and African-Americans particularly,'' said Albert Turner Jr., a county commissioner here.
 Mr. Turner's father, a local civil rights hero, was tried and acquitted on vote fraud charges 23 years ago. The younger Mr. Turner was photographed talking to voters in a polling place in the National Guard Armory throughout the day on June 3, when he was a candidate for re-election. 
 Although state law prohibits candidates from being within 30 feet of a polling place, Mr. Turner said another law allowed voters to choose someone to assist them in voting. He said he had helped as many as 60 people on primary day, when he was easily re-elected for a second term. 
 ''As long as the voter requests my help, I come in and assist them,'' Mr. Turner said. 
 Not all Democrats agree with the accusation of partisanship. 
 The Perry County district attorney, Michael W. Jackson, a Democrat and the first black to be elected to the post, called early in June for a federal investigation into possible voting irregularities, particularly focusing on absentee ballots.
 ''Just the volume, the sheer number of it,'' Mr. Jackson said in an interview. ''For there to be that many, it's suspicious. When you get the absentee ballots, it's a lot easier to pull that off, forge their names, vote for them.'' 
 He added, ''It certainly needs to be looked at, because given the historic significance of Perry County, we want to make sure candidates and the public have a fair process.''
 Mr. King did not respond to requests for comment. 
 In interviews in the county, where a third of the population lives below the poverty line and $100 is a fortune, several residents said they had seen votes openly bought and sold by local officials.
 ''I've been standing around when they come and do it,'' said Kisha Cole, who was standing with friends in a Marion neighborhood a few days ago. ''They say, 'I gotcha,' means they're going to handle you when you sign your ballot, give you $20-$30.''
 One young man, Chris Steadman, said: ''Well, yeah, I've accepted it. $100, $50. It's pretty common. Ain't no jobs around here. I know it's wrong.'' 
 In an affidavit taken by the Democracy Defense League just before the election, Christopher Collins, a 23-year-old unemployed local resident, said he had been paid by local officials to use an absentee ballot ever since he had been eligible to vote. 
 ''The last time I voted, I was paid $30,'' Mr. Collins said in a telephone interview this week, adding: ''It's pretty common. It ain't nothing new.'' 
 In his affidavit, Mr. Collins said he had been paid to vote for Mr. Turner by one of the candidate's associates. Mr. Turner responded, ''I haven't funneled any money to pay anyone for any votes.''
 With unemployment often in double digits, the struggle for political power is all the more intense, overlaid as it is by a legacy of decades of black disenfranchisement in these counties.
 The resulting tactics are often ''so bad, when you tell people what's going on, they wouldn't believe you,'' said Perry Beasley, a retired Alabama Bureau of Investigation agent who helped start the Democracy Defense League, which he says now has nearly 2,000 members. 
 The incongruity is lost on no one here. It was here in downtown Marion on a night in 1965 that an Alabama trooper flung a young local activist against a cigarette machine and then shot him in the stomach. And that killing led directly to the Voting Rights Act enfranchising blacks throughout the South. 
 Just as Alabama is gearing up to prosecute the state trooper who acknowledges having fired on the activist, Jimmie Lee Jackson, 43 years ago, federal agents came to the state last month to observe whether voting is free of fraud. 
 In an office filled with the pictures of the civil rights martyrs, Mr. Turner, a bluff, chunky man born during the movement, scoffed at the various investigations, saying they were simply a plot by Republicans to ''suppress the black vote.''
 ''I don't have no fear of Troy King,'' he said. ''Tell Dr. King to keep the dream alive.'' 
 Several white residents expressed anger at the political situation in the county.
 ''I'm to a point right now with this county and the crookedness of it, I'm ready to sell out and leave,'' Larry Warnick said as he stood outside his hardware store here. 
 Mr. Warnick's wife, Carol, added: ''You're sitting in the seat of civil rights. These people fought for it. And now their vote is being taken from them.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 1, 2008

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Thursday with an article about investigations into possible voter fraud in Alabama carried a credit that misstated the name of the photographer's newspaper. The picture was taken by John Allan Clark of the Perry County Herald, not the Perry County Record.
A picture caption on July 10 with an article about a federal inquiry into allegations of voter fraud in three largely black counties in Alabama misstated the date that Albert Turner Jr., a Perry County commissioner who is the subject of an investigation, was shown in a polling place. It was in 2006, not during an election on June 3 of this year. (Because of an editing error, the incorrect date also appeared in the article.)
 The caption also misidentified the photographer who took the series of three pictures showing Mr. Turner at various stages of the voting process. They were by Carl Crocker -- not by John Allan Clark, the editor of The Perry County Herald who supplied the photographs to The Times.

 Museums and Sites
 'GOING PLACES (DOING STUFF)' Necessity breeds invention. Also, gas is expensive, and everyone loves a road trip. Thus was born ''Going Places (Doing Stuff),'' an artist-led group bus adventure and the newest project from the Flux Factory, an alternative gallery space. Since 2002 the gallery has occupied a former air-conditioning warehouse in Long Island City, Queens. But that building was recently sold, and now Flux Factory is being evicted, said Jean Barberis, a curator there. No future site has been determined. 
 So Mr. Barberis and his team conceived a summer group show that required no space: they asked a half-dozen artists to create trips for visitors to take on a rented school bus. Adventure seekers don't know the destination; they are given only the name of the artist, the tour's title, duration and a list of supplies before they board the bus. ''We think of it as road trip as performance art,'' Mr. Barberis said. 
 The trips, which run nearly every weekend through August, are free but require reservations. So far artists have taken their charges on a tour of weird religious spaces in Staten Island; to a flea market, a blueberry farm and a home barbecue in New Jersey; to Centralia, Pa., an old mining town, above, and the Clinton Station Diner in New Jersey, which specializes in novelty burgers. (The entire group shared a 50-pounder.) 
 Camaraderie is part of the deal. ''People don't know each other when they get on the bus, and by the end people are exchanging phone numbers and making plans to see each other,'' Mr. Barberis said. On the ride home after last weekend's trip, ''half the people were completely exhausted, and the other half were having a full-on dance party with a boombox,'' he said. ''It was ridiculous.'' (There hasn't been a singalong yet, ''but we could arrange it,'' he added.) This weekend's trip is called ''Wandering Restaurant.'' It will be led by Gary Wiseman, an artist from Portland, Ore., known for staging roving public tea parties, and it is directed toward omnivores. Or people who need a really cheap vacation. (Saturday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Tours begin at the Flux Factory, 38-38 43rd Street, Long Island City. Reservations: jean@fluxfactory.org)

HEADLINE: Hard Look at Tough Times For an Italian Marriage

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Silvio Soldini's film ''Days and Clouds'' suggests that Italy's middle class is as much under siege as that of the United States. In both countries, it appears, job security isn't what it used to be, and corporate downsizing is plunging affluent families into sudden financial tailspins. 
 Michele (Antonio Albanese), the movie's tight-lipped protagonist, is a stolid businessman in Genoa whose partners, one of whom is his oldest friend, oust him from the company after 20 years. Business is business, and when it clashes with friendship, friendship goes by the wayside. 
 He is so ashamed to deliver the bad news to his wife, Elsa (Margherita Buy), an art restorer who has just earned an advanced degree, that he keeps it from her until the morning after a lavish surprise birthday party he has arranged for her. Instead of going to work for the last two months, Michele confesses, he has been spending his days on his boat, which he will have to sell along with their home. All they have left is about 21,000 euros (not quite $33,000). 
 ''Days and Clouds,'' like Mr. Soldini's 2000 film ''Bread and Tulips,'' observes a middle-aged couple in crisis. But this film -- unlike its forerunner, which was set in Venice -- is unblinkingly realistic. Genoa, with its narrow streets and quiet harbor, has none of the hallmarks of a glamorous international destination. 
 Elsa demands answers to questions any partner would ask. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Why did you waste so much money on a fancy party and an expensive birthday present? Michele explains sheepishly that he wanted them to have one last bash. 
 After weighing the offer of a job that pays half his previous salary with a boss 15 years his junior, he turns it down. When he approaches an old acquaintance to whom he lent a large sum of money years earlier, the friend lies and insists he already paid it back.
 ''Days and Clouds'' is a brave film simply for daring to portray a nightmare lurking in the minds of middle-aged workers, people who might fear a film that addresses their insecurities this bluntly. Of the few contemporary movies to take a hard look at the psychic cost of unemployment, the best is Laurent Cantet's ''Time Out.'' That melancholy 2001 film followed a downsized executive existing in a state of metaphysical self-deception, who lies to his family about his lack of a job and persuades his friends to invest in a phantom enterprise. Because the situation in ''Days and Clouds'' is more mundane, it is more threatening to contemplate.
 Initially the couple try to make the best of it. After moving to a small, noisy apartment, Michele makes the rounds of headhunters and employment agencies while Elsa suspends her unpaid work restoring centuries-old frescoes to shuttle between jobs as telemarketer and secretary. The ease with which she finds work only exacerbates her husband's humiliation.
 For a while Michele delivers parcels on a motorbike, but he quits after his 20-year-old daughter, Alice (Alba Rohrwacher), sees him making his rounds. He teams up with two low-level workers from his former company to move furniture and do painting and plastering. But as the weeks drag on, he becomes too depressed to get out of bed. During a fight Elsa calls him a spineless amoeba, and he leaves. 
 Family dynamics are a little different in Italy than in the United States. Traditional Mediterranean machismo compels Michele to put up more of a front to the world than his counterparts in America, where social mobility can be more fluid and marital roles less traditional.
 But the same crushing economic forces are at work. If you're over 50, it is increasingly difficult to regain your footing in the job market once you have lost it. The more prestigious your job, the greater the likelihood your identity is wrapped up in it. Without your work, who are you? Without his credentials and his income Michele's self-esteem begins to collapse along with his marriage. 
 What the couple endure is the ultimate test of a relationship. And Mr. Albanese and Ms. Buy, in their un-showy ways, make their characters and their deeply lived-in relationship entirely believable. Elsa's preferred work, in which she peels away one painted surface to reveal another, is a rich metaphor for the personal examination each must go through to discover if a fundamental bond exists. This sad, very grown-up movie convinces you that one does.

HEADLINE: Government Rule Makers Looking at Pensions

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

DATELINE: NORWALK, Conn. 

 BODY:
As cities and states struggle with ballooning retirement costs, accounting rule makers started an ambitious project Thursday to force state and local governments to issue better numbers and reveal the true cost of their pension promises. 
 The effort is likely to take years, and to be contentious from beginning to end. In the meantime, more places are likely to end up like Vallejo, Calif., which declared bankruptcy earlier this year after locking itself in to paying police officers and firefighters benefits so costly that they swamped the city's finances. 
 No one would knowingly create a pension plan like that. But under the current accounting rules for governments, officials can get in over their heads rather easily, without knowing it, because the current methods can understate the cost of benefits, making them look affordable even when they are not. The hidden costs can then compound over time and become crushing. 
 In a public meeting here on Thursday, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board began the project by tackling just this issue: whether the accounting rules must be changed to stop systematically undercounting pension costs. Proponents of sweeping change say the rules now give rise to bad numbers everywhere -- not just when governments are cutting corners or making mistakes, but even when the plans are run responsibly. 
 ''Mispricing is the issue,'' Jeremy Gold, an actuary and economist from New York, told the accounting board. ''Good accounting will expose the fact that this generation has borrowed from the next generation. I think that's valuable information.''
 Governments pensions typically cannot be rescinded because they are protected by law and state constitutions, even if they prove unaffordable -- hence Vallejo's bankruptcy. In some places with rising pension costs, like Illinois, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, officials are weighing sales of turnpikes, airports and parking garages to help generate cash. The problems are especially acute in places that have also promised to provide comprehensive health benefits for retirees. 
 Even mogul-studded East Hampton had to be bailed out by New York State last month after its employee benefit costs went out of control. The New York State comptroller is now auditing East Hampton's books to determine exactly what went awry. 
 But the New York State comptroller's office is also being investigated for possible pension misconduct. Until recently, the New York State pension fund used an unusual accounting method that made it look fully funded at all times, even when there were big investment losses. Although the method was allowed under the current rules, it appears to have papered over questions of whether money managers were being hired on the basis of political connections rather than expertise. The New York State comptroller is sole trustee of the pension fund. 
 A report recently prepared by the accounting board's staff shows a variety of ways in which cities and states have been losing track of their pension obligations, even as they issued detailed annual statements. The report said, for instance, that many places had given retirees retroactive pension increases without recognizing the added cost. The practice may be unsound, but the current accounting rules do not proscribe it. 
 The report also said that nearly one-fourth of large public pension plans had used ''skim funds'' -- accounting devices that allow officials to declare certain investment income to be ''excess,'' skim it out of the pension fund, and spend it on other things. Skim funds are not allowed in the private sector. 
 New Jersey and San Diego had versions of skim funds, and won ''excellence in accounting'' awards from the Government Finance Officers Association for many years while operating them. Each ended up with far less money in its pension fund than its books showed. The Securities and Exchange Commission found that San Diego had committed securities fraud by overstating the soundness of its pension fund; it is still investigating New Jersey. 
 In its report, the accounting board's staff said that such practices suggested weaknesses in the current rules, and recommended that the board address them. But the researchers also found many instances in which governments were simply breaking the rules.
 For instance, the rules now call for pension deficits to be closed over 30 years, in a process called amortization. But the researchers found that some places have begun using 50-year and even 100-year amortization schedules. Others use the required 30-year schedule, but restart the 30-year period at Year 1 every year.
 Although the G.A.S.B. can write tighter accounting rules, it has no authority to crack down on governments that go astray. Its sister rule-making body, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, writes rules for companies and is backed up by the S.E.C. 
 This question of whether government accounting is essentially flawed has become the subject of intense debate among actuaries, and the accounting board heard from outspoken proponents of each side.
 Mr. Gold told the board Thursday that traditional actuarial methods conflicted with modern economic theory, by suggesting that government pension funds can achieve high investment returns without actually bearing the associated risk. 
 Paul Angelo, an actuary from the Segal Company in San Francisco, took the opposite point of view. He said that modern pricing theories were poorly suited to measuring governmental pensions, because the theories were market-based, and while corporations may be creatures of the financial markets, governments are not. 
 Mr. Angelo also expressed concern that if the accounting rules changed, governments would feel compelled to change their pension contribution rates, and their investment practices as well. These changes are so daunting and potentially costly that some governments are likely to stop offering pensions altogether and start giving their workers inferior benefits.
 ''This is not a result to be desired,'' he said. 
 The accounting board did not indicate whether members found one or the other argument more compelling.

DANCE
 Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.
 'DANCE OUT!' New York has a proud tradition of offering outdoor performances of all kinds during the summer, but there is something about watching people dancing outdoors that feels particularly right. (Perhaps it harks back to an atavistic sense of dance as community based, at root a tribal activity.) And on Wednesday the Joyce Theater and the City Parks Foundation introduce ''Dance Out!,'' a free, five-day outdoor festival featuring three works that will be performed throughout the five boroughs. The event is part of the Joyce's 25th-anniversary celebrations, and the theater's director, Linda Shelton, should be congratulated for picking this intriguing bunch of European choreographers, fairly well known across the pond and almost never seen here. 
 Michael Schumacher, an American choreographer who has danced with the Ballet Frankfurt and Pretty Ugly and has worked closely with the theater director Peter Sellars, will perform ''Dans le Jardin,'' an improvised dance set to live music by his frequent collaborator, the cellist Alex Waterman. Dominique Boivin's Compagnie Beau Geste presents a duet for the dancer Philippe Priasso, above, and, ahem, an excavator, all performed to Callas arias. (If this sounds unlikely, bear in mind that Mr. Boivin, a French choreographer who trained with Alwin Nikolais, managed some years ago to condense the history of dance into a funny and pertinent hourlong show, ''Dance, a History My Way.'') 
 The third piece, ''Contigo,'' is by the talented Portuguese choreographer Rui Horta, working with Joao P. Pereira Dos Santos, an acrobat who specializes in the Chinese pole. Whatever that is, it sounds exciting. (Through July 20; details at joyce.org or cityparksfoundation.org.) ROSLYN SULCAS 
 AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Friday and Saturday) This weekend offers the final performances of ''Giselle,'' a work that may epitomize Romantic ballet most fully in its story of love, madness and redemption from beyond the grave. The ballet is traditionally a ballerina vehicle, but its principal male role, Prince Albrecht, is also a wonderful acting and dancing part. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, abt.org; $25 to $101. 
 (Roslyn Sulcas)
 JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Friday through Sunday; Wednesday and Thursday) America's oldest dance festival remains as eclectic as ever, with many kinds of dances in many types of dance spaces. Taking place this weekend are the final performances of Hofesh Shechter, an Israeli-born choreographer who is based in London, at the Ted Shawn Theater, and by Natural Dance Theater and Ko and Edge Company, from Japan, at the Doris Duke Studio Theater. Starting on Wednesday, Ballet Boyz, from Britain, and T.P.O. (Teatro di Piazza o d'Occasione), from Italy, perform. (Through Aug. 24). George Carter Road, Becket, Mass., (413) 243-0745, jacobspillow.org; $29 to $58.
 (Jack Anderson) 
 RISA JAROSLOW AND DANCERS (Friday, Monday and Tuesday) A new work, ''311,'' by Ms. Jaroslow is part of Sitelines, the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council's annual series of site-specific dances. Ms. Jaroslow is setting her piece under the huge archways of the city's Municipal Building, and while her dancers perform, an interviewer will ask passersby for their thoughts on city government. Those conversations will provide the only sound score (very economical). Could be interesting. At noon and 1:30 p.m., 1 Centre Street, at Chambers Street, (212) 219-9401, lmcc.net/sitelines; free. (Sulcas)
 KAYLE & COMPANY (Friday through Sunday) The choreographer Jennifer Kayle offers four pieces, including ''Heel,'' with 1,000 plastic bags: ''the landscape of a postindustrial, post-paradise fall from grace,'' according to the Joyce's Web site. That sounds about right. Her collaborators include the composers Carlos Cuellar and Burton Beerman, and the musicians Winston Choi and Maehung Xu. At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 352-3101, joyce.org; $15; $10 for students and 65+. (Sulcas)
 LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL: ROYAL BALLET OF FLANDERS (Thursday) This important Belgian company offers ''Impressing the Czar,'' in which the choreographer William Forsythe creates a kaleidoscopic journey through time, reassembling classical ballet technique in the process. (Through July 20.) At 8 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $90. (Anderson) 
 NELIDA TIRADO FLAMENCO (Thursday) This flamenco dancer and choreographer combines both traditional and modern styles. (Through July 20.) At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 352-3101, joyce.org; $25; $22 for students and 65+. 
 (Anderson) 
 PILOBOLUS(Friday, Saturday and Monday through Thursday) ''Lanterna Magica,'' a new work by the co-artistic director Michael Tracy, and ''Razor: Mirror,'' Jonathan Wolken's new quintet, will be performed this weekend. But ''Borderless Innovation,'' which continues on Tuesday, sounds like the most interesting of the three programs that the troupe is offering during its annual summer season at the Joyce. In this new piece the puppeteer Basil Twist brings shadow play into the magical Pilobolus mix, in collaboration with the choreographers Robby Barnett and Jonathan Wolken. (Through July 26.) Friday and Thursday at 8 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.; Monday through Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.; 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44. (Sulcas)
 RIVER TO RIVER FESTIVAL (Friday). This festival presents dance events at locations throughout the city. On Friday the program ''Fancy Dance Good Luck Lion'' offers a combination of Native American and Chinese dances. At 12:30 p.m., National Museum of the American Indian, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700, rivertorivernyc.com; free. (Anderson) 
 SUMMERDANZ (Friday through Thursday) This new summer series brings together a mosaic of companies and choreographers. The Zenon Dance Company, a troupe from Minneapolis, performs this weekend. The ''Emerging Artists'' program, featuring works by Camille A. Brown, Jacob Peter Kovner, Sydney Skybetter and Jessy Smith, is offered on Monday and Tuesday. And on Wednesday and Thursday, Carolyn Dorfman Dance Company honors its founder's Eastern European dance heritage with performances. Friday, Saturday and Monday through Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $25. (Anderson)

HEADLINE: Police Dept. Appeals Order To Show Street-Stop Data

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The New York Police Department is appealing an order to release an internal database of hundreds of thousands of street stops of pedestrians to civil rights advocates who want to analyze it for evidence of racial bias. 
 The city's Law Department said in court papers dated Tuesday that the order by Justice Marylin G. Diamond of State Supreme Court in Manhattan overlooked an appeals court assessment that the Police Department was not required to turn over the database because of law enforcement privilege.
 The New York Civil Liberties Union sued to gain access to the database, and in a May decision on that lawsuit, Justice Diamond said police records are ''presumptively open for public inspection.''
 She found that the Police Department had failed to show that the database should be exempt because the information was too sensitive, and ruled it should be turned over to the civil liberties group within 60 days.
 The stop-and-frisk tactics came under scrutiny after the Police Department disclosed last year that it made more than 500,000 stops in 2006 alone. Slightly more than 50 percent of the people stopped were black.
 Christopher T. Dunn, the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, called the appeal a ''stalling tactic.''
 ''It's very disappointing that the N.Y.P.D. is fighting so hard to keep the public from learning about its stop-and-frisk practices,'' he said.
 The Police Department said that during the first quarter of 2008, it stopped 145,000 people for searches, the most of any quarter since the numbers were first made public in 2002.
 The RAND Corporation, in a study commissioned by the Police Department that was released last year, concluded that the raw data ''distorts the magnitude and, at times, the existence of racially biased policing.''
 The study acknowledged that ''black pedestrians were stopped at a rate that is 50 percent greater than their representation in the residential census.'' But it claimed that the census was an unreliable benchmark because it failed to factor in variables such as a higher arrest rate and more crime-suspect descriptions involving minorities.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 16, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article by The Associated Press in some editions on Friday about the New York Police Department's decision to appeal a judge's order to release internal stop-and-frisk data on pedestrians to the New York Civil Liberties Union omitted a comment from Jesse Levine, a lawyer for the city. He said the department's database on these street stops was available to all in the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data.

HEADLINE: Longer Walk for Lattes? Starbucks Plan Resonates

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
Are there too many Starbucks outlets in New York City?
 There are, most likely, too many nationwide. Last week, the coffeehouse chain announced that it would lay off more than 12,000 employees and close some 600 stores by next March -- many of them because they were too close to another store and were siphoning off a quarter or more of the neighbor's business.
 So what does that mean for New York, where the density of stores in parts of the city has come to border on the comic since the first Starbucks opened at 87th Street and Broadway in 1994? (As a character in the 2000 movie ''Best in Show'' said of her romance: ''We met at Starbucks. Not at the same Starbucks, but we saw each other at different Starbucks across the street from each other.'') 
 There are 235 stores in the five boroughs, 185 in Manhattan alone. This comes to about eight stores per square mile on the island.
 There are two within 250 feet of each other at Astor Place, two in Rockefeller Center (ground floor and subway level), two in Macy's (mezzanine and third floor) and two down the corridor from each other at Pennsylvania Station. 
 ''It's a little crazy,'' said Amy Halperin, an artist from Maplewood, N.J., who was coming out of Starbucks Penn Station No. 1 holding a grande iced vanilla latte. Gesturing to Starbucks Penn Station No. 2 about 350 feet away, she said, ''When they opened it, I was a little surprised.'' But each Starbucks serves its own audience. Some people turn left when coming into the Penn Station hallway. Others turn right. Now each group has a Starbucks to serve it. 
 John Skelly, sitting in one of the Starbucks outlets at Astor Place with his tall iced coffee, looked out through the window at the other. ''They are popping up everywhere,'' said Mr. Skelly, who works at the Public Theater nearby. ''If it's not a Starbucks, it's a bank or a Duane Reade.'' 
 Some 250 feet away, Katherine Freeman, 21, sat in the other Starbucks and asked: ''Are people so crazed for coffee that if one is too packed, they have to go across the street? They can't wait another five minutes?''
 And Mary Malakh, sitting in the third-floor Starbucks at Macy's with a tall cappuccino, rattled off the Starbucks stores in the immediate vicinity: ''There is one on 33rd. There is one on 34th. There is one at Broadway and 37th. And there are two in here. And those are the only ones I know.''
 While Starbucks executives have not released a list of the stores to be closed, the company has said that ''all major U.S. markets'' will be affected, and has singled out California and Florida, which have been hit particularly hard by the mortgage crisis. 
 But perhaps New York, much in the way its housing market has largely been able to withstand the downdrafts of national real estate trends, also has its own Starbucks economics. 
 As Ms. Malakh pointed out, despite the high concentration of Starbucks stores she listed in or near Herald Square, ''no matter which one you go to, they always have a huge line.'' 
 ''New York has always been a unique market,'' Taylor Clark, author of ''Starbucked'' (Little, Brown, 2007), said in an interview. ''The ideal version of Starbucks, which involves a lot of walking traffic, is built for cities like New York: You've got such giant masses of people walking by, all of which need coffees, given the pace of life.''
 Lesly Madera, 18, who was drinking a grande caramel Frappucino after his shift at one of the Astor Place stores, said that though it seemed ''kind of crazy having so many Starbucks close together,'' the company placed stores where ''they were needed.'' 
 Mr. Madera, who said he intended to quit in two weeks, added that ''Astor Place is overwhelmed by the numbers.''
 Starbucks executives have said that they were concerned less about the distance between stores than the number of customers that each store draws. And New York is the most tightly packed urban area in the country, with a caffeine-fueled lifestyle (though the appetite for $4 lattes may ebb if the economy deteriorates further).
 Mark Malkoff, a comedian who visited all 171 Starbucks outlets then in Manhattan in a 24-hour period for a short film last summer, observed in an interview: ''There were five stores open 24 hours a day -- that's just so a New Yorker can wake up at 3 or 4 a.m. and say, 'I need my fix,' and they can go to Starbucks.''
 Notably, there are no other major coffee chains in New York City. No Caribou Coffee. No Tim Hortons. No Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. No Peet's Coffee. (Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's, though not coffee chains, have both jumped into the latte market in New York.) 
 Despite the concentration of stores in southern and central Manhattan, there is a lot of untapped territory elsewhere in the city. Starbucks is still expanding in Harlem and just opened its first store in Jackson Heights, Queens. There are only five stores in the Bronx.
 And New York does not have the record for the two closest Starbucks outlets, Mr. Clark said. Those two are in Portland, Ore., and are 15 to 20 feet apart. 
 How is that possible? They are both in a mall, he said: one on the first floor and another directly above on the third, with only the second floor separating them.

HEADLINE: In Deepening Ad Decline, Sales Fall 8% At Magazines

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
As the economy stumbled in the second quarter, magazine ad sales fell more than 8 percent, with the steepest drops in ads for vehicles and for computers and related equipment, according to a report released Thursday. 
 The report, compiled by the Publishers Information Bureau, shows the industry's troubles growing worse. Ad pages sold in magazines in the United States declined slightly last year, 0.8 percent, then fell 6.4 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the period a year earlier, and 8.2 percent in the second quarter.
 For the first six months of the year, automotive ad pages in magazines were down 21.3 percent and technology ad pages fell 17.5 percent.
 There are no reliable, industrywide figures on magazine ad revenue because the publicly reported numbers do not reflect discounts to advertisers, which tend to be deeper in tough times.
 Magazines continue to do significantly better than newspapers. Ad revenue at newspapers fell nearly 8 percent last year and is headed toward a decline of at least 10 percent this year.
 Analysts and industry executives say that although the cyclical economic forces are similar, magazines so far have not been seriously hurt by the shift of readers and advertisers to the Internet, as newspapers have. Magazines also do not rely on the small classified ads that have had the sharpest drop at newspapers.
 Ads for luxury goods and services are faring best, as they have for years. Ad pages increased in a number of high-end fashion, home decor and travel magazines, like Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, Architectural Digest and National Geographic Traveler, while several others stayed roughly even.
 ''The joke here is, 'Flat is the new up,' '' said Thomas J. Wallace, editorial director at Conde Nast.
 But news magazines and some business magazines were battered by the ad slump. Ad pages dropped 21.1 percent at Time magazine over the first half of the year, 22.4 percent at Newsweek, 14.8 percent at BusinessWeek, 12.6 percent at Forbes and 12.2 percent at The Week, according to the bureau's report.
 Some of the biggest-circulation magazines, including several women's magazines, were among the hardest-hit; Reader's Digest, Cosmopolitan, Ladies' Home Journal and Family Circle each lost more than 14 percent of their ad pages, and AARP magazine lost more than 20 percent.
 Some categories fared much better, with most ranging from modest declines to healthy gains, including the major men's, ''shelter'' and celebrity magazines.
 And even in the troubled categories, there were some success stories, like Fortune and The Economist, which posted small gains.

HEADLINE: Old Port Town's Appeal Reaches Beyond Northwest

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PREUSCH

 BODY:
JEANNE and Kevin Clark bought a vacation home in Nevada City, Calif., about 20 years ago. They had planned to relocate to Nevada City, a historic gold-rush town northeast of Sacramento, after their careers as high school teachers in Southern California.
 But when they visited their former hideaway a few years ago, they realized it had become too smoggy and too overcome by traffic, not the quaint town they had originally bought into.
 ''So we went looking for another place, and we looked all around between Anacortes and Port Angeles'' on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, Kevin Clark said. ''We decided Port Townsend was the best place in the whole area.''
 They were charmed by the town's red-brick waterfront, where ferries drop visitors from across Puget Sound; its vibrant cultural scene in a small-town package; and the mild climate. Smitten, they bought a 2,900-square-foot contemporary with cathedral ceilings and hardwood floors in a residential part of the historic port community in 2002 for $384,000, and they have spent summers and holidays there ever since. ''We just love it here, and we don't think there is a better place in the Northwest in terms of amenities,'' Mr. Clark said. 
 Traditionally a weekend getaway for Seattle residents, the region now attracts part-timers from Chicago, Washington, Texas and even Western Europe. Most are liberal-minded, middle-age couples, many with retirement on their minds, who are drawn to the city's keen sense of history and its range of cultural offerings.
 ''It's generally empty nesters and people who want to be involved in the community,'' Michelle Sandoval, mayor of Port Townsend and co-owner of Windermere Real Estate Port Townsend, said of those who buy second homes there. ''They don't want to be anonymous. They want to be engaged.''
 Many second-homers are nautical by nature, drawn to the region's sea kayaking, sailing and craft maritime industry as epitomized by the Wooden Boat Foundation. 
 The Scene
 Once a Victorian-era seaport, Port Townsend sits at the northeastern tip of the Olympic Peninsula on a dogleg called Quimper Peninsula. To the north is the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the entrance to Puget Sound, whose waters are home to islands that fill the eastern horizon.
 Port Townsend was the first white settlement on the Olympic Peninsula, and its sheltered harbor became a center for the sea trade that defined the region's early history. Port Townsend once considered itself the ''New York of the West,'' but it was bitten by hard times when the railroad passed it by in the late 1800s. After the financial panic of 1893, the population dropped from 7,000 to less than 2,000, according to Historylink.org, an encyclopedia of Washington State history. It was reborn as a paper-mill town in the 1920s, and has evolved into an arts-focused tourist town with a strong maritime heart.
 ''It's very eclectic,'' said Renee Klein of Seattle, who, with her husband, Jim, enjoys spending her weekends walking around town. The Kleins bought a 1950s three-bedroom house in the Morgan Hill neighborhood in 2003 for $315,000.
 ''The kind of dialogues you have at a cocktail or dinner party would rival anything you might find in a big city,'' Ms. Klein added.
 But the town certainly isn't all rarefied conversation. After work, shipwrights shell peanuts as they quaff pints of Hop Diggity I.P.A. ($4.25 a pint) at the Port Townsend Brewery's taproom, right beside wooden boats up on blocks in the industrial park.
 On the waterfront, cormorants and gulls sun themselves on pitch-sticky pilings, and though there are a number of tacky trinket shops, the place is still authentic enough that a white captain's hat can be worn without irony. And the bygone glory is as palpable as the grooves worn into the floor in front of the tellers' windows at the imposing Romanesque post office and customs house that overlooks the harbor.
 The wise don't waste the sunshine when it arrives, working their vegetable gardens or heading into the nearby Olympic National Forest and Olympic National Park.
 The city has for decades attracted artists and other creative types from Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area, and today Centrum, a nonprofit arts association formed in 1973, hosts writers' conferences, jazz concerts and fiddle workshops at nearby Fort Worden State Park. Port Townsend is also home to Copper Canyon Press, considered one of the country's best publishers of poetry, and its writers include W. S. Merwin, Jim Harrison and Ted Kooser.
 The ample arts offerings and dozens of restaurants mean transplants from cities don't feel like cultural pioneers anymore, which has also made the city more popular with retirees. One downside for all of those Left Coasters -- it can be almost easy to forget which gray Prius is yours in the parking lot of the Food Co-op Port Townsend.
 ''We all joke that we're sort of left-over hippies,'' Ms. Klein said.
 Pros
 Sitting in the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains, Port Townsend gets about half the annual rainfall of Seattle, about 19 inches. But because it comes in small doses, winters can still seem gray and endless. On the plus side: ''You never need snow tires, and you never need an air-conditioner,'' said Jerry Hutter, who with his wife, Kc, bought a 3,700-square-foot custom-built house on five acres south of town for $650,000 in 2004. 
 Cons
 Often the first thing you notice after the inland waterway vistas is the ripe wind wafting across the waterfront from the Port Townsend Paper Corporation's mill, which is the county's largest private employer.
 Much of old town is a National Historic Landmark District, which serves to maintain its character but can be cumbersome to homeowners hoping to remodel protected homes. If you can get the permits, options are limited for contractors, and newcomers might be surprised by the easygoing nature of those who are there. ''We call it P.T. time,'' Ms. Sandoval said. ''People work when they want to work.''
 The Real Estate Market
 About 20 percent of the homes in Port Townsend are vacation properties, said Lynda Constantine of Countrywide Home Loans. ''It used to be a lot less,'' she said. Most newcomers are looking for a home in the uptown area, preferably one of the many Victorian-style homes, where they can walk to coffee and a pastry at Sweet Laurette or fill their bike baskets with artisan foods from Aldrich's Grocery.
 While $350,000 can still get a three-bedroom, two-bath cottage, it will probably be a home that needs some work. The median sale price of single-family homes jumped by more than 40 percent between 2004 and 2007, from $247,000 to $350,000, according to the Northwest Multiple Listing Service. But in the first three months of 2008 the median sale price dipped to $332,000.
 In addition, ''the condo market has really stalled,'' Ms. Sandoval said. 
 For $1 million up, it's possible to buy an estate of a few acres in the timber with views of the sound or the strait. But isolation with a view isn't the hottest commodity, and it is rare. ''We don't have luxury homes, for the most part,'' Ms. Sandoval said. ''They have to be built.''
 LAY OF THE LAND
 POPULATION 9,134, according to a 2006 Census Bureau estimate.
 SIZE The city center is about a mile square, but homes can be found all across the three-mile-wide peninsula.
 WHERE Port Townsend is two hours northwest of Seattle, including a half-hour ferry ride.
 WHO'S BUYING Professionals in their 40s, 50s and 60s, mostly from the West Coast.
 WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING At the Victorian-era Palace Hotel (1004 Water Street, 360-385-0773; www.palacehotelpt.com), rooms range from $79 to $189 a night, and are named after prostitutes who are said to have once worked there.

HEADLINE: Minimum Wage Increases Faster Than Median Wage

BYLINE: By PATRICK MCGEEHAN

 BODY:
In the last few years, the minimum wage in New York State has increased almost 40 percent, while the average pay for hourly workers has risen much more slowly, not even keeping pace with inflation, according to a report released Thursday by the federal Department of Labor.
 The median wage paid to the 4.1 million hourly workers in the state was $12.03 last year, meaning that more than two million New Yorkers earned less than that, the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. That was about equal to the median national hourly wage of $11.95 -- about $25,000 a year for a 40-hour work week. 
 ''It used to be that median wages were higher in New York,'' said James Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute in Manhattan. The long, steep decline of the state's manufacturing base narrowed the gap, Mr. Parrott said, adding that ''a lot of our job growth has been at the low end of the wage spectrum.''
 At the state's minimum wage of $7.15 an hour, a full-time worker would earn less than $15,000 a year. Still, that is much more than the state's lowest-paid workers made before the Legislature raised the minimum wage in three steps starting in 2005. Before then, the state minimum wage was the same as the federal, $5.15 an hour.
 The state's minimum wage rose to $6 an hour on Jan. 1, 2005, then to $6.75 a year later and to $7.15 on Jan. 1, 2007. Those increases amounted to a 39 percent raise in 24 months. 
 Many employers opposed those increases, arguing that they would push up the wages of all workers. 
 ''There is generally this feeling that when you do increase the minimum wage, it creates upward pressure on the rest of your work force,'' said Michael J. Elmendorf II, the New York director of the National Federation of Independent Businesses in Albany. ''A lot of workers feel like they should be getting something out of it.''
 Judging by the Labor Department's report, many did not. The median wage of hourly workers in the state rose just 93 cents an hour, or 8.4 percent, between 2003 and 2007, according to the report. The buying power of that wage, adjusted for the rate of inflation in the New York City metropolitan area, declined by about 2 percent.
 Mr. Parrott said wage increases had been significantly higher in the last few years for the lowest-paid 10 percent of the state's workers than for those making more. He said that workers who were earning as much as $1 to $2 more per hour than the minimum wage probably benefited, but that most other hourly workers would not have been affected.
 The Fiscal Policy Institute supported a bill in the State Assembly during the last legislative session that would have raised the minimum wage to $8.25 an hour over the next three years. After that, the minimum wage would have increased in step with inflation.
 At $8.25 an hour in 2011, the state's minimum wage would still have 13 percent less purchasing power than it had at its peak in 1970, according to a new report released on Thursday by the Fiscal Policy Institute. The institute said it would prefer to see the minimum wage raised to $9.50, restoring it to the inflation-adjusted value it had in 1970. That change would raise the wages of 1.2 million New Yorkers, the institute estimated.
 The bill, which Mr. Elmendorf's federation strongly opposed, did not pass, so the state's minimum wage is not scheduled for another increase. The federal minimum wage will rise to $6.55 this month and to $7.25 in July 2009. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 15, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in some editions on Friday about a government report showing a slower pace of wage increases for hourly workers in New York State over the last few years compared with the rise in the minimum wage misidentified, in one reference, the measure of overall wages that was cited. It was the median -- not the average -- hourly wage.

HEADLINE: Leaders of Actors' Union Call Final Offer Unacceptable

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Leaders of the Screen Actors Guild declined a final offer for a new labor contract late Thursday, prompting an alliance of Hollywood production companies to demand that the union put the offer before its entire membership for a vote.
 ''Any further delay in reaching a reasonable and comprehensive agreement does a disservice to the thousands of working people of our industry who are already being seriously harmed by the ever-worsening de facto strike,'' the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers said in a statement. 
 S.A.G., Hollywood's dominant actors' union with some 120,000 members, has been embroiled in increasingly rancorous negotiations with television and movie producers over a new contract since spring. Worried about a potential strike, studios have slowed production, particularly on movies, to a near halt until the matter is resolved, leading to what many refer to as a de facto strike. 
 On Tuesday, guild leaders declared what producers called their final contract offer unacceptable and offered a set of counterproposals. The guild agreed to accept some elements of the offer -- including modestly higher health and pension contributions -- but dug in their heels several larger issues. For instance, S.A.G. remains insistent on higher residual payments for DVD sales.
 The producers' alliance, according to people inside the five-hour series of meetings, responded by saying the offer on the table was not subject to negotiation. No new talks are scheduled. The session ended with S.A.G. saying it would hold internal meetings on Friday and contact producers with hopes of keeping talks alive.
 Alan Rosenberg, the guild's president, rejected the call for a unionwide vote.
 ''Our negotiating committee to a person, including representatives from across the country, does not believe this deal is acceptable,'' he said in an interview. ''When we put something in front of members, I want to make sure it's something they can live with.''
 Producers gave S.A.G. the offer on June 30, the day before the previous contract expired. The offer, according to producers, was on par with what four other Hollywood unions received and would deliver $250 million in additional compensation to actors over its three-year run.
 Among the improvements, producers say, is a 2.5 percent increase in salary for guest stars in television and a 10 percent increase in wages over the course of the contract. The offer establishes residual payments for made-for-new-media content and the streaming of television shows and movies.
 But the offer does not include an increase in DVD residuals. None of the other four unions got such an increase, but S.A.G. leaders say the point is crucial to them. It also does not go as far as S.A.G. wants in preserving actors' consent over the use of video clips of their work online.
 Both sides have ratcheted up rhetoric in recent days. In a radio interview on Wednesday, Mr. Rosenberg called the most recent offer from producers ''inadequate and frightening.'' The producers' alliance sent a letter to 120 California legislators blaming S.A.G. for bringing Hollywood to a standstill and pointing out the economic damage a strike would cause.
 The producers' alliance also increased pressure on S.A.G. to make a deal by making public a timing clause attached to its offer. If S.A.G.'s membership ratified a new agreement by Aug. 15, producers said they would make the improved pay retroactive to July 1, the day the previous contract expired. If the August date passed, wage increases would not go into effect until ratification.
 Producers do not want actors to keep negotiations plodding into September, when the Emmy Awards could give the guild additional leverage. Last winter, screenwriters' unions successfully used a boycott of the Golden Globe Awards and a threatened boycott of the Academy Awards in their bid for an improved contract.
 Members of a smaller, rival actors' union on Tuesday approved a new contract with Hollywood's major production companies. Leaders of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists said 62.4 percent of the voting members were in favor of the deal. It would not reveal the vote tally, citing longstanding practice.
 That percentage, while a solid win for Aftra, was interpreted by S.A.G. board members in sharply different ways. A more militant group saw the margin -- low by historical measures -- as an indication that actors backed S.A.G. in its fight for a contract with significantly better terms. Other board members argued that the margin supported the opposite view.

HEADLINE: The Taliban's Rising Tide

 BODY:
The swelling forces of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters in Pakistan's border region pose a grave threat to American and NATO troops in Afghanistan. They also pose a grave threat to the Pakistani people. Pakistan's Taliban militias, like their Afghan counterparts, are trying to impose their harsh medieval version of Islamic law. More than a thousand Pakistanis have been killed in terrorist attacks in the past year, mostly in the border areas where radical Islamic fighters are strongest. 
 Pakistan's new military and civilian leaders, caught up in their own power struggles, have been dangerously derelict in acknowledging and confronting the threat. Instead, they have deluded themselves that they can negotiate a separate peace with fanatic Taliban leaders. Bitter experience has proved that will not work. 
 Sending United States troops into Pakistan's border regions to try to clean out Taliban and Al Qaeda forces is also not the answer -- and would provoke even fiercer anti-American furies across Pakistan. The poorly paid, ill-trained and uncertainly loyal Frontier Corps in Pakistan is not up to the job.
 Pakistan's civilian leaders and the new military commander, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, will need to commit to fighting the extremists -- for the sake of their own country's stability -- and to sending in elite units specifically trained in counterinsurgency techniques. Local tribal leaders also need to be weaned away from the Taliban. That would only happen if Islamabad and Washington back their exhortations with substantial economic assistance. 
 The United States has showered Pakistan with more than $7 billion in military aid over the past six years, with little of it actually being used for counterinsurgency purposes. Over the same period, Washington has provided less than $3 billion in all other forms of assistance. 
 This month, Senators Joseph Biden and Richard Lugar plan to introduce sensible legislation that would provide up to $15 billion in aid to Pakistan over the next 10 years for economic development, health and education. Congress should move quickly to approve the aid.
 The United States also needs to work with Pakistan's new government to establish spending priorities and to ensure that any future aid is channeled in ways that would strengthen the civilian government and allow it to regain control over a military that has too often been a law unto itself and intelligence services that seem far more loyal to the extremists than their own government. 
 When Pakistan's prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, visits Washington later this month, President Bush should offer him strong political and economic backing in exchange for a firm commitment to support Afghanistan's embattled government and fight Taliban and Al Qaeda terrorism in Pakistan. 
 Washington has made a lot of policy mistakes in Pakistan -- most notably supporting Pervez Musharraf for far too long. It has forfeited most of its credibility with the Pakistani people and reinforced their belief that the fight against extremism is ''Washington's war'' and not also their own. 
 Both countries have a common and increasingly urgent interest in rolling back the power of Al Qaeda and the Taliban and working together to promote democracy and development in Pakistan. President Bush needs to persuade Pakistan's leaders of that -- and he needs to do it now, before Al Qaeda and the Taliban get any stronger.

In 1967, I asked him what firm I could go to so that I would be paid an equal salary to what men were being paid. He first said don't be ridiculous, and then advised me to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and work for myself. On December 28, 2007, he joined me on the podium as I rang the ''Closing Bell'' at the NYSE in celebration of my 40th anniversary. Jerry gave me this brilliant idea, and I have always given him the credit for being the Inspiration behind my success. I will miss Jerry -he was a unique and very special person. Muriel ''Mickie'' Siebert TSAI--Gerald, Jr., 79, resident of Manhattan and Rye, NY, died peacefully July 9, 2008. Beloved father of Christopher and Veronica. Caring grandfather of Vanessa O'Brien. Jerry was an enormously talented and successful businessman, serving as a Chairman, President and Chief Executive officer of several large publicly traded companies. He was known as a highly gifted analytical problem solver and a skilled negotiator. His understanding of the capital markets was unparalleled, recognizing opportunities where others saw confusion. Jerry was born in Shanghai, China, on March 10, 1929, and attended St. John's Middle School and St. John's University. He came to the United States in 1947 and, after one semester at Wesleyan University, transferred to Boston University, where he earned both a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the College of Liberal Arts and a Master of Arts in Economics from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1949. In addition, Jerry attended courses at the School of Management. Jerry began his distinguished investment career in 1951 as a security analyst at Bache & Company. A year later, he joined the Boston firm of Fidelity Management and Research Company, Inc., as a security analyst. After only six years, at the age of 29, he started the Fidelity Capital Fund, Fidelity's first public growth fund. He has been credited as one of the main initiators of the modern performance fund idea. At Fidelity he rapidly rose through the corporate ranks, ascending to Assistant Vice President of Fidelity Fund, Inc., to Vice President, to director and Executive Vice President of the company in 1963. In 1965, Jerry established the Tsai Management & Research Corporation and Manhattan Fund, which proved to be a huge success. The initial offering was planned for $25 million but the public's response was so enthusiastic that the fund was greatly oversubscribed and $247 million in shares were sold. He joined CNA Financial Corp in 1967 as President and served until 1973. Jerry was also Chairman of Associated Madison Companies, lnc., the cornerstone of Primerica's financial services business, He joined Primerica Corporation, then American Can Company, as Executive Vice President of financial services and as a member of the company's Board of Directors in 1982, when the company acquired Associated Madison in its first move into the financial services industry. He rose to Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, becoming the first ChineseAmerican to lead a company in the Dow Jones Industrials Index. He became the principal strategist in building Primerica's financial services businesses, which included the purchase of Smith Barney in 1987. Jerry was a devoted son, and regularly sought out his mother's advice before making a major business decision. For instance, Ruth encouraged him to join Primerica, despite his reservations, and then backed his idea of acquiring Smith Barney. He often said that her faith in him have gave him the confidence to succeed. From 1993 to 1997, he served as Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Delta Life Corporation, a life insurance; and annuity company.

HEADLINE: Shares of Lehman Take a Beating as Anxiety Builds in the Mortgage Market

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Lehman Brothers, Wall Street's favorite punching bag, took another beating on Thursday as jittery investors fretted over problems at home-loan giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and absorbed regulators' statements that they would not bail out all financial institutions. 
 Shares of Lehman fell 12 percent, to $17.30. This year, it has lost 70 percent of its value, while a broader index of broker-dealer stocks is down 33 percent. 
 The cost of insuring Lehman's senior unsecured debt, a barometer keenly watched by traders, reached its highest levels on Thursday since the Bear Stearns collapse in March.
 Over all, major stock indexes fell less than 1 percent, with Freddie Mac the big loser with a 22 percent decline and Fannie Mae's shares down about 14 percent.
 Lehman, once a leader in the now-battered mortgage market, is struggling against a tide of rumors, none substantiated but all magnified by fears about the true value of its assets that cannot be easily sold and the bleak prospects for its business in a weak economy. 
 ''There's not a lot of good news in the market,'' said Brad Hintz, a securities analyst industry at Sanford C. Bernstein. 
 Lehman does not appear to face any immediate financing issues and has access to an emergency loan program installed by the Federal Reserve in March. ''With the Fed behind them, they will survive,'' Mr. Hintz said. 
 The program, known as the primary dealer credit facility, has expanded Fed lending beyond the commercial banks normally served and was scheduled to expire in September.
 This week, though, the chairman of the Federal Reserve said he was considering an extension of that program into next year, good news for Wall Street firms continuing to navigate a torrent of bad news. The financial sector is frozen, the economy is slowing and the housing market is plagued by the triple whammy of rising foreclosures, a paralyzed securitization market and escalating fears about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which own or guarantee about $5 trillion in mortgages. 
 The crisis in financial markets has been accompanied by higher gas and food prices that have put the Fed in a tough position: it must encourage lending to keep the wheels of finance turning but also be careful to temper inflation, an economic threat rising with oil and food prices. And the Fed must walk the line between comforting Wall Street -- not the most popular idea among Americans struggling to stay afloat themselves -- by possibly extending the emergency loan program and reassuring the markets that it will not bail out every financial institution that runs into trouble. 
 ''For market discipline to be effective, market participants must not expect that lending from the Fed, or any other government support, is readily available,'' Henry M. Paulson Jr., secretary of the Treasury, said before a Congressional hearing Thursday. ''For market discipline to effectively constrain risk, financial institutions must be allowed to fail.''
 This year the Fed and the Treasury played a critical role in orchestrating JPMorgan Chase's takeover of Bear Stearns after the investment bank came to the brink of bankruptcy. 
 Like Bear before it, Lehman has been battered by an almost daily dose of market rumors. Thursday's batch included speculation that Pimco, the giant California-based bond fund, and SAC Capital, a large hedge fund, had stopped doing business with Lehman. Representatives for both Pimco and SAC said the rumors were not true and that they continued to do business with Lehman. 
 ''The shorts are going after anyone who is levered and doesn't have an exit plan,'' said one senior trader who is not authorized to speak for his institution. 
 Lehman Brothers and other Wall Street institutions have accused short sellers, those who profit on a share price falling, of feeding misinformation into the market to create a crisis of confidence. Such activity would be a violation of federal securities laws. 
 Short sellers argue that the firms are teetering on their own bad decisions, including loading up their balance sheets with risky assets acquired with heavy borrowing and without sufficient equity. 
 Both arguments seem to have merit: Wall Street got itself into a pickle when it piled into risky assets financed with cheap debt. And the marketplace is filled with rumors that never quite pan out, with Lehman being the latest topic. 
 The results are unambiguous. The stock has been battered and cost of buying protection again a Lehman default has risen. The cost of buying $10 million worth of insurance against Lehman's senior unsecured debt spiked to $326,000, from $280,000, according to Tim Backshall, chief strategist for Credit Derivatives Research. He said the spike was caused by ''rumors that a number of clients were halting trading,'' he said. 
 The spreads on Lehman's credit default swaps widened to their March level.
 ''It's the widest it's been since the Bear weekend and excluding that, it's the widest ever,'' Mr. Backshall said. ''It's not pretty.''

HEADLINE: Britain Leaves Interest Rate at 5%

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
The Bank of England, seeking to maneuver between accelerating inflation and a slowing economy, left its main interest rate target unchanged at 5 percent on Thursday. 
 Mervyn King and his colleagues on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee made no statement after their meeting. 
 ''At this point in the cycle we believe it is correct to err on the side of caution with regard to inflation and leave rates unchanged,'' Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, told Reuters. The policy committee ''is acutely aware that if the inflation genie escapes from the bottle, it will be very hard to put it back in again.''
 ''We do not want to get ourselves into a situation whereby interest rates are cut now only to be reversed with a large increase later this year or next,'' he said. ''Those calling for interest rate cuts now need to be aware that such a policy could result in the recession we are all trying to avoid.''
 With food and fuel costs climbing, inflation rose at a 3.3 percent annual rate in May. That was above the 3 percent upper limit of the central bank's comfort zone and a level that required Mr. King to send a public letter of explanation to Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the Exchequer.
 Like the United States and Spain, Britain is in a severe housing market slump. Home prices fell 6.1 percent in June compared with June a year earlier, a report from Halifax, a mortgage lender, showed Thursday. That returned average prices to a level last seen in August 2006. House prices fell 2 percent in June from May.

PERSON: Gerald Tsai 

HEADLINE: Gerald Tsai, 79, Innovative Investor, Dies

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
Gerald Tsai Jr., a fund manager and financier who pioneered the creation of performance funds in the 1950s and '60s and later turned a canning company into the financial services giant Primerica, died Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 79.
 The cause was multiple organ failure, said his son Christopher. 
 Primerica and a subsidiary Mr. Tsai once led eventually became building blocks of Citigroup. But Mr. Tsai was perhaps most famous for his skill in building mutual funds. 
 He was not yet 30 when he started Fidelity Investments' first aggressive growth fund in 1958, riding it to great success and a large personal fortune. Mr. Tsai spurred the popularity of ''momentum investing,'' as his funds swiftly moved money from one hot growth stock to another. He joined the Fidelity Management and Research Company in 1952 as a security analyst and, six years later, at the age of 29, started the company's first aggressive growth fund. By 1963, he was an executive vice president.
 At Fidelity, Mr. Tsai ''showed himself to be a shrewd and decisive picker of stocks for short-term appreciation,'' John Brooks wrote in the book ''The Go-Go Years: The Drama and Crashing Finale of Wall Street's Bullish 60s'' in 1973. ''So swift and nimble in getting into and out of specific stocks that his relations with them, far from resembling a marriage or even a companionate marriage, were more often like that of a roue with a chorus line.''
 Mr. Tsai's skills as the manager of performance-oriented mutual funds became legendary. In 1965, with the encouragement of his mother, Ruth, Mr. Tsai established the Manhattan Fund, a mutual fund that won him widespread attention. When the fund first offered shares, a modest offering of 2.5 million shares quickly ballooned to a total of 27 million, bringing the fund $247 million in capital and representing what was at the time the biggest offering in investment company history.
 Mr. Tsai knew when to buy, and more importantly, when to sell. In 1968, he sold the fund to the CNA Financial Corporation, just as its stellar success -- and the bull market that it rode -- were starting to wane. Reports at the time said he walked away $30 million richer. 
 In the 1980s, Mr. Tsai injected energy into the American Can Company, a container production and food packaging business, which was starting to shift toward the more lucrative financial-services sector. American Can in 1982 bought the Associated Madison Companies, a life insurance company where Mr. Tsai had been chairman; he was named executive vice president of financial services. By 1987, when the company changed its name to Primerica to reflect its financial focus, Mr. Tsai was the chief executive, making him the first Chinese-American to lead a Dow Jones industrials company. 
 A year later, Primerica and Commercial Credit Group, headed by Sanford I. Weill and including the firm that later became known as Citi Smith Barney, were combined in a $1.65 billion deal. Mr. Tsai remained the largest shareholder but handed day-to-day management to Mr. Weill.
 In 1993, he re-entered the insurance industry, becoming the chief executive of the Delta Life Corporation.
 Gerald Tsai Jr. was born on March 10, 1929, in Shanghai, and moved to the United States 18 years later. He spent one semester at Wesleyan University before transferring to Boston University, where he received bachelor's and master's degrees in economics. He quickly put them to use, becoming a securities analyst at Bache & Company in 1951, before joining Fidelity one year later.
 His marriages to Loretta Young, Marlyn Chase, Cynthia Ann Ekberg and Nancy Raeburn ended in divorce. Besides Christopher, he is survived by two other children, Veronica and Gerald, and five grandchildren. In 2006, Mr. Tsai became engaged to marry Sharon Bush, the former wife of President George W. Bush's brother Neil, but the marriage was called off in January.
 Christopher said Mr. Tsai shared his enthusiasm for the stock market with his children. He encouraged Christopher to learn about the markets at an early age, prompting him to start investing at 12.
 ''He loved doing transactions.'' Christopher said. ''He loved the excitement of it.''

HEADLINE: McCain Adviser Refers To 'Nation of Whiners,' Touching Off Rebukes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; John M. Broder contributed reporting from Fairfax, Va.

DATELINE: BELLEVILLE, Mich. 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain has spent the week trying to tell people that he feels their economic pain. So it was more than a little unhelpful when one of his top economic advisers was quoted Thursday as saying that the United States was only in a ''mental recession'' and that it had become a ''nation of whiners.''
 The adviser, former Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, sought to clarify his remarks Thursday by saying he had been referring only to some of the nation's leaders. 
 But it was too late to keep from complicating things for Mr. McCain, who has been trying to strike a more empathetic tone after sometimes struggling to maintain a balance between displays of optimism about the nation's future and demonstrating an understanding of Americans' economic hardships. 
 Senator Barack Obama, noting that Mr. McCain had previously said an expansion of offshore oil drilling might have a ''psychological'' benefit for the country, seized on Mr. Gramm's remarks, made in an interview with The Washington Times.
 ''You know, America already has one Dr. Phil,'' Mr. Obama said at a campaign stop in Fairfax, Va. ''When it comes to the economy, we don't need another.''
 Mr. McCain himself repudiated Mr. Gramm's comments. 
 ''The person here in Michigan that just lost his job isn't suffering a mental recession,'' he told reporters after a town-hall-style meeting at a factory in this city west of Detroit.
 And when he was asked whether Mr. Gramm -- McCain campaign co-chairman, UBS Investment Bank vice chairman and former economics professor -- might serve as treasury secretary in a McCain administration, the candidate replied with a flash of his sometimes tart humor.
 ''I think Senator Gramm would be in serious consideration for ambassador to Belarus,'' he said, ''although I'm not sure the citizens of Minsk would welcome that.''
 Mr. McCain has been spending the week in Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan pushing his economic proposals and trying to show a grasp of workers' financial struggles. 
 During the gathering here Thursday, held at Bayloff Stamped Products, which provides metal components to car manufacturers, he tried to fend off the skepticism of some Michigan workers about his support for free trade and said more than half a dozen times that people were ''hurting.'' 
 ''America is hurting today,'' he said. ''Michigan is hurting today. The automotive industry is hurting. And we've got big problems, and we've got big challenges.''
 Questioned about manufacturers' moving their plants elsewhere because of free trade, he replied, ''I have to tell you -- and I know that it's not popular -- I do believe in the overall benefits of free trade.''
 In recent months Mr. McCain has recalibrated the way he talks about the economy, often noting that it does not matter whether the technical definition of a recession has been met, given that so many people feel as if they are in one. The tone is in contrast with the one he struck during the primaries, when he sometimes placed more emphasis on optimism.
 His struggle to find a balance was on vivid display at a Republican debate in January, when he was asked whether the country was better off now than it was eight years ago.
 ''I think you could argue that Americans over all are better off,'' he replied, ''because we have had a pretty good, prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation, and a lot of good things have happened, a lot of jobs have been created.'' Then he added: ''But let's have some straight talk. Things are tough right now.''
 At the factory gathering Thursday, Mr. McCain repeated a statement that was used against him to great effect in the Michigan primary, which he lost to Mitt Romney. 
 ''I'll look at you in the eye again and I'll tell you that there are some jobs that won't come back,'' he said.
 But, the optimism hardly out of reach, he added that the lost jobs would be replaced with new ones to create more environmentally friendly technologies and other innovations. 
 ''I have to tell you that the innovation and the technology and the entrepreneurship of the world still lies in the United States of America,'' he said. ''Every technological advance we've made in the 21st century and throughout the 20th has come from the United States of America.''

HEADLINE: In Erratic Session, Giant Chemical Deal Lifts Shares

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street stumbled through another volatile session but ended with a respectable gain on Thursday after a multibillion-dollar deal in the chemicals sector helped offset concerns about the financial sector and energy costs. 
 Shares of the mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac skidded lower on worries they would be forced to sell more new shares than anticipated to compensate for losses from the housing slump. Several retail banks and investment banks also dropped, particularly Lehman Brothers Holdings. 
 The decline in financials came after Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. told Congress that Wall Street could not expect the government to bail out the troubled companies.
 ''For market discipline to effectively constrain risk, financial institutions must be allowed to fail,'' Mr. Paulson said.
 Meanwhile, crude oil prices rebounded more than $5 higher to more than $141 a barrel.
 Though investors found a reason to buy after Dow Chemical's $15 billion all-cash acquisition of the special chemicals maker Rohm & Haas, they were cautious ahead of quarterly earnings, particularly regarding financial results to be announced next week.
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 81.58 points, or 0.73 percent, at 11,229.02. Oil's resurgence back above $141 a barrel briefly pulled the Dow into negative territory in afternoon trading.
 Broader stock indicators also finished higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 8.70 points, or 0.70 percent, to 1,253.39, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 22.96 points, or 1.03 percent, to 2,257.85.
 Light, sweet crude oil for August delivery rose $5.60 to $141.65 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after another missile test by Iran and worries about disruptions in Nigeria.
 Bond prices ticked higher as stocks fluctuated. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 4/32, to 100 20/32 and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, slipped to 3.80 percent from 3.81 percent late on Wednesday. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies; gold prices rose.
 The biggest decliner among the 30 Dow companies was the American International Group, which fell $2.15, or 8.2 percent, to $23.99. On Wednesday night, the credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service lowered its financial rating on A.I.G.'s mortgage insurance subsidiary.
 Freddie Mac fell $2.26, or 22 percent, to $8, and Fannie Mae fell $2.11, or 13.8 percent, to $13.20. Lehman fell $2.44, or 12.4 percent, to $17.30.
 In economic data, the Labor Department said new applications for unemployment insurance fell by a seasonally adjusted 58,000, to 346,000, last week. But continuing claims rose, indicating lingering weakness in the labor market.
 In corporate news, Wal-Mart Stores credited sales of groceries and tax rebate checks for lifting June sales, and it raised its forecast for the current quarter. Costco Wholesale fell $1.29 to $70.86 although it reported that same-store sales, including gasoline, rose 9 percent in June.
 Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of 10-year inflation notes on Thursday:

HEADLINE: G.E. May Spin Off Its Consumer and Industrial Unit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
As it seeks to cut costs and bolster its flagging share price, General Electric may be willing to dispense with the business from which it sprang: the light bulb. 
 The conglomerate said on Thursday that it was focusing on spinning off its entire consumer and industrial unit, which includes the appliance business it has tried to sell for the last two months.
 Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, called the decision one of expediency as he seeks to refashion the corporate behemoth and cut costs. The company is scheduled to announce its second-quarter earnings on Friday morning.
 ''As we explored our options for appliances, it became clear that the fastest, most efficient step we could take in completing the transformation of our industrial portfolio would be to focus on a possible spinoff of the entire unit,'' he said in a statement.
 He did not rule out an outright sale of the appliances business. Potential bidders include foreign rivals like Haier of China and LG Electronics of South Korea, which are seeking to expand their market share in the United States.
 Mr. Immelt's cost-cutting effort has grown broader over the last year, as the company has lopped off some of its oldest businesses in a move to quiet critics and appease shareholders. Last year, the company sold its plastics business -- the proving ground for Mr. Immelt and his predecessor, John F. Welch Jr. -- to the Saudi Arabian firm Sabic for $11.6 billion.
 In April, G.E. reported worse-than-expected first-quarter earnings, which were battered by slowing consumer spending and the financial markets' turmoil. The company's stock plunged 13 percent that day, its biggest drop in two decades.
 Against that backdrop, G.E. said in May that it had hired Goldman Sachs to explore options for its appliances business, a unit that created common household items like room air-conditioners and the toaster ovens. On Thursday that effort grew to encompass a broader swath of the company's businesses, including the incandescent light bulbs invented by the company's co-founder, Thomas A. Edison.
 Mr. Immelt has been under pressure to sell off other holdings critics deem nonessential, including NBC Universal. 
 The move may suggest trouble in finding a buyer for the appliances business. G.E. has already acknowledged difficulties selling its credit card operations as concerns grow about consumers falling behind on payments.
 Though it may have roots in light bulbs, G.E.'s core businesses today are its higher-margin infrastructure and medical operations, along with its huge finance unit, which was partly to blame for the first-quarter woes. The consumer and industrials group generated about $13.3 billion in sales last year -- just 7.4 percent of the company's $173 billion in total sales. It has about 50,000 of G.E.'s 300,000 employees, though the company said last year that it would cut jobs at the unit.
 Thursday's announcement drew a tepid response from analysts and investors. ''While the deal does not unlock value per se, it is a step toward improving the portfolio,'' Jeffrey T. Sprague, a Citigroup analyst, wrote in a note. He maintained a hold rating on the stock.
 G.E. shares closed up about 1.6 percent on Thursday at $27.64. Shares have fallen 27 percent over the last year.

HEADLINE: The Candidates Speak Off the Cuff, and Trouble Quickly Follows

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
At this rate, both John McCain and Barack Obama may want to rethink their fondness for town-hall-style meetings. Both have embroiled themselves in controversies this week as a result of departing from scripted campaign speeches and speaking off the cuff.
 Start with Mr. Obama. Answering a question that touched on bilingualism at one such forum in Powder Springs, Ga., on Tuesday, he said, ''I agree that immigrants should learn English.'' But then he went on to poke fun at those who argue that ''we need English only'' and Americans who ''go over to Europe, and all we can say is 'merci beaucoup.' '' 
 ''Instead of worrying about whether immigrants can learn English -- they'll learn English -- you need to make sure your child can speak Spanish,'' he said. ''You should be thinking about how can your child become bilingual. We should have every child speaking more than one language.''
 Mr. Obama's comments were a slight variation on a theme that he regularly sounds in his stump speech: the need for young Americans to be able to compete in a globalized economy with their counterparts around the world. He often accompanies that with criticism of school districts that have reduced or eliminated elective offerings, like foreign language instruction, because of budget constraints.
 Conservative and ''official English'' groups immediately interpreted Mr. Obama's statement as an endorsement of the idea that ''Americans should be forced to learn to speak Spanish,'' in the words of the Americans for Legal Immigration PAC. But that not only misrepresents what Mr. Obama said, it also ignores the views he has expressed in the past on the proper role of English and foreign languages in American life. 
 In his book ''The Audacity of Hope'' (Crown, 2006), Mr. Obama writes that ''we can insist to those already here that with citizenship comes obligations -- to a common language,'' among other things. 
 But even as he said he wanted his daughters to learn Spanish, he also acknowledged: ''When I see Mexican flags waved at pro-immigration demonstrations, I sometimes feel a flush of patriotic resentment. When I'm forced to use a translator to communicate with the guy fixing my car, I feel a certain frustration.''
 In many respects, Mr. Obama's remarks echoed the Department of Education's own position on the importance of learning foreign languages. ''American students must master critical-need foreign language skills for our nation to remain competitive and continue the progress in securing our nation,'' the department's Web site states.
 That policy statement also draws a contrast between China, where studying English is compulsory for all primary school students, and the United States, where less than one quarter of public elementary schools report teaching foreign languages. One remedy, the statement suggests, is President Bush's National Security Language Initiative, parts of which Congress has approved.
 Bret Lovejoy, executive director of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, which represents some 11,000 foreign-language teachers across the country, said the group was ''thrilled'' that Mr. Obama raised the issue.
 ''It's common sense, what he said,'' Mr. Lovejoy said, ''because many Americans feel they don't need to learn another language, and that is a dangerous mindset in today's world.'' 
 For Mr. McCain, the biggest controversy stemmed from his answer to a question about Social Security at a forum in Denver on Monday. His response appeared to take issue with the ''pay as you go'' mechanism the system has used since its inception in 1937, in which those working today pay for the benefits of those who have retired. 
 ''Americans have got to understand that we are paying present-day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in America today,'' he said. ''And that's a disgrace. It's an absolute disgrace, and it's got to be fixed.''
 Afterward, spokesmen for the McCain campaign said that his use of ''disgrace'' was meant to refer not to Social Security itself but to Washington's unwillingness to address distortions developing in the system. Indeed, one such problem is the ratio of workers to retirees, which is declining. But Mr. McCain did not mention that issue explicitly, and seemed to undermine his staff's explanation when he appeared on CNN on Tuesday and, to a large extent, repeated himself.
 ''They pay their taxes, and right now their taxes are going to pay the retirement of present-day retirees,'' he said by way of explaining his support for allowing young workers to open private accounts for retirement. ''That's why it's broken; that's why we can fix it.''
 Groups supporting Mr. Obama have been quick to jump on Mr. McCain's statements. ''Multimillionaires like John McCain and George W. Bush don't have to worry about making ends meet, and they could care less about a program that has proven its worth for generations of Americans,'' Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, wrote on the Huffington Post blog.
 On his Web site, Mr. McCain does not express disapproval of the Social Security system. Instead, he promises to ''fight to save the future of Social Security while meeting our obligations to the retirees of today'' and says that he ''supports supplementing the current Social Security system with personal accounts -- but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept.'' 
 When Mr. Bush proposed partly privatizing Social Security in 2005, Mr. McCain supported the president, and in 2006 he voted in favor of legislation that would have moved the system in that direction.
 ''I'm totally in favor of personal savings accounts,'' Mr. McCain said in an interview in March with The Wall Street Journal. ''As part of Social Security reform, I believe that private savings accounts are a part of it -- along the lines that President Bush proposed.''

 IRANIAN MISSILE LAUNCHING PHOTO
 Apparently Altered, Agency Says
 A photo showing four Iranian missiles heading skyward that appeared on the front pages of major newspapers and on many news Web sites was ''apparently digitally altered'' by Iranian state media, according to the news agency Agence France-Presse. Agence France-Presse retracted its original image, saying the fourth missile ''has apparently been added in digital retouch to cover a grounded missile that may have failed during the test.'' PAGE A8 
 CHINESE ACTIVIST DETAINED
 A Chinese human rights activist has been detained on suspicion of illegally possessing state secrets. The activist, Huang Qi, wrote an article on the concerns about shoddy construction expressed by bereaved fathers whose children died during the earthquake in Sichuan Province.

 FREED CAPTIVE DEALS WITH PAIN
 A week after her sudden rescue from more than six years of captivity in the deep Colombian jungle, Ingrid Betancourt spoke in an interview of her deep Roman Catholic faith, and of her fragility. She fears the collapse she knows is coming. ''It's like the roaring of the waves, I know it's coming, and it's getting closer,'' she said. PAGE A6 
 BOOK OFFERS DETAILS ON DETENTIONS
 Red Cross investigators concluded in a secret report that the Central Intelligence Agency's interrogation methods for high-level Qaeda prisoners constituted torture and could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes, according to ''The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals,'' a new book by Jane Mayer on counterterrorism efforts since 2001. PAGE A9 
 ZIMBABWE'S RIVALS BEGIN TALKS
 Zimbabwe's ruling party began preliminary discussions with the opposition in an effort to settle a political crisis in which both sides have staked a claim to the nation's presidency. But Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, stated that the talks could not lead to genuine negotiations until state-sponsored violence stopped and 1,500 of his detained supporters were freed. PAGE A7 
 COURTS TEST THAI GOVERNMENT
 Just five months after a military junta handed back power through a parliamentary election, Thailand's latest try at democracy is being severely tested by street demonstrations and a barrage of court cases. The foreign minister was forced to resign after a nationalist furor over a centuries-old dispute with Cambodia over a temple on the border. PAGE A10

 CANDIDATES LEARN THE PITFALLS
 Of Talking Without Props
 Senators John McCain and Barack Obama have gotten themselves in hot water this week by speaking off the cuff. For some people, Mr. Obama's talk about the advantages of being bilingual actually meant that ''Americans should be forced to learn to speak Spanish.'' Mr. McCain, meanwhile, attached the word ''disgrace'' to Social Security in a way that led to some backtracking. PAGE A15
 OIL AS DIVIDING LINE
 Oil continued as a political dividing line in Washington, with House Democratic leaders taking a hard line against Republican efforts to open up restricted areas to oil production and the White House rejecting a Democratic call to release gasoline from national reserves in an effort to lower prices by increasing supply. PAGE A15
 AN UNADVISED REMARK
 Senator John McCain has been trying of late to demonstrate empathy for people's economic pain. But one of his top economic advisers, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, was quoted as saying that the United States was only in a ''mental recession'' and that it had become a ''nation of whiners.'' Mr. McCain was not happy to hear of it. Senator Barack Obama seemed pleased, though. PAGE A15
 MAYOR INDICTED IN MISSISSIPPI
 Mayor Frank Melton of Jackson, Miss., was indicted Wednesday on federal civil rights charges related to the unannounced demolition of a duplex that he said was a crack house. Mr. Melton, who ran for office on an anticrime platform and has been known to wear a badge and raid nightclubs in pursuit of that goal, was acquitted of state felony charges related to the same event in 2007. PAGE A11
 THE JACKSON IMPACT
 Jesse Jackson was quick to apologize after a microphone recorded his vulgar criticism of Senator Barack Obama. But there is some question about whether being on the bad side of Mr. Jackson is a disadvantage for Mr. Obama, who, by all appearances, does not seem overly concerned. Could it be that Mr. Jackson has lost relevance? PAGE A14
 OBITUARIES
 GERALD TSAI JR., 79
 A fund manager and financier, he pioneered the creation of performance funds in the 1950s and '60s and later turned a canning company into the financial services giant Primerica. Primerica and another company Mr. Tsai led, Smith Barney, were eventually sold to become building blocks of Citigroup. PAGE C10

 CITY WORKER TOOK BRIBES 
 For Rent Aid, Officials Say
 A former city housing agency supervisor has been arrested on charges that she took bribes from tenants to provide them with federal rent subsidy vouchers that should have gone to needy families. ''This is certainly the worst case I've seen in my seven years here'' involving the city's voucher program, said the commissioner of the Department of Investigation. PAGE B1 
 AN INSIGHT INTO CAPTIVITY
 The humans were in cages at the Bronx Zoo -- 37 of them, anyway -- after a wheel on one of the Skyfari gondolas slipped off the overhead cable, shutting down the system and stranding the passengers for up to five hours. ''I could feel their pain,'' said Meiki Pang, 26, of the winged and slithering animal brethren below. PAGE B1 
 SPINNING RECORDS COURTSIDE
 Who knew it would take Jay-Z's ''Dead Presidents'' to get Ron Artest, a Queens native who plays for the Sacramento Kings, going? Deejay J.U. knew, and that's why he's one of the most sought after D.J.'s in street basketball. The flashy version of playground basketball draws big crowds. PAGE B1 
 SPORTS
 YANKEES AND METS LOSE OUT
 On Final All-Star Voting
 Alas for Nick Ferraro, a lifelong Phillies fan who with three partners spent 53 straight hours at a computer trying to put outfielder Pat Burrell in the All-Star game, his efforts fell short. As did various other campaigns, including fake mustaches. Milwaukee's Corey Hart earned the last National League slot while Tampa Bay rookie Evan Longoria took the final American League opening. David Wright and Jason Giambi both missed the cut. PAGE C14
 ASSIGNING CREDIT FOR METS' RISE
 Various factors might be cited as the spark for the Mets' resurgence of late, including the departure of a manager and the fortunate awakening of previously slumbering bats. ''But these things tend to run deeper than the obvious,'' Harvey Araton writes in Sports of The Times, ''tracing to a development that probably didn't seem terribly important at the time.'' And of course he has a particular one in mind. PAGE D1
 DIPLOMA, CHECK. OLYMPICS, CHECK.
 Jake Deitchler graduated from Anoka High School in Anoka, Minn., last month, and plans something of a senior trip to Beijing. That is, if you can call competing in the Olympics in Greco-Roman wrestling a senior trip. At 18, Deitchler is the fifth such wrestler from Anoka High and the youngest United States Olympic wrestler since Mike Farina in 1976. PAGE D1
 BUSINESS
 TRYING TO TRACK MARKET FEAR,
 And Fearing a Possible Result
 The ''why's'' behind the tumbling shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are still unclear. ''There wasn't really any new news to set offthis crisis,'' one consultant said. ''The stocks just started falling, and didn't stop.'' Beyond the mystery is the fear that investors will lose so much confidence that the companies will be unable to function. PAGE C1
 A PUSH FOR BETTER PENSION NUMBERS
 The thinking is that no one would knowingly create a pension plan like the one Vallejo, Calif., did, which pushed the city into bankruptcy this year through costly police and firefighters' benefits. So accounting rule-makers have kicked off an effort to force state and local governments to issue better numbers for their pension promises. PAGE C8
 SHEDDING LIGHTS
 Further proof that there is no room for sentimentality in business: General Electric may be willing to dispense with the business from which it sprang, the light bulb, in its efforts to cut costs and increase its flagging share price. It hopes to spin off its consumer and industrial units, which includes the appliance business it has tried to sell for the past two months. PAGE C2
 A WARNING ON OIL PRICES
 A military conflict involving Iran would bring an ''unlimited'' increase in the price of oil, the head of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries warned, saying the group's members would be unable to make up the lost production. Even mentioning the possibility helped push up the price $5.60, to $141.65 a barrel. PAGE C4
 RETHINKING MONEY MARKET FUNDS
 Putting cash in a money market fund is supposed to pretty much be the financial equivalent of betting on the sun rising in the east. But lately some of the financial companies that run them have found themselves at risk and have been paying up billions of dollars to ensure the funds stay on an even keel. PAGE C8
 SALES FAIL TO STIR INVESTORS
 A combination of price reductions, government stimulus checks and warm weather helped retailers to better than expected sales in June. But investors responded with a big So What?, sending a number of stocks down. ''They don't trust the numbers,'' one analyst said. ''They don't trust that 2008 is the recovery year.'' PAGE C4

 Weekend
 BOGART WITH CIGAR AND GUN,
 But Also Red Skin and Horns?
 ''Hellboy 2: The Golden Army'' is awash in pulp undertones, noirish sensibility, a cigar-chomping hardboiled hero, unrequited love and a giant homicidal plant. What's not to love? At 110 minutes of mayhem, this second film adaptation of Mike Mignola's ''Hellboy'' comic franchise occasionally loses itself in the details, but comic-book fans and theatergoers alike may well rejoice, A.O. Scott writes. Oh, did we mention the feuding elves? Page B1 
 WHISPERS COULD BE ONLY FOR YOU
 You could assume that the play exists only for you, as you don your headphones and sit. Peter S. Petralia's ''Whisper,'' at Performance Space 122, ''starts dark and gets darker.'' Let the narrator unfold the story, and accept the tricks played by the lighting and sound as actors behind a gauzy scrim evoke the ''feel of a psychological thriller,'' Anita Gates writes. Page B5 
 MYRIAD PARTICLES GIVEN VOICE
 Whether melted for glass, used to measure time or irritably from car seats and hair, sand is there. A new exhibition at the Parrish Art Museum in Southhampton, N.Y., offers an artistic meditation. ''Works that evoke time, impermanence and innumerability are the heart of the show,'' Ken Johnson writes. Page B30 
 TENSION WAVERS IN SOFT LIGHTING
 There are gunshots, terrorists, flak jackets and flashing lights. There are tensions and banter and a Croatian-speaking negotiator. All things one expects from a grown-up police show, but ''Flashpoint,'' a new show about a group of special-ops officers, often seems to be about crisis that ''refuses to make you anxious,'' Ginia Bellafante writes. Page B21

 ECHOES OF AN EARLIER TIME
 Even Before Baseball
 If someone mentions Cooperstown, N.Y., and your first thought is not the Baseball Hall of Fame but instead James Fenimore Cooper, congratulations on your literary and historical chops. The fact is, in addition to that worthy sports museum, the region has attractions that are literary, cultural, recreational and still, despite the depredations of the centuries, naturally beautiful. PAGE D7 
 CHANGING PERSPECTIVES
 The older you get, so the saying goes, the smarter your parents become. And as some parents are discovering, the older their children get, the better they like that vacation home that they whined about being taken to when they were younger. It's all a matter of perspective. The message: If you keep it, they will come. PAGE D1

 One way to prevent borderline youthful offenders from becoming serious criminals is to treat them in community-based counseling programs instead of shipping them off to juvenile facilities hundreds of miles away from home. PAGE A18

HEADLINE: Sales Are Up, But Investors Remain Leery Of Retailers

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Price reductions, the federal government and Mother Nature helped retailers gain solid sales growth last month.
Investors, however, were unimpressed.
Retailers said on Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year, known as same-store sales and a barometer of retail health, rose higher than expected in June thanks to aggressive summer promotions, government stimulus checks and warm weather. Over all, chain store sales for June climbed 4.3 percent from last year, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group.
Even so, the news failed to inspire investors who sent several stocks down, revealing a disconnect between stock prices and company performance. Costco Wholesale, BJ's Wholesale Club, Target, Kohl's and Aeropostale all increased their same-store sales for June, yet their shares fell Thursday. 
Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer, beat expectations and increased store traffic but its shares were down 0.8 percent, or 46 cents, to $57.21.
''Investors don't care about retail,'' said Bill Dreher, senior equity analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. ''They don't trust the numbers. They don't trust that 2008 is the recovery year. The question is now, when in 2009 will we see a recovery?''
The quarter is not over and retailers are preparing themselves for the back-to-school season, the second-most important time of year after Christmas. But as John D. Morris, senior retail analyst at Wachovia, said, ''I think the investors don't want to wait to get the report card.''
''It's kind of a low degree of confidence on the outlook,'' he added.
Stores that fared the best in June did not necessarily offer the most au courant apparel. But they did offer the latest American retail trend: low prices.
Wal-Mart's same-store sales in the United States rose 5.8 percent in June, excluding fuel, with the strongest results in grocery, entertainment and health and wellness. Sales at the company's namesake stores rose 6.1 percent.
Wal-Mart is reaping the rewards of three years' updates: for the first time in more than two years, the company had positive growth in all six of its merchandise units -- including apparel, an area it has been trying to get right for years.
Eduardo Castro-Wright, chief executive of Wal-Mart's United States operations, said in a statement that assortments and brands have improved, which bodes well for the future, including the back-to-school season.
Sales at Sam's Club stores were up 4.6 percent, excluding fuel, with fresh foods and dry grocery products among the strongest areas. Housewares and jewelry were the weakest performers.
June same-store sales at Target increased more moderately, 0.4 percent, slightly above the company's planned range, according to Gregg W. Steinhafel, the chief executive of the Target Corporation.
The TJX Companies, which operates T. J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, increased 5 percent.
Wholesalers are also benefiting from the economic slowdown. Same-store sales at BJ's Wholesale Club were up 8.3 percent, excluding fuel. The Costco Wholesale Corporation's same-store sales were up about 5 percent, excluding fuel.
Specialty chains that offered good value received a boost as well. Same-store sales at Children's Place were up 16 percent. Aeropostale's same-store sales for June increased 12 percent.
''We're a little bit surprised by the robustness,'' said Ken Perkins, the founder of Retail Metrics, a research firm.
For some retailers, though, stimulus checks and sunny skies were not enough to lift sales.
Same-store sales for apparel chain stores were down 4.6 percent in June, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. Limited Brands, which includes Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works, said same-store sales decreased 9 percent.
Gap's sluggish performance continued, with same-store sales for June decreasing 7 percent. North American divisions of the company, Banana Republic and Old Navy, were down 5 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Chico's FAS same-store sales decreased 12.9 percent.
In general, department stores remained among the retailers faring the worst. Analysts predict a future shakeout that will probably result in consolidation and sales of stores.
''They are still clearly struggling,'' said Mr. Perkins of Retail Metrics. ''It's all about discount and off-price.''
Bon-Ton Stores said same-store sales decreased 6.5 percent. Dillard's sales decreased 5 percent. J. C. Penney's same-store sales decreased 2.4 percent.
Sears, like an increasing number of retailers, did not report same-store sales, though analysts said the company could have double-digit declines.
The midtier department store Kohl's, on the other hand, benefited from stimulus checks. Its same-store sales increased 2.3 percent. R. Lawrence Montgomery, Kohl's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that inventories were ''well-controlled'' as the company entered July with inventory at individual stores well below last year's.
On the high end of retailing, Nordstrom's same-store sales decreased 18.6 percent, which the company attributed in part to the shift of its ''half-yearly sale for women and kids'' into May.
At the specialty retail stores segment of Neiman Marcus, which includes Neiman Marcus Stores and Bergdorf Goodman, same-store sales decreased 2.8 percent.
Same-stores sales at Saks increased 1.9 percent, though the company warned that its same-store sales were likely to fall slightly in the second quarter.
Looking ahead, the International Council of Shopping Centers estimated there would be a 2 percent to 3 percent increase in July same-store sales.
''July should be O.K.,'' said Mr. Perkins of Retail Metrics, who cautioned that the June figures were probably an aberration. ''Heading into the holiday quarter,'' he added, ''is going to be very tricky.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Weighs Takeover Plan For Two Mortgage Giants

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON and STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Charles Duhigg and Jenny Anderson contributed reporting from New York; Michael Cooper from Livonia, Mich.; and David M. Herszenhorn from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Alarmed by the growing financial stress at the nation's two largest mortgage finance companies, senior Bush administration officials are considering a plan to have the government take over one or both of the companies and place them in a conservatorship if their problems worsen, people briefed about the plan said on Thursday.
The companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have been hit hard by the mortgage foreclosure crisis. Their shares are plummeting and their borrowing costs are rising as investors worry that the companies will suffer losses far larger than the $11 billion they have already lost in recent months. Now, as housing prices decline further and foreclosures grow, the markets are worried that Fannie and Freddie themselves may default on their debt.
Under a conservatorship, the shares of Fannie and Freddie would be worth little or nothing, and any losses on mortgages they own or guarantee -- which could be staggering -- would be paid by taxpayers. 
The government officials said that the administration had also considered calling for legislation that would offer an explicit government guarantee on the $5 trillion of debt owned or guaranteed by the companies. But that is a far less attractive option, they said, because it would effectively double the size of the public debt.
The officials also said that such a step would be ineffective because the markets already widely accept that the government stands behind the companies.
The officials involved in the discussions stressed that no action by the administration was imminent, and that Fannie and Freddie are not considered to be in a crisis situation. But in recent days, enough concern has built among senior government officials over the health of the giant mortgage finance companies for them to hold a series of meetings and conference calls to discuss contingency plans.
A conservatorship or other rescue operation would be the second time in four months that the Bush administration has stepped in to engineer a rescue to prevent the financial system from collapsing. Last March, it forced the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase to avert a bankruptcy of that venerable investment house.
Officials have also been concerned that the difficulties of the two companies, if not fixed, could damage economies worldwide. The securities of Fannie and Freddie are held by numerous overseas financial institutions, central banks and investors.
Under a 1992 law, Fannie or Freddie could be put into conservatorship if their top regulator found that either one is ''critically undercapitalized.'' A conservator would have sweeping powers to overhaul them, but would not have the authority to close them.
The markets showed fresh signs on Thursday of being nervous about the future of the companies. Their stock prices continued a weeklong slide, hitting their lowest level in 17 years. The debt markets, meanwhile, pushed up the two companies' cost of borrowing -- their lifeblood for buying mortgages.
The companies are by far the biggest providers of financing for domestic home loans. If they are unable to borrow, they will not be able to buy mortgages from commercial lenders. In turn, that would make it more expensive and difficult, if not impossible, for home buyers to obtain credit, freezing the United States housing market. Even healthy banks are reluctant to tie up scarce capital by offering mortgages to low-risk home buyers without Fannie and Freddie taking the loans off their books.
Together the two companies touch more than half of the nation's $12 trillion in mortgages by either owning them or backing them. They hold more than $1.5 trillion of the mortgages as securities. Others are sold to investors in the form of mortgage-backed bonds.
In recent weeks, the companies have spiraled downward, undermined by declining confidence in their future and shaken by sharp declines in their assets as the housing markets have continued to slide and foreclosures have risen.
In the last week alone, Freddie has lost 45 percent of its value, and Fannie is off 30 percent. Expectations of default at the companies have also risen; it costs three times as much today to buy insurance on a two-year Fannie bond as it did three years ago.
Analysts expect the companies to announce a new round of write-downs and possibly be forced to raise capital by issuing additional shares, which would dilute their value for current shareholders.
Despite repeated assurances from regulators about the financial soundness of the two institutions, financial markets have concluded that by some measures they are deeply troubled.
Freddie, for instance, is technically insolvent under fair value accounting rules, in which the company puts a market value on assets as if it had to sell them now.
Although Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, passed up invitations by lawmakers on Thursday to seek legislation to deal with the crisis, officials said that the administration had been privately considering a government takeover should the markets continue to turn against the companies.
At a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday, both Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke were guarded, carefully trying not to say anything that could further erode confidence in Fannie and Freddie. They both said that the regulator of Fannie and Freddie had found that they were, in the words of Mr. Paulson, ''adequately capitalized,'' meaning that they had sufficient cash and other assets to withstand the turbulence in the markets.
''Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are also working through this challenging period,'' Mr. Paulson said.
Neither official would address a question posed by Representative Dennis Moore, Democrat of Kansas, who asked whether the failure of either institution would pose a risk to the financial system.
''In today's world I don't think it is helpful to speculate about any financial institution and systemic risk,'' Mr. Paulson said. ''I'm dealing with the here and now, and the important role that they're playing and other financial institutions are playing.''
Mr. Bernanke said that Fannie and Freddie ''are well-capitalized in the regulatory sense'' but added that they, and other major financial institutions, needed to raise their capital levels further.
Despite repeated denials by officials in the Bush and prior administrations, financial markets have long assumed the government would stand behind Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in times of difficulty, both because they are integral to the housing and financial markets and because the companies have a line of credit to the Treasury.
But Congress set that credit more than 38 years ago, long before the companies rose to such size and prominence, and its limit, $2.25 billion for each, has become a tiny fraction of the companies' overall debt.
Some analysts have begun to propose that the Fed also permit the two companies to borrow from it, as Wall Street investment banks began doing after the rescue of Bear Stearns. But there is no indication that the Fed is contemplating such a move.
On Thursday, the rapid sell-off of shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac came after a former central banker made comments that the companies might not be solvent, and an analyst at UBS issued a report critical of Freddie Mac.
The turmoil also shook the debt of the companies, with one main measure indicating that their cost of borrowing has risen to the highest level since mid-March, when the government rescued Bear Stearns. Throughout the day, senior officials sought to reassure the markets about the financial health of Fannie and Freddie.
Later in the afternoon, James B. Lockhart, the regulator who oversees the two companies, issued a statement that his agency was carefully watching the companies' ''credit and capital positions'' and said that they were adequate to get through the current turmoil.
Fannie Mae issued a statement saying that it remained financially strong.
''Our company has raised more than $14 billion in capital since November 2007, including $7.4 billion most recently in May,'' the company said. ''As our regulator has stated, and has reiterated in public statements this week, we are adequately capitalized.''
Sharon McHale, vice president for public relations at Freddie Mac, said: ''Our regulator has emphasized that we have continued to maintain the highest capital rating, and we are in the market every day. We'll continue to do so.''
Shares of Freddie Mac plunged more than 30 percent and Fannie Mae's more than 20 percent in the first hour of trading on Thursday. By the close of trading, Fannie shares had fallen nearly 14 percent, and Freddie shares had dropped 22 percent. It was the second straight day of declines for the companies.
While their stocks trade on the New York Stock Exchange, Congress created the two companies to promote housing, and the marketplace has long come to believe that they would be bailed out should they become insolvent. They hold a far lower level of capital than banks do. In recent years, they have both suffered from accounting scandals and management shake-ups.
Neither Mr. Paulson nor Mr. Bernanke, at the hearing on Thursday, would answer a question about whether Congress needs to give the regulators more tools to deal with the possible insolvency at either company.
''I don't think we should be speculating or talking about what-if's with any particular institutions, and so with Fannie or Freddie, what I'm emphasizing is that the tool that I want is the reform and the reform legislation that would inject confidence into the marketplace,'' Mr. Paulson said, referring to a measure that would revamp the oversight of the companies.
The problems of the two companies spilled onto the campaign trail on Thursday when Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, said he supported federal intervention to save Fannie or Freddie from collapsing.
''Those institutions, Fannie and Freddie, have been responsible for millions of Americans to be able to own their own homes, and they will not fail, we will not allow them to fail,'' Mr. McCain said during a stop at the Senate Coney Island Restaurant in Livonia, Mich. ''They are vital to Americans' ability to own their own homes. And we will do what's necessary to make sure that they continue that function.''
Jason Furman, the economic policy director for the Democratic presidential campaign of Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, said that Mr. Obama ''believes the Bush administration's willful neglect of warning signs in housing, in financial markets and in the job market, have compromised the nation's housing finance system.''
''The challenges facing Fannie and Freddie are part of the broader weakness in our economy,'' Mr. Furman said.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, said that the markets should rest assured that the mortgage giants have a ''federal lifeline'' and would not be allowed to fail -- though he said he thought a government rescue would not be needed and should be a last resort.

HEADLINE: Can't Find a Parking Spot? Check Smartphone

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
The secret to finding the perfect parking spot in congested cities is usually just a matter of luck. But drivers here will get some help from an innocuous tab of plastic that will soon be glued to the streets.
 This fall, San Francisco will test 6,000 of its 24,000 metered parking spaces in the nation's most ambitious trial of a wireless sensor network that will announce which of the spaces are free at any moment. 
 Drivers will be alerted to empty parking places either by displays on street signs, or by looking at maps on screens of their smartphones. They may even be able to pay for parking by cellphone, and add to the parking meter from their phones without returning to the car. 
 Solving the parking mess takes on special significance in San Francisco because two years ago a 19-year-old, Boris Albinder, was stabbed to death during a fight over a parking space. 
 ''If the San Francisco experiment works, no one will have to murder anyone over a parking space,'' said Donald Shoup, a professor of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles, whose work on the pricing of parking spaces and whether more spaces are good for cities has led to a revolution in ideas about relieving congestion. 
 ''It will have a cascade of positive effects on transportation and the economy and environment,'' he said. About a dozen major cities are in discussions with technology companies to deploy so-called smart parking systems, though San Francisco is ahead in its efforts. 
 New York City is not among them. The Bloomberg administration's plan for easing traffic through a congestion pricing plan died in the State Legislature this spring, though high gas prices are reducing traffic somewhat on their own. 
 Not that New Yorkers need any reminders of their traffic problems, but a study released in June by Transportation Alternatives, a public transit advocacy group, reported that 28 percent to 45 percent of traffic on some streets in New York City is generated by people circling the blocks. 
 The study also said that drivers searching for metered parking in just a 15-block area of Columbus Avenue on Manhattan's Upper West Side drove 366,000 miles a year. 
 Gavin Newsom, San Francisco's mayor, said that better parking systems were part of a broader approach to managing congestion without imposing restrictive tolls, as used in London and Singapore to discourage driving in downtown areas. 
 For Mr. Newsom the largest part of the challenge is replacing the city's aging infrastructure.
 ''When I watch the movie 'Vertigo,' '' I still recognize every single traffic signal,'' said the Mr. Newsom, referring to the 50-year old Alfred Hitchcock film. 
 SFpark, part of a nearly two-year $95.5 million program intended to clear the city's arteries, will also make it possible for the city to adjust parking times and prices. For example, parking times could be lengthened in the evening to allow for longer visits to restaurants.
 The city's planners want to ensure that at any time, on-street parking is no more than 85 percent occupied. This strategy is based on research by Mr. Shoup, who has estimated that drivers searching for curbside parking are responsible for as much of 30 percent of the traffic in central business districts.
 In one small Los Angeles business district that he studied over the course of a year, cars cruising for parking created the equivalent of 38 trips around the world, burning 47,000 gallons of gasoline and producing 730 tons of carbon dioxide.
 To install the market-priced parking system, San Francisco has used a system devised by Streetline, a small technology company that has adapted a wireless sensor technology known as ''smart dust'' that was pioneered by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. 
 It gives city parking officials up-to-date information on whether parking spots are occupied or vacant. The embedded sensors will also be used to relay congestion information to city planners by monitoring the speed of traffic flowing on city streets. The heart of the system is a wirelessly connected sensor embedded in a 4-inch-by-4-inch piece of plastic glued to the pavement adjacent to each parking space. 
 The device, called a ''bump,'' is battery operated and intended to last for five and 10 years without service. From the street the bumps form a mesh of wireless Internet signals that funnel data to parking meters on to a central management office near the San Francisco city hall.
 Streetline has technology that will display open parking spaces on Web sites that can be accessed through wireless devices like smartphones. They are also developing a low-cost battery-operated street display that will be able to alert drivers to open parking spots nearby. 
 The San Francisco project is part of a more ambitious sensor network that will use technology for a range of services. It will be possible to monitor air quality as well as deploy noise sensors that act as sentries for everything from gunshots to car crashes. Advocates assert that wireless sensor technology is now so inexpensive and reliable that it is practical to use for essential city services.
 ''The broader picture is what we're building is an operating system for the city that allows you to talk to or control all the inanimate objects out there to reduce the cost and improve quality of city services,'' said Tod Dykstra, chief executive of Streetline, the company that is supplying the wireless sensor technology to San Francisco.
 Mr. Newsom thinks that San Francisco will rally behind the sensor technology and will expand it to all of the city's on-street and parking garage spaces in 2010. 
 ''There isn't a person who hasn't experienced the travails of going around the block multiple times searching for a parking space, using gas and wasting time and generating greenhouse gases,'' he said. ''It will scale in people's consciousness to the point that the public will demand more.''

HEADLINE: Cost of Oil Dulling the Shine of a Global Air Show

BYLINE: By CAROLINE BROTHERS; Micheline Maynard contributed reporting.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The barons of civil and military aviation converging for the Farnborough International Air Show should have plenty to talk about. 
 Many airlines around the world are battling insolvency. The price of oil has shot up to as high as $147 a barrel. European governments are weighing new environmental taxes to limit the industry's contribution to global warming. And Washington has decided to reopen bidding on a $35 billion air tanker contract for the Air Force.
 ''This is the most uncertain time I've known in the industry for 29 years,'' said Doug McVitie, founder and chief consultant at Arran Aerospace in Dinan, France. ''The whole stability of the business has been upset by the oil price.'' 
 The air show, which starts Monday, is usually a time for the industry to dazzle customers with gleaming new planes, the latest technology and military might. 
 This year, however, oil prices are likely to preoccupy the representatives of 1,500 companies from 35 countries at aviation's showcase event, which alternates each year between Farnborough, outside London, and Paris. 
 Those soaring costs have driven home the need for more efficient jet fleets -- particularly in the United States, where some airlines are still flying two-decade-old MD-80s and first-generation 737s. 
 But efforts to modernize fleets face a headwind. The big manufacturers have production delays for their next-generation jets, like the superjumbo Airbus A380 and the midsize 787 Dreamliner from Boeing. 
 And many airlines are struggling as higher airfares and softening economies have cut demand. 
 Last month, the International Air Transport Association forecast global airline losses of $6.1 billion for 2008 if oil prices average $135 a barrel. Many airlines are culling fleets, dropping flights, charging for checked bags and adding surcharges to ticket prices to offset fuel outlays. 
 ''For many of them, buying new, more fuel-efficient planes to combat the doubling of fuel costs can be no part of their agenda,'' said Howard Wheeldon, a strategist at BGC Partners, a brokerage firm in London. 
 The Air Transport Association, which represents American carriers, thinks business will be even worse for the domestic companies. It forecasts a loss of at least $7.2 billion -- and as high as $13 billion if oil prices keep climbing. The American industry's worst year was 2002, when airlines lost $11 billion as air travel was devastated after 9/11.
 Already airlines are starting to reassess, postpone and cancel their orders, and that looks likely to continue as long as oil prices stay stubbornly high.
 ''It's inevitable we will start to see a few wanting to defer,'' said Rupinder Vig, an aviation analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. 
 Adding to carriers' strain is a decision by the European Union last month to require all airlines using European airports to buy pollution credits starting in 2012. Airlines see that as yet another tax they can ill afford, particularly since the timing of new innovations to make aircraft greener is unclear. 
 ''If you want to make a new plane, it needs to have a sufficient jump in fuel consumption and overall economic performance to be worth the investment,'' said Barbara Kracht, a spokeswoman at Airbus. 
 ''You need the technology, particularly engine technology, and that won't be ready before the second half of the next decade,'' she added. 
 Nor can the airlines expect quick breakthroughs from engine makers like Rolls-Royce, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney just because the price of oil has skyrocketed, given the time needed for leaps in technology. 
 Plane manufacturers face tough times, as well. ''After 2010 they are going to be hit by a fierce down cycle,'' said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. He projects that business could shrink as much as 40 percent.
 Still, they have big order lists that should see them through the next two years. ''They have just enough cushion in their backlog and from Middle Eastern demand to make them look better than they are,'' Mr. Aboulafia said. 
 Analysts are predicting an order at Farnborough from Etihad Airways, based in Abu Dhabi, for about 100 aircraft, and they see more coming from Qatar Airways, Air Arabia and Emirates. Carriers in the Middle East are benefiting as high oil prices bolster their region's economies.

HEADLINE: On Chicago Campus, Milton Friedman's Legacy of Controversy Continues

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
 The Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman generated storms of controversy when he was alive, and he is managing to do the same now, more than a year after his death. A plan by members of the economics, business and law faculties at the University of Chicago to honor Friedman, itsmost famous alumnus, by naming a new research institute after him has run into opposition from dozens of their colleagues who are unhappy that the honor could be interpreted as a wholesale endorsement of Friedman's free-market ideology. 
 Some opponents have been so disturbed by the proposal that they have recently asked the university president, Robert J. Zimmer, and its provost, Thomas Rosenbaum, to take the unusual step of convening the entire faculty to debate the issue. 
 ''This is a way to force a discussion,'' said Bruce Lincoln, a professor at the university's divinity school. ''We don't want to accept this as a fait accompli.'' The last time the entire faculty met, Mr. Lincoln said, was in 1986 to discuss whether the university should divest its holdings in South Africa. 
 Mr. Lincoln was one of the professors who helped organize a faculty petition that gathered 101 signatures against the new Milton Friedman Institute and who met with the president and the provost in June to discuss their grievances. 
 Mr. Rosenbaum noted that the idea for the institute initially came from members of the economics and business departments, adding that the council of the faculty senate, which represents the professors at Chicago, was also brought into the process. ''There's been a large amount of faculty input at every stage,'' he said. 
 Although the university is ''moving forward with the Friedman Institute,'' Mr. Rosenbaum said, he encouraged opponents to come up with their own proposals for research into economics and society. ''We take very seriously the notion that for enterprises to be robust, they have to bubble up from the faculty.''
 Faculty supporters of the Friedman Institute are somewhat baffled by the outcry. 
 ''It's hard to say what it's all about,'' said John H. Cochrane, a professor at Chicago's Graduate School of Business, who served on the institute's founding committee, referring to the petition as ''drivel.''
 ''Milton Friedman was probably the greatest economist of the 20th century,'' he said, adding that the proposal describes the center ''pretty explicitly as an economic research institute without a particular ideology.''
 More than 100 professors signed the petition, declaring that they were ''disturbed by the ideological and disciplinary preference implied by the university's massive support for the economic and political doctrines that have extended from Friedman's work,'' and the implication that Chicago's faculty ''lacks intellectual and ideological diversity.'' 
 Lars Peter Hansen, an economics professor who was chairman of the institute's founding committee, said: ''I was a little bit surprised, because we had taken it to the faculty senate and aired it thoroughly.'' Mr. Hansen said that he was aware that some people might worry that the institute would be seen as a right-wing research group, which is why the committee took the time to bring it up. 
 Opponents have pointed to a passage in the proposal that states: ''Following Friedman's lead, the design and evaluation of economic policy requires analyses that respect the incentives of individuals and the essential role of markets in allocating goods and services. As Friedman and others continually demonstrated, design of public policy without regard to market alternatives has adverse social consequences.'' 
 Friedman, who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1976, said he fervently believed the government should stay out of the economy as much as possible; the group of economists who followed his lead was called the Chicago School. (The university continues to employ more than its share of Nobel winners in economics, including Gary S. Becker, James J. Heckman and Roger B. Myerson.)
 But to critics, Friedman's prescriptions, which were enthusiastically embraced by the Reagan administration as well as by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the 1980s and '90s, caused severe hardships throughout the developing world. Friedman was also reviled in some quarters for his association with dictatorial regimes like that of Gen. Augusto Pinochet in Chile. As an article in The Chicago Tribune noted, the institute ''renews a split on campus about Friedman himself.''
 Mr. Hansen said that the primary connection between Friedman's approach and the institute's is the idea that research ought to be empirically grounded or based in real-world experiments. ''We want the best research out there,'' no matter what someone's personal views are, he said. 
 He made a point of differentiating the new institute, scheduled to open this fall, from other university-based centers with an ideological bent, like the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University. ''This is a very different model,'' Mr. Hansen said. 
 Mr. Lincoln acknowledged that faculty representatives had been told about the institute in February but said that the proposal was not debated or brought up for a vote. 
 As an opponent of the entire institute, rather than simply its name, Mr. Lincoln characterized himself on the extreme end of the opposition. He said he would like to see a research center ''much more committed to free inquiry and a larger debate, and not just grinding the same ax sharper and sharper.''
 The university has set a goal of $200 million for the institute's endowment, contributing $500,000 in seed money, with the rest coming through donations from alumni and business leaders.

HEADLINE: Weak Dollar Helps Shrink Trade Deficit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit narrowed in May as exports, including industrial supplies and consumer goods, climbed to records.
 The latest snapshot of trade activity, reported by the Commerce Department on Friday, showed that the nation's trade gap decreased to $59.8 billion, largely because of the declining dollar. That was down 1.2 percent from April's trade deficit and was the best showing since March. 
 The improvement came even as imports, including crude oil, rose to records. Many economists had expected the trade gap to widen, and were forecasting a deficit of $62.2 billion, on average, in May.
 Exports of American-made goods and services totaled $157.6 billion in May, a 0.9 percent increase from April. The declining value of the dollar relative to other currencies, especially the euro, is helping to make American exports cheaper and thus more attractive to foreign buyers. Growth in exports has been one of the few bright spots for the economy, which has been pounded by housing, credit and financial crises.
 Imports of goods and services grew to a record of $217.3 billion in May, a 0.3 percent increase from the previous month.
 The stronger export figures should help bolster overall economic growth during the April-to-June quarter, which is already shaping up to be better than the grim projections made at the start of the year, when many feared the economy might contract. Tax rebates also are energizing shoppers, which should help second-quarter activity.
 ''The narrowing trade deficit may be enough to keep second-quarter growth in the black,'' said Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors. The economy could grow to more than 2 percent, from 1 percent, in the second quarter, according to various projections.
 The trade deficit with oil-producing nations, including Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Nigeria and Venezuela, rose to a record of $17.9 billion in May.
 The politically delicate trade deficit with China widened to $21 billion in May, from $20 billion in April. 
 Exports to the European Union totaled a record $24.2 billion in May, helped by the weakened dollar.
 American exports to Japan totaled $6.2 billion in May, the second-highest on record. Exports to Canada were a record $24.5 billion in May.

HEADLINE: 2 Decisions Shut Door on Bush Clean-Air Steps

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER; Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Any major steps by the Bush administration to control air pollution or reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases came to a dead end on Friday, the combined result of a federal court ruling and a decision by the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 In the morning, a federal appeals court struck down the cornerstone of the administration's strategy to control industrial air pollution by agreeing with arguments by the utility industry that the E.P.A. had exceeded its authority when it established the Clean Air Interstate Rule in 2005. The court, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, said the rule, which set new requirements for major pollutants, had ''fatal flaws.''
 A few hours later, the E.P.A. chief rejected any obligation to regulate heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide under existing law, saying that to do so would involve an ''unprecedented expansion'' of the agency's authority that would have ''a profound effect on virtually every sector of the economy,'' touching ''every household in the land.'' 
 Taken together, the developments make it clear that any significant new effort to fight air pollution will fall to the next president. 
 The comments by the E.P.A. administrator, Stephen L. Johnson, reinforced a message that the administration had been sending for months: that it does not intend to impose mandatory controls on the emissions that cause climate change. John Walke, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental group, said, ''As a result of today, July 11, the Bush administration has failed to achieve a single ounce in reductions of smog, soot, mercury or global warming pollution from power plants.''
 Mr. Johnson said he was ''extremely disappointed'' in the court decision ''because it's overturning one of the most significant and health-protective rules in our nation's history.''
 But on climate change, he said laws like the Clean Air Act were ''ill-suited'' to the complexities of regulating greenhouse gases. 
 Mr. Johnson's comments appeared as a preface to a report by the E.P.A. staff sketching out how the emission of heat-trapping gases, particularly by vehicles, might be handled under the Clean Air Act. The report was intended to address a Supreme Court directive that the agency decide whether such gases threaten people's health or welfare. But it also reflects the deep disapproval of controls on such gases by the White House and agencies like the Transportation, Agriculture and Commerce Departments.
 In effect, Mr. Johnson was simultaneously publishing the policy analysis of his scientific and legal experts and repudiating its conclusions. 
 The Clean Air Interstate Rule, which covered states in the eastern half of the country, set new requirements for controls on major pollutants emitted by industry, particularly the electric utilities. At its most stringent, it would have required, beginning in 2015, 70 percent reductions in sulfur dioxide and 60 percent reductions in nitrogen oxide from 2003 levels.
 At the time the interstate pollution rule was adopted, the E.P.A. estimated that, when fully in effect after 2015, it would cut by 13,000 annually the number of premature deaths from breathing polluted air.
 The court ruling, combined with a court decision this year striking down an E.P.A. rule controlling mercury emissions from power plants, means that virtually all controls on the electric utility industry by the Bush administration have no force.
 ''The implications are huge,'' said Lisa Heinzerling, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. ''This is the administration's major air pollution initiative.'' 
 The restrictions were designed, Ms. Heinzerling said, to deal comprehensively with a variety of air pollution issues, including the interstate transport of pollutants and the states' obligations to enforce standards to protect the public health.
 But with the court's decision, she said, all of the administration's efforts, aside from those involving vehicles, ''are gone.''
 ''Anything they've done that has any relation to pollution control has been invalidated,'' she said.
 The court decision disappointed even the victors.
 Jim Owen of the Edison Electric Institute said, ''In our industry, one of the things we crave is certainty, and this goes in the other direction.''
 Brent W. Dorsey, the director of corporate environmental programs at Entergy, the large energy producer, added, ''With this thing thrown out, we've basically thrown the baby out with the bathwater.''
 Entergy, one of the companies that brought the case to court, emphasized on Friday that it did not want the whole rule thrown out and that it had challenged only the part that allocated permits for emissions of pollutants around the industry. The company said an 11th-hour change by the E.P.A. had put too much of the cleanup burden on areas using oil and gas for power generation, as Entergy does, and not enough on utilities that burn coal. 
 Thomas Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy, which had sued the E.P.A., contesting how the rule allocated the pollution allowances among industries, said in an e-mail message, ''It was not the intent of Duke Energy's participation in this litigation to overturn E.P.A.'s Clean Air Interstate Rule.''
 Mr. Williams pointed out that North Carolina, where Duke has several power plants, enacted a law in 2002 that set limits on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide that were even tougher than those in the now-defunct federal rule.
 Bill Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, said on Friday that few states, aside from North Carolina, had laws that would fill the void created by the court ruling.
 ''Right now we find ourselves in the twilight zone,'' Mr. Dorsey, of Entergy, said. ''How do you proceed now? Do we continue to buy emissions allowances? Do we work on putting scrubbers on, or what?''
 Entergy backs a legislative remedy proposed by Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, that would set long-term limits on pollutants. 
 While industry and environmental lobbyists both expressed concerns about the impact of the court ruling, they divided along more customary lines on Friday's second decision, the declaration by Mr. Johnson of the E.P.A. that existing federal laws were ''ill-suited'' to the regulation of heat-trapping gases.
 The Association of International Automobile Manufacturers released a statement saying, in part, ''We share concerns that the Clean Air Act, which underwent its last major amendment 18 years ago, does not include all of the tools and criteria needed to address the global issue of climate change, including requirements to balance the economic effects and impacts on U.S. manufacturing jobs along with the environmental considerations.''
 Mr. Johnson alluded to the difficulty of applying the Clean Air Act, designed for conventional pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, to greenhouse gases. 
 Because interagency consensus could not be reached on a road map for such regulation, Mr. Johnson said, he was simultaneously publishing his staff's work and the comments of its critics, which had a definite tinge of hostility toward the E.P.A. regulators.
 For instance, the chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, James Connaughton, wrote that the E.P.A.'s staff ''myopically focuses on the Clean Air Act and ignores or understates major intended and unintended consequences that would flow from misapplying decades-old regulatory tools.'' 
 The final E.P.A. document, known as an advance notice of proposed rule making, did not contain a staff analysis about the economic benefits of regulation that had been in an earlier draft. That May 30 draft, which circulated widely in Washington, set the benefits of regulation at up to $2 trillion. The final version, based on the revised assumption that gasoline would cost about $2.20 per gallon in the foreseeable future, estimated the economic benefit at no more than about $830 billion.

HEADLINE: Putting Their Houses in Order

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG

 BODY:
Are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac nearly insolvent, as some investors and policy makers fear? Or are the giant mortgage finance companies sound -- and good investments, as others contend? 
 Those questions reverberated through Wall Street and Washington on Friday, when the two companies' shares fell yet again in a day of wild swings that left investors fearful of what might happen next. 
 But the questions are difficult to answer with any certainty because of the size and complexity of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, companies that lie at the heart of the nation's housing market and touch nearly one out of every two home mortgages. 
 Wall Street analysts disagree over how high the companies' losses will mount as home prices decline further and foreclosures grow, an outcome that depends on the course of the housing market and the broader economy. 
 Analysts also differ over what would happen if those losses were to overwhelm the companies, possibly leading to a rescue by the federal government that would be paid by taxpayers. 
 ''The real problem is that nobody really knows how bad things will get,'' said Thomas H. Stanton, an expert on the two companies who teaches a course on credit risk at Johns Hopkins University. 
 ''Everyone thought these guys were the best in the market at evaluating mortgages, so they let them skate by with huge debts and tiny financial cushions,'' Mr. Stanton said. ''But now it's less clear they knew what they were doing, and it's really hard to know who's right and who's selling pipe dreams and then hoping for the best.''
 Friday's market gyrations capped one of the most nerve-racking weeks on Wall Street since Bear Stearns collapsed into the arms of JPMorgan Chase in March. In recent days senior Bush administration officials disclosed a plan that would have the government take over one or both of the companies if they faltered.
 Minutes after trading opened Friday morning, the companies' shares plunged 50 percent. The shares then seemed to stabilize before rising and falling in a series of gut-wrenching waves. Freddie Mac ended the day at $7.75, down 3 percent, and Fannie Mae closed at $10.25, down 22 percent, rewarding both investors who bet on and against the enterprises during the course of the volatile day. 
 Supporters of Freddie and Fannie insisted that the worries over the companies' future were overblown. In Washington, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and members of Congress voiced confidence that the companies were healthy. On Wall Street, Citigroup broke with the prevailing public view among major investment houses, which mostly recommend that investors avoid Fannie and Freddie shares, and issued a report recommending that people buy them. 
 Freddie and Fannie buy mortgages from banks and other lenders. Sometimes they keep those mortgages as investment -- as of May, the two companies held mortgages worth about $1.5 trillion. Other times, they repackage the mortgages for sale to investors, along with a guarantee that Freddie and Fannie will pay off the loan if the homeowner defaults. The companies have guaranteed mortgages worth about $3.9 trillion.
 Among those who see trouble on the horizon, the prevailing concern is that Freddie and Fannie have vastly underestimated how many bad loans they have bought, and that as borrowers default, the companies will start hemorrhaging money.
 ''Odds are that things are going to get worse, and so far, no one has done a good job of estimating how bad they will get,'' said William Poole, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. ''By some methods of accounting, these companies have already reached zero value, or are almost there.''
 The companies themselves acknowledge that they bought many bad loans. In the past nine months, they have reported losses of more than $8 billion, and have estimated that those losses would grow by as much as $24 billion in the next few years. The firms estimate home prices will decline 7 percent to 9 percent over that period.
 Skeptics, however, maintain that even those dour forecasts are too optimistic. Ron Torrens, an analyst at the independent research firm BCA Research, estimates the companies' losses in 2008 and 2009 will total $52 billion. Other analysts have forecast losses in the next two years of as much as $100 billion. 
 In the worst-case situation, if the housing market were stagnant for years, total losses at Fannie and Freddie could reach $300 billion, or almost five times what the federal government spent on education last year, some analysts have predicted. If taxpayers were ever forced to guarantee the companies' debts and obligations, they could be on the hook for that money.
 ''The housing market is going to continue getting worse for years, and the losses are going to build and build,'' said Steve Persky, chief executive at Dalton Investments in Los Angeles. Mr. Persky did not estimate Fannie's and Freddie's losses. 
 ''Every time someone has tried to put a number on how much mortgage assets will decline, the market has proven that things are worse than they imagined,'' he added. 
 But Fannie and Freddie and their supporters say such pessimism is unwarranted. Supporters note that the companies have on hand more than $90 billion in reserves and funds they are required to hold by their regulator, and billions of dollars in revenue come in every year.
 ''These companies have their choice of the best loans right now, and we project they take in $8 billion to $10 billion of revenue each year, so they have more than enough revenue to offset their losses,'' said Howard Shapiro, an analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton, who estimates the companies will lose no more than a combined $40 billion during the next five years. 
 Whatever their losses, the companies will almost certainly need to raise additional money from investors before the end of the year. That will be difficult, however, given the uncertainty hanging over the companies.
 By law, Freddie and Fannie must hold a certain amount of so-called core capital in reserve, or else the government effectively takes control of the companies. Currently, the companies are required to hold about $70 billion in core capital. In his most recently released report, the companies' regulator, James B. Lockhart, said they held $81 billion at the end of March.
 But as Fannie and Freddie suffer losses, their core capital declines. To stay above the required levels, they must raise new funds to offset losses, or else they risk a regulatory takeover.
 The companies can raise money by selling new stock. But with their stock prices so low, they would have to issue millions of new shares to raise just $1 billion. As those millions of new shares are created, they depress the price of all the shares in the marketplace, creating a downward spiral that makes it harder and harder to raise money.
 Some onlookers are betting the government will step in and give the firms a cash infusion of taxpayer dollars. But in this market, nothing is certain.
 ''Everyone is playing a dangerous game right now,'' Mr. Persky said. ''And there's no clear evidence that anyone has consistently gotten it completely right.''

HEADLINE: When Big Becomes Too Big, a Dream House Goes to Auction

BYLINE: By ERIC KONIGSBERG

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn. 

 BODY:
By the time Stan and Dorothea Cheslock moved into their 26,000-square-foot dream house on 30 acres here, they were already dreaming of getting out.
 ''We kind of knew even before the house was finished that it was too much house for us,'' Mr. Cheslock, who made (and lost some of) a fortune in finance, explained the other evening as he showed a visitor around.
 ''We don't belong in it, basically,'' added Mrs. Cheslock, a former schoolteacher who prefers cooking to having a personal chef. ''It's like a Cinderella house. Hey, I got the prince, but the castle isn't for me.''
 More like a castle crossed with a palazzo, a lodge and maybe a manor with, as Mr. Cheslock put it, a ''kind of French-Mediterranean-Italian thing going on.'' The Cheslocks, who sold their previous home in Greenwich for $12 million, bought the property for $7 million in 2000, spent nearly $14 million and four years building the house, and put it on the market in 2006 for $31 million. No takers. 
 As the real estate market slowed and the overall economy worsened, the couple grew anxious, not least because a merchant banking firm that Mr. Cheslock co-owned lost $100 million in value, leaving his net worth at, by his own off-the-cuff accounting, ''something just under $100 million.'' 
 So, borrowing a page from the foreclosure world, the Cheslocks on Friday opened a five-week auction with bids starting at $19 million.
 ''Like two-thirds of what we think it's worth,'' Mrs. Cheslock said.
 Interested buyers must submit their bid, along with a $750,000 check, a purchase-and-sale agreement, and bank documents proving their wherewithal to the real estate agent by Aug. 15, after which the highest offer gets the house. 
 While sealed-bid auctions are common for properties foreclosed on by banks -- or vacant houses seized by municipalities -- they are a relatively new phenomenon for high-end properties. 
 But in a buyer's market, some sellers are attracted by the speed and certainty of the auction process: usually less than two months from start to finish and no negotiating. 
 The Cheslocks said research by their real estate brokers at Prudential shows that theirs is the most expensive house in history to go on the market this way.
 ''In Greenwich, I can say with some certainty that it's never been tried before,'' said Leslie McElwreath, a Sotheby's broker in town. ''Though it's becoming more common in the rest of the country with a tough market like this.''
 In addition to their broker, the Cheslocks have hired a marketing firm, an advertising company and publicists (who offered an ''exclusive'' to observe -- and, admittedly, be part of -- the process). 
 ''We specialize in what we like to call accelerated marketing,'' said Jon Gollinger, of the marketing firm whose efforts are charging the Cheslocks $200,000 plus 6 percent of the sale price, and specializes in sealed bids. ''Starting in 1999, I sold a lot of trophy hotels this way. It was almost too good to be true. The sellers would commit to a price point that was, in reality, below market rate. That would send a signal to the buying world that the property was going to trade. And the buyers, bottom line, would be in position to have a once-in-a-lifetime property for someone with their means.''
 The Cheslocks, who are in their 60s, met in junior high on Long Island, and have been married 40 years. He majored in English at Franklin and Marshall College and went to work on Wall Street analyzing municipal finance and then started a merchant banking firm, Cheslock, Bakker & Associates.
 Mrs. Cheslock taught public school in Greenwich for years. They have three children, all grown. Which means the house -- 6 bedrooms, 10 bathrooms (8 full, 2 half) -- is mostly empty.
 They take most of their meals at a small wooden table in the kitchen. ''It seats four, because it's round,'' Mrs. Cheslock says. ''That's two more than we are. The dining room is just too formal.'' Some of the fireplaces have never been used.
 They bid on the property, which is on a hill and includes a two-acre bass pond, the first day they looked at it. ''You look out the window and you can see Long Island and not another house,'' Mr. Cheslock said. ''There's nowhere else in Greenwich with this kind of privacy.'' 
 Mrs. Cheslock corrected him.
 ''Well, there's Conyers Farm, a gated community where most of the estates are 20 or 40 acres,'' she pointed out. ''But they built too many speed bumps. It takes so long to drive out of there.''
 When the Cheslocks bought the place -- named Hillcrest, though presumably for eight figures a new buyer assumes the right to rechristen it -- they lived in the existing house, ''a Brady Bunch house,'' in Mrs. Cheslock's words, until the new one was built.
 It took a year for the architect, Gilles LeGorrec, to design their house, and another to assemble all the materials. It was built out of hammerhead timber beams (''like Westminster Abbey,'' Mr. Cheslock said). The walls are made of 12-inch aerated autoclave concrete, which Mr. Cheslock saw in Europe and had shipped up from Georgia. ''The shipping was as expensive as the block,'' he said.
 The 2,500-square-foot terrace and balustrades around the house are made of granite he had shipped from China. The garage fits eight cars (on two levels). Down along the winding driveway are two bronze statues by Arturo Di Modica, the sculptor who made the charging bull near Wall Street. (''It's supposed to be two horses,'' Mrs. Cheslock noted, ''but it's a horse and a mutant.'')
 There is a wine cellar, a Siberian spruce sauna, an oak-paneled billiard room, a 50-foot lap pool and a French birdcage elevator that rises 40 feet from the great room to the cupola -- which, Mrs. Cheslock said, gets used ''every time somebody comes over and we ask them if they want to go up and see the cupola.''
 Mr. Cheslock said he used the pool every day, ''but the rest of the ground floor, not so much.''
 The ground floor -- too grand to call a basement -- was where things got carried away: a movie theater with a marquee that says ''cinema'' as well as a soda fountain, and an interior courtyard with fake windows, a trompe l'oeil ceiling, lampposts and cafe tables to resemble a Tuscan courtyard. 
 The mechanical room, however, is a thing of industrial beauty: thousands of control panels, covered wires, valves and pipes, four security screens and 42 radiator heat-zone monitors that control 10 miles of coils underground. 
 The upkeep, more than $200,000 a year, was part of what soured the dream.
 ''It needs a staff -- a chef and groundskeepers and gardeners,'' Mrs. Cheslock said. ''Trees, lawn, gardens, pool, deer-repelling. We have three different kinds of grounds teams. 
 ''My preference is to go someplace for a week or a month, and when the mold forms on the swimming pool, let the owners take care of it.''
 They have not decided where to move next -- just that it should be smaller.
 ''I would be happy with 3,500 square feet,'' Mrs. Cheslock said.
 ''I would need 7,000 square feet,'' said her husband.

HEADLINE: Coping With Food Prices, Africa Faces Another Rising Expense: Fuel

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: DAKAR, Senegal 

 BODY:
In the United States, where the median household income is about $48,000, $4-a-gallon gas is painful. 
 In Nigeria, most of whose 140 million citizens live on less than $2 a day despite their country's status as the world's eighth largest oil exporter, $5.50-a-gallon diesel is excruciating. 
 Daniel Idoko runs a small business center in Abuja, Nigeria's capital, and because the country's electricity supply is so balky, he relies on a diesel generator to run his computers, fax machines and copiers. The price of diesel has increased by 110 percent in the past few months, transforming his once prosperous small business from an asset to a liability. 
 ''I employ six people and pay rent for this shop, salaries, and I maintain equipment,'' Mr. Idoko said Friday, with a mix of frustration and resignation. ''How much do I have to make to break even?''
 Rising global food prices have sent discontent rippling across Africa in recent months, prompting riots and demonstrations from Zambia to Senegal, Tanzania to Niger. Now fuel prices are causing rumblings as well. On Friday, fuel tanker drivers in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, went on strike over rising prices of diesel fuel and poor road conditions, a move that could cripple the economy. 
 In Africa, fuel prices are a much less emotional issue than food prices. Food takes up 50 percent or more of a household's budget, but since most people do not have cars, the price of gas is meaningful only as it relates to bus and taxi fares.
 But now those are rising rapidly, too. In Namibia this week, bus and taxi drivers increased fares by 10 percent after the country's sixth fuel price increase this year. In Senegal, a ride in a private minibus that once cost 50 cents can now cost double that. 
 Fuel prices are also eroding the profits of businesses across Africa -- where a single breadwinner sometimes supports a dozen people or more -- hurting some of the neediest people in the world. Prices have risen so fast that they threaten to undermine the continent's nascent economic boom, which has been driven in large part by high prices for the natural resources that many countries export. 
 Benedicte Christensen, acting director of the International Monetary Fund's Africa department, told reporters earlier this month that price shocks had raised import costs across Africa, undermining growth.
 In Senegal, where power generation is largely dependent on diesel, the state-run electrical company has struggled to provide continuous power to large swaths of the country. Oumar Ba, a tailor who shares a large workshop with dozens of others here in Dakar, said the electricity was usually off half the day, cutting deeply into his income. 
 ''It is very hard to work like this,'' Mr. Ba said. ''But I have people in the village depending on me, so I try to keep going.''
 Countries that set national fuel prices, facing huge import expenses, have had to raise prices. Burundi, a tiny, impoverished nation that has suffered through civil war and mass killings, just raised its prices by 8 percent. Ivory Coast, a onetime regional economic powerhouse also struggling to recover from civil war, raised its fuel prices this week to more than $7 a gallon. 
 In Nigeria, where corruption and misrule have squandered, by some estimates, as much as $400 billion in oil profits over the past 40 years, cheap gas is nothing less than a birthright. But Nigeria's dilapidated refineries cannot produce enough gasoline to supply the country. The government imports about $4 billion a year of petroleum products. Government subsidies have kept regular gasoline selling for about $2 a gallon, but the price of diesel, crucial for businesses and heavy transport, has rapidly risen. 
 ''The cost of diesel is too much so we can't even use the generators any more,'' said Dennis Mbang, 35, a pharmacist in a military hospital in Lagos. ''The common man doesn't feel fine. The wealth is here, oil is here, but the masses are suffering.''
 High fuel costs are a particularly bitter pill for Nigeria because its own troubles have helped raise prices. Attacks on oil installations by militants in the oil-rich Niger Delta region have helped briefly to knock Nigeria out of its spot as Africa's top oil producer, in favor of Angola. 
 The International Monetary Fund's recent analysis of the effects of rising oil and food prices warned that at least 18 countries in Africa would be pushed to the tipping point by high fuel prices. 
 ''It is a potential source of instability, particularly when you combine the galloping price of petrol with food prices,'' said Philippe de Pontet, an analyst with the Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis consulting firm. 
 In Liberia, one of the world's poorest countries after 14 years of civil war, price increases for oil and food would consume almost all of the country's foreign reserves. Higher oil prices will cost Ghana, which has one of West Africa's most promising economies, 8.1 percent of its gross domestic product, according to the monetary fund.

HEADLINE: The High Price for a Drug, and Hope

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 When I read ''In Costly Cancer Drug, Hope and a Dilemma'' (''The Evidence Gap'' series, front page, July 6), I didn't know whether to cry or balk. 
 I can appreciate the attempt to educate the public about the difficult and emotional cost-benefit analysis of using drugs like Avastin. But I took issue with what I perceived as a somewhat condescending tone toward patients who, in spite of disappointing results, continue to put their hopes in Avastin. 
 My father is one such patient and is being treated off label with Avastin for a glioblastoma. We are not foolish, selfish or blind for putting our hope in this expensive and controversial treatment. 
 When all other available treatments have an even smaller chance of providing any benefit, Avastin's positive results -- however sparse -- are extremely valuable to us. 
 The hope this drug provides our family is just as important to prolonging my father's life as the drug itself. Like many affected by cancer, we are smart advocates who do our research and know the odds. But no doctor or research study has ever told my father that he couldn't be the outlier. Jana Jett Loeb 
 Milwaukee, July 6, 2008
 To the Editor:
 As an oncologist, I have personally observed no significant benefit from Avastin in my lung and colon cancer patients. It makes one wonder about all the hype and hope created by the drug companies in pursuit of their financial goals. 
 Drug companies are working in a constant campaign mode with the help of their deep pockets, lobbyists and a medical establishment that is more than eager to accept their money to churn out studies showing ''favorable results.'' In return, these companies shamelessly sell their drugs at exploitive costs. 
 These companies understand the system, including the Food and Drug Administration's approval process, and are using it without regard for whether there is a positive contribution to the health of the population in general and desperate cancer patients in particular. 
 Somebody needs to take bold steps to bring down the implausible price of these drugs. M. Ashraf Meelu
 Waldorf, Md., July 6, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The life of my wife, who had advanced lung cancer, was extended to 20 months, after receiving a prognosis of five months (she never smoked). We'll never know if it was Avastin, Tarceva or Taxol that extended her life. But if you ask our 7- or 5-year-old, those few extra months meant everything. 
 Our children will be stronger for the rest of their lives because of those few extra months she was able to be with them providing ever-lasting lessons and memories. One has to build that value in to the economic ethics equation.
 And what about the issue of how cancer research financing (particularly for lung cancer) has not benefited from the states' tobacco industry settlement? Of the $246 billion to be paid to states from the tobacco industry settlement, none was earmarked for cancer research, and so far most of the money received is being used for non-cancer-related programs. That is a travesty of economic ethics. Dennis Reilly 
 Wayland, Mass., July 6, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I'm walking on a bridge to hope. Without Avastin, I wouldn't have come within sight of the bridge. I've fought ovarian cancer for 13 years, since I was 42. The existing drugs no longer work, and the options left have dismal success rates.
 I tried Avastin in 2006. It kept me alive for 18 months with great quality of life, until the next drug came along. I'm now participating in a study for a new drug, and my tumors are shrinking. 
 Yet my success with Avastin isn't recorded, because there wasn't an appropriate study when I needed help. I'm thankful that the drug was available and consider myself one of the lucky ones, unlike my 195,000 sisters who have died from ovarian cancer since 1995.
 We need more Congressional financing for research, so we can keep moving to better medicines. Maureen Maker
 Denver, July 6, 2008
 To the Editor:
 My husband is one of the thousands of people taking Avastin off label, in his case for advanced non-clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma. At diagnosis he was expected to live four months; he is still with us two years later.
 In those two years he has reached the grand old age of 44, spent precious time with his parents, outlived a beloved dog, eaten Tex-Mex and played poker with friends, seen the rise of the first African-American with a real chance to win the presidency, and sustained me with his love. 
 Yes, the cost of Avastin is outrageous, and I am deeply grateful to my employer for covering it, but Avastin's gift of time is priceless. Perhaps we need a national conversation on how to finance biomedical innovation -- and hope. Erin Blair
 Houston, July 6, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The Avastin story points out the sad fact that both patients and society are victims of the law of diminishing returns: paying more and more for marginal, often questionable results while venture capitalists reap the real returns. 
 Continuing to finance our health care needs by rewarding highly profitable companies simply assures that people whose interest is making the ''big bucks'' will be the ones drawn into the medical field, perpetuating a system whose primary beneficiaries increasingly are the suppliers rather than the patients.
 We've been duped into believing that without outrageous costs and profits, medical progress would grind to a standstill. Let's hope this will be the next economic bubble to burst. Mark Miller 
 Seattle, July 10, 2008
 The writer is a medical doctor.
 To the Editor:
 Your article about Avastin did not mention one very important use for this drug: the treatment of ''wet'' age-related macular degeneration and other eye diseases complicated by the growth of abnormal blood vessels. This off-label use of Avastin has become the standard of care throughout the world, and the results can only be called miraculous. 
 I have many patients who would be legally blind but are continuing to live their lives, reading and driving, because of Avastin. In addition, because the dose of Avastin used in the eye is a fraction of that used systemically, the monthly cost for the drug is approximately $50, compared with about $1,800 for Lucentis, a drug with similar properties also manufactured by Genentech.

HEADLINE: Experts Point to Deceptions In Military Display by Iran

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD; Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
Iran's war games this week featured more bluff and exaggeration than displays of menacing new power, military analysts said Friday.
 The half-truths, the analysts said, included not only a doctored photo of a salvo firing but also misleading statements about the range of the largest missile and two videos that made the firings seem more numerous and fearsome than they really were.
 ''Deception was rampant,'' said Charles P. Vick, an expert on the Iranian missile program at GlobalSecurity.org, a research group in Alexandria, Va. ''The bottom line is that the Iranians are tweaking our noses.'' 
 The missile firings on Wednesday and Thursday shook the oil markets, helping drive up the price of crude to a record of more than $147 a barrel on Friday from $136 on Wednesday. That rise, if sustained, would mean billions of added dollars for Iran, one of the world's top oil exporters.
 Graham Allison, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, estimated that the oil price increase would add up to $25 million a day to Iran's economy and wondered if that was accidental or deliberate.
 Aside from the theater of the missile firings and the prospect of windfall oil revenues, Mr. Allison said, ''the question is, Does this represent any significant advance in any relevant military capability to do any damage? And I think the best judgment is, no.''
 The Iranians, he added, ''have a history of puffing out their chests and pounding on them.''
 Analysts said an Iranian photograph released Wednesday that showed four missiles heading skyward had been digitally altered to make three firings look like four. The image appeared on the front pages of many newspapers and Web sites. Thursday, the Iranians released a photo showing what appeared to be the same scene, but with a grounded missile that may have failed. 
 Descriptions of the big weapon in the extravaganza were also misleading, the analysts said. Iran's Arabic-language Al Alam television said the Shahab-3 had a range of 2,000 kilometers or about 1,250 miles. Many news reports carried that description.
 Analysts said that extended range was true of the Shahab-3b. But the missile that the Iranians actually fired Wednesday, they added, was a less advanced model known as the Shahab-3a, which has a range of about 1,500 kilometers, or roughly 900 miles.
 ''They do systematically try to exaggerate the range,'' Geoffrey E. Forden, a missile expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said of Iranian descriptions of the Shahab. But he noted that the Shahab-3a could still ''hit Israel.''
 Analysts said the Shahab-3a was no longer in production.
 Mr. Vick of GlobalSecurity.org cited two cases involving Iranian videos of the missile launchings that, by accident or design, had magnified the threat.
 The first, he said, involved the nighttime firing of a missile that spewed a distinctive trail of fiery debris. Iranian television, he said, broadcast ''two or three different views of the same thing, which gave the false impression of multiple firings.''
 The second instance, Mr. Vick said, involved the firing Wednesday of the Shahab-3a and, a few seconds later, what analysts initially believed was a second Shahab. A dual launching would have been a major advance. But closer inspection showed the second missile to be a Scud-C, the range of which is far less. The Iranian video, Mr. Vick said, used a misleading perspective that made ''the Scud-C look like a Shahab.'' The only clue to their identities was their color, he said, the Scud green and the Shahab tan.
 Overall, Mr. Vick concluded, the two days of missile firings represented no escalation over what the Iranians have done before in previous tests.
 ''I remain unimpressed,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Spa Treatment to Clean the Car and Energize the Driver

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III. 
E-mail: pursuits@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I WHIPPED my black-on-black 2007 Chevy TrailBlazer into the driveway of the Englewood Auto Spa in Englewood, N.J., in executive pursuit of vehicular purification. 
 It was shortly before noon on a summer day with the treacherous trifecta of heat, humidity and haze foretelling afternoon thundershowers. The auto spa promised to give my S.U.V. the kind of complete body-to-soul makeover ordinarily associated with upscale health resorts.
 Lord knows, we both needed it. My TrailBlazer seemed to mirror the existential turmoil I had suffered in the wake of a marital breakup that had exiled me to Chateau Bow Wow, a k a the Doghouse, for the foreseeable future. 
 White-streaked dents bruised the front and rear fenders and the driver's side door. The interior reeked of stale cigars, spilled coffee and decomposing dreams. The hood was so caked with road dust that someone had finger-painted it with the exhortation, ''Clean Me!'' 
 Leo Diaz, 28, the pony-tailed proprietor of the auto spa, greeted me with a persuasive sales pitch. This was no ''10-minute slosh, slap, bust your antenna and scratch your paint'' car wash, he declared. It was a detailing center that offered the automotive equivalents of manicures, pedicures, massages, facials and, of course, waxes. 
 Prices ranged from $39.95 for a 30-minute job to $399 for a six-hour deluxe treatment. Celebrity clients included the actor John Travolta, the comedian Chris Rock and the singer Mary J. Blige, my idea of the ideal company to take on a cross-country road trip.
 ''Once you detail your car, you get better gas mileage because the wind blows through smoother,'' Mr. Diaz said. His deadpan expression dissolved into a mischievous grin, and I knew he had me.
 After noting with all due respect that my TrailBlazer was ''an everyday car, not a Rolls or a Bentley,'' Mr. Diaz recommended an intermediately priced $199 treatment called the Pebble Beach Detail, which takes about three hours. ''People are always asking me why I charge so much, but you'll see when it's finished that it's worth it,'' he promised.
 As I watched Mr. Diaz steer my TrailBlazer through the garage door entrance of his detailing shop, I was overcome with postpartum depression. When I was growing up, cars were a source of freedom and joy. Now they seem to augur the death of the American way of life. 
 The price of crude oil is about $145 a barrel, and gasoline is more than $4 a gallon. The price of General Motors stock is under $10 a share, and there are rumors the company may declare bankruptcy. Hey, I'd have to sell more than 20 shares of G.M. just to pay for my detailing.
 Along with gas stations, convenience stores and drive-through fast-food franchises, the car wash is a fixture on the nation's roadways. It's also one of the last industries still dominated by small businesses. In 2007, there were 54,030 car washes in the United States, and 75 percent of those had only one employee, usually the owner/operator, according to a report by the forecasting firm IBISWorld. All told, the car wash industry generated $8.16 billion in revenue and employed 176,790 people.
 Washing cars is still a predominantly do-it-yourself activity. The IBISWorld report estimates that 53 percent of car washes are either coin-operated self-service bays, where customers use wands, hoses and vacuums to clean their own vehicles, or the automatic rollover car washes where customers remain in their vehicles while a mechanical boom does the washing. An additional 39 percent of car washes are conveyor operations where vehicles are moved through tunnels equipped with mechanized brushes and finished by employees with hand towels.
 Detailing operations like the Englewood Auto Spa account for only 8 percent of the car wash industry, but there is no dispute that their hand-cleaning techniques do the most thorough job. Optional services often include minor dent repair and touch-up painting. Mr. Diaz said that he might add some human touch-up options. ''I'm thinking about hiring a massage therapist,'' he said. 
 Although the Englewood spa's customers are typically required to remain in the lobby area, Mr. Diaz agreed to let me participate in every phase of the detailing process in the name of research and emotional rescue. 
 The most enjoyable part for me was the prep work. Under Mr. Diaz's supervision, I soaped the tires of my TrailBlazer and scrubbed them with a wire-bristled brush until I could read the manufacturer's logo. Then I sprayed the exterior and the door jambs with a high-pressure water gun. 
 The power I felt as I blasted away grime was addictive. But any fantasies of replicating that feeling at home evaporated when Mr. Diaz informed me that the compressor for the water gun cost more than $600.
 To my chagrin, Mr. Diaz insisted that I also wash the engine. ''One, it looks good,'' he said. ''And two, you can't spot leaks or cracked hoses if your engine isn't clean.''
 After half an hour or so, two employees and I mopped up the water dripping from my TrailBlazer with sponges and cloths that were made of microfiber, rather than cotton, so that they would not scratch the paint. Then Mr. Diaz drove my TrailBlazer to the rubber-matted detail area, where we spent the next two and a half hours going over virtually every inch of it at least twice.
 We sprayed more water on the exterior and rubbed the surface with a gray clay compound to remove imperfections from the paint. We used light sandpaper to take out little nicks. We used a nail polish brush to apply black touch-up paint to the white scratches on the front and rear fenders and the driver's side door. 
 We squirted out two complete layers of polish compound that cost $50 a gallon, and spread them with electric buffers that looked and sounded like buzz saws. Then we applied a premium brand Zymol wax that costs $49 a jar. 
 We attacked the interior with air hoses, blowing out the seats seam by seam and excavating particles of petrified cream cheese, shredded Sweet 'N Low packets, the wings of one of my 10-year-old son's Lego creatures and three pennies found face down. 
 Then one of the employees layered the palms of his hands with a white leather conditioner and rubbed it into each seat. ''You have to do it by hand because a towel will absorb the nutrients and they won't go into the leather,'' Mr. Diaz said.
 Around half past 2, I heard a rumble of thunder and saw raindrops falling outside. Mr. Diaz assured me that our efforts would not be in vain. ''I have customers who come here to get their cars washed in the middle of a rainstorm,'' he said. ''The wax is so good that the water runs right off.'' 
 A few minutes later, the rain stopped, and the sun poked through the clouds. The formerly dust-caked exterior of my TrailBlazer was now so shiny that I could see my reflection in the body panels in microscopic detail. 
 I climbed behind the wheel and beheld an interior more immaculate than the breeze after the storm. Then I inhaled the bittersweet aroma often referred to as new-car smell. It must have gone right to my head because I forgot all about my domestic difficulties and felt a rush that I can only describe as pure cleanliness. 
 I thanked Mr. Diaz and his staff, and headed up the street to a gas station, where I paid a whopping $85 for a fillup. I figured on suffering additional economic and emotional shocks when I returned to Long Island. 
 But even if I couldn't afford to escape my existential blues by taking a cross-country road trip with John Travolta, Chris Rock and Mary J. Blige, I took solace in knowing that my TrailBlazer would sure look good in the driveway.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths TSAI, GERALD

 BODY:
 TSAI--Gerald , loving friend of 57 years, consummate gentleman, brilliant businessman. You will be greatly missed. My deepest sympathies to your children and grandchildren. Robert Weltz, 415 Hot Springs Road., Montecito, CA TSAI--Gerald, Jr., 79, resident of Manhattan and Rye, NY, died peacefully July 9, 2008. Beloved father of Christopher and Veronica. 
Caring grandfather of Vanessa O'Brien. Jerry was an enormously talented and successful businessman, serving as a Chairman, President and Chief Executive officer of several large publicly traded companies. He was known as a highly gifted analytical problem solver and a skilled negotiator. His understanding of the capital markets was unparalleled, recognizing opportunities where others saw confusion. Jerry was born in Shanghai, China, on March 10, 1929, and attended St. John's Middle School and St. John's University. He came to the United States in 1947 and, after one semester at Wesleyan University, transferred to Boston University, where he earned both a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the College of Liberal Arts and a Master of Arts in Economics from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1949. In addition, Jerry attended courses at the School of Management. Jerry began his distinguished investment career in 1951 as a security analyst at Bache & Company. A year later, he joined the Boston firm of Fidelity Management and Research Company, Inc., as a security analyst. After only six years, at the age of 29, he started the Fidelity Capital Fund, Fidelity's first public growth fund. He has been credited as one of the main initiators of the modern performance fund idea. At Fidelity he rapidly rose through the corporate ranks, ascending to Assistant Vice President of Fidelity Fund, Inc., to Vice President, to director and Executive Vice President of the company in 1963. In 1965, Jerry established the Tsai Management & Research Corporation and Manhattan Fund, which proved to be a huge success. The initial offering was planned for $25 million but the public's response was so enthusiastic that the fund was greatly oversubscribed and $247 million in shares were sold. He joined CNA Financial Corp in 1967 as President and served until 1973. Jerry was also Chairman of Associated Madison Companies, lnc., the cornerstone of Primerica's financial services business, He joined Primerica Corporation, then American Can Company, as Executive Vice President of financial services and as a member of the company's Board of Directors in 1982, when the company acquired Associated Madison in its first move into the financial services industry. He rose to Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, becoming the first ChineseAmerican to lead a company in the Dow Jones Industrials Index. He became the principal strategist in building Primerica's financial services businesses, which included the purchase of Smith Barney in 1987. Jerry was a devoted son, and regularly sought out his mother's advice before making a major business decision. For instance, Ruth encouraged him to join Primerica, despite his reservations, and then backed his idea of acquiring Smith Barney. He often said that her faith in him have gave him the confidence to succeed. From 1993 to 1997, he served as Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Delta Life Corporation, a life insurance; and annuity company. Jerry also served on the boards of several companies, including United Rentals, lnc., Sequa Corp., Zenith National Insurance Corp., Triarc Companies, Inc. Apollo Investment Corp., and Saks Inc. In addition to his business successes Jerry was a highly distinguished member of the community serving on a variety of philanthropic boards including the Boston University Board of Trustees and the Norton Museum of Art Board of Trustees. He also served as a trustee of the New York University Medical Center and School of Medicine Foundation Board. He was a member of the Board of Overseers of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Jerry has been honored for his philanthropic and humanitarian work, receiving a Doctor of Humane Letters from Boston University in 2003. He received the Man of the Year Award from the Chinatown Planning Council of New York and the Boston University Alumni Award for Distinguished Public Service to the Profession in 1985. Jerry was an Associate Founder of Boston University, and served on the Board of Trustees for many years. He was a trustee emeritus at the time of his death. Funeral services will be held Saturday, July 12, 5pm, at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel 1076 Madison Ave., New York, NY. TSAI--Jerry. Jerry was a major influence in my life. In 1967, I asked him what firm I could go to so that I would be paid an equal salary to what men were being paid. He first said don't be ridiculous, and then advised me to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and work for myself. On December 28, 2007, he joined me on the podium as I rang the ''Closing Bell'' at the NYSE in celebration of my 40th anniversary. Jerry gave me this brilliant idea, and I have always given him the credit for being the Inspiration behind my success. I will miss Jerry -he was a unique and very special person. Muriel ''Mickie'' Siebert TSAI--Gerald. To a very very special friend and a wonderful man who did more for his friends than himself. Gerald Tsai will be greatly missed. Fondly, Elaine Sargent TSAI--Gerald Jr. Dear Jerry, we miss our Sunday night diners and will think of you then, especially hearing of your deep respect, love and admiration for your mother. Marilyn and Bob TSAI--Gerald, Jr., 79. The Board of Directors of Apollo Investment Corporation offers its deepest and heartfelt condolences to the family of Gerald Tsai, Jr. on his recent passing. He was a beloved friend and a valuable member of our Board since its inception. He will be greatly missed. John Hannan, Chairman

HEADLINE: Pop Tours Still Sell, Despite Economy

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
For the music industry these days, flat is good.
 Despite inflation, rising gasoline prices and the continuing slide of record sales, concert tours from January to June grossed $1.05 billion in North America, the same as the midyear gross in 2007, according to a report this week by Pollstar, a trade magazine. 
 Bon Jovi topped the list with a gross of $56.3 million, followed by Bruce Springsteen, with $40.8 million, and Van Halen, with $36.8 million. 
 But with grim economic forecasts, many in the industry are bracing for a sharp downturn for the rest of the summer and the fall. 
 ''Everybody's nervous,'' said Gary Bongiovanni, the editor of Pollstar. ''If you look at the parade of bad economic news we've seen in the first six months of the year, we're doing better than we should be. When is the bottom going to drop?''
 Because tickets for the most popular tours are often bought months in advance, sales for recent shows may not reflect the jump in fuel prices over the last couple of months. The true test, according to concert promoters, booking agents and others, will be over the next few months, as consumers decide whether to buy tickets for the fall.
 ''There's been a delayed effect,'' said Randy Phillips, the chief executive of AEG Live, the second-largest promoter (after Live Nation). ''Most of these shows went on public sale in February, March and April, and it wasn't as dire as it got right after that.''
 Not everyone in the industry is so worried. Live Nation is doing strong business on some of its most important tours, said Jason Garner, its chief executive for North American music. Madonna's tour, which begins in Europe next month and comes to the United States in October, is already 90 percent sold out, he said. (Last fall Madonna signed a multifaceted deal with Live Nation worth a reported $120 million, covering recorded music, tours and merchandise.) Coldplay's summer dates are also 90 percent sold out, and the New Kids on the Block reunion, starting in September, is at 80 percent, a Live Nation spokesman said. 
 ''The data so far this year suggests that the concert business is as healthy as it's been,'' Mr. Garner said.
 In addition to rock and pop, country acts placed high on the Pollstar list. Kenny Chesney is No. 4, with $35.3 million; Rascal Flatts No. 8, with $25.4 million; and the bill of Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood grossed $18.5 million to reach No. 11. With the exception of Kanye West (No. 6, with $31.6 million) and the Jay-Z and Mary J. Blige tour (No. 7, $30.7 million), hip-hop is largely absent.
 Mr. Garner said most concertgoers attend only a few shows a year but can be reliable ticket buyers for their favorite acts. Midyear sales for the last three years have been fairly steady after low numbers in 2004 and 2005.
 Grosses might be holding steady, but attendance has been slipping for years, as the industry has remained profitable by selling fewer tickets for more money. The total number of tickets sold in the first half of 2008 fell by 5.6 percent to 16.9 million, though that was offset by a 5.9 percent increase in prices. The average ticket price for Bon Jovi, for example, was $88, and for Jay-Z and Ms. Blige it was $111.
 Mr. Bongiovanni said high prices made the business vulnerable if the economy continues to curb discretionary spending. 
 ''When times are tight, and there are fewer of those dollars around,'' he said, ''the first thing that's going to get cut is a $200 concert ticket.''
 The concert industry is based on tight margins. Much of the face value of a ticket -- up to 90 percent, or even more for the biggest acts -- goes to the artists. That forces promoters to rely on ancillary sales, like food, merchandise and parking. Those sales are also threatened by a souring economy, said David B. Kestenbaum, a media analyst with the investment banking firm Morgan Joseph.
 ''People will still pay for the top artists,'' Mr. Kestenbaum said, ''but they may not spend as much at the concert.''

HEADLINE: By Large Margin, Senate Votes to Help Homeowners and Overhaul Loan Agencies

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; David Stout contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate overwhelmingly approved a package of housing bills on Friday, including a rescue plan aimed at helping hundreds of thousands of borrowers avoid foreclosure and a regulatory overhaul for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the battered mortgage finance companies. 
 The new rules include the creation of an independent regulator with broad authority to order the companies to raise capital and even, if necessary, to put one or both in receivership and assume control of their operations. 
 The bill now returns to the House, where related tax provisions and other details need to be worked out. Supporters of the Senate bill urged the House to approve the bill quickly. 
 ''It's time for us to do something in a real way to move this government forward on the side of homeowners and on the side of the economy,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. ''Let's really move forward as quickly as we can to give confidence to the American people.'' 
 The Senate approved the bill 63 to 5 in the third in a series of procedural votes. The House approved its version in May, and though the White House has issued a formal veto threat -- and repeated it on Friday -- administration officials have indicated that a compromise was likely. 
 Previous votes on the housing bills showed that a presidential veto could easily be overridden. 
 Until the shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac went into free fall this week, the main focus of the legislation was the foreclosure rescue plan, which aims to help as many as 400,000 troubled borrowers refinance with more affordable, 30-year fixed-rate loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration. 
 But this week, there was renewed attention on the provisions in the bill that overhaul regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-chartered mortgage finance companies. 
 Under the legislation, an independent agency called the Federal Home Finance Agency would be created to oversee the mortgage companies. Its director would also be a member of a four-person oversight board, along with the Treasury secretary, the secretary of housing and urban development and the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee, said that the new regulator could require the companies to raise new capital and clarify their two-part mission: to provide a return for investors and to provide market liquidity and capital to expand homeownership. 
 ''That dual mission, you want to make sure that is going to be pursued,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''And a strong regulator helps you get there.'' 
 Mr. Dodd hailed the vote on Friday as a crucial step and praised the measure as ''the most important housing legislation in a generation.''
 The foreclosure rescue bill would authorize the housing administration to insure up to $300 billion in refinanced mortgages, enabling borrowers now saddled with unaffordable loans to refinance. To take part in the program, lenders would first have to agree to lower each homeowner's debt obligation to 90 percent of a home's current value. 
 Approval in the Senate came after two weeks of procedural wrangling, forced by Senate Republicans, over unrelated measures. As a result, Democrats were forced to schedule votes on Friday afternoon. Votes on Fridays are rare because most lawmakers would prefer to be in their home states or on their way there.
 The five opposing votes came from Western Republican senators: John Thune of South Dakota; Jon Kyl of Arizona; Michael D. Crapo of Idaho; and Michael B. Enzi and John Barrasso, both of Wyoming. 
 There has been little doubt among members of both parties that the housing legislation would be approved before Congress left for its summer recess in August. But even as the housing market has continued to decline, lawmakers have not been in much of a rush. 
 Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is a main author of the housing package, said on Thursday that he hoped to get House approval as quickly as possible and return the bill to the Senate, where it would need one final vote before being sent to the White House for President Bush's signature. 
 In its statement on Friday reiterating its veto threat, the White House said it remained concerned about a provision providing nearly $4 billion in grants to local governments for the purchase and rehabilitation of foreclosed property.

HEADLINE: Rival South America Leaders Meet

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia 

 BODY:
It seemed like just yesterday that President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela was calling President Alvaro Uribe of Colombia a ''pawn of the American empire'' and comparing him to Don Vito Corleone, with Mr. Uribe lashing back by threatening to sue Mr. Chavez for the ''financing of genocidists.'' 
 But the name calling was put aside Friday when the two leaders met in Venezuela, trying to mend relations after months of bickering over issues ranging from Colombia's claims that Mr. Chavez tried to finance leftist guerrillas to Venezuela's ire over the possible transfer of an American military base to Colombia from Ecuador.
 ''Today begins a new stage,'' said Mr. Chavez after meeting alone with Mr. Uribe for several hours in Paraguana, an oil-refining center in northwestern Venezuela. They did not go into much detail about the content of their meeting, their first since relations soured last year.
 Political analysts in Bogota and Caracas attributed the encounter to growing economic concerns in both countries, with trade between Colombia and Venezuela valued at as much as $6 billion a year. Venezuela relies on Colombian imports of food, manufactured goods and natural gas, while these industries account for thousands of jobs in Colombia.
 Rising inflation in both countries, meanwhile, has accentuated worries in Venezuela over food shortages and in Colombia over increasing food prices. There is also concern in Colombia over a decline in remittances from some of the estimated 4 million Colombians living in Venezuela.
 ''Uribe is a realist who knows that Colombia and Venezuela need each other,'' said Myles Frechette, a former United States ambassador to Colombia. 
 ''And for the United States, it doesn't do a lot of good for this ally to be a pariah in the region,'' he said, referring to fallout from Colombia's cross-border raid in Ecuador on a guerilla camp.
 Mr. Chavez's invitation to Mr. Uribe, a staunch ally of the Bush administration, was an unexpected move. This week, he had to upbraid the Venezuelan Communist Party, part of his own political base, over plans to support protests of Mr. Uribe's visit. 
 Mr. Chavez also called on Colombia's FARC rebel group to lay down its arms. Colombia has used computer files recovered from the rebels to demonstrate Venezuelan support for the FARC, claims that have been disputed by Venezuela.
 While they appeared stiff upon greeting one another on Friday, Mr. Chavez and Mr. Uribe both tried to appear prepared to reconcile, symbolically at least. Mr. Uribe gave his Venezuelan counterpart books about Simon Bolivar, the Latin American liberation hero at the heart of Mr. Chavez's integrationist political philosophy, while Mr. Chavez offered Mr. Uribe a portrait of Bolivar.

HEADLINE: There He Goes Again

 BODY:
This has been a week in which the stock markets lurched sickeningly downward. The treasury secretary had to swat away rumors that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the pillars of the mortgage business, may be crumbling. Oil prices spiked, again. Airlines cut schedules and raised prices, again. And the best that could be said about one of the nation's biggest companies, General Electric, was that it didn't do worse in the second quarter than Wall Street had expected.
 All of that made it more clear than ever why this nation desperately needs the next president to have a clear-eyed vision for the economy -- and the federal budget in particular. And yet, the biggest news that Senator John McCain made last week was his renewal of a pledge to balance the federal budget by 2013. How? Who knows? 
 Mr. McCain's main campaign promises, if fulfilled, would lead to huge budget deficits. Extending the Bush tax cuts, enacting more tax cuts of his own and staying the course in Iraq would cost hundreds of billions of dollars more, every year, than the small bore spending cuts he has specified. Mr. McCain cannot balance the budget on a crusade against pork and a one-year freeze in a sliver of federal spending. Either he has a secret plan to balance the budget or he's blowing smoke. 
 It is safe to assume there is no secret plan. To balance the budget in the face of ever-increasing tax cuts would require untenable near-term cuts in Medicare, one of the biggest drivers of budget imbalance. That, in turn, would harm elderly Americans, arguably Mr. McCain's most important constituency. 
 Do not misunderstand our argument. Controlling Medicare costs is essential to restoring budget health. But no politician, least of all Mr. McCain, is simply going to slash the life out of the program. Even reform of Social Security, which Mr. McCain has also promised and which also must occur to restore long-term fiscal balance, would not right the budget anytime soon. Any feasible reform (not that Mr. McCain has one) would have to phase in over decades. 
 Which leads us to conclude that Mr. McCain is merely talking the balanced-budget talk. 
 Mr. McCain and his advisers must know that his numbers do not add up. But adding up is not their point. Their point is to perpetuate the fantasy that Americans can have ever bigger tax cuts and a balanced federal budget. They cannot. The unbalanced budgets of the Reagan years and two Bush presidencies are proof.
 No one -- not presidents, not members of Congress, not the voters -- has ever been willing, and rightly so, to starve government to the point that would make never-ending tax cuts affordable. But feeding the fantasy is easier than presenting tough choices, and it worked for Mr. McCain's Republican predecessors. 
 Following in those footsteps does not, however, make a good case for his candidacy. Americans face hardship in the years to come. The demands of a tanking economy, coming on top of years of unmet needs -- for health care, infrastructure repair and alternative energy, to name a few -- will require the next president to spend more and to raise taxes to support that spending. A blanket commitment to cutting tax cuts while balancing the budget precludes sensible discussion of how to do that. 
 Longer term, the challenge is perhaps even more daunting. Saving more is ultimately the only way to dig out of the budget hole that the nation is in. That will be painful, because higher government savings, done properly, means higher taxes and restrained spending. Candidates for president do not like to be pessimistic, or even candid, really, about the economy. But a leader who wants to steer the nation through tough times should not spend the campaign telling Americans they can have it all.

HEADLINE: South Korean Offer to North Is Marred by Killing of Tourist

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
President Lee Myung-bak reversed his tough approach on North Korea on Friday and offered to resume dialogue and provide humanitarian aid, but the move was immediately clouded by the fatal shooting of South Korean woman by a North Korean soldier in the North's tourism enclave.
 A tourism company reported that the woman was shot shortly before dawn on Friday after wandering into a fenced-off military area near Diamond Mountain, a tourism zone that was opened to South Koreans in 1998. 
 South Korea immediately suspended visits to the zone, which is a symbol of cross-border reconciliation. Nearly two million South Koreans have visited Diamond Mountain, a scenic spot at the southeastern tip of North Korea. 
 Mr. Lee was informed of the shooting an hour and a half before he was to make his first speech to Parliament as president, his aides said. 
 He pressed ahead with his reconciliation overture, though, saying, ''Full dialogue between the two Koreas must resume.'' 
 He told lawmakers that his government was ''willing to engage in serious consultations'' on how to implement accords that the two previous South Korean presidents, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, reached with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, in 2000 and 2007.
 There was no immediate North Korean reaction to Mr. Lee's speech or the shooting. It was not clear whether the death of the tourist, identified as Park Wang-ja, would alter Mr. Lee's offer. 
 Mr. Lee, whose election last December returned conservatives to power after a decade, had shown reservations bordering on disregard for the agreements negotiated by his predecessors. 
 His reversal came amid mounting domestic and international pressure to soften his policies. Buffeted by weeks of protests against his decision to lift a ban on importing American beef, Mr. Lee was being pressed by his liberal rivals to improve relations with the North at a time when the United States was engaging Mr. Kim.
 On Friday, Mr. Lee stopped short of saying he was bound by his predecessors' agreements and reiterated that the South's priority was disarmament. He hinted that the North would get no major economic aid unless progress was made in ending its nuclear weapons programs.
 Still, his overture appeared to indicate flexibility. Since his election, he had limited his comments on the issue to the possibility of a ''review'' of the inter-Korean accords, which promised shipyards, roads, rail assistance and other multibillion-dollar projects for the North. He had also ruled out expanding joint economic projects already under way, such as Kaesong, an industrial complex north of Seoul and a symbol of reconciliation. 
 His position had infuriated North Korea, which considered it an insult to Mr. Kim. 
 Calling Mr. Lee a ''sycophant'' and a ''traitor'' in April, the North cut off all official dialogue with the South, ordered South Korean officials to leave Kaesong and demanded a declaration from Mr. Lee that he would honor the agreements. 
 With his campaign promise of a tougher policy on North Korea, Mr. Lee won the support of South Koreans who had complained that the North had been coddled with aid that won few concessions. 
 But last month, North Korea submitted a partial accounting of its nuclear programs; the United States moved to take North Korea off its terrorism blacklist and relax some economic sanctions.
 Japan also agreed to lift some sanctions, while the North reopened an investigation into abductions of Japanese citizens.
 The United States began shipping 500,000 tons of food aid to North Korea this month. On Friday, the Unicef was headed to the North's isolated northeastern provinces two years after being ordered out. 
 When South Korea recently offered to ship 50,000 tons of corn, the impoverished North said it did not need the South's help, leading some critics in South Korea to charge that Mr. Lee's policy had backfired.
 ''He thought North Korea would buckle under a hard-line policy, but it didn't happen,'' said Cho Seong-ryoul, an analyst at the Institute for National Security Strategy in Seoul. ''Change in his policy became inevitable.''
 Mr. Cho said Mr. Lee disappointed many conservative supporters, including aging South Koreans who seek to be reunited with their relatives in the North and businessmen who had hoped to relocate their labor-intensive factories to Kaesong.
 On Friday, Mr. Lee said he was ready to help relieve the food shortage in the North. In return, he proposed reunions of aging Koreans separated by the 1950-53 Korean conflict.
 Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at the Sejong Institute, a research organization in Seoul, had predicted the failure of Mr. Lee's hard-line policy. He said the president's overture on Friday would not win any immediate response from the North because it lacked specifics, such as a commitment to expand the Kaesong complex. 
 Mr. Lee's government badly needs a success. Amid rising oil prices, it was forced to scale back the economic growth target for this year. The crisis heightened when large crowds spilled out in recent weeks to protest American beef imports.
 ''The beef fiasco showed to him that he cannot overcome the crisis by dividing the country further over North Korea,'' Mr. Cheong said.
 In Beijing, six-nation talks on the North's nuclear programs entered their second day on Friday, with negotiators discussing North Korea's complaint that it had not received most of the energy aid it had been promised.
 A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, reported progress. ''Just what are the specific agreements on verification, I think the six parties will make an announcement soon,'' Mr. Qin said at a news conference.

HEADLINE: A Shift in Obama's Strategy, or in His Beliefs?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 If Barack Obama is a really wise man -- and the jury is still out on that -- he will pay a great deal of attention to ''Lurching With Abandon,'' by Bob Herbert (column, July 8).
 Having secured the Democratic nomination, Mr. Obama appears to be giving up, one after another, the positions that galvanized his supporters and won that victory. On the Iraq war, on government surveillance, on the separation of church and state, on this disastrous Supreme Court, Mr. Obama appears to be tacking toward the center. He is abandoning those firmly stated principles that created his political movement. 
 For Mr. Obama to lose in November, it's not necessary for his core supporters to vote for John McCain; all they have to do is not continue to work and spend on his behalf, or not vote at all. 
 Faced with a choice between a real Republican and a fake Republican, the voters will always be smart enough to opt for the real one.
 Ron Bonn San Diego, July 8, 2008
 To the Editor:
 As a Democrat who is antiwar, pro-choice, anti-gun, anti-government spying, and for the separation of church and state, to name only a few of my positions, I am an enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama. 
 Of course he is a politician. He would never have become a candidate for the presidency of the United States if he weren't a politician.
 Susan Stern Newton, Mass., July 8, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The question, as framed in Washington circles, is, Do you want to do what it takes to win the White House, or be precious about your principles and lose?
 This ignores the fact that Barack Obama was doing quite well in the polls, thank you, before he moved to the so-called center. It's another case of Democrats not having the capacity to take yes for an answer. After years in the wilderness, they find it incomprehensible that the center seems to have come to them. 
 In poll after poll, respondents prefer the Democratic position over the Republican one. All Democrats have to do is stand by their positions and push their advantage the way Republicans have been doing for decades.
 But no. Back to cowering. And in the process, they blur the lines between their candidate and the Republican because, after all, Republicans win elections, right?
 Shel Khipple Wilmette, Ill., July 8, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The claims that Barack Obama has changed his positions seem to be exaggerated. 
 He has worked with religious-based initiatives since his days as a community organizer in Chicago. Last February, Mr. Obama said that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms. On Iraq, he said in the primaries that we need to be ''as careful getting out as we were careless getting in.''
 Has Mr. Obama really changed his positions, or have we not been listening to the positions that he had all along?
 Jeremy Wortman Chicago, July 8, 2008
 To the Editor:
 It's alarmingly that large blocs of Democratic voters (and much of the media) are so dissatisfied with President Bush and so excited about the historical aspect of Barack Obama's candidacy that they are ignoring or excusing the senator's abandonment of his earlier positions.
 Few supporters seem to care that Mr. Obama is guilty of the very charge his supporters made against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton: that she would say or do anything to get elected. 
 Mr. Obama's malleable principles can be seen in his dealings with Antoin Rezko, a fund-raiser who was found guilty of fraud and bribery; his relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr.; and his changing political views.
 He is not the reformer we desperately need in the White House.
 Buck Rutledge Knoxville, Tenn., July 9, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Oh shock and dismay!
 Could anyone have imagined that voters and the media could be taken in by a first-term senator with a skimpy voting record who speaks only in golden generalities.
 Shocking indeed!
 Joseph Boggs Ridgefield, Conn., July 8, 2008
 To the Editor:
 My gratitude to Gail Collins for ''The Audacity of Listening'' (column, July 10). She points out that those people who are wringing their hands about Barack Obama's ''flip-flops'' haven't been paying attention. 
 Most of what people are calling flip-flops are long-held positions of Mr. Obama that some voters chose not to pay attention to during the primaries. 
 Mr. Obama is working to change the process and practice of politics as we know it through a rejection of ideology in favor of common sense and by affirming the need for grass-roots change.
 He is building the narrative that will convince all Americans, once and for all, that we need universal health care, that we need to invest heavily in education, that we need to rebuild our economy in a way that addresses climate change. 
 Leadership requires compromise, and as long as Mr. Obama uses compromise as a means to reach an end and not as an end in itself, then I say, ''Yes, we can!''
 Liz Arnett El Cerrito, Calif., July 10, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The idea of a candidate who campaigns as a progressive moderate, willing to work across party lines, but is seen by both conservatives (negatively) and liberals (hopefully) as a pure liberal is not a new one.
 In fact, we have a recent example: Bill Clinton. 
 As it happens, Mr. Clinton's presidency could have been easily predicted by his campaign platform and positioning: appoint moderate judges, end welfare as we know it, try to reform health care, balance the budget and compromise for the sake of progress.
 The right wing always saw him as a dangerous liberal, and pilloried him for ''flip-flopping'' on issues when he moved to the middle. It is apparent that they are dusting off this strategy against Barack Obama.
 But Mr. Obama has proved to be particularly adept at rebutting such unfair characterizations.
 James E. Sailer Brooklyn, July 10, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Gail Collins provides a well-reasoned analysis of why Barack Obama's lurch toward the center makes political sense. Here's my analysis of why it doesn't:
 Republican strategy: Move to the right and energize the base.
 Democratic strategy: Move to the center and alienate the base.
 Result in 2000 and 2004: President George W. Bush.
 Likely result in 2008: President John McCain.

HEADLINE: Feeling No Pain

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
A pro basketball player named Micheal (yes, that's the way he spells it) Ray Richardson once famously said of the New York Knicks franchise: ''The ship be sinking.''
 When a reporter asked him how far it could sink, Richardson reportedly replied: ''Sky's the limit.''
 Something similar might be said about today's economy, although Phil Gramm, a remarkably out-of-touch former senator from Micheal Ray's home state of Texas, would beg to differ. You may have lost your job or the family home. Or maybe you're behind in your car payment or your health insurance premium. Perhaps you can't afford the gas to get to work. 
 Phil Gramm will have none of your complaints: Get over it! Stop whining and eat your gruel. This recession's all in your head. 
 No one (not even John McCain, who tended toward the rapturous when describing Mr. Gramm's economic bona fides) could mistake this sour-visaged investment banker for a populist. 
 ''We're the only nation in the world,'' Mr. Gramm once said, ''where all our poor people are fat.''
 During one of the many Republican assaults on Social Security, the issue of cutting back benefits for the elderly came up in the Senate. ''They are 80-year-olds,'' howled Mr. Gramm. ''Most people don't have the luxury of living to be 80 years old, so it's hard for me to feel sorry for them.''
 John McCain, whose Straight Talk Express ran out of gas long ago, tried to paper over the implications of Mr. Gramm's unseemly outburst this week about the very real suffering that has descended on millions of Americans. ''Phil Gramm does not speak for me,'' said Senator McCain. ''I speak for me.''
 But the truth is that Mr. Gramm, a close friend of Senator McCain's for many years, has had a very loud say in the economic policies of the McCain presidential campaign. And those policies are an extension of the G.O.P. orthodoxy that is threatening to sink the ship of state, even as the very wealthy are dancing mindlessly to the music of another Gilded Age.
 In the real world, somewhere outside of Phil Gramm's field of vision, increasing numbers of Americans are working two and three jobs to make ends meet; struggling families are worried sick in July about what it will cost to heat their homes in January; food costs and home foreclosures are soaring; the job market has tanked; and the stock markets are running with the bears.
 In that kind of atmosphere, it's beyond obscene to have to listen to some platinum-card-carrying fat cat tell us, in a tone dripping with condescension: ''You've heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession.''
 What does it say about John McCain's judgment that this guy was one of his top -- and possibly his pre-eminent -- economic adviser? What does it say about Mr. McCain's judgment that in 1996, he believed Phil Gramm was the best choice to be president?
 The biggest failing of both parties in this presidential campaign has been the unwillingness to be forthright with the public about the true extent of the crises facing the country. The federal government and ordinary Americans are up to their eyeballs in debt. Much of the financial sector is in deep trouble, with previously blue-chip companies wobbling along on legs as rubbery as a bad check.
 Perpetual war in Iraq and oil prices spiking toward the moon are adding to a sense of national paralysis. Where is the money to invest in ventures that will create good new jobs, that will chart new directions in energy self-sufficiency, that will revitalize the public schools, rebuild the nation's infrastructure, put New Orleans back on its feet?
 Where are the grand ideas, the ideas worthy of a great nation?
 Barack Obama got a lot of play with his clever response to the Phil Gramm madness. ''You know, America already has one Dr. Phil,'' said Mr. Obama. ''When it comes to the economy, we don't need another.''
 Cute. But woefully inadequate. The Democrats, timid as always, should be pounding the populist pavement from one coast to another, explaining how the reckless and deliberately inequitable policies of the past several years have gotten the U.S. into this terrible fix.
 We should be getting chapter and verse about how badly the war in Iraq is hurting us here at home. We should be seeing charts and graphs explaining how ordinary Americans, now the hardest-working people on the planet, have been cheated out of their share of the extraordinary productivity improvements they've racked up over the years.
 There should be a sense of urgency coming from the Democrats in this campaign, a clarion call compelling enough to rally the legions who have been treated unfairly and badly hurt in the nation's other undeclared war: the class war.
 Phil Gramm was a general in that conflict, and there was nothing cute about it.

HEADLINE: Deal Talk Turns Friendly, And Brewers' Shares Rise

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Shares of Anheuser-Busch and the Belgian brewer InBev climbed sharply on Friday as the two began friendly talks to create the world's largest brewer in a deal for about $50 billion.
 Anheuser, the maker of Budweiser and a stalwart of American pop culture, agreed to talk with its unwanted suitor after InBev raised its offer to $70 a share in cash, from $65 a share, people briefed on the matter said. The two companies are expected to hold negotiations over the weekend, and a deal could be announced as soon as Monday, these people said.
 On Friday, in a sign of InBev's confidence, the company began syndicating $45 billion in bank loans that it would need to finance a deal, according to a report by the Reuters Loan Pricing Corporation. 
 Shares of InBev opened higher on the Brussels Stock Exchange on Friday, closing up 7.4 percent at 44.50 euros. Shares of Anheuser rose 8.6 percent, to $66.50.
 The talks could bring a quick end to an increasingly hostile confrontation between the two brewers, one that began with InBev formally offering $46.3 billion last month. The American company quickly spurned the approach, deeming the price too low. 
 Though InBev consistently said it wanted to strike a friendly deal, it proved willing to go hostile. On Monday it began a campaign to unseat Anheuser's board. It even recruited an uncle of Anheuser's chief executive as a nominee for its rival slate of directors.
 The American company responded with a lawsuit in federal court, accusing InBev of lying about its financial commitments. Anheuser went so far as to argue that because of the Belgian brewer's Cuban operations, the combined company would run afoul of American trading prohibitions against the country.
 InBev's persistence was driven by twin desires to capitalize on a weak dollar and to overtake SABMiller of London as the world's largest brewer by sales volume. 
 Both SABMiller and InBev, themselves the products of mergers struck this decade, have embarked on a wave of consolidation to gain distribution channels around the world. 
 Anheuser, which controls about 50 percent of the United States beer market and owns big stakes in top Mexican and Chinese brewers, would be the new crown jewel in InBev's portfolio, which already includes Stella Artois, Bass and Beck's.
 If a deal is reached, it would be the end of the Busch family's 148 years of control of Anheuser. The only exception was the time from 2000 to 2006 that Patrick T. Stokes was chief executive; he is now the company's chairman.
 August A. Busch IV, Anheuser's current chief and a scion of the Busch family, faced increasing pressure to accept an InBev bid. The company's own cost-cutting efforts, including a promise to cut its work force by 15 percent, drew little support from analysts or investors. It began facing further pressure after several major shareholders, including Warren E. Buffett, were leaning toward supporting InBev's offer.
 W. Randolph Baker, Anheuser's chief financial officer, said in a statement that the company did not comment on rumors.
 Anheuser's about-face risks raising the hackles of Missouri politicians and customers who rallied to the brewer's side as it sought to fight off the unwanted advances. InBev sought to head off criticism by promising to keep the combined company's headquarters in St. Louis and to maintain ''the Anheuser-Busch heritage'' in the new entity's name.
 That did little to assuage Matthew R. Blunt, the governor of Missouri, who said he was ''strongly opposed'' to an InBev takeover of Anheuser. Last month, he requested a review of the offer by the Federal Trade Commission.
 ''I am concerned that this sale would have destabilizing impacts on our nation and state's long-term economic interests,'' Mr. Blunt wrote in a letter to the regulator. ''I am opposed to this buyout and am asking you to conduct this review as quickly as possible.'' 
 Anheuser's political support crossed party lines. Mr. Blunt and Christopher S. Bond, Missouri's Republican senator, were joined by two of the state's top Democrats: the state's other United States senator, Claire McCaskill, and Mayor Francis G. Slay of St. Louis. 
 Mr. Bond said, ''InBev buying Anheuser-Busch is as popular in St. Louis as $4 gas.'' 
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Blunt said he had no comment beyond his previous statements. Representatives for Ms. McCaskill and Mr. Slay did not return calls.

HEADLINE: Worst Fears Ease, for Now, On Mortgage Giants' Fate

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A day that began with a stomach-churning drop in stock prices for the two largest mortgage finance companies ended with a measure of relief, after government officials and lawmakers managed to calm investors worried about the health of the two companies. 
 Bush administration officials had worked into the early morning hours on Friday drawing up contingency plans to rescue the companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, should their financial plight worsen. And when both companies' stocks fell 50 percent initially, some investors feared the worst. 
 But by the end of the day, the shares rebounded after both were able to easily continue the regular borrowing of money they need to finance their day-to-day operations and keep the nation's mortgage machinery humming. 
 If Fannie and Freddie had been cut off from borrowing by other financial institutions, the government might have been forced to step in and support them. 
 Still, the modest relief on Friday was tempered by concerns over what might unfold in coming weeks, should the housing market's woes continue and further weaken the finances of Fannie and Freddie. 
 Uncertainty about the financial stability of the companies, which lie at the heart of the nation's housing market, underscored their size and complexity. 
 Both companies, which already have suffered $11 billion in losses in the last nine months, could report new quarterly losses in August if foreclosures continue.
 The financial markets continue to show signs of stress, underscored by the decline in the Dow Jones industrial average, which fell below 11,000 on Friday for the first time in two years before closing at 11,100.54, down 1.1 percent.
 Shares of Freddie Mac closed at $7.75, down more than 45 percent for the week. Fannie Mae settled at $10.25, a 30 percent slide for the week. And a fresh sign of industry problems emerged on Friday when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seized IndyMac Bank, making it the largest bank to fail since the 1990s. 
 The company, an offshoot of Countrywide Financial and once one of the nation's largest independent mortgage lenders, was a major issuer of subprime loans. 
 After meeting with his economic policy team on Friday morning, President Bush said that he had been briefed about the problems confronting Fannie and Freddie by the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr.
 ''Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are very important institutions,'' the president said. ''He assured me that he and Ben Bernanke will be working this issue very hard,'' referring the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 Earlier in the day, Mr. Paulson sought to calm investors concerned that the stock of Fannie and Freddie could be wiped out if the government took over one or both of the companies and placed them under the control of a conservator, as the law permits. The administration has prepared such a plan if the companies continue to decline, people briefed on the plan have said.
 ''Today our primary focus is supporting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in their current form as they carry out their important mission,'' Mr. Paulson said. Officials said Mr. Paulson wanted to convey the message that even under a conservatorship, the companies would not be nationalized. Instead, a conservator would have to prepare a plan to restore the company to financial health, much like a company in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
 Federal Reserve officials took pains to dismiss rumors swirling through the markets and in Washington that the central bank was considering a new program to lend money directly to the companies through its so-called discount window. The Fed began two such programs to lend money to the nation's largest investment banks last March. 
 ''Fed officials are following the situation closely,'' said Michelle A. Smith, the Fed's chief spokeswoman. ''We've had no discussions with the companies about the discount window. We don't discuss the range of options we are considering.''
 After a flurry of phone calls with administration and Fed officials, senior Democrats in Congress also said they were persuaded that the steep declines in the stock of the two companies did not reflect new underlying financial problems, and that the companies had the financial wherewithal to get through the turmoil. Their comments went far beyond the cautiously worded assurances by senior officials earlier in the week that had done little to calm the markets.
 ''There is a sort of a panic going on and that's not what ought to be,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who heads the Senate banking committee. ''The facts don't warrant that reaction, in my view.''
 Mr. Dodd said that he was persuaded by conversations with Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke that the two companies ''are fundamentally sound and strong.'' 
 He said that housing legislation the Senate approved on Friday evening, part of which would overhaul the regulation of Fannie and Freddie, could be completed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush by next week. The measure, sponsored by Mr. Dodd, must go back to the House to be reconciled with its version adopted in May. 
 Investors, left dizzy by the rapid-fire turns in Freddie and Fannie's shares, suffered through one of the most volatile days in the market since the Bear Stearns debacle in March. 
 The day began darkly with investors confronting figures that once seemed unthinkable: Freddie Mac's stock was down a whopping 50 percent, with Fannie Mae not far behind. As rumors of a government bailout made their way across trading desks, Mr. Paulson's statement -- suggesting that no government takeover of Fannie and Freddie was imminent -- seemed to only increase the uncertainty.
 ''Paulson jumped in earlier today and tried to be reassuring, but in many ways it backfired,'' Edward Yardeni, an investment strategist, said. ''He really didn't say anything that he hadn't before.''
 But some investors saw the depressed shares as a buying opportunity. At the close, Freddie finished down just 3 percent, a relief to investors who had feared the worst. Fannie, however, sold off 22 percent of its value.
 As they watched the markets, senior officials at the Treasury and the Federal Reserve were described on Friday as being less fixated on the stock prices of Fannie and Freddie and more interested in the companies' ability to raise money to continue to fund their daily operations and buy new mortgages from banks and other lenders. 
 The two companies already own or guarantee more than $5 trillion in mortgages. They need to borrow money constantly so they can buy mortgages from lenders, repackage them as securities and sell them to investors. 
 Fannie and Freddie hold some of the mortgages they buy in their own investment portfolios; the rest are sold to pension funds, mutual funds and other investors, with Fannie and Freddie guaranteeing each mortgage against default by the homeowner. Officials noted that the companies' ability to raise money had improved in recent months, including on Friday, allowing the companies to borrow at rates close to those of the United States Treasury.
 One interpretation of this is that the debt markets believe that the federal government will take steps to bail out the companies should they become insolvent. Moreover, the insurance premiums that are paid by the buyers of the debt securities issued by the companies declined significantly on Friday, a sign that the markets do not believe the companies are on the brink of failure.
 ''In these volatile markets, share price is not the most reliable measure for judging Fannie and Freddie and will not dictate the responses by the regulators,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who has held discussions all week with senior administration officials. ''Rather, the regulators are closely watching the performance of the companies' bonds, and how their yields compare to U.S. Treasuries. Right now, Freddie and Fannie bonds are trading closer to Treasuries than they were in March after the Bear Stearns collapse, a reassuring signal.''
 It was a crushing liquidity problem -- as lenders called in existing loans and refused to lend any more -- that ultimately prompted the government to rescue Bear Stearns last March from possible bankruptcy.
 Normally, when a company's stock price plunges to dangerously low levels, the company also has significant problems raising money in the debt markets because borrowers fear that they may not be repaid. But in a perverse cycle, the news this week that the government was considering putting them into a conservatorship has had the effect of making the debt of those companies more attractive. 
 Fannie Mae, founded in 1938, was originally called the Federal National Mortgage Association, but adopted its nickname as a formal title in the 1990s. Its younger and smaller sibling, Freddie Mac, was begun in 1970.

HEADLINE: Negotiating the Contrasts of Poverty and Wealth

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

 BODY:
A presidential campaign is as ungainly a marriage of the achingly real and the unrelentingly material as one can find in American life.
 Senator Barack Obama listens to a mother who lost a son in Iraq, and a father who cannot afford health insurance. Then he tightens his tie knot and sets off to elegant fund-raisers.
 The eternal verity of presidential politics is that candidates can talk all they like about the impoverished and the struggling, but everyone must put in long hours scrounging up money from the terrifically wealthy. Mr. Obama puts the dissonance into words in his book ''The Audacity of Hope'' (Crown Publishing, 2006). 
 ''I know that as a consequence of my fund-raising I became more like the wealthy donors I met,'' he wrote, ''in the very particular sense that I spent more and more of my time above the fray, outside the world of immediate hunger, disappointment, fear, irrationality and frequent hardship of the other 99 percent of the population.'' 
 Some days, those worlds nearly collide.
 Policy, Up Close
 Early Tuesday, in Powder Springs, Ga., policy takes flesh before the candidate's eyes.
 Jeana Brown raises her arm in a forest of outstretched hands in the bleachers at the high school and Mr. Obama points to her -- ''Me?!'' ''Yes, you'' -- and voice quaking, Ms. Brown says:
 ''I am one of your small contributors -- $5 actually,'' she says.
 She wants to tell Mr. Obama, who is talking about the 30 percent increase in the number of Americans who have filed for bankruptcy, about her trailer. 
 She is 50 and her husband, James, is 48, and they worked and snipped coupons and saved for five years to afford their double-wide trailer. Their credit report had the usual nicks and dents, and so they took a 9.25 percent interest rate on their loan. They relied on their broker's promise ''that if we were good and made our payments, we could refinance at a better rate after a year.''
 A year later, Ms. Brown walked back in. The broker told her that because their trailer did not have a concrete foundation -- which costs thousands more dollars than they had -- she and her husband could not refinance.
 A job disappeared and they faced foreclosure. The couple doubled up on interest payments, from $670 to $1,378 per month. They cut off Internet and cable service and held three yard sales -- everything must go!
 They saved their home. 
 Now her husband drives a truck six weeks at a stretch and she works two jobs. Ms. Brown's chest heaves, her voice a quivering reed. 
 ''I tell you, I'm not sure how we keep doing this,'' she says. 
 Obama shakes his head. The gymnasium had gone silent. 
 ''Look,'' he says, ''Jeana is an example of America. Someone who is working hard, who saved, doing all the right things and then gets put into a financial bind primarily because people took advantage of her situation.''
 Afterward, Ms. Brown watches him work the rope line. She has brown hair and piercing eyes and hails from coal country; she is proud to describe herself as a white ''redneck.'' 
 Her husband, James, is black. When she heard Mr. Obama's speech on race in Philadelphia, she wrote her check. ''I researched him; he's real,'' she says. ''I haven't voted in 32 years but he's got mine.''
 She touches a reporter's arm; she's got a question.
 ''Do you think we'll be able to save our trailer?'' 
 Fine Wining and Dining
 Seven hours later, Mr. Obama sits in a leather-lined black S.U.V., riding the ''Brother Can You Spare $28,500'' finance circuit that has become a fixture of his campaign in recent weeks.
 His evening begins at The Rocks, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV's chateau away from chateau, this one all but ensconced in Rock Creek Park in Washington.
 The car turns up a curling driveway. There are oak and chestnut trees and a wayward doe, and then a three-story Southern-plantation-style manor, with towering columns and 17 windows across and a slate roof, looms into view. It is a useful reminder that before Gates and Bloomberg, Buffett and Geffen, there was old man John D. Rockefeller, who bequeathed to his descendants a truly astonishing mother lode of money.
 The scribes who follow Mr. Obama sit in an air-conditioned van while guests sip drinks. Then a staff member leads them to an anteroom, graced by ''Reclining Bather'' by Pablo Picasso.
 Waiters serve a summer-tropics crab salad, and a tell-tale tinkling of glass signals that the reporters might wander in. Mr. Rockefeller and his wife, Sharon, extol their candidate as one might a cherished and vintage Bordeaux; he is ''profoundly intelligent,'' yet a man of action. 
 Mr. Obama rises beneath a crystal chandelier and says he hopes to compete in 50 states. (He quotes that ''noted political strategist'' Woody Allen, who says ''90 percent of life is showing up.'') He asks these elegantly heeled men and women to put financial shoulders to the wheel of history.
 The reporters slip out afterward, leaving donors to their fillets of beef with mustard-cognac sauce and potato nests, washed down with sundry American and French wines.
 Viewed From a Distance
 Next stop is a hotel off Connecticut Avenue, where 550 geeks and investors shower techno-dollars on Mr. Obama. He references not tax codes, but the struggling working class. Some set down designer beers and applaud.
 The Obama fund-raiser rules are akin to a nonpetting zoo: Reporters may stare but no touching or talking is allowed, including to the candidate. Fortunately, Mr. Obama provided a social X-ray of this circuit in his book, and he did not neglect to scan himself.
 ''As a rule, they are smart, interesting people, knowledgeable about public policy, liberal in their politics,'' he writes of these crowds. But ''they found it hard to imagine there might be a social ill that could not be cured by a high SAT score.''
 The danger, he adds, is that such nights leave candidates at a remove from their days, not least Ms. Brown and her trailer.
 ''The problems of ordinary people, the Rust Belt town or the dwindling heartland, become a distant echo,'' he writes, ''abstractions to be managed rather than battles to be fought.''

HEADLINE: G.E. Profit Dips, but Meets Expectations

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
 General Electric reported a slight decline in second-quarter earnings Friday but managed to deliver results that were in line with Wall Street expectations, reassuring investors who feared a repeat of the profit shortfall that sent the giant conglomerate's stock tumbling in April.
 This time around, shares rallied slightly after Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, reaffirmed his company's earnings guidance for the balance of 2008 and noted that strong international growth continued to offset weakness in the United States. 
 ''We had a very strong quarter in a tough environment,'' Mr. Immelt told investors in a conference call. ''We're going to playing offense as a company.''
 ''When I go to places like India and China,'' he added, ''there's cranes everywhere and you just don't see the kind of slowdown driven by the U.S. consumer. The velocity doesn't seem to be slowing down.''
 G.E. earned $5.07 billion, or 51 cents a share, a 5.8 percent drop from the second quarter of 2007. Revenue, however, jumped 11 percent, to $46.89 billion.
 Mr. Immelt has been under pressure to turn G.E.'s sinking shares around. On Thursday, the company announced that it was planning to spin off its entire consumer and industrial unit, whose products include the light bulbs that have been closely identified with G.E. since its founding more than a century ago.
 As has been increasingly the case in recent years, G.E.'s crown jewel in the second quarter was its infrastructure division, which makes so-called big iron products like locomotives, jet engines and power turbines, and which has been riding a surge in demand from international markets.
 Infrastructure revenue jumped 26 percent, to $27.5 billion, while profits rose 24 percent, to $3.1 billion. Wall Street has been clamoring for the company to sell or spin off slower-growth businesses to bolster G.E.'s overall growth rate and showcase its strength in infrastructure. 
 Analysts reacted positively to the news, which was a rare bright spot in an otherwise bleak picture on Wall Street on Friday. With the Dow Jones industrials off more than 120 points, G.E. shares held steady and finished up 2 cents, at $27.66. 
 ''Given last quarter's earnings calamity, it was very reassuring that this quarter was very much on track,'' added Deane Dray, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. ''People came into this quarter with strong memories of the disappointment. But this earnings report came in as expected, which in itself was a relief.''
 Even though the company did make its numbers, there was plenty of evidence of the weakening American economy buried in the fine print.
 Profit at the consumer and industrial unit plunged 55 percent as buyers abruptly pulled back on purchases of appliances like washers and dryers. The sales drop was especially sharp in the new home segment, said Keith S. Sherin, the company's chief financial officer.
 ''Look at anything associated with housing and the consumer and we're directly impacted by it in the appliance business,'' he said. 
 With consumers in the United States and elsewhere feeling the pinch, profit at GE Money, the company's consumer and small-business finance arm, fell by 9 percent. In a separate announcement Friday, G.E. said it would sell its Japanese consumer finance operations to Shinsei Bank for more than $5 billion.
 Revenue at the NBC Universal unit, another spinoff candidate, rose 7 percent while profit eked out a 1 percent gain. With the Beijing Olympics to be carried by NBC later this summer, G.E. expects the Games to contribute $1 billion in advertising revenue.
 Although NBC Universal's earnings growth was tepid, Mr. Dray said that its 23.4 percent profit margin made it the most profitable of any of G.E.'s operating segments during the quarter. With lighting and appliances on the block, he said, ''expectations should be low for any more major divestitures including NBC Universal in the near term.''
 Profit at G.E. Commercial Finance, a prime culprit for the earlier earnings miss, rebounded and rose 7 percent.

 CORRECTION:
 A picture caption on Saturday with an article about General Electric's quarterly earnings may have left the incorrect impression that G.E. was selling appliances in Iran. While the picture, from The Associated Press, showed the company's products in a Tehran appliance store, General Electric said that the sales were unauthorized and that the company had stopped supplying the distributor who provided the appliances to the Tehran store.

HEADLINE: Friendly Campaigning, Only Not So Much

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senators Barack Obama and John McCain have pledged to wage respectful, dignified and honest presidential campaigns.
Yet there was Mr. Obama this week, sarcastically calling Mr. McCain's chief economic adviser, former Senator Phil Gramm, ''Dr. Phil'' -- a reference to the touchy-feely television psychologist Phil McGraw -- for saying that recent economic woes were based on a negative national mind-set.
''He's 'Dr. No,' '' Mr. McCain shot back, using his new pet name for Mr. Obama -- based on a villain in the 1962 James Bond movie -- because of his opposition to various proposals from Mr. McCain.
What's a little name-calling between transcendent political figures? 
Every presidential election year, the nominees of the major parties vow to run cordial campaigns only to behave otherwise when the battle finally joins.
This campaign, though, had held out more promise than most previous election cycles to be something different, with two candidates whose pledges to change ''politics as usual'' have been central to their political identities. Mr. Obama has regularly inveighed against ''all the petty bickering and point-scoring in Washington''; Mr. McCain, whose bus and plane are streaked with the words ''Straight Talk,'' has talked about running ''a respectful campaign,'' what he has called ''an argument among friends.''
But roughly a month into the general election campaign, the Obama and McCain campaigns are already locked in a minute-by-minute fight, trading advertisement for advertisement, sound bite for sound bite, press release for press release -- and, yes, insulting name for insulting name -- with rhetoric that can be as harsh and misleading as that of any previous campaign.
At play, beyond real policy differences over major issues like taxes and Iraq, is a fierce competition to win the moment in a hypercharged news environment driven not only by cable and the evening newscasts but also by the scores of Web sites that now cover politics by the minute with screaming headlines attached to the smallest developments.
The tone of the discourse seems to carry risks for two men who in part became their parties' presumptive nominees by speaking against partisan bickering, said Matthew Dowd, a former strategist for Mr. Bush.
''The reason why each of these candidates won was for the exact opposite reason from how they've been acting lately,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''They need to say to themselves, 'Listen, what made me special, what made it work for me, was this, and I'm going to have to have a disciplined approach that matches my rhetoric.' ''
For their part, the campaigns blame each other for setting a combative tone that makes turning down the volume the equivalent of unilateral disarmament.
Behind the scenes are amped-up campaign war rooms that between them send dozens of attack e-mail messages to reporters on a given day. The force behind some of the harder-charging rhetoric may be no different than what prompted allies of John Quincy Adams to run searing attack pamphlets against Andrew Jackson nearly 200 years ago: It works.
''As long as it continues to work,'' said Prof. William D. Harpine, the chairman of the department of communications at the University of South Carolina, Aiken, ''there will be some temptation by even the most high-minded candidates to engage in unfair, negative campaigning.''
The early talk of an unusually dignified campaign year had caused worry at places like FactCheck.org, a group devoted to highlighting false and misleading campaign statements under the auspices of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.
''If the dialogue becomes too elevated, I'll have to retire,'' said Brooks Jackson, the FactCheck.org director. ''So far, no danger there.''
The group has had a particularly busy couple of weeks, with Mr. McCain's campaign and the Republican Party providing much of the fodder recently.
There was the party-sponsored television advertisement and a McCain-sponsored Web video that said Mr. Obama was opposed to ''innovation'' on energy policy, the development of electric cars and nuclear power. (Mr. Obama has proposed a $150 billion investment in the accelerated development of alternative energy sources, including hybrid-electric car engines, and does not oppose nuclear energy.)
There was a McCain campaign claim that Mr. Obama voted 94 times ''for higher taxes'' (the tally includes nearly two dozen instances in which Mr. Obama simply did not go along with proposed cuts by Republicans), and a McCain and Republican Party radio advertisement that said Mr. Obama supported raising taxes on people who made as little as $32,000. The bill in question was a nonbinding budget resolution that did not propose raising taxes on anybody who made less than $41,500.
Mr. Obama's campaign began running a response radio ad on Friday citing the critique by FactCheck.org of that accusation, with one character equating the Republican claim with the tactics of President Bush's former strategist Karl Rove.
Mr. Obama and the Democratic Party have also taken their lumps for misstating Mr. McCain's positions. Mr. Obama said last month that Mr. McCain's campaign was ''fueled by contributions from Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs''; such donations accounted for a small percentage of Mr. McCain's campaign money, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
On Thursday, Mr. Obama said Mr. McCain believed the economy had made ''great progress.'' He was quoting from an interview Mr. McCain gave to Bloomberg Television last spring in which he referred to job creation under Mr. Bush but added that it was ''no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges.''
The Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee also sought this week to portray Mr. McCain as being against the Social Security system for saying ''it's an absolute disgrace'' that ''we are paying present-day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers.'' The Democratic Party held a news conference to criticize Mr. McCain's ''statement that Social Security is an 'absolute disgrace.' '' (Mr. McCain's aides said he was trying to describe projected shortfalls that could leave the system depleted when younger workers retire.)
Each side said it could support its accusations with facts and blamed its opponent for breaking vows to raise the level of discourse.
''It's clear that Senator McCain and his campaign treat straight talk like a slogan and not as a standard they adhere to,'' said Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Mr. Obama.
Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for Mr. McCain, said: ''Barack Obama has shown he's the type of politician who will advance himself before he advances the debate or the issues. Let's drop the pretense that he stands for a new type of politics.''
Mr. Bounds said Mr. McCain had nonetheless made ''a very serious and genuine effort to raise the debate,'' with his offer to hold a series of 10 town-hall-style debates before the conventions.

HEADLINE: A New Way to Play In Commodities

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
 INDIVIDUAL investors who have become blase trading gold and oil over their morning coffee have some new alternatives. They can even place bets on the future direction of the global coffee market.
 In late June, Barclays rolled out a series of exchange-traded notes, or E.T.N.'s, intended to reflect prices on a handful of individual commodities, including coffee, cocoa and sugar. The notes are part of a wave of new financial products that allow go-it-alone investors to bet on specific commodities. Food, it seems, is being treated as the new oil, with many of these products tracking grain and livestock prices.
 Financial advisers say they are hardly surprised by this trend, given the sharp recent climb in food prices, but they caution individual investors not to be swayed by the latest headlines. 
 ''Unless you think that we're going back to the 16th-century spice trade, you should not be speculating on individual commodities,'' said Gary Schatsky, a fee-only financial planner in New York. Mr. Schatsky said that when clients were particularly worried about inflation, he might recommend putting a few percent of their assets into gold. But if investors were more interested in commodities for diversification purposes, he preferred low-cost natural resources funds.
 ''Not being a farmer or a miner myself, I favor the stocks,'' rather than owning the actual commodities, Mr. Schatsky said. He noted that commodity prices tended to be more volatile than the shares of commodity producers. 
 Roy Weitz, founder of FundAlarm.com, a sardonic Web site that often criticizes the investment industry, called the new single-commodity E.T.N.'s a ''distraction'' for most individual investors. ''There probably aren't more than a handful of people in the world who should be trading cocoa,'' he said.
 The first exchange-traded fund, or E.T.F., to focus exclusively on agricultural commodities began trading a year and a half ago, according to Morningstar. Since then, more than $2.5 billion has poured into this fund, the PowerShares DB Agriculture E.T.F., which puts equal emphasis on the prices of four crops: corn, wheat, soybeans and sugar.
 Some analysts have questioned why the fund needs to be so narrow. But Kevin Rich, the managing director at Deutsche Bank in charge of its commodity and currency E.T.F.'s, including this one, said the fund invested in those four commodities because they were among the most widely traded crops.
 ''Whereas in the world of equities, there's thousands of stocks you can buy, in commodities there's really only 30 you can buy, and only 10 or 15 of those have a lot of liquidity,'' Mr. Rich said. The fund's success has led to the creation of many E.T.N.'s with similar functions. 
 E.T.F.'s and E.T.N.'s both trade on exchanges but are structured differently. An exchange-traded fund is in some ways like a traditional mutual fund, but it trades throughout the day. With commodity E.T.F.'s, for example, shareholders own the underlying commodity futures.
 But an E.T.N. is a note issued by a financial company that promises, upon the note's maturity, to make a payment based on the gain or the loss in an index or a commodity, minus management fees. It is essentially unsecured debt, although the financial company does not pay interest or dividends, or guarantee the principal of the note, Paul Justice, a Morningstar analyst, said. 
 E.T.N.'s have some tax advantages, as long as investors hold them for more than a year, he added. In that case, any profits made from selling the shares would be taxed as long-term capital gains. But if an investor held an E.T.F. for more than a year, only 60 percent would be taxed as long-term gains, and the other 40 percent would be taxed at the short-term capital gains rate.
 In April, Deutsche Bank started trading four new exchange-traded notes that are essentially variations on its agricultural E.T.F. The DB Agriculture Long E.T.N. reflects the price changes for the same four crops as the fund. The bank also created an E.T.N. that doubles the returns of this note, and two others that are the inverse of the long and double-long notes.
 Mr. Rich of Deutsche Bank said that these investment products were all created in response to feedback from its clients, particularly financial advisers who work with individual investors or small institutional investors. ''These are building blocks for advisers to create their own diversified commodities portfolios,'' he said, adding that the short and double-short notes were created for clients who thought food supplies might eventually catch up with demand.
 NONE of the Deutsche Bank products are as narrowly focused as the new notes from Barclays. Besides the three notes tracking coffee, cocoa and sugar, Barclays also announced an E.T.N. last month that will track cotton prices. On the same day, it announced several new notes for individual metals -- like aluminum, platinum, lead and tin -- as well as one to track the nascent carbon trading markets.
 Representatives of two subsidiaries, Barclays Global Investors, which manages the E.T.N.'s, and Barclays Capital, which markets them, declined requests for interviews about the new products.
 Analysts say the Barclays E.T.N.'s may be the first to track individual crops, but they join a growing number of trading instruments focused on agricultural commodities. 
 For example, Barclays created a note last fall based on price movements in the cattle and hog markets. Nearly $180 million has flowed into this E.T.N. since it started trading in October, according to Morningstar.
 Michael Herbst, the lead natural-resources fund analyst at Morningstar, cautioned investors to examine the exposure that they might already have to agriculture in their managed stock mutual funds before considering buying any of the new E.T.N.'s. 
 He also said that the bullish outlook for agricultural products of all kinds was not a new investment idea, and that the markets might be vulnerable to a correction. ''A lot of this enthusiasm is based on demand growth from Asia, and the idea that they will be eating more protein,'' he said. ''But that doesn't mean that these are great investments anymore.''

THE EAVES OF HEAVEN 
 A Life in Three Wars. 
 By Andrew X. Pham. 
 301 pp. Harmony Books. $24.95. 
 Do we really need yet another Vietnam memoir? Yes, as it turns out. True, every second American who debarked in Saigon has written about the experience, but there are far fewer accounts of the war by Vietnamese in English, and much of what exists, on both the northern and southern sides, is marred by propaganda. Few books have combined the historical scope and the literary skill to give the foreign reader a sense of events from a Vietnamese perspective. Le Ly Hayslip's ''When Heaven and Earth Changed Places'' gave us the war through the eyes of a South Vietnamese peasant girl turned sex worker, while Nguyen Qui Duc's ''Where the Ashes Are'' told us what it was like to watch his father, a high-ranking official in Hue, be taken captive by the Vietcong. Bao Ninh's autobiographical novel ''The Sorrow of War'' gave us the viewpoint of a disillusioned North Vietnamese grunt. And now we can add Andrew Pham's ''Eaves of Heaven'' to this list of indispensable books. 
 It is not exactly a memoir. Pham's earlier book, ''Catfish and Mandala'' (1999), told his own story, from his birth in Saigon in the early '70s through his family's journey as boat people to California, and on to his first return to Vietnam in the 1990s. ''The Eaves of Heaven'' is the story of Pham's father, which Pham tells, with a good deal of literary flourish, in his father's voice. This attempt at impersonation is risky: after all, writing about oneself is easy, but telling the truth about one's father is a far graver affair. And yet Pham pulls it off. 
 It helps that the story perfectly traces the arc of 20th-century Vietnamese history. Pham's father, Thong Van Pham, was born in the mid-1930s into a family of feudal landowners in the Red River delta, about 40 miles southeast of Hanoi. Thong's uncle was the lord of the estate and the magistrate of the district, his father a playboy younger brother who spent most of his time enjoying the pleasures of French colonial Hanoi. Thong grew up in the countryside, pitching rocks and staging pet-cricket fights with the village boys. Then history intruded. The Japanese seized French Indochina, and as the war turned against them they requisitioned so much rice that hundreds of thousands of peasants starved. After the Japanese were driven out in 1945, Ho Chi Minh's Communists declared Vietnam independent but were soon locked in a guerrilla war against returning French forces. Meanwhile, the Communists were busy assassinating members of the rival Nationalist Party and anyone deemed a French collaborator -- including Thong's uncle, whose post of magistrate made him a colonial official. 
 After his mother died giving birth to her fourth child, the family decamped for Hanoi, where they set up an inn that quickly degenerated into a profitable whorehouse for French soldiers, supporting Thong's father's growing opium habit. When the Communists defeated the French and took over North Vietnam in 1954, the family headed south to Saigon, where they opened a noodle shop that failed and slid into poverty. Thong did well in school, landed a teaching job and started a family, but was drafted in 1963 as the war geared up. He ended up as the leader of a Rural Development Task Force, running combined village-level military defense and economic development teams in concert with Usaid -- the same counterinsurgency tactics the United States is now attempting in Iraq. After a few terrifying combat episodes, his life settled into a period of uneasy peace, dominated by status competitions with his old high school friends, overshadowed by the sense that their corrupt, incompetent government would never hold out against the Communists without continued American military support. And then, after that support was withdrawn, came the crash.
 Andrew Pham tells his father's story in the fashionable hopscotch nonchronological exposition one finds these days in everything from TV's ''Lost'' to Denis Johnson's Vietnam novel of last year, ''Tree of Smoke.'' The strategy may at first be confusing, but it gathers force as it goes along. The cut-up narrative works in part because the scenes Thong Van Pham has given his son to work with are so vivid, authentic and strange: watching a sadistic Algerian legionnaire disembowel a hapless farmer in front of his village, discussing French novels with the girls who turn tricks at his father's Hanoi inn (and spying on them through peepholes), gossiping about politics in a friend's swank Saigon bachelor pad, waiting for death in a postwar re-education camp. (Prisoners called for execution leave their meager possessions behind in the communal cell. ''Those of us who remained dared not use their belongings for fear of inheriting the same bad luck. Next to the toilet, a pile of goods collected like bones.'') By contrast, the characterization of Andrew's mother feels generically sweet: it's as though the author has not granted himself permission to freely imagine the interior of his parents' relationship.
 It is often said that the Vietnamese conception of history is circular rather than linear: the same episodes recur over and over, with only the details altered. ''The Eaves of Heaven'' has a similar feel. Thong Van Pham is constantly fleeing and rebuilding in the midst of war, watching world after world vanish, from the feudal estate of his childhood to the Hanoi of the '50s to the Saigon of the '70s. He and his son have done us the extraordinary service of bringing a few pieces of those worlds back again.

HEADLINE: From a Swarm of Bees, Sustenance and Savings

BYLINE: By GERRI HIRSHEY. 
E-mail: conn@nytimes.com

DATELINE: STORRS 

 BODY:
 ON a dank, rainy summer day, the University of Connecticut's main campus is all but deserted, save for scattered bands of incoming freshman shouting out the UConn Huskies' chant as part of orientation. Drive two miles out Route 195, and all is still on a dirt road that borders a lovely field belonging to the school's department of plant sciences. A pair of visitors approaching warily can detect a low and steady hum from a clearing ahead. 
 ''We won't get too close. Rainy days make them a bit cranky,'' warned Dennis Pierce, the director of dining services for the university. Ten newly populated beehives, painted gaudily with designs both primitive and sophisticated, stand like a live, vibrating art installation. Domesticated Italian honeybees, shipped from a breeder in Georgia in early June, shoot out of the hives and off toward an abandoned orchard. 
 This new apiary is part of an ambitious sustainability project to supply fresh locally grown food to campus dining services. As the largest consumer of local produce in the state, UConn also buys milk from local farmers and raises chickens on campus. Students grow vegetables in campus gardens, go trayless in dining halls and can even opt for one dining hall with a completely sustainable kitchen.
 ''We serve 130,000 meals a week when school is in session,'' Mr. Pierce said. ''We use about 3,800 pounds of honey a year, in tea, in sauces and baked goods. Within a year, we hope to get about 2,000 pounds from these hives.''
 The initial outlay was about $4,000 for apiary supplies, including hives, veils and suits, smokers and bees. Mr. Pierce, who crunched more modest food service numbers at Dartmouth before he came to UConn, likes the math. 
 ''Honey has been selling for about $5 a pound, though one of my managers tells me she's now seeing it as high as $8.'' At those prices, the 2,000 pounds produced here could mean a future savings of between $10,000 to $16,000 yearly. ''We're doing projections that see a 6 to 9 percent increase in food costs on the way, which is no news to anyone who's been to a supermarket lately,'' Mr. Pierce said. ''Every savings helps.''
 Economizing was only one objective in the beekeeping proposal submitted by two of Mr. Pierce's food service employees -- Amy Gronus, a production chef and backyard beekeeper, and Steven Anthony, a dining services assistant manager. The two are now also the university's beekeepers. ''Their pitch hit all the right areas,'' Mr. Pierce said. ''The return on investment is great, but they also outlined ideas for having the ag department do research involving the bees, and they got the community involved.''
 The wooden hives were delivered to local schools and organizations for decoration with a simple directive: Let your fancy fly as free and wild as the legendary twist-and-buzz ''honey dance'' of bees that communicates pollen locations. And use latex paint, please. The Mansfield Senior Center came up with a melange of flowers in soft pastels. From E. O. Smith High School, there was a punky comic book theme with the painted imperative, ''Buzz Off.''
 The bees will be giving back to the community as well, with all the pollinating power 100,000 colony members can muster. ''This is cool stuff,'' Mr. Pierce said. ''For us, it's the right thing to do.''
 For Mr. Anthony, reached by phone, it was also a great father-and-son project suggested by his 14-year-old son, Zack, and heartily abetted by Ms. Gronus. ''Amy has two hives at her home and knows how to handle bees,'' Mr. Anthony said. ''Zack and I took an extension service beekeeping class and joined the local beekeepers' association. We've been reading a lot. And we put the hives together, along with 500 trays that hold the honeycomb.'' 
 Mr. Anthony said their confidence was most tested once those 100,000 bees arrived. ''I've never really had a fear of them. But up until a month before they arrived, I'd never picked up a frame full of bees. It was a little daunting.'' Zack, he said, ''is very comfortable with the bees, and doesn't even wear gloves to handle them.''
 If all goes well, there will be a honey harvest in the fall -- just in time for peak demand. ''College students are emotional eaters,'' Mr. Pierce said as he pointed out an old barn that will house a honey extractor at harvest time. ''You'll find a wave of vegetarian demand just before bathing suit season. All year round, but especially in winter, they always look toward comfort foods, whether it's from academic stress, homesickness or a romantic breakup.'' 
 And when the northeasters blow across central Connecticut and midterms chill the soul, what better comfort than a steaming cup of herbal tea--spiked with sweet, sustainable Husky honey?

HEADLINE: Drowning In Riches

BYLINE: By KENNETH M. POLLACK. 
Kenneth M. Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Saban Center for Middle East Policy, is the author of the forthcoming book ''A Path Out of the Desert: A Grand Strategy for America in the Middle East.''

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 YOU might think that $140 per barrel oil would be good for at least one part of the world, the Middle East. It's too soon to tell for certain, but the region may well turn out to be the part of the world that suffers the most. 
 As painful as the current (or coming) oil-driven recession will be for Americans, it does seem to be convincing us to make the sacrifices necessary to diminish our reliance on oil. Over the long term, that could prove a huge boon for our economy, our environment and our national security.
 In the Middle East, the situation may be reversed. Right now, the region is experiencing an economic boom, creating the opportunity to address the deep-seated political, economic and social problems that have spawned terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. That's certainly what the people of the region hope.
 The danger is that the way that the rising revenues are being spent will more likely worsen the region's instability over time. 
 And that's a problem, because problems in the Middle East have a bad habit of becoming big problems for the rest of the world. The Middle East isn't Las Vegas: what happens there doesn't stay there.
 In the 1970s and '80s, during the first great oil boom, the Middle Eastern producers largely squandered their wealth. Some did set up vast social-welfare networks that improved health care (an important reason for the explosive population growth of the past 30 years). But by and large they sent the money overseas, putting it in foreign real estate and Swiss bank accounts. This did nothing to develop (let alone diversify) their economies, and so when the boom turned to bust in the 1990s, economic problems mushroomed. With them came political discontent, terrorism and rebellion. 
 This time around, some Middle Eastern oil producers are trying to be smarter. They are investing billions of dollars at home, building industries, repairing roads and factories, and expanding social services. This has led regional elites and many in the international financial community to proclaim a new era in the Middle East -- one in which the new oil revenues will diversify the region's economies, create jobs for everyone, and make the Arab states the world's economic superpower.
 If this sounds unlikely, it's because it almost certainly is. More oil money is being re-invested in the region, but it is not being spent where it is most needed. As a result, it is having little impact on what really matters, and is even creating problems. 
 The macroeconomics often do look great: gross domestic product, trade and foreign direct investment are all rising substantially. But unemployment and underemployment have declined very little and inflation is rising quickly. At a microeconomic level, critical problems belie the rosy picture painted by the superficial macro indicators. 
 In addition, much of the money is being re-invested in projects intended to produce quick profits for investors rather than long-term political and economic gains. A great deal of it is going into non-productive sectors like real estate and oil refining. Many of the factories being built with the new oil revenues will be heavily automated plants that will employ few people. 
 The industries that create lots of new jobs, like tourism, agriculture and construction, import workers from southern and southeastern Asia rather than hire locals. Similarly, the oil revenues are being used to expand educational systems but, with a few exceptions, not to reform them. Consequently, more students are being educated -- and their expectations of a better life whetted -- only to find out that they lack the skills to get the jobs they believe their schooling entitles them to. Across the region, youth unemployment averages at least 25 percent, close to double the global average.
 Both the rise in energy prices and the flood of oil revenues have stoked inflation. Qatar's current rate is 14 percent, up from 2.6 percent in the 2002-2004 period. As always, inflation hits the middle and lower classes hardest, and in many Arab states it is destroying the middle class, driving its members to the levels of the poor. That is pushing many into the arms of Islamist extremists seeking to overthrow the regimes.
 The rise in global food prices has also hit the Middle East hard. Bread riots have convulsed Egypt and Yemen (not major oil producers, but two of the Arab world's most populous states and cogs in the regional economy). In Saudi Arabia, fear of riots led the government to threaten to detain or confiscate the businesses of bakers and store owners who sell flour above the government-set subsidized price. 
 To combat the effects of inflation, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates have raised government salaries by 15 percent to 70 percent. In the short run this could help civil servants, but it also further increases inflation and does nothing to deal with the structural economic problems.
 The foreign workers whom Arab states increasingly rely on because they tend to be cheaper and more productive than their own citizens are also beginning to show signs of unhappiness with their shoddy treatment. Foreign workers, who make up 80 percent to 95 percent of the private sector work forces in the small Persian Gulf states, have gone on strike in recent months in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to protest inflation, which is eroding their earnings. With foreigners making up roughly 40 percent of the population of the Arabian Peninsula, such labor unrest is ominous.
 Meanwhile, the region's rich have grown obscenely more wealthy through their ability to tap into the windfall oil profits, both legally and illegally. The wealthiest measure their wealth in the billions, while the poorest are so poor that growing numbers cannot even afford to marry.
 Money pouring in but not trickling down tends to create a dangerous social imbalance. People hope their country's oil windfall will alleviate their own economic problems only to find that vast sums are being siphoned off into graft; redirected out of the country to private accounts; spent on luxury items, military hardware or ''white elephant'' projects; or simply wasted.
 It is worth keeping in mind the worst case from the history of the first Middle Eastern oil boom. Under Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Iran tried to use the influx of oil revenues after the 1973 oil-price increases to build new industries, eradicate unemployment, transform the economy and modernize society.
 On paper, the shah's efforts seemed superbly enlightened. As in the Arab states today, the macro indicators of Iranian progress -- per capita gross domestic product, education expansion, foreign investment -- seemed phenomenal. But the projects were mismanaged and riddled with graft. The royal cronies became fabulously wealthy while the plight of the average Iranian worsened because of protracted unemployment coupled with soaring inflation. Rather than solving Iran's problems, the oil boom sparked the Iranian revolution.
 A few in the region seem to be heeding that lesson. King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia continues to demonstrate a keen grasp of what is in his country's best long-term interests. He has poured money into economic cities that serve as ''centers of excellence'' to attract the kind of meaningful investment that, over time, could lift the Saudi labor force out of its dangerous doldrums. He is establishing the King Abdullah University, bringing in professors from all over the world to develop a curriculum emphasizing science, technology and innovation. But even here there is a dark lining: Abdullah is 83, and it is doubtful that his successors would continue such projects with the same progressive determination.
 How can the region turn things around? For starters, those charged with managing its sovereign wealth funds and private investments need to shift from bankrolling capital-intensive industries that guarantee a high return for the investor to financing labor-intensive industries that could increase employment and develop a more capable work force. 
 At some level, this means thinking of regional investment as a form of deliberate wealth redistribution, social engineering and charity. It will certainly cut into the bottom lines during the short term, but if those who hold the purse strings are wise enough to do it, it should yield priceless political rewards in the years ahead -- political rewards that are probably going to be necessary if they are to avoid being swept out of power by angry mobs. 
 Avoiding those kind of internal upheavals and eliminating much of the anger and despair upon which the terrorists and extremists prey would be a major boon to a world that is likely to remain addicted to Middle Eastern oil, and therefore vulnerable to its vicissitudes, for decades to come.

HEADLINE: Where's the Talk About Racial Justice?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Affirmative Distraction,'' by Stephen L. Carter (Op-Ed, July 6):
 The topic of racism is difficult to engage on a national level, especially for those of us who find ourselves in the privileged end of the matrix. But by ignoring and suppressing the existence of racial injustice, we are disempowering whole communities. 
 This year I had the pleasure of working at a great high school in the South Bronx. Most of the students were black and poor, and very aware of their oppression. 
 In ''Dreams From My Father,'' Barack Obama presented a clearsighted and pragmatic look at the effects of this country's history of institutional racism. Unfortunately, an honest conversation about this has been sorely absent from his campaign. 
 If there's any hope for entrenched racism to be undone, we need politicians brave enough to bring this topic back into our public consciousness.
 Aliyah Vinikoor New York, July 6, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Stephen L. Carter makes a persuasive argument that affirmative action is merely a distraction from the real racial conundrum afflicting impoverished blacks. 
 While affirmative action has toppled historical barriers that restricted minorities from higher education and lucrative professions, a disturbingly large number of blacks and Latinos remain in a state of perpetual exile: to ghettos and barrios, and from college campuses. 
 Nowhere near a majority of minority members profit from racial or ethnic preferences. Indeed, seldom do the most vulnerable of these groups finish high school, let alone enjoy any advantage in college admissions courtesy of affirmative action. 
 The ingrained socioeconomic forces that propel these dismal dynamics in minority communities still haven't been widely addressed or even acknowledged by mainstream America.
 We need a deeper national discussion and understanding about race, culture and poverty, along with a concerted and committed effort to relieve the overarching circumstances that sentence many minority members to jail, poverty or death.
 Wayne Trujillo Denver, July 6, 2008
 To the Editor:
 To Stephen L. Carter's thoughtful argument should be added a discussion of white privilege. American professionals repeatedly mention the plight of the person of color, but ignore the flip side, which is the continued success of those who identify as white. 
 And, honestly, America cannot have oppression of people of color unless someone else is doing the oppressing. 
 Mr. Carter bemoans how politics avoids addressing ''the plight of those for whom race and poverty have become inexorably intertwined,'' but he doesn't discuss how race (white) and wealth are also tightly linked. 
 For this country to make racial justice its centerpiece, it must face white privilege.
 Anna Shabsin St. Louis, July 6, 2008
 To the Editor:
 With an African-American as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Stephen L. Carter's call for racial justice to become, once again, a centerpiece of American politics will not get traction. 
 But a call for economic justice will. 
 As a nation, we need to help economically disadvantaged people of all colors and avoid giving special privileges to economically successfully people of any color. 
 Let's take race out of affirmative action, make it color blind and help those who need it.
 Stephen J. Gordon San Diego, July 7, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Stephen L. Carter's critique of the bipartisan failure to address racial inequality unfortunately plays to the ranks of the so-called post-racial advocates who hope to eliminate public discourse on race altogether.
 Opponents of affirmative action have not used their victories to broaden opportunities for the very students Mr. Carter champions, but have instead attacked the remaining programs designed to improve educational access for those locked out. 
 Their attacks on voluntary integration, magnet school programs and resource equalization efforts prove that the assault on affirmative action is simply a beachhead in the larger war to remove racial equity concerns from polite policy debates altogether. 
 It's not because of the Bakke decision that Americans have turned a blind eye to the lack of opportunity for the black and brown poor. Bakke, while flawed, prevented a wholesale rollback of America's commitment to racial equality. 
 Mr. Carter is right to call for a renewal of that commitment, but shortsighted in believing that sacrificing affirmative action on the altar of colorblindness is the way to do so.
 Kimberle Crenshaw Madrid, July 8, 2008
 The writer, a professor of law at U.C.L.A. and Columbia Law School, is the executive director of the African American Policy Forum.
 To the Editor:
 Stephen L. Carter writes about affirmative action as if the only people who benefit from it are minority groups. But a diverse student population helps to broaden the worldview of everyone involved.
 Many high school students enter college with a very limited perspective, especially if they come from a school that lacks a diverse student population. 
 By seeking students of various cultural backgrounds, institutions of higher learning realize that the interaction created will allow the possibility of hearing different perspectives based on sometimes very different experiences, thereby broadening the minds of all.
 Tony Korec Medford, N.Y., July 6, 2008
 The writer is a senior lecturer in religious studies at St. Joseph's College.
 To the Editor:
 Stephen L. Carter writes that the Democratic Party opposes giving ''poor families in the inner cities the money they need to purchase private education for their children.'' 
 But school voucher programs don't offer the full cost of tuition at a private school, and therefore these programs are essentially useless to the neediest (often minority) families, and amount to a subsidy for middle-class (usually white) families.
 Mr. Carter presents his position as if it were a new, nonpartisan attempt to bridge the divide over race, when in fact it is just one more attempt to foist religious education subsidies on the taxpayer.
 Daniel Brezenoff Long Beach, Calif., July 6, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Stephen L. Carter writes that schools in the Northeast are segregated because affluent parents there are likely to move to the suburbs or enroll their children in private schools. 
 Mr. Carter advocates, as a remedy, giving poor families the money they need to purchase private education for their children, but notes that the Democratic Party opposes this.
 Democrats oppose this because they stand for public financing of public schools. If these schools were improved, minority and poor children would have a chance. Does Mr. Carter believe, for example, that because Social Security has problems, the only solution is to privatize it? 
 Let's invest tax revenue in public schools and make them places that all parents will want to send their children.

 A year after its introduction, the cheap rental bicycle system known as Velib' seems a signal success in Paris.

 TRADE DEAL THREATENED
 As President Bush sees the free-trade deal his administration negotiated with Colombia, it would open a new market for American produce and manufactured goods, not threaten American jobs and shore up a respected ally, President Alvaro Uribe.

 During the Vietnam War, Canada's Liberal prime minister welcomed American deserters and draft dodgers, declaring that Canada ''should be a refuge from militarism.''

 A proposal in the Spanish Parliament to grant limited rights to the great apes -- chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans -- juxtaposes two sets of sliding scales that are normally not allowed to slide against each other: how much kinship humans feel for which animals, and just which ''human rights'' each human deserves.

HEADLINE: Hey, Big Spender, Flying My Way?

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
BACK in Jack Kerouac's day, when people more often traveled along blacktop roads than through the jet stream, they hitched free rides by sticking out a thumb at a freeway onramp or hopping into a friend's old heap. Often enough the destination didn't matter to a hitcher embarked on a personal picaresque. What counted was the ride.
 Then air travel became cheap, Baby Boomers grew up, hitching turned into something scary (and illegal in places) and the romance of the highway waned. Fewer people were willing to risk turning up as a news brief with Hannibal Lecter's name in the headline. More had urgent reasons to reach their destinations on time. 
 But as one breed of hitchhiker vanished into folk legend, another kind has appeared. This new one isn't hauling a backpack with a well-thumbed copy of ''Siddhartha'' in its side pocket or wearing Levi's with holes in the knees. This new one isn't contentedly meandering in the general direction of Coachella or Burning Man. 
 With a pastel cashmere Loro Piano cardigan knotted casually around his or her neck, the new hitchhiker can be found in the lounges at places like Teterboro Airport in New Jersey or Aspen/Pitkin County Airport in Colorado. Tossing off the tail numbers that are the passwords for entry to airports serving private jet traffic, a person may be heard debating the merits of a Hawker versus a Challenger, extolling the seating capacity of Gulfstream jets and rating the onboard catering at a given airport, or fixed base of operation (F.B.O.).
 These people do not refer to themselves as hitchhikers, of course, any more than a gold digger admits to being on the make. The old aphorism that one does not marry for money, but rather mingles with the rich and marries for love has useful applications when it comes to cadging rides on private jets. 
 ''I don't think it's a calculated thing people do,'' said Marjorie Gubelmann Raein, the socialite and cash register heiress, who admits to having hopped the odd ride from New York to Palm Beach, Fla. ''There's a misconception that this is some hobby some people have of going around constantly on people's Gulfstreams.''
 In fact, Ms. Raein added, more often it is just a matter of friendly convenience. ''It's not like you're some moocher,'' she said. ''You're going somewhere and someone happens to have a plane.''
 Green that formulation is not, and yet it does possess a kind of poetry for its beneficiaries. Someone happens to have a plane. As it turns out, the likelihood of this being the case is less great than it was even a year ago, for reasons that must seem obvious. A slumping economy and spikes in fuel prices have each made serious inroads on the recent unprecedented boom in private aviation. 
 The news stories of billionaire high fliers impervious to economic downturns may be misplaced, aviation industry insiders say. Fuel consumption at private airports is markedly down. Hours spent aloft by private jets, either rented in full or through time-share programs, are ''exactly flat,'' said Dan Hubbard, a spokesman for the National Business Aviation Association. ''The economy is hitting everyone,'' he said. 
 Still, there are signs that those with their own jets won't be flying in cattle class anytime soon. ''The big trend is people upgrading to jumbo jets for private use,'' said Douglas D. Gollan, the editor of Elite Traveler, the glossy journal that bills itself as the ''private jet lifestyle magazine.''
 People who once cruised comfortably in a 12-seat Gulfstream G450, Mr. Gollan said, now gaze covetously at a Boeing Business Jet, a 737 reconfigured to accommodate not 150 commercial passengers but 18 to 25 private ones. ''In the land of high fliers,'' Mr. Gollan said, the talk is of jumbo McMansions in the sky. ''Airbus just signed six orders for private A350s,'' at a Swiss trade show, he said, referring to a $180-million jet that in its commercial application accommodates 300 passengers. 
 Who are the buyers of these behemoths? ''Russian oligarchs and Chinese billionaires and Indian steel moguls and Arab royalties,'' he said. ''But there are also plenty of American entrepreneurs who made their money making widgets, billionaires who pull out of the driveway and nobody knows who they are.'' Somebody knows them, though, because the planes those people own serve not just as business shuttles but as taxis for friends and acquaintances and also the family Labrador. For example, Leonard Tallerine, the independent oil and gas producer, and his wife, Janet, routinely extend their hospitality to pals on their frequent ''short hops'' between their houses in Houston, East Hampton and New Orleans. 
 ''Our attitude is, 'We're going, there's room, so come,' '' Mr. Tallerine said. 
 ON a recent Thursday morning, Diane Sustendal, a writer in New Orleans, got a call from Mr. Tallerine, who said he was flying to New York to meet with his investment bankers. He had space on his eight-seat Hawker 800 XP, a jet that is the aeronautic equivalent of a midsize sedan on the car rental lot. Did she need a lift? 
 By 10 a.m., Ms. Sustendal was ''drinking hot coffee and having warm muffins'' on Mr. Tallerine's jet, aboard which, she said, ''no one ever tells you to turn off your computer or your iPod.''
 By 3 p.m. she was in SoHo getting coiffed at Frederic Fekkai. By 7:30 the next morning, she was back on the plane with Mr. Tallerine, who made apologies for the cock's-crow departure.
 ''I thought we should try to be back in time for lunch at Galatoire's,'' he said, referring to the legendary restaurant.
 Generous and impulsive as Mr. Tallerine's gesture was, it was not unusual, say those who have developed a taste for ride sharing, a select group with a nose for what those in the industry call ''private jet families.''
 ''There are a lot of people in the social world who don't have the equipment to fly privately on their own,'' said David Patrick Columbia, who chronicles what used to be called the beau monde in his exhaustive New York Social Diary, whose Web site features a banner ad for a fractional jet share company. 
 ''And they do work it with some people,'' Mr. Columbia added, referring to beneficent types like a male Florida couple who own his and his eight-seat Bombardier Challengers, the four siblings from a wealthy Los Angeles clan who each owns a Gulfstream V, the billionaire financier who impulsively flies friends from his house in Hawaii to his other places in Aspen or New York on a retrofitted 737, or the former United States ambassador whose private Airbus some pals board as casually as it were the Amtrak Acela making a shuttle stop at Paris Charles de Gaulle.
 ''They're all looking for the ride, of course, but they're also looking for the quote unquote prestige,'' Mr. Columbia said, referring to the warm elation private jet hitchhikers profess to feeling at the thought of having joined the airborne elect. 
 In its outlines, hitchhiking on private jets is not entirely different from thumbing a ride by the side of a freeway.
 It is not, for a start, the kind of travel that suits people on rigid schedules (or for that matter, with round-trip discount commercial tickets, which, as Ms. Raein pointed out, become void if one flies just a single leg). It is not the sort of travel for people with who find it challenging to sing for their supper, and it is not an ideal means of transport with those lacking the Zen patience to cater to rich people's whims.
 ''How can you possibly thank somebody enough?'' said Steven Stolman, the designer who is organizing a 50-year retrospective of clothes by Lilly Pulitzer, the Palm Beach dressmaker. ''People who fly private all the time are always stuck with F.B.O. catering,'' said Mr. Stolman, who does most of his airborne hitchhiking along axes popular with the society ride-share crowd. 
 Referring to the typical private-jet fare of cold cut platters, fruit plates and defrosted shrimp cocktail, Mr. Stolman said the gift best appreciated by jet owners is often food. ''I stopped at a sports bar on the way to the plane once and bought 100 buffalo wings,'' he said. ''They appreciate things like that.'' 
 They also value guests who know the rules of the road, he added. But what are those?
 ''Never be late, because they won't hold the plane for you,'' Mr. Stolman said. ''Always ask the crew where you should sit, since the crew knows where the owner likes to be. Always sit in back until you are invited to move forward. Become an expert at determining how much personal space your host requires. If they want to read quietly, let them. But, believe me, I will perform Act II of a Broadway show if it's required.''
 Given the costs of flying -- the hundreds of thousands of dollars in fractional flight hours, the fuel surcharges and crew overtime, the equipment management fees and, in cases of full ownership, the $40 million or more required to buy a jet -- it makes sense that hosts might expect their guests to keep them entertained. 
 Mostly, though, hitchhikers attest that their hosts are ''happy to invite friends to share in that wonderful experience,'' said Dennis Basso, the high-end furrier, who flew to Paris in a friend's private aircraft not long ago. 
 ''The majority of the people I know are just helping each other out,'' Mr. Basso said. ''The way you or I would say, 'You want a ride cross town in a taxi?' the people I know might say, 'Can I give you a ride, or can I get a ride with you on Friday?' '' 
 The ride is not across town, of course, but from Palm Beach to Aspen, or Aspen to New York, or New York to Nantucket, or Nantucket to East Hampton, or East Hampton to Carmel. 
 ''It's like doing a friend a favor, you know?'' Mr. Basso said. ''Like, 'Oh, do you have room for my housekeeper and a dog?' ''

HEADLINE: The Global Tables Turn for REITs

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
INVESTORS have a new reason to chant the old real estate mantra: location, location, location. For most of this decade, foreign real estate funds have outperformed domestic funds, often by wide margins. But so far this year, the tables have turned.
 It has not been a great year for real estate investors of almost any stripe. The funds that put at least 75 percent of their assets into domestic real estate fell 3.9 percent, on average, in the first six months of this year. But the funds that invested at least 75 percent abroad plummeted 17.2 percent, according to Lipper. 
 That follows six consecutive years in which foreign funds outperformed domestic funds, often by a wide margin. From the beginning of 2002 through 2007, foreign funds chalked up average annual returns of 28.4 percent, versus 16.7 percent for domestic funds, according to Lipper.
 Some managers of domestic funds say that it was simply time for American real estate to outperform some hot foreign real estate markets, particularly in Asia. 
 ''As the money moved overseas, those stocks did well,'' said John G. Wenker, a co-manager of the First American Real Estate Securities fund, which primarily owns American real estate investment trusts, or REITs. ''But by the end of 2007, domestic REITs started to look like a better value proposition.''
 Mr. Wenker also said that some of the stronger domestic REITs might be poised to benefit from the tightness in the credit markets. He pointed to the agreement that a group of investors led by Boston Properties struck in May to buy the General Motors Building and three other Midtown Manhattan office towers from the Macklowe family for $3.95 billion.
 Boston Properties is one of the top holdings in the fund that Mr. Wenker manages, as is Vornado. Both of these office REITs focus on dense urban markets on the East Coast, including New York, Boston and Washington.
 ''The folks at Vornado and Boston Properties have strong balance sheets and a lot of dry powder, so they are able to go after those properties,'' Mr. Wenker said.
 First American Real Estate Securities has a share class that is no-load, meaning that it does not have a sales charge; it fell 4.1 percent in the second quarter, and lost 11.7 percent in the 12 months through June. It had a yield of 2.41 percent at the end of the second quarter. 
 Rising yields may be tempting some investors who fled American REITs last year, said David M. Lee, the manager of the T. Rowe Price Real Estate fund.
 That fund, which is no-load, fell 6.3 percent in the second quarter and was down 17 percent in the 12 months through June. It had a yield of 4.26 percent as of June 30. David Darst, the chief investment strategist of the global wealth management group at Morgan Stanley, cautioned investors in domestic REITs that they might be in jeopardy if the economy remains weak. ''If we are in a recession now, you are going to have pressure on hotel cash flows, on office rents, on shopping centers,'' Mr. Darst said.
 In some parts of the world, the reversal of fortunes has been stark, notably in Asia. 
 When measured in dollars, the total returns for the Asian component of the FTSE EPRA/Nareit index, which tracks global real estate, fell 22.8 percent in the first half this year, while the North American component of the index fell 4.4 percent. But in 2007, the Asian shares rose 15 percent while the North American REITs in the index fell by nearly 15 percent. 
 It was not always easy for mutual fund investors to know which real estate funds focused more at home or abroad. But in May, Lipper split the real estate funds that it tracks into three categories: domestic, global and foreign. The domestic funds keep at least 75 percent of their assets in the United States, while the foreign funds put at least 75 percent in other countries. The global funds fall somewhere between the two. 
 ''We don't want investors to be confused when they look at the real estate category,'' said Jeff Tjornehoj, a senior research analyst at Lipper. ''To look at them as one big group can gloss over big differences in performance between foreign and domestic.'' 
 NEXT month, Morningstar plans to divide the funds in its database into domestic and global real estate categories. The global funds will be those that put more than 40 percent of their assets abroad. 
 Russel Kinnel, the director of fund analysis at Morningstar, said regional considerations were more important in real estate than in some other sectors, like technology or pharmaceuticals. 
 ''In other industries, you have global competitors getting their revenues from all over the world,'' Mr. Kinnel said. ''But real estate is much more local.''

HEADLINE: In Changing Face Of Beijing, a Look At the New China

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
If Westerners feel dazed and confused upon exiting the plane at the new international airport terminal here, it's understandable. It's not just the grandeur of the space. It's the inescapable feeling that you're passing through a portal to another world, one whose fierce embrace of change has left Western nations in the dust.
 The sensation is comparable to the epiphany that Adolf Loos, the Viennese architect, experienced when he stepped off a steamship in New York Harbor more than a century ago. He had crossed a threshold into the future; Europe, he realized, was now culturally obsolete.
 Designed by Norman Foster, Beijing's glittering air terminal is joined by a remarkable list of other new monuments here: Paul Andreu's egg-shaped National Theater; Herzog & de Meuron's National Stadium, known as the bird's nest; PTW's National Aquatics Center, with its pillowy translucent exterior; and Rem Koolhaas's headquarters for the CCTV television authority, whose slanting, interconnected forms are among the most imaginative architectural feats in recent memory. 
 Critics have incessantly described these high-profile projects as bullish expressions of the nation's budding global primacy. Yet these buildings are not simply blunt expressions of power. Like the great monuments of 16th-century Rome or 19th-century Paris, China's new architecture exudes an aura that has as much to do with intellectual ferment as economic clout. 
 Each building, in its own way, embodies an intense struggle over the meaning of public space in the new China. And although at times terrifying in their aggressive scale, they also reflect the country's effort to give shape to an emerging national identity.
 Mr. Foster's airport terminal, the world's largest, is the purest expression of China's embrace of the Modernist creed. Its swooping form, which suggests two boomerangs placed side by side, has been compared to a dragon. Yet its real precedent is Tempelhof Airport in Berlin, a monument to air travel conceived by Albert Speer in the 1930s as a gateway to a new Europe. Both are part of a vision of a mobile society, one that extends back through Grand Central Terminal to the great train halls of Paris. 
 Like Tempelhof, the Beijing air terminal boasts a sweeping concourse that evokes the glamour of air travel while enclosing a surprisingly intimate interior. But Mr. Foster pushes the ideal of mobility to a new extreme. Guided by twinkling lights embedded in the terminal's ceiling, arriving visitors glide up ramped floors and across broad pedestrian bridges before spilling out onto the elevated concourse. From there they can disperse along a fluid network of roads, trains, subways, canals and parks whose tentacles extend out through the region.
 This sprawling web has completely reshaped Beijing since the city was awarded the Olympic Games seven years ago. It is impossible not to think of the enormous public works projects built in the United States at midcentury, when faith in technology's promise seemed boundless. Who would have guessed then that this faith would crumble for Americans, paving the way for a post-Katrina New Orleans just as the dream was being reborn in 21st-century China at 10 times the scale?
 Soaring Art, Deadening Frame
 Yet your sense of marvel at China's transformation is easily deflated on the drive from the airport. A banal landscape of ugly new towers flanks both sides. Many of those towers are sealed off in gated compounds, a reflection of the widening disparity between affluent and poor. Although most of them were built in the run-up to the Olympics, the poor quality of construction makes them look decrepit and decades old.
 It's the flip side of China's Modernist embrace: tabula rasa planning of the sort that also tainted the Modernist movement in Europe and the United States in the postwar years. China's architectural experiment thus brims with both promise and misery. Everything, it seems, is possible here, from utopian triumphs of the imagination to soul-sapping expressions of a disregard for individual lives.
 These tensions and contradictions are encoded in Mr. Andreu's National Theater, just west of Tiananmen Square. Topped by an elliptical titanium-and-glass dome and surrounded by a shallow reflecting pool, the theater complex stands along the Avenue of Eternal Peace, the great east-west corridor that borders Tiananmen Gate. 
 Lining the avenue are many of the Socialist landmarks built for the 10th anniversary of China's 1949 revolution, from the Great Hall of the People to the Beijing Railway Station and the Revolutionary Museum. The theater is one of the few major cultural monuments to rise in this historic core since Mao's mausoleum was built opposite the Forbidden Palace three decades ago.
 Over coffee in Beijing recently, Mr. Andreu described it as a place ''open to ordinary citizens.''
 ''It is a place that is very calm,'' he said. ''It is a building that you cannot touch. I didn't want to remove the mystery. You arrive through trees to the edge of the water. But you can also penetrate it. I wanted people to understand that this is for them.''
 Yet the building's symmetrical layout and monolithic scale invite other interpretations. The isolation imposed by the surrounding reflecting pool is reinforced by the entry sequence: visitors must descend a grand staircase into the earth before passing under the pool and re-emerging in the cavernous dome. It's as if the theater were connected to the city by a gigantic umbilical cord. 
 The entry passage suggests more haunting comparisons. Yan Meng, a Chinese architect who grew up in Beijing in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, told me that in the 1970s and '80s Tiananmen Square was in many ways the city's social heart. ''There were fewer cars, it was more accessible,'' he said as we drove past the square one afternoon. ''You would see people playing cards and flying kites.''
 After the Tiananmen Square protests and the government's violent crackdown in 1989, the city added pedestrian barriers around the square. Today it can be reached only through underpasses patrolled by security forces, an experience that is more bleak than intimidating. Once you emerge, the square feels like a tourist zone; the Chinese are there mostly to buy and sell cheap souvenirs. 
 Mr. Yan suggests that the National Theater's circuitous entry echoes the clampdown on public life after the 1989 massacre. ''It no longer belongs to anyone,'' he said of the square. ''It is about control.''
 Pushing What's Possible
 But some of the most imposing architectural symbols of China's rising stature reflect a more enlightened reading of how the future might unfold. At their most self-aware, they probe the edges of the possible. 
 The Olympic Stadium and the National Aquatics Center lie 10 miles north of the city center along its ancient ceremonial axis, putting them on par with the Forbidden City and Mao's mausoleum in national importance. Of the two, Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron's stadium is the more photographed and familiar symbol of the Games. Its huge elliptical form is enveloped in a dense latticework of steel columns.
 The columns, which twist and bend as they rise, are conceived as a gigantic work of public sculpture. Their outward thrust suggests they are straining to contain the activity inside. That intensity is strangely magnified when the building is empty, as if trembling in anticipation of a mass event.
 Yet a conflict over the stadium's future underscores tensions over how the new China will be defined. The stadium is in the center of a sprawling park surrounded by regimented rows of housing towers. After theGames, Mr. Herzog and Mr. de Meuron hope to transform the building into a vast public forum and a visual anchor for the community. 
 The government prefers to build a fence around it, which would eliminate the parklike openness that is one of its most attractive features. A local developer has proposed creating a subterranean shopping mall at one end of the structure, further undermining the design's public spirit.
 ''The building is made to be open,'' Mr. Herzog said. ''It is a work of public sculpture.'' Still, as the architect, all he can do is press for flexibility. ''Even if they put up a fence, they can take it down again one day in the future,'' he said hopefully.
 Mr. Koolhaas faces similar strains in his headquarters for CCTV, the state television authority, several miles to the south in Beijing's new business district. Long negotiations have unfolded over how much public access will be allowed: to the architect's distress, CCTV's directors have threatened to close off two public roads that cut through the site. An enormous plaza will also be restricted to the company's employees. 
 A year away from completion, the CCTV building has already attracted huge global attention and some controversy. Some have condemned Mr. Koolhaas for accepting the commission, likening it to participating in the 1931-33 competition for a Palace of the Soviets in Stalinist Russia. Essentially, they argue, he has designed a monument to a vast propaganda machine. 
 But the project is a formidable challenge to all of our expectations of what a monumental building should be. Like Mr. Herzog and Mr. de Meuron, Mr. Koolhaas is part of a generation of architects, now in their late 50s and early 60s, whose early careers were shaped in opposition to the oppressive formal purity of mainstream Modernism. They fashioned asymmetrical forms to break down the movement's monolithic scale and make room for outcasts and misfits. The problem they face now is how to adjust that language for clients that include authoritarian governments and multinational corporations. 
 In his design for the CCTV headquarters, Mr. Koolhaas begins by obliterating any trace of the human scale from the exteriors. There are no conventional windows, no clear indication of where the floors begin and end. The forms completely distort your perspective of the building; it seems to flatten out from some vantage points and bear down on you from others.
 As a result it is almost impossible to get a fix on the building's scale. Seen through the surrounding skyline of generic glass-and-steel towers, it sometimes seems to shrink to the size of a child's toy. From other angles it seems to be under a Herculean strain, as if fighting to support the enormous weight of the cantilevered floors above.
 This is not just a game. Mr. Koolhaas has set out to express the elasticity of the new global culture, and in the process explore ways architecture can bridge the gap between the intimate scale of the individual life and the whirling tide of mass society. The image of authority he conveys is pointedly ambiguous. Imposing at one moment, shy and retiring the next, the building's unstable forms say as much about collective anxieties as they do about centralized power.
 He has carved out ample space for places of social exchange. The interior of the building is conceived as an endless loop of public activities, with cafes, viewing decks and galleries extending up through one leg of the structure and back down through the other, where it connects to an underground subway.
 The architect sees the dividing line between public and private spheres as an active battleground, one that is constantly shifting and readjusting as society's norms change and evolve. For now, however, it is not the architect who will determine the degree of openness at CCTV but the company's government-appointed board of directors. 
 It remains to be seen where this will lead. For centuries, architects have aspired to create buildings that enlighten or transform civilization, only to see them remain isolated splendors, with little impact on society at large. That may prove to be the case in China, too. 
 But there is no question that its role as a great laboratory for architectural ideas will endure for years to come. One wonders if the West will ever catch up.

HEADLINE: Posturing and Abdication

 BODY:
The Bush administration made clear on Friday that it will do virtually nothing to regulate the greenhouse gases that cause global warming. With no shame and no apology, it stuck a thumb in the eye of the Supreme Court, repudiated its own scientists and exposed the hollowness of Mr. Bush's claims to have seen the light on climate change. 
 That is the import of an announcement by Stephen Johnson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, that the E.P.A. will continue to delay a decision on whether global warming threatens human health and welfare and requires regulations to address it. Mr. Johnson said his agency would seek further public comment on the matter, a process that will almost certainly stretch beyond the end of Mr. Bush's term. 
 The urgent problem of global warming demands urgent action. And the Supreme Court surely expected a speedier response when -- 15 months ago -- it ordered the E.P.A. to determine whether greenhouse gas pollution from vehicles (and, by extension, other sources) endangers human welfare and, if so, to issue regulations to limit emissions. 
 Mr. Bush initially promised to comply, and last December, a task force of agency scientists concluded that emissions do indeed endanger public welfare, that the E.P.A. is required to issue regulations, and that while remedial action could cost industry billions of dollars, the public welfare and the economy as a whole will benefit. 
 The agency sent its findings to the White House. The details of what happened next are not clear. But investigations by Senator Barbara Boxer and Representative Edward Markey have established that the White House, prodded by Vice President Dick Cheney's office, decided to ignore the findings -- refusing at first to even open the e-mail containing them and then asking Mr. Johnson to devise another response that would relieve the administration of taking prompt action.
 Along the way, the administration engaged in what Senator Boxer has aptly called a ''master plan'' to ensure that the E.P.A.'s response to the Supreme Court's decision would be as weak as possible.
 This campaign of obfuscation and intimidation included doctoring Congressional testimony on the health effects of climate change; ordering the E.P.A. to recompute its numbers to minimize the economic benefits of curbing carbon dioxide; and promoting the fiction that the modest fuel-economy improvements in last year's energy bill would solve the problem of carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles. 
 All this is unfortunate but not surprising. Mr. Bush spent years denying there was a climate change problem. And while he no longer denies the science, he still insists on putting the concerns of industry over the needs of the planet. 
 We were skeptical last week when Mr. Bush joined other world leaders in a pledge to halve global greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century. We worried that without nearer-term targets there would be too little pressure on governments to act. Now we have no doubt that he was merely posturing. The next president, armed with the E.P.A.'s findings, can and must do better.

HEADLINE: Rich, But Rejected

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
ALMOST overnight, investment bankers and others on Wall Street have gone from being Manhattan's most aggressive apartment buyers to real estate pariahs. 
 As financial services companies continue to cut jobs and bleed billions of dollars, their employees have far less cash to spend on high-priced apartments, and very little optimism about taking a risk right now anyway. 
 Those in the financial industry who still want to buy real estate are often unable to persuade lenders and co-op boards to work with them. 
 The biggest problem is that buyers who work on Wall Street no longer have the guarantee of huge bonuses to bolster their financial status. And even those who continue to get bonuses are finding that banks and co-ops will not let them count all that money as part of their income, because unlike a salary, it can fluctuate wildly. 
 Workers in financial services-related businesses make up roughly 25 to 30 percent of Manhattan buyers, according to estimates by Halstead Property. Although some lenders and building boards are accepting these buyers after tightening requirements, others are becoming far more interested in buyers outside the financial industry.
 ''They're looking for people who have stable incomes that are not so market dependent,'' said Melissa Cohn, the president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, who has noticed the changing standards regarding bonuses in the last month. 
 Lenders, she said, fear that ''bonus levels won't be the same in 2009 as they were in 2008'' and will no longer take any risks.
 The problems facing buyers from Wall Street won't necessarily cause Manhattan apartment prices to slide drastically, said Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property, though they could result in slightly less competition for properties and prompt more sellers to negotiate. 
 Buyers who work in finance are having trouble with both co-ops and condominiums. Some co-op boards are rejecting bankers even when they appear to be financially qualified, or they are demanding as a condition of approval that many months of maintenance payments be provided upfront. 
 Tighter home mortgage standards are also affecting some condo sales. 
 In the past, Wall Street workers would count most or all of their year-end bonuses to qualify for mortgages, often borrowing amounts that covered 90 percent or even 100 percent of the purchase price of high-end condos. Now, some lenders allow buyers to count just a third of their bonus. A banker who qualified for a $3.75 million mortgage a year ago based on a $250,000 salary and a $1 million bonus now qualifies for only a $1.8 million mortgage with the same salary and bonus. 
 At the same time, some lenders are demanding 25 percent down, rather than just 10 percent. Thus, a banker who went to contract on a $4 million apartment a year ago with a $400,000 down payment now has to come up with $600,000 more to close the deal. 
 The bonus situation is expected to get worse before it gets better. Alan Johnson, the managing director of Johnson Associates, a company that tracks compensation data, said that Wall Street bonuses are projected to be 30 to 40 percent lower in 2008 than in 2007. ''It's going to be the toughest year in at least five years,'' he said.
 He predicts that bonuses will not pick up until 2010.
 The buying habits of bankers also matter more during this slowdown because the financial services industry has become a larger percentage of the city's economy than ever before. 
 Rick Wohlfarth, a Manhattan real estate broker for three decades, said that during the economic slowdown of the late 1980s, fewer people had Wall Street jobs and he could count on a more diverse pool of buyers.
 Now, his firm's 18 agents are advising 60 clients who work in finance and are struggling to buy or sell apartments when market conditions have turned against them.
 ''This downturn is more profound because it has hit the largest customer base we've had,'' he said.
 The slowdown in sales, however, has not yet hurt Manhattan apartment prices. Data released earlier this month show that while the number of transactions fell, the average apartment sales price of $1.6 million is a third higher than a year ago, according to Halstead. These numbers have risen mainly because of high prices for brand-new condos at 15 Central Park West and the converted Plaza Hotel. 
 While many bankers and other Wall Street workers interviewed for this article would not speak for the record because they feared being laid off or jeopardizing their severance packages, their lawyers, real estate brokers and mortgage brokers said they were struggling with shrinking bank balances and new buying standards that in some cases might mean they could lose apartments they had already signed contracts to buy. 
 Peter Graubard, a real estate lawyer, said that about 5 percent of his firm's clients were struggling to get financing on apartments that they decided to buy a year ago, when the buildings were still under construction. 
 One couple, who both work in finance, put down a $250,000 payment for a $2.5 million condo at the Element at 555 West 59th Street. Then they lost their jobs. Even though the husband found a new job, the lenders won't give the couple a mortgage because their salary total has dropped and they depend on bonus income. 
 By the July 7 deadline, the couple had not found a lender willing to give them a mortgage. So they sent a letter to the developer that day asking for more time, the ability to assign the contract to another buyer before closing or the option to buy a less expensive apartment in the building.
 Other buyers are simply backing out of deals. Josh Guberman, the chief executive of the Core Development Group, found that bankers had been his most active buyers on his five condo projects in the last decade. But in the last three months, four bankers have backed out while negotiating contracts at his buildings at 157 East 84th Street and 433 East 74th Street because they were worried about the financial markets or couldn't get mortgages they wanted. 
 Mr. Guberman said the most striking case involved a buyer who had signed a contract and paid about $20,000 in architecture and engineering fees before backing out of a $5.7 million apartment at the building on 84th Street. His deposit was returned. 
 ''Our base of clients for years was always the finance guys,'' Mr. Guberman said. ''They were the guys who stepped up.'' 
 Mr. Guberman has now started educating buyers about changing lending standards well before going to contract. He tells them not to expect to include their bonus income when qualifying for mortgages. He also advises them that lenders will require them to make 25 percent down payments, supply 12 months of financial and bank statements and four to five years of tax returns. (He previously told clients they needed three months of documents and two years of tax returns.)
 Other bankers are trying to stay away from deals that require co-op board approval. Chris Poore, a broker for the Corcoran Group, recently worked with a banker who bid on an $800,000 co-op and had the offer accepted. But the banker withdrew the offer when he heard that co-ops were tightening requirements and not factoring bonus income into deals, and instead bought a sponsor unit co-op that didn't require board approval.
 In some cases, co-ops are rejecting bankers outright. 
 Felix Nihamin, a real estate lawyer, recently advised a couple who work in finance and who tried to buy a $740,000 co-op on East 77th Street. While the husband and wife felt their jobs were safe, they took steps to ensure board approval. They put down 20 percent of the purchase price, offered a parent with a multimillion-dollar net worth as a guarantor and offered to pay extra maintenance costs upfront. Under these terms, a lender approved them for a $560,000 mortgage. But the co-op board rejected them before even meeting with them.
 ''Everything else was perfect,'' Mr. Nihamin said. ''The board did not like that they received the chunk of their income from bonuses.''
 Michele Kleier, the president of Gumley Haft Kleier, recently represented a woman buying a three-bedroom co-op on the Upper East Side. At the time, the financial company that employed the woman had suffered so badly from the subprime mortgage crisis that she did not receive a bonus for 2007. 
 The co-op board asked her for seven years of tax returns and detailed references showing how much she was valued at her firm. After the review, the board accepted her. She moved in late in the spring, and soon after, obtained a higher-paying job at another company.
 ''They took a risk on her and said that they thought she was very bright,'' Ms. Kleier said. ''She wasn't somebody they thought was just lucky.''
 Amy Herman, a Halstead broker, recently prepared one client who works for a top bank for his board interview for a one-bedroom prewar co-op in the East 70s. 
 In addition to providing salary and bonus information, her client gathered numbers about how many people had been laid off from his bank, how the firm's layoff numbers compared with other major banks' numbers and how his division had performed. He also assured the board that he wouldn't go to business school and take on student loan debt or try to sublet the apartment. 
 Ms. Herman said one thing in his favor was that his career in finance was short enough and his salary low enough that his bank still paid him in cash and not company stock. So the board accepted him and he moved in last month. 
 Ms. Herman fears that some bankers may not be willing to work so hard to impress boards. 
 ''It's a really fine line,'' she said. ''If they do start hunkering down and go to an extreme toward people in the financial world, you're going to absolutely see a decline in prices. That's one out of every three buyers that you're going to be eliminating or giving a hard time.''

HEADLINE: A Small Volkswagen, Made in Brazil

BYLINE: By AZADEH ENSHA

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to our driving habits, perhaps it's time we Americans take a cue from our overseas counterparts.
 Take Brazil, for example, where for the past 21 years, the best-selling car has been the cheap supermini Volkswagen Gol (base price is about $18,000). 
 Recently, Volkswagen Brazil released its latest model Gol. Not to be confused with the VW Golf, which was sold for many years in America, the 2008 Gol is a four-door and available with a 1-liter or 1.6-liter engine. Like all VWs made in Brazil, the Gol can run on gasoline or ethanol.
 With rising fuel prices, VW has big plans for the small car. The new Gol's first television commercial features the supermodel Gisele Bundchen and Sylvester Stallone, who drives the Gol, and outruns a team of Hummers through fires and other obstacles.
 The Gol ranks as the fifth most-produced VW after the Golf, Passat, Polo and Jetta. But it could quickly move up that list. There are reports that VW is thinking about exporting the Gol to more emerging markets in Eastern Europe and Asia, where it could compete with other cheap new superminis, like the Dacia Logan.
 Although an early iteration of the Gol was sold in America as the VW Fox in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there are no plans to offer the latest Gol in the United States.
 A study that was released by Edmunds.com, a Web site that provides information for auto buyers, includes a list of the top 10 cheapest cars to own in the United States, based on cost per mile. The Chevrolet Aveo ranked as the cheapest to drive over a five-year period, with the Hyundai Accent ranked second and the Honda Fit third. 
 ''Bigger vehicles, like S.U.V.'s and trucks, consume too much fuel and are more expensive to buy for our economic reality,'' said Guilherme Testa, a spokesman for VW Brazil, about his region. ''It's too much. We need small cars that are low-maintenance and low-cost. They consume less fuel. They use total flex fuel technology, so you can put in gasoline or ethanol and the car will go on. The country needs it. Our traffic is chaotic. Here in Sao Paulo, we have one of the worst cases of traffic in the world, so if you have S.U.V.'s, you won't go anywhere.''
 Sounds vaguely familiar.

HEADLINE: Deferred Hopes and Stalled Projects

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
WHEN word came last December that work had stopped at the Esperanza, the centerpiece of Asbury Park's long-awaited beachside redevelopment, even the project's name -- ''hope'' in Spanish -- seemed to mock the city's aspirations. 
 ''I know a lot of people were very much stunned, and upset,'' said Dean Geibel, the principal of Metro Homes, the developer of the double-tower condominium, for which only the foundation has been completed. 
 The Esperanza was starting to rise on the site of a previous failure, where a steel skeleton had stood for two decades, menacing prospects for revitalization. ''And we were sort of the first big project in New Jersey to take a hit when the financial market turned sour,'' Mr. Geibel said.
 Since then, destructive market forces have slowed progress on other large projects around the state. Work has sputtered to a stop at two of them -- the $1.5 billion Centuria development at the foot of the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, and the $66 million Town Center development in Somerville -- before foundations have even been laid.
 ''These large projects are facing trouble,'' said Andrew J. Merin, a broker who is currently marketing the rights to build Centuria, ''because financing is almost impossible today.''
 Mr. Merin, a vice chairman of Cushman & Wakefield who is based in East Rutherford, said banks had all but ceased making construction loans for projects costing more than $50 million. And investors are holding back, looking for the ''rich returns'' that mixed-use real estate projects do not currently guarantee.
 Mr. Merin said a number of developers were bidding to develop some portion of Centuria. But Fort Lee officials have their hearts set on a redevelopment plan that requires one ''master developer'' to produce about 500 rental apartments, more than 150,000 square feet of retail space, an office building and a hotel.
 The current developer, the Town and Country Corporation of Manhattan, bought the 16-acre Centuria site from the Helmsley Organization in 2003, and then laid out millions of dollars to clean up contaminated soil, Mr. Merin said. By the time the site preparation was finished, the financing situation had turned grim.
 Also in 2003, Edgewood Properties bought its Somerville project site, a run-down strip mall that was to be demolished. The project, which envisions 272 apartments, retail shops and office space, became mired in delays because of a lawsuit brought by the Pathmark grocery chain, which operated a store in the strip mall. Now, the project is ''on hold,'' until the market improves, according to the developer and city officials. 
 Meanwhile, in Asbury Park, Mr. Geibel is working feverishly on a scaled-down plan -- and on securing reduced financing -- with the goal of beginning work afresh by the end of the year.
 This summer, city redevelopment officials worked out a new agreement with the builder, acknowledging that a redesign of Esperanza would take into account ''current economic and market realities, and is likely to involve fewer amenities, smaller units and a shorter structure.'' 
 Last week, Mr. Geibel said the condo towers were likely to be 12 or 13 stories high, rather than 10 and 16 stories as originally planned. ''We have been spending a lot of time lately with professionals on the cutting edge of the construction industry, and learning everything possible about the most cost-efficient ways to build,'' he said. 
 ''This is still going to be a beautiful building with extravagant amenities,'' he said, ''but we'll be more sensible about the way we construct it.''
 Limiting the building's height, for example, permits use of a new ''panelized'' material that is a far less expensive alternative to poured concrete flooring, Mr. Geibel said. Redesigning balconies to be recessed, rather than extending out, also reduces construction costs, because work scaffolding can be erected all at once, flat across an exterior wall.
 The new structure will rise on the existing foundation, Mr. Geibel said, but it will have a new layout with smaller one-, two- and three-bedroom units -- and fewer design configurations. 
 ''Previously, we had 84 different designs, which might have been rather excessive,'' he said, ''but we were trying to offer everything, for everybody.'' 
 Now, the project architect, Dean Marchetto of Hoboken, is creating far fewer, in an array to be repeated on every floor. And he is working with fresh data profiling the most likely buyers, compiled for Metro Homes by the New Jersey market analyst Jeffrey Otteau, rather than ''just reaching for the stars'' in terms of features, Mr. Geibel explained.
 He added that he was negotiating with CapitalOne, the original lender for the project, hoping to ''recapitalize'' it with a smaller loan. In addition, the national real estate company Madison Marquette, which is leading the rebuilding of Asbury Park's boardwalk, retail and theater space -- and which recently bought out the Kushner Company's condominium project at one end of the beach -- has indicated it might invest in the Esperanza, which is at the beachfront's center.
 Mr. Geibel said the project would be given a new name -- its third. It was originally to have been called the Rising, in honor of a song by Bruce Springsteen, and of Asbury Park's comeback, but Mr. Springsteen demurred.
 A contest among Asbury Park schoolchildren produced the name Esperanza. ''It was a great name,'' Mr. Geibel said, ''but this is going to be a different building, a building that will fit the market, and the times.''

HEADLINE: Reaping the Fruits Of Globalization

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
TO his credit, Mohamed El-Erian has set himself an ambitious goal with ''When Markets Collide'' (McGraw Hill, $27.95). 
 Mr. El-Erian, the co-chief executive of Pimco,the money management firm, wants to explain the current turmoil in the global markets, outline what investors should do to take advantage of the changing landscape, and offer advice to policy makers about how to handle the rapidly changing, and increasingly interrelated, global economy.
 The results are mixed. The book works best in explaining what investment strategies to follow. Mr. El-Erian, the former president and chief executive of the Harvard Management Company, which invests the university's endowment, offers extremely detailed advice. Understanding the danger of a one-size-fits-all-approach, he couches his suggestions in the form of ranges, saying that investors should have between X and Y percent of their holdings in a particular asset class. 
 Even so, his recommendations are surprising.
 If you are a long-term investor, Mr. El-Erian suggests placing as little as 36 percent of your money in equities, less than most professionals recommend. And he advocates having no more than 62 percent there, even for aggressive investors, a figure that is also lower than traditional advice.
 To simplify the discussion, let's just deal with the midpoint of his recommended range for various asset classes. The midpoint for stocks, for example, would be 49 percent, or halfway from 36 to 62.
 That 49 percent should break down this way, he writes: 15 percent in domestic stocks, another 15 percent in equities of companies that are part of ''other advanced economies,'' 12 percent in stocks of companies in ''emerging economies'' and 7 percent in private equity invested through vehicles like hedge funds.
 The goal is to ensure that you have a ''globally diversified set of stocks,'' he writes. ''While international investing does involve a different set of risks,'' he says, ''the cumulative impact of risk has been declining in recent years when compared in relative terms to domestic investing.''
 He adds that increased international exposure is justified because, when it comes to stock appreciation, ''a faltering U.S. engine of global growth will be replaced by several emerging-market engines.''
 For example, he points out that ''when measured using purchasing power parity, China and India each contributed more to global growth in 2007 than did the United States, the European Union and Japan.''
 Given Mr. El-Erian's association with Pimco, which has $800 billion in assets under management and is one of the world's largest fixed-income specialists, his bond recommendations may also seem unexpected. 
 He believes that a long-term investor should have just 19 percent of his or her money in bonds, split among international (9 percent), domestic (5 percent) and inflation-protected bonds (5 percent). 
 As for the remaining 31 percent of your assets, he recommends that they be divided among commodities, real estate, infrastructure -- water and road authorities, for instance -- and special opportunities, which range from carbon credits to investment in distressed debt.
 These recommendations flow from Mr. El-Erian's forecast for the economic landscape's evolution in coming years. 
 For example, he expects ''a reduction in global trade and payment imbalances, the return of more pronounced inflationary pressures and a more diversified allocation of investible funds around the world.''
 But while his recommendations for where to put your money are clear, it can be hard to follow the logic that led to them. Mr. El-Erian spent 15 years at the International Monetary Fund, where, among other things, he did policy and strategy work. The book seems to assume that readers will have considerable understanding of global finance. 
 And the writing style does not help. On more than one occasion, he lapses into Alan Greenspanesque circumlocutions. Here, from the chapter on investing, the most accessible in the book, is a sentence that is more representative than a reader might like: ''The ideal situation is to come up with a small set (three to five) of distinct (and ideally orthogonal) risk factors that command a risk premium.''
 Later on in that same paragraph the reader is confronted with this: ''The end product is a more robust and time-consistent combination of asset classes that map clearly to the underlying factors.''
 As for the policy recommendations, it is hard to quibble with calls for greater transparency, a need for officials to be willing to ''seek new sources of policy-related information'' and comments like this: ''governments will need to develop a better understanding of the new realities of the financial system and respond accordingly.'' 
 But respond how? The book doesn't say.
 And as for what, if anything, policy makers should do about income inequalities, his answer is less complete than you might like. He says that ''the vast majority of people are better off in the world with the important qualification that, within most countries those that are already well-off are gaining at a better rate than the poor.''
 ''This poses an interesting issue for government policy,'' he adds. ''Should they focus on the absolute or the relative?''
 He responds, again, by saying, ''There is no easy answer,'' although he goes on to suggest that government spending on education, specifically on skill acquisition and expanded training, as well as making access to ''health care easier and more effective'' could offset the inequalities to some degree.
 That makes sense, even if it is not a particularly novel suggestion.
 In the end, the reader is left wishing that Mr. El-Erian were as clear about the causes of the global financial transformation, and the appropriate policy responses to it, as he is about how to realize its benefits.

HEADLINE: A Backyard Gusher? Only in My Dreams

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
THE root of many problems these days comes down to one word: commodities. Wheat and corn prices are driving up the cost of food. Fuel prices are driving up the cost of everything. Pork bellies are in there somewhere, mystifyingly. 
 I don't claim to understand what's going on, but it's getting scary. I need to stop living at the mercy of the commodities producers, and get into the act myself. ''Commodities maven'' has a nice ring to it.
 This puts me in mind of a question that my son, Sam, asked at the age of 10: ''Dad, what's a job where you make a lot of money without doing much work?''
 At the time, I suggested that he look into being born rich, and explained that the timing of such a transaction would be tricky for him. I had no other ideas. Of course, that was before we knew anything about Richard Grasso, the former head of the New York Stock Exchange, who recently won his tenacious battle to keep the $140 million he earned for ... well, it's really hard to say what the head of the New York Stock Exchange actually does that would merit that kind of money. All I know is that somewhere, Ralph Kramden is smiling. 
 We can't all be Grassos. Still, maybe we -- and, by we, I mean I -- can still find a path to easy money. Picking stocks certainly hasn't done the job for me, or for a lot of other people I know. And it turns out that you actually can go wrong in real estate.
 That's where commodities come in. First, I looked into black gold, Texas tea. Well, geologists say I'm out of luck. New Jersey is not a major producer of oil: there won't be a pump jack in my backyard anytime soon. We live in one of those prim suburbs where people's homes tend to be polished gems and their lawns are perfect. We fall short of that standard, though we don't quite have a Chevy up on blocks in the front. But a pump jack wouldn't seem too far out of the norm for us -- sort of like our decaying jungle gym, but kinetic. 
 What about minerals? New Jersey is skimpy on that front, according to the National Mining Association, with less than 1 percent of the nation's nonfuel mineral production annually. I was briefly thrilled when I read about greensand marl, a mineral that is mined in New Jersey to the tune of several million dollars worth a year. It's apparently used as an organic fertilizer and a water softener. 
 But a call to Karl W. Muessig, the state geologist of New Jersey, dashed my hopes. ''We always look at it and hope it takes off like gold this year, but it never has,'' he told me. Besides, he explained, it's found in central and southern New Jersey, not anywhere near my home. ''You're out of luck,'' he said. 
 I checked with my friend Diana Henriques, a reporter here at the paper who has been writing wonderful articles about the commodities markets. She did her best to warn me off of bellies. ''We have a glut'' right now, she said. ''People who are farming pork bellies have pushed a lot of it out to market,'' in large part because of the rising costs of feed and transportation. The economics are iffy, she added, ''not to mention how it would affect your neighbors.'' 
 She has a point. My fellow white-collar suburbanites might find a pump jack charmingly rustic, but the smells and squeals of a pigpen could bring down the wrath of the local zoning board. That is, unless I really struck it rich with the porkers. Then the fanciest of my neighbors might think about a sty to call their own -- they have mortgages and fuel bills, too -- and find a way to call it green. We'd be happy as pigs in, well, what pigs wallow in. But Diana had talked me out of it.
 CROPS sounded like a sure thing, since I live in the Garden State. That is, until I talked with Michael Schop, a master gardener working with the Cooperative Extension Service of Rutgers University. He was not very encouraging about getting any kind of big cash crop out of the eighth of an acre in my backyard. But he brightened for a moment.
 ''You want to flood your backyard and grow rice?'' he asked. This, I mentioned, might be unpopular with, yes, the neighbors.
 ''For the kind of property you have,'' he said, ''the feasibility is nil.''
 The prospects became even worse when I called William Alexander, the author of ''The $64 Tomato: How One Man Nearly Lost His Sanity, Spent a Fortune, and Endured an Existential Crisis in the Quest for the Perfect Garden.'' His new project was growing wheat in order to bake bread ''really from scratch.'' Well, his first crop, with less than 100 square feet of space in his Hudson Valley garden and a few dollars worth of seeds, yielded 20 pounds of wheat. Sounds great!
 But then came the threshing and winnowing -- two words that had little meaning for him before he set out. ''My wife and I spent six hours beating the daylights out of our wheat with various instruments of violence generally seen only in S.& M. movies,'' he said, ''and before it was all over, I understood only too well why the Latin word for the threshing board is 'tribulum,' which has the same origin as tribulation.''
 He said that at the end of the day, his wife, Anne, ''collapsed onto the lawn, exhausted, and had just one request: 'Promise me you won't grow cotton next summer.'''
 Naysayers everywhere I turn. 
 So here's my plan: I'm going to trade futures, because it means never having to get my hands dirty. People in Congress are saying that the speculators are the ones driving the price of oil. The price increases certainly could not be a result of the simple laws of supply and demand, or of limited production capacity and bottomless need for resources in the developing world. 
 Because I always believe what my members of Congress say, I have to figure that the speculators are getting rich. So why not me? I found a site on the Internet that promises to teach me how to make a lot of money without having to do much work. Sounds perfect!
 Meanwhile, I'm going to hang a bell in the backyard and ring it every morning, or invite some buddies in to do it for me. Mr. Grasso seems to think that job is worth millions. Maybe it will pay for that online course.
 If the neighbors complain about the bell, I'll just explain how narrowly they missed the greensand marl pit, the rice paddy and the pigsty. 
 I'm sure they'll be grateful.

 BODY:
Q I live in a rent-stabilized apartment and have installed my own locks on the front door. My landlord is planning to replace these locks with his own. 
 Is this allowed? 
 A Sherwin Belkin, a Manhattan lawyer who represents landlords, said New York State's Multiple Dwelling Law provides that a tenant of a multifamily dwelling -- with a few exceptions -- has the right to install his or her own lock.
 Mr. Belkin said the tenant may replace the landlord's lock or put in a new lock in addition to the lock installed by the owner. To avoid an unnecessary dispute with the landlord, Mr. Belkin said, the tenant should inform the landlord if he wants to put in a new lock in addition to the lock installed by the owner. In either case, the tenant must give a duplicate key to the landlord.
 Exceptions to this provision include tenants who live in buildings controlled by a municipal housing authority, in a hotel or motel, or in a college or school dormitory. 
 How 'Preferential'
 Are Some Rents?
 Q I just moved into an apartment and signed a lease for $1,850. Someone told me that I may be paying a ''preferential rent,'' so I looked again at the documents. The lease was on a form used for rent-stabilized tenants, and there was a section saying that the ''market rate'' was $2,009 a month. 
 Do I have rent-stabilized status? What can the landlord legally do in terms of raising the rent when the lease is up for renewal? 
 A Lucas A. Ferrara, a Manhattan real estate lawyer and adjunct professor of law at New York Law School, said a ''preferential rent,'' which is a reduced rent charged to a regulated tenant, can be temporary or permanent, depending on the language in the lease.
 If temporary, the landlord may impose a higher rent -- that is, the legal regulated rent plus any allowable increase -- at the time of lease renewal. If permanent, the landlord can base increases only on the preferential rent.
 It is not clear from the letter whether the writer is rent-stabilized, Mr. Ferrara said. If the legal rent for a vacant apartment is $2,000 or more, the apartment may be deregulated.
 ''The fact that the landlord is stating that the 'market rate' for the apartment is $2,009 a month seems to indicate that the apartment has been deregulated,'' Mr. Ferrara said. ''And if the apartment has been deregulated, using a rent-stabilized lease form, or charging less than $2,000 a month, doesn't resubject the apartment to regulation.'' 
 Mr. Ferrara said that if the apartment is not regulated, the landlord can charge as much or as little as he or she wishes -- subject to any terms in the lease that deal with increases -- when the lease expires.
 The writer can determine the regulatory status of the apartment by calling the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal at (718) 739-6400.

HEADLINE: Three Ways to Mine Energy's Riches

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
AS oil prices rose like a gusher on the Texas plains, many energy funds rode the surging value of crude to double-digit returns in the second quarter. Some of the top-performing funds for the period managed to exploit the energy boom without specializing in the sector.
 Keeley Mid Cap Value invested in companies that are restructuring. Fidelity Leveraged Company Stock scooped up the stock of businesses laden with debt, especially junk-bond issuers. And T. Rowe Price Latin America sought opportunities in the swath of land stretching from Tijuana to Tierra del Fuego. And all three tolerated higher-than-average risk in pursuit of rich returns. 
 A Road Less Traveled
 John L. Keeley Jr., president and chief investment officer of Keeley Funds, said he gravitated to restructurings years ago, when he realized that few money managers hunted there. His Keeley Mid Cap Value fund, which returned 12.6 percent in the second quarter and 2.7 percent for the 12 months through June, invested in such offbeat fare as recently bankrupt companies, spin-offs from established businesses, and savings institutions converting from mutual to stock ownership. (It was also a strong performer for all of 2007, with a return of 21.7 percent.) 
 Mr. Keeley doesn't muck about in bankruptcy reorganizations, demanding changes in a company's operations. Rather, he waits until it re-emerges and sketches out its map for renewed profitability. ''The company has to give the court a five-year business plan,'' he said. ''There should be a high degree of truth in it. They're kind of writing a research report for you.'' 
 That approach has led him to such stocks as Joy Global, a Milwaukee maker of coal mining equipment, formerly known as Harnischfeger Industries.
 Mr. Keeley also seeks companies with odd assets that don't dovetail with the main business. Thus, he bought shares in Walter Industries, of Tampa, Fla., which is best known as a homebuilder but also had a metallurgical coal business, he said. ''Then all of the sudden there's a worldwide shortage of steel,'' he said, ''and the cost of that coal goes from $100 to $300 a ton.'' 
 His fund, which levies an upfront sales charge of 4.5 percent, started in 2005 and remains relatively small, with $111 million in assets. But Mr. Keeley has managed money for more than three decades, and his company has three other mutual funds, including Keeley Small Cap Value, with $7.3 billion in assets. The midcap offering carries an expense ratio of 1.39 percent. 
 Of Debt and Energy
 Thomas T. Soviero, manager of Fidelity Leveraged Company Stock, has long liked riskier-than-average fare. He formerly oversaw Fidelity's junk-bond fund and today invests about two-thirds of his fund's assets in the shares of companies whose bonds qualify as junk. 
 ''It's easier to make money in a company where people throw out the annual report because they see a lot of debt,'' he said. ''What's garbage for some is treasure for me.''
 Mr. Soviero also makes hefty sector bets -- he'll decide that a particular part of the economy seems ready to sizzle and plow a big chunk of the fund's assets into it. Lately, energy fit that description, accounting for more than 40 percent of his $8.6 billion portfolio this spring.
 ''I could see a scenario where we'd have high oil prices for a long time, with big demand in China and India and geopolitical problems in Iran, Venezuela and Nigeria,'' which are among the world's top producers, he said.
 Mr. Soviero has wagered on oil even with some nonenergy holdings. One of his biggest in March was Teekay, an oil-and-gas shipper based in the Marshall Islands. Though Mr. Soviero's fund typically holds 200 stocks, his top 20 usually account for about half of the assets. The fund, which carries no sales charge, had an expense ratio of 0.83 percent in June. Besides returning 17.5 percent in the second quarter, it put up a strong five-year performance, with an annualized average return of 23.2 percent. 
 Mr. Soviero achieved those numbers not just by piling money into promising sectors but by also avoiding sketchy ones. Lately, for example, he has shunned financial stocks, whose woes have dragged down many other funds. ''I had less than 1 percent there for the last three years,'' he said. ''You got to the point where money was too easy to get, and that ultimately will lead to problems for the people doing the lending.''
 Profit in Latin America
 Both oil drillers and lenders have found their way into Gonzalo S. Pangaro's portfolio at T. Rowe Price Latin America. In May, each sector accounted for about a fifth of the fund's assets. 
 Like Mr. Soviero, Mr. Pangaro said that he expected energy prices to remain high and has invested accordingly. One of his biggest recent holdings was Pe- troleo Brasileiro, the Brazilian driller. ''It's managing to grow its oil production in the high single digits,'' when many producers aren't, he pointed out.
 Not every oil-producing country in Latin America attracts the interest of Mr. Pangaro, a native of Argentina who works out of London. Venezuela has bigger reserves than Brazil, but he steers clear of it because its government has exerted control over private oil fields. Mr. Pangaro said that he preferred to invest in places like Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Chile.
 Commodity prices in general, not just oil, have risen over the last several years. That has given a boost to Latin America, a big commodities producer, and to Latin America funds in general, some of which have done even better recently than Mr. Pangaro's fund. The resulting economic growth helped Mr. Pangaro achieve not only strong performance in the second quarter -- 8.6 percent -- but also an annualized average return of 46.7 percent over the last five years. His fund has no sales charge and has an expense ratio of 1.2 percent. 
 Mr. Pangaro cautioned that investors shouldn't let Latin America's recent heady returns entice them to commit too much money to what remains a volatile region.
 ''It's done well over the last five years, but if you look at 10 years, it's traded sideways,'' he said. ''People should have a long-term horizon to invest in Latin America, and they shouldn't allocate a significant portion of their savings.''

HEADLINE: Dissident's Tale Of Epic Escape From Iran's Vise

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE and MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After three days on the run, Ahmad Batebi picked his way down a rocky slope to the stream that marked Iran's border with Iraq. His Kurdish guides, who had led Mr. Batebi, an Iranian dissident, through minefields and dodged nighttime gunfire from border guards, passed him to a new team of shadowy human smugglers. 
 At the age of 31, after nearly eight years in Iranian prisons, subjected to torture and twice taken to the gallows and fitted with a noose, Mr. Batebi had fled.
 But in Iraq, his former captors had one more chilling message for him. Not long after his arrival in Erbil in March, the new cellphone provided by United Nations officials rang. Mr. Batebi was shocked to hear the familiar voice of the chief interrogator at one of Iran's notorious prisons. 
 ''We know where you are,'' the interrogator said. ''You must turn yourself in.''
 Instead, Mr. Batebi, one of Iran's best-known dissidents, received permission to enter the United States. He arrived on June 24. 
 In several lengthy interviews, Mr. Batebi provided an unusual window on Iran under its ruling clerics. His alienation began at age 9, when he witnessed a deadly stoning. He rose to fame in 1999, appearing on the cover of The Economist magazine holding the bloody T-shirt of a fellow student demonstrator -- an image he first saw when a judge slapped it before him and declared, ''You have signed your own death sentence.'' Finally, after a decade of political combat, he reluctantly decided to abandon Iran for an uncertain exile.
 His escape has prompted a paroxysm of denunciation in Iran's controlled news media, which have accused him of defrauding creditors and suggested that he has long been in league with the United States and Israel, claims that human rights groups dismiss as crude propaganda.
 From his Yahoo blog, Mr. Batebi has replied, posting the taunt, ''Your hands will never reach me'' and the instruction ''Click here.'' The photograph that pops up shows the dissident, an Iranian Johnny Depp with a ponytail and a satisfied expression, posing in front of the United States Capitol.
 While some details of Mr. Batebi's biography, his treatment in Iran and his escape could not be independently confirmed, he provided a video he took during his journey, and independent advocates vouched for much of his account.
 He knows he has arrived during a time of tension between Iran and the United States, and he said he did not want his story to heighten the conflict.
 Wary of being viewed as a pawn of American policy, he said that the United States played no role in his departure from Iran, a fact American officials confirmed. The United States did give him permission to enter this country ''out of concern for his safety,'' said Gordon D. Johndroe, the spokesman for the National Security Council. He said Mr. Batebi attended a courtesy meeting with N.S.C. staff members on Friday.
 Despite Mr. Batebi's soft-spoken Persian, translated by Lily Mazahery, an Iranian-American lawyer who is helping him resettle, his contempt for Iran's rulers is palpable. But he does not want a violent revolution. ''No one with a healthy brain wants a revolution without a plan for what comes after,'' he said. ''That's what happened in 1979.''
 An Awakening
 Mr. Batebi may have inherited his jaundiced view of his country's leaders. After the Islamic revolution of 1979, his father, a customs bureaucrat who had fallen out of favor with the shah's regime, declined to join the Revolutionary Guards. His mother, a first-grade teacher, taught him and his younger brother and sister a mild, Golden Rule Islam that had little in common with the ayatollahs' harsh theology.
 His own awakening began in fourth grade, when his teacher, fed up with the distortions of an official history textbook, burst out: ''Go out and read other things to try to get the truth.''
 ''The teacher probably doesn't even remember,'' Mr. Batebi said. ''But he changed the course of my life.''
 A few weeks later came the stoning. Though forbidden by his mother, he slipped out of the house to see the commotion near his school. He saw a man, accused of adultery, buried to the waist, his head covered with a sack that turned red as Revolutionary Guards hurled chunks of concrete. A mullah standing atop a wall gave the orders, and an ambivalent crowd of neighbors looked on.
 ''I was utterly shocked,'' he recalled. ''My hands and legs were shaking.'' Afterward, he suffered from nightmares.
 Years later, he would witness public hangings and dismemberments. ''But nothing had the impact of that stoning,'' he said. ''I thought, This can't be Islam.'' 
 At the University of Tehran in the mid-1990s, Mr. Batebi embraced his photojournalism studies and made two dozen short films with existentialist themes, often with his own electric guitar for a soundtrack. He also joined in student protests, getting arrested three times. In fervent late-night discussions, he recalled, one admired model was the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
 The demonstrations exploded in 1999 in what would become known as 18 Tir, the date according to the Iranian calendar. In a wave of protests that threatened the 20-year-old regime, hundreds of students demonstrated against the closing of a newspaper, Salam. Mr. Batebi, busy making his senior thesis film about drug addiction, stumbled upon the demonstrators and joined in.
 When the police fired into a crowd, a bullet hit a young man next to Mr. Batebi, who pulled off the student's shirt to try to stanch the bleeding. After carrying the wounded man to a makeshift clinic, he held up the shirt to warn other students against marching outside. 
 A photographer caught the moment. Mr. Batebi was already in jail when The Economist published his picture, putting him in far greater peril. When the judge hearing his case showed him the magazine, Mr. Batebi reacted with both fear and perverse pride.
 ''At first I was shocked and scared,'' he said. ''But then I thought that even though they're going to kill me, I've caused a major blow to the regime.'' 
 Confined and Tortured
 Mr. Batebi described 17 months in solitary confinement, including repeated torture by interrogators trying to force him to say on television that the famous T-shirt was stained with paint or animal blood.
 His jailers thrashed him with a metal cable, beat his testicles and kicked in his teeth, he said. They held his face down in a pool of excrement. They tied his arms behind his back and hung him from the ceiling. At other times, strapping him to a chair, they kept him awake night after night, cutting him and rubbing salt into the wounds. 
 To stave off madness, he said, he fought back. ''If the interrogator cursed me, I would curse him back,'' he said. ''If the interrogator hit me, I'd try to hit him back.'' 
 Twice he was led blindfolded to the gallows. Once the noose was left around his neck for 45 minutes, and he passed out from fear, he recalled. The second time, he sat, waiting, as a prisoner on each side of him was hanged. 
 The photo that so infuriated the authorities may have saved him, as advocates around the world took up his cause. His death sentence, for ''agitating people to create unrest,'' was commuted, first to 15 years and then to 10.
 In 2005, allowed a day pass to take exams for a sociology degree, he decided to flee. He remained free for five months, working in the political underground and marrying a young dentist. But after she was jailed because of his activities, they agreed to end their union, he said.
 After Mr. Batebi was rearrested in 2006, the harshest treatment stopped. But he was sometimes forced to watch his friends being tormented. Last year, after Mr. Batebi suffered what was probably a stroke and several seizures, he was released for medical treatment.
 In March, he was ordered to return to prison. He knew that supporters wanted him to keep up the fight from behind bars, but he was worn out. ''I couldn't do more than I had,'' he said. ''Everyone needs a life.''
 An Underground Railroad
 On a Yahoo chat site, on March 13, Mr. Batebi contacted Ms. Mazahery, the lawyer, who he knew had helped other Iranians get into the United States. At the same time, through a connection made in prison, Mr. Batebi sought help from the underground Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran, which soon directed him to Argentine Square in Tehran. 
 To his surprise, his Kurdish helpers -- volunteers whose real names he never learned -- said he had to leave immediately, taking advantage of the authorities' lax attention during the Iranian New Year holidays. Carrying only a backpack containing his Dell laptop computer, a camera and a pocket-size video recorder, he retrieved some money from an A.T.M. and climbed into the strangers' car. 
 The next two days were a blur, he said, as he was driven in a series of cars on a circuitous route to the northwestern border with Iraq, a straight-line distance of about 300 miles. Once, his ride was with a family. Another time, it was with a mother and her baby. A third time, he was directed to board a bus.
 With many precautions, the Kurdish underground railroad moved him to the border -- he will not say exactly where. Then a new five-man team took over.
 For a day and a half, with burros carrying supplies, they moved along the border, which was patrolled by guards and protected by land mines. One of the escorts walked ahead to ensure that the way was clear, Mr. Batebi said.
 They heard sniper fire and occasional artillery bombardments, but never came under direct fire. Mr. Batebi's tiny camera captured shaky images of the burros traversing the dry, rocky hills and gullies. Peering over bluffs, the group could see the flags of two nations facing one another at lonely border posts. 
 On March 20, when Mr. Batebi's guides handed him over to new Kurdish guides in Iraq, he said, he felt no elation.
 ''Suddenly I was very scared,'' he said. ''I was like a baby who's been separated from his mother and has stepped into a world of which he knows nothing.''
 A Tense Stop in Iraq
 His protectors brought him to the Erbil offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which began the laborious process necessary to move an Iranian with no passport and little identification to a new land. 
 His Kurdish allies believed that an Iranian hit team was hunting for him, so he was moved from one safe house to another for three months.
 He was shaken one day by the unexpected phone call from the Iranian interrogator, a man known by the prison pseudonym Javad Javadi. Mr. Batebi sought to turn the tables on the interrogator, firing questions back at him and capturing a digital recording of one of the calls, but he knew he had to get out.
 The United Nations was arranging a placement in Sweden when Ms. Mazahery called to say that the United States had granted Mr. Batebi's request for ''humanitarian parole,'' a relatively rare measure used in cases of danger or political importance. 
 An Opposition Icon
 When his flight from Vienna landed at Dulles Airport in Virginia in late June, Mr. Batebi was astonished to see that the airport worker waving the jet into the gate was a Muslim woman wearing a tight head scarf.
 Mr. Batebi was enthralled, sensing a casual tolerance that was exactly what he had longed for in his own country. ''It seems to me that people here are free to live their lives, as long as they do no harm to anyone else,'' he said.
 There are more distinguished figures in the Iranian opposition, people who have spent decades in the struggle, as Mr. Batebi is quick to acknowledge. But he is discovering that few are so recognizable. For the Iranian diaspora, The Economist's 1999 photo remains an iconic image.
 Mr. Batebi was a little nonplussed, Ms. Mazahery said, when an Iranian-American woman outside a Washington grocery store walked past him a few days ago, did a double take and called out his name. When he said that, yes, he was Mr. Batebi, the long-imprisoned dissident, she burst into tears.
 Zahir Janmohamed of Amnesty International USA called Mr. Batebi ''grounded and humble'' about his role. 
 ''As a human rights activist, Batebi's credentials are unquestionable,'' Mr. Janmohamed said. 
 But he warned that now, as Mr. Batebi joins an exile community whose rivalries are legendary, many factions would seek to recruit him. 
 Mr. Batebi speaks of working from afar for peaceful change in Iran. He recoils when asked about the possibility of American military action against Iran, saying that if the United States attacked, ''I might go back and fight for my country myself.'' 
 He has some ordinary goals, the dreams of a man who spent most of his 20s in a prison cell. He wants to study politics and sociology, he said, and work as a photojournalist. He wants to play guitar. He thought for a moment, then he remembered one more modest ambition. 
 ''I want to fish!'' Mr. Batebi said, his face relaxing into a smile. ''I'm going to go fishing!''

 BODY:
In ''No Babies?'' Russell Shorto (June 29) underemphasized the environmental consequences of worldwide population growth and overweighed the fears of regional birth-rate analysts.
 Fear of a work force too small to support pensioners is economically real. Fear of immigration and increasing ethnic and cultural diversity is politically and socially real. But the realities of a widening gap between sustainable world-population levels and growing demands for food, energy, clean air, clean water and arable land overwhelm them.
 I agree that increasing economic opportunities for women and more equal family responsibilities are the preferred means through which we can achieve a decent, sustainable worldwide standard of living. (I would add safe, reliable, affordable contraception.) On the other hand, it would be irrational as a response to the U.S. baby boomers' retirement boom (or increasing European life expectancy) to foster a second baby boom to support the first -- to be followed by a third and a fourth. 
 Constructively and creatively overcoming economic and socio-cultural disruption caused by changing global economics and regional immigration pressures is necessary regardless of specific domestic and regional-ethnic birth rates.
 Finally, it is true that as a species we cannot ''go on forever with a total fertility rate of 1.2'' births per family. But given the current environmental and political pressures resulting from a rapidly expanding world population, a lower birthrate in a few high-consumption developed countries sure wouldn't hurt for a long while.

 Europe's fertility situation is not quite as grim as Shorto suggests. It is technically true that ''birthrates'' are near 1.3 births per woman in Eastern and southern Europe. But this hypothetical indicator gives a distorted estimate of the actual number of births women are having when childbearing is being postponed.The effect of this postponement -- a reduction of about a quarter of one birth -- will disappear over time, thus raising fertility toward the undistorted average of around 1.7 for Europe. New natalist policies to help women combine childbearing and work will quite likely have a modest additional impact. So worries about a depopulation of Europe are exaggerated. The U.N. projects population size to increase by 2050 in northern and Western Europe and to decline by only 3 percent in southern Europe. But Eastern Europe might lose about a quarter of its population.

 Calling the U.S. the ''sparkling exception'' might be a bit more self-congratulatory than is warranted. The social democracy that exists in northern European countries makes for generous government support to families, but also makes for a strong and dominant middle class. Chalking up America's birthrate to a flexible workplace is a simplified view. 
 To truly compare America's birthrate with that of Northern Europe, you will need to take into account a number of socioeconomic factors. What is the birthrate for middle-class Americans who need two incomes and consider higher education a necessity for their children? How many Americans are having more children than they can afford and are living neck-deep in debt and sending their children off to expensive universities so that they can begin their lives in debt as well? 
 Before we pat ourselves on the back claiming to provide in flexibility what northern Europe provides in maternity and paternity leave, subsidized high-quality child care, government stipends with the birth of a child and government supported higher education, let's look a little closer.

 Europe's fertility rates have declined before, but that was usually caused by wars and epidemics. If current rates prevail, Europe could turn into a vast hinterland. It would be tragic if its cultures, as we know them now, disappear.
 RICHARD C. GESCHKE

 Leaving aside, for the moment, the hopefully tongue-in-cheek racism inherent in Shorto's comments about ''waves of Muslim immigrants who couldn't care less about the Acropolis as a majestic representation of Western Culture,'' the suggestion that a declining birthrate in Europe constitutes some kind of global threat is arrogant, xenophobic nonsense. At a time when all are extremely concerned about the catastrophe of global warming, we should be grateful that the human birthrate is declining anywhere. Fewer humans of any ethnicity, religious or cultural heritage is a benefit to all of us.

 It may be a surprise to readers that the American labor market allows more flexible work hours than Europe. For years, we have heard about six-week vacations (while the U.S. employee averages 16.6 days) and long caregiving leaves. Yet when it comes to scheduling working hours, the U.S. does have more flexibility than Europe. 
 We recently compared data from the Fourth European Survey on Working Conditions (2005), covering 31 countries, with data from my organization's 2002-3 National Study of the Changing Workforce. We found that 65 percent of European employees say that their working hours are set by the company with no possibility of change, compared with 39 percent of U.S employees who say they have little or no control over the scheduling of their hours
 Importantly, Shorto differentiates regions of Europe, revealing that the Nordic countries have higher fertility rates. However, he failed to mention something that these countries are doing that we should heed. Not only are they making it easier for mothers and fathers to manage their work and family lives by providing flexibility, they are also investing in the children of these parents by providing better-quality health and primary education, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2007-8. For example, out of 131 economies, Finland ranks 1st, Denmark ranks 3rd, Sweden ranks 5th and the U.S. ranks 34th on this measure. Not only will there be more young people to enter the work force in these countries; they are likely to be healthier and better prepared for work in the 21st century.

HEADLINE: Inflation May Haunt Foreign Bonds, Too

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
BONDS are a haven, less risky than stocks and a comfortable source of income. That has always been the conventional wisdom, at least. And as investors have begun to think more globally, they have looked increasingly to foreign bonds, where the weakening dollar has helped to fuel returns.
 But the world may not be quite as flat as some investors have thought. The outlook for foreign bonds is dimming, some experts say, because the dollar's long decline may slow down or stop. And bonds in general are less attractive when inflation expectations are rising. 
 The days when fund managers could pick the low-hanging fruit may be over. ''International bonds are less attractive because of concerns about inflation,'' said Milton P. Wilkins Jr., a registered adviser at Hammond Associates, a firm in St. Louis that manages money for institutions and high-net-worth individuals. Mr. Wilkins said that the European Central Bank's interest rate hike has put pressure on the value of existing bonds.
 Over the last several years, international and world bond funds have had a healthy run. Some of the best performers, particularly those that don't hedge local currencies, have soared. This year, as a group, they are performing better than many United States bond funds, according to Morningstar. 
 Nevertheless, the tough market these days is putting far more pressure on money managers to find the most attractive bonds, Mr. Wilkins noted. He likes the Templeton Global Bond fund, which has outperformed the Lehman Brothers aggregate bond index over the last one, three and five years. Its largest investments are in South Korea, France and Germany. 
 Michael Binz, a Hammond research analyst, says investors should stick with funds that buy only investment-grade bonds. ''We don't want to take a lot of credit risk,'' he said.
 Not everyone believes that foreign bonds should be part of the average investor's portfolio. These advisers say that the risk is not worth the limited reward and that even the best fund managers cannot add enough value to justify the risk. And they question the rationale of introducing the specter of currency swings and political problems into a portfolio.
 David F. Swensen, who oversees the Yale Endowment, is in that camp. In his book, ''Unconventional Success'' (Free Press, 2005), he argued that hedging the currency risk of foreign bonds is a complex and costly business. Yet unhedged foreign bonds don't offer protection against ''financial crisis or deflation enjoyed by holders of U.S. Treasury securities,'' he said. 
 Given the potential pitfalls, investors who want foreign exposure should do so through investments in developed foreign equity markets, and to a lesser extent in emerging markets, in Mr. Swensen's view. 
 A number of financial advisers, however, say they believe there is some limited room for international funds, particularly if the funds stick with developed nations with stable economies. 
 Financial planners who prefer hedged funds argue that they reduce risk, which is consistent with their overall rationale for investing in bonds. 
 Greg Fernandez, a financial planner and the founder of Nation's Capital Wealth Management, the financial services firm in McLean, Va., takes that view. He favors the Payden & Rygel Global Short Bond fund. The fund invests in bonds of relatively short duration, which should suffer less than longer-duration bonds if interest rates rise. Its expense ratio is 0.61 percent. 
 MR. FERNANDEZ noted that because the expected returns are lower for bond funds than for equity funds, costs are particularly important. His rationale for buying foreign bonds is ''the hope that you are diversifying within the interest rate cycles of other countries,'' he said.
 ''But all that gets eaten away if you are paying high costs for access,'' he added. Lawrence Jones, Morningstar's senior bond fund analyst, says bond funds that invest abroad are generally more costly than domestic funds. For example, in the world bond fund category, the median expense rate for a no-load fund is 0.95, versus 1.14 percent for a front-load fund. That compares to 0.69 percent for a no-load intermediate term domestic bond fund and 0.90 percent for a load fund. 
 He says he believes there is a place for some foreign holdings in a portfolio. ''It is a long-term diversification argument, and anyone who tells you they know what the dollar is going to do is crazy,'' he said. Morningstar gives a high rating to the Pimco Foreign Bond (USD Hedged), a hedged foreign bond fund, and for more risk-oriented investors, it favors the Pimco Foreign Bond (Unhedged). The hedged fund was down 2.74 percent in the second quarter, while the unhedged fund was down 5.3 percent.

HEADLINE: A Second Quarter Tempered by Inflation

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
JUST when the financial system seemed to be recovering and recession fears eased, an old obsession -- inflation -- returned late in the second quarter, erasing all the gains that stocks and bonds had accumulated in the period. It was as though investors had dodged a bullet and then learned they had a chronic, debilitating disease.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended the quarter with a loss of 3.2 percent, done in by a plunge of 8.6 percent in June. That marked a change from the pattern of the previous two quarters, when losses were narrowed by late recoveries.
 Another fresh and unwelcome development was that high-quality bonds were no refuge from shaky stocks. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, which moves inversely from the price, rose sharply, to 3.98 percent from 3.43 percent at the end of March. 
 But many fund investors didn't fare as badly as these numbers indicate. The average bond fund lost less than 0.3 percent, according to Morningstar, and stock funds were down just 0.2 percent, on average.
 In a departure from some recent periods, funds specializing in foreign stocks lagged, with an average loss of 1.6 percent. The average domestic stock fund was up 0.3 percent. Not bad, considering -- but nowhere near what investors might have expected heading into the homestretch. All was going well, or well enough, until the monthly employment report in early June fell short of expectations. That provided a reality check for investors who believed that an economic upturn was at hand.
 The selling accelerated as energy prices kept rising and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, expressed concerns about inflation that were interpreted as having more urgency than earlier remarks. That second whammy seemed to be one too many.
 ''The economy is weaker than was expected at the beginning of the quarter, and inflation is a bigger problem,'' said Mark Schmeer, chief investment officer for global equities at M.F.C. Global Investment Management. ''At the beginning of the quarter, it was not a bad bet to think that the market would recover. Now recovery looks further out.''
 Mr. Schmeer pointed to the lowest consumer confidence readings in a generation and to the string of monthly reports -- which recently reached six -- showing net job losses. ''There are just too many headwinds facing the consumer,'' he said.
 Corporate America could find the breeze a bit stiff and uncomfortable, too, if inflation worsens, suggested Christopher K. McHugh, a portfolio manager at Turner Investment Partners.
 ''We may see a little more of a struggle in earnings for companies that are unable to pass through higher costs,'' Mr. McHugh predicted. ''You can do a price increase once or twice, but if commodity prices continue to rise it's going to have an impact.''
 More investors are coming around to that realization, said Nick Raich, director of equity research at the private client group of National City Bank. Mr. Raich attributes the latest leg of the stock market's decline to a perception that inflation is no longer just looming over the horizon but has actually arrived.
 ''Energy prices over the last few weeks have increased rapidly,'' he said. ''It was just fears before; now it's starting to take hold. The key question is, when is this going to start affecting labor costs? When are workers going to start demanding higher wages to make up for energy costs?''
 As the situation stands, there seems to be no right answer for the economy, businesses or stocks. Rising wages will be inflationary, and until they climb, Mr. Raich said, consumers will compensate for higher energy prices by buying less of other items.
 Amid such a backdrop, it is hard to muster an upbeat prognosis for stocks, but Mr. Raich is fairly hopeful nonetheless. One point in the market's favor, he says, is that the Fed may not be quick to tighten credit.
 ''Our take is that it's just tough talk,'' Mr. Raich said. ''Storm clouds are still there in the mortgage and credit markets, so I don't see how the Fed is going to be able to raise interest rates this summer.''
 As bad as economic conditions have been this year, some investment advisers take heart in the fact that the impact on businesses and stocks hasn't been worse.
 ''With all the things that have been thrown at this economy, it's remarkable how strong it is, that profits are what they are despite all these headlines about inflation, housing, consumer spending,'' said Duncan W. Richardson, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.
 Jerry Jordan, manager of the Jordan Opportunity fund, takes it as a bullish sign that crude oil prices north of $130 a barrel have not sent the stock market any lower than they have.
 ''The stock market is telling me it's dying to go up,'' Mr. Jordan said. 
 Conditions are similar to those in the late 1990s, he said, when the averages were dragged higher by a handful of technology stocks. The heavy lifting today is being done by shares of commodity producers.
 ''The market's going to get narrower and narrower after 12 weeks where everything rallies,'' he predicted. ''Whatever you buy now on a bargain basis will rally, then fall again in the fourth quarter.''
 Action in the second quarter shows that declines, just like rallies, can be narrow -- and that may be another optimistic sign. Of the eight varieties of industry funds tracked by Morningstar, only financials and real estate showed losses.
 The financial sector funds lost money in spectacular style. All 144 of them fell, with an average decline of 14.6 percent. The average real estate fund lost 6.6 percent.
 On the flip side, funds specializing in natural resources rose 21.6 percent in the quarter. Average gains were 7 percent for utility funds, 3.2 percent for precious metals, 3.1 percent for technology, 0.3 percent for communications and 2.4 percent for health care.
 Once the outliers -- commodities and financials -- are removed from consideration, the second quarter seemed almost ordinary. Mr. McHugh noted some of the bright spots.
 ''There are pockets of strength across the board,'' he said. ''Obviously energy has done well, but technology has also done quite well, which is somewhat of a surprise as tech and energy tend to go in opposite directions.'' 
 As for financials, ''even though banks and brokers have been under significant pressure,'' he said, ''property and casualty insurers are doing well.''
 As the third quarter progresses, commodities and financials are still likely to command the most attention from investors. Mr. Raich expects commodities to continue to outperform. But while buying the sector may still be a way to make money, he questions whether it is a way to make sense.
 ''Fund managers will have to wave the white flag and get into commodity stocks because the managers are underperforming their benchmarks so badly,'' he said. ''You start buying these names to have exposure, even though you don't believe in it. That's how the game is played.''
 MR. RAICH remains relatively lightly invested in health care, consumer industries and financials, which has been another way to be ahead in the game this year.
 Mr. Jordan is also steering clear of financials and warning bottom feeders to be careful what they ingest. Financial stocks may have endured nearly all of the decline they are likely to experience, he said, but with the mortgage market in deep freeze, he finds little scope for the stocks to rise.
 Mr. Richardson is willing to take a chance on them before obvious signs of a bottom emerge. By the time it becomes clear to investors that the worst is over in the sector, he explained, much of the recovery may have passed them by.
 ''I would start thinking about putting money into some of these washed-out areas of the market before people start figuring things out,'' he said.
 Mr. Schmeer at M.F.C. applies that same thinking to the market generally. After cataloging the economy's many shortcomings, he pointed out that stocks tend to turn upward before the economy and counseled investors ''not to be bearish at the wrong time.''
 That time could arrive in the next two or three months, he predicted. The slowdown should have lost much of its momentum by then, he said, and fall is often the season when stocks put in their lows for the year.
 When a significant bottom is reached, it is likely to be accompanied by extreme negative readings in sentiment indicators, such as a two-to-one ratio of bears to bulls among investment newsletter editors. Investors should watch for them, Mr. Schmeer advised, then ignore them.
 ''You should jump in with both feet,'' especially into the sectors that have been hit hardest, he said.
 That could require some fortitude, he acknowledged, because the gloom that is gripping the market will mean that ''buying is going to feel very uncomfortable.''

HEADLINE: Money Isn't Everything

BYLINE: By DEBORAH C. WRIGHT; As told to AMY ZIPKIN. 
As told to Amy Zipkin.

 BODY:
I COME from a family of preachers. My grandparents built a church in Bennettsville, S.C. My grandfather died at 54, and my father came home from the Colgate Rochester Divinity School in upstate New York to run the church.
 I was born prematurely and weighed less than three pounds. Blacks had restricted access to hospitals and had to use separate waiting rooms. I needed medical attention, and the main doctor in town was always letting my parents in through the side door to see me. 
 Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, is my aunt on my father's side. When I was 16, she took me to look at colleges. In a small town in the South, race was always an issue. We went to Harvard, and at Radcliffe College I saw that I would be able to focus on my studies. Following the trip with Marian, I had a meeting with my college counselor in Dallas, where my family now lived. She asked if I was considering the University of Houston or Texas Tech. I said, ''I think I want to go to Radcliffe.'' She said, ''I know you're smart, but you're not that smart.''
 I felt sufficiently insecure about getting in that I didn't articulate to my parents how I felt. When the acceptance letter from Radcliffe arrived, my father was not really happy about seeing his little girl go off to Boston. But then he relented and said, ''Well, the whole family is going to be eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.'' My mother asked if I wanted to go. I said yes. She called my dad's mother and Marian, and that settled it. 
 I graduated with a B.A. in 1979 and a joint J.D./M.B.A. degree from Harvard in 1984. I chose a job at First Boston. I assumed I would be the first black woman partner on Wall Street. I would get rich, retire young and do something else. Three years later, there was a crisis in the financial markets. I was laid off, reflecting the economic downturn and that I hadn't found a niche in which I excelled. It was very hard to give up the idea of the first black woman partnership. 
 I went back up to the business school at Harvard to take a bunch of personality tests. I found that while making money was on the list of qualities I valued in a job, it was not at the top. It was a startling revelation. I joined the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit group dedicated to improving the city, and earned $35,000 a year to market Towers on the Park, one of the first new apartment buildings in Harlem in decades. My boss sent me to build a sales office from scratch.
 I hired a dozen people, bought computers, negotiated sales contracts with borrowers and helped arrange mortgages. I was accountable to the developer and the city's housing agency, but also to the community. 
 I was appointed to the City Planning Commission in 1992 by David N. Dinkins, then the mayor, and later became commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development in the Giuliani administration. In 1996, I became president and C.E.O. of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation. My offices were across from the Carver Bank at 125th Street and Lenox Avenue.
 Shortly before I arrived, the bank's new C.E.O. began changing its direction. Over time, it was reeling from losses related to an expansion into new products. 
 Several board members reached out to me in 1999: David Dinkins and other people I'd met in public life. After I arrived at Carver to do a turnaround, I was hit with a proxy battle. A lot of people came to my rescue. Morgan Stanley invested in Carver. Davis Polk & Wardell, where I'd done an internship, defended us pro bono. The guys from the Partnership made deposits. It brought together different parts of my life in an unexpected way. We've turned a profit 27 of the last 28 quarters.

HEADLINE: Long Protected by Washington, Fannie and Freddie Ballooned

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
As the Bush administration scrambles to address the sudden decline of the country's two largest mortgage finance companies, some of their longtime critics say the crisis has been building for years.
 Among them is Jim Leach, a Republican former representative from Iowa, who began arguing two decades ago in Congress that the government-chartered mortgage companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were unfairly insulated from the real world.
 They were not subject to the same financial standards and tax burdens as their competitors, he warned, and if they ran into trouble, an implicit government guarantee to back them up meant taxpayers would be left with the losses.
 ''There are times in public policy making that one can feel like Don Quixote,'' Mr. Leach said of his repeated legislative battles to rein in the two companies' growth. 
 Congress established Fannie Mae during the New Deal to make homes more affordable for lower- and middle-income Americans, and Freddie Mac was established later with a similar purpose. Neither provides home loans. Instead, the companies buy mortgages from banks and take on the risks of possible defaults -- allowing banks to make even more mortgages. 
 Today they own or guarantee about half of the country's $12 trillion in mortgage debt, so the free fall of their share prices last week amid concerns that they were undercapitalized has created chaos for Wall Street and Washington.
 The dominant role Fannie and Freddie play today is no accident. The companies, Wall Street firms, mortgage bankers, real estate agents and Washington lawmakers have built up an unusual and mutually beneficial co-dependency, helped along by robust lobbying efforts and campaign contributions. 
 In Washington, Fannie and Freddie's sprawling lobbying machine hired family and friends of politicians in their efforts to quickly sideline any regulations that might slow their growth or invite greater oversight of their business practices. Indeed, their rapid expansion was, at least in part, the result of such artful lobbying over the years.
 And as Fannie and Freddie grew, so did the fortunes of Wall Street, which reaped rich fees from issuing debt for the two companies, as well as the mortgage and housing industries, which banked billions of dollars as the housing market boomed.
 Even after accounting scandals arose at the two companies a few years ago, attempts to push through stronger oversight were stymied because few politicians, particularly Democrats, wanted to be perceived as hindering the American dream of homeownership for the masses.
 Lots of perks came with Fannie and Freddie's charters and government backing: exemptions from state and federal taxes, relatively meager capital requirements, and an ability to borrow money at rock-bottom rates.
 James A. Johnson, a longtime member of the Washington establishment who previously worked as a campaign adviser to former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, ran Fannie for most of the 1990s. 
 ''Jim Johnson was the architect of Fannie's lobbying strategy. He was the muscle guy, if you will. The guy who would walk the halls of Congress,'' said Bert Ely, a banking consultant in Arlington, Va., and longtime critic of the companies. Freddie, Mr. Ely said, soon copied Fannie's playbook.
 Mr. Johnson could not be reached for comment. Fannie declined to comment; Freddie did not respond to an interview request.
 An early, and for some analysts, seminal attempt to overhaul regulation of Fannie and Freddie occurred in the early 1990s when the country was still licking its wounds from the savings and loan debacle. 
 As legislators debated who would regulate Fannie and Freddie and what sort of capital cushions should be established for the entities, the companies enlisted a bipartisan mix of Washington insiders to represent them. 
 Fannie and Freddie were careful to include powerful Democrats and Republicans as executives, board members and lobbyists to make sure they had access to top government officials and clout on Capitol Hill, no matter which party was in power.
 The strategy that started two decades ago continues. They have hired many officials who have worked for the last two administrations alone. Fannie hired Jamie Gorelick, a former deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration; Thomas E. Donilon, who was that administration's chief of staff to the secretary of state; and Franklin D. Raines, who was President Clinton's budget chief.
 Among Republicans, Fannie hired Robert B. Zoellick, now the head of the World Bank and a former official in both Bush administrations; Stephen Friedman, the onetime top economic adviser to the current President Bush; and Michele Davis, now an assistant secretary of the Treasury under Henry M. Paulson Jr.
 Fannie's board once included Frederic V. Malek, a longtime friend of the Bush family and a former business partner of the current President Bush.
 The outcome of the regulatory tussle in the early 1990s did little to change things. Fannie and Freddie got a new but fairly weak regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, while still having to meet less onerous capital requirements than some lawmakers wanted. The companies also stymied efforts to get the Securities and Exchange Commission more actively involved in regulating them. 
 Later on, Mr. Johnson ramped up the influence of its charitable arm, the Fannie Mae Foundation, by doling out money to thousands of nonprofit groups and similar organizations. (Mr. Johnson was compelled to step down as the head of Senator Barack Obama's vice-presidential search team last month after he was criticized for receiving mortgages on favorable terms from Countrywide Financial.)
 Fannie and Freddie also forged alliances with various interest groups, including affordable-housing advocates that previously criticized the companies for not doing enough for low- and middle-income homeowners. 
 Mr. Leach, the Iowa representative, later accused Fannie and Freddie of effectively buying off activist groups by making charitable contributions to them. By providing much-needed grant money to the nonprofit groups, it made it hard for them to criticize the mortgage titans, said Jonathan GS Koppell, an associate professor at the Yale School of Management. 
 ''Likewise, there were another set of entities, essentially a huge industry, that profits from every additional loan that Fannie or Freddie can buy,'' Mr. Koppell said. ''The more loans they purchase, the more business there is for them and so they're willing to work with the enterprises.''
 Fannie also opened up what it called Partnership Offices. They were billed as regional oversight offices for various housing projects financed by Fannie. In reality, critics, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said they were used primarily to influence Congress by providing local politicians and business leaders with ample ribbon-cutting ceremonies and photo opportunities. 
 The offices were often run by and populated with former Congressional staff members. Several of those offices were staffed by family members of legislators, said Joshua Rosner, an analyst at Graham-Fisher in New York. 
 Of course, foes of Fannie and Freddie began their own lobbying efforts, the most muscular of which had the backing of banks eager to get their own piece of the companies' lucrative mortgage business. 
 Some Wall Street firms joined these efforts, but they typically did not push too hard over fears that Fannie might retaliate by withholding business -- and the rich fees associated with it.
 From 1990 to 2000, as each company's stock grew more than 500 percent and top executives earned tens of millions of dollars, much criticism appeared on opinion pages of newspapers, in reports by free-market research groups and in Congressional testimony. Much of it was sponsored by a loose coalition of Washington lobbyists and consultants who were paid to portray Fannie and Freddie as too big and risky. 
 Ultimately, what most hurt the companies was the failure of home buyers to pay off subprime and other risky mortgages that were packaged into bonds and sold to investors by Wall Street banks like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Citigroup, with Fannie and Freddie playing a lesser role. But they are suffering from the reverberations of the foreclosure wave, as the value of their mortgage assets declines along with home prices everywhere.
 Supporters of Fannie and Freddie say the companies' lobbying machines have largely been taken apart in the wake of the accounting scandals, which resulted in billions of dollars of financial restatements and the ouster of major executives. Fannie's Partnership Offices have been closed and its charitable foundation shut down. 
 Critics say that current housing legislation before Congress could give even more power to Fannie and Freddie by allowing them to venture into new mortgage-related businesses. That, they say, is evidence enough that the companies have not been fully defanged. 
 At the same time, the Senate version of that legislation, which was passed overwhelmingly on Friday, would also create an independent regulator to oversee Fannie and Freddie.
 ''For sure, the political machine has not been dismantled,'' said Thomas H. Stanton, a finance professor at Johns Hopkins University. ''For every interest that might lose if Fannie and Freddie expands into what it does, you have someone else who wants to do business with them.''

HEADLINE: A Bad Start Has Not Deflated The Dream

BYLINE: By MIKE TIERNEY

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
The expansion Atlanta Dream had gone 0-17 in a summer of bummers. The team's venerable coach, who loathes wearing outfits after they are stained by defeat, was running out of ensembles. The players, desperate for a shift in fortune, were changing hairdos. The director of entertainment, whose duties included planning the first victory celebration, was identifying it in code to deflate the pressure on everyone.
 On July 5, the Dream was losing, 19-6, to visiting Chicago, the W.N.B.A.'s second-sorriest team, but Atlanta's loyal fans were shrieking and pounding ThunderStix. A crew hired for the third straight game to blast streamers out of air cannons at the final horn to toast a win was close to packing up and heading home.
 But an upbeat vibe prevailed during a Dream timeout -- a consequence of youth (only two players are beyond their third W.N.B.A. season) and inner calm (spirituality permeates this roster like perhaps few others in professional sports). 
 Two hours later: 91-84, Dream. The cannons fired as part of Operation Cobra, the covert party designation from Sarah Davis.
 Atlanta had finally broken free from a path of failure blazed by expansion rogues from established men's leagues: 
 The N.F.L.'s Tampa Bay Buccaneers, whose 26 straight losses spanned nearly two seasons (1976-77) and whose coach, John McKay, when asked about the team's execution, said, ''I'm in favor of it.'' 
 The N.B.A.'s Miami Heat, which opened 0-17 in 1988 and whose trainer, seeking anonymity for players, told a fellow hotel guest they were a group of heating and air-conditioning repair specialists who needed no ladders to reach ducts.
 The '62 Mets, whose 0-9 start and 40-120 finish established them as modern-day models for bad baseball.
 As confetti floated down on the players, their relief was evident as they high-fived front-row spectators and hurled T-shirts into outstretched arms. Coach Marynell Meadors frolicked about in a pantsuit she could now wear again. Guard Tamera Young unleashed screams of joy, shaking the retro-college pigtails that had replaced her standard ponytail a week earlier. Players who had grumbled before the game about having to wear orange wristbands in conjunction with a charity promotion no longer wanted to remove them. 
 ''I had forgotten what winning felt like,'' guard Betty Lennox said.
 No matter the sport, the hiring process for newborn franchises should include tests for patience. In the Dream's case, it welcomed no starters from established teams, which froze six players each in the expansion draft in 2008. The club had to negotiate hard to get the fourth pick in the 2008 college draft.
 ''You cannot take a short-term view,'' Bill Bolen, the team's president and chief executive, said.
 Meadors was brought on board partly because she had endured W.N.B.A. start-ups as a coach with the Charlotte Sting and director of scouting for the Miami Sol. Prospective players were screened for character. Bolen said a spiritual foundation was not a factor in roster selection, but many of the players said prayer sustained them during the drought, which set a record for W.N.B.A. futility when the losing streak reached 14 games.
 ''I hate to get all religion on you, but I try to have faith in whatever he has planned for me,'' forward Jennifer Lacy said.
 The franchise was incubated by the self-proclaimed Circle of Friends, prominent Atlanta political and business leaders. All are women, and many lobbied for female ownership and management. Early male contributors were called mascots.
 But the buyer turned out to be Ron Terwilliger, the chairman and chief executive of Trammell Crow Residential, for about $10 million. The Dream set sail when the nation's economy had slowed, yet opened with two sellouts, with capacity at 18,729-seat Philips Arena limited to 10,000. Its average attendance, defined by the league as tickets distributed, is 8,176, fifth among 14 teams.
 In a search for fans, the club has left no stone unturned. Players swing by youth basketball camps and battered women shelters. They marched in a Gay Pride parade. Bolen introduced a Cheaper by the Gallon promotion of $4 tickets to select games.
 Although results are mixed, he said, ''I couldn't ask for better fan support.''
 On the court, the results have not been mixed. Twelve players have started; only Lennox has started every game. Meadors has employed so many frontline combinations, ''I lost count at seven or eight,'' she said.
 Kristen Mann, recently traded to Indiana, remembered crying with others after losses. There were in-your-face spats. Meadors moaned to reporters about a lack of aggression and put the starters on notice.
 But spirits were never broken. Not even in the 16th loss, when the Dream scored its first basket against Houston nine minutes in. The reserves, who stood supportively each game until the initial field goal, nearly developed leg cramps while waiting.
 An unanticipated bonus of the player's everyday salaries and the owner's business as a condominium developer is that nearly all the players are neighbors in the same complex. While sharing meals or watching episodes of ''The Bachelorette'' together, they can commiserate. And bond.
 ''I've never been part of a team with this type of chemistry,'' center Katie Feenstra said.
 Center Alison Bales, traded for Mann, noticed it instantly. ''They've done a good job of staying positive,'' she said.
 She had all of seven hours to gather those impressions, having arrived the day of the victory.
 The coaches hurriedly designed 10 plays for Bales, then used her for 18 minutes. ''They called one I didn't know,'' she said. ''I looked at the point guard, 'What do you want me to do?' She motioned me to come set a screen, so I did.''
 In Indianapolis, with emotions conflicted over being traded to a playoff contender, Mann followed the closing minutes of the victory on a computer in the Fever's locker room. She later text-messaged congratulations.
 ''They've got a lot of heart,'' said Mann, who left a piece of hers in Atlanta.
 Four days later, the Dream kicked off a six-game trip with a win against the Lynx in Minnesota. The coaches there wore those orange wristbands again. Whatever works.
 But the charm wore out by Friday night, and the Dream (2-18) fell to the San Antonio Silver Stars, 82-74, and back into the losing column.

HEADLINE: Small Hauler Crosses the Line

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

DATELINE: NEWPORT, Vt. 

 BODY:
 FOLLOWING the curves and dips of Lake Road in the 2009 Subaru Forester it is hard to imagine what it must have been like on this two-lane in the 1920s, trying to outrun the feds in a big Cadillac weighed down by cases of Canadian booze.
 The road led from a store just inside Quebec that sold liquor, across the border (now marked by stern-looking warning signs) south along Lake Memphremagog. 
 The chases must have been something. Even now the road's whimsical ups, downs and arounds require attention when driven quickly. Crashes were common along here, according to ''Rumrunners & Revenuers: Prohibition in Vermont,'' by Scott Wheeler (New England Press, 2002), who wrote that the smugglers did not rely on driving skills alone.
 One tactic was bovine interference. The smuggler would pay a local farmer to be waiting to move his cows across the road just after the booze-laden car roared by. Another trick was a 1920s cloaking device: the driver would pull a lever that poured oil on the hot exhaust to generate a thick smoke cloud.
 When it comes to disappearing acts, this year Subaru rivals the most clever rumrunners. Presto! The easily recognized little Forester wagon is gone. The 2009 version is larger and has more of a generic crossover appearance. Now it looks like everything but the Forester.
 One thing that did not change is that all Foresters (which are imported from Japan) still have an all-wheel drive system, the excellence of which is praised in the mountains of New England. 
 In addition, the new Forester has about an inch more ground clearance (8.7 or 8.9 inches depending on the model). That reduces the chance of being high-centered in deep snow or during the gloppiest part of the mud season, known elsewhere as spring.
 Prices begin at $20,660 for a 2.5X with a five-speed manual transmission and 170-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine. The least expensive version of the 224-horsepower turbocharged model is the 2.5XT, at $26,860. The most expensive Forester is the 2.5XT Limited, which is $28,860.
 The model that I tested for a week was the 2.5X Limited with the 170-horsepower engine and automatic transmission. It had a base price of $26,660, but the optional navigation system ($1,800) brought the total to $28,460.
 Even the base model comes with a long list of standard equipment and all the important safety features. That includes electronic stability control (to help prevent skids); antilock brakes; air curtains (which cover the side windows to provide head protection); seat-mounted side-impact air bags up front (to offer chest protection) and ''active'' head restraints intended to prevent neck injuries in a rear-impact crash.
 The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has given the 2009 Forester its ultimate accolade. The redesigned Subaru gets a Top Safety Pick label for its performance in front, side and rear-impact crash tests and its standard electronic stability control.
 The model I tried had the huge and delightful ''panoramic'' sunroof. The windows are also large, providing wonderful all-around visibility, even when backing up. That gives the Forester such an open feeling that even claustrophobes should fine it calming.
 That sense of bigness is not an illusion. At 179.5 inches, the overall length is almost three inches longer than before -- and comparable with the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. Some cleverpackaging means a big improvement (4.3 inches) in legroom for the second row, which is suitable for two adults. 
 With 33.5 cubic feet of cargo room behind the second row, the olden-day bootleggers would have found plenty of space for their goods. If you fold down the split second row there is 68.3 cubic feet -- more than in the old Forester but a bit less than Honda and Toyota can claim.
 But when it comes to evading revenuers, the older Forester would have been a better choice. The feel of the steering was better, an important reason why the old Forester was fun to drive. The brake pedal is now a bit soft, too. 
 Nevertheless the Forester is well-behaved, predictable and pleasant. It doesn't feel overly nose-heavy, a problem with many all-wheel-drive vehicles. But under only modestly hard cornering there is a lot of body lean. That's not a deadly sin, but it does not encourage brisk driving.
 The reason for that lean is that Subaru wanted to have a comfortable ride. Even on some nasty pavement in Vermont, the ride was impressively comfortable.
 Power comes from either of two versions of a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder. Subaru rates the base engine at 170 horsepower and the turbocharged version (for which premium fuel is recommended) at 224.
 On the nonturbo models there is a choice of a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic, the automatic being a $1,000 or $1,200 option depending on the trim level. The exception is the 2.5X Limited, on which the automatic is standard. 
 On turbocharged models the four-speed automatic is the only transmission. (A five-speed manual used to be offered with the turbo, but it was discontinued because so few were sold.)
 The model I tried had the four-speed automatic. That is one gear less than Honda offers on the CR-V and Toyota provides with the 6-cylinder RAV4. The Forester's nonturbo engine has enough power at low engine speeds that the performance is acceptable. Unfortunately, on mountain roads the transmission had a tendency toward indecision, switching often between third and fourth gears. A five-speed automatic could improve both the fuel economy and the response to the gas pedal.
 The 170-horsepower Forester -- with either manual or automatic -- is rated at 20 miles a gallon in the city and 26 on the highway by the Environmental Protection Agency. In 333 miles of law-abiding two-lane cruising (virtuous, am I not?) I averaged 27 m.p.g. 
 With the turbocharged engine, the E.P.A. rating drops to 19 m.p.g. city and 24 m.p.g. highway. 
 Over all, the Forester is more practical and safer than ever. For a relatively small vehicle, its ride is superb and it is an accommodating and pleasant servant. But the play and pluck of the old Forester is greatly diminished. Wouldn't it have been lovely to have it all?
 INSIDE TRACK More features, more room, less fun.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Steps Into Mortgage Crisis

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
BECAUSE of the vagaries of federal banking regulations, states have somewhat limited ability to respond to the mortgage foreclosure crisis, but this has not stopped Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York from acting aggressively in recent months. 
 Still, it is not clear whether his actions will survive federal scrutiny, and whether borrower protections he seeks will ultimately increase the cost of mortgages.
 Mr. Cuomo wields unusually broad power in the mortgage industry because many lenders and ancillary businesses are based in New York or do business there, and therefore come under his jurisdiction. That, analysts said, has helped Mr. Cuomo essentially circumvent a federal regulatory setup that prevents states from regulating nationally chartered lenders.
 Earlier this year, for instance, Mr. Cuomo struck an agreement with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two federally supported companies based in Washington that buy mortgages from lenders and then package the loans into so-called pools that are resold to investors. Under the agreement, they cannot buy a mortgage from a lender unless the home has been evaluated by an independent appraiser -- not, as has often been the case, affiliated with the lender or broker.
 Such an arm's length appraisal, Mr. Cuomo has said, prevents lenders from inflating a home's value and pushing borrowers into loans they cannot afford.
 Mortgage brokers say this new protocol, which is to take effect in January, will lead some borrowers to pay for multiple appraisals if they switch lenders, as sometimes happens when interest rates quickly drop during the loan-shopping process. Appraisals typically cost around $300, but can cost more for unusual properties that defy easy comparison.
 ''This is definitely going to cost borrowers money,'' said Richard L. Tracy Jr., a board member of the Connecticut Society of Mortgage Brokers. He said the agreement would force brokers to accept whatever appraisal firm is chosen by the lender, minimizing the chances that the same appraiser could evaluate the same property during what is basically the same transaction.
 An official in Mr. Cuomo's office declined to comment, but Howard Glaser, a principal of the Glaser Group, a Washington-based mortgage industry consultancy, said lenders could, in fact, accept an appraisal that was completed on behalf of a different lender, as long as it met the second lender's standards. 
 A representative of Acorn, a New Orleans-based activist group that advocates on behalf of low- and moderate-income people, said borrowers would benefit from the policy change.
 ''An accurate appraisal is good for homeowners,'' said Austin King, national director of Acorn's Financial Justice Center. ''Too many times, people have gotten financing for $150,000 when the house was only worth $100,000, and it's ruined them.''
 Indeed, anecdotal evidence suggests borrowers are already on the alert for suspect appraisals as home values slump, with some buyers refusing to buy unless their offer is no more than the appraised value.
 Mr. Cuomo's appraisal agreement represents a de facto regulation of national banks, which must comply with the agreement or lose their primary market for loans. Partly for that reason, some federal banking regulators -- primarily the Office of Thrift Supervision -- are seeking to exempt federally chartered banks from the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agreement. Industry executives expect to know within months whether the federal regulators will prevail.

HEADLINE: The Man Who Dared to Question Ethanol

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
IT wasn't too long ago that a loose coalition of anti-ethanol forces was bemoaning the futility of its fight.
 After failing to block huge new ethanol mandates in the Senate last December, Jay Truitt, until recently the chief lobbyist for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, complained about the ''fervor'' and ''spirituality'' that surrounded ethanol on Capitol Hill.
 ''You can't get anyone to consider that there is a consequence to these actions,'' he said, adding, ''We think there will be a day when people ask, 'Why in the world did we do this?' '' 
 That day has arrived sooner than Mr. Truitt, or most anyone else, anticipated.
 Of course, much of the turnabout is attributable to relentless price increases at the grocery store that have caused many people to argue that the land used to grow corn for ethanol should be used for food instead.
 But the changing perceptions about ethanol have been helped along by the most unlikely of characters, a bearded and mild-mannered economist with a dry sense of humor and an encyclopedic knowledge of the arcana of American farm policy.
 Until January, Keith Collins was the longtime and widely respected chief economist for the Department of Agriculture. In that position, he was a frequent booster of government policies that encouraged biofuel production.
 In the months after his departure, he was hired by Kraft Foods Global to analyze the impact of biofuels on food prices. He delivered a stunning, and unexpected, roundhouse to his former employers. 
 The Bush administration had said biofuels were a minor factor in rising food costs. In a May 1 press conference, Edward P. Lazear, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said, ''The bottom line is that we think that ethanol accounts for somewhere between 2 and 3 percent of the overall increase in global food prices.''
 A month later, in Rome at a United Nations conference on the food crisis, the agriculture secretary, Ed Schafer, echoed Mr. Lazear's analysis in defending American biofuels policy.
 But Mr. Collins pointed out that the administration's analysis was more like a back-of-the-envelope calculation, and that it hadn't accounted for the impact of biofuels on crops other than corn. The push for ethanol has led farmers to grow more corn and less of other food crops, one factor in rising prices for commodities like wheat.
 Based on his own analysis, Mr. Collins maintains that biofuels have caused 23 to 35 percent of the increases in food costs. (The ethanol lobby dismissed Mr. Collins's analysis as a ''Krafty use of corn demand data.'')
 ''I looked at a little bit more recent period,'' said Mr. Collins, who appears uncomfortable in his role as a hired gun and treads carefully so as not to insult his former employer. ''I was looking at a period when corn going into ethanol was rising much faster than what they looked at.''
 His move to Kraft came amid an aggressive effort by the Grocery Manufacturers Association to change perceptions about ethanol while food prices were high. The association hired the Glover Park Group, a politically wired public relations firm in Washington, to help it develop a more effective strategy. Scott Faber, lobbyist for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, declined to comment. 
 The Glover Park Group wrote in its proposal to the association, ''We must obliterate whatever intellectual justification might still exist for corn-based ethanol among policy elites.'' 
 It also recommended identifying and recruiting ''third-party validators.''
 Mr. Collins said he didn't believe his hiring was part of an anti-ethanol campaign. Instead, he said, he was simply asked by Kraft Foods for his thoughts on biofuels' impact, and he ultimately wrote those up in a 34-page paper.
 He also notes, correctly, that the turnabout in the ethanol debate has a lot more to do with relentless price increases than with P.R. strategists and his remarks.
 ''High prices are the dominant factor,'' Mr. Collins said. ''Without that, this coalition would not have gotten the legs they have gotten.''
 Nonetheless, his criticism of the administration's analysis was closely followed by a more thorough analysis from the Department of Agriculture. In comments made before a Senate subcommittee last month, Joseph Glauber, Mr. Collins's successor, said the impact of biofuels on food prices was actually closer to 10 percent; the previous analysis had neglected to consider biofuels' impact on soybeans, he said.
 In an interview, Mr. Glauber said his analysis simply looked at a broader set of assumptions than the earlier one by the administration; for instance, he included the impact of soybean-based biofuels on food prices. While saying he might ''quibble'' with some of Mr. Collins's assumptions, he said the analyses were similar.
 ''It just goes to show people have different ways of portraying these numbers,'' he said. ''I don't think these analyses are all that different.''
 EVEN so, Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, has asked the U.S.D.A. inspector general to investigate why such an error was made and perpetuated. ''It is unfortunate that two high-ranking officials from the same agency have made such incompatible fact-based statements,'' Mr. Flake wrote in a June 26 letter to the inspector general, adding that the U.S.D.A. ''must be able to produce and disseminate clear and accurate information, particularly when it pertains to the culpability of U.S. policy in skyrocketing food prices.''
 Mr. Collins said his remarks did not contradict his work at the Agriculture Department. Back then, he said, he never anticipated that corn would hit $7 a bushel.
 ''We expected stronger prices for corn,'' he said. ''If we got the prices we anticipated -- high s$3 -- everybody would be happy. Ethanol would be cruising along just fine.''

HEADLINE: An Actor Winning Praise, And Pursuing an M.B.A.

BYLINE: By TAMMY LA GORCE

DATELINE: GREAT NECK 

 BODY:
 THE casting call on the Backstage Web site was for a Chinese actor who spoke Mandarin. Charles Jang met one of the requirements, and fudged the other. 
 ''I speak Mandarin. But I'm not Chinese. I'm Korean,'' Mr. Jang said. ''I figured I'd show up and not say anything.'' It was only after he was told he got the part in the recently released, critically lauded independent film ''Take Out'' that he came clean with the directors, Sean Baker and Shih-Ching Tsou, about his ethnicity.
 When Mr. Jang, now 28, accepted the lead role in the film in 2004, he was a student at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan whose flash of screen time as Peter Parker's classmate in the blockbuster film ''Spiderman'' was the top entry on his acting resume. 
 He was also suffering from a case of artistic self-doubt that eventually led him down his current path: In addition to acting, Mr. Jang works full time in marketing at Google's New York City headquarters in Manhattan and is studying for his M.B.A. at New York University. 
 He plans to keep his day job, he says, unless a steady stream of acting parts comes along -- which he does not expect. ''There's still not a large supply of roles for Asian actors,'' he said in the living room of the home here that he shares with his mother, Young Hee Jang, a nurse, and father, Howard Jang, a retired engineer. 
 In the end, the critics said, it wasn't Mr. Jang's Mandarin that made ''Take Out'' a critical success -- Nathan Lee, in his review in The New York Times, called it a ''scrupulous and socially conscious slice of life,'' and The New Yorker called it ''remarkable'' and ''richly authentic'' -- but the power of the simple story and his acting. 
 Made for $3,000, ''Take Out,'' which opened in June in Manhattan and earlier this month at Roslyn Cinemas in Roslyn, is about an immigrant Chinese deliveryman who is given a single day to repay $800 to the thugs who smuggled him into the country. It follows Mr. Jang's character, Ming Ding, a bicycle deliveryman on Manhattan's Upper West Side, as he hands off wontons and lo mein to customers who form a broad spectrum of economics and human compassion. Sometimes he pedals through driving rain; at one point, his bike gets a flat tire. 
 ''I had the great privilege of studying the lifestyle of a bunch of these types of illegal immigrants before we made the movie,'' Mr. Jang said. ''I spent time with eight grown men living in a small apartment together on very humble salaries. It made me appreciate my life so much more -- I look around now and say, 'Hey, life is not too bad.' '' 
 Growing up in Great Neck, he said, it never was. Born in Middlesex, N.J., he moved to Long Island with his parents as a toddler, and because his neighborhood has long been significantly Asian, Mr. Jang felt particularly at ease. In fact, it was his desire to get closer to his Chinese neighbors in Great Neck that led him to study Mandarin in Taiwan in 2000.
 ''My Chinese friends were always laughing, and I wanted to get in on the joke, broaden my cultural horizons,'' Mr. Jang said.
 It is that kind of attitude -- a contagious spirit of curiosity and enthusiasm -- that is at the heart of what Mr. Jang's co-workers might call his ''googlyness.'' 
 ''Around the office, we have this adjective, it's called 'googly.' It's sort of a description of how well rounded you are, how you might fit into the Google culture. 
 ''To be googly, you bring good work experience and a good education. But you also bring something extra,'' Mr. Jang said. ''You could be a marathon runner, or you could be an ex-marine. Maybe being a movie actor makes you googly, too.''

HEADLINE: Fewer Flights to America's Playgrounds

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS and Orlando, two of the biggest leisure-travel destinations in the country, are both feeling growing twinges of apprehension. And it has nothing to do with an imminent roll of the dice or a plunge on a thrill ride.
 Both places are facing alarming reductions in commercial air service as airlines whack away at markets where fares are traditionally cheap. According to OAG, the airline-schedule data company, the number of flights scheduled for this fall is down nearly 13 percent for both Las Vegas and Orlando, versus the same period last year. Additionally, US Airways has said it plans to reduce its Las Vegas service by 20 percent this fall. 
 Joe Brancatelli, publisher of the subscription travel Web site Joesentme.com and a close observer of the airline business for over two decades, said the tourist businesses in Las Vegas and Orlando were ''very, very worried'' about disappearing flights and scrambling for solutions.
 M. Ponder Harrison, managing director for marketing at the low-fare carrier Allegiant Air, based in Las Vegas, said: ''What you're seeing in Las Vegas and other leisure markets like Orlando is a kind of mild panic setting in, because all of a sudden airline seats are evaporating.'' In June, Allegiant reported a jaw-dropping load factor -- the number of seats occupied -- of 94 percent. Most major carriers had a load factor of about 80 percent in June. 
 Allegiant, whose routes link destinations like Las Vegas, Orlando and Phoenix with about 50 smaller cities, is buying six MD-80 planes to add to its fleet of 36 MD-80s, most of which are configured in a single class with 125 seats. 
 Six more planes, with just over 700 seats, won't make much of a dent in the looming air-service crisis for Las Vegas and Orlando. But Allegiant has been a pioneer in a type of travel packaging that could help ease the problem -- and that some tourism officials are hoping to develop themselves, on a bigger scale.
 In recent years, Allegiant has entered into packaging deals with hotels and casinos, rental car companies and attractions like Las Vegas shows and Orlando-area theme parks. These packages effectively subsidize low fares. Last year, Allegiant sold 395,000 hotel rooms as part of packages for its customers.
 Allegiant also uses four airplanes exclusively for charter flights on behalf of the Harrah's casino company.
 Given that commercial airlines, facing continued high oil prices and deteriorating finances, are likely to cut even more capacity from budget-travel leisure markets, local subsidizing of some air service becomes a reasonable proposition, Mr. Brancatelli suggested.
 There's precedent. In 1999, Harrah's and the Rio casino in Las Vegas each invested $15 million to help start a low-fare carrier, National Airlines, to add more seat capacity into Las Vegas from the East Coast. (National went out of business in 2002.)
 With airlines parking hundreds of unwanted aircraft, he said, ''there are an awful lot of airplanes sitting around and available to someone who is thinking about maybe running charter flights in partnerships with specific destinations.'' 
 In Orlando, local business and tourism executives recently started a working group called Air Team Orlando to develop models for addressing the looming problems. Gary Sain, president of the Orlando/Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau, said that ''we're working with airlines more aggressively than ever before'' on ideas like packaging airfares, hotels and theme park attractions to entice more travelers, at least on existing flights. They are also working with foreign airlines, he said.
 SO far, domestic and international tourism in Orlando has held up despite rising fares and a souring economy, Mr. Sain said. But ''there is no question as we get into the fall we're going to see a decrease in seating capacity,'' he said. ''People are skittish right now.'' 
 Future indicators for leisure travel look bad, at least for the next six or nine months.
 Last week, PKF Hospitality Research released an analysis saying that already-known air-service cutbacks could cause a drop in lodging demand greater than what was experienced by travel tourism after 9/11.
 Las Vegas, Orlando and Phoenix are ''more susceptible'' than other major destinations to the cutbacks because of their reliance on cheap tickets and long-haul flights, said Mark Woodworth, president of PKF.
 ''There's something happening within the airline industry that we simply have not seen before,'' he said.

HEADLINE: ESPN, Now a Behemoth, Still at Home in Tiny Bristol

BYLINE: By CYNTHIA WOLFE BOYNTON

DATELINE: BRISTOL 

 BODY:
 THIRTY years ago, this sleepy town in the woods of central Connecticut was best known as having been the clock-making capital of the country during the Industrial Age. When that industry fell by the wayside, the town became a leader in the manufacturing of bicycle bells. But nothing put Bristol on the map more than William Rasmussen's decision to broadcast New England Whalers and University of Connecticut games throughout the state. 
 Rasmussen, a former spokesman for the Whalers hockey team in Hartford, found out that buying a 24-hour nationwide feed was cheaper than buying blocks of evening time to transmit just around the state, and he founded a sports entertainment network that has transformed the world of sports, and tiny Bristol along with it.
 In September 1979, the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network launched television's first daily sports news program, ''SportsCenter.'' Today, it is a mainstay of the network, as well as television's longest-running sports show, and ''SportsCenter'' is seen by more than 94 million viewers each month. Matt Zuckerman, an insurance salesman from Milford, is one of them. ''I'm addicted,'' said Mr. Zuckerman, 56. 
 Indeed, the 5,100 hours or so of live and original sports programming that ESPN airs worldwide each year has changed both sports and sports viewing. A division of ABC Inc., ESPN has also been a boon to Bristol and its population of about 60,000.
 The skyline here is now defined by the 31 giant satellite dishes that transmit sports news and trivia from ESPN's campus headquarters.
 ''You can't really appreciate ESPN, and all those dishes, until you've driven through Bristol and seen them,'' said Peggy McGowan, 55, of nearby Ansonia. ''But let's just say they're pretty impressive. You can't help but be wowed by the power this local business has to reach out to the world.''
 ESPN has been a good native son to Bristol. The behemoth doesn't shy away from the fact that it is based in a place decidedly less glamorous than Los Angeles or New York, the hubs of most other networks. One ESPN commercial before the Super Bowl featured ''Bristol University,'' where fans would come to learn about sports.
 On the popular ''SportsCenter,'' anchors have been known to make references to ''bucolic Bristol.''
 Mayor Arthur Ward said that last year, the sports network paid the city more than $245 million in real-estate and personal-property taxes -- six times the amount paid by Bristol's second-biggest taxpayer, Covanta Bristol, a waste-to-energy producer.
 ''ESPN is a success story we can all celebrate,'' said Mr. Ward, a city councilman for 14 years before being elected mayor in November. ''Sure, there's the money aspect; ESPN's taxes allow the city to do a lot. But ESPN is more than that. They've been big supporters of the Bristol Boys and Girls Club, helped bring Little League World Series playoffs to our city and are supporting Bristol's efforts to bring other national-interest sports ventures here, like the American Legion World Series, which we recently bid on for 2010.''
 Joe Tonelli, an assistant baseball coach at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, said that ESPN had brought more attention to Connecticut college athletics in the national media. ''Between ESPN and University of Connecticut basketball, our state's developed a real sports flavor,'' Mr. Tonelli, 40, said.
 Though its empire spans the world, about 3,200 of ESPN's 4,500 employees work in Bristol. Some say that because of its out-of-the-way locale, ESPN generally attracts younger job applicants than networks in major cities.
 Its youthful hires help the network maintain the breezy, ultra-hip style that is its trademark. But youth alone is not enough. All entry-level applicants for jobs as production assistants, reporters and unpaid interns must first pass a sports trivia test that has become well-known in the sports journalism industry, said Fred Brown, director of talent negotiation and production recruitment.
 ''We want people who are real sports geeks,'' Mr. Brown, 57, said. ''We can teach people TV production, but we can't teach sports knowledge or that real love for sports.''
 According to Mr. Brown, being a ''sports geek'' means having an in-depth knowledge of the network's four ''meat-and-potatoes sports'': baseball, football, hockey and basketball. It doesn't hurt to know Nascar, golf, tennis or extreme sports like snowboarding and BMX biking, he added.
 But those who have followed only local sports, and specialize in them, need not apply, he said. 
 ''What's key is a knowledge of sports on the national level. That means if you grew up on the East Coast, it's not enough to know every bit of trivia about the Boston Red Sox. You also need to be able to talk to me about the San Diego Padres,'' Mr. Brown said. 
 ''And just like in a game, you get one shot to score. You don't want to freeze under pressure.''
 For potential newsroom researchers, the timed, 40-question written exam includes not only sports history and trivia but also word problems that require calculating win percentages, statistics and box scores, as well as making graphics. Those trying to break in as interns or production assistants take an oral quiz that Mr. Brown generally changes for each applicant.
 ''I have some favorite questions, like, 'Name the last five Heisman Trophy winners,' '' he said. ''One kid was able to tell me 20, and I wanted to hire him on the spot. He gave me the same 'wow' we want every ESPN viewer to feel.''
 Jamie Thom, 30, is a production assistant who creates the topic bars that scroll across the screen during programs. ''Whatever the stress of going through the application process and taking the quiz -- it's so worth it,'' said Ms. Thom, a Southington resident. ''I mean, I get paid for watching baseball. Work couldn't be much better than that.''
 Katie Sharp of Plainville felt fairly confident applying for a job as a studio production researcher last year. Her resume included a bachelor's degree in economics and a master's degree in sports business, and as a lifelong ''fan of everything,'' she knew her sports.
 Then came the quiz.
 ''I hadn't been that nervous since my SATs,'' said Ms. Sharp, 29, adding that the toughest part was being asked to create basketball line scores. ''Working for ESPN has always been my dream, so failing the quiz just wasn't an option; though I understand why they do it. Our viewers expect a lot. Everyone who contributes to every broadcast needs to be able to think quickly, creatively and accurately.''
 It's not just fans who rely on the network for their information. Players, coaches and others in the industry also pay attention to ESPN. ''I make a lot of my playing decisions based on the stats,'' said Tommy John, 64, the former major league pitcher who is in his second year as manager of the independent Bridgeport Bluefish.
 Al Jaffe, vice president of talent negotiation and production recruitment, developed the quiz in 1988. He said that he preferred to think of it as more of a sports conversation than a test. He's also baffled by the anxiety the quiz causes, and the attention it receives.
 ''It's good business; good journalism,'' said Mr. Jaffe, 61. ''If you want to work for the Food Network, you probably need to know how to make creme brulee. To work here, you need to know sports.''

HEADLINE: Long-Term Fix Is Elusive In Medicare Payments

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Congress has voted to block a cut in Medicare payments to doctors but has done nothing to solve the fundamental problem that caused the cut, and the issue will come back to haunt the next president and the next Congress, lawmakers and health policy experts say.
 Democrats and Republicans agree that the formula for paying doctors is broken, but fixing it would be phenomenally expensive, they say. So Congress provides temporary relief from year to year, the same way it takes care of the Alternative Minimum Tax, which snares more middle-income families every year. 
 Older Americans are directly affected because they pay higher premiums when Medicare spends more on doctors. 
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts made a surprise return to the Senate last week and helped Democrats pass a bill to rescind a 10.6 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors. The White House says President Bush will veto the bill because it would also reduce subsidies paid to insurance companies that care for some Medicare beneficiaries.
 Democratic leaders believe they have the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. The bill was passed 355 to 59 in the House, and the crucial vote in the Senate was 69 to 30.
 The bill would give doctors an 18-month reprieve. But it leaves in place the current system of paying doctors, based on a fee schedule that sets payment rates for 7,000 different services. 
 ''The physician payment mechanism is hands down the most broken part of Medicare,'' said Gail R. Wilensky, who was administrator of the Medicare agency under the first President Bush. ''We desperately need a new way to reimburse doctors. I fear that the need for fundamental change will be kicked down the road once the latest crisis has passed.''
 Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, agreed. ''We must find a long-term solution,'' he said. 
 Mr. Rockefeller and other lawmakers are pleading with physicians' groups to come forward with a comprehensive proposal. But that could be difficult because any new formula would almost surely produce winners and losers among doctors.
 Dr. Thomas R. Russell, executive director of the American College of Surgeons, said, ''We absolutely want to work with Congress to get this fixed in the next 18 months.''
 ''Doctors who are responsible for the rapid growth in certain areas, like testing and imaging procedures, need to bring those expenses under control,'' Dr. Russell said.
 But radiologists say it is unfair to hold them accountable for all the growth in imaging services because the services are usually ordered by other doctors, like orthopedic surgeons and internists.
 Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, called the current formula severely flawed. She said it cut payments to doctors about 5 percent in 2002 and would have caused cuts every year since then if Congress had not intervened.
 Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said, ''Congress needs to step up with a permanent solution, not the kind of shameful temporary patches and fixes that require physicians to come hat in hand to Congress every 6 or 12 or 18 months.''
 The fee schedule places a limit on payment for each service, from a routine office visit to brain surgery, but does not limit the volume or quantity of services. Medicare officials set payment rates each year, using a complex formula that sets overall goals for spending on doctors' services. 
 When actual spending exceeds the goals, payments to doctors are supposed to be reduced. If Congress steps in to block a cut in one year, Medicare recoups the money by making deeper cuts in future years. Under the bill passed by Congress last week, doctors would face a cut of more than 20 percent in 2010.
 The purpose of the formula is to control the growth of Medicare spending for doctors' services. But individual doctors are not rewarded or penalized for their own performance.
 Medicare provides the same annual update to doctors, regardless of whether they control costs and keep their patients healthy or provide poor care and perform unnecessary tests.
 The Medicare formula, established by Congress in 1997, links spending on doctors to growth of the economy, measured by the gross domestic product. This formula works when the economy is booming, doctors say, but people need their services just as much in a recession.
 The formula does not distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate increases in services billed to Medicare. Nor does it reflect the fact that many services can be done with new technology in doctors' offices, rather than at hospitals.
 Dr. Wilensky said that instead of paying for ''little bitty units of service,'' Medicare should provide a bundled payment to a doctor or group of doctors who care for patients with chronic illnesses like diabetes and congestive heart failure.
 Many doctors want to eliminate the payment formula. They say their costs -- for malpractice insurance, staff salaries and other expenses -- are rising faster than Medicare payment rates.
 But the Congressional Budget Office says if Congress repealed the formula and allowed payments to doctors to grow by the rate of medical inflation, the costs could be substantial: $65 billion in the first five years and nearly $200 billion in the next five years.

HEADLINE: Powerful Foes Threaten Colombia Trade Deal That Bush Says Has Something for All

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
To President Bush, the free-trade deal his administration negotiated with Colombia has something for everyone. 
 If approved by Congress, it would open a new market for American produce and manufactured goods. Unlike other trade deals, it would not threaten American jobs, because imports from Colombia are already coming in nearly duty-free. 
 And it would have the added benefit of shoring up a respected ally, President Alvaro Uribe, who has made progress in taming the narcotics traffickers, right-wing death squads and left-wing guerrillas that had almost made Colombia a failed state.
 In recent months, nearly 100 newspapers in the United States have endorsed the Colombia trade agreement. So have many top Democrats, including Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago. And Mr. Uribe, who was already popular in Congress, was widely lionized after the dramatic rescue of hostages in Colombia on July 2. 
 Yet the trade agreement remains a long shot, because of opposition by American labor unions, Democratic leaders in Congress and Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. 
 ''I am not optimistic that the Congress will have an opportunity to review the bill this year, unless something unforeseen or dramatic occurs by the administration,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. ''I don't think they handled this correctly.''
 As the price for approval of the Colombia deal, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker and a California Democrat, demands specifically that the administration expand programs for American workers. She blocked the agreement from coming to a vote in April, infuriating Mr. Bush. 
 Her aides have not set a specific price, but some Democrats say it would have to be at least $30 billion for items such as worker training, children's health programs, unemployment benefits and expenditures on roads, bridges and infrastructure. 
 Some Democrats say a deal could emerge in the closing weeks of Congress this fall, perhaps in discussions over a new package to stimulate the economy.
 Within the administration, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, and Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, are believed by Democrats and some Republicans to be more receptive to that sort of deal than is the White House, which is trying to limit spending.
 The White House and Senate Democrats have made some progress on negotiating an agreement on spending for ''trade adjustment assistance'' for workers who have lost jobs because of imports or outsourcing to other countries. But for now, each side accuses the other of bad faith in refusing to negotiate on other programs for workers. 
 What Mr. Bush has done instead is wage one of his most elaborate campaigns for a measure in Congress since he took office in 2001, winning newspaper endorsements from the broadest political spectrum. 
 Also, since August, at least 55 members of Congress, including two Democrats from the Senate and 25 from the House, have traveled to Colombia, in trips usually led by an indefatigable cheerleader for the trade pact, either Ms. Schwab or the commerce secretary, Carlos M. Gutierrez. 
 The White House says Mr. Bush has called for passage of the deal 40 times, and Ms. Schwab and other cabinet members have given 145 speeches on it.
 In addition, the administration has lined up the support of Democratic mayors and members of the Clinton administration, and obtained endorsements from trade associations with ties to Democrats, including those for the movie, music and consumer electronics industries. 
 Democrats acknowledge that perhaps a third of their members of Congress are ready to support the deal, but only if the leadership wins more concessions on other legislation relating to jobs. 
 In May, Mr. Bush stood before a tractor and a Harley-Davidson motorcycle on the White House South Lawn and said that 40 percent of United States growth last year resulted from exports. ''That motorcycle right there,'' he said, would be $4,000 less expensive in Colombia because of the deal.
 ''There will be no diminution of how cool one is when they drive a Harley,'' the president said, to laughter. ''But it's going to be easier for somebody to buy it.'' 
 By itself, trade with Colombia represents barely 1 percent of total United States trade volume. Imports from Colombia totaled $9.4 billion in 2007, mostly oil, spices, coffee and tea. Exports, of machinery, chemicals, plastics, corn and other goods, were $8.6 billion. But the symbolism of the trade is enormous.
 Opposition to the Colombia deal is not rooted in organized labor's fear of lost jobs, the issue behind unions' opposition to past trade deals like Nafta. Rather, it is over the killings of labor advocates in more than two decades of Colombia's long civil wars.
 According to the National Labor School, a research organization in Colombia, more than 2,500 union members have been killed since 1985, with fewer than 100 cases resulting in convictions. 
 Since Mr. Uribe took office in 2002, the number of killings of union members has dropped sharply, though labor leaders have noted that killings are up this year from 2007. Mr. Uribe's government has also made progress in quelling the left-wing insurgency, as reflected by the recent hostage rescue.
 Senator John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, tried early this month to help his own campaign and its advocacy of free trade with a visit to Mr. Uribe's presidential palace in Cartagena, where he hailed the Colombian leader as a champion of the war on terrorism. 
 But that trip prompted a rebuke from John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has said that approving the deal would in effect be rewarding the increase in anti-labor violence and the failure to arrest many people responsible for killings. 
 Labor officials dismiss the idea that the hostage rescue, in which three Americans were among those freed, should resuscitate the Colombia trade pact.
 ''I don't understand why people are even raising the hostage issue,'' said Thea M. Lee, public policy director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''The concerns are about workers and conditions of workers in Colombia.''
 An official from the Colombian government, asking not to be identified because of embassy rules, said that if an agreement were reached on ''trade adjustment assistance'' for workers affected by imports, as seems likely, that would improve the prospects of the trade pact.
 ''There are a lot of Democrats who recognize the economic sense of the agreement,'' this official said, adding that the hostage rescue showed ''that the military that Colombia has today is different from the one of six years ago.''
 But administration officials concede that it will be difficult for Democratic lawmakers to defy the wishes of organized labor in a presidential election year. 
 ''All I can tell them is that politics is too strong right now,'' Mr. Bush said in one of his trade speeches. ''But I also haven't given up hope.''

HEADLINE: Emily Kropp, Christopher Michel

 BODY:
Emily Lauren Kropp, the daughter of Joann Y. Kropp and Norman W. Kropp of Upper Grandview, N.Y., was married on Saturday evening to Christopher George Michel, the son of Linda L. Michel and Edward G. Michel of Dublin, Calif. The Rev. John Caulfield, a Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington. 
 The bride, 27, is a public affairs specialist at the Commerce Department in Washington, writing press releases and acting as a liaison with the public affairs offices of the Census Bureau, the Economics and Statistics Administration and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. She graduated magna cum laude from George Washington. 
 Her father is a senior counsel at Citigroup in New York, specializing in employee benefits law. Until 2007, her mother was the president of Walter Karl in Pearl River, N.Y., a direct-marketing division of InfoUSA, a business data company; she is now a freelance direct-marketing consultant. 
 The bridegroom, 26, is the deputy chief speechwriter to President George W. Bush. He graduated summa cum laude from Yale, where he was editor in chief of The Yale Daily News.
 His mother teaches preschool at the Resurrection Lutheran Child Development Program in Dublin. His father works in San Francisco as the regional controller for financial operations of the Seattle, Las Vegas and San Francisco offices of Flack & Kurtz, a New York engineering consulting firm. 
 Ms. Kropp and Mr. Michel met in June 2003 while working 12- to 14-hour days at the White House. She was doing research and fact-checking for presidential speeches, and he had just started as an intern. By August, he had joined the staff as an assistant, doing fact-checking, research and writing. 
 By October, they were having late-night dinners together, usually at places that served pizza or hamburgers, because little else was open. 
 ''We really didn't talk much about politics,'' Ms. Kropp said. ''We had enough politics at the office. So we talked about friends and family.''
 ''Like Chris, my job will end in January,'' she added. ''But we'll be together.''

HEADLINE: What if the Candidates Pandered to Economists?

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard. He was an adviser to President Bush and advised Mitt Romney in his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

 BODY:
IN the months to come, John McCain and Barack Obama will be vying for the support of various voting blocs. It is safe to say, however, that one group won't get much attention: economists. 
 The American Economic Association represents only a small fraction of 1 percent of the electorate. In every election season, we economists expect to be largely ignored, and, unlike many of our other forecasts, that one often turns out to be right.
 But suppose it were otherwise. Imagine that those running for office tailored their economic positions to attract the experts in the field. What would it take to put the nation's economists solidly behind a candidate? 
 On many issues, from universal health insurance to increased taxes on the rich, economists do not speak with a single voice. But on some issues we do. Here is an eight-plank platform designed to attract a majority of economists. It is based on discussions I have had with my colleagues -- call them focus groups, if you'd like -- and polls of my profession:
 SUPPORT FREE TRADE Economists are nearly unanimous in their support of an unfettered system of world trade. Here, Senator Obama lags behind Senator McCain. Senator Obama's bad-mouthing of Nafta and his opposition to free-trade pacts with Colombia and South Korea make most economists cringe. 
 Many economists would go even further than Senator McCain has suggested by, for example, repealing antidumping laws. The ostensible purpose of these laws is to prevent foreign companies from selling in the United States at prices below fair value, but the law's notion of ''fair'' rarely makes sense. In practice, these laws are little more than an excuse for special interests to shield themselves from competition.
 OPPOSE FARM SUBSIDIES Economists like free markets, a principle that applies to agriculture as much as any good or service. Again, Senator McCain has the lead. Senator Obama's endorsement of the recent $300 billion farm bill, his support for domestic ethanol subsidies and his opposition to imported sugar ethanol may bring votes from farmers, but economists view these policies as a burden on taxpayers and consumers. 
 LEAVE OIL COMPANIES AND SPECULATORS ALONE With the stunning rise in oil prices, both presidential candidates have been tempted to demonize market participants. Senator McCain has complained about the ''obscene profits'' of oil companies and called for a ''thorough and complete investigation of speculators.'' By contrast, most economists see nothing more sinister than the forces of global supply and demand at work. There is little benefit, and potentially much harm, in the candidates' populist finger-pointing.
 TAX THE USE OF ENERGY Senator Obama wins a point by opposing a summer gas tax holiday, a McCain proposal that economists greeted with derision. Most economists advocate increased taxes on energy products. The recent response of consumers to higher gas prices -- including the increased use of mass transit and greater purchases of small cars, scooters, and even bicycles -- demonstrates that the price mechanism is the most reliable way to reduce energy consumption and to curtail a variety of driving-related problems.
 RAISE THE RETIREMENT AGE Like both presidential candidates, most economists recognize that Social Security faces a long-term problem. Senator Obama says he wants to fix it by extending the payroll tax to high incomes. Senator McCain opposes tax increases and wants the Social Security system to include personal accounts, but he has avoided proposing specific benefit cuts needed to make the numbers add up. 
 Some economists endorse Senator Obama's tax hike, and some endorse Senator McCain's personal accounts, but a much greater number would increase the age of eligibility for benefits. As Americans live longer, we need to redefine old age -- a theme that should resonate with Mr. McCain, who is 71.
 INVITE MORE SKILLED IMMIGRANTS As part of their embrace of globalization, economists are more open to immigration than is the general public. Admittedly, unskilled immigrants raise some potential problems: They may depress wages for Americans at the bottom of the economic ladder, exacerbating the rise in inequality, and they may overburden the social safety net. By contrast, skilled immigrants promote economic growth, especially among poorer Americans, and pay more in taxes than they get in government benefits. The more, the merrier. 
 On this issue, economists very clearly practice what they preach. Many of the best economists at top American universities were born abroad.
 LIBERALIZE DRUG POLICY Many economists marry their support of economic freedom with a similar support of personal freedom. Drug policy is a case in point. A 2006 poll of professional economists asked whether the United States should legalize marijuana. Those in favor outnumbered those opposed more than three to one.
 RAISE FUNDS FOR ECONOMIC RESEARCH The government subsidizes economic research through an arm of the National Science Foundation. The amount of money is relatively small -- measured in the millions, not billions -- and spending has been about flat in inflation-adjusted terms over the last decade. If Senator McCain or Senator Obama wants to endear himself to economists, there is no easier way than by promising an extra few million dollars to improve our understanding of how the economy works.
 You might view this policy as nothing more than a way to buy a few votes. Perhaps you view economists as mere mortals, as tempted as anyone else by special interests. Maybe you would regard more funding for economic research as not very different from the billions thrown every year at farmers. 
 If you are that cynical, I won't try to dissuade you.

HEADLINE: Obama Supporters on the Far Left Cry Foul

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY; Dan Frosch contributed reporting from Denver, Andrew Tangel from New York and Katie Zezima from Boston.

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. 

 BODY:
In the breathless weeks before the Oregon presidential primary in May, Martha Shade did what thousands of other people here did: she registered as a Democrat so she could vote for Senator Barack Obama.
 Now, however, after critics have accused Mr. Obama of shifting positions on issues like the war in Iraq, the Bush administration's program of wiretapping without warrants, gun control and the death penalty -- all in what some view as a shameless play to a general election audience -- Ms. Shade said she planned to switch back to the Green Party.
 ''I'm disgusted with him,'' said Ms. Shade, an artist. ''I can't even listen to him anymore. He had such an opportunity, but all this 'audacity of hope' stuff, it's blah, blah, blah. For all the independents he's going to gain, he's going to lose a lot of progressives.'' 
 Of course, that depends on how you define progressives. 
 As Ms. Shade herself noted, while alarm may be spreading among some Obama supporters, whether left-wing bloggers or purists holding Mr. Obama's feet to the fire on one issue or another, the reaction among others has been less than outrage. 
 For all the idealism and talk of transformation that Mr. Obama has brought to the Democratic Party -- he managed to draw a crowd of more than 70,000 here in May -- there is also a wide streak of pragmatism, even among many grass-roots activists, in a party long vexed by factionalism.
 ''We're frustrated by it, but we understand,'' said Mollie Ruskin, 22, who grew up in Baltimore and is spending the summer here as a fellow with Politicorps, a program run by the Bus Project, a local nonprofit that trains young people to campaign for progressive candidates. ''He's doing it so he can get into office and do the things he believes in.''
 Nate Gulley, 23, who grew up in Cleveland and is also here as a Politicorps fellow, said too much was being made of Mr. Obama's every move.
 ''It's important not to get swept up in 'Is Obama posturing?' '' Mr. Gulley said. ''It's self-evident that he's a different kind of candidate.''
 Bob Fertik, president of Democrats.com, a progressive Web site, started asking his readers last month to pledge money to an escrow fund for Mr. Obama, as opposed to contributing to him outright. The idea was to make Mr. Obama rethink his decision to support the Bush administration's wiretapping measure. 
 Mr. Obama initially said he would try to filibuster a vote, but on Wednesday he was among 69 senators who voted for the measure, which to many liberals represents a flagrant abuse of privacy rights. The legislation grants legal immunity to telecommunications companies that cooperated with the wiretapping program.
 So far, 675 people have pledged $101,375 to Mr. Fertik's escrow fund, money that theoretically would be donated to Mr. Obama once he showed a firm commitment to progressive values, Mr. Fertik said. 
 But Mr. Fertik also said that while Mr. Obama's change on the spying issue upset some supporters, it was not necessarily emblematic of a troubling shift to the center. He said he continued to support the senator, though he added, ''We don't see the need to close our eyes and hold our noses until November.''
 Still, others warned that Mr. Obama risked being viewed as someone who parses positions without taking a principled stand.
 ''I'm not saying we're there yet, but that's the danger,'' said David Sirota, a liberal political analyst and author. ''I don't think there's disillusion. I think there's an education process that takes place, and that's a good thing. He is a transformative politician, but he is still a politician.'' 
 Joe McCraw, 27, a video engineer from San Carlos, Calif., who writes three liberal blogs, said Mr. Obama's shift on the domestic spying measure was a watershed moment.
 ''This is the first time I've ever seen him lie to us, and it makes me feel disappointed,'' Mr. McCraw said. ''I thought he was going to stand up there, stand by his campaign promises like he said he would, and it turns out he's another politician.''
 Many Obama supporters said the most vocal complaining about various policy positions was largely relegated to liberal bloggers and people who might otherwise support Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, or Dennis J. Kucinich, the liberal Ohio congressman who dropped out of the presidential race earlier this year. 
 ''I think it's accentuated by the fact that Obama's appeal is an appeal to idealism,'' said Kari Chisholm, who runs a blog, blueoregon.com, and does Internet strategy for Democratic candidates. ''They believe their ideology is the only idealism and Obama's is very mainstream. I'm not surprised they're getting a little cranky. They've always been kind of cranky. A mainstream Democrat has always been too mainstream for them.''
 Some of Mr. Obama's supporters say he is less vulnerable to accusations of flip-flopping on issues because his campaign ultimately has been built on his biography and philosophy.
 ''I don't think the test on him is in an explicitly narrow set of check boxes that have to get filled,'' said Kevin Looper, executive director of Our Oregon, a liberal advocacy group. ''I think it's about do his campaign and his message embody serious changes for the direction of the country?''
 Mr. Looper and many other supporters said Mr. Obama was solid on core Democratic concerns like the environment, social and economic justice and how to balance taxes among economic groups. Of course, his stands on more specific issues appeal to many supporters, too.
 Rhys Warburton, a 25-year-old Brooklyn resident who teaches earth science at a public high school, said he supported Mr. Obama because he thought the senator was more likely to end the Iraq war. If Mr. Obama takes a few steps to the center that will not change his opinion, he said, and ''it doesn't make the others any better or more attractive to vote for.''
 Before the Oregon primary in May, Mr. Obama held a rally here in Portland that made news not for what the senator said but for what he saw: more than 70,000 people came to hear him speak on a bright Sunday along the Willamette River.
 The startling size of the crowd, followed by Mr. Obama's resounding win here on May 20, helped cement his status as the presumptive nominee. And for some, even far beyond Oregon, it confirmed what Mr. Obama had been telling voters from the start: that he really is different.
 ''Seventy-five thousand people do not attend political rallies unless something truly magical is happening,'' Bob Blanchard wrote on May 18 in the comment section accompanying an account of the rally on The New York Times's Web site. ''Our great country will soon close the book on 'government by division,' and embrace 'government by inclusion.' ''
 Asked last week whether Mr. Obama's vote on the surveillance law or any other recent statements or actions had altered how he felt about the candidate, Mr. Blanchard, of North Smithfield, R.I., said ''absolutely not.'' 
 ''When are these people going to go, anyway?'' Mr. Blanchard said of left-wing critics he believes have hurt Democrats in past elections. ''My attitude is lighten up on the guy. We want to win. Moving to the center is not a crime in this country.''
 Ms. Shade, the Green-turned-Democrat-returned-Green voter, spoke about Mr. Obama while leaning out her second-floor apartment window, where she has placed homemade signs urging the impeachment of President Bush. Others say ''Free Gaza'' and ''Occupation is Terrorism.'' She said twice that the American political system was ''rotten.'' 
 ''You realize,'' Ms. Shade said, her voice fading with resignation, ''that you're talking to somebody who's pretty far out of the mainstream.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 15, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about some left-wing voters' dissatisfaction with Senator Barack Obama misstated the political affiliation of Ralph Nader, who is also seeking the presidency. Mr. Nader is running as an independent; he is not the candidate of the Green Party, which nominated Cynthia McKinney on Saturday.

HEADLINE: It Takes A School, Not Missiles

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Since 9/11, Westerners have tried two approaches to fight terrorism in Pakistan, President Bush's and Greg Mortenson's. 
 Mr. Bush has focused on military force and provided more than $10 billion -- an extraordinary sum in the foreign-aid world -- to the highly unpopular government of President Pervez Musharraf. This approach has failed: the backlash has radicalized Pakistan's tribal areas so that they now nurture terrorists in ways that they never did before 9/11.
 Mr. Mortenson, a frumpy, genial man from Montana, takes a diametrically opposite approach, and he has spent less than one-ten-thousandth as much as the Bush administration. He builds schools in isolated parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan, working closely with Muslim clerics and even praying with them at times. 
 The only thing that Mr. Mortenson blows up are boulders that fall onto remote roads and block access to his schools. 
 Mr. Mortenson has become a legend in the region, his picture sometimes dangling like a talisman from rearview mirrors, and his work has struck a chord in America as well. His superb book about his schools, ''Three Cups of Tea,'' came out in 2006 and initially wasn't reviewed by most major newspapers. Yet propelled by word of mouth, the book became a publishing sensation: it has spent the last 74 weeks on the paperback best-seller list, regularly in the No. 1 spot.
 Now Mr. Mortenson is fending off several dozen film offers. ''My concern is that a movie might endanger the well-being of our students,'' he explains.
 Mr. Mortenson found his calling in 1993 after he failed in an attempt to climb K2, a Himalayan peak, and stumbled weakly into a poor Muslim village. The peasants nursed him back to health, and he promised to repay them by building the village a school.
 Scrounging the money was a nightmare -- his 580 fund-raising letters to prominent people generated one check, from Tom Brokaw -- and Mr. Mortenson ended up selling his beloved climbing equipment and car. But when the school was built, he kept going. Now his aid group, the Central Asia Institute, has 74 schools in operation. His focus is educating girls.
 To get a school, villagers must provide the land and the labor to assure a local ''buy-in,'' and so far the Taliban have not bothered his schools. One anti-American mob rampaged through Baharak, Afghanistan, attacking aid groups -- but stopped at the school that local people had just built with Mr. Mortenson. ''This is our school,'' the mob leaders decided, and they left it intact.
 Mr. Mortenson has had setbacks, including being kidnapped for eight days in Pakistan's wild Waziristan region. It would be naive to think that a few dozen schools will turn the tide in Afghanistan or Pakistan.
 Still, he notes that the Taliban recruits the poor and illiterate, and he also argues that when women are educated they are more likely to restrain their sons. Five of his teachers are former Taliban, and he says it was their mothers who persuaded them to leave the Taliban; that is one reason he is passionate about educating girls. 
 So I have this fantasy: Suppose that the United States focused less on blowing things up in Pakistan's tribal areas and more on working through local aid groups to build schools, simultaneously cutting tariffs on Pakistani and Afghan manufactured exports. There would be no immediate payback, but a better-educated and more economically vibrant Pakistan would probably be more resistant to extremism.
 ''Schools are a much more effective bang for the buck than missiles or chasing some Taliban around the country,'' says Mr. Mortenson, who is an Army veteran.
 Each Tomahawk missile that the United States fires in Afghanistan costs at least $500,000. That's enough for local aid groups to build more than 20 schools, and in the long run those schools probably do more to destroy the Taliban.
 The Pentagon, which has a much better appreciation for the limits of military power than the Bush administration as a whole, placed large orders for ''Three Cups of Tea'' and invited Mr. Mortenson to speak.
 ''I am convinced that the long-term solution to terrorism in general, and Afghanistan specifically, is education,'' Lt. Col. Christopher Kolenda, who works on the Afghan front lines, said in an e-mail in which he raved about Mr. Mortenson's work. ''The conflict here will not be won with bombs but with books. ... The thirst for education here is palpable.''
 Military force is essential in Afghanistan to combat the Taliban. But over time, in Pakistan and Afghanistan alike, the best tonic against militant fundamentalism will be education and economic opportunity. 
 So a lone Montanan staying at the cheapest guest houses has done more to advance U.S. interests in the region than the entire military and foreign policy apparatus of the Bush administration.

HEADLINE: Will Little Havana Go Blue?

BYLINE: By DAVID RIEFF. 
David Rieff, a contributing writer for the magazine, is the author, most recently, of ''Swimming in a Sea of Death: A Son's Memoir.'' His book ''The Exile: Cuba in the Heart of Miami'' was published in 1993.

 BODY:
On the surface, political life in Cuban Miami seems unchanged. Little Havana is still partly a Disney version of a displaced Cuba and partly a genuine community hub, where families who have long since left for suburbia still come for nostalgic weekend lunches. At the Versailles Restaurant, the community newspapers preaching no compromise with Castro are all that are on offer. For almost four decades, the Versailles has been an obligatory stop for Washington politicians courting the Cuban-American community, visits that, as photographs in the restaurant attest, have often involved putting on a white guayabera, the four-pocket dress shirt that often replaces a coat and tie in the Caribbean. This familiar theater of intransigence -- a staple of South Florida life at least since the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, when C.I.A.-backed Cuban exiles tried to overthrow the new Communist regime -- is ubiquitous. 
Some Cuban-Americans point hopefully to a softening in the Spanish-language, Cuba-focused radio outlets that now dominate the South Florida market. But for an outsider, what is striking is the degree to which the hard-line stance endures, since it might have been supposed that 50 years of failure to influence events on the island might have led to the conclusion that the hard-line position needed to be reconsidered. Most officeholders in Florida and, for that matter, most national politicians continue to at least pay lip service to the dream of a post-Communist Cuba, even though, early this year, Fidel Castro succeeded in seamlessly handing over power to his brother Raul -- testimony, if any was needed, to the stability of the regime. 
 Yet if Cuban Miami does indeed continue to dream, it is also beginning, quietly, tentatively and painfully, to adjust. Backstage, something very new is happening. Call it the Miami Spring, or Cuban-American glasnost. This community that has clung for decades to its certainties -- about the island itself, about the role the exile community would play after the Castro brothers passed from the scene, about where Cuban-Americans should situate themselves in terms of U.S. domestic politics -- is in ferment. This matters not only in terms of the destiny of the Cuban-American community itself but also in terms of the 2008 elections since, despite claims made on background by some of Barack Obama's advisers, Florida is likely to play a pivotal role in determining whether Obama or John McCain becomes president, and the Cuban-American vote is likely to play its usual outsize role in deciding which candidate prevails in the state. 
 In the past, both Democratic and Republican contenders tried to conform to the hard-line expectations they perceived as the overwhelming consensus within the Cuban-American community. But Obama has recently strayed from orthodoxy by criticizing aspects of the American embargo on Cuba and asserting that he is prepared to open talks with the regime. This might seem like a golden opportunity for McCain to solidify his hold on the Cuban-American vote, but Obama's views appear to be resonating in Cuban Miami more than anyone could have predicted. Two Democratic Congressional candidates in the Miami area -- Joe Garcia and Raul Martinez -- were added last month to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's list of potential ''red to blue'' conversions, bringing to 37 the number of seats nationally that the Democrats hope to flip away from the Republicans. For the first time, the hard-line consensus is being challenged. There is real debate in Cuban Miami these days about the embargo, above all about the series of further restrictions that were imposed by the Bush administration in 2003 and 2004. These limited travel for so-called people-to-people educational exchanges, abolished the category of ''fully hosted'' travel (under which travel to and from Cuba was underwritten by non-U.S. citizens and which Washington long suspected of being a scheme for money-laundering), reduced family visits to once every three years and limited the sending of money from Cubans or Cuban-Americans living in the United States to the sender's immediate family -- parents, siblings, children -- rather than, as before, to his or her extended family. A decade ago, support for such restrictions and any other confrontational policy was a certainty in Cuban South Florida. So was its domestic corollary: dependable support for Republicans both locally and nationally. Today, and quite suddenly, that unwavering support for Republicans is no longer a given. 
 Even sudden change has roots, and this is true in South Florida. Eduardo Padron, the president of Miami Dade College and himself a Democrat, told me recently: ''This community was always a great deal more politically diverse than it was given credit for. And Cubans have always been more socially liberal than their voting patterns might suggest.'' The architect Raul Rodriguez -- whom I accompanied on a number of family visits to the island in the early 1990s and who has been involved in civic affairs in South Florida for many years -- put it more sharply: ''This community has always been caricatured.'' 
 The community is also more fluid than you might assume. Despite Republican dominance ever since President John F. Kennedy was seen as having betrayed the cause following the Bay of Pigs disaster, Cuban-American Democrats have been able to gain office from time to time. Cesar Odio was Miami's (appointed) city manager; Alex Penelas was mayor of Miami-Dade County during the Elian Gonzalez controversy, in which, over fierce (and bipartisan) protests in Miami, the Clinton administration returned to Cuba a child whose father remained on the island and whose mother tried to take him with her to Florida in a makeshift raft but drowned on the voyage. But while Odio and Penelas were impeccably liberal on domestic issues, their attitudes toward the Castro regime were every bit as confrontational as those of their Republican rivals. Penelas took a leading role supporting those trying to keep Elian in Miami, while Odio was a key political adviser to Jorge Mas Canosa. Mas Canosa's political action committee, the Cuban American National Foundation (CANF), had a reach in Washington in the 1980s and 1990s almost on a par with those of the American Association of Retired Persons or the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
 Until Mas Canosa's death in 1997, ''the Foundation,'' as it is almost universally referred to in Miami, could legitimately be described as the power in the exile community, and Mas Canosa -- it was always difficult to separate the man from the institution -- was the person to whom both Republican and Democratic administrations turned for the seal of approval on all matters related to Cuba policy. But there is little question that while he supported some Democrats and could work with them on local problems, on the national level, Mas Canosa, like his constituency, was strongly Republican. The speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Marco Rubio, is a Republican, as are all three of greater Miami's Congressional representatives -- Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Lincoln Diaz-Balart and his brother, Mario Diaz-Balart -- and one of Florida's two senators, Mel Martinez. And only the most optimistic Democratic political operative would go so far as to claim that Cuban South Florida is likely to eschew John McCain for Barack Obama, any more than it opted for John Kerry or Al Gore over George W. Bush. Senator McCain almost certainly represented the majority view in Cuban Miami when he insisted, in a speech there in May, that to soften the travel restrictions or the limits on remittances ''would send the worst possible signal to Cuba's dictators -- there is no need to undertake fundamental reforms; they can simply wait for a unilateral change in U.S. policy.'' 
 But the fact that the Illinois senator would decide to take the bull by the horns and come out flatly for a less absolutist interpretation of Washington's embargo in a speech before a Cuban-American audience in Miami -- and be received warmly at the foundation by Jorge Mas Canosa's son -- is an emblem of the fact that the Cuban-American vote is in play even on what in exile politics is called el tema: the theme of the exile and of Cuba's future. As Obama put it at the luncheon for him at the foundation: ''I know what an easy thing it is to do for American politicians. Every four years, they come down to Miami, they talk tough, they go back to Washington and nothing changes in Cuba.'' In a direct appeal to Cuban-American voters opposed to the restrictions on travel and remittances, the senator said it was ''time to let Cuban-American money make their families less dependent upon the Castro regime.''
 Whether Obama really expected to make inroads into the Cuban-American vote with the speech is questionable. When Hillary Clinton was still in the race, she was far more circumspect, even if, off the record, her aides expressed views not that dissimilar from those of the liberal Cuban-Americans whom Obama was echoing. But that the presumptive Democratic nominee would think the speech worth making at all, in a community where he is the subject of a great deal of mistrust and hostility and in a state where he is not polling well against Senator McCain, exemplifies the change that is taking place in the Cuban-American community.
 The most significant emblems of this new dispensation in Miami, however, are closer to home. It had long been a commonplace of South Florida politics that greater Miami's three Congressional representatives, Ros-Lehtinen and the Diaz-Balart brothers -- who are descended from a prominent pre-Castro political family -- could basically keep their seats for life, as previous South Florida congressmen like Claude Pepper and Dante Fascell did. But while Ros-Lehtinen is generally regarded as a shoo-in for re-election, the Diaz-Balart brothers are facing the first serious challenges of their careers. Instead of facing off against the comparative unknowns who have been the sacrificial lambs of the Democratic Party in the past in and around Miami, they are facing two extremely well-known (and surprisingly well-financed) Cuban-American Democrats: Raul Martinez, the controversial former mayor of the working-class (and overwhelmingly Cuban-American) city of Hialeah, just northwest of Miami, and a proven vote-getter for many years; and Joe Garcia, from his youth a protege and then a trusted colleague of Jorge Mas Canosa's and, after the older man's death, his successor as head of the Cuban American National Foundation.
 It is a stunning change. As recently as 2004, the Diaz-Balart brothers each won re-election easily. And while in the Democratic tsunami of 2006 their Democratic challengers did somewhat better than expected, no one really thought that genuinely credible opponents like Martinez and Garcia might decide to take on the brothers in 2008. Some people in Cuban Miami say privately that overconfidence led both congressmen to neglect bread-and-butter issues in their districts and not devote enough resources to constituent services. They point out that the third Cuban-American member of the House delegation, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, has constituent services second to none and is far more flexible on social questions than the Diaz-Balarts. (Her district now includes the heavily gay Florida Keys, and she has garnered considerable support there as well.) This, they say, rather than her views about Cuba, is what makes her own re-election such a virtual certainty.
 The problem for the Diaz-Balart brothers is that this time they are facing competitors whose Cuban bona fides are beyond challenge, and who are more in tune with the social liberalism of much of the Cuban-American community. As Joe Garcia put it to me over coffee at the Versailles Restaurant in Little Havana, ''Mario is not going to out-Cuban me, that's one thing you -- and he -- can count on.'' (Mario Diaz-Balart declined to be interviewed for an article in what his press spokesman described as the ''left-wing New York Times,'' asserting that it could not be objective; Lincoln Diaz-Balart simply did not respond to interview requests.) For his part, Raul Martinez points to intimidation of dissident voices in the past. ''There is a fear in this community,'' he said as we sat together in the living room of his home in Hialeah, ''that if you speak out, then bad things will happen. I think that, in particular, businesspeople have been afraid of being denounced on talk radio or not getting contracts because they are too 'controversial.' '' This has now changed, he said, and the change is real, though he added, laughing, ''It's just that no one wanted to be the first person to call for it.''
 Raul Martinez says he believes that Lincoln Diaz-Balart and his supporters will focus on the Cuba issue to the virtual exclusion of all others. ''They have no other issues to discuss,'' he said. ''They have to attack me as objectively pro-Castro.'' Referring to the Miami gossip that Lincoln Diaz-Balart retains political ambitions in Cuba after the fall of the regime, Martinez added: ''I don't want to be president of Cuba. When change comes to the island, I want to be a resource person.'' 
 Martinez was scathing about Lincoln Diaz-Balart's record on constituent service. It seemed clear that as far as he was concerned, the priority should always have been what you could bring back to your district. ''Claude Pepper,'' he said, ''who held this seat for decades, brought back federal money for affordable housing. Lincoln was in Congress when I was mayor of Hialeah. He never brought any bacon home. What I got, I got from other congressmen. What has Lincoln done? As we say in Cuba, he has one song, and he's sticking to it. I want to do what Pepper did, what Dante Fascell did.'' But to achieve this, Martinez conceded, meant challenging the way political dialogue has been structured in the Cuban-American community for decades. He said he sensed it was happening. ''Where people used to worry about being called Communists,'' he told me, ''and that was something that ended the conversation in Miami, now times have changed. What people say to me is not, 'How can you dare take these positions,' but, 'What took you so long?' ''
 This does not mean that Cuban-American voters have become so assimilated into the American mainstream that they will vote pocketbook issues to the exclusion of Cuba-centered ones like the terms of the embargo or the role of the exile community. Both the painful wounds of exile and concern about the future of the island, rekindled now that Raul Castro has settled into power, are never far from the surface in Cuban Miami, even among young people whose politics vis-a-vis Cuba are far less hard-line and confrontational than those of their parents and grandparents. ''Everyone in Miami has been waiting to say that the exile is over,'' Raul Rodriguez told me. ''But as Yogi Berra said, 'It ain't over 'til it's over.' ''
 Just as the struggle between the exiles and the Castro regime was always a civil war in the most basic sense, pitting family member against family member, so the political schism in Miami is a family and often a generational affair. One of Joe Garcia's young staff members, an Obama supporter, Giancarlo Sopo, exemplifies this. His biography is typical of leading families within the exile community. And if Sopo cannot be called representative, he is nonetheless one of a great many of the children and grandchildren of hard-line anti-Castro exiles to have come to believe that not only do things have to change in Cuba, but they have to change in Miami as well.
 Over lunch in Miami Beach, Sopo was at pains to point out both what unites and what divides the generations. ''My father was a Bay of Pigs veteran,'' he told me. ''He was in one of the first infiltration teams to go into Cuba before the landing. Later, he was Jorge Mas's right-hand man at the foundation, a Ronald Reagan supporter to his core.'' Sopo's face hardened and his voice grew quieter: ''My father died in 1999. He died frustrated because his dreams of returning to Cuba never came true. But I don't believe my father died so that my generation could make the same mistakes. There has to be another way.'' 
 For some in the older generation of Cuban exiles, Sopo's ''other way'' is inevitable with the passage of time. As another former foundation stalwart, Cesar Odio, observed grimly, ''The exile will be over by death, with my generation dying out.'' For Odio, young people like Sopo and Odio's own younger son, who is also working for Obama, are typical of what in Miami is often referred to as the fourth generation (though Odio's wife, Marian Prio, the daughter of a former president of Cuba, has been a strong backer of the Illinois senator from early in the campaign). ''If things haven't changed yet,'' he told me, ''they will soon enough. Not only are the historical exiles going away, but increasingly the community is either made up of people who consider themselves to be Americans first or, among the recent arrivals, people who grew up in Castro's Cuba for whom the embargo as currently enforced simply makes no human sense. They, not the intransigents, are the majority now.''
 Odio is certainly not alone in emphasizing the effect on South Florida politics of Cubans who have arrived since the early 1980s. Attitudes have been mutating for many years, particularly among people who have arrived from the island over the past decade and among the generation of young, native-born Cuban-Americans in college or now entering the work force, for whom Cuba is less a cause than a curiosity and, potentially at least, a business opportunity. 
 Both Joe Garcia and Raul Martinez are betting on these recent arrivals to help undermine the hard-liners. For many of the newcomers, Cuba is a place, not a cause; and to the extent they have a cause, it is the relatives they left behind not all that long ago and want to see regularly and help without restriction. Martinez flatly dismissed the idea that the ban on remittances was effective anyway. ''If you go to a local barber,'' he told me by way of illustration, ''and people are reassured that you're not from the F.B.I., they are likely to ask you how, not whether, they can send money to their relatives in Cuba. Everybody down here is doing it!''
 Such rhetoric is part of Martinez's argument for why voters should choose him over Lincoln Diaz-Balart. But when he talks about voters asking him indignantly, ''The government's going to tell me I can't go see my family more than once every three years or send them money?'' -- or insists that anti-Castro intransigence has become ''a business'' for a Cuban-American establishment unwilling ''to lose its franchise'' -- he is identifying a hunger for change that he maintains is widespread within the community.
 Martinez's fellow insurgent candidate, Joe Garcia, is convinced that the times have changed already. He does not repudiate the anti-Castro activism of Mas Canosa. Indeed, in conversation he speaks proudly both of Mas Canosa and of his own connection to him. But he claims that his own message of change is getting a hearing even among older, more hard-line voters. ''Many of them,'' he told me, ''know just as well as I do that new times demand new solutions. I can speak with authority about the ways we tried in the past. I played a role in shaping them, after all. But I think if Jorge Mas were alive today, he would see that the world has changed and that we Cuban exiles, and Cuban-Americans, we have to change, too.''
 When I told Cesar Odio what Garcia had said, he smiled, though whether more out of amusement or bitterness was hard to say. ''Look,'' he told me flatly, ''we tried intransigence, and it got us nothing in terms of actually affecting what took place on the island for all those years. It will be half a century next year since Castro seized power! Do you realize that? And when Castro turned over power to his brother, what effect did we in the exile have? The answer, unfortunately, is none whatsoever.'' After a pause, he added, ''And even if someone could promise us that we would be more effective at some point in the future, he has to face the fact that the commitments of people of my generation -- people born in Cuba -- are not the same as those of our children and grandchildren.'' Anyone who spends much time with young Cuban-Americans in South Florida can vouch for the accuracy of this. As Odio put it, ''The fourth generation of Cuban-Americans, born here of people born here, are not exiles; they're Americans. Cuba is important to them, but it's not everything to them, the way it is still to this day to many people in my generation.''
 Whether this means a change in the monopoly on power that hard-line Cuban-Americans have maintained pretty much since they began to gain serious political power in the 1970s is another question. On the two key questions -- whether pocketbook concerns will trump exile politics in the 2008 election cycle, and whether there is now enough opposition to the ban on remittances and the limitations on travel -- the jury is still out, and will be until the fall elections decide the matter. After all, Democrats have won in Miami-Dade County (that is, greater Miami) before. John Kerry carried the city in 2004. But no one suggests that he did so with Cuban-American votes or that his victory represented any great shift in the community's attitudes. Even if the Democratic victories are as widespread in November as the consensus among political consultants and pundits suggests, the electoral math may still not add up for Cuban-American Democrats. Modesto Maidique, president of Florida International University, argues that John McCain will be a powerful candidate both in Cuban South Florida and in the state generally, and he is almost certainly correct. And the Democratic consultants and campaign workers I spoke with struck me as taking their wishes for reality when they suggested that McCain won't have coattails. As the influential State Representative David Rivera, admittedly himself an interested party on the Republican side of the political divide, put it to me: ''I concede that if you poll people who have come here from Cuba over the past decade, they feel differently than the 1959 or even the Mariel generation. But I think the people who say they represent a fundamental shift are deluding themselves.''
 Yet even Rivera conceded that the hard-line voting bloc is aging. His conviction that the 2008 cycle would comfortably return Mario and Lincoln Diaz-Balart to Congress and help put Florida's electoral votes in John McCain's column was, in part at least, based on his belief that ''it's older people who vote.'' As he told me, ''We call them supervoters, and they are overwhelmingly hard-line anti-Castro and pro-democracy.'' Of the Mariel generation -- between that of the revolutionary-era exiles and the most recent generations, and named for the harbor from which as many as 125,000 people left Cuba for the U.S. in 1980 -- Rivera said it was predominantly, if not monolithically, ''anti-Castro, pro-democracy, anti-Communist.''
 Regarding the 300,000 or more people who have come from Cuba to the United States in the past 10 years, Rivera presented a subtle picture. ''Anecdotally,'' he told me, ''it's not that the post-1994 generation is pro-Castro, but instead that they think politics ruined their lives in Cuba, and so they are deeply apolitical. Whatever my Democratic friends may be telling themselves, whatever Raul [Martinez] and Joe [Garcia] may be hoping, they're not ready to be energized politically.'' There is little doubt that antipolitics is the strongest form of politics among these recent arrivals. Unlike earlier generations of exiles, most are not mourning the non-Communist Cuba that was and might have been. For them, Communism is a fact of life from childhood, not something alien -- however much most may detest the regime and be glad to have made their way to the U.S. And while most would probably say they value the freedoms of the United States, there is little doubt that many, if not most, left for economic and family reasons.
 How this translates into American politics is another question. When I asked Rivera if he thought that, in the long run, this generation would not alter the political terms of reference in the Cuban-American community, his answer was curiously ambiguous and seemed more like a statement of faith than the conclusion of a hardheaded, savvy modern American politician. ''By the time you have critical mass,'' he said musingly, ''with an ability to make a difference, we may all be back in Cuba.''
 Marco Rubio, speaker of the Florida Legislature and Rivera's colleague, friend and political ally -- both men supported Mike Huckabee in the Republican primaries, then endorsed John McCain and are working hard for him throughout South Florida -- was at pains to emphasize his sympathy for anyone who wanted to send money to their relatives on the island. Like Rivera, Rubio readily conceded that people who have arrived in Miami from Cuba in the past 5 to 10 years did harbor different attitudes. ''It would be disingenuous of me to pretend otherwise,'' he told me. But Rubio thoughtfully defended the 2004 restrictions on both practical and ethical grounds. ''Let me give you some context,'' he told me, ''the kind of context I don't hear when I listen to Joe or Raul -- and incidentally, Raul has been a career politician for 30 years, and Joe has been politically active for years, so I don't really see how they can call themselves new faces on the South Florida scene.'' Having made his point, Rubio returned to the context of the embargo: ''First of all, in 2004, we had realized that unrestricted remittances had become a cash cow for the Castro regime. As for the travel limitations, I would never criticize anyone for visiting family members. But that wasn't the problem. What you had was a situation where people would come to Miami from Cuba, stay for a year and a day and then go back. And what this was doing was threatening the sustainability of the Cuban Adjustment Act itself, the U.S. law that gives Cubans who come to this country a special status as political exiles rather than immigrants.
 ''What makes Cubans different from Haitians who come here or anyone else,'' Rubio went on, ''if they go back and forth, that is to say, if they're not exiles at all? In that case, why should Cubans be any different? The whole structure would have unraveled had something not been done.''
 Rubio was saying that neither Washington nor the Cuban-exile community could accept a historical-political exile morphing into a contemporary economic migration. It was an argument that I was surprised not to have heard more often from supporters of the Diaz-Balarts and other politicians on the Republican side: that the embargo was necessary to preserve the status of Cubans in America as political exiles. At the least, the recent intensification of the debate within the Cuban-American community has caused people like Rubio to defend positions that initially seem more like role reversal than political orthodoxy. Thus, supporters of a loosening of the embargo spoke about the emancipatory effects of tourism and big business while a conservative like Rubio justified the embargo at least in part because, as he put it, ''otherwise American businesses will just go to Cuba and prefer to do business with the government. Corporations are not interested in democracy; they're interested in making money, in capitalism. Look at China. There businesses don't have to abide by environmental standards, union rights, human rights generally.'' It is a peculiar world when the conservative hard-liners fear the results of a free market and the left-leaning reformers want to give capitalism a chance.
 Whether Joe Garcia and Raul Martinez win their bet, or instead, the Diaz-Balarts manage to win in what will almost certainly be a very bad cycle for Congressional Republicans, the change in Cuban Miami is palpable. Even the rhetoric of Washington politicians campaigning in South Florida seems to have grown more nuanced, as if these politicians and their staffs know that even David Rivera's hard-line ''supervoters'' are no longer as likely to be appeased by symbolism as they often were in the past. After Senator Obama's speech produced little outcry -- with only a few diehards accusing him and the foundation, which hosted him, of being Communists or the dupes of Communists -- Raul Rodriguez said to me that what he and many people he knew were most grateful for was that, so far, neither John McCain nor Barack Obama ''put on a guayabera or shouted, 'Viva Cuba libre.' It may have taken 50 years, but that at least is no longer acceptable.''

HEADLINE: The Fannie And Freddie Fallout

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
IT'S dispiriting indeed to watch the United States financial system, supposedly the envy of the world, being taken to its knees. But that's the show we're watching, brought to you by somnambulant regulators, greedy bank executives and incompetent corporate directors.
 This wasn't the way the ''ownership society'' was supposed to work. Investors weren't supposed to watch their financial stocks plummet more than 70 percent in less than a year. And taxpayers weren't supposed to be left holding defaulted mortgages and abandoned homes while executives who presided over balance sheet implosions walked away with millions. 
 Over the course of this 18-month financial crisis, we have lurched from land mine to land mine. Last week's was all about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant government-sponsored enterprises set up to provide affordable housing across the nation. By issuing debt, these shareholder-owned companies guarantee or own more than $5 trillion in home mortgages. Got that? $5 trillion.
 Because the federal government established the companies, investors view them as backed, at least implicitly, by taxpayers. And that implied guarantee is what drove Fannie and Freddie's business models. 
 The advantages the companies gained from this unique arrangement were huge. They had to keep less cash on hand than traditional lenders, for example. They also made more money on their mortgages than lenders because they paid less to borrow money in the bond market. These profits enriched Fannie and Freddie shareholders over the years and bestowed significant wealth on the companies' executives. 
 Now it looks as if the bill for that largess is coming due. Of course, it will be borne by the usual bagholders: United States taxpayers. You and me.
 For years, anyone warning that Fannie and Freddie should beef up their financial positions was ridiculed or run over by the lobbying machines these companies kept oiled and close at hand. So their lucrative arrangement remained the same: business as usual, with all its riches, was the goal. After all, wasting money by inflating their cash cushions would just crimp their style. 
 Suddenly, Fannie and Freddie's relatively anemic capital supply is a concern. Last week, Fannie's stock plummeted to $10.25, down 74 percent in 2008. Freddie's shares also dived, closing at $7.75, a loss of 77 percent this year.
 Even as investors were stampeding out of these stocks, the claque in Washington rushed to reassure them. Both Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, said the mortgage giants' regulators confirmed that the companies were ''adequately capitalized.''
 THAT was supposed to signal that the companies wouldn't have to raise capital immediately because regulators had the problem firmly in hand. But investors have good reason to be skeptical. In the first half of 2007, both Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson sang a similar tune when they opined that problems in the mortgage market were ''contained'' to subprime loans.
 Talk of adequate capital also brings to mind comments made last March, when Bear Stearns was on the ropes, by Christopher Cox, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He tried to calm investors by telling them that Bear Stearns passed financial muster. Days later, the firm was toe-tagged.
 Which brings us to the main problem: credibility. Wall Street and our senior regulators seem to be running out of that precious commodity almost as quickly as cash.
 It wasn't as if this problem came out of left field. Fears that Fannie and Freddie were getting too big have been a recurring theme in recent years. And Congress has had ample opportunity to create a new regulator that would be vigilant about ensuring the safety and soundness of both companies. 
 But even after both companies were found to have accounted for their results improperly, Freddie Mac in 2003 and Fannie Mae in 2004, Congress failed to act. As a result, Fannie and Freddie were allowed to become high-growth companies and stock market darlings.
 ''These companies would have been fine had they been forced to be the cyclical utilities they were intended to be,'' said Josh Rosner, an analyst at Graham-Fisher, an independent research firm in New York. ''They would be healthy and able to help the markets in this time of illiquidity.''
 Instead, they are in trouble and their woes are infecting the entire stock market.
 The surprise is not that Fannie and Freddie grew too large for the taxpayers' good. That was to be expected among companies run by executives whose pay is based on profit growth.
 Rather it is that Congress and the various financial regulators, especially the Fed and the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, did little to keep the companies from getting out of control. 
 MAYBE the loans held or backed by Fannie and Freddie will turn out to be better performers than those held by other lenders. That would mean fewer losses than investors seem to be anticipating now and would still the cries for fresh capital.
 But if their losses follow the patterns seen at other lenders, some sort of regulatory takeover may occur. That would mean a lot of pain for a lot of folks -- especially both companies' stockholders and the broader community of people depending on a secure, smoothly functioning mortgage market.
 ''The real outrage is that none of this had to happen,'' said William A. Fleckenstein, co-author of ''Greenspan's Bubbles: The Age of Ignorance at the Federal Reserve'' and president of Fleckenstein Capital in Issaquah, Wash. ''We did not have to ruin the financial system and ruin the financial lives of a huge chunk of the middle class in the United States.''
 ''It is crystal clear that the Fed not only made mistakes, they had the pompoms out, cheering for deregulation,'' he adds. ''Until people recognize why we are in this mess, I don't see how we get out of this thing.''
 A week ago, Bridgewater Associates, a research firm, estimated that losses from the credit crisis we're now mired in might amount to $1.6 trillion when all is said and done.
 We'll have to wait years to see if this is accurate. But whatever the number is, it will also represent, in stunning red ink, the cost to society of financiers who are shortsighted and greedy and regulators who don't regulate.

 BODY:
THE NEWS At a summit meeting in Japan, leaders of the eight major industrial economies, including the United States, pledged to cut global emissions of greenhouse gases in half by 2050. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Though the pledge included few specifics and no shorter-term goals, it was seen as a marked departure for President Bush, who had resisted calls for concerted international efforts to combat global warming for years, ever since he rejected the Kyoto Protocol early in his tenure. In return, the other G-8 nations went along with his insistence that any binding treaty to cut emissions must also include major developing economies like India and China.
 THE NEWS President Bush signed legislation that expands the government's surveillance powers and shields phone companies from liability for cooperating with a government program of wiretaps without warrants.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The White House and Congressional Democrats had argued over the program since it was revealed in 2005 that the government was eavesdropping without court approval on international communications of Americans suspected of terrorist ties. The disclosure prompted a national debate over how much civil liberties should yield to national security concerns. In the end, the White House got nearly everything it wanted. 
 THE NEWS The Pentagon decided to reopen the bidding for a $35 billion order for tanker aircraft, the most lucrative ever awarded by the Air Force.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The Air Force has been trying to replace its aging fleet of tankers for 12 years, but politics, missteps and scandal have repeatedly blocked the way. The Pentagon's decision was seen as a rebuke to the Air Force, which awarded the deal to a partnership of Northrop Grumman and EADS, the parent of Airbus, in February. Auditors later concluded the process was flawed, while politicians complained that a foreign supplier had been chosen over Boeing, which now gets a second chance to win the order. 
 THE NEWS Saying there were signs that the turmoil in the housing market may last into 2009, Ben. S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the Fed would issue long-awaited new rules next week restricting mortgages with exotic terms and high-cost loans to borrowers with poor credit. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The Fed has wanted for months to rein in the kinds of risky lending that helped bring on the crisis. It also said it might extend a temporary program of low-rate loans to Wall Street firms, while the Treasury weighed steps to shore up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two main issuers of mortgage-backed securities, whose stocks plunged during the week.
 THE NEWS Six-way talks on how to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons programs resumed in Beijing after a nine-month hiatus.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The talks among North Korea, its Asian neighbors and the United States were stalled waiting for the North to produce a declaration of its nuclear activities, which it finally delivered in June, six months late. It also blew up a reactor cooling tower as a token of its sincerity. Those steps got the country off the official American roster of terror-sponsor states, to the dismay of conservatives who say Washington made too many concessions. Now the focus around the table is on how to verify that North Korea has come clean.

HEADLINE: It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's Super-Mogul!

BYLINE: By JULI S. CHARKES

DATELINE: White Plains 

 BODY:
 GENE LANDRES began a recent workweek inspecting construction equipment in Manhattan and Elizabeth, N. J., part of his job as the president of Techworld Solutions, a Stamford company that provides cranes locally and around the globe.
 But unlike most Monday commuters, Mr. Landres conducted his business from an unusual vantage point. Forgoing traffic that had the potential to fray nerves and take up most of his day, he hopped aboard a helicopter based at Westchester County Airport here and circled the inspection sites from 1,000 feet in the air.
 The helicopter is owned by Keith Vitolo, 33, a former banker who lives in Mamaroneck. Years of working in aircraft financing, coupled with his own travel mishaps -- an airline computer glitch that forced him to spend hours in Detroit despite perfect flying conditions is a particular sore point -- convinced Mr. Vitolo that there were people who would prize speed over cost, ease over congestion. 
 ''People are fed up with airlines,'' he said, adding, ''They don't want to sit in traffic. It's one of the most stressful experiences you can have.'' 
 Last month, Mr. Vitolo began operating AwesomeFlight.com, a one-helicopter charter service, from the Westchester County Airport. He joined a handful of companies that operate helicopter service there, catering to a niche population that has both the inclination and wherewithal to forgo traditional means of transportation.
 That niche may be impervious to a bumpy economy, based as it is on a clientele willing to pay anywhere from several hundred to several thousand dollars for a trip that in most cases takes under an hour. A one-way trip from White Plains to Manhattan on Mr. Vitolo's helicopter, a Robinson R-44 Raven II, for example, takes 30 minutes and costs between $500 and $750, depending on the day of the week.
 At the opposite end of that scale is a commute on Associated Aircraft Group's Sikorsky S-76, powered by a twin turbine engine. The S-76 is a variation of the craft used in the military for rescue operations and to transport the president, said Carolyn Marino, Associated's director of sales and marketing. The company, owned by Sikorsky, flies in and out of Westchester Airport frequently. A one-way trip from White Plains to Manhattan on one of these aircraft costs about $4,200, for up to six or seven passengers, Ms. Marino said.
 Ms. Marino declined to identify the clientele willing to pay up to 700 times the cost of a one-way train ticket from White Plains to Manhattan if there is only one passenger aboard. But she did describe them as an elite group of executives culled from the upper echelons of American business -- for whom confidentiality is as valued as efficiency. ''We fly some of the biggest names in the corporate world,'' she said. 
 On a sun-drenched Monday, two Associated pilots, Yuval Hadaya and John Manghini, brought their helicopter down for a landing directly beside Mr. Vitolo's helicopter at Westchester Airport, dwarfing the bubble-shaped Raven, which was being prepared for Mr. Landres's inspection tour, temporarily drowning out conversation. 
 Westchester has one of the area's strictest noise abatement programs in the metropolitan area and a voluntary no-fly period between midnight and 6:30 a.m., said Harry Stanton, the county's deputy commissioner of transportation. 
 Mr. Stanton said that a small number of the noise complaints the county receives involve helicopters: of the 206 it received in May, 20 were related to helicopters, he said.
 Mr. Hadaya and Mr. Manghini were returning from a trip to Southampton, a frequent destination for them. 
 While Mr. Vitolo does not expect a drop in his business as the economy weakens, some in the aviation field indicated a softening in the charter business as a result of the downturn in the economy.
 John Boyd, the general manager of Panorama Flight Service, which provides fuel, maintenance and other aviation services to chartered aircraft, including helicopters, at Westchester Airport, sees a dip. He said that in the past three to four months, there has been about a 10 percent decrease in Panorama's business at the airport, which includes helicopters and jet planes. 
 Javier Diez, the owner of Wings Air, which has been operating chartered helicopter and jet service out of Westchester for six years, said that recent shifts on Wall Street have cut his helicopter flights in half, to two or three a day.
 But Mr. Diez was quick to point out distinctions in the market between titans and the merely super-rich. ''There are two segments to this business,'' he said, pointing out the difference between those affected by diminished bonuses or layoffs and an entirely separate clientele that remains immune to any shifts. ''You will always have demand from the high-end clientele,'' he said.
 Signs of that portion of the clientele were on display on a recent Saturday morning at Panorama, where their BMWs and high-end sports cars sat in the parking lot near the hangar that houses Mr. Vitolo's helicopter, as well as a collection of chartered jets, including a 10-passenger Challenger 600 that makes regular trans-Atlantic trips. ''Aviation continues to be vibrant in this area,'' Mr. Boyd said.
 Mr. Vitolo said he had spent many months honing his business plan and calculating the costs involved in running a charter business that used what he called a state-of-the-art flying machine, with safety features like G.P.S. navigation and collision-avoidance systems that were unavailable on smaller aircraft a few years ago. Insurance is more than $16,000 a year; maintenance -- required every 100 hours of flight by the Federal Aviation Administration -- costs up to $3,000 each time. 
 Rising fuel costs are an additional consideration. Mr. Boyd at Panorama said that jet fuel now costs $6 to $7 a gallon, up $2 or more in the last year.
 Still, Mr. Vitolo echoed a sentiment expressed by others in the aviation field -- that demand for his kind of service is a luxury sought out by a select demographic group in areas like Westchester, particularly once they have experienced private flight. ''Once you fly like this, you're spoiled,'' Mr. Vitolo said. ''You just never want to go back to commercial flights.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 13 about a small helicopter chartering service at the Westchester County airport for business executives and other people short on time, and a picture caption with the article, misspelled the name of one of the customers last summer. He was Eugene V. Lyandres, not Landres. Mr. Lyandres only recently brought the misspelling to the editors' attention.
An article on July 13 about helicopter charters at the Westchester County Airport for business executives and other people short on time misspelled the surname of the owner of Wings Air, one of the charter service operators. He is Javier Diaz, not Diez. (Mr. Diaz pointed out the error in an e-mail message on Feb. 3.)

HEADLINE: You're on Autopilot, but Check the Speedometer

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
TARGET-DATE funds have been sold as a kind of autopilot for 401(k) plans, freeing workers from ever having to look at their retirement accounts. But the funds may need a second look themselves.
 A new study has found a striking lack of consensus about how the funds should operate, leaving employees and retirees exposed to widely varying levels of risk. The fees that the funds charge vary widely, too. 
 Although target-date funds have won a special blessing from the government as a safe place for companies to put workers' 401(k) money, the industry has no solid indexes or guidelines for assessing their performance. That means a worker who wanted to check on his target-date fund may have some difficulty assessing it. While research exists on various funds' history, there is no accepted benchmark for comparison and no agreement on what constitutes success, wealth preservation or high returns.
 Despite a lack of consensus about the funds, they have attracted a flood of money. 
 ''You're talking about the vehicle that's going to constitute, far and away, the savings of American workers,'' said Charlie Ruffel, chief executive of PlanSponsor, a publishing and research firm that issued the new study, together with Target Date Analytics, a research and advisory firm. Mr. Ruffel predicted that roughly 75 percent of the assets in 401(k) accounts would soon make their way into target-date funds. 
 As of the end of 2007, about 5 percent of the assets in employer-sponsored defined-contribution retirement plans, like 401(k)'s, were in target-date funds, according to the Investment Company Institute.
 Zvi Bodie, a finance professor at Boston University, said he believed that federal regulators made a mistake when they gave their blessing to target-date funds. While the funds have some advantages over previous choices, he said, the problem is that they are being sold as wealth-preservation tools for retirement. Actually, many of the target-date funds hold substantial amounts of stock, even on the date when a shareholder is to turn 65. 
 Some groups of investors will certainly be turning 65 when the markets are producing losses, he said, and the consequences of losses in retirement could be severe. That would be true for many wage earners today, who have 401(k) accounts but no guaranteed pensions or other retirement nest eggs. ''It is, I think, a disaster waiting to happen,'' Mr. Bodie said.
 The study analyzed all 38 of the target-date funds on the market at the end of 2007. All of the funds offered younger workers a portfolio weighted toward stocks, gradually shifting toward a greater share of fixed-income instruments, like bonds, as the workers aged.
 Beyond that, however, there was no agreement about how fast this shift should occur, or about the best asset allocation when a participant reached the all-important ''target date,'' usually assumed to be age 65. Some funds would be 65 percent invested in stocks on the target date, while the stock total for other funds might be just 10 percent. The funds also differed on what they expected investors to do with their money after their target dates.
 The rate at which the funds changed their asset allocations over time -- a crucial formulation known in the industry as a ''glide path'' -- also varied greatly. Some funds' glide paths were flat, others steep. 
 The annual fees they charged ranged from 0.21 percent, the average charged by the Vanguard Group's family of target-date funds, to 1.40 percent, the average charged by the Payden/Wilshire Longevity Funds family. 
 A SEEMINGLY endless supply of research has shown that many American workers are not up to the challenge of investing for retirement. Some do not save at all, while others try, only to pull out their money too early. Some people save diligently but make unsuitable investments, like putting all of their money into their employer's stock, or into low-yielding money market funds that do not keep up with inflation. Others chase the latest ''hot'' mutual funds and overpay. 
 Even those who make rational investment decisions when they are young may fail to recognize that their risk profile changes over time, and never get around to making the appropriate portfolio changes. 
 ''The problem for human beings is, we get busy,'' said Nevin Adams, the editor in chief of PlanSponsor's publications. ''We just don't go back and revisit our assumptions.'' 
 Employers have begun to address some of these failings by automatically enrolling newly hired workers in 401(k) plans, rather than waiting for employees to sign up themselves. 
 But automatic enrollment raises other questions: Into what type of fund should employees be enrolled? And can an employer be accused of breaching its fiduciary duties if it put workers into a fund that lost their money? 
 The Labor Department's effort to answer those questions set off the current boom in target-date funds. The department issued a regulation last year saying that employers could not be held liable for 401(k) losses if they had taken care to enroll their workers in investment funds that had diversified portfolios and reflected the number of years before the employees would retire. 
 The target-date funds qualified under the department's criteria, opening the money floodgates. 
 Big players in the mutual fund industry offered one-stop shopping to employers. Thus, if an employer happened to be using Fidelity as its record-keeper, for example, it might be given the sole option of using the Fidelity Freedom Funds as a target-date fund for its employees. Fidelity has more than $81 billion under management in its target-date funds, more than any other fund family. The PlanSponsor survey gave Fidelity Freedom funds an A for performance, but only a C for fees. Its average fee for institutional accounts was 0.74 percent, a little less than the industry average of 0.81 percent, PlanSponsor said. 
 On risk, Fidelity got a D. That is because PlanSponsor's comparison of all funds' worst quarters from 2005 to 2007 showed that Fidelity's Freedom Funds suffered worse losses than the average for each fund's peer group. (The only exception involved Fidelity's funds for investors who have already reached their target dates. Those funds' losses in their worst quarters were about the same as the average for their peers.) Risk is related to asset allocation, and an investor in the Freedom Funds could expect to have 50 percent of his portfolio in equities upon reaching age 65. 
 Ren Cheng, chief investment officer for Fidelity's global asset allocation group, said he believed Fidelity had received a bad grade for risk because PlanSponsor had used a benchmarking system that unduly rewarded conservative investing. Mr. Cheng said he did not think such a system accurately reflected human behavior, because Fidelity's clients often said its target-date funds seemed too conservative, not too risky. Researchers at Morningstar, by contrast, have given most Fidelity Freedom funds four stars out of a maximum possible five. At the moment, Morningstar's system does not award a separate grade for risk. 
 Quinn Keeler, PlanSponsor's head of research and surveys, said that any benchmarking of target-date funds was bound to be subjective. But, she added, ''I would think you'd want to err on the side of conservative, and make sure there's wealth preservation.'' This is especially true now that more and more companies are automatically enrolling employees in target-date funds, she said.
 A much smaller family of target-date funds, the TDAX Independence funds, offers a different approach. The TDAX funds are structured as exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.'s, which trade continuously like stocks. The funds' investors will hold less than 10 percent of their 401(k) accounts in equities at age 65. The remainder will be in fixed income and cash. 
 Michael C. Smith of Zacks Investment Research, who designed the TDAX funds' investment models, said he wanted ''to greatly reduce the exposure to risk when we get close to the target date.'' This would help prevent losses of principal as workers prepared to retire, he said. At that point, they could pull out all their money and use it to produce a stream of secure, inflation-protected retirement income -- perhaps in an annuity or a portfolio of Treasury inflation-protected securities. 
 BY contrast, Charles W. Kadlec, president of Seligman Advisors and the portfolio manager for J.& W. Seligman & Company's target-date funds, designed a fund family that investors are expected to stay in even after they retire, drawing down a small part of their money each year. The Seligman offerings are mutual funds that hold E.T.F.'s within them. He said extensive computer simulations had shown that a portfolio holding 75 percent equities on an investor's target date offered the best path to staying ahead of inflation. (Fifty-five percent of the portfolio was in domestic stocks; the remaining equities consisted of international stocks and shares of real estate investment trusts.)
 Mr. Kadlec sharply disputed the idea that such an asset allocation exposed retirees to too much market risk. But he acknowledged that his research showed that in extreme market conditions, 10 percent of retirees would run out of money within 20 years, which some people might find unacceptable. 
 ''You have to look at your other financial assets, and see if you're comfortable with that 55 percent equity allocation,'' he said. 
 Discussions are under way among Congressional staff members, academics and others about whether the Labor Department needs to tighten up its target-date fund regulation, said Dallas L. Salisbury, chief executive of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit research center in Washington. He said the issue was likely to come under review after the election this fall. 
 ''Did the government do the right thing?'' he asked. ''How did it protect the participants? Should it be possible for all those different variations to be eligible for a safe harbor from the Labor Department? Or should there be more of a standard set? 
 ''Those are exactly the type of questions that are likely to be front and center as that next review takes place,'' he said.

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 13 in the Mutual Funds Report, Part 2 of this section, about target-date funds misstated the percentage of equities and real estate investment trust shares that a 65-year-old investor in J.& W. Seligman & Company's target-date funds would hold. The total would be 65 percent of the portfolio, with an additional 35 percent in fixed-income investments. Such an investor's portfolio would not be 75 percent equities and real estate investment trusts.

HEADLINE: Public Radio To Cancel A Morning Experiment

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH JENSEN

 BODY:
National Public Radio officials are expected on Monday to tell the staff members of ''Bryant Park Project'' that their experimental weekday morning program, designed to draw a younger audience to public radio and capture listeners who had moved online, is being canceled.
 The last broadcast of this New York-based program, which many listeners tuned into at npr.org rather than over the air, is expected to be on July 25. It's an expensive failure -- the first-year budget was more than $2 million -- and comes at a time when NPR is facing the same financial constraints as other news media thanks to higher costs and a downturn in underwriting. 
 Like other news organizations, NPR has been grappling with how best to capture the online audience, and ''Bryant Park Project,'' which had its debut on Oct. 1, was one of its boldest attempts. The live two-hour program ranged through news and cultural topics in an informal, conversational manner and differed from more traditional NPR broadcasts, which rely heavily on prepackaged reports. 
 ''Bryant Park Project'' includes cheeky features like ''Make Me Care,'' which points up news reports' real-life relevance. It also has a robust Web presence that is updated with blog posts throughout the day and also includes video. 
 Andi Sporkin, an NPR spokeswoman, declined on Sunday to comment on the status of ''Bryant Park Project.'' 
 The program's host, Alison Stewart, who is on maternity leave, said in a telephone interview that she had been informed of the cancellation, which comes after the NPR board's approval last week of a budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. ''From what I understand, we are obviously in extra-tough economic times, and it is a financial and strategic decision,'' she said. ''I was told it had absolutely nothing to do with the quality or content of the show.''
 Although the program is heard over the air on just five radio stations and available on 19 high-definition digital channels, NPR officials said publicly in recent months that ''Bryant Park Project'' was attracting the kind of Web audience they had hoped for. One NPR employee, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the program had one million individual, or ''unique'' listeners in both April and May. 
 Ms. Stewart said she was surprised that the program had been canceled but said, ''I also understand the economic reality.''
 She added: ''We worked our hearts out, and I think we succeeded in many ways.''
 ''Bryant Park Project'' had a rocky start when one of the original co-hosts, Luke Burbank, quit just before the debut. (He ended up staying through mid-December.) Ms. Stewart went on maternity leave in April, and the news anchor, Rachel Martin, left for ABC News in May. Mike Pesca has been filling in as host. 
 In addition to the on-air changes, two top NPR executives who helped develop the program have left the organization. Jay Kernis, the senior vice president of programming, went to CNN, and Ken Stern, NPR's chief executive, departed in March after the board decided not to renew his contract. 
 ''Bryant Park Project'' is one of two entrants hoping to broaden the morning public-radio lineup that has long been dominated by NPR's ''Morning Edition.'' WNYC in New York and Public Radio International introduced ''The Takeaway'' on April 28, which is also live. The hosts are Adaora Udoji and John Hockenberry; it is produced in association with the BBC, WGBH and The New York Times. 
 Ms. Stewart, who is 42 and until recently was also a contributor to NBC News, said she would return from maternity leave as planned on July 21 for the show's last week. After that, she said, she is not sure what she will do, although she said that NPR had ''expressed strong interest'' in having her stay.

The desperate worry over the health of huge financial institutions with country cousin names -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- reflects a reality that has reshaped major spheres of American life: the government has in recent months taken on an increasingly dominant role in assuring that Americans can buy a home or attend college.
 Much of the private money that once surged into the mortgage industry has fled in a panicked horde, leaving most of the responsibility for financing American homes to the government-sponsored Fannie and Freddie. 
 Two years ago, when commercial banks were still jostling for fatter slices of the housing market, the share of outstanding mortgages Fannie and Freddie owned and guaranteed dipped below 40 percent, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by Moody's Economy.com. By the first three months of this year, Fannie and Freddie were buying more than two-thirds of all new residential mortgages. 
 A similar trend is playing out in the realm of student loans. As commercial banks concluded that the business of lending to college students was no longer quite so profitable, the Bush administration promised in May to buy their federally guaranteed student loans, giving the banks capital to continue lending. 
 In short, in a nation that holds itself up as a citadel of free enterprise, the government has transformed from a reliable guarantor into effectively the only lender for millions of Americans engaged in the largest transactions of their lives.
 Before, its more modest mission was to make more loans available at lower rates. Now it is to make sure loans are made at all. The government is setting the terms and the standards of Americans' biggest loans.
 On Sunday, that federal oversight and protection was made more explicit, as the Bush administration sought to mount a rescue of Fannie and Freddie, asking Congress to devote public money to buying the two companies' flagging stocks.
 The new reality is scorned by libertarians and conservatives, who fear state intrusions on the market, and by populists and progressives, who dislike the idea of education and housing increasingly resting upon the government's willingness to finance it. 
 ''If you're a socialist, you should be happy,'' said Michael Lind, a fellow at the New America Foundation, a research institute in Washington. ''But you should really wonder whether you want people's ability to pay for housing and college dependent on the motives of people in Washington.''
 The government is trying to support plummeting housing prices and spare strapped homeowners from the wrath of the market: last week, the Senate adopted a bill authorizing the Federal Housing Administration to insure up to $300 billion in refinanced mortgages, enabling borrowers saddled with unaffordable loans to get better terms. 
 How the government came to dominate these two crucial areas of American lending is -- depending on one's ideological bent -- a narrative of regulatory and market failure, or a cautionary tale about bureaucratic meddling in commerce. Perhaps it is both.
 To those prone to blame lax regulation, the mortgage fiasco was the inevitable result of a quarter-century in which American policy makers prayed at the altar of market fundamentalism, letting entrepreneurs succeed or fail on their own.
 This was the spirit in which Alan Greenspan, the longtime chairman of the Federal Reserve, allowed banks to engineer unfathomably complicated webs of mortgage-based investments that, through the first half of this decade, sent real estate prices soaring and expanded homeownership.
 The banks relied on these investments to raise money for the next wave of loans. The system worked so long as lenders could keep selling their mortgages, and so long as someone would guarantee most of the debts. Fannie and Freddie took care of both tasks. Together, they now guarantee or own roughly half of the nation's $12 trillion mortgage market.
 Belief in Fannie and Freddie gave banks a sense of certainty as they plowed more of their capital into residential mortgages. That easy financing, in turn, brought more and more people into the market for homes, generating a belief that American real estate prices could keep rising forever.
 And that contributed to the banks' ultimately making extraordinarily risky loans, which defaulted first when home prices started falling. As lending became conservative, the whole speculative bubble burst. 
 As some called for intervention by the Fed to cool a speculative binge, Mr. Greenspan resisted. He believed the risks of real estate were effectively limited because debt was widely dispersed. The market would sort it all out.
 ''Alan Greenspan had this view that the light hand of regulation was best,'' said Vincent R. Reinhart, a former Federal Reserve economist and now a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. 
 When housing prices commenced plummeting, the ugly truth emerged that many banks did not understand the details of the mortgage-backed investments they owned. Ignorance proved expensive. 
 As one bank after another announced losses that now exceed $400 billion and that some estimate will ultimately cross the trillion-dollar mark, money ran screaming from the field, leaving Fannie and Freddie pretty much the only players. 
 A general fear of debt took hold. Banks that had offered loans to students under a federally guaranteed program suddenly could not sell investments linked to those outstanding debts, meaning they could not raise cash for the next crop of loans. Dozens of banks pulled out of the program. 
 ''What's happened kind of speaks for itself,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. ''You had this effort to weaken the government's role. There was this conscious effort to turn things over to the private sector, and it failed.''
 But there is a parallel narrative, the story that critics and competitors of Fannie and Freddie have told for years: how the two companies exploited their pedigree as entities backed by the government to secure an unfair advantage over the private sector.
 They swelled into highly leveraged behemoths, it was said, on the implicit guarantee that the government would step in and rescue them if they ever got into trouble. This allowed them to borrow money more cheaply than their competitors could, enabling them to make loans more cheaply.
 That secured more business and rewarded their shareholders, along with their handsomely compensated executives. It emboldened them to trade in highly risky investments.
 ''They were using their privileged position as favored children of the government to dominate the market, and taxpayers were on the hook for substantial risk,'' said Martin N. Baily, a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration. ''You couldn't possibly say this was a pure unfettered market.''
 The government was getting something for its protective largess. It was using Fannie and Freddie to pursue the social goal of broader homeownership, particularly among racial minorities.
 ''When you're looking at the upside, here's the government helping people get mortgages and student loans,'' said David R. Henderson, a self-described libertarian economist at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. ''The downside is there might be a bailout and then you pay in taxes. These things don't come cost-free when government gets involved.''
 As the Bush administration readies funds to buy student loans from cash-short banks, and officials plot a potential bailout of Fannie and Freddie that could run into tens of billions of dollars, the government's outsize role in these two huge areas will not shrink anytime soon.
 It seems a strange coda to an era in which markets were sacred, and regulation heresy.
 For a generation, American policy makers have lectured the world on the need to unleash the animal instincts of the market. China's rickety banks should stop lending to protect state factory jobs, Americans said, and focus on the bottom line. Now the Bush administration is reluctantly concluding that Fannie and Freddie might need to be propped up to protect the American homeowner.
 During much of Japan's lost decade of the 1990s, Americans called for an end to its coddling of weak banks. Better to let them keel over, along with the paper tiger companies they sustained. No company was ''too big to fail,'' Washington said.
 Yet here, in the aftermath of a financial crisis brought on by what were once called American virtues -- financial engineering and risk management -- Washington may bail out Fannie and Freddie for the simple reason that they are too big to fail. If they go down, so do whole neighborhoods. So, perhaps, does the global financial system.
 ''The thing we have to do now is to make sure that Fannie and Freddie remain solvent and continue to make loans,'' Mr. Baily said. ''We just don't have any choice.''

HEADLINE: Advertising in Europe Softens, and More Goes to the Internet

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Not long ago, European advertising executives seemed confident that they could ride out the storm in the United States economy and the global rise in food and energy costs.
 Now, they and the media owners who rely on their business are worried that European marketers will slash ad budgets, as many of their counterparts have already done in America. 
 ''Definitely, if our clients suffer from higher petrol costs, spending is going to be affected,'' said Valerie Accary, president of CLM/BBDO, an agency based in Paris owned by the Omnicom Group. ''So far we haven't seen it, but the second half is a big concern.''
 ZenithOptimedia, a media buying agency that is part of Publicis Groupe, recently downgraded its forecast for ad spending in Western Europe, saying it would grow by 3.7 percent this year -- barely more than the inflation rate. That is still better than the 3.5 percent growth expected in North America, but a reduction of two-tenths of a percentage point from the previous forecast, issued only three months earlier.
 That may not seem like a large revision. But the new numbers mask bigger shifts in spending, as advertisers allocate more of their budgets to the Internet, cutting their allocations to broadcast and print advertising.
 ''If you're in some of the traditional media in Western Europe, you're not going to see much growth over the next year or so,'' said Jonathan Barnard, head of publications at ZenithOptimedia in London. 
 Among the big European markets, analysts say Britain and Spain may be most at risk, as their economies slow sharply in response to housing slumps. France and Italy are also showing softness, while Germany is holding up after a wobble early this year.
 For some individual media owners, feeling the combined effects of the shift to the Internet and the economic downturn, an ad recession has already arrived. Trinity Mirror, a British newspaper publisher, said last month that advertising had fallen 12.6 percent in May and June.
 Analysts at Citigroup issued a warning last week about advertising prospects for several big European television broadcasters, including ITV in Britain and ProSiebenSat.1 in Germany.
 While some analysts had speculated that marketers would reduce spending on the Internet in a downturn, deeming it experimental and nonessential, the opposite seems to be happening. In Britain, for instance, Internet ad spending will rise 32 percent this year, according to ZenithOptimedia, a sharp revision from the agency's previous prediction of a 26 percent gain.
 Internet advertising is benefiting because it allows marketers to track the effects of their spending, something that is more difficult to do in other media. Agencies that create advertising, like CLM/BBDO, are feeling the effect.
 ''Clients are saying, 'We don't want big ideas, big projects,' '' Ms. Accary said. ''It's about messages that are effective and right to the point.''

HEADLINE: The Success of Affirmative Action

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Affirmative Distraction'' (Op-Ed, July 6):
 Stephen L. Carter, in his laudable call for a renewed effort to address race and poverty, does not adequately acknowledge the important role that affirmative action has played in unraveling the two. 
 I speak from experience. Raised on welfare by a great-aunt, tracked in the lower rung in the dilapidated public school system in Camden, N.J., I was bound for a marginal economic existence -- if I managed to survive Vietnam. 
 Through affirmative action programs, I got myself into college and then into Yale Law School, where I crossed paths with Mr. Carter. 
 The dramatic growth of the black middle class is attributable to the opportunities that were provided to talented people who would otherwise have suffered from our societal legacy.
 The true ''affirmative distraction'' is a false opposition between race and class. So-called post-race institutions that have experimented with class-only affirmative action have found that they are no substitute for removing the unique disadvantages that are associated with being both nonwhite and poor.

HEADLINE: City Refines Formula To Measure Poverty Rate

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration unveiled a new measure on Sunday for gauging poverty levels, one that takes into account the cost of housing, child care and clothing, among other expenses not included in the formula used by the federal government.
 Under the new model, announced by Linda I. Gibbs, the city's deputy mayor for health and human services, at the N.A.A.C.P.'s annual convention in Cincinnati, the poverty rate in New York City would increase to 23 percent of the population, compared with the official level of roughly 19 percent. Also, fewer people in the city would fall into the category of extreme poverty, partly because the new measure factors in government aid programs like housing assistance, food stamps and tax credits.
 Ms. Gibbs said that the new measures would not automatically affect any federal funding the city receives, or the number of people getting aid. But, she said, the change could affect local programs and policy decisions, like how the city cares for the elderly. 
 According to the current federal measure, fewer than one in five New Yorkers 65 or older are poor. But under the new model, that figure grows to one in three, largely because higher medical costs are taken into account.
 City officials hope that the new model will be adopted by other cities and states, and will also start a national re-examination about the way poverty is gauged. 
 ''The next step,'' Ms. Gibbs said during a conference call with reporters, ''is issuing a very detailed report so our sister jurisdictions can adopt this approach.''
 Mark Greenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research institute in Washington, said the need to recalibrate how poverty is calculated was long overdue.
 ''There is a very broad agreement that the existing measure has a lot of problems,'' he said.
 The nation's poverty measure was developed in the 1960s and was based on a 1955 study that showed that poor Americans spent roughly a third of their after-tax income on food. Ever since then, the country's poverty levels have been gauged by tripling the annual cost of groceries.
 That model, while updated for inflation, has been criticized for being out of date, inaccurate and not taking into account how expenses like housing vary nationwide. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, families nowadays spend one-eighth of their income on food, with more money going to transportation, child care and housing. Nor does the federal model measure the financial impact of government assistance programs.
 The city's formula was developed by its Center for Economic Opportunity and modeled on a proposal developed by the National Academy of Sciences. Both set the poverty threshold at roughly 80 percent of the median amount of what families spend on expenses like food, shelter, utilities and clothing. The New York model also factors in regional differences in the cost of living. 
 Under the new calculus, the poverty threshold for a family of two adults and two children in New York City would be a $26,138 annual income compared with the official level of $20,444. 
 The new model also shows shifts in poverty in the city's boroughs. The Bronx is still the poorest borough, though Brooklyn and Queens are less poor than what the federal government records. Under the city's formula, more Hispanics, Asians and non-Hispanic whites would be considered poor. 
 Still there were questions about how effective the Bloomberg administration's new model would be and how much of it was driven by politics and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's political ambitions.
 ''The poor in the city are still poor, but they're a lot better off than they were 20, 30, 40 years ago, and this measure didn't show it,'' said Douglas J. Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington, speaking of the National Academy of Sciences model on which New York City's new formula is based. ''I think this is all about keeping a lame-duck mayor in the public eye.''

HEADLINE: Parking Rules Return; Cleaner Streets to Follow

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE; April Dembosky and Ann Farmer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It is easy to forget, in celebrating the suspension of street-cleaning parking rules, that such an act is accompanied by the suspension of, well, street cleaning.
 The absence of those lumbering scritchy-scratch street sweepers has not gone unnoticed in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where a two-month hiatus from alternate-side parking rules has created an urban patina of newspapers, coffee cups and water bottles on the side streets.
 ''Honestly, anytime the wind blows, you notice,'' said David Townsend, 32, who works at Big Nose Full Body, a wine store on Seventh Avenue. ''There is so much stuff blowing around.'' He said the leaves and mud were a hindrance when it rained. ''Stuff would be flushed to the storm drain, but no water would go down.'' 
 Jonathan Grass, 31, echoed the relief of Mr. Townsend, his co-worker: ''It's nice they are going to return to cleaning the streets.'' 
 Alternate-side parking rules are scheduled to resume in the neighborhood on Monday, with some changes. Street-cleaning/alternate-side parking regulations were temporarily suspended on May 19 so that thousands of signs -- detailing the new parking regulations -- could replace the old signs.
 In New York City, where having a car invites the anxiety and costs nearly akin to having a young child -- you have to feed it, keep it safe and find it a place to sleep at night -- the car equivalent of sending children off to summer camp is coming to a close for Park Slope residents.
 Other Brooklyn residents, however, now get their turn at parking-regulation-free zones. The second phase of the sign-replacement project will include parts of Carroll Gardens, Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill and Gowanus, according to the Department of Transportation. After those are completed, Red Hook and Columbia Heights will be next.
 But that warp in the space-time continuum of parking rules has left permanent changes in its wake, with 2,800 new street signs that will transform the parking landscape in Park Slope. Now the entire neighborhood will have to shift its collective circadian automobile rhythms -- the ones that have been ingrained from years of conditioning -- to adapt to the new schedules dictated by the signs. 
 Residential street-cleaning parking restrictions, in many cases, have been halved -- reduced to intervals of 90 minutes from three hours, and to once a week instead of twice a week. And there are now additional meters in some business areas, which creates more opportunity for customers to find available parking. 
 Many welcome the tightened schedule. Alex Almonte, a 61-year-old retiree, said he thought three hours was too long -- essentially all of a morning or a good chunk of the afternoon. Mr. Almonte said 90 minutes is just bite-size enough to use the car to run an errand. 
 Some parts of the neighborhood will experience more disruption. On a stretch of Seventh Avenue, the no-parking restriction has changed: Instead of a once-a-week occurrence, drivers will have to move cars parked there from 7:30 to 8:30 a.m., nearly every day. 
 ''I'm very bummed out, especially now on Seventh Avenue,'' said Brian Smith, 38, a screenwriter. ''You won't park if you have to move the next morning.''
 Some residents said they feared the changes will disrupt the understood etiquette that has evolved out of necessity: routines like traffic police discreetly looking the other way at double parking during street cleaning, and the placement of friendly notes with phone numbers should one's car be blocking someone else's car in. Rafael Torres, 48, feared that the police would use the new routines to start a crackdown on double-parked cars. ''It is going be chaotic and unfair,'' he said.
 But no matter what the new rules are, they do not upend the fundamental economics of having a car in the city. David Goodman, 29, a Park Slope resident who does sales for a Silicon Valley company, has had his share of parking woes. Not only was his car broken into once, but he has also often had to circle for 15 minutes to an hour to find a spot. After that, ''the challenge was remembering where I parked,'' said Mr. Goodman, who began to keep notes in his calendar.
 He finally solved his problem: ''I actually broke down and got a parking spot for $400, and it has been a life-changing experience.''

HEADLINE: What's Next in the Law? The Unalienable Rights of Chimps

BYLINE: By ADAM COHEN

 BODY:
Spain's parliament recently passed a resolution granting legal rights to apes. Reaction has been mixed. Peter Singer, a Princeton University bioethics professor and animal liberation activist, declared the vote to be of ''world historical significance.'' The comedian Stephen Colbert -- flashing a photo of a performing chimpanzee -- insisted that the new law had better not give apes ''the right to not wear a tuxedo and roller skates.''
 In fact, it will likely do just that. A nonbinding resolution in Spain, which the Parliament now has to flesh out with more specific laws, allows apes to be kept in zoos but not used in circuses or other kinds of performances. It calls for banning research that harms apes. 
 With the resolution, Spain becomes the world leader in protecting the rights of apes, but perhaps not for long. Austrian animal rights activists are fighting to have a chimp named Matthew Hiasl Pan declared a person. They have lost so far, but are appealing to the European Court of Human Rights.
 Granting legal rights to apes is, of course, easy to mock -- and animal rights activists don't do themselves any favors. In media accounts, they usually come off as loopy -- whether it is Matthew's supporters insisting that ''everyone is entitled to a fair trial, even chimps,'' or Pedro Pozas, the secretary-general of the Spanish Great Ape Project, declaring ''I am an ape.''
 The animal rights movement also suffers from association with its least appealing advocates. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals constantly sets back its cause with boneheaded moves, like the ad it ran juxtaposing photos of penned-up animals with starving Jews in concentration camps. 
 Too often, animal-rights supporters seem to care about animals to the exclusion of people. Leona Helmsley epitomized this strain when she left $12 million to her dog and instructed that virtually all of her multibillion-dollar estate be used to care for dogs.
 The anti-animal rights camp, however, does not come off much better. Many base their opposition on the Bible -- specifically, the verse in Genesis granting man ''dominion'' over ''every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.'' It's hard to see why that should be interpreted as divine endorsement for using chimps in crash tests, or why, even if it were, it should guide secular law.
 Animal rights opponents often rely on tired ''slippery slope'' arguments -- that if apes have the right not to be abused, soon goldfish will be able to sue their owners for not changing the water. Even Mr. Singer, who is often branded an animal-rights extremist, says species should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. American laws -- notably the Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance and Protection Act -- already do this. 
 Much of the opposition to animal rights is really economic. The campaign against the anti-cruelty referendum that will be on the California ballot this November -- to prohibit keeping calves, hens and pigs in inhumanely small cages -- is being financed in large part by egg and meat producers.
 Strip away the goofier rhetoric of the ape-rights activists, and their claim is straightforward. Great apes are biologically very close to humans; chimps and humans share about 98 percent of their DNA. Apes have complex communication skills and close emotional bonds. They experience loneliness and sorrow. They deserve some respect.
 It sounds odd to say that apes have rights -- or to call a chimpanzee a ''person.'' As a legal matter, though, it is not such a stretch. People in irreversible comas have rights. Even corporations are recognized as ''persons,'' with free speech and equal protection rights, and the ability to sue and be sued.
 If apes are given rights, they are not going to get the same ones as humans -- just rights that are deemed appropriate to their status. Matthew's supporters are trying to have him declared a person because his animal sanctuary has had financial trouble, and they want him to be able to accept donations for his own support. It's hard to see the harm in that.
 Critics object that recognizing rights for apes would diminish human beings. But it seems more likely that showing respect for apes would elevate humans at the same time. 
 American law is becoming increasingly cruel. The Supreme Court recently ruled that states are not obliged to administer lethal injections in ways that avoid unnecessary risk that inmates will suffer great pain. If apes are given the right to humane treatment, it just might become harder to deny that same right to their human cousins.

HEADLINE: Bistro Where the Chef Is Everyone's Grand-mere

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Oui, there will be tricolor bunting. Balloons? Certainement. And when ''La Marseillaise'' is played, diners will be asked to stand. But here is the surprise about Monday evening's celebration of Bastille Day at Chez Napoleon, the diminutive, cozy, venerable Manhattan bastion of La Belle France at 365 West 50th Street: The bistro will be open.
 ''Normally, we are closed Mondays in the summer,'' said Marguerite Bruno, 87, whom everyone calls ''Chef Grand-mere.'' 
 Already, across the city, there have been grand Francophilic celebrations of vin and fromage, cutthroat petanque competitions and even a Web site, bastilledaynyc.com, that coordinated all the hoopla for an annual street fete on Sunday on East 60th Street from Fifth to Lexington Avenues. 
 But here, ''there are no parades; it is not the same as in France,'' Ms. Bruno said, brown eyes bright with remembrance. ''Ah, the public balls. Right in the streets.'' 
 For at least a decade after her grandson nailed it to the wall, a small sign near the kitchen of the family-owned restaurant between Eighth and Ninth Avenues proclaimed: ''If Mama Ain't Happy, Ain't Nobody Happy.'' (The sign is now in storage, thanks to wallpapering in progress.) 
 The mama in question is, of course, the matriarch of this 44-seat, white-tablecloth universe of chunky pate, blood sausage and frog legs laced with garlic. 
 ''Everywhere there is nouvelle, but here there is French tradition,'' said Rene Morel, 76, a violin restorer from Manhattan and a Chez Napoleon loyalist who said he was ''too old to remember'' when he began coming there. 
 He was discussing the 1715 Stradivarius played by his luncheon companion, the globe-trotting violinist Rony Rogoff, 62, who was attacking the artichoke vinaigrette appetizer on a recent afternoon. ''When I'm here,'' Mr. Rogoff said, ''I think I'm eating at Grandma's.'' 
 And he is. Even though she commutes to the restaurant from Bellerose, Queens, ''This is my home,'' Ms. Bruno said. 
 It would be difficult to make the case that this unassuming, doughty, 48-year-old trouper is the very soul of France on American soil, but the restaurant is certainly an increasingly rare remnant, a survivor from the lost legion of French bistros on the West Side of Midtown.
 ''This is French territory,'' Ms. Bruno said. 
 It has outlived the departure of the old Madison Square Garden, the disrupting construction of Worldwide Plaza up the street, the post-9/11 economic slump and anti-French sentiment, Broadway strikes and the transformation of Hell's Kitchen to Hell's Breakfast Nook and its rising rents. 
 And because of French restaurant attrition, Chez Napoleon is now the northern bookend in the Theater District to that other, southerly, Chez: the indefatigable Chez Josephine, a French outpost at 414 West 42nd Street. 
 But compared with the latter's oft-venturesome cuisine, Chez Napoleon is so old-school that ''sometimes I ask tourists from France why they would want to come here, when they could go anywhere,'' said Ms. Bruno's 36-year-old grandson, William Welles, who holds forth behind the postage stamp of a bar. ''They say it is getting hard to find this traditional, home-style fare in France.''
 Grand-mere has always done the cooking, but these days, though she still stirs the sauce, she has yielded much of the heavy lifting to her sous-chef, Carlos Cisneros, 45, who has worked with her for 15 years.
 This is a kitchen overseen by a grandmother who was taught in turn by her grandmother Julienne Meignen, ''and also my aunt, Marie Ribon,'' she said. 
 And in 1943, in the German-French border town Saarbrucken, it was Ms. Bruno and her aunt who gave some bread and other morsels to an underfed French prisoner, Alfred Bruno, who was toiling in a Nazi work camp. A year later, Ms. Bruno surreptitiously opened the barbed wire at the camp, she said, to permit his escape to Metz. 
 They were married in 1945, but no film for the camera was to be had, so their wedding picture could not be taken until later that year. It now hangs on the restaurant wall, and Marguerite's welcoming face is just the same as it is now, save for a timeworn resemblance to the actresses Simone Signoret and Isabelle Huppert. 
 For nine years, Marguerite and Alfred operated L'Hotel du Puy, a hotel-restaurant in Auron, a ski town in the foothills of the Alps. But since the Brunos were unable to buy the property, and the French economy was crashing, ''we decided to come to America,'' said Ms. Bruno, who spoke in English and French, with translation by her grandson and her daughter, Elyane, 61, who runs Chez Napoleon and usually answers the phone. 
 The Brunos arrived in New York in 1975 and opened a restaurant, L'Esterel, at 58th Street and First Avenue; it closed, and Ms. Bruno cooked in several places before buying the tiny, tidy, busy kitchen at Chez Napoleon in 1982.
 ''It is so hard to keep our prices reasonable, as the cost of meat and fish go up and up,'' Ms. Bruno said. The restaurant, like so many other old-timers, is trying to negotiate a new lease for next year. ''Rents are a problem for all of us,'' she said. 
 On the walls are reproduction French flintlocks, a battered trumpet, a map of Paris in 1578 and Napoleonic murals, some painted by Mr. Bruno, who died in 1992. There are also framed jigsaw puzzles (the restaurant sells a ''menu'' of puzzles with designs ranging from paintings by Monet to the ocean liner Normandie, from $17 to $22).
 And in one of the two mini dining rooms is a framed facsimile of the Little Corporal's renowned 1821 letter to the French before his death. ''People ask if it is real,'' Ms. Bruno said. ''If it were real, would we have it on the wall?'' 
 Her daughter shook her head. ''Napoleon,'' she said, ''his handwriting was very bad.'' 
 Ms. Bruno padded from the kitchen to the bar and sat before her grandson at the lone seat. ''I only started drinking Scotch when I came to America,'' she said of her custom of sipping ''just one glass of Dewar's'' after the dinner rush. 
 ''But we are allowed,'' her grandson said fondly, ''to fill that glass again.''

HEADLINE: Where Credit Is Due

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''We Should Still Like Ike'' (Op-Ed, July 7), Jean Edward Smith is right to laud Senator Barack Obama for reaching out to evangelicals. And Democrats would do well to focus more on ''Eisenhower Republicans.'' 
 But I disagree with his statement that no 20th-century president other than Dwight D. Eisenhower can make the claim that he ''gave the nation eight years of peace and prosperity.'' 
 First, Eisenhower was in office during two separate economic recessions, in 1953 and 1957. 
 Second, Bill Clinton, who presided over the longest economic expansion in the nation's history, left office with incomes up, crime down, welfare rolls slashed, the budget in surplus and the nation essentially at peace. 
 Eisenhower deserves more credit than he sometimes receives. So does Bill Clinton.
 Al From Washington, July 9, 2008
 The writer is the founder and chief executive of the Democratic Leadership Council.

HEADLINE: Spending $1 Billion To Restore Fiscal Sanity

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Gaffes have commanded presidential campaign headlines lately, including Carleton S. Fiorina's remarks on Viagra and health insurance, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson's vulgar criticism of Senator Barack Obama. Peter G. Peterson wants people to focus on what he considers real news: the nation is going broke.
 Because he wasn't born yesterday, Mr. Peterson, co-founder of the Blackstone Group and a secretary of commerce under President Richard M. Nixon, will spend $1 billion in an effort to get the public's attention. The money, which comes from the windfall Mr. Peterson received when Blackstone went public last year, will finance a media blitz, starting with a documentary, ''I.O.U.S.A.'' 
 The film aims to startle voters and politicians alike, and summon them to the task of closing the long-term imbalance between what the government will take in and what it has promised to pay out, most notably through Social Security and Medicare.
 Mr. Peterson, 82, says he yearns for the can-do spirit that helped politicians forged by the Depression finance the G.I. Bill of Rights, the Interstate highway system and the Marshall Plan from the ashes of World War II. Yet he is uncertain of finding it through the torrent of trivia from the 21st-century politics of rapid response teams, microtargeting, cable television rants and angry bloggers.
 ''Has something fundamental happened to the character of our people or our societal structure, or has no one stepped up to provide the leadership?'' Mr. Peterson asked. ''We're not going to know that until we try.''
 Low Priority
 Budget-balancing rarely receives more than cursory attention in any campaign. It is getting even less in this one, when a weak economy has the two major-party candidates emphasizing the financial salve they would provide anxious voters.
 Mr. Obama recommends his $80 billion in tax cuts for working families and retirees, his $65 billion-a-year plan to expand access to health care coverage, and his call for a $50 billion economic stimulus package. Last week, Jason Furman, his economic policy adviser, disputed the calculation by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center that Mr. Obama had proposed a net tax increase by raising rates on affluent taxpayers; the center, Mr. Furman said, had failed to count tax credits for health care that Mr. Obama would distribute.
 Senator John McCain proposes $100 billion in new tax cuts for corporations, $65 million for individuals by doubling the personal tax exemption for dependents, and a gas tax holiday on top of the Bush tax cuts he would make permanent. Mr. McCain pledges to somehow close a budget deficit topping $400 billion, but has not specified how.
 Their emphasis is no surprise. In a recent Pew Research Center poll, the federal deficit ranked behind the economy, education, jobs, health care, energy, Social Security and Iraq among voters' priorities.
 Those rankings are precisely what Mr. Peterson hopes to change. The Web site of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation flashes a frightening fiscal fact: The looming retirement of 78 million baby boomers has generated unpaid entitlement obligations that are triple the size of the entire economy -- $175,000 for each American.
 ''We just need fiscal sanity,'' said David M. Walker, the foundation's president and a former comptroller general. He warns that looming debt will ultimately make today's housing and financial market crises seem like small change. 
 Though Mr. Peterson has endorsed Mr. McCain, his efforts to control debt are bipartisan, and he has enlisted Robert E. Rubin, President Bill Clinton's treasury secretary, to make his case. The foundation does not expect the candidates to propose comprehensive solutions while chasing votes; instead, it will pursue the more limited goal of dissuading the candidates from ruling out potential solutions.
 Money Talks
 At the center of Mr. Peterson's plan lies ''I.O.U.S.A.,'' which will be screened for the news media in Washington on Monday and opens in 400 theaters next month. Directed by Patrick Creadon, who shot ''Wordplay,'' about crossword-puzzle enthusiasts, ''I.O.U.S.A.'' hopes to give as much cachet to long-term fiscal policy as ''An Inconvenient Truth'' gave to environmentalism.
 Mr. Peterson's foundation is planning an active Internet strategy, tapping bloggers and social networks to reach young voters, who typically pay little heed to far-off fiscal obligations. In early 2009, as the new president takes office, the foundation will try to draw attention with programming on public television, and possibly television advertisements and infomercials.
 The effort resembles those of public policy advocacy groups, with a big exception: the money Mr. Peterson has put behind it. After decades in and around public life, he knows that is his only chance to make an impact.
 ''You can buy a lot of airtime'' with $1 billion, Mr. Peterson said. ''People are going to hear from us.''

HEADLINE: New Vision For Schools Proposes Broad Role

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Randi Weingarten, the New Yorker who is rising to become president of the American Federation of Teachers, says she wants to replace President Bush's focus on standardized testing with a vision of public schools as community centers that help poor students succeed by offering not only solid classroom lessons but also medical and other services.
 Ms. Weingarten, 50, is running unopposed for the presidency of the national teachers union, whose delegates at an annual convention in Chicago are expected to elect her Monday. In a speech prepared for delivery after the vote, Ms. Weingarten criticizes No Child Left Behind, President Bush's signature domestic initiative, which is defended staunchly by Margaret Spellings, the secretary of education. 
 Ms. Weingarten, saying the law ''is too badly broken to be fixed,'' lays out a ''new vision of schools for the 21st century.'' 
 ''Can you imagine a federal law that promoted community schools -- schools that serve the neediest children by bringing together under one roof all the services and activities they and their families need?'' Ms. Weingarten is expected to ask in the speech, a copy of which was provided by the union to The New York Times. 
 ''Imagine schools that are open all day and offer after-school and evening recreational activities, child care and preschool, tutoring and homework assistance,'' the speech reads. ''Schools that include dental, medical and counseling clinics.''
 By laying out that expansive vision of government's role in the public schools, Ms. Weingarten wades into a fierce debate among Democrats seeking to influence the educational program of Senator Barack Obama, their party's presumptive presidential nominee. In an interview last week, she said the ideas in the speech amounted to ''what I'd like to see in a new federal education law.'' 
 In her 10-year tenure as president of the United Federation of Teachers, which represents New York City teachers, Ms. Weingarten has defended teachers' economic interests, raising her members' salaries by 43 percent in the last five years. But she has also proved willing to accommodate the city's ideas on improving schools. She has embraced charter schools, and last year -- even as teachers unions elsewhere were opposing performance pay plans -- negotiated an arrangement in New York that gives bonuses to teachers in schools whose poor children show broad gains in test scores.
 With her move to the presidency of the national union, with 1.4 million members, Ms. Weingarten will have a broader platform from which to influence the nation's education debates. Although the federation is smaller than the country's other teachers union, the National Education Association, with its 3.2 million members, A.F.T. presidents have had an equal or larger political profile because presidential tenures in the bigger union are restricted by term limits. 
 Two previous presidents of the United Federation of Teachers, Albert Shanker and Sandra Feldman, also rose to lead the A.F.T. 
 ''My sense is that Randi Weingarten is continuing Al Shanker's tradition, clearly standing up for the interests of teachers but also trying to engage in thoughtful education reform that will be good for students,'' said Richard D. Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation whose biography of Mr. Shanker, ''Tough Liberal,'' was published this year.
 On Sunday, Mr. Obama spoke to the convention by satellite feed from California, and he mixed criticism of the No Child law with praise for teachers' contributions and an exhortation to Americans to meet the nation's responsibility to educate all children. He quoted a young Chicago teacher as telling him that she had been annoyed by a tendency ''to explain away the shortcomings and failures of our education system by saying, 'These kids can't learn.' ''
 ''These children are our children,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It's time we understood that their education is our responsibility.
 ''I am running for president to guarantee that all of our children have the best possible chance in life,'' he said, ''and I am tired of hearing you, the teachers who work so hard, blamed for our problems.''
 Convention delegates gave Mr. Obama a standing ovation.
 Ms. Weingarten takes national office with robust support of the rank and file. ''The last eight years of the Republican presidency have really been a threat to the middle class and to public education,'' said William Gallagher, a high school social studies teacher in Philadelphia for 33 years. Ms Weingarten, he said, would ''work hard to make sure the new president, whoever he is, puts education on the forefront of issues in this country.''
 In the speech Ms. Weingarten is to deliver Monday, she praises the ideas of a group of Democrats led by Tom Payzant, the former schools superintendent in Boston, who have argued that schools alone cannot close achievement gaps rooted in larger economic inequalities, and that ''broader, bolder'' measures are needed, like publicly financed early childhood education and health services for the poor. 
 Another group, headed by the Rev. Al Sharpton and Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein of New York, issued a manifesto last month urging the nation to redouble its efforts to close the achievement gap separating poor students from affluent ones and blaming ''teachers' contracts'' for keeping ineffective teachers in classrooms.
 Of the vision of Mr. Payzant's group, Ms. Weingarten's speech says, ''Sisters and brothers, this is an idea whose time has come. 
 ''Imagine if schools had the educational resources children need to thrive, like smaller classes and individualized instruction, plentiful, up-to-date materials and technology anchored to that rich curriculum, decent facilities, an early start for toddlers and a nurturing atmosphere,'' she says.
 Ms. Weingarten, whose mother was a teacher in Nyack, N.Y., is a lawyer who was union counsel during the 1980s and 1990s. In the last decade, Ms. Weingarten taught high school history for six years in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. 
 In the interview, she said: ''We all have to work tenaciously to eliminate the achievement gap and to turn around low-performing schools. But the folks who believe that this can all be done on teachers' shoulders, which is what No Child tries to do, are doing a huge disservice to America.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Look to Lobbyist to Finance a Convention

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

DATELINE: In terms of lobbyists, few are more connected 

 BODY:
-- both west of the Mississippi and in the corridors of power in Washington -- than Steve Farber, a Denver lawyer whose political contacts have thrust him into a central fund-raising role for the Democratic National Convention. 
 Mr. Farber's vast contact list could prove crucial in raising the millions of dollars needed by the Denver host committee to showcase Senator Barack Obama and the Democratic Party in August in Denver. But Mr. Farber's activities are a public display of how corporate connections fuel politics -- exactly the type of special influence that Mr. Obama had pledged to expunge from politics when he said he would not accept donations from lobbyists. 
 For two years now, Mr. Farber has parlayed his love for Denver and his ability to call on a network of lobbying clients to help him with the daunting task of raising the $40 million, or more, that Democrats need to run their convention. As the host committee's chief fund-raiser, he is on the phone 10, 20 times a day, twisting arms and cajoling potential donors -- a task made more difficult by the fact that Denver has few hometown companies with enough resources to help foot the bills. 
 Yet, as Mr. Farber hops on planes, hosts breakfasts and pulls out the stops, he at least can draw on the resources of his law firm, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, one of the fastest-growing lobbying shops in Washington and one of the most powerful firms in the West, thanks to some recent strategic mergers that have only fattened his roster of blue-chip corporate clients. 
 ''Steve Farber is involved with a lot of high-level candidates and ones who have won,'' said Floyd Ciruli, head of Ciruli Associates, a Denver political consulting firm. ''He's famous for hiring ex-politicians, their children and ex-judges. He's very good at making connections with people who have access to politicians.''
 Mr. Farber is a golfing buddy of former President Bill Clinton, and has raised money for the Clinton Presidential Library. In return, Mr. Clinton came to nearby Aurora, Colo., to speak to businessmen at the request of Mr. Farber. Members of Mr. Farber's firm have donated around $1.1 million to candidates, parties and political action committees since 2005, with the majority going to Democrats. And Mr. Farber chaired former Gov. Roy Romer's winning campaigns in Colorado.
 But his efforts to raise money for the Denver convention have been marred by missed deadlines as Mr. Farber has struggled to get corporations and wealthy individuals to open their wallets in a shaky economy. And Mr. Obama last week added to the challenge, with his campaign saying the candidate would give his acceptance speech outside the convention hall, distancing himself from party insiders, donors and corporate leaders who typically dominate convention week.
 In raising money for the convention, Mr. Farber said he was not selling access to the many politicians attending the event, but promoting regional pride and the chance to participate in a historical event. 
 ''We're selling a convention and we're selling a chance to showcase Denver as a great area,'' Mr. Farber said. ''If corporate America wants to be a part of it, we welcome them as partners. It's a question of becoming part of history.'' 
 As a result of Mr. Farber's efforts, dozens of organizations have signed up as corporate sponsors of the Denver convention, including six that are lobbying clients of his firm: UnitedHealth Group, AT&T, Comcast, the National Association of Home Builders, Western Union and Google. In return for these donations, which can go up to $1 million or more, sponsors are promised prominent display space for corporate marketing and access to elected officials and Democratic leaders at a large number of parties and receptions. 
 Mr. Farber is now going through his client list -- and also approaching nonclients -- in his search for cash. Conventions are one of the last remaining ways for corporations to put big money into politics, since they are banned from giving directly to candidates and parties. 
 Even more, corporations can give unlimited amounts of money to host committees, in contrast to individuals who are restricted in the size of their political donations. Corporations can also take a tax deduction on their donations to the host committee, but individuals are barred from deducting political contributions. 
 ''Farber has a dual role,'' said Steve Weissman, a policy analyst at the Campaign Finance Institute who has studied convention finances. ''He is a businessman and a community activist, and yet he is connected to a law firm that is one of the biggest in Washington. When any of Steve Farber's clients have a problem, federal elected officials will feel obligated to listen to him if he approaches them later on federal policy interests.'' 
 Although he is a Democrat, Mr. Farber's firm draws political talent from both sides of the aisle. Its lobbyists include Jim Nicholson, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee; former Senator Hank Brown, Republican of Colorado; and Judy Black, wife of Charlie Black, Senator John McCain's chief adviser, and a major bundler of donations for Mr. McCain. 
 Others who have passed through the doors at his firm include two former cabinet secretaries: Gale Norton, interior secretary in the Bush administration, and Federico F. Pena, transportation secretary in the Clinton administration. Mr. Farber's firm also represents the former Liggett tobacco company and a trade group seeking to retain tax breaks for wealthy hedge fund investors.
 Most recently, Mr. Farber's firm joined forces, through mergers, with the leading law firm in Las Vegas representing gambling companies and the leading firm in Los Angeles representing water interests. 
 ''I have my list of companies, not only my client list, but companies throughout Colorado and the Rocky Mountain region,'' Mr. Farber said in a telephone interview. ''We've got offices in Las Vegas and California, so I have clients that we can contact, and I have friends of clients that I intend to contact. And if they have given to the convention already, I try to get them to double their contribution.'' 
 Mr. Obama's well-publicized statements denouncing special interest money have done little to dampen Mr. Farber's efforts. In Mr. Farber's view, money to the convention -- an issue Mr. Obama has not addressed directly -- is different from money to the candidates themselves. 
 ''The money to the convention doesn't go to the candidates or the Democratic National Committee, but to the host committee to pay for the cost of the convention,'' Mr. Farber said. ''So what he has said doesn't inhibit it.'' 
 In fact, given the struggle that Mr. Farber has had -- the host committee is $11 million short of its fund-raising goal -- he could welcome a helping hand from the Obama campaign, which, so far, has been more focused on raising money for Mr. Obama, the party and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton than for the convention. 
 ''The Obama campaign has been unbelievable in their ability to fund-raise,'' Mr. Farber said. ''So if they can encourage their supporters to send money to the host committee, it would be helpful.'' 
 Mr. Farber said he was not working with the Obama campaign. ''They have a list of contributors and could suggest that we contact come of those people, people they could ask to help with the convention,'' he said. 
 In the absence of that help, Mr. Farber said he was ''still talking to the corporate community.'' 
 ''What I am now selling is Senator Obama and the excitement he has created in his candidacy,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Troops in Afghanistan Need Help, Obama Says

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama is proposing that the United States deploy about 10,000 more troops to battle resurgent forces in Afghanistan, a plan intended to shift the American military focus from the Iraq war to the marked rise in violence from the Taliban.
 ''As president, I would pursue a new strategy, and begin by providing at least two additional combat brigades to support our effort in Afghanistan,'' Mr. Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, wrote in an Op-Ed article published on Monday in The New York Times. ''We need more troops, more helicopters, better intelligence-gathering and more nonmilitary assistance to accomplish the mission there.''
 Mr. Obama, who is among those who maintain that Afghanistan has been neglected because of the administration's Iraq policy, has not previously offered such a specific plan for how to strengthen troop levels in Afghanistan. His proposal comes as he prepares to visit American commanders to assess progress in Iraq and needs in Afghanistan.
 He said a new round of violence on Sunday, in which nine American soldiers died in fierce fighting with the Taliban in eastern Afghanistan, underscored the military challenges ahead for the United States. He said in a news conference here, ''It's very hard for us to bolster our forces in Afghanistan when we have such a heavy presence in Iraq.'' 
 As the Bush administration considers withdrawing additional combat troops from Iraq in September, the military needs in Afghanistan are coming into sharper focus. Mr. Obama and other Democrats have said the balance of troops in the two war zones should be adjusted. At the same time, a downturn in Iraqi violence has complicated their arguments that a surge of American troops was flawed.
 ''I continue to believe that we're under-resourced in Afghanistan,'' Mr. Obama said on Sunday, speaking to reporters after addressing a Latino group here. ''That is the real center for terrorist activity that we have to deal with and deal with aggressively.''
 Later this summer, at a date that is not being disclosed for security reasons, Mr. Obama said he would be joined on a trip to Iraq, and possibly Afghanistan, by Senators Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, and Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island. All three senators share critical views of the administration's Iraq policy.
 The visit to Iraq, and his findings from briefings with military commanders, represents an important moment for Mr. Obama's general election candidacy. While he said he still supports removing American combat troops within 16 months, he has struggled to explain how he would balance that plan if conditions on the ground were not suitable for that goal.
 He said he was not going to Iraq to promote his withdrawal plan but to gather facts.
 ''We have one president at a time, so I'm not going to be traveling to negotiate anything or make promises,'' Mr. Obama told reporters aboard his campaign plane on Saturday evening. ''I am there to listen, but there is no doubt that my core position, which is that we need a timetable for withdrawal, not only to relieve pressure on our military, but also to deal with the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan and to put more pressure on the Iraqi government.''
 Several Democratic supporters have criticized Mr. Obama for what they believe is a shift to the political center on a variety of issues, including the Iraq war. He addresses his critics and seeks to make clear in his Op-Ed essay for The Times that his goal to end the war, a central selling point of his primary campaign, has not changed. 
 ''On my first day in office, I would give the military a new mission: ending this war,'' Mr. Obama wrote, adding: ''Ending the war is essential to meeting our broader strategic goals, starting in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the Taliban is resurgent and Al Qaeda has a safe haven. Iraq is not the central front in the war on terrorism, and it never has been.''
 Senator John McCain, the likely Republican nominee, did not campaign on Sunday. But in a visit to his Southwest regional campaign headquarters in Phoenix he brought up the nine deaths in Afghanistan, describing the violence there and the downturn in the American economy, as ''difficult times'' and ''great challenges,'' according to a pool report.
 Mr. Obama has not visited Iraq since his first trip there in January 2006, which Mr. McCain and Republicans have used to suggest that he is not sufficiently aware of the military progress that has been made. Mr. McCain has been to Iraq at least eight times. Asked about the criticism on Sunday, Mr. Obama grew defensive.
 ''John McCain has been in Congress 25 years -- no doubt about that -- if this is a longevity measure, then John McCain wins,'' Mr. Obama said. ''On the other hand, before we went into Iraq, I knew the difference between Shia and Sunni.''
 The comment referred to a misstatement by Mr. McCain earlier this year, when he struggled to explain the distinction between the majority and minority ethnic groups in Iraq. On Sunday, a spokesman for Mr. McCain criticized Mr. Obama's trip, suggesting that he is not entering it with an open mind to progress that has been made by the American forces.
 ''If Barack Obama believes that visiting Iraq and meeting with commanders will not give him any new perspective, then we can only assume he's going just to smile for the cameras,'' said Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for Mr. McCain.
 Cover Called 'Tasteless'
 SAN DIEGO -- As he flies around the country, Mr. Obama has a fondness for magazines. The New Yorker is often among the titles at the front of his campaign plane.
 This week's issue, though, is not likely to be on board.
 The cover of the magazine depicts Mr. Obama wearing a turban, while he offers a fist bump to his gun-toting wife. An American flag singes behind them in the fireplace. 
 Asked about the drawing at a news conference here Sunday, Mr. Obama held his tongue, saying, ''I have no response to that.'' A campaign spokesman, Bill Burton, was not so measured. 
 ''The New Yorker may think, as one of their staff explained to us, that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature Senator Obama's right-wing critics have tried to create,'' Mr. Burton said in a statement. ''But most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive -- and we agree.''
 The cover of the July 21 issue is titled ''The Politics of Fear.'' A news release to promote the magazine said the artist, Barry Blitt, ''satirizes the use of scare tactics and misinformation in the presidential election to derail Barack Obama's campaign.''

HEADLINE: Fannie, Freddie and You

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
And now we've reached the next stage of our seemingly never-ending financial crisis. This time Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are in the headlines, with dire warnings of imminent collapse. How worried should we be?
Well, I'm going to take a contrarian position: the storm over these particular lenders is overblown. Fannie and Freddie probably will need a government rescue. But since it's already clear that that rescue will take place, their problems won't take down the economy.
Furthermore, while Fannie and Freddie are problematic institutions, they aren't responsible for the mess we're in. 
Here's the background: Fannie Mae -- the Federal National Mortgage Association -- was created in the 1930s to facilitate homeownership by buying mortgages from banks, freeing up cash that could be used to make new loans. Fannie and Freddie Mac, which does pretty much the same thing, now finance most of the home loans being made in America.
The case against Fannie and Freddie begins with their peculiar status: although they're private companies with stockholders and profits, they're ''government-sponsored enterprises'' established by federal law, which means that they receive special privileges.
The most important of these privileges is implicit: it's the belief of investors that if Fannie and Freddie are threatened with failure, the federal government will come to their rescue.
This implicit guarantee means that profits are privatized but losses are socialized. If Fannie and Freddie do well, their stockholders reap the benefits, but if things go badly, Washington picks up the tab. Heads they win, tails we lose.
Such one-way bets can encourage the taking of bad risks, because the downside is someone else's problem. The classic example of how this can happen is the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s: S.& L. owners offered high interest rates to attract lots of federally insured deposits, then essentially gambled with the money. When many of their bets went bad, the feds ended up holding the bag. The eventual cleanup cost taxpayers more than $100 billion.
But here's the thing: Fannie and Freddie had nothing to do with the explosion of high-risk lending a few years ago, an explosion that dwarfed the S.& L. fiasco. In fact, Fannie and Freddie, after growing rapidly in the 1990s, largely faded from the scene during the height of the housing bubble.
Partly that's because regulators, responding to accounting scandals at the companies, placed temporary restraints on both Fannie and Freddie that curtailed their lending just as housing prices were really taking off. Also, they didn't do any subprime lending, because they can't: the definition of a subprime loan is precisely a loan that doesn't meet the requirement, imposed by law, that Fannie and Freddie buy only mortgages issued to borrowers who made substantial down payments and carefully documented their income.
So whatever bad incentives the implicit federal guarantee creates have been offset by the fact that Fannie and Freddie were and are tightly regulated with regard to the risks they can take. You could say that the Fannie-Freddie experience shows that regulation works.
In that case, however, how did they end up in trouble?
Part of the answer is the sheer scale of the housing bubble, and the size of the price declines taking place now that the bubble has burst. In Los Angeles, Miami and other places, anyone who borrowed to buy a house at the peak of the market probably has negative equity at this point, even if he or she originally put 20 percent down. The result is a rising rate of delinquency even on loans that meet Fannie-Freddie guidelines.
Also, Fannie and Freddie, while tightly regulated in terms of their lending, haven't been required to put up enough capital -- that is, money raised by selling stock rather than borrowing. This means that even a small decline in the value of their assets can leave them underwater, owing more than they own.
And yes, there is a real political scandal here: there have been repeated warnings that Fannie's and Freddie's thin capitalization posed risks to taxpayers, but the companies' management bought off the political process, systematically hiring influential figures from both parties. While they were ugly, however, Fannie's and Freddie's political machinations didn't play a significant role in causing our current problems.
Still, isn't it shocking that taxpayers may end up having to rescue these institutions? Not really. We're going through a major financial crisis -- and such crises almost always end with some kind of taxpayer bailout for the banking system.
And let's be clear: Fannie and Freddie can't be allowed to fail. With the collapse of subprime lending, they're now more central than ever to the housing market, and the economy as a whole.

HEADLINE: TREASURY UNVEILS VAST PLAN TO SAVE MORTGAGE GIANTS

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; Reporting was contributed by Jenny Anderson and Gretchen Morgenson from New York; Charles Duhigg from Macatawa, Mich.; and David Herszhenhorn and Carl Hulse from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Alarmed by the sharply eroding confidence in the nation's two largest mortgage finance companies, the Bush administration on Sunday asked Congress to approve a sweeping rescue package that would give officials the power to inject billions of federal dollars into the beleaguered companies through investments and loans.
In a separate announcement, the Federal Reserve said it would make one of its short-term lending programs available to the two companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Fed said that it had made its decision ''to promote the availability of home mortgage credit during a period of stress in financial markets.''
An official said that the Fed's decision to permit the companies to borrow from its so-called discount window was approved at the request of the Treasury but that it was temporary and would probably end once Congress approved Treasury's plan. Some officials briefed on the plan said Congress could be asked to extend the total line of credit to the institutions to $300 billion. 
The actions, which taken together could provide an overwhelming surge of capital to the companies, were the second time in four months that the housing crisis had prompted the government to scramble over a weekend to rescue a major financial institution. Last March, the Treasury Department engineered the sale of Bear Stearns to prevent it from going into bankruptcy and cause a shock to the financial system.
The plan was disclosed on Sunday evening to calm jittery markets overseas and on Wall Street in advance of a debt sale by Freddie Mac on Monday morning. Officials said that after talking to senior lawmakers through the weekend, they expected that Congress would attach the proposals to a housing bill that could be completed and sent to the White House for approval as early as this week.
''The president has asked me to work with Congress to act on this plan immediately,'' the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., said Sunday on the steps of the Treasury building. ''Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a central role in our housing finance system and must continue to do so in their current form as shareholder-owned companies. Their support for the housing market is particularly important as we work through the current housing correction.''
While senior Democratic and Republican officials in successive administrations have for many years repeatedly denied that the trillions of dollars of debt Fannie and Freddie issued is guaranteed, the package, if adopted, would bring the Treasury closer than ever to exposing taxpayers to potentially huge new liabilities. The two companies could face significant new losses this year as the wave of housing foreclosures continues. Officials seemed to suggest, however, that they had little choice but to intervene.
Over the weekend, Treasury officials sought assurances from Wall Street firms that the $3 billion auction by Freddie Mac of short-term debt would go off without a hitch. While $3 billion is a relatively small sum for an institution of Freddie's size officials said they did not want to risk even a small misstep that could set off a new round of problems.
The government officials said that the more drastic alternative that has been considered -- placing one or both companies under the control of a government-appointed conservator -- would be done only as a last-ditch measure if the intermediate steps failed to restore confidence. The failure of just one of the companies could be catastrophic for economies around the world.
The officials said they were prompted to act because, despite repeated assurances by top officials that the companies had adequate cash to weather the current financial storm, Fannie and Freddie suffered a withering blow of confidence last week when their stocks plummeted on the New York Stock Exchange. As a result, Freddie faced an uncertain debt offering on Monday.
The companies, known as government-sponsored enterprises, or G.S.E.'s, touch nearly half of the nation's mortgages by either owning or guaranteeing them, and the debt securities they issue to finance their operations are widely owned by foreign governments, pension funds, mutual funds, big companies and other large institutional investors.
''G.S.E. debt is held by financial institutions around the world,'' Mr. Paulson said in his statement. ''Its continued strength is important to maintaining confidence and stability in our financial system and our financial markets. Therefore we must take steps to address the current situation as we move to a stronger regulatory structure.''
The proposal would give the Treasury secretary authority to determine when to invest in the companies or extend loans to them. Those purchases would be made with the agreement of the companies.
Officials said the proposed investment and lending elements of the plan were to last two years.
While the Treasury did not specify the size of the packages, officials briefed on the plan said they were told by administration officials that, to be meaningful, Congress should consider extending the line of credit to the two institutions to $300 billion.
Each company now has a $2.25 billion credit line, set nearly 40 years ago by Congress. At the time, Fannie had only about $15 billion in outstanding debt. It now has total debt of about $800 billion, while Freddie has about $740 billion. Today the two companies also hold or guarantee loans valued at more than $5 trillion, about half the nation's mortgages.
Lawmakers said that as part of the plan, the administration called on Congress to raise the national debt limit. And it asked Congress to give the Federal Reserve a role in setting the rules for how big a capital cushion each company must hold. Giving the Fed a consulting role in the companies' oversight is seen as another way to reassure markets.
Initial reaction to the plan by some Congressional Democrats was positive.
An early endorsement came from Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who is also a senior member of the banking committee.
''The Treasury's plan is surgical and carefully thought out and will maximize confidence in Fannie and Freddie while minimizing potential costs to U.S. taxpayers,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''While Fannie and Freddie still have solid fundamentals, it will be reassuring to investors, bondholders and mortgage-holders that the federal government will be behind these agencies should it be needed.''
Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, and one of the authors of the housing legislation, said he supported the Treasury proposal. He said he expected the plan would be included in the housing bill, which he said would be approved, sent back to the Senate and likely land on the president's desk by the end of the week.
''The general thrust of what they're doing is right,'' said Mr. Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, told reporters in San Diego on Sunday that any government action to rescue the two mortgage companies should be done from the perspective of homeowners, ''not just shareholders and investors and C.E.O.'s of companies.''
His presumed Republican opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona, said last week that he expected the government would do all it could to prevent the failure of either company.
The administration's announcement was made after senior officials from the Treasury and the Federal Reserve spent Saturday and Sunday closely monitoring preparations by Freddie Mac to raise money to help meet its short-term financing needs. Officials said they were watching to see if the steep declines last week of Freddie and Fannie stock would spill into the debt market and undermine the confidence of lenders.
A senior official said that the administration had been receiving mixed signals from Wall Street about the Monday auction. But other officials denied that the prospect of a weak debt offering had motivated the Treasury to rush out its rescue plan.
''There is nothing that motivated us to act tonight that changed from Friday night,'' said a Treasury official. ''There has been no further deterioration in the markets.''
Daniel H. Mudd, the president and chief executive of Fannie Mae, said the company ''appreciates today's announcements and the expressions of support.''
''We continue to hold more than adequate capital reserves and maintain access to liquidity from the capital markets,'' Mr. Mudd said. ''Given the market turmoil, having options to access provisional sources of liquidity if needed will help to strengthen overall confidence in the market.''
Richard F. Syron, chief executive of Freddie Mac, said, ''This affirmation of the important role of the G.S.E.'s, and that we should continue to operate as shareholder-owned companies, should go a long way toward reassuring world markets that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae will continue to support America's homebuyers and renters.''
On the prospect that the government could buy shares, Sharon J. McHale, a spokeswoman for Freddie Mac, said, ''It's important to note that our understanding with Treasury is that any agreement to purchase equity can only occur with the mutual agreement of both parties.''

SUDANESE PROTEST WAR CRIMES AGAINST THEIR PRESIDENT
Thousands of people took to the streets of Khartoum, Sudan, as part of a carefully choreographed protest against the expected request by the International Criminal Court to arrest President Omar Hassan al-Bashir on war crimes charges. But many in diplomatic circles worry that bringing charges against Mr. Bashir could jeopardize peacekeeping efforts in Darfur and undermine attempts to find a political settlement to end the crisis.

IS JAPANESE BUDDHISM DYING OUT?
Japanese Buddhism has been a mainstay of elaborate and lucrative funeral services in the country. But more Japanese are opting for funeral homes or forgoing funerals, the religion's rural strongholds continue to lose population, and interest in urban areas is waning -- putting the future of Japanese Buddhism at risk. ''If Japanese Buddhism doesn't act now, it will die out,'' a priest at a Japanese temple said. ''We can't afford to wait. We have to do something.'' PAGE A6 
SUSPECT CHARGED IN ISTANBUL ATTACK
One of the suspects detained in connection with the armed attack on the United States Consulate in Istanbul last week in which three gunmen and three policemen were killed was formally charged with membership in an illegal organization, according to a semiofficial news agency. Two other suspects were released on their own recognizance. The news agency did not detail the charges, but people released on their own recognizance are generally accused of minor offenses. PAGE A7
CAFES FOR ONE SHORT SEASON
Summers in Russia are short, and so the sidewalk cafes that pop up for those precious, relatively warm weeks do brisk business. The days are often sunny, but not hot, in Moscow, and summer nights are long, with sunset lingering past 10:30 p.m. -- ideal for leisurely enjoying the outdoors.

In the kind of creative rehabilitation that sounds like something Sherriff Andy Taylor might have come up with, teenage offenders at Rhode Island's juvenile detention center are restoring four vintage diners that have been brought there by preservationists for the New Hope Diner Project. This fall, when the first restored diner is expected to open, some of the teenagers will be manning griddles and the cash register, and even preparing to someday manage the restaurant. PAGE A11

Pete Peterson plans to spend $1 billion (yes, you read that right) to get people to focus on what he considers real news: the fact that the nation is going broke. Mr. Peterson, 82, who picked up that spare billion when the Wall Street powerhouse Blackstone Group went public last year, says he yearns for the can-do spirit that politicians used to display.

EBAY DEAL WITH BUY.COM ANGERS SMALLER SELLERS
A deal by eBay allowing the Web retailer Buy.com to sell millions of books, DVDs, electronics and other items without paying the full complement of eBay fees has created bitterness among eBay's smaller sellers, some of whom depend on the site for their livelihood.

AMERICAN NAME, BUT INDIAN FLAVOR
Indian versions of Vogue, Rolling Stone and People magazines have joined familiar names like Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping and Reader's Digest, with page after page of ads designed to entice.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are in the headlines, with dire warnings of imminent collapse. But the storm over these particular lenders is overblown. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac probably will need a government rescue. But since it's already clear that that rescue will take place, their problems won't take down the economy. And while Fannie and Freddie are problematic institutions, they aren't responsible for the financial crisis we're in. PAGE A17

HEADLINE: Analysts Say More Banks Will Fail

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY; Eric Dash contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As home prices continue to decline and loan defaults mount, federal regulators are bracing for dozens of American banks to fail over the next year. 
 But after a large mortgage lender in California collapsed late Friday, Wall Street analysts began posing two crucial questions: Just how many banks might falter? And, more urgently, which one could be next?
 The nation's banks are in far less danger than they were in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when more than 1,000 federally insured institutions went under during the savings-and-loan crisis. The debacle, the greatest collapse of American financial institutions since the Depression, prompted a government bailout that cost taxpayers about $125 billion. 
 But the troubles are growing so rapidly at some small and midsize banks that as many as 150 out of the 7,500 banks nationwide could fail over the next 12 to 18 months, analysts say. Other lenders are likely to shut branches or seek mergers.
 ''Everybody is drawing up lists, trying to figure out who the next bank is, No. 1, and No. 2, how many of them are there,'' said Richard X. Bove, the banking analyst with Ladenburg Thalmann, who released a list of troubled banks over the weekend. ''And No. 3, from the standpoint of Washington, how badly is it going to affect the economy?'' 
 Many investors are on edge after federal regulators seized the California lender, IndyMac Bank, one of the nation's largest savings and loans, last week. With $32 billion in assets, IndyMac, a spinoff of the Countrywide Financial Corporation, was the biggest American lender to fail in more than two decades. 
 Now, as the Bush administration grapples with the crisis at the nation's two largest mortgage finance companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a rush of earnings reports in the coming days and weeks from some of the nation's largest financial companies are likely to provide more gloomy reminders about the sorry state of the industry.
 The future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is vital to the banks, savings and loans and credit unions, which own $1.3 trillion of securities issued or guaranteed by the two mortgage companies. If the mortgage giants ever defaulted on those obligations, banks might be forced to raise billions of dollars in additional capital.
 The large institutions set to report results this week, including Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, are in no danger of failing, but some are expected to report more multibillion-dollar write-offs. 
 But time may be running out for some small and midsize lenders. They vary in size and location, but their common woe is the collapsed real estate market and souring mortgage loans. Most of these banks are far smaller than the industry giants that have drawn so much scrutiny from regulators and investors.
 Still, only six lenders have failed so far this year, including IndyMac. In 1994, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation listed 575 banks that it considered to be troubled. As of this spring, the agency was worried about just 90 banks. That number may go up in August, when the government releases an updated list. 
 ''Failed banks are a lagging indicator, not a leading indicator,'' said William Isaac, who was chairman of the F.D.I.C. in the early 1980s and is now the chairman of the Secura Group, a finance consulting firm in Virginia. ''So you will see more troubled, more failed banks this year.'' 
 And yet IndyMac, one of the nation's largest mortgage lenders, was not on the government's troubled bank list this spring -- an indication that other troubled banks may be below the radar.
 The F.D.I.C. has $53 billion set aside to reimburse consumers for deposits lost at failed banks. IndyMac will eat up $4 billion to $8 billion of that fund, the agency estimates, and that could force it to raise more money from the banks that it insures. 
 The agency does not disclose which banks it thinks are troubled. But analysts are circulating their own lists, and short sellers -- investors who bet against stocks -- are piling on. In recent weeks, the share prices of some regional banks, like the BankUnited Financial Corporation, in Florida, and the Downey Financial Corporation, in California, have stumbled hard amid concern about their financial health. A BankUnited spokeswoman said the lender had largely avoided risky subprime loans. 
 In his ''Who Is Next?'' report over the weekend, Mr. Bove listed the fraction of loans at banks that are nonperforming, meaning, for example, that the assets have been foreclosed on or that payments are 90 days past due. He came up with what he called a danger zone, which was a percentage above 5 percent. Seven banks fell in this category.
 An important issue for the regional and community banks will be whether they have managed to sell their riskiest loans to Wall Street firms. 
 And the government may have fewer failures than in the past because private investment funds might buy some troubled lenders. Regulators are considering rule changes that would allow private equity firms to buy larger shares of banks, and several prominent investors, like Wilbur Ross, have raised funds to leap in.

An article on July 14 about the potential for bank failures as a result of the credit squeeze misstated the number of banks that have failed so far this year. It is five, not six.

HEADLINE: New York Extends Benefits For Jobless

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN; Jason Grant contributed reporting.

 BODY:
New York State began notifying out-of-work residents on Monday that they may be eligible to collect an additional 13 weeks of unemployment checks. All told, the extended benefits could go to more than 250,000 New Yorkers, the state labor commissioner said on Monday.
 The commissioner, M. Patricia Smith, said the Labor Department would send notices to residents who are eligible for an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits under an extension President Bush signed on June 30. Ms. Smith said 112,000 potential recipients, or about 43 percent of those eligible in the state, live in New York City. 
 Ms. Smith estimated that the additional checks would spur more than $850 million in spending -- on rent, food and other necessities -- in the state, over the course of the extension, which expires in March. 
 Some out-of-work New Yorkers, like Donna Faiella of Howard Beach, Queens, are not waiting to be invited to apply for more benefits.
 Ms. Faiella, 51, an editor of television commercials, said she applied online Monday morning for the extended benefits and hoped to receive her first check by the end of the week. She is expecting to receive $405 a week, which is the maximum benefit in the state, with no taxes deducted.
 She cashed the last of her 26 checks -- the limit before the extension -- in March and has been living off savings since then, she said.
 ''I've had zero income for a while,'' Ms. Faiella said. ''I can't even find a $10-an-hour job doing anything full time.''
 She said that after she was laid off by a big advertising agency last year, she stretched her 26 checks over 40 weeks because she was able to find freelance jobs along the way. She applied for a state training grant to help her adapt to the shift to digital production, which has made her skills in analog video less useful, but her application was denied, she said. Now she simply hopes to find full-time work before the additional 13 checks run out.
 Andrew Stettner, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project, said the need for the extension was especially high in New York. On average, New York beneficiaries collect unemployment for about 17 weeks, longer than all but five states, he said.
 ''New York historically has been one of the hardest places to find work,'' Mr. Stettner said. Referring to the May increase in the state's unemployment rate to 5.5 percent, she said, ''It's a time when we need to give people that additional time looking for work.''
 The National Employment Law Project estimated that 61,000 New York State residents had used up their unemployment benefits since November 2006 and remained out of work. The project, which advocates for the jobless, estimated that an additional 172,000 New Yorkers would have exhausted their benefits by March 2009 without the extension. The State Labor Department estimated that slightly more people, 259,000, would be eligible. Only California has more people potentially eligible for the extended benefits, about 645,000, according to the project's figures. 
 Some states have indexed the amount of unemployment benefits they pay to the inflation rate, but New York has not increased its maximum benefit in about a decade, Ms. Smith said.
 The top weekly benefit in New Jersey is now $560, more than one-third higher than New York's. Connecticut's top rate, $501 a week, is 24 percent higher than New York's.
 Nonetheless, unemployed city residents were happy to hear that their benefits could last more than half a year.
 ''It takes a bit of the stress off,'' said Patrick Alexander, who was laid off as a maintenance worker at Columbia University in May. 
 Mr. Alexander, 35, who lives in Harlem, said he was considering a move to Arizona, where, he has heard, the job market is stronger.
 ''Before, you could work and come home and have a position,'' Mr. Alexander said. ''Now it's like you never know. You might not have a job today or tomorrow.''

 Re ''In Act 2 of Life, Doing Work That Matters'' (Personal Health, July 8): Jane Brody reports that seniors, rather than retiring, should ''do something meaningful and make a difference for others.'' Imagine everyone did that? Imagine we had an economy committed to just that -- what some call actualization and others call well-being or just plain old happiness, rather than to endless consumption? I wager we'd have a healthier population, a healthier planet and even a healthier economy.

HEADLINE: Country, the City Version: Farms in the Sky Gain New Interest

BYLINE: By BINA VENKATARAMAN

 BODY:
What if ''eating local'' in Shanghai or New York meant getting your fresh produce from five blocks away? And what if skyscrapers grew off the grid, as verdant, self-sustaining towers where city slickers cultivated their own food?
 Dickson Despommier, a professor of public health at Columbia University, hopes to make these zucchini-in-the-sky visions a reality. Dr. Despommier's pet project is the ''vertical farm,'' a concept he created in 1999 with graduate students in his class on medical ecology, the study of how the environment and human health interact.
 The idea, which has captured the imagination of several architects in the United States and Europe in the past several years, just caught the eye of another big city dreamer: Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president. 
 When Mr. Stringer heard about the concept in June, he said he immediately pictured a ''food farm'' addition to the New York City skyline. ''Obviously we don't have vast amounts of vacant land,'' he said in a phone interview. ''But the sky is the limit in Manhattan.'' Mr. Stringer's office is ''sketching out what it would take to pilot a vertical farm,'' and plans to pitch a feasibility study to the mayor's office within the next couple of months, he said. 
 ''I think we can really do this,'' he added. ''We could get the funding.''
 Dr. Despommier estimates that it would cost $20 million to $30 million to make a prototype of a vertical farm, but hundreds of millions to build one of the 30-story towers that he suggests could feed 50,000 people. ''I'm viewed as kind of an outlier because it's kind of a crazy idea,'' Dr. Despommier, 68, said with a chuckle. ''You'd think these are mythological creatures.''
 Dr. Despommier, whose name in French means ''of the apple trees,'' has been spreading the seeds of his radical idea in lectures and through his Web site. He says his ideas are supported by hydroponic vegetable research done by NASA and are made more feasible by the potential to use sun, wind and wastewater as energy sources. Several observers have said Dr. Despommier's sky-high dreams need to be brought down to earth. 
 ''Why does it have to be 30 stories?'' said Jerry Kaufman, professor emeritus of urban and regional planning at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. ''Why can't it be six stories? There's some exciting potential in the concept, but I think he overstates what can be done.''
 Armando Carbonell, chairman of the department of planning and urban form at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy in Cambridge, Mass., called the idea ''very provocative.'' But it requires a rigorous economic analysis, he added. ''Would a tomato in lower Manhattan be able to outbid an investment banker for space in a high-rise? My bet is that the investment banker will pay more.'' 
 Mr. Carbonell questions if a vertical farm could deliver the energy savings its supporters promise. ''There's embodied energy in the concrete and steel and in construction,'' he said, adding that the price of land in the city would still outweigh any savings from not having to transport food from afar. ''I believe that this general relationship is going to hold, even as transportation costs go up and carbon costs get incorporated into the economic system.'' 
 Some criticism is quite helpful. Stephen Colbert jokingly asserted that vertical farming was elitist when Dr. Despommier appeared in June on ''The Colbert Report,'' a visit that led to a jump in hits to the project's Web site from an average of 400 daily to 400,000 the day after the show. Dr. Despommier agrees that more research is needed, and calls the energy calculations his students made for the farms, which would rely solely on alternative energy, ''a little bit too optimistic.'' He added, ''I'm a biologist swimming in very deep water right now.''
 ''If I were to set myself as a certifier of vertical farms, I would begin with security,'' he said. ''How do you keep insects and bacteria from invading your crops?'' He says growing food in climate-controlled skyscrapers would also protect against hail and other weather-related hazards, ensuring a higher quality food supply for a city, without pesticides or chemical fertilizers. 
 Architects' renderings of vertical farms -- hybrids of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and Biosphere 2 with SimCity appeal -- seem to be stirring interest. ''It also has to be stunning in terms of the architecture, because it needs to work in terms of social marketing,'' Dr. Despommier said. ''You want people to say, 'I want that in my backyard.' ''
 Augustin Rosenstiehl, a French architect who worked with Dr. Despommier to design a template ''living tower,'' said he thought that any vertical farm proposal needed to be adapted to a specific place. Mr. Rosenstiehl, principal architect for Atelier SOA in Paris, said: ''We cannot do a project without knowing where and why and what we are going to cultivate. For example, in Paris, if you grow some wheat, it's stupid because we have big fields all around the city and lots of wheat and it's good wheat. There's no reason to build towers that are very expensive.'' 
 Despite its potential problems, the idea of bringing food closer to the city is gaining traction among pragmatists and dreamers alike. A smaller-scale design of a vertical farm for downtown Seattle won a regional green building contest in 2007 and has piqued the interest of officials in Portland, Ore. The building, a Center for Urban Agriculture designed by architects at Mithun, would supply about a third of the food needed for the 400 people who would live there. 
 In June at P.S.1 Contemporary Arts Center in Queens, a husband-wife architect team built a solar-powered outdoor farm out of stacked rows of cardboard tube planters -- one that would not meet Dr. Despommier's security requirements -- with chicken coops for egg collection and an array of fruits and vegetables. 
 For Dr. Despommier, the high-rise version is on the horizon. ''It's very idealistic and ivory tower and all of that,'' he said. ''But there's a real desire to make this happen.''

HEADLINE: Taking a Cue From Ants On Evolution Of Humans

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE

 BODY:
To reach Edward O. Wilson's office on the Harvard campus, one must first push through a door with a sign warning the public not to enter. Then, enter a creaky old elevator and press two buttons simultaneously. This counterintuitive procedure transports one into a strange realm.
 It is a space that holds the world's largest collection of ants, some 14,000 species. Curators are checking the drawers, dominated by the tall figure of Dr. Wilson, who is trying to contain his excitement: the 14,001st ant species has just been discovered in the soils of a Brazilian forest. He steamrolls any incipient skepticism about the ant's uniqueness -- the new species is a living coelacanth of ants, a primitive throwback to the first ant, a wasp that shed its wings and assigned all its descendants to live in earth, not their ancestral air. The new ant is so alien, Dr. Wilson explains, so unlike any known to earthlings, that it will be named as if it came from another planet. 
 Ants are Dr. Wilson's first and enduring love. But he has become one of the world's best-known biologists through two other passions, his urge to create large syntheses of knowledge and his gift for writing. Through the power of his words, he champions the world's biodiversity and regularly campaigns for conservation measures. 
 Though he celebrated his 79th birthday last month, Dr. Wilson is generating a storm of literary output that would be impressive for someone half his age. An updated edition of ''The Superorganism,'' his encyclopedic work on ants co-written with Bert Holldobler, will be published in November. Dr. Wilson is at work on his first novel. He is preparing a treatise on the forces of social evolution, which seems likely to apply to people the lessons evident in ant colonies. And he is engaged in another fight.
 Beneath his gentle manner and Southern charm, Dr. Wilson is a scrapper. He grew up in Alabama and Florida, where the local custom with respect to fistfights was that one could prevail or get knocked out, with no third option. ''I never picked a fight,'' he wrote in ''Naturalist,'' his autobiography. ''But once started I never quit, even when losing, until the other boy gave up or an adult mercifully pulled us apart.''
 Dr. Wilson was not picking a fight when he published ''Sociobiology'' in 1975, a synthesis of ideas about the evolution of social behavior. He asserted that many human behaviors had a genetic basis, an idea then disputed by many social scientists and by Marxists intent on remaking humanity. Dr. Wilson was amazed at what ensued, which he describes as a long campaign of verbal assault and harassment with a distinctly Marxist flavor led by two Harvard colleagues, Richard C. Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould. 
 The new fight is one Dr. Wilson has picked. It concerns a central feature of evolution, one with considerable bearing on human social behaviors. The issue is the level at which evolution operates. Many evolutionary biologists have been persuaded, by works like ''The Selfish Gene'' by Richard Dawkins, that the gene is the only level at which natural selection acts. Dr. Wilson, changing his mind because of new data about the genetics of ant colonies, now believes that natural selection operates at many levels, including at the level of a social group. 
 It is through multilevel or group-level selection -- favoring the survival of one group of organisms over another -- that evolution has in Dr. Wilson's view brought into being the many essential genes that benefit the group at the individual's expense. In humans, these may include genes that underlie generosity, moral constraints, even religious behavior. Such traits are difficult to account for, though not impossible, on the view that natural selection favors only behaviors that help the individual to survive and leave more children. 
 ''I believe that deep in their heart everyone working on social insects is aware that the selection that created them is multilevel selection,'' Dr. Wilson said.
 Last year he and David Sloan Wilson, a longtime advocate of group-level selection, laid out a theoretical basis for this view in an article in the Quarterly Review of Biology. Their statement evoked a heated response from Dr. Dawkins in New Scientist; he accused them of lying on a minor point and demanded an apology.
 Proposing an idea heretical to many evolutionary biologists is one of the smaller skirmishes Dr. Wilson has set off. In his 1998 book ''Consilience,'' he proposed that many human activities, from economics to morality, needed to be temporarily removed from the hands of the reigning specialists and given to biologists to work out a proper evolutionary foundation. 
 ''It is an astonishing circumstance that the study of ethics has advanced so little since the 19th century,'' he wrote, dismissing a century of work by moral philosophers. His insight has been supported by the recent emergence of a new school of psychologists who are constructing an evolutionary explanation of morality.
 Dr. Wilson's treatise, on the shaping of social behavior, seems likely to tread firmly into this vexed arena. Morality and religion, he suspects, are traits based on group selection. ''Groups with men of quality -- brave, strong, innovative, smart and altruistic -- would tend to prevail, as Darwin said, over those groups that do not have those qualities so well developed,'' Dr. Wilson said. 
 ''Now that, obviously, is a rather unpopular idea, very politically incorrect if pushed, but nevertheless Darwin may have been right about that. Undoubtedly that will be another big controversy,'' he said without evident regret, ''and that will be my next book, when I get through my novel.''
 It is time for lunch, and he walks a visitor over to the Harvard Faculty Club. He calls attention to the ''glass palaces'' of the molecular biologists that tower over the humble old buildings inhabited by whole-animal biologists like himself. He is pleased that the cause of biological diversity is at least getting high-level attention: a day earlier, he testified on the subject before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He talks about the Encyclopedia of Life, a project he started with the help of the MacArthur Foundation. 
 Over lunch he describes his novel in progress, currently titled ''Anthill.'' Its contents have occasioned certain differences of emphasis between himself and his publisher, even though it was his editor at Norton, Robert Weil, who suggested he write it. Dr. Wilson would like ants to play a large role in the novel, given all the useful lessons that can be drawn from their behavior. The publisher sees a larger role for people and a smaller, at most ant-sized, role for ants. The novel is rotating through draft after draft as this tension is worked out. 
 Dr. Wilson has won two Pulitzer Prizes for literature, but that is no shield against a publisher's quest for perfection. ''They said, 'You can do better than that, Ed,' '' he recalled. ''I wrote another draft. They said, 'This is great, Ed, but we need more emotion, ambivalence.' '' In the next draft, he plans to have the human characters stand alone, without the ants if necessary. 
 Looking back at the ''heavy mortar fire'' that rained down on him over ''Sociobiology,'' he said he had risked his academic career and feared for a time that he had made a fatal error. His admiration for the political courage of the Harvard faculty is not without limits; many colleagues told him they supported him, but all did so privately. Academic biologists are still so afraid of inciting similar attacks that they practice sociobiology under other names, like evolutionary psychology.
 Though Dr. Wilson is a fighter when necessary, he is also a conciliator. In his most recent book, ''The Creation,'' he calls for scientists and religious leaders to make common cause in saving the natural life of the planet. He has addressed major meetings of Mormons and Southern Baptists to ask for their help in protecting biodiversity. Of the differences between science and religion, he says: ''Stop quibbling -- I'm willing to say 'Under God' and to hold my hand to my heart. That's recognition of how this country evolved, and that we are using strong language to strong purpose, even if we may not agree on how the Earth was created.''
 Lunch is over. He banters with the waitress, who has neglected the order for coffee. Then it is back to the ants and the writing and the endless quest to understand how the hand of evolution has shaped every aspect of life.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall Back After Early Gains on Rescue Plan

BYLINE: By ABHA BHATTARAI and DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
Shares ended lower Monday afternoon as investors remained unconvinced that Washington's plan to shore up the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would help the broader economy.
 Market indexes in New York initially moved higher as a wave of excitement about the rescue package swept Wall Street. In the first hour, the Dow Jones industrial average was up about 0.49 percent, or more than 100 points.
 By mid-afternoon, however, the excitement had subsided and the Dow closed down 45.35 points, or 0.41 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 11.19 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,228.30, while the Nasdaq was down 1.17 percent or 26.21 points, to 2,212.87. 
 Although the announcement may have been enough to spur a short-lived rally in the stock market, analysts say the plan was not much of a surprise. 
 ''The market opened with a sigh of relief,'' Arthur Hogan, an analyst at Jefferies & Company, said. ''But upon reflection, we realized that the government's plan doesn't quell our concerns about the economy.''
 Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae ''own or guarantee half the mortgages in the country -- but the half that they own aren't the scary ones,'' Mr. Hogan said. ''They're the most conservative: they can't lend for second homes, they can't lend for multiple properties. They're the good guys and we've always known the government would rescue them.''
 Shares in Freddie Mac closed down 8.2 percent to $7.11, recovering somewhat from an 18 percent decline. Fannie shares were down 5 percent to $9.73, after being up more than 6 percent.
 ''A rally based on nationalizing mortgage risk isn't one that can really be sustained,'' said Sean Ryan, an analyst at Sterne, Agee in New York.
 Bruce Bittles, an investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Company, said that the government's plan was ''not good news.''
 ''It was just an indication that these companies are in desperate need,'' he said.
 The rescue plan, which was announced Sunday, would give federal officials the power to inject billions of dollars into the beleaguered companies through investments and loans, easing concerns of failure at the two companies which together underwrite nearly half of all mortgage lending in the United States.
 At first, the plan seemed to calm jittery markets. Stocks increased in Europe and futures in New York rose after modest declines in Asia. The DJ Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, rose 0.58 percent in afternoon trading. The FTSE 100 index in London rose more than 0.74 percent, and the Dax in Frankfurt rose 0.76 percent. In Paris, where markets were open in spite of the Bastille Day holiday, the CAC 40 was up 1.02 percent. 
 But Wall Street was wary as it braced for its most influential banks to report quarterly earnings over the next two weeks.
 Shares of M&T Bank, which kicked off the string of earnings releases, were down 12 percent on Monday after it reported second quarter earnings of $1.44 a share, several cents lower than analyst estimates. Shares in the National City Corporation, which is based in Cleveland, were halted after they fell 29 percent, to $3.15. In a statement, the bank reported no unusual customer activity and said that it had more than $12 billion in excess short-term liquidity.
 Other bank stocks, including Zions Bancorporation and First Horizon National, tumbled after Goldman Sachs said regional banks may cut their dividends to restore capital. 
 ''The problems in the financial sector have been a huge albatross in taking everything else down,'' said Chris Lafakis, an economist for Moody'seconomy.com. ''It's a market with no hope right now.''
 The United States treasury secretary, Henry Paulson Jr., and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, acted after the shares of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae came under enormous selling pressure last week. Officials announced an emergency plan late Sunday in Washington that calls for the Treasury to greatly increase its line of credit to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and gives temporary authority for the Treasury to purchase equity in the institutions. 
 The plan also opens the Fed's discount window to the two institutions , which American officials and lawmakers have repeatedly said are too important to the financial system to be allowed to fail.
 ''Paulson's speech has restored some confidence,'' Yves Marcais, a sales trader at Global Equities in Paris, said. ''Last week there was real fear of a failure at Freddie and Fannie.'' 
 Now, he said, ''the sentiment in the market is that the U.S. authorities are prepared to do the maximum to rescue the companies.''
 Even so, some warn that investors may be taking the government's announcement too seriously.
 ''We're looking into an abyss, but we should not confuse contingency plans with reality,'' said Marc Chandler, the top currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman. ''What the treasury and Federal Reserve announced is not a bail out, it's only a plan.''
 European shares got a lift from weekend news reports suggesting the private engineering company Schaeffler Gruppe of Germany might bid for the German tire maker Continental. Continental's shares rose more than 20 percent in Frankfurt. 
 InBev, which announced a successful bid for the American brewer Anheuser-Busch, a deal that will create the world's largest beer company, rose 4 percent in Brussels. 
 Asian shares fell after an initial rally dried up. The Nikkei 225 stock average in Tokyo fell 0.2 percent, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell 1.0 percent, and the S&P/ASX 200 index in Sydney fell 1.2 percent.
 Crude futures for August delivery, which hit a record $147.27 a barrel on Friday, settled up 10 cents at $145.18 a barrel. The market was focusing on a strike among oil workers in Brazil that could cut that country's output in half helped to support prices.

HEADLINE: Judge Hints at Harsh Sentence in Adoption Fraud Case

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER

 BODY:
Judith Leekin adopted 11 children in New York City under four different names, and moved with them a decade ago to Florida. There, she is accused of abusing them -- charges she is fighting -- but she pleaded guilty in May to a fraudulent adoption scheme that netted her $1.68 million in government subsidies, money that prosecutors say she used to support a lavish lifestyle.
 On Tuesday, she will stand before a federal judge in Manhattan and learn her sentence. But what could be a cut-and-dried session promises to be something more: Ms. Leekin has drawn unusually harsh criticism from public officials and the children's lawyers, who are calling attention to the accusations of abuse in Florida, and the judge determining her fate has not only asked how the system could have prevented her fraud, but has let both sides know that he may give her a harsher sentence than prosecutors and defense lawyers have proposed.
 Rose Gill Hearn, the commissioner of the New York City Department of Investigation, wrote the judge last week to say that her office, which had interviewed some of the children, ''has never seen a case like the Leekin case.'' 
 ''To hear each describe the years of abuse and neglect that they endured was utterly heartbreaking,'' Ms. Gill Hearn wrote.
 ''Many of the children had few teeth from never having seen a dentist. Most bore physical scars from Leekin's brutality. None could read or write, their vocabulary garnered from the little television that Leekin allowed the children to watch.''
 Ms. Leekin, 63, faces 10 counts of aggravated child abuse and other charges in Florida. The authorities say the children, who were mentally or physically disabled when adopted and are now mostly young adults, were not adequately fed, were kept restrained with plastic ties, were victims of physical violence and were kept away from school. She is contesting those charges.
 When she pleaded guilty in May to the fraud scheme in New York, she admitted that she lied to child welfare officials about the number of children she actually had, and the conditions in which they were living.
 The judge who is to rule on Tuesday, Richard M. Berman of United States District Court, took the unusual step last week of announcing that he was considering imposing a longer sentence than Ms. Leekin's lawyers and prosecutors proposed when she pleaded guilty. In that deal, both sides agreed that a sentence of 6 1/2 to 8 years would be reasonable. The judge has the power to sentence her to up to 20 years for each of two counts.
 Judge Berman, who was once a family court judge in Queens, has also pointedly asked the authorities how Ms. Leekin's fraud scheme could have gone on so long without being detected, and whether fingerprinting during the adoption process or in-depth home studies could have prevented the fraud. 
 Lawyers for Ms. Leekin have asked Judge Berman not to exceed the plea bargain. They note that she has conceded guilt in the fraud case, and they say that she is remorseful. They add that she still faces the possibility of going to prison for the rest of her life if she is convicted of the separate charges in Florida. 
 ''There is a time and a place for everything in these cases, as well as in life,'' wrote one defense lawyer, Diamond R. Litty. ''Ms. Leekin's day of reckoning for the abuse charges is properly in Florida.''
 But lawyers for the children have told Judge Berman that they are concerned about the proposed sentence, given the nature of her crimes. The case is not merely one of economic fraud, they said; the children's suffering, they wrote, ''is unquestionably the direct result of the crimes for which she is charged.''
 Federal prosecutors have also asked the judge to order that she pay $1.68 million; officials say that money would go to the children, though the children's lawyers say such money ''surely will never be recovered from her.''
 In court papers, the children's lawyers provided a detailed account of the children's mistreatment. The oldest known victim, who was 5 when he was placed with Ms. Leekin, was a ''sweet autistic young man'' who spent a lifetime being hit on the head with an iron, regularly beaten for any transgression and tied up at night like a prisoner.
 A girl, who was about 7 when she was placed with Ms. Leekin, was profoundly retarded and autistic, and remains unable to describe what happened to her, the lawyers wrote. Her siblings have described ''her pulling her decaying teeth from her own mouth, the result of a childhood of no dental care.''
 Yet another child, also profoundly retarded and autistic, was placed with Ms. Leekin at age 5. His disabilities also prevent him from expressing what happened to him, the lawyers said, but his trauma is evident: He is missing teeth, and he is now blind.
 ''His siblings remember a time when he could see,'' the lawyers wrote, ''but explain that he was allowed to stare at the sun through a magnifying glass until he lost his vision.'' 
 The cases go on and on. One severely handicapped child -- he could neither speak nor walk -- disappeared from Ms. Leekin's home in 2000, the authorities say. But the office of United States Attorney Michael J. Garcia has told Judge Berman that the authorities have not been able to determine where he was taken or whether he is still alive.
 Nonetheless, Ms. Leekin continued to receive adoption subsidies for his care until last year, when her scheme was discovered, prosecutors said. 
 The government has charged that Ms. Leekin began her fraud scheme in 1988 and that it ended when it was discovered last year.
 City and state child welfare officials wrote to the judge in response to his questions about how such a fraud could have been detected earlier. State officials noted, for example, that fingerprinting was not authorized under the law when Ms. Leekin adopted the children.
 But the children's lawyers told the judge that such authorization was not needed to do fingerprinting, which could have revealed that Ms. Leekin's different aliases belonged to one person. Documents show that she collected subsidies under aliases including ''Michelle Wells,'' ''Cheryl Graham,'' ''Eastlyn J. Giraud'' and ''Anne Marie Williams.''
 The children's lawyers also cited other missed opportunities, like failures to follow up on her claims of employment, or to make unannounced home visits.
 ''While nothing can detract from the severity of defendant's criminal acts,'' the lawyers wrote, ''these children are also victims of a system that repeatedly failed at every turn to uncover the most basic and fundamental factual truths.''
 The government subsidies, like those paid to Ms. Leekin, are intended to support the adoption of children whose age, background, or physical or mental disability makes it difficult to find them adoptive homes, officials have said.
 Ms. Leekin, the prosecutors wrote, ''corrupted this system by turning it from a support network for adoptive parents and their children into a crude money-making venture.''
 In her dealings with child welfare officials, they said, Ms. Leekin used various deceptions to conceal her scheme.
 In 2002, they said, she submitted school report cards for seven of the adopted children to city officials; in fact, they say, the report cards were fraudulent, and the children had never attended the schools on the cards. 
 In pleading guilty in May, Ms. Leekin admitted that she had provided falsified reports. ''The children did not go to school,'' she said, adding, ''but I home-schooled them.''

HEADLINE: New Chief for Conservative Policy Group

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
The American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization that has funneled people and ideas into the Republican administration in Washington, on Monday named its first new president in 22 years: a business and government professor at Syracuse University, Arthur C. Brooks. 
 Mr. Brooks, 44, a visiting scholar at the institute since last year, has written seven books with an eighth on the way, ''The Virtue of Vice: Why Bad Things Are Good for Us'' (Basic Books).
 Christopher DeMuth, the institute's current president, oversaw its remarkable growth into an influential policy group over the past two decades, now with an annual budget of $30 million. He said he invited Mr. Brooks to apply for the job in March. The board unanimously chose him from a short list of 12 people, Mr. DeMuth said, adding, ''Frankly, I'm elated.''
 Mr. Brooks, who will teach two courses in the fall at Syracuse before leaving to take over at the institute's Washington headquarters on Jan. 1, said: ''The big challenge for the new person coming in is figuring out why A.E.I. is so successful. It's a great brand.''
 There is perhaps no other research group that has had more influence within the Bush White House. Dick Cheney was a fellow there before becoming vice president. His wife, Lynne V. Cheney, is now there, as is John R. Bolton, the former United Nations representative. 
 John Yoo, the Justice Department official who wrote legal opinions asserting expanded presidential powers and the right to use coercive interrogation tactics, is a visiting scholar, as is Paul D. Wolfowitz, the former deputy secretary of defense and ex-president of the World Bank. Richard Perle, a Pentagon adviser from 2001 to 2003, is a resident fellow. 
 Frederick W. Kagan, also at the institute, helped to develop the military surge strategy in Iraq and briefed President Bush and Vice President Cheney on the plan before the policy was enacted in early 2007. 
 Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, has also met with institute analysts during his presidential campaign. 
 Mr. Brooks writes about the links among culture, politics and economics. In an article in The Christian Science Monitor last month he wrote, ''Although consumerism does not buy happiness, government spending does not, either. On the contrary, it makes us less happy in general.'' Despite the rise in government spending between 1972 and 2002, he said, the percentage of Americans who said they were happy -- 30.3 percent -- did not change. Government, he concluded, ''would only make things worse for us if it tried to adjust our values through taxation and public spending.'' 
 Mr. Brooks spent 12 years playing the French horn professionally, before becoming an economist. He left music, he said, because he got bored. Public policy captured his interest entirely when he returned to college and graduate school: ''This is what I was made for.''

HEADLINE: To Set Tone, Exelon Plans Huge Cut In Emissions

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Exelon, the electric company based in Chicago, will promise on Tuesday to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by an amount larger than its total emissions in 2008, in a bid to shape the debate on carbon dioxide rules and to get a jump on compliance. 
 Many academic researchers and nonprofit groups have made proposals for cutting emissions, but Exelon's will be an unusual public presentation devised by a company that hopes to make money in the process. The plan relies heavily on conservation and having existing nuclear plants produce more power, but it includes smaller contributions from wind and sun energy. 
 The reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will come by making Exelon's operations more efficient, cutting the energy use of its electricity customers and building low-carbon generators that would displace older, less-efficient plants, many operated by rivals, the company said. 
 One reason for the pledge is to seek credit for actions that cut emissions of other companies, said Exelon's chairman and chief executive, John W. Rowe. 
 For example, Exelon plans to help the factories that it serves do the same work with less electricity so that some generating stations, owned by Exelon or others, will burn less fuel. Exelon also wants to build generating stations that use natural gas more efficiently to replace coal plants in the Midwest and East -- probably owned by other companies -- that emit far more carbon dioxide. 
 ''Dealing with greenhouse gases, while essential, is very costly,'' Mr. Rowe said. ''If you have an adequate way of accounting for offsets and displacements, we think we can offset our carbon footprint at a reasonable price.'' 
 Some components of the plan, like trying to bolster the output of its nuclear plants, are moves that Exelon would have taken anyway, Mr. Rowe acknowledged. One major step is made financially feasible by changes in the fuel markets: the price of natural gas is now so high that efficient generating stations can be built profitably to replace older plants.
 The plan's biggest components are cutting customers' use of energy by improving efficiency and increasing the output of existing reactors. Each of those moves would contribute 23 percent to the carbon reductions.
 By the company's calculation, some of those steps save money on a net basis. Some of the improvements would cut costs up to $70 a ton of carbon dioxide saved after expenses. Some of the nuclear changes would earn $60 a ton net of expenses. 
 Operators of most of the nation's 103 commercial nuclear reactors have raised output, usually by making small changes to pumps and valves and performing engineering analyses to show that they can safely produce more heat -- akin to raising a highway speed limit. 
 Exelon is counting on this source for about 16 percent of the savings. But it holds open the possibility that it could exceed its goal, and more than half the planned greenhouse gas reductions use this method.
 But the plan is remarkable for what it does not emphasize. Despite a national focus on solar and wind power, discussions in Congress about renewed tax credits for investments in windmills and solar systems and debate over a federal requirement for a minimum level of ''renewable'' energy, Exelon calls for relatively little.
 New ''renewable'' energy, including plants that run on landfill gas or wood or crop waste that can be burned, makes up just 7 percent of the carbon savings. In the region that the company serves in Pennsylvania, where state law requires electricity distributors to buy ''renewable energy credits,'' it will buy the equivalent of another 6.5 percent. 
 Sequestering the carbon dioxide from coal-burning power plants is not a technology that Exelon thinks will be available by 2020. 
 In contrast, the plan calls for improving the efficiency of its fossil-powered plants. It also calls for cutting the release of sulfur hexafluoride, a gas that is used to insulate circuit breakers but which is 24,000 times more potent for global warming than carbon dioxide, molecule for molecule. 
 ''This is a mix of things that any sensible person would do, and of things that you only can economically do if the cost of climate are incorporated into the marketplace,'' said Mr. Rowe, referring to carbon taxes or limits that require emissions trading. 
 Exelon's carbon footprint is relatively small, because it has many nuclear reactors, he said.

HEADLINE: Fed Sets Rules Meant to Stop Deceptive Lending Practices

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve adopted sweeping rules on Monday aimed at barring abusive or deceptive mortgage lending practices of the kind that analysts say have led to widespread delinquencies and foreclosures, a collapse of the housing market and an economic downturn.
 The rules, which are modifications of draft proposals issued in December, do not take effect until Oct. 1, 2009, in order to give lending institutions time to adjust. The rules will apply only to high-cost loans for people with weak credit. 
 The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the agency adjusted the original draft in December, making it tougher on lenders in some cases but also incorporating changes that lenders had lobbied for as they warned that too many restrictions would dry up the mortgage market.
 The goal, he said, was to end abuses while not aborting a recovery in the housing sector. 
 ''Although the high rate of delinquency has a number of causes,'' Mr. Bernanke said, ''it seems clear that unfair or deceptive acts and practices by lenders resulted in the extension of many loans, particularly high-cost loans, that were inappropriate for or misled the borrower.''
 He added that because the new rules apply to all mortgage lenders, not just those banks supervised by the Fed, they would ''level the playing field for lenders and increase competition in the mortgage market, to the ultimate benefit of borrowers.'' 
 The rule change had been set in motion well before the Fed's interventions to stabilize financial markets. These included its work to facilitate the sale of the investment bank Bear Stearns in March and the more recent opening of its lending window for the troubled mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 In December, the Fed acknowledged for the first time that lenders had aggressively sold deceptive loans, and it proposed that in the future, mortgage companies demonstrate that their customers could realistically afford to borrow. 
 Some critics said at the time that the Fed was doing too little, too late. But many others praised the Fed for reversing course after a long period of laissez-faire toward the lending industry that had contributed to the housing bubble.
 The new rules would bar lenders of ''higher-priced mortgage loans'' from ignoring a borrower's ability to repay from income and assets other than the home itself. 
 In a concession to consumer groups and other advocates for borrowers, the Fed dropped a provision that would have required a borrower seeking to sue a lender to demonstrate that the lender had engaged in a ''pattern or practice'' of deceptive activities.
 ''It's a major step that the Fed got rid of the 'pattern or practice' requirement,'' said Deborah Goldstein, executive vice president of the Center for Responsible Lending. ''It would have been difficult otherwise for borrowers to make the case for deceptive practices.''
 In another adjustment since December, the Fed shifted the burden somewhat to the borrower to prove a deceptive practice.
 In its original form, the Fed proposed that if a lender does not adhere to certain precautions -- like verifying the borrower's income and ability to pay -- the borrower can sue. The new rule says that a lender is presumed to have complied with the law if it verifies the consumer's income and takes other precautions. 
 The change in the way the rule defines the presumptions was welcomed by the lending industry as lessening the chances of consumer lawsuits.
 The Fed tightened one restriction on lenders, banning them from penalizing homeowners for paying off their loans ahead of schedule. The new rule applies if the payment itself can adjust during the initial four years of the mortgage.
 An official at the Independent Community Bankers of America said that the change was helpful because it clarified the circumstances under which prepayments can be barred.
 ''We are comfortable with some control on prepayment penalties in order to protect consumers,'' said Karen M. Thomas, executive vice president of the community bankers group.
 The Fed also modified how it will define high-cost mortgages by saying the determining factor is a survey of mortgage rates, rather than an index of rates for Treasury bills. This change was welcomed by both consumer and banking groups as more precise and likely to capture about the same number of mortgages.
 The Fed says that with the new rules, the overwhelming majority of subprime loans would be covered. The so-called subprime category, loans that have higher interest rates because of weaker credit histories by borrowers, increased substantially in the last years as housing values soared.
 Several other practices were outlawed for subprime mortgages, including a ban on coercing or encouraging an appraiser to misrepresent a home's value.
 The new rule would require advertising to contain additional information about interest rates, monthly payments and other features for all mortgages, not just subprime mortgages. 
 The rule would also ban ''deceptive or misleading'' advertising practices for all mortgages, particularly in the representation of when a rate or payment is fixed and when it can change.
 The Fed's actions brought guarded praise from Democrats in Congress. Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said that the rule was ''a positive first step,'' but that it should have applied to a broader array of mortgages. 
 The changes in the rule from December were overseen by Randall S. Kroszner, a Fed governor, who said more than 4,500 comments came from community groups, industry representatives and consumer advocates.
 ''Abusive loans that strip borrowers' equity or cause them to lose their homes should not be tolerated,'' Mr. Kroszner said. ''Listening carefully to the commenters, collecting and analyzing data, and undertaking consumer testing, I believe, has led to more effective and improved final rules.''

HEADLINE: Places Captured in Time, but Not Frozen There

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
WINTHROP, Wash. -- They were still wearing Stetsons and spurs, not the tight cycling shorts you see these days, when a writer dispatched by the federal government during the Great Depression reached the end of the road here in the North Cascades.
Winthrop -- population 365, altitude 1,765 feet, the town at the ''end of hard surfacing'' -- was soon committed to paper, as were thousands of other rural outposts and urban areas across the country in the 1930s and '40s.
Writers, photographers and editors, some as famous as Saul Bellow, Zora Neale Hurston and Eudora Welty and others long forgotten, earned as little as $20 a week to produce a series of travel guides about America.
''On weekdays and special occasions, these trading centers take on the appearance of pioneer towns, with hitching rails, haphazard sidewalks and crude plumbing,'' the Washington State guide said of Winthrop and other towns in the Methow Valley. It went on to describe ''riders on horseback, buckboards and buggies, and men with tanned faces and alert eyes in chaps and spurs, or blue jeans and Stetsons.'' 
Seven decades later, Winthrop is just a quick trip across the North Cascades Highway -- an escape for Seattleites seeking the dry light, a reprieve from the gray and wet they know best. Car-roof racks carry mountain bikes, kayaks or cross-country skis, depending on the time of year. Twenty-somethings slouch in for espresso. Middle-aged couples browse bookstores.
''The sun shines over here,'' said Dave Sandoz, the building official for Winthrop and its neighbor Twisp. ''That's the big thing. That makes people happy.''
Retracing some of the routes of the American Guide Series, with the old books as companions, reveals how much the nation has been reshaped, from the decline of bustling manufacturing towns in New England to the rise of California into a global center. The guides were conceived as part of a jobs program, born of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration. But they became something more: literary windows into an era and its aspirations.
The push here, for example, was for more commerce, more logging, more farming -- progress as many saw it then. Now, it's all about enjoying the scenery.
These days the Depression-era guides are experiencing a resurgence of interest. At the Library of Congress, thousands of photos, manuscripts and audio recordings dealing with the Federal Writers' Project and the New Deal have just come online. Here preservationists have revisited many of the places in the Washington State guide -- a 687-page volume, first published in 1941 -- and created an interactive modern-day travel companion.
''I don't know if Kerouac was reading these things before he got started,'' said Chris Moore, field director of the Washington Trust for Historic Preservation, which produced revisitingwashington. org. ''But that's the equivalent.''
Ask residents today what has most transformed the Methow Valley and the answer comes quickly: ''the road.'' The North Cascades Highway, also known as State Road 20, opens when the snow melts each spring, instantly connecting what the mountains divide: ancient forest and high desert, big city and small town, legacies of logging and ranching, a route for tourists and the untoured.
''It's the organic, hipper valley now, granola dispensers here and there,'' said Ryan Peppler, 28, who sells and repairs dirt bikes and all-terrain vehicles at Methow Power Sports in Twisp, just south of Winthrop. ''They should have a Subaru dealership over here.''
The highway that leads to Winthrop was completed in 1972. The road was debated for nearly a century before it was finally built. Get the cows to market more quickly, mine deeper into the rock: those were the goals for folks in the Methow Valley in the 1890s. Later, the construction of dams on the Skagit River, the primary source of power for the city of Seattle, led to improvements in the road on the west side of the mountains, too.
Back when the guides were being written, touring the engineering marvel of the dams on the other side of the mountains and the rugged beauty of the Cascades was one of Seattle's great escapes, especially the quarter-mile drive over the 389-foot Diablo Dam, where ''plans are in progress to add Japanese flowering cherries, pink dogwood, lilacs, clematis, wisteria, rhododendrons and azaleas to the landscaping on the cliffs,'' the guide says.
Tours are still offered, though the message now is to preserve wilderness, not decorate it. To get to the dams back in 1941, you would have gone through the town of Concrete, one of the last major stops before the pavement ended. A cloudy counterpoint to Winthrop on the east side, Concrete earned its name.
''The three stacks of the plant rise against billowing clouds of cement dust and smoke,'' the old guidebook says, ''and in the dry season the powder-gray dust covers houses, trees and shrubbery for miles around.''
In the 1960s, before the highway was completed, the concrete plants shut down, but the giant silos still dominate the landscape. Concrete had a bit more than 800 people when the guidebook was published. The number has declined slightly, with no new industry to help it grow. Clear days, when Sauk Mountain reveals its snowy summit, are few. The steady gray, including about 70 inches of annual precipitation, has not made it a second-home hot spot.
While Winthrop apes Western roughness, Concrete cannot escape it. Some of the old silos now stand at the center of Silo Park, where kids skateboard amid the ruins.
''I hate that thing -- it's so ugly,'' said Scott Forrester, 17, taking flight from a ramp after classes on the last day of school.
Scott, who works at a Jiffy Lube in a distant suburb of Seattle, was among many people who talked about the challenges of living in a town still trying to find its way in a new economy, a place where methamphetamines are a scourge, where the school population is shrinking.
Still, Concrete had its Hollywood moment. The words ''Welcome to Concrete'' were painted on the most prominent silos in town as a backdrop for the movie ''This Boy's Life,'' based on a memoir by the writer Tobias Wolff, who spent part of his youth here.
Winthrop, too, once a mining hub, is something of a stage set. Its declining main street was re-themed with Old West storefronts and wooden sidewalks in hopes of a boom after the highway's completion. Locals suggest the change was more of a restoration.
Fewer than 400 people live in the city limits, but faux ranches are rising quickly on the scrubby slopes and in narrow valleys. Town officials say the only thing slowing growth this year is not the weak national real estate market but the limited amount of land for new development.
The main barrier to the new Winthrop is still a natural one, winter. Snow closes the highway's mountainous midsection from November to May. And although other roads lead here, their routes are longer. That means the transformation of the Methow Valley from Old West to New West slows during the cold months, then sprints ahead each spring.
Back across the North Cascades, Concrete watches the cars go by.
''A lot of people just drive on through,'' said Jamie Turner, 40, talking with friends outside Hub, a bar on Main Street. ''And they don't bat an eye.''
This is the first in a series of articles that revisit states and landmarks in the American Guide Series of books, which was produced during the Depression by the Federal Writers' Project and has become part of the canon of American travel writing. ''Revisiting Washington,'' a digital update of ''Washington: The Evergreen State,'' is at revisitingwashington.org. ''New Deal Programs'' is a new Web guide to Library of Congress resources that writers drew on for their guides, at loc.gov/rr/program/bib/newdeal.

An old federal guide once described Winthrop, Wash., as the town at the ''end of hard surfacing.'' Much has changed since the completion of Route 20.
The Methow Valley was described extensively in a Washington State guide produced during the Great Depression by the government.

HEADLINE: CONFIDENCE EBBS FOR BANK SECTOR AND STOCKS FALL

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and ERIC DASH; Christopher Maag contributed reporting from Ohio.

 BODY:
Even as the Bush administration moved to rescue the nation's two largest mortgage finance companies, confidence in the banking sector spiraled downward Monday.
In Southern California, lines snaked around branches of IndyMac Bancorp, the large lender that was seized by federal regulators on Friday, as customers hurried to withdraw their money. As the anxiety spread through the financial markets, two other big banks, one in Ohio and another in Washington State, were compelled to assert that they were sound.
Even as federal regulators issued assurances that depositors' savings were safe, Wall Street analysts circulated lists of lenders that might be vulnerable. Shares of regional banks plunged in one of the sharpest declines since the 1980s.
Many investors fear that the government's resolve to help Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant companies at the center of the nation's mortgage market, will not hold back the rising tide of bad loans unleashed by the weakening housing market and faltering economy. 
Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said the F.D.I.C. expected a small number of the nation's banks to run into trouble over the next year. But she asserted that the worries driving down banking shares, fed by rumors in the marketplace, did not presage widespread failures.
''People should not assume that just because the stock price has been going down, that we're going to close their bank,'' Ms. Bair said. ''In addition to our credit problems, I don't want to have to start worrying about bank runs.''
Wall Street staged its own sort of bank run. Investors fled banking stocks en masse. The Standard & Poor's 500 Bank Index fell nearly 10 percent. Washington Mutual, the nation's largest savings and loan, lost more than a third of its value, prompting the lender to issue a statement that it was ''well capitalized.'' National City Corporation of Cleveland, which is the largest bank in Ohio, fell almost 15 percent. That bank also took the unusual step of issuing a statement saying that it was sound. The stock prices of large lenders in Tennessee, Alabama and Florida also swooned.
Nervous investors sent all three major stock indexes down on Monday. The Dow Jones industrials closed down 0.41 percent, at 11,055.19. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.9 percent, to close at 1,228.30, and Nasdaq fell 1.17 percent, to 2,212.87.
The worries about the financial industry that gripped Wall Street when Bear Stearns imploded in March spilled over to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last week. They are now buffeting small and midsize banks, many of which are heavily exposed to weakening local property markets and loans to home builders. Some investors fret small institutions will not receive the kind of federal support that rescued Bear Stearns and the two mortgage giants.
''The market wonders: which institution is too small to bail out?'' said William H. Gross, the chief investment officer of Pimco, the large money management company. Traders ''seem to have picked on the regional banks as potential candidates to be the ones too small to bail out.''
Several bank analysts issued dire warnings about the banking industry, particularly smaller, regional lenders. Goldman Sachs said regional banks may be forced to cut their dividends to safeguard their finances, driving down shares of banks like Zions Bancorporation of Utah and the First Horizon National Corporation of Tennessee.
Rumors swirled that customers at National City were pulling money from the bank. There were no indications of mass withdrawals at the Ohio bank or any others aside from IndyMac, the lender based in Pasadena, Calif., which was seized by regulators last week.
''Look, we are not experiencing any unusual depositor or creditor activity today,'' said Kristen Baird Adams, a spokeswoman for National City. ''There is widespread speculation and rumors in the markets today.''
The rumors continued to rip through the markets despite a warning from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Sunday that it would crack down on traders who spread false rumors. More bad news is likely this week from large banks like Citigroup, which are expected to report bleak quarterly earnings. On Monday, M&T Bank kicked off the string of earnings releases, saying its profits dropped 25 percent from a year ago. The bank's stock price fell 15.6 percent on Monday.
Regulators and investors are bracing for a small number of banks to fail over the next 12 to 18 months. Analysts predict that 50 to 150 banks might stumble. In the first quarter this year, the F.D.I.C. listed 90 banks as troubled, which is far lower than the levels during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. Still, Ms. Bair said that number would increase. IndyMac, for example, was not on that first quarter list at the F.D.I.C. but was still seized by regulators.
''We've been saying for a long time that the number of troubled banks will go up, the number of failed banks will go up,'' Ms. Bair said. ''It's going to be well into the next year at least.''
Ms. Bair said her agency was prepared to handle the problem banks, after an extensive staffing increase. The F.D.I.C. has about $53 billion to pay back consumers for deposits that are lost at failed banks and is already working on plans to raise more money to cover the depositor balances at IndyMac. The agency will raise the money from banks, she said, with riskier banks paying more. She emphasized that the number of failed banks still appears to be significantly less than those closed in the 1980s. Some banks may avoid failing because they are purchased just in time.
Nevertheless, the financial markets are reacting to even small rumors, so every bank failure presents the potential for panic, analysts said.
''It's about to start getting real bad,'' said Richard Christopher Whalen, managing director at Institutional Risk Analytics, a research firm based in Torrance, Calif. The government, he said, should just move on with the process and ''close not just one but a half-dozen institutions at the same time.''
The government's plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac initially seemed to calm nervous markets on Monday morning. The Dow Jones industrial average opened more than 100 points higher. The announcement should help regional banks that hold Fannie or Freddie bonds as well as Wall Street firms that do a significant amount of business for the government-sponsored entities.
Some investors said the government's plan simply reaffirmed negative fears about the mortgage market.
''One could argue that government measures validated concerns about how bad things really are,'' said David Bullock, managing director of Advent Capital Management, an investment fund in New York. ''We are closer to the Depression scenario than not.''
Customers at two National City branches in the Cleveland area did not seem worried, despite the near panic in the stock market. They said they had heard about the bank's drop in stock value from local radio and television news, but were not concerned enough to withdraw money from their accounts.
''Why, there's no run on the bank, is there?'' said Bernie Bragg, 60, who lives in Fairview Park, a Cleveland suburb. ''It's no big deal to me. The government said it's going to bail out Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. This thing with National City is small potatoes compared to that.''
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 27/32 on Monday, to 100 5/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, fell to 3.86 percent, from 3.96 percent.
Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Taking a Cue From Ants On Evolution Of Humans

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE

 BODY:
To reach Edward O. Wilson's office on the Harvard campus, one must first push through a door with a sign warning the public not to enter. Then, enter a creaky old elevator and press two buttons simultaneously. This counterintuitive procedure transports one into a strange realm.
It is a space that holds the world's largest collection of ants, some 14,000 species. Curators are checking the drawers, dominated by the tall figure of Dr. Wilson, who is trying to contain his excitement: the 14,001st ant species has just been discovered in the soils of a Brazilian forest. He steamrolls any incipient skepticism about the ant's uniqueness -- the new species is a living coelacanth of ants, a primitive throwback to the first ant, a wasp that shed its wings and assigned all its descendants to live in earth, not their ancestral air. The new ant is so alien, Dr. Wilson explains, so unlike any known to earthlings, that it will be named as if it came from another planet. 
Ants are Dr. Wilson's first and enduring love. But he has become one of the world's best-known biologists through two other passions, his urge to create large syntheses of knowledge and his gift for writing. Through the power of his words, he champions the world's biodiversity and regularly campaigns for conservation measures.
Though he celebrated his 79th birthday last month, Dr. Wilson is generating a storm of literary output that would be impressive for someone half his age. ''The Superorganism,'' with Bert Holldobler, a new book with information on termites, wasps, bees and ants, will be published in November. Dr. Wilson is at work on his first novel. He is preparing a treatise on the forces of social evolution, which seems likely to apply to people the lessons evident in ant colonies. And he is engaged in another fight.
Beneath his gentle manner and Southern charm, Dr. Wilson is a scrapper. He grew up in Alabama and Florida, where the local custom with respect to fistfights was that one could prevail or get knocked out, with no third option. ''I never picked a fight,'' he wrote in ''Naturalist,'' his autobiography. ''But once started I never quit, even when losing, until the other boy gave up or an adult mercifully pulled us apart.''
Dr. Wilson was not picking a fight when he published ''Sociobiology'' in 1975, a synthesis of ideas about the evolution of social behavior. He asserted that many human behaviors had a genetic basis, an idea then disputed by many social scientists and by Marxists intent on remaking humanity. Dr. Wilson was amazed at what ensued, which he describes as a long campaign of verbal assault and harassment with a distinctly Marxist flavor led by two Harvard colleagues, Richard C. Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould.
The new fight is one Dr. Wilson has picked. It concerns a central feature of evolution, one with considerable bearing on human social behaviors. The issue is the level at which evolution operates. Many evolutionary biologists have been persuaded, by works like ''The Selfish Gene'' by Richard Dawkins, that the gene is the only level at which natural selection acts. Dr. Wilson, changing his mind because of new data about the genetics of ant colonies, now believes that natural selection operates at many levels, including at the level of a social group.
It is through multilevel or group-level selection -- favoring the survival of one group of organisms over another -- that evolution has in Dr. Wilson's view brought into being the many essential genes that benefit the group at the individual's expense. In humans, these may include genes that underlie generosity, moral constraints, even religious behavior. Such traits are difficult to account for, though not impossible, on the view that natural selection favors only behaviors that help the individual to survive and leave more children.
''I believe that deep in their heart everyone working on social insects is aware that the selection that created them is multilevel selection,'' Dr. Wilson said.
Last year he and David Sloan Wilson, a longtime advocate of group-level selection, laid out a theoretical basis for this view in an article in the Quarterly Review of Biology. Their statement evoked a heated response from Dr. Dawkins in New Scientist; he accused them of lying on a minor point and demanded an apology.
Proposing an idea heretical to many evolutionary biologists is one of the smaller skirmishes Dr. Wilson has set off. In his 1998 book ''Consilience,'' he proposed that many human activities, from economics to morality, needed to be temporarily removed from the hands of the reigning specialists and given to biologists to work out a proper evolutionary foundation.
''It is an astonishing circumstance that the study of ethics has advanced so little since the 19th century,'' he wrote, dismissing a century of work by moral philosophers. His insight has been supported by the recent emergence of a new school of psychologists who are constructing an evolutionary explanation of morality.
Dr. Wilson's treatise, on the shaping of social behavior, seems likely to tread firmly into this vexed arena. Morality and religion, he suspects, are traits based on group selection. ''Groups with men of quality -- brave, strong, innovative, smart and altruistic -- would tend to prevail, as Darwin said, over those groups that do not have those qualities so well developed,'' Dr. Wilson said.
''Now that, obviously, is a rather unpopular idea, very politically incorrect if pushed, but nevertheless Darwin may have been right about that. Undoubtedly that will be another big controversy,'' he said without evident regret, ''and that will be my next book, when I get through my novel.''
It is time for lunch, and he walks a visitor over to the Harvard Faculty Club. He calls attention to the ''glass palaces'' of the molecular biologists that tower over the humble old buildings inhabited by whole-animal biologists like himself. He is pleased that the cause of biological diversity is at least getting high-level attention: a day earlier, he testified on the subject before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He talks about the Encyclopedia of Life, a project he started with the help of the MacArthur Foundation.
Over lunch he describes his novel in progress, currently titled ''Anthill.'' Its contents have occasioned certain differences of emphasis between himself and his publisher, even though it was his editor at Norton, Robert Weil, who suggested he write it. Dr. Wilson would like ants to play a large role in the novel, given all the useful lessons that can be drawn from their behavior. The publisher sees a larger role for people and a smaller, at most ant-sized, role for ants. The novel is rotating through draft after draft as this tension is worked out.
Dr. Wilson has won two Pulitzer Prizes for literature, but that is no shield against a publisher's quest for perfection. ''They said, 'You can do better than that, Ed,' '' he recalled. ''I wrote another draft. They said, 'This is great, Ed, but we need more emotion, ambivalence.' '' In the next draft, he plans to have the human characters stand alone, without the ants if necessary.
Looking back at the ''heavy mortar fire'' that rained down on him over ''Sociobiology,'' he said he had risked his academic career and feared for a time that he had made a fatal error. His admiration for the political courage of the Harvard faculty is not without limits; many colleagues told him they supported him, but all did so privately. Academic biologists are still so afraid of inciting similar attacks that they practice sociobiology under other names, like evolutionary psychology.
Though Dr. Wilson is a fighter when necessary, he is also a conciliator. In his most recent book, ''The Creation,'' he calls for scientists and religious leaders to make common cause in saving the natural life of the planet. He has addressed major meetings of Mormons and Southern Baptists to ask for their help in protecting biodiversity. Of the differences between science and religion, he says: ''Stop quibbling -- I'm willing to say 'Under God' and to hold my hand to my heart. That's recognition of how this country evolved, and that we are using strong language to strong purpose, even if we may not agree on how the Earth was created.''
Lunch is over. He banters with the waitress, who has neglected the order for coffee. Then it is back to the ants and the writing and the endless quest to understand how the hand of evolution has shaped every aspect of life.
Correction: July 19, 2008, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about the biologist Edward O. Wilson described incorrectly his forthcoming book, ''The Superorganism.'' It is a new book -- not an ''updated edition'' -- that contains new information on termites, wasps, bees and ants, as well as information updated from an earlier book, ''The Ants.'' And a correction in this space on Friday misspelled the given name of Dr. Wilson's co-author on both books. As the article correctly noted, he is Bert Holldobler, not Burt.

HEADLINE: Scramble Led To Rescue Plan On Mortgages

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; Reporting was contributed by Gretchen Morgenson and Jenny Anderson from New York, Sheryl Gay Stolberg and David M. Herszenhorn from Washington and Eric Dash from London.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration hastily arranged the dramatic Sunday evening rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after Wall Street executives and foreign central bankers told Washington that any further erosion of confidence could have a cascading effect around the world, officials said on Monday.
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and other top officials were warned, after Fannie and Freddie lost nearly half their stock market value on Friday morning, that any more turmoil threatened to reduce the value of trillions of dollars of the companies' debt and other obligations, which are held by thousands of domestic and foreign banks, pension funds, mutual funds and other investors, government officials said.
The warnings of a potential systemic failure led to the resulting rescue package, and one of the most striking -- though unspoken -- regulatory shifts in modern times. For decades, Treasury secretaries and Federal Reserve chairmen have insisted that the government did not stand behind the debt of Fannie and Freddie. But the safety net Mr. Paulson announced on Sunday sends the opposite message: that the government is determined not to let either one fail. 
For the second time in four months, the housing crisis prompted the government to scramble over a weekend to rescue a major financial institution. While the danger of a systemic failure arising from Fannie and Freddie's market problems was not as immediate as in March when Bear Stearns stumbled, the stakes were exponentially bigger.
Fannie and Freddie have combined debts of $1.5 trillion. They own or guarantee $5 trillion in mortgages. They have contracts with other institutions worth $2 trillion more to hedge the risks behind those mortgages.
The rescue package was cobbled together on Saturday and Sunday during a series of telephone calls and meetings involving senior officials at the Treasury and the Federal Reserve.
As he announced the plan, Mr. Paulson became the first Treasury secretary in more than a decade to use the steps of the imposing Treasury building as a backdrop. It seemed like a well-scripted moment aimed at calming the markets, as Robert E. Rubin, a Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, once did.
But in fact, it was happenstance. Because it was a Sunday, the Treasury Department's security measures would not allow large numbers of reporters to enter the building, forcing Mr. Paulson to make his announcement outside.
Just three days earlier, Mr. Paulson was the picture of calm when he told a Congressional committee that there was no need for any new or additional legislation beyond what he had previously sought because, he said, there ''isn't a silver bullet'' to restore the markets.
''I have grown up in a world where you don't always have all the tools you'd like to have and where I've very seldom seen a perfect hand that someone has to play,'' he told the members of the House Financial Services Committee, noting that it was better to do things right than to rush through legislation that did not correctly address bigger systemic issues.
But by Sunday afternoon, Mr. Paulson was telling lawmakers that the plan he was about to make public in a few hours would arm him, and his successors, with ''a bazooka in my pocket to pull out when we need it to shoot down'' problems that the companies might face in the financial markets, several lawmakers recalled.
The plan calls on Congress to give officials the power to inject billions of dollars into the beleaguered companies through investments and loans. Until the plan is adopted, the Federal Reserve has agreed to let the companies have access to its so-called discount lending window, a move that most regard as a symbolic gesture intended to show the markets that the government stands ready to help the companies if they need cash.
Officials said the prospect of eroding confidence in the debt securities of Fannie and Freddie was far more worrisome to them than either the declining stock price of the companies or the results of a $3 billion debt auction on Monday by Freddie Mac. Those events, they said, were significant only insofar as they could more broadly threaten to undermine confidence in the companies.
The concern, they said, was that if those Fannie and Freddie debt securities began to decline in value, then thousands of institutions -- including all of the nation's major banks, and many large mutual funds, money market funds and pension funds -- might have to recognize losses on their portfolios.
That, in turn, could have lasting effects on economies here and abroad already struggling from slumping housing markets, spiking energy prices and sharp declines in consumer confidence. The debt securities of Fannie and Freddie are nearly as ubiquitous as the debt issued by the United States government. In the minds of most investors, they are also almost as safe.
By Friday morning, Mr. Paulson began a quiet retreat from his testimony of a day earlier. After a weekly breakfast with Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, at the Treasury, the two men separately began to call lawmakers and tell them they were considering a range of options to stem the tide.
That morning, the markets were signaling another brutal day, as the stocks in both companies precipitously declined. Hoping to buy the administration a weekend of time to consider its options, Mr. Paulson issued a statement that morning suggesting to the markets that the administration had no interest in nationalizing either company.
By the end of the day, the companies' shares had rebounded somewhat, though both had suffered significant declines for the week.
By all accounts, Mr. Paulson was the engineer of the rescue package. Only days earlier, he had lost his right-hand adviser on Wall Street issues, Robert Steel, who left as Treasury under secretary, with virtually no notice, to head Wachovia Bank. For their part, Fed officials decided that since the problems in the markets did not reflect a liquidity problem -- meaning that Fannie and Freddie had access to plenty of cash -- they would take a secondary role to the Treasury.
In a 10 a.m. Saturday telephone conference call led by Mr. Paulson, and which included Mr. Bernanke and senior officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies, Mr. Paulson suggested that a housing bill now moving through Congress could provide a legislative vehicle to get a rescue package adopted quickly, an official recalled.
During the hourlong call, Mr. Paulson discussed the idea of enlarging a credit line to the Treasury that both companies have. For nearly 40 years, each has had a $2.25 billion line of credit. While large when it was set by Congress, the amount is now considered quite small compared with the overall obligations of the two companies.
Other participants considered providing the companies access to the Fed's discount lending window, at least temporarily, as a confidence-building measure.
Mr. Paulson told the participants that he planned through the day to reach out to the leaders in the House and Senate, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. He talked about the timing of reaching out to a lawmaker who was in Europe.
The rescue package did not come together until late Saturday, officials said, after Mr. Paulson had received assurances from lawmakers that the measure would have support in Congress. At that point, Mr. Paulson made a round of late-evening phone calls to top executives at the two companies. It was after 11 p.m. when he spoke to Daniel Mudd, the chief executive of Fannie Mae and the son of the former CBS newsman Roger Mudd.
The Fannie and Freddie chief executives endorsed the plan after consulting with their directors.
After Mr. Paulson called Mr. Bernanke on Saturday evening to apprise him of the prospects for a plan, Mr. Bernanke called the governors of the Fed to alert them that there would be a meeting at 1 p.m. on Sunday to consider letting the companies have access to the discount window.
Two hours after that meeting began, Mr. Paulson convened another conference call with the same officials who had been on the Saturday call. On that call, a participant said, Mr. Paulson outlined how he expected the day's developments would unfold.
After completing the call, Mr. Paulson phoned more lawmakers from his corner office overlooking the White House, telling them more details of the plan he would make public that evening.
On Capitol Hill, House Democrats said they would move quickly to approve the Treasury Department plan as part of a major package of housing legislation, and that the bill could be returned to the Senate, adopted, and sent to the White House for President Bush's signature, perhaps by the end of this week.
Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, and a main author of the housing legislation, began working on Monday to incorporate Mr. Paulson's plan into the bill. And Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee, said he would hold a hearing on the proposal on Tuesday, with testimony expected by Mr. Paulson, Mr. Bernanke and Christopher Cox, the chairman of the S.E.C.
In an interview, Mr. Dodd said the legislation was needed ''to restore some confidence to a market that has been gripped by fear for the last couple of days.'' If the House acted quickly, Mr. Dodd said, he hoped the Senate would follow suit. ''I'd love to be able to do it by the end of the week.''
But there were also signs that the proposal could encounter resistance. Senate Republicans, including some who have been unhappy about the outsize role that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have assumed in the mortgage market, were largely silent on the proposal. An aide said that Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, was reviewing the plan. And Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, began circulating a letter among fellow conservatives urging House leaders to call committee hearings, hold a full debate and allow lawmakers to offer amendments -- a potentially lengthy process.

HEADLINE: Appointments With Red Ink

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Vikram S. Pandit summoned 60 executives to Armonk, N.Y., last Tuesday to present his plan to buck up Citigroup, the beleaguered bank he runs.
But his seven-point proposal, called ''Rules of the Road,'' will do nothing to cushion the blows that are likely to come in the days and weeks ahead, when Citigroup and other big banks are expected to report yet another round of grim quarterly results.
As fears spread about the health of the financial sector Monday, when shares of many regional banks plunged, investors were bracing for even more bad news from some of the nation's largest financial companies, among them Citigroup. 
On Thursday, Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage, is expected to disclose billions of dollars of new write-downs and a big quarterly loss. That same day, JPMorgan Chase is likely to report its profit fell by half. And on Friday, Citigroup is expected to report its third straight quarter in the red.
Citigroup, the financial conglomerate formed a decade ago, reflects many of the ills plaguing the industry.
As home prices continue to decline and the economy struggles, Americans are falling behind on their mortgages and home equity loans in growing numbers. Delinquencies on auto loans and credit cards are on the rise. Concern is growing about souring loans made to builders and commercial real estate developers.
Citigroup is exposed to all of this. It has recorded more than $45 billion in credit losses and write-downs since mid-2007 and lost nearly $15 billion in the last two quarters. Its shareholders have paid a steep price: The stock has lost nearly 70 percent of its value in the last year. On Monday, Citigroup shares fell 6 percent lower, closing at $15.22, the lowest share price since the company was formed in 1998.
''There is no place to hide for them,'' said Meredith A. Whitney, an Oppenheimer banking analyst. ''They are the biggest bank, which means they had big exposures to every asset class.''
Mr. Pandit, who has been chief executive for eight months, is trying to turn around Citigroup as the banking industry struggles through one of its most challenging periods since the Depression. His task is particularly difficult because many Citigroup bankers, paid with stock and options for years, have seen their fortunes vanish. Morale is low.
Last week, at the company's rustic meeting center in Armonk, about 30 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Pandit tried to lift spirits and brainstorm for ideas about how to reshape his company's culture. He pushed 60 top managers to build on his seven rules, which he unveiled in the last few weeks. Those rules include items like ''client connectivity,'' ''transparency'' and ''product excellence.''
But some Citigroup insiders roll their eyes at what they see as dull platitudes. Instead of embarking on a bold new course, as some investors had hoped, Mr. Pandit seems to be turning to the playbook of his predecessor, Charles O. Prince III, who was forced out last year.
Like Mr. Prince, Mr. Pandit is pursuing plans to promote international and internal growth, and to streamline the company and eliminate thousands of jobs. Mr. Pandit is also trying to reshape Citigroup's culture, just as Mr. Prince did in his first year as chief executive.
Mr. Pandit's executives say they are confident the strategy will pay off, but they have no illusions about how long it may take.
''This isn't like a sprint. This really is a marathon,'' said Gary L. Crittenden, Citigroup's finance chief. It could be two to three years before the bank's returns improve significantly, he said.
Wall Street is growing impatient. ''Some of the objectives set forth have been in motion for many years,'' said William Tanona, who follows Citigroup for Goldman Sachs. ''With each passing quarter, there will be increased urgency for people to see results.''
Since becoming chief executive, Mr. Pandit has raised about $40 billion in capital, and announced plans to eliminate more than 19,000 jobs. Amid a scathing risk management review by the Federal Reserve, Mr. Pandit installed Brian R. Leach, a trusted hand, as the bank's chief risk officer and overhauled the organizational chart.
Mr. Pandit's senior executives say he has led thoughtful, probing business reviews. revamped reporting lines so that regional executives can make decisions faster.
''If you want to be in the emerging markets and be successful, you have to be locally empowered,'' said Ajay Banga, who oversees Citigroup's operations in Asia. A bonus plan to reward managers for working together is next.
Even so, Mr. Pandit had mixed success firing up his troops. And privately, some senior Citigroup managers say they are sometimes frustrated that he does not always include them in making decisions that affect their businesses. Part of this is the need to move quickly, they say.
Mr. Pandit keeps close counsel with a handful of trusted lieutenants that many say is the real power base within Citigroup. Internally, it is known as the Gang of Five.
Citigroup board members have also warned Mr. Pandit about being more forthcoming with them. Alain J. P. Belda, Citigroup's lead director, and several other board members were upset when they learned about major moves in the press; Mr. Prince, a smoother politician, took pains to alert them to big changes.
It would not be surprising if Richard D. Parsons, Time Warner's chairman, takes over for Mr. Belda as lead director when board seats are rotated this summer, according to a person briefed on the situation. The hope is that Mr. Parsons's easy-going style might improve relations.
In a statement, Mr. Belda did not address the past but said Citigroup's board is ''well apprised of all significant changes'' and was not aware of any director, including himself, feeling out of the information loop.

HEADLINE: European Economies Sag, but Euro Remains Strong

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Europe, which held the world's economic storms at bay for the last year, has finally succumbed. 
 Spain, Ireland and Denmark are either in a recession or on the brink. Italy is stagnating. France is weakening fast. And Germany, the sturdy locomotive of European growth, is suddenly faltering -- dashing most residual hopes that Europe could escape the upheaval in the United States. 
 On Tuesday, an influential poll of German investors by the Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim found that confidence had plummeted to its lowest level since the survey was started in 1991. 
 Shares in Spain swooned after that country's housing crisis claimed its first big casualty: a property developer that filed for protection from creditors. And in Britain, the inflation rate surged -- as it has elsewhere in Europe -- to 3.8 percent because of prices for food and fuel. 
 ''We've seen a sea change in Europe,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London. ''All the bad news around the world has finally come to us.'' 
 While most economists had predicted that Europe would suffer fallout from the financial market chaos and the broader American malaise, the speed of the deterioration has been surprising. 
 As recently as June, Mr. Mayer noted, the European Central Bank was projecting only a modest dip in growth in the second quarter. Two weeks ago, it raised interest rates, citing the risk of inflation. Now the risk is that Europe, as a whole, could face a shrinking economy this summer. 
 In that sense, Europe finds itself on a precipice similar to that in the United States, which is already in or verging on a serious slump. But given the historic resilience of the American economy, some economists give the Americans slightly better odds of avoiding a recession -- as usually defined, a period in which economic growth shrinks for two quarters in a row -- than the Europeans. 
 ''It is not impossible that the euro zone will dip into recession while the U.S. manages to skirt it,'' said Holger Schmieding, the chief European economist at Bank of America in London. 
 Such a statement would have been far-fetched four months ago, when investor confidence and industrial output were rising in Germany and France, despite a buoyant currency that makes European exports more expensive in the United States and other dollar-linked markets. 
 One dynamic that has not changed since then is the euro, which hit a new high against the dollar Tuesday, rising to $1.6038, surpassing a previous record of $1.6018 set April 22. It fell back to $1.5969. 
 The tense mood in the United States is pushing investors to sell dollars and seek refuge in the euro. For all the storm clouds here, Europe still looks like a safe harbor in comparison to the United States, where fears about the solvency of the government-sponsored mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have rattled the broader market. 
 Still, the strong euro -- combined with high oil prices -- is exacting a toll on Europe's export machine. 
 German exports slumped 3.2 percent in May from the previous month, the largest monthly decline since June 2004. The country's once-robust trade surplus shrank to 14.4 billion euros, or $23 billion, from 18.8 billion euros, according to government statistics. 
 ''The Germans had full order books when this started,'' Mr. Schmieding said, ''but now they are emptying.'' 
 Germany, experts said, was the last big European country to keep its momentum because of its role as a supplier of machinery and other capital goods to China and other fast-growing economies. 
 As Americans have stopped buying television sets and other goods from China, however, the Chinese have begun to curtail their orders of machinery from Germany, economists said. 
 For Germany, the biggest threat may not be a recession but an inflationary spiral that drives up wages. The German airline Lufthansa is at odds with the union representing its cabin and ground staff over the union's demand for a 9.8 percent pay increase this year. 
 Lufthansa offered 6.7 percent, which the union, Ver.di, rejected. Now it is collecting ballots for a strike, which it says could begin at the end of August. 
 The European Central Bank, in raising rates a quarter point this month, was trying to discourage that kind of behavior. But with inflation running at 4 percent -- twice the threshold set by the bank -- economists said a one-time rate increase would have limited effect. 
 With Europe slowing so rapidly, economists believe it will be tough for the inflation fighters on the central bank's governing board to marshal the votes for any further rate increases. 
 In Britain, the worsening conditions had fanned expectations that the Bank of England would cut rates soon. Now, though, the surge in inflation has doused those hopes, even though it comes amid reports of weaker housing prices. 
 The situation in Britain is still relatively benign compared with that in Spain. With its once-frothy housing market in a free fall, economists say Spain will probably enter a recession later this year. 
 On Tuesday, a major property developer, Martinsa-Fadesa, declared insolvency after failing to refinance its debt. Average home prices fell in the second quarter, for the first time in a decade, according to the Spanish government. 
 ''The hard landing in Spain is very similar to the one in the U.S., but in Spain, it is happening much faster,'' said Jose Carlos Diez, chief economist at the brokerage firm InterMoney in Madrid.

HEADLINE: As the Economy Heads South, Office Rents Go North

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
The economy is in a downturn; job losses in Manhattan in financial services and related industries are expected to exceed 20,000; and the capital markets remain in turmoil. And yet some landlords are demanding higher rents than ever.
 The L&L Holding Company is seeking an annual rent of $85 a square foot -- more than space in that neighborhood has ever commanded, according to its broker, Howard Fiddle, a vice chairman at CB Richard Ellis -- for 400,000 square feet at the former International Toy Center, a building at 200 Fifth Avenue that is undergoing extensive renovation in the Flatiron district. Last year, the Grey Group, an advertising agency that is part of WPP Group, agreed to lease the lower half of the building. 
 David W. Levinson, the chief executive of L&L, conceded that the leasing office was not being besieged by prospective tenants for the top half. ''There is some level of interest,'' he said. ''But the rents that people are interested in are lower than what we want to take right now.''
 But Mr. Levinson saw no reason to lower his expectations for 200 Fifth. Once prospective tenants had a chance to see the results of the $100 million renovation, they would be won over, he predicted. 
 Landlords like Mr. Levinson have managed to remain calm about the current market, even while some expect some bumpy months in the near future. Though more sublet space is coming onto the market, the pace of leasing has slowed, rents have more or less flattened and the vacancy rate is rising, many real estate specialists say things could be a lot worse, especially when measured against the last downturn. 
 ''In comparison to 2001, the market is performing very well,'' said Sam Chandan, the chief economist for Reis, a New York research company. ''The market is proving to be very stable.''
 According to Reis, the average annual rent -- after concessions like free rent and help with remodeling are subtracted -- was $58.49 a square foot at the end of June, compared with $56.33 last December.
 But some tenants' brokers cite a few disquieting signs. Since August 2007, the number of blocks of space of 100,000 square feet or more on the market has increased by 68 percent and more are expected to be added, according to Studley, a brokerage firm that represents tenants.
 At the moment though, only 34 such blocks are on the market. ''If you are a tenant representative looking for blocks of over 100,000 square feet, you are really limited,'' said Lisa J. Kiell, a managing director at the brokerage firm Jones Lang LaSalle. 
 Still, in recent weeks, millions of square feet at prestigious addresses have hit the market as troubled companies like Lehman Brothers and Citigroup seek to dipose of space. An increase in sublet space is almost certain to drive down rents as tenants try to trim their real estate costs by making quick deals. But so far, the amount of sublease space remains relatively modest. In 2002, during the last downturn, sublets made up 41 percent of available space; today, they represent only 22 percent, CB Richard Ellis reported. 
 About 8.3 million square feet of sublease space is currently being offered, an increase of 32.6 percent since January, Studley analysts said. That is still a minuscule proportion of Manhattan's office market of 412 million square feet. ''But it's concentrated where you would expect it to be -- in the highest-priced markets,'' said Keith DeCoster, manager of real estate analytics for Studley.
 Some of the sublet space is already being absorbed. In one of the biggest deals so far this year, American International Group, the giant insurance company, agreed to sublease 803,000 square feet at 180 Maiden Lane -- space that Goldman Sachs is giving up because it is building a headquarters in Battery Park City. The rent was not disclosed.
 As tenants become cost-conscious, more are choosing to renew their leases rather than look for new space and spend a lot to refurbish it. Renewals constituted 44 percent of the leasing market in the first half of this year, compared with 36 percent a year earlier, according to CB Richard Ellis. 
 Still, tenants who are renewing are not only paying much more for the space because real estate values have soared in recent years, but are also being charged for more square footage even if their footprint has not expanded, said Mary Ann Tighe, the regional chief executive for CB Richard Ellis. 
 Under a longstanding New York tradition, landlords use a formula to charge tenants extra for common space in their buildings, like lobbies and stairwells, that cannot rented out; this is calculated by adding a fixed percentage to the actual measurement. 
 In 2005, that fixed percentage, known as the ''loss factor,'' increased to 27 percent, from 25 percent. As a result, a space of, say, 10,000 square feet is now considered 12,700 square feet, an increase from the previous 12,500 square feet, and tenants are charged accordingly. ''Without exception, everyone who has renewed is paying higher rent, and on more square footage,'' Ms. Tighe said.
 Landlords will be better equipped than in past downturns to weather turmoil in the financial markets because New York's economy has become more diverse, with an influx of international companies and new or growing tenants from media, advertising, technology and health care, said William C. Rudin, president of the Rudin Management Company. 
 In the first half of the year, advertising agencies signed nearly 20 percent of the office leases, while financial services tenants accounted for a mere 14.1 percent, Cushman & Wakefield reported.
 But many tenants are hesitating to make deals, said Ruth Colp-Haber, a partner at Wharton Properties Advisors, which represents small- to medium-size tenants. ''Every tenant that can is waiting,'' she said. ''Everyone has one goal in mind: to reduce costs.'' In the first half of the year, 10.5 million square feet of space was leased, reflecting the slowest pace since 2003, though it picked up slightly in the second quarter, according to CB Richard Ellis.
 Some landlords are not being realistic, Ms. Colp-Haber said. At 14 Wall Street, a century-old 37-story building in the financial district, the asking annual rent for the top floor was $62 a foot -- well above market rent, she said. The building has 42 spaces available, including six sublets, and a vacancy rate of 16.3 percent, according to CoStar Group, a research company in Bethesda, Md. 
 The landlord, Josh Zamir, the managing principal at Capstone Equities, said about 230,000 square feet has been leased at 14 Wall since his company bought the building last year. Capstone's broker, Mr. Fiddle of CB Richard Ellis, said a hedge fund was expected to take the top floor, at less than $60 a foot. 
 Marisa Manley, the president of Commercial Tenants Real Estate Representation, a brokerage firm in Manhattan, said there was a ''disparity of vision'' between landlords and tenants. ''The landlords are looking in the rearview mirror,'' she said. ''The tenants are reading the newspaper. You get a little gridlock there.''

HEADLINE: Blazing a Trail From a Reservation Into Ownership

BYLINE: By MATT HIGGINS

DATELINE: OHSWEKEN, Ontario 

 BODY:
On a sunny afternoon two weeks ago, Curt Styres sat in the grandstand here at Ohsweken Speedway talking above the roar of a tractor grooming the dirt track. He recalled a night this May when he had been driving the tractor, as he usually does before stock car races.
 And how afterward he put on a suit and boarded a flight for Chicago, where he was to be approved as the newest American Hockey League owner. At the meeting, representatives from the minor league's other 28 franchises questioned Styres, the 48-year-old prospective owner of the Rochester Americans. They wanted to know about his finances, what he did for a living and where he came from. The answers to those questions inevitably lead here to Ohsweken, a small, rural town on the 45,000-acre Six Nations of the Grand River Reserve, located about an hour southwest of Toronto.
 Styres, a Mohawk, has lived on the reserve his entire life. He built his businesses here. They include the raceway and a partnership in a tobacco company that employs 200 people at its plant in Ohsweken, and more at a second plant near Berlin. 
 In May, Styres paid $5.5 million to buy a 60 percent controlling share of the Rochester Knighthawks of the National Lacrosse League, and an undisclosed price for the Americans. He says he thinks he is the first individual American Indian -- known in Canada as First Nations people -- to own a major professional sports franchise. The Mohegan Tribe owns the Connecticut Sun of the W.N.B.A.
 ''He's one of the truly successful First Nations entrepreneurs in Canada,'' said Phil Fontaine, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, an aboriginal advocacy organization representing 630 communities. ''It's made it possible for him to give back to his community in a very significant way.''
 Even as his business empire expands to the United States and Europe, the reserve remains as central to his sense of self as his Mohawk heritage.
 ''I just look at me as a working man from the bush,'' said Styres, his gray-streaked pony tail dancing in the wind.
 Growing up, he shared a 12-foot by 20-foot former Army barracks that lacked indoor plumbing with his widowed mother and four siblings. His world was not much bigger.
 He ventured outside the reserve for youth hockey and lacrosse games, and to find work on nearby farms. He later traveled as an ironworker. What he saw shaped his desire to improve conditions on the reserve.
 In 1991, he co-founded Grand River Enterprises, a tobacco operation. Its success led to the Dreamcatcher Fund, which helps First Nations people across Canada pay for education and athletics.
 In 2002, Styres bought a stake in the Six Nations Arrows Express, a junior lacrosse team. He built the Iroquois Lacrosse Arena, a 2,600-seat facility in Ohsweken, then hired trainers, nutritionists and tutors for the teenage players.
 Two years later, four players from the team were enrolled in college. By 2008, 15 players were enrolled, including Sid Smith, a defenseman for N.C.A.A. champion Syracuse.
 ''Natives can use lacrosse as a steppingstone to better their future,'' Styres said. ''Once you get an education, you come back and show the people here you can do it.''
 Styres studied manufacturing machines at Mohawk College, a trade school in nearby Hamilton. But he learned some of his most enduring lessons in the tobacco fields in southern Ontario. Each summer as a child, he planted and harvested alongside his mother.
 ''They saw me working hard all my life,'' Vera Styres, 73, said about her five children.
 After they were grown, she earned university degrees in Native studies and social work, and became a social worker and teacher. A proud woman, she was moved to tears by memories of more difficult times.
 Last month, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper formally apologized in the House of Commons for a former residential school system that forced indigenous children from their homes and placed them in institutions where many were subjected to physical and emotional abuse. Vera Styres, who as a girl was sent to the Mohawk Institute, attributed the apology to newfound economic and political clout among American Indians.
 As Styres and her children have prospered, so has their reserve. The population has increased to 11,297 in 2005 from 4,907 in 1972, making it the largest First Nations community in Canada. Curt Styres lives in a colossal 21,000-square-foot stone house with a movie theater and a fitness center.
 Still, basic amenities like public water and sewers are not widely available. And non-native businesses have not been attracted to the area even though the reserve is thriving.
 Styres believes he is duty-bound to change these things for his people and for his nine children. ''When my grandkids grow up, they're going to say, 'Your excuse was what again?' ''
 The Knighthawks are a more immediate concern. Rochester is the smallest market in the lacrosse league. Styres acknowledged that turning a profit would be a challenge. The former controlling owner, Steve Donner, encountered financial problems and fell out of favor with Rochester city officials.
 Styres said he bought the Knighthawks and the Americans, the top farm team for the N.H.L.'s Florida Panthers, because of his love of sport. Photographs of him playing hockey and lacrosse on local teams hang in his office and at the arena.
 Fans in Rochester feared the teams would be relocated when Styres appeared. Little was known about him or Grand River Enterprises.
 ''When word got out that Curt was looking into a team, there was always speculation and perception and innuendos,'' said Jim Jennings, commissioner of the National Lacrosse League. ''We looked into all those aspects and everything was unfounded.''
 Styres would not discuss finances except to say Grand River Enterprises made seven billion cigarettes in 2007. Although Styres did not disclose the company's income, cartons of its cigarette brands typically sell for $12 to $17 apiece, meaning sales probably totaled hundreds of millions of dollars. Grand River filed a lawsuit against the United States in 2005, claiming the government violated the terms of Nafta in its dealings with the company, which is seeking $310 million to $646 million in damages. The matter is in arbitration.
 Regarding questions about his business, Styres said: ''I don't care what anybody else thinks. I do what I think is best for our people. How can I help them?''
 Styres has taken a similar hands-on approach to improving the Knighthawks. Last week he made a trade with the Edmonton Rush for Troy Bonterre, a bruising 6-foot-3, 260-pound defenseman.
 He said he expected the Americans to play a hard-nosed style, too. He has talked to Jacques Martin, Florida's general manager, about adding enforcers to the roster. The approach is based on his experience in running a racetrack.
 When Styres and his brother Glenn opened the speedway, they struggled to fill the stands. To lure spectators, they guaranteed at least one rollover on race nights. If there is not one, his brother, a champion driver, rolls his own car.
 The recognition that there can be entertainment value in carnage will extend to the Knighthawks and the Americans. Asked what fans can expect next year, Styres said, ''Let's just say there will be a lot of rollovers.''

HEADLINE: Google and Yahoo Defend Ad Alliance at a Hearing

BYLINE: By AUSTIN BOGUES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 GOOGLE and Yahoo lawyers defended their recent decision to partner on advertising Tuesday at a Congressional hearing, arguing that the arrangement did not violate antitrust laws and would help to keep Yahoo competitive. 
 Their arguments were countered by Microsoft officials who argued that the partnership would allow Google and Yahoo to dominate more than 90 percent of the search advertising market and could significantly raise prices.
 ''I never felt so sorry for poor little old Microsoft,'' said Representative John Conyers Jr., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to laughter. 
 In a statement, Bradford L. Smith, senior vice president and general counsel of Microsoft, said: ''If search is the gateway to the Internet, and most believe that it is, this deal will put Google in a position to own that gateway and the information that flows through it. When Yahoo talks about this deal generating up to $800 million in additional revenue, that's money out of the pockets of American businesses, big and small, who will pay higher prices for the very same ads they buy from Yahoo today.'' 
 Earlier in the morning, gasps were heard throughout the hearing room when Mr. Smith testified under oath about a meeting on June 8 with Yahoo's chief executive, Jerry Yang, in San Jose, Calif. 
 ''Jerry Yang looked across the table, looked us in the eye and said: 'Look, the search market today is basically a bipolar market. On one pole there's Google, and on the other pole there is Yahoo and Microsoft both competing with Google,' '' Mr. Smith said. 
 ''He said, 'If we do this deal with Google, Yahoo will become part of Google's pole.' And Microsoft, he said, would not be strong enough in this market to remain a pole of its own,'' Mr. Smith continued. 
 Michael J. Callahan, executive vice president and general counsel for Yahoo, said, ''I am not going to address Mr. Smith's characterization of Mr. Yang's statement.'' He later said that he was at the same meeting but did not recall the conversation the way Mr. Smith did. 
 In written testimony Mr. Callahan said Microsoft had turned to Carl C. Icahn, the activist investor, to force a ''fire sale'' of Yahoo. 
 ''Our priority is to build value for stockholders,'' Mr. Callahan said. ''What we will not do, however, is allow our business to be dismantled or sold off piecemeal on terms that would be disadvantageous to Yahoo stockholders and to the market as a whole.'' 
 Mr. Callahan also said that the agreement did not affect ''algorithmic'' search results, maintaining that they would remain entirely Yahoo's. 
 Senator Patrick J. Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the business plan ''raises the specter that one company will accumulate vast amounts of personal viewing data.'' 
 Mr. Smith echoed that concern, arguing that Google would have a complete picture of Internet users' online activities. ''If that happens, Congress won't need to enact a federal privacy policy,'' he said. ''We will already have a national privacy policy -- Google's privacy policy.'' 
 David C. Drummond, senior vice president and chief legal officer for Google, fired back at Microsoft, saying it was not known for being a ''mom and pop shop.'' 
 ''Microsoft has a long history of abusing and extending its dominant positions through anticompetitive practices,'' he said in a statement. ''For years, Microsoft has been working to leverage that lock-in onto the freer and more open world of the Internet.'' 
 Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, said that more information would be needed to reach a conclusion about the deal. 
 ''The history of the development of the computer industry gives us reason to be cautious as we evaluate this deal,'' Mr. Kohl said. ''A decade ago, today's witness, Microsoft, came dangerously close to quashing competition throughout the high-tech economy. We're pleased that Microsoft has reformed its business practices.''

HEADLINE: Johnson & Johnson Net Rises 8%

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The health care giant Johnson & Johnson beat Wall Street expectations on Tuesday with an 8 percent jump in second-quarter profit.
 The company reported sharply higher sales of consumer products, including a new nonprescription allergy pill, Zyrtec, and medical devices like Acuvue contact lenses for astigmatism patients and surgical products for treating obesity. 
 For the first time, international sales topped United States sales for the company, which makes contraceptives, medical devices, baby care items and prescription drugs. Favorable currency exchange rates accounted for almost two-thirds of the increased sales, but the chief financial officer, Dominic J. Caruso, told analysts in a conference call that the weak global economy was not hurting revenue.
 The company, based in New Brunswick, N.J., posted net income of $3.33 billion, or $1.17 a share, compared with $3.08 billion, or $1.05 a share, in the second quarter of 2007.
 Revenue totaled $16.45 billion, up 9 percent.
 Analysts polled by Thomson Financial, on average, expected only $1.12 a share, on revenue of $16 billion.
 Johnson & Johnson shares rose $1.29, to $67.70 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Sales of medical devices and diagnostics, led by joint replacements and diabetes and vision care items, jumped 12 percent, to $6.07 billion.
 Consumer sales rose 13 percent, to $4.04 billion, led by jumps in baby and dental care items and over-the-counter medicines, including Zyrtec, which became available without a prescription in January in the United States. Heavily advertised, it already has taken 27 percent of the nonprescription allergy market.
 Total pharmaceutical sales increased 3 percent, to $6.34 billion.
 Johnson & Johnson raised its full-year profit forecast by a nickel, to $4.45 to $4.50 a share, excluding one-time items.

HEADLINE: Profit Rises 25% at Intel On Strong Global Demand

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Finally, some good news for Wall Street.
 Despite high gas prices and widespread fears of an economic downturn, Intel, the largest chip maker, reported a sharp rise in profit on Tuesday and said strong demand worldwide for computer chips would continue in the current quarter.
 ''Independent of the climate, we had a great second quarter,'' Stacy J. Smith, Intel's chief financial officer, said in an interview on Tuesday. ''What we're seeing is pretty strong demand.'' 
 The company said its net income for the quarter rose 25 percent to $1.6 billion, or 28 cents a share, from the year-ago quarter. 
 The company said revenue rose 9 percent to $9.5 billion for the second quarter that ended June 30.
 The net income was well above the expectations of Wall Street analysts, who had projected earnings of 25 cents a share and revenue of $9.32 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Financial. 
 ''As we enter the second half, demand remains strong for our microprocessor and chipset products in all segments and all parts of the globe,'' Paul S. Otellini, Intel's chief executive, said in a statement.
 Intel's results included $96 million in revamping charges, rather than the $250 million in charges it had previously expected. 
 Intel's gross margin, a closely watched barometer of profitability, rose to 55.4 percent, slightly lower than the roughly 56 percent the company had predicted, but an improvement over 46.9 percent in the year-ago period and 53.8 percent in the first quarter. 
 Intel executives said the company had missed its projections because computer makers shifted to lower-priced chips, like the Atom processor that is used in low-cost mini-notebook PCs known as netbooks.
 Despite its optimism, Intel's missing its target on profit margins tempered Wall Street analysts' enthusiasm. Intel shares rose only slightly in after-hours trading to $20.95. Before the earnings report was released, the stock had increased 24 cents to close at $20.71.
 ''Intel is executing as well as they have in 10 or 15 years,'' said Cody Acree, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus. 
 Mr. Acree added that electronics were proving to be somewhat immune to much of the slowdown that is hitting other consumer products. ''This is a segment of the economy that is continuing to see very resilient demand,'' he said, pointing to the huge sales of the AppleiPhone 3G last week. 
 In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Otellini said that notebook sales overtook sales of desktop computers for the first time during the second quarter, faster than expected. ''The crossover happened six months sooner than we thought,'' he said.
 Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has been buoyed lately by a wave of new products. The new Atom processor takes Intel into a high-growth sector that analysts hope will open up markets in emerging countries while expanding the company's market in the United States. 
 On Monday, the company released the second generation of its Centrino mobile technology, which offers higher performance and faster Wi-Fi than the 2003 original while using far less power. Analysts expect the product to further bolster Intel's mobile division.
 Mr. Otellini said that the company was continuing to take steps to alleviate the problem of an oversupply of NAND flash-memory chips, which drove down prices, but he declined to elaborate on the measures.
 Intel's second-quarter report comes amid broadening concerns about the economy and its impact on demand from consumer and corporate spending. Intel expects revenue in the third quarter could increase as much as 5 percent to $10.6 billion and its gross margin could rise to 58 percent. Analysts have forecast revenue of $10.07 billion, on average. 
 Intel faced some setbacks during the second quarter, including the news that the Federal Trade Commission was formalizing its investigation of Intel's business practices. The company was also fined $25 million by the Fair Trade Commission of South Korea, which charged that it had violated antitrust law there. 
 Still, Intel has continued to benefit from the missteps of its chief rival, Advanced Micro Devices, which for the last year and a half has endured product delays, technical problems and high costs related to its acquisition of the graphics chip maker ATI Technologies. 
 ''I'd be a little surprised if we didn't gain share, but I'll wait for the numbers,'' Mr. Smith said, referring to the industry practice of releasing market share figures immediately after earnings season.
 On Friday, A.M.D. announced it would take $880 million in charges in the second quarter, as well as a $32 million revamping charge, largely from severance payments. In April, A.M.D. posted its sixth consecutive loss; the company is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday.
 During the second quarter, A.M.D. overhauled its mobile chip lineup, giving investors hope that its competitive position could improve.

HEADLINE: Behind Walls of Warehouses, a Trove of Artwork

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
At the same time that art museums and galleries have developed larger collections, they have fewer options to expand. Perhaps inevitably, an art services industry that has sprung up in the dark warehouses of New York City's boroughs is also growing.
 Many museums now farm out the highly specialized business of packaging, shipping and installing art, along with the task of storing it for long periods. 
 A handful of companies that handle these fine art services have also developed into ''arts campuses,'' where art conservators, gallery registrars, academics and collectors can visit to view, catalog, photograph and repair art.
 In the last five years, SurroundArt, a fine arts company with headquarters in Washington, has expanded its New York operations from a single 8,000-square-foot shop in the Brooklyn Navy Yard to what will soon be a campus covering 175,000 square feet in three buildings. 
 It is moving into a new building next month and expects to take possession of the Navy Yard's restored Paymaster building within the next year.
 The buildings will be used to construct crates for shipping the art and to store fine art in spaces controlled for temperature and humidity, with security that is almost as tight as a bank's. There will also be viewing rooms where art world insiders can see the art.
 SurroundArt will occupy an 89,000-square-foot structure where construction was begun speculatively by the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation.
 ''The Navy Yard's been a great place for us, because it's allowed us access to fairly low-cost real estate, at least in the past, and it was easy for us to expand,'' said Mick Murray, a partner and the chief executive at SurroundArt, which will pay annual rent of about $20 a square foot in the new building. Typically, it is $12 a square foot for industrial space in that part of Brooklyn. 
 ''Because it's a gated industrial park, we have security here 24-7, so we can create access any time of day or night for our clients,'' Mr. Murray said. The company has a 20-year lease.
 The new building, which is costing the Navy Yard about $25 million, is said to be the first multistory ''green'' industrial building with multiple tenants in the nation, the development corporation said. Among its environmental features, it will have solar panels and wind turbines on its roof, providing power. SurroundArt's clients can sublease either general space or segregated vaults for art storage.
 Fine art services is one industry that must be very clean for art conservation purposes, Mr. Murray said, so it can benefit from the cleaner construction materials used in green buildings and from the controlled environment.
 Mr. Murray said that fine art services companies like SurroundArt basically house museum-quality collections, even though they are often in nondescript warehouses in industrial areas. 
 ''We've recreated the environment that's inside a museum,'' said Mr. Murray, who is being assisted by the firm Steven Kratchman Architect on designing the new building's interiors.
 Besides keeping a constant temperature of 70 degrees and humidity level of 50 percent, SurroundArt will minimize exposure of the artwork to natural light by covering windows with cheap and durable hurricane shutters. 
 As an adjunct to the security provided by the Navy Yard, SurroundArt has several layers of its own, including armored walls, motion sensors, security cameras, alarm systems and other devices that alert security workers to intruders, fire or environmental changes.
 ''You can have one thing in your warehouse, and it was worth $100,000 three years ago, and now somebody's going to tell you it's worth $17 million,'' Mr. Murray said. ''The auction market really has inflated values in this business.''
 Packaging standards have risen accordingly. Making crates requires a clean room in which a sterile padded armature is fashioned for the artwork, which will be placed in an internal box that has been heat-treated to prevent insect infestations. 
 Like most art services businesses, SurroundArt has a fleet of secure trucks for shipping art.
 Mr. Murray said he decided to form his business while working in the design and production group of the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution.
 ''We got a lot of telephone calls from private collectors saying, 'I bought a piece of art -- what's the proper way to install it?' or 'Where can I get a pedestal?' '' he said. ''Recognizing a need, I took two other fellows with me, and we founded SurroundArt.
 ''We were thinking we'd service the private sector, but within a week of starting the company, my largest account was the Smithsonian Institution.''
 A competitor of SurroundArt in the Bronx, Transcon International Incorporated, handles the art and collectibles of mostly private collectors, galleries and estates, and is also planning an expansion. Transcon's principals said they thought that private collectors, auction houses and galleries were the main reasons for the rapid growth in the art services industry.
 ''The explosion that's been seen by all the shippers in terms of volume and in storage has largely been gunned by the commercial end of it,'' said Michael Blodget, the chief executive of Transcon.
 John Mullane, Transcon's president, founded it as a moving company in the 1970s but, after a decade, recognized a growing demand for fine art services.
 After four years at its current location, Transcon recently renewed its lease for four of six floors for 29 years in a 140,000-square-foot former manufacturing building, which occupies a city block in an area where industrial rents range from $10 to $15 a square foot. When it is available, Transcon will take the whole building. 
 It makes its shipping crates in a nearby 20,000-square-foot building. 
 The company will soon build a $5 million one- or two-story expansion in its parking lot with ceilings of 20 feet or more to handle large artworks.
 Though the expansion is in effect a speculative development, Mr. Mullane said he was confident that he could fill the new space with art. ''We have interest from a lot of institutions and clients,'' he said. ''We're still busy, though I consider we're in a recession right now. We could fill it up -- no problem.''

HEADLINE: Seeing Bad Loans, Investors Flee From Bank Shares

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
On Wall Street, the run is on. 
 Bank stocks spun wildly on Tuesday in another bruising day for financial companies. Goaded by bearish analysts, investors seem to be abandoning American banks in droves. 
 While a fraction of the nation's banks are expected to buckle under their growing burden of bad loans, federal regulators, bank executives and analysts agree that the vast majority of institutions are sound. Bank customers are not panicking, particularly since most of their deposits are insured.
 But shareholders, whose investments are by no means guaranteed, are running scared. It is becoming increasingly clear that even the strongest banks will be grappling with bad loans for years -- and that the outlook for the industry could worsen further if the economy and the housing market continue to weaken. The collapse of IndyMac Bancorp last week fanned long-smoldering worries that even healthy banks confront significant challenges. 
 The marketplace is passing harsh judgment on an industry that was a darling of Wall Street when home prices and mortgage lending boomed in recent years. The mood darkened further on Tuesday, when the Wachovia Corporation was compelled to assert that it was sound as its share price was swept lower for a fifth day. Wachovia fell nearly 8 percent, leaving it down 76 percent this year. 
 The 12-stock Standard & Poor's 500 Regional Banks index sank nearly 4 percent, extending its 11 percent decline from Monday. Financial companies like the American International Group, Bank of America and Citigroup pulled the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 1 percent. 
 It is a stark reversal of fortune for the banking industry, and for regional lenders in particular. Many regional banks, big enough to have some heft, but small enough to be managed effectively, rode the mortgage boom to higher profits. Many avoided the alphabet soup of complex debt investments that have cost big banks tens of billions of dollars. 
 Only a year ago, many of these banks looked like attractive takeover targets, and investors placed hefty premiums to their share prices. 
 Now all of that has changed, and the missteps the banks made in good times are glaring. Investors are recoiling from banks that overreached with what turned out to be ill-fated acquisitions. Lenders that need to raise capital are also being shunned, as are those that have made many loans to builders. 
 ''The whole allure of regional banks has gone out of fashion,'' said David Hendler, a research analyst at Credit Sights in New York. ''They used to have the best perfume in the business. Now, they have an odor.'' 
 The National City Corporation of Cleveland, for example, expanded into Florida just before the bottom fell out of the housing market there. The bank recently raised $7 billion to shore up its finances, and said on Monday that its Tier 1 capital ratio, an important measure of a bank's financial health, ranked among the highest in its class. A bank must have a capital ratio of 6 percent to be considered well-capitalized. 
 Despite such assurances, National City has lost nearly 90 percent of its value in the last year. It sank 4.5 percent on Tuesday
 Other banks that once seemed like attractive takeover targets now look like pariahs. SunTrust Banks of Atlanta, which was soaring a year ago on hopes that it might be acquired at a lofty price, has plummeted nearly 70 percent this year, as the prospect of a sale has been mired in losses. A year ago, SunTrust, rumored to be a target of JPMorgan Chase, was trading at 1.5 times the value of the assets on its books. Today, it fetches a mere 0.5 times book value. 
 Given the turmoil in the markets, some banks are struggling to raise capital from investors. So far, most investors who have bought into financial companies in the hope that the worst was over have lost big. 
 Of 52 fund-raising efforts tracked by Goldman Sachs, investors have come out ahead at only two banks -- Fifth Third of Cincinnati and Western Alliance of Las Vegas -- where they injected money. The average deal was down 45 percent. 
 Investors are reluctant to sink more money into regional banks, fearing their investments will be diluted if the banks sell even more stock. 
 Even the whiff of bad news can send a stock falling. Zions Bancorporation, a Utah-based lender which barreled into construction lending in once-hot markets like Nevada and California, planned to use its in-house brokerage arm to raise $150 million in a series of deals. But when it raised only about $47 million in its first attempt, investors concluded the bank was struggling to raise cash.
 ''The stock has literally cratered,'' said Richard X. Bove, a prominent banking analyst. ''It has just fallen apart.'' 
 There were some bright spots on Tuesday. Shares of the First Horizon National Corporation, the largest bank in Tennessee, jumped nearly 17 percent after the bank's chief executive offered assurances that the bank has enough capital. The stock is still down 67 percent this year. 
 As the losses deepen, many investors are asking the same question: Where's the bottom? 
 Chip MacDonald, the banking lawyer at Jones Day, said the rapid sell-off and the Treasury Department's actions to shore up the mortgage finance companies might suggest the market is about to turn the corner. ''I think the events of the last week might be a sign,'' he said. Many others see just another false bottom.

But the seizure of IndyMac Bank last week by federal regulators pushed one measure of the problem -- assets at failed banks -- to its highest level since the early 1990s.

HEADLINE: The Daily News And The Post Talk Business

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns The New York Post, and Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the real estate developer and owner of The Daily News, who for years have been bitter tabloid competitors, are considering the unthinkable: cooperation.
 Representatives of Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Murdoch have been in discussions for several weeks to find ways to combine some business functions of The Daily News and The Post, according to people briefed on the matter. They spoke anonymously because the talks are at a delicate stage and both sides had hoped they would remain confidential.
 Talks between the two papers began in earnest in May after the announcement of a deal to sell Newsday, the Long Island daily, to the Cablevision Systems Corporation for $650 million. Both Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Zuckerman had bid for Newsday, which was being sold by the debt-laden Tribune Company. Each had offered $580 million and was unwilling to match Cablevision's higher price.
 One executive involved in the talks between The Post and The Daily News described them as ''preliminary,'' but said both sides were committed to reaching an agreement. The talks have not yet involved Mr. Murdoch's and Mr. Zuckerman's meeting face to face. 
 Representatives for Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Zuckerman declined to comment.
 In addition to a broader pact between The Post and The Daily News, the two newspapers and The Wall Street Journal, which is also owned by the News Corporation, are considering combining home delivery operations to save money, and have sought bids from vendors.
 Speaking only about this aspect, Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for the participating newspapers, said: ''The request for proposal is an opportunity we are jointly exploring to lower costs, improve efficiency and strengthen our respective newspapers.''
 Lawyers for the newspapers are trying to find a structure for an agreement that would not require a joint operating agreement -- a mechanism other papers have used that would require creating a separate entity with a separate board and essentially mean merging all business functions while maintaining separate newsrooms.
 Instead, the talks have centered on combining printing, distribution and other back-office functions, while maintaining separate companies and news staffs, in an effort to cut millions in annual costs. 
 One important hurdle is deciding which newspaper's printing presses would be used. Several years ago The Post invested nearly $300 million in a new printing plant in the South Bronx. In February The Daily News announced a large investment that would make it the first major newspaper in the country able to print color on every page.
 The Post loses an estimated $50 million a year. The Daily News roughly breaks even. Mr. Murdoch had sought a joint venture with Newsday, an arrangement that could have wiped out The Post's losses. A deal with The Daily News would not make The Post instantly profitable, but it would be an incremental step toward eliminating the paper's losses.
 It is not the first time the rivals have talked about sharing costs. In 1999, the papers held exploratory talks, and the issue has been broached at various times over the years. Now, according to the executive involved in the talks, the discussion has become more urgent, given the sagging economics of the industry. This executive said the impetus for the discussions was ''the realities of the modern newspaper business.''
 The talks underscore the deteriorating economics of the industry, which faces declining circulation and a flight of advertising dollars to the Internet. Heavy traffic to the newspapers' own Web sites means a larger audience for the content that papers produce, but increases in Internet advertising have failed to make up for losses in revenue from print advertising.
 ''If you look at any other industry out there, you'd see shared services,'' said Alan L. Marx, a lawyer at King & Ballow in Nashville who has worked on many newspaper joint operating agreements.
 While the New York tabloids are searching for an arrangement that falls short of a full joint operating agreement, any business cooperation between them could bring legal scrutiny.
 Mr. Marx said that sharing printing costs and making joint purchases of materials like paper and ink would present few legal issues. When papers discuss joint advertising sales -- it is unclear whether this is under discussion by The Post and The Daily News -- they risk coming under scrutiny for anticompetitive practices.
 ''The only area you get into potential issues would be the sales side, with prices,'' he said.
 Formal joint operating agreements have existed as far back as the 1930s, but became relatively common after the enactment of the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970. 
 ''The rationale for the Newspaper Preservation Act was maintaining two distinct editorial voices,'' with the idea that was a public benefit, said Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at the Poynter Institute, a journalism training center in St. Petersburg, Fla.
 Over the years there have been 28 joint operating agreements around the country, but now, according to the Newspaper Association of America, there are fewer than 10.
 ''J.O.A.'s have not worked very well,'' Mr. Edmonds said. ''I think one of the things that often goes wrong on a J.O.A. is when there is a stronger paper and a weaker paper, you usually get to the point where the stronger paper is not supporting the weaker paper in terms of circulation and advertising.''
 Working together on the business side would present a stark cultural shift for the papers' news staffs, each accustomed to seeing the other side as the enemy. Rumors that the two rivals might be in business together have already set off whispering in the Post newsroom and cocktail chatter in Mr. Zuckerman's and Mr. Murdoch's media mogul circles -- it was one point of gossip during the recent Allen & Company conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.
 Their rivalry goes beyond competing for scoops and the best photographs of New York City's crime scenes. 
 Each paper gleefully, and often, reports with verve about the other's internal gossip and the foibles of its prominent owner. The Post refers to its rival in print as the ''Daily Snooze,'' and in 2004 it published a nearly 4,000-word article that accused The Daily News of inflating its circulation figures. (The Daily News later accused The Post of dumping thousands of papers at recycling facilities in Brooklyn.)
 In 2006, when a contributor to The Post's Page Six gossip column was accused of trying to use extortion against the investor Ronald W. Burkle, The Daily News named the scandal ''Page Sick'' and ''Page Fix.''
 On the circulation front, The Post briefly zoomed ahead of The Daily News in 2006, in part because The Post cut its newsstand price to 25 cents. When The Post surpassed its rival, its front page blared, ''Post Makes History: Beats News.'' (The Post recently raised its price to 50 cents on weekdays.)
 The most recent circulation figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations, released in April, show the papers roughly equal on weekdays: The Daily News comes in at 703,137, while The Post is at 702,488. On Sunday The Daily News has a substantial lead: 704,157 compared with 401,315 for The Post.

HEADLINE: Debating Rebates and Bailouts A Rescue for Fannie and Freddie Kindles Opposition and Political Duels

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's plan to rescue the nation's two largest mortgage finance companies ran into sharp criticism in Congress on Tuesday as some lawmakers questioned the open-ended request for money that could be used to help the companies. 
 The criticism prompted House leaders to push back their timetable for approving emergency housing legislation, saying final action would take at least until early next week. A growing number of Republicans had voiced skepticism and, in some cases, angry opposition, to the administration's proposal to help the two companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 It was unclear whether the criticism was hand-wringing before Congress ultimately adopted the rescue package or whether it meant a delay or that major changes to the proposal were in the works.
 The Republican opposition threatened to incite an ugly intramural fight with the White House. In a high-stakes election year, the resistance reflected the deep fear among some lawmakers that the plan could set off a large taxpayer bailout, touching off a wave of voter anger in November. 
 For some lawmakers facing tough re-election contests, opposing the rescue plan is a way to reaffirm their identity as budget hawks while publicly breaking with a deeply unpopular lame-duck administration.
 The rescue plan, which was hastily prepared over the weekend after a punishing week in the stock market for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, calls on Congress to give the administration the authority for up to 18 months to inject billions of dollars into either company through investments and loans. 
 Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary and the proposal's architect, insisted on Tuesday that he had no plan to make any immediate investments or loans, but that he simply wanted to send a signal to jittery financial markets that the companies had the support of the United States government. 
 While administration officials continued to express confidence that Congress would act soon, the day's events suggested that the lawmakers might impose some limits on the plan. 
 President Bush told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday morning that it was vital for Congress to act soon. ''I urge members to move quickly to enact the plan in its entirety,'' Mr. Bush said. ''These two enterprises play a central role in our housing finance system.''
 His views were supported by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, who said he expected that the administration's proposal would be included in the housing package and that he expected it would be approved sooner rather than later.
 ''I'm optimistic we are going to complete the process this week,'' Mr. McConnell said, ''and also optimistic that the administration's recommendations are going to be part of it.'' 
 As other Republicans voiced their concerns, however, Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic majority leader in the House, said he expected that hearings would have to be held and that the House would not vote on the bill before next Tuesday.
 At a Senate hearing Tuesday, Mr. Paulson found himself on the defensive as Democrats and Republicans repeatedly asked him how he could expect Congress to give him -- and his successor -- a blank check. 
 Mr. Paulson walked lawmakers through his logic. By giving him the authority to spend an unlimited amount of money, he said, the markets would accept that the government's commitment is solid, and that would increase confidence.
 In turn, that would significantly decrease the odds that the government would need to spend any money at all. 
 ''If you've got a squirt gun in your pocket you may have to take it out,'' he said. ''If you've got a bazooka, and people know you have it, then you may not have to take it out. By making it unspecified, it will greatly expand the likelihood it will not have to be used.''
 But the logic did not seem appealing to several Republicans and Democrats on the banking committee, who raised concerns about taxpayer exposure, and left unspoken the view that Congress would not quickly surrender the power of the purse.
 ''You don't want to put a dollar amount -- I understand the reasons for ambiguity and not stating things,'' said Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the committee. ''I think you are risking taxpayer dollars here. To give you -- we have respect for you at Treasury -- a blank check? I'm not so sure. We'll have to talk.'' 
 Mr. Shelby added, ''I fear we're sitting on a financial powder keg.''
 Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, said he had some concerns about the plan.
 ''How is it that we can tell the taxpayers that there is no way you are going to be put on the hook here?'' he asked.
 Some lawmakers viewed the unlimited financing request as the administration's opening negotiating position. It also reflected a political budget reality. If the administration were to put a specific dollar request in the plan, it could force budget officials to recognize that amount on the government's books, adding to the deficit or possibly leading lawmakers to insist, under the pay-as-you-go rule, to raise taxes or cut spending elsewhere. 
 The strongest criticism came from Republicans.
 ''When I picked up my newspaper yesterday, I thought I woke up in France,'' Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, said at the hearing. ''But no, it turns out socialism is alive and well in America.''
 Mr. Bunning complained that Mr. Paulson would be gone in January, while most lawmakers ''will be sitting at the table'' left paying the bill.
 ''You want an unlimited amount and some of us at this table don't like an unlimited amount of federal dollars,'' Mr. Bunning said in a particularly testy exchange. ''Do you really think we can believe exactly what you are saying, Secretary Paulson?''
 ''I believe everything I say,'' Mr. Paulson replied. ''I've been around markets for a long time.'' 
 ''So have I,'' Mr. Bunning angrily responded. ''Where will the money come from if, in fact, we have to use the backstop?''
 After Mr. Paulson replied that he did not think any money would be needed, Mr. Bunning said, ''That doesn't answer my question. Where is the money going to come from?''
 ''From the government,'' Mr. Paulson said.
 ''And who is the government?'' Mr. Bunning asked.
 ''The taxpayer,'' Mr. Paulson said. 
 Mr. Paulson suggested that if Mr. Bunning did not like the plan, he should vote against it.
 ''I will do everything I can to stop it,'' Mr. Bunning said, referring to the Treasury's plan. 
 ''And maybe you can come up with a better plan,'' Mr. Paulson tartly replied. 
 Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, asked why the companies' management should not be held accountable.
 Mr. Paulson responded that since the companies were in one line of business and had not been lax in their lending standards, there was no reason to take it out on the executives.
 ''My experience with the management has been a constructive experience,'' he said. ''I'm not looking for scapegoats here.''
 Across the Capitol, meanwhile, Republican lawmakers, including the House minority leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, the party whip; Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri; and the senior Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, Spencer Bachus of Alabama, all urged Democrats to take more time to go over the administration's proposal.
 Democrats,who found themselves in an unusual alliance with the Bush administration, immediately criticized the Republicans for endangering the economy by trying to stall the housing legislation.
 Democratic leaders have said they would incorporate the Treasury plan to aid the mortgage giants into a package of housing legislation that includes a plan to help hundreds of thousands of borrowers at risk of foreclosure to refinance their mortgages. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, and one of the authors of the housing legislation, had initially predicted that the House would add the administration's plan and act on the housing package this week.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Resistance May Delay Housing Legislation

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Democratic Congressional leaders on Tuesday pushed back their timetable for approving emergency housing legislation after Republicans voiced growing skepticism and, in some cases, angry opposition to the Bush administration's proposal to rescue Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered mortgage finance companies. 
 Republican lawmakers -- including the House minority leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio; the party whip, Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri; and the senior Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, Spencer Bachus of Alabama -- all urged Democrats to take more time to go over the administration's proposal, including committee hearings and a chance for lawmakers to offer amendments to any legislation.
 ''The sweeping changes contemplated in the proposal made by the Treasury Department over the weekend represent a far-reaching overhaul of the financial regulatory structure of our housing market,'' Mr. Bachus wrote in a letter to Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is the chairman of the Financial Services Committee and is a main author of the housing legislation.
 ''Making such broad changes in a precipitous manner without adequate study and analysis is unprecedented and, perhaps, unnecessary,'' Mr. Bachus wrote.
 Democrats, who found themselves in an unusual alliance with the Bush administration, immediately criticized the Republicans endangering the global economy by trying to stall the housing legislation. They said it would take until early next week, at least, for the House to act.
 The reluctance by Republicans to embrace President Bush's plan came as shares in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac plunged again on Tuesday, raising the chances that the federal government might need to take over the companies -- a prospect that some fiscal conservative lawmakers likened to socialism.
 ''When I picked up my newspaper yesterday, I thought I woke up in France,'' Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, said at a banking committee hearing. ''But no, it turns out socialism is alive and well in America.''
 The Republican opposition threatened to ignite an ugly fight with the White House that many G.O.P. lawmakers view as an increasing liability in a high-stakes election year. For some lawmakers facing tough re-election contests, opposing the rescue plan for the mortgage giants is a way to reaffirm their identity as budgetary hawks while publicly breaking with the deeply unpopular, lame-duck Bush administration.
 In the Senate, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, said he had numerous questions about the administration's proposal but he stopped short of expressing opposition to it. ''I fear that we're sitting on a financial powder keg,'' Mr. Shelby said.
 Democratic leaders have said they would incorporate the Treasury Department's plan to aid the mortgage giants into a package of housing legislation that also includes a plan to help hundreds of thousands of borrowers at risk of foreclosure to refinance their mortgages. Mr. Frank had initially predicted that the House would add the administration's plan and act on the housing package this week.
 But as Republicans voiced their concerns on Tuesday, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic majority leader, said he expected that hearings would have to be held and that the House would not vote on the bill until next Tuesday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoy to Join Meeting With Iranian

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush has authorized the most significant American diplomatic contact with Iran since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, sending the State Department's third-ranking official to Geneva for a meeting this weekend on Iran's nuclear program, administration officials said Tuesday. 
 The decision appeared to bend, if not exactly break, the administration's insistence that it would not negotiate with Iran over its nuclear programs unless it first suspended uranium enrichment, as demanded by three resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. 
 Still, after months of accusations and counteraccusations from the United States and Iran, the meeting raised the prospect of an intensified diplomatic push to resolve concerns over Iranian nuclear activity, not unlike the lengthy and painstaking talks that resulted in a deal last month with North Korea. 
 William J. Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, will attend a meeting on Saturday with the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, and Iran's nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, a senior administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of an official announcement on Wednesday. 
 At the meeting, Mr. Jalili is expected to present Iran's formal response to a package of economic and diplomatic incentives that Germany and the Security Council's five permanent members, Russia, China, France, Britain and the United States, presented Iran in June. Representatives from those countries will also attend the meeting. 
 The United States did not have a representative at the June meeting.
 The package, which revived an earlier European offer to provide civilian nuclear assistance and increased trade, met at first with official disdain in Iran but has since prompted conflicting signals among senior Iranian officials. That led the administration to conclude that there could be more chance of a diplomatic resolution than some Iranian declarations and a battery of missile tests last week suggested. 
 Mr. Bush approved the contact ''to press the advantage,'' a second official said. The officials emphasized that Mr. Burns's participation was a one-time decision, that he would not meet one-on-one with Mr. Jalili and that he would reiterate the administration's demand that Iran suspend uranium enrichment. 
 The United States, along with some other countries, contends that the enrichment activity is part of an effort to build nuclear weapons, which Iran denies. 
 Clifford Kupchan of the Eurasia Group, a consultancy in Washington, said the meeting, even with strict limits, was ''a much-needed and an extremely welcome correction'' in the Bush administration's policy. 
 He said that there was now at least ''a perception of opportunity'' that the international confrontation over Iran could be resolved without war. 
 Mr. Kupchan said that the meeting would be the highest-level contact for Iran with the United States since the revolution, and that, more important, it would deal with the fundamental dispute between Iran and the international community. 
 ''Disclaimers notwithstanding,'' he added, ''the precondition that Iran must suspend before the U.S. will talk about the nuclear issue will by every standard have been dropped.''
 After nearly three decades of isolation and hostility, American and Iranian ambassadors have met to discuss security matters in Iraq. Last year, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her Iranian counterpart, Manouchehr Mottaki, both attended a regional conference in Egypt, sitting in the same room but not meeting. 
 The administration has repeatedly said Ms. Rice was prepared to hold talks with Iran anywhere on any subject, provided that the country first stop enrichment. 
 The decision to allow the contact follows what Mr. Bush and other administration officials have described as a strategy to intensify sanctions and other punitive measures while offering Iran the prospect of easing its isolation. 
 ''The message to the Iranian government is very clear: that there's a better way forward than isolation, and that is for you to verifiably suspend your enrichment program,'' Mr. Bush said in Germany last month, rebutting reports that he was determined to confront Iran militarily. ''And the choice is theirs to make.''

HEADLINE: So Popular And So Spineless

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Much ink has been spilled lately decrying the decline in American popularity around the world under President Bush. Polls tell us how China is now more popular in Asia than America and how few Europeans say they identify with the United States. I am sure there is truth to these polls. We should have done better in Iraq. An America that presides over Abu Ghraib, torture and Guantanamo Bay deserves a thumbs-down.
 But America is not and never has been just about those things, which is why I also find some of these poll results self-indulgent, knee-jerk and borderline silly. Friday's vote at the U.N. on Zimbabwe reminded me why. 
 Maybe Asians, Europeans, Latin Americans and Africans don't like a world of too much American power -- ''Mr. Big'' got a little too big for them. But how would they like a world of too little American power? With America's overextended military and overextended banks, that is the world into which we may be heading.
 Welcome to a world of too much Russian and Chinese power.
 I am neither a Russia-basher nor a China-basher. But there was something truly filthy about Russia's and China's vetoes of the American-led U.N. Security Council effort to impose targeted sanctions on Robert Mugabe's ruling clique in Zimbabwe. 
 The U.S. put forward a simple Security Council resolution, calling for an arms embargo on Zimbabwe, the appointment of a U.N. mediator, plus travel and financial restrictions on the dictator Mugabe and 13 top military and government officials for stealing the Zimbabwe election and essentially mugging an entire country in broad daylight.
 In the first round of Zimbabwe's elections, on March 29, the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, won nearly 48 percent of the vote compared with 42 percent for Mugabe. This prompted Mugabe and his henchmen to begin a campaign of killing and intimidation against Tsvangirai supporters that eventually forced the opposition to pull out of the second-round runoff vote just to stay alive. 
 Even before the runoff, Mugabe declared that he would disregard the results if his ZANU-PF party lost. Or as he put it: ''We are not going to give up our country because of a mere X'' on some paper ballot. 
 And so, of course, Mugabe ''won'' in one of the most blatantly stolen elections ever -- in a country already mired in misrule, unemployment, hunger and inflation. Some 25 percent of Zimbabwe's people have now taken refuge in neighboring states. (I have close friends from Zimbabwe, and one of my daughters worked there in an H.I.V.-AIDS community center in January.) The Associated Press reported in May from Zimbabwe ''that annual inflation rose this month to 1,063,572 percent, based on prices of a basket of basic foodstuffs.'' Zimbabwe's currency has become so devalued, the A.P. explained, that ''a loaf of bread now costs what 12 new cars did a decade ago.''
 No matter. Vitaly Churkin, Russia's U.N. ambassador, argued that the targeted sanctions that the U.S. and others wanted to impose on Mugabe's clique exceeded the Security Council's mandate. ''We believe such practices to be illegitimate and dangerous,'' he said, describing the resolution as one more obvious ''attempt to take the Council beyond its charter prerogatives.'' Veto!
 Mugabe's campaign of murder and intimidation didn't strike Churkin as ''illegitimate and dangerous'' -- only the U.N. resolution to bring a halt to it was ''illegitimate and dangerous.'' Shameful. Meanwhile, China is hosting the Olympics, a celebration of the human spirit, while defending Mugabe's right to crush his own people's spirit. 
 But when it comes to pure, rancid moral corruption, no one can top South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, and his stooge at the U.N., Dumisani Kumalo. They have done everything they can to prevent any meaningful U.N. pressure on the Mugabe dictatorship.
 As The Times reported, America's U.N. ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, ''accused South Africa of protecting the 'horrible regime in Zimbabwe,' '' calling this particularly disturbing given that it was precisely international economic sanctions that brought down South Africa's apartheid government, which had long oppressed that country's blacks.
 So let us now coin the Mbeki Rule: When whites persecute blacks, no amount of U.N. sanctions is too much. And when blacks persecute blacks, any amount of U.N. sanctions is too much.
 Which brings me back to America. Perfect we are not, but America still has some moral backbone. There are travesties we will not tolerate. The U.N. vote on Zimbabwe demonstrates that this is not true for these ''popular'' countries -- called Russia or China or South Africa -- who have no problem siding with a man who is pulverizing his own people.
 So, yes, we're not so popular in Europe and Asia anymore. I guess they would prefer a world in which America was weaker, where leaders with the values of Vladimir Putin and Thabo Mbeki had a greater say, and where the desperate voices for change in Zimbabwe would, well, just shut up.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Obama Candidacy Isn't Closing Divide on Race

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MEGAN THEE; Kevin Sack, Dalia Sussman and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Americans are sharply divided by race heading into the first election in which an African-American will be a major-party presidential nominee, with blacks and whites holding vastly different views of Senator Barack Obama, the state of race relations and how black Americans are treated by society, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 The results of the poll, conducted against the backdrop of a campaign in which race has been a constant if not always overt issue, suggested that Mr. Obama's candidacy, while generating high levels of enthusiasm among black voters, is not seen by them as evidence of significant improvement in race relations.
 After years of growing political polarization, much of the divide in American politics is partisan. But Americans' perceptions of the fall presidential election between Mr. Obama, Democrat of Illinois, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, also underlined the racial discord that the poll found. More than 80 percent of black voters said they had a favorable opinion of Mr. Obama; about 30 percent of white voters said they had a favorable opinion of him. 
 Nearly 60 percent of black respondents said race relations were generally bad, compared with 34 percent of whites. Four in 10 blacks say that there has been no progress in recent years in eliminating racial discrimination; fewer than 2 in 10 whites say the same thing. And about one-quarter of white respondents said they thought that too much had been made of racial barriers facing black people, while one-half of black respondents said not enough had been made of racial impediments faced by blacks. 
 The survey suggests that even as the nation crosses a racial threshold when it comes to politics -- Mr. Obama, a Democrat, is the son of a black father from Kenya and a white mother from Kansas -- many of the racial patterns in society remain unchanged in recent years. 
 Indeed, the poll showed markedly little change in the racial components of people's daily lives since 2000, when The Times examined race relations in an extensive series of articles called ''How Race Is Lived in America.'' 
 As it was eight years ago, few Americans have regular contact with people of other races, and few say their own workplaces or their own neighborhoods are integrated. In this latest poll, over 40 percent of blacks said they believed they had been stopped by the police because of their race, the same figure as eight years ago; 7 percent of whites said the same thing. 
 Nearly 70 percent of blacks said they had encountered a specific instance of discrimination based on their race, compared with 62 percent in 2000; 26 percent of whites said they had been the victim of racial discrimination. (Over 50 percent of Hispanics said they had been the victim of racial discrimination.)
 And when asked whether blacks or whites had a better chance of getting ahead in today's society, 64 percent of black respondents said that whites did. That figure was slightly higher even than the 57 percent of blacks who said so in a 2000 poll by The Times. And the number of blacks who described racial conditions as generally bad in this survey was almost identical to poll responses in 2000 and 1990.
 ''Basically it's the same old problem, the desire for power,'' Macie Mitchell, a Pennsylvania Democrat from Erie County, who is black, said in a follow-up interview after participating in the poll. ''People get so obsessed with power and don't want to share it. There are people who are not used to blacks being on top.''
 White perceptions, by contrast, improved markedly from 1990 to 2000, but have remained steady since. This month's poll found that 55 percent of whites said race relations were good, almost double the figure for blacks.
 The nationwide telephone poll was conducted July 7-14 with 1,796 adults, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. In an effort to measure views of different races, the survey included larger-than-usual minority samples -- 297 blacks and 246 Hispanics -- with a margin of sampling error of six percentage points for each subgroup.
 Black and white Americans agree that America is ready to elect a black president, but disagree on almost every other question about race in the poll. 
 Black voters were far more likely than whites to say that Mr. Obama cares about the needs and problems of people like them, and more likely to describe him as patriotic. Whites were more likely than blacks to say that Mr. Obama says what he thinks people want to hear, rather than what he truly believes. And about half of black voters said race relations would improve in an Obama administration, compared with 29 percent of whites.
 About 40 percent of blacks said that Mr. McCain, if elected president, would favor whites over blacks should he win the election. 
 There was even racial dissension over Mr. Obama's wife, Michelle: She was viewed favorably by 58 percent of black voters, compared with 24 percent of white voters. 
 Among black voters, who are overwhelmingly Democrats, Mr. Obama draws support from 89 percent, compared with 2 percent for Mr. McCain. Among whites, Mr. Obama has 37 percent of the vote, compared with 46 percent for Mr. McCain. 
 After a Democratic primary season in which Mr. Obama had difficulty competing for Hispanic votes against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Obama leads Mr. McCain among Hispanic voters in the likely general election matchup by 62 to 23 percent. Mr. Obama is viewed favorably by more than half of Hispanic Americans, compared with Mr. McCain, whose favorability rating is just under one-quarter. By significant margins, these voters believe that Mr. Obama will do a better job of dealing with immigration; Mr. McCain has been trying to distance himself from Republicans who have advocated a tough policy on permitting illegal immigrants to stay in the country.
 Over all, Mr. Obama leads Mr. McCain among all registered voters by 45 percent to 39 percent.
 White voters, much more so than black voters, are divided in their political loyalties. Mr. Obama draws significant support among white Democrats. Yet still, among just Democrats, blacks were more apt than whites in the poll to express positive views of Mr. Obama across a range of questions. For example, black Democrats were 24 points more likely than white Democrats to have a favorable opinion of Mr. Obama.
 ''I don't like some of his policies, like on energy,'' said Bob Beidelman, 69, a white Democrat from York, Pa., about Mr. Obama. ''Also I don't like statements his wife made. She seems like a spoiled brat to me.''
 He added: ''I'm one of those white people who clings to guns and the Bible, and those things that Barack said kind of turned me off,'' he said. ''This isn't a black and white thing. If a conservative African-American like former Congressman J. C. Watts was running, I'd have bumper stickers plastered all over my car supporting him.''
 The survey found extensive excitement among African-Americans about the prospect of Mr. Obama's candidacy, a factor that could prove important in pushing voter turnout. The poll found that 72 percent of black voters said they expected Mr. Obama to win.
 The high levels of enthusiasm for Mr. Obama among black Americans suggested that there was less of a divide among them about his candidacy than suggested by occasional tension among black leaders. Last week, Mr. Obama was criticized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson as ''talking down to black people'' by going before black audiences and urging parents to take more responsibility for their children. 
 ''He's got all these enthusiastic young people working for him,'' said James Wilson, 75, a property manager from Philadelphia who is black. ''I'm a person who would never give money and they called on the phone and got me to give.''
 The poll found that Mr. McCain is yoked to the legacy of President Bush -- majorities believe that Mr. McCain, as president, would continue Mr. Bush's policies in Iraq and on the economy. Mr. Bush's approval rating on the economy is as low as it has been in his presidency, 20 percent; and even while there has been an increase in the number of Americans who think the war is going well, there has been no change in the significantly large number of people who think it was a mistake to have invaded.

HEADLINE: May We Mock, Barack?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 When I interviewed Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert for Rolling Stone a couple years ago, I wondered what Barack Obama would mean for them.
 ''It seems like a President Obama would be harder to make fun of than these guys,'' I said.
 ''Are you kidding me?'' Stewart scoffed. 
 Then he and Colbert both said at the same time: ''His dad was a goat-herder!''
 When I noted that Obama, in his memoir, had revealed that he had done some pot, booze and ''maybe a little blow,'' the two comedians began riffing about the dapper senator's familiarity with drug slang.
 Colbert: Wow, that's a very street way of putting it. 'A little blow.'
 Stewart: A little bit of the white rabbit.
 Colbert: 'Yeah, I packed a cocktail straw of cocaine and had a prostitute blow it in my ear, but that is all I did. High-fivin.' '
 Flash forward to the kerfuffle -- and Obama's icy reaction -- over this week's New Yorker cover parodying fears about the Obamas.
 ''We've already scratched thrift, candor and brevity off the list of virtues in this presidential cycle, so why not eliminate humor, too?'' wrote James Rainey in The Los Angeles Times, suggesting ''an irony deficiency'' in Obama and his fans.
 Many of the late-night comics and their writers -- nearly all white -- now admit to The New York Times's Bill Carter that because of race and because there is nothing ''buffoonish'' about Obama -- and because many in their audiences are intoxicated by him and resistant to seeing him skewered -- he has not been flayed by the sort of ridicule that diminished Dukakis, Gore and Kerry.
 ''There's a weird reverse racism going on,'' Jimmy Kimmel said.
 Carter also observed that there's no easy comedic ''take'' on Obama, ''like allegations of Bill Clinton's womanizing, or President Bush's goofy bumbling or Al Gore's robotic personality.''
 At first blush, it would seem to be a positive for Obama that he is hard to mock. But on second thought, is it another sign that he's trying so hard to be perfect that it's stultifying? Or that eight years of W. and Cheney have robbed Democratic voters of their sense of humor? 
 Certainly, as the potential first black president, and as a contender with tender experience, Obama must feel under strain to be serious. 
 But he does not want the ''take'' on him to become that he's so tightly wrapped, overcalculated and circumspect that he can't even allow anyone to make jokes about him, and that his supporters are so evangelical and eager for a champion to rescue America that their response to any razzing is a sanctimonious: Don't mess with our messiah!
 If Obama keeps being stingy with his quips and smiles, and if the dominant perception of him is that you can't make jokes about him, it might infect his campaign with an airless quality. His humorlessness could spark humor.
 On Tuesday, Andy Borowitz satirized on that subject. He said that Obama, sympathetic to comics' attempts to find jokes to make about him, had put out a list of official ones, including this:
 ''A traveling salesman knocks on the door of a farmhouse, and much to his surprise, Barack Obama answers the door. The salesman says, 'I was expecting the farmer's daughter.' Barack Obama replies, 'She's not here. The farm was foreclosed on because of subprime loans that are making a mockery of the American dream.' ''
 John McCain's Don Rickles routines -- ''Thanks for the question, you little jerk'' -- can fall flat. But he seems like a guy who can be teased harmlessly. If Obama offers only eat-your-arugula chiding and chilly earnestness, he becomes an otherworldly type, not the regular guy he needs to be.
 He's already in danger of seeming too prissy about food -- a perception heightened when The Wall Street Journal reported that the planners for Obama's convention have hired the first-ever Director of Greening, the environmental activist Andrea Robinson. She in turn hired an Official Carbon Adviser to ''measure the greenhouse-gas emissions of every placard, every plane trip, every appetizer prepared and every coffee cup tossed.''
 The ''lean 'n' green'' catering guidelines, The Journal said, bar fried food and instruct that, ''on the theory that nutritious food is more vibrant, each meal should include 'at least three of the following colors: red, green, yellow, blue/purple, and white.' (Garnishes don't count.) At least 70% of the ingredients should be organic or grown locally, to minimize emissions from fuel during transportation.'' 
 Bring it on, Ozone Democrats! Because if Obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him, it won't be the economy that's depressed. It will be the rest of us.

HEADLINE: Anger and Dismay at the Sale of a City Treasure

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS 

 BODY:
With the shades inside a tavern on Pestalozzi Street drawn to block the early morning sun, Dave Liszewski, a third-shift worker at Anheuser-Busch, nursed a bottle of Bud Light and a hollowed sense of pride.
 ''We were betrayed,'' said Mr. Liszewski, who was still not sure he could believe the news that the company had agreed to be sold. ''The good Lord was sold out for 30 pieces of silver. We were sold out for $70 a share.''
 August A. Busch IV, the scion who runs the family brewery that makes Budweiser and Michelob and dates to before the Civil War, had vowed that there would be no sale on his watch. But in the end, sentiment and tradition were no match for a $52 billion offer from the Belgian beer giant InBev. 
 All around this old Midwestern city famous for its brew, heads have been shaking in disbelief. Budweiser, the king of American beers, will belong to Europe.
 ''It took everybody by surprise,'' said Mr. Liszewski, a member of the Teamsters union who followed his uncle into the brewery 30 years ago. ''They promised us this wouldn't happen.''
 An American flag snaps high above the belching stacks of the brewery, a red-brick and wrought-iron fortress in the historic Soulard neighborhood, where the air is tinged with the smell of yeast.
 The Anheuser-Busch dynasty is so ingrained in the identity of St. Louis that people here talk about the Busch family as if they are both royalty and relatives, making references to ''Gussie'' (August A. Busch Jr.) and ''Augie'' (August A. Busch III).
 In a city that does not do much bragging, the mighty brewery has long been a reason to boast.
 ''St. Louis has a terrible inferiority complex,'' said Susan Manlin Katman, sitting in the shade at an outdoor cafe in the trendy Central West End neighborhood. ''We're not North or South, East or West. So we tend to dwell on what we're lacking, instead of what we have.''
 Downtown St. Louis has witnessed a striking resurgence in recent years, with the opening of stylish pubs and restaurants and the refurbishing of residential lofts. With its French and German influences, St. Louis has a rich cultural history and an architectural flourish. It has exulted in the glories of Cardinal baseball heroes, from Stan Musial to Albert Pujols. The city also claims Forest Park, an urban nature preserve near downtown that is bigger than Central Park.
 But for all that, its national acclaim is tied mostly to the brewery -- it brings the tourists to town, along with the Gateway Arch. Almost anywhere in the world that residents of St. Louis travel, they are asked about the King of Beers and, of course, the Clydesdales, the mascots of the brewery. 
 InBev has pledged not to shut down any of Anheuser-Busch's 12 breweries in the United States. But many here still feel here as if a treasure is endangered. 
 As Opal Henderson, a 78-year-old auto salvage yard owner, put it, ''Why can't those foreigners just stay at home and leave us what we have?'' 
 Mayor Francis G. Slay has a different view. ''One of my first goals,'' he said in a statement, ''will be to try to convince InBev, which loves to cut costs, to move to St. Louis, where pretty much everything is cheaper than in Belgium.''
 That is not likely to happen. Among the 6,000 St. Louis-area workers employed at A-B, as it is known here, the worry is that the new owner will try to cut jobs or wages. 
 Mr. Liszewski, who operates a machine that puts labels on bottles of Bud Light, earns $27 an hour. He is a blue-collar man in work boots who has been able to pay off his house and buy land in Southern Illinois where he can hunt for deer. ''It's not just been a good life,'' he said. ''It's been an excellent life.''
 At the St. Louis Galleria, Alexis Littlejohn, a bank worker, said she believed that the new owners think they have a way to squeeze more profits out of the brewery. ''If it didn't make economic sense,'' she said, ''they wouldn't be doing it.''
 In the bars around the brewery district, there is a mixture of anger and fear, even among those who do not work for Anheuser-Busch.
 Loyalty runs deep for the brewery and its workers. If you order a beer at Crabby's saloon, it had better be an Anheuser-Busch product. They do not carry anything else. 
 The owner, Stephanie Hafertebe, certainly does not stock any Stella Artois, a beer made by InBev.
 ''Not so many years ago, union workers would walk out of a place if you served anything that wasn't Anheuser-Busch,'' Ms. Hafertebe said.
 A couple of patrons were shooting pool. A cocker spaniel was crawling around the floor. On the jukebox, Frank Sinatra crooned, ''I get no kick from Champagne.''
 Tom Lucas, a 51-year-old auto mechanic with oil-stained fingers, sat on a barstool and drew hard on a cigarette.
 St. Louis is a place where people can still smoke in taverns. But everything else seems to be changing. The idea of the brewery belonging to foreigners seemed unfathomable to many. People like Mr. Lucas may have to get used to it. But he does not have to like it.
 ''It stinks,'' Mr. Lucas said. ''Augie would be rolling in his grave if he knew about this.''

HEADLINE: Bernanke Is Pessimistic, but Bush Urges a 'Deep Breath'

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; David Stout contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Warning of the risks of a further slowdown and higher inflation, Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, offered a gloomy assessment of the economy on Tuesday as President Bush, speaking a few blocks away, urged Americans to have faith in the country's financial foundation.
 In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Bernanke avoided the word ''recession'' in characterizing the current economy, noting instead that consumer spending and exports were keeping growth ''at a sluggish pace'' while the housing sector ''continues to weaken.'' 
 He added that spending for personal goods had ''advanced at a modest pace so far this year, generally holding up somewhat better than might have been expected given the array of forces weighing on household finances and attitudes.''
 While the risks to the overall economy were still ''skewed to the downside,'' he said, inflation ''seems likely to move temporarily higher in the near term.'' 
 Even as Mr. Bernanke fielded questions from senators, a different view of the economy emanated from the White House.
 President Bush, speaking at a White House news conference that coincided with the Fed chair's testimony, urged Americans to ''take a deep breath.'' 
 ''My hope is -- is that people take a deep breath and realize that their deposits are protected by our government,'' the president said. He added that economic growth ''was not the growth we'd like'' but expressed confidence that the country would overcome ''a time of uncertainty.'' The nation's troubled financial system is ''basically sound,'' he added. 
 The president said that the economy and the pillars on which it rests were ''basically sound.'' And he dismissed questions about reports that wholesale prices rose 1.8 percent in June, the fastest 12-month inflation rate in more than a quarter century.
 Mr. Bernanke's mixed assessment of the economy appeared to signal that the Fed would not be lowering interest rates further in spite of the economic sluggishness, as it did earlier this year, out of concern that lower rates would spur more inflation. In June, the Fed declined to lower rates and instead suggested it might raise rates later in the year.
 In his testimony, he was especially pessimistic about any easing of energy prices, dismissing suggestions that they were being driven by speculation in futures markets. Instead, he said high energy costs reflected the markets' recognition that demand was outstripping supplies.
 ''Over the past several years, the world economy has expanded at its fastest pace in decades, leading to substantial increases in the demand for oil,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''On the supply side, despite sharp increases in prices, the production of oil has risen only slightly in the past few years.''
 President Bush's remarks, and Mr. Bernanke's testimony, came at an unusually turbulent time in financial markets, since it followed on the heels of the Fed's announcement that it would temporarily open its discount window to the two troubled mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 The actions to stabilize Fannie and Freddie occurred over the weekend as the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., also called for Congress to approve emergency legislation giving the federal government power to inject billions of federal funds through investments and loans.
 The actions announced Sunday echoed similar actions in mid-March, when the Fed moved to avert a financial collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns by offering an emergency loan to facilitate its sale to JPMorgan Chase. At the same time, the Fed set up emergency lending facilities for major investment banks hit by the credit crunch.
 ''These steps to address liquidity pressures coupled with monetary easing seem to have been helpful in mitigating some market strains,'' Mr. Bernanke said. But despite the ''positive effects'' of the Fed's actions, he said that the problems of unstable markets continued because of ''declining house prices, a softening labor market and rising prices of oil, food and some other commodities.''
 After Mr. Bernanke's testimony, Mr. Paulson and the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Christopher Cox, took center stage. 
 In prepared remarks, Mr. Paulson focused on the government's efforts to assist Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, complementing comments earlier by Mr. Bush, who urged Congress to pass housing legislation that would modernize federal regulatory procedures while stabilizing the two companies. 
 Continued confidence in the two companies ''is important to maintaining financial system and market stability,'' Mr. Paulson said. While lawmakers have said that they would attach the bailout plan to housing legislation, the timing was uncertain. 
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Monday that a bill could be sent to President Bush by week's end. But on Tuesday, Congressional Democrats said it would take at least until early next week for the House to act, citing resistance among some Republicans to the administration's rescue plan for Fannie and Freddie.
 In his testimony Tuesday, Mr. Paulson said Fannie and Freddie ''are central to the availability of housing finance, which will determine the pace at which we emerge from this housing correction.''
 ''Our plan is aimed at supporting the stability of financial markets,'' he said, ''not just these two enterprises. This is consistent with Treasury's mission to promote the market stability, orderliness and liquidity necessary to support our economy.''

HEADLINE: Bush Emphasizes His Opposition to Timetable for Iraq Withdrawal

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush said Tuesday that Iraq wanted to include an ''aspirational goal'' for the departure of most foreign troops there in any agreement authorizing future American operations, but he reiterated his opposition to what he called ''an artificial timetable for withdrawal.''
 His remarks reflected the growing doubt within the administration that the United States could negotiate the sweeping long-term agreement that would clear the way for American troops to operate in Iraq for many years to come. Mr. Bush and Iraq's prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, had pledged to reach such an agreement last year. 
 Mr. Bush instead referred to a seemingly more modest ''understanding'' with Iraq on the legal status of American and other foreign troops once the current United Nations mandate expires at the end of the year. 
 ''The Iraqis have, you know, have invited us to be there,'' Mr. Bush said at a White House news conference. ''But they share a goal with us, which is to get our combat troops out as conditions permit. Matter of fact, that's what we're doing.''
 An administration official said later in the day that an agreement that would cover American operations -- from combat missions to detaining Iraqis -- could still be reached by the end of this month, but only by leaving specific legal details governing military forces, known as a Status of Forces Agreement, to future talks.
 Although the 52-minute news conference was dominated by economic concerns, Mr. Bush faced a series of questions on foreign policy concerns, including Iraq and the unruly border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
 He also addressed the uncertainty over the status of terrorist suspects held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after the Supreme Court ruled that prisoners there could challenge their detention.
 Mr. Bush also sought to rebut criticism from Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, who on Tuesday accused the administration of having a ''single-minded and open-ended focus'' on Iraq. 
 Mr. Bush disputed that the war in Iraq had distracted the administration from the resurgence of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. At the same time, he acknowledged the worsening violence in Afghanistan, which he called ''a tough fight'' against a ''tough enemy.''
 ''You know, I understand exhaustion; I understand people are getting tired,'' he said, turning the question about Mr. Obama's criticism into a broad defense of his conduct of the war against Al Qaeda and other terrorists. 
 ''But I would hope that whoever follows me understands that we're at war,'' Mr. Bush said, ''and now's not the time to give up in the struggle against this enemy.''
 There has been resistance in both countries to the Bush administration's efforts to negotiate an agreement with Iraq that would outline broad diplomatic and economic relations between the countries, while also providing a legal basis for continuing to conduct military operations. 
 Mr. Maliki, facing opposition from Iraqi political parties wary of American intentions, told Arab leaders last week that he was prepared to negotiate only a shorter-term agreement. He said he would insist on a timetable for withdrawal.
 Mr. Bush has repeatedly said that he will respect the wishes of the Iraqis. That has made it difficult for the president to dismiss Mr. Maliki's appeals, even if, as many administration official argue, Iraq is unlikely to demand a precipitous withdrawal of American troops that could risk the security gains achieved in recent months.
 Mr. Bush acknowledged Iraq's desire to reduce American forces to the point where they would mainly provide training and logistical support for Iraq's armed forces, while carrying out limited counterterrorism operations. The American military commander in Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus, has defined this role as ''overwatch.''
 But neither General Petraeus nor administration officials have indicated an approximate date for that to happen. Nor have officials indicated publicly what dates, if any, would be written into any agreement. 
 The administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said any agreement needed to signal to the Iraqis that ''they're getting their country back.'' But the official emphasized that it was still possible to reach an agreement that would cover American forces, if not in the shape initially envisioned. 
 On Afghanistan, Mr. Bush said the United States was prepared to investigate President Hamid Karzai's accusation that Pakistan's intelligence services were behind terrorist attacks inside Afghanistan.
 Mr. Bush also warned that the flow of militants based in Pakistan's tribal areas into Afghanistan could pose a threat to Pakistan's government as well, because they could return home ''with a skill level that could be used against the government.''
 ''And that's troubling to us, it's troubling to Afghanistan, and it should be troubling to Pakistan,'' he said. ''We share a common enemy. That would be extremists who either disrupt democracy or prevent democracy from taking hold.''

HEADLINE: Brakes and Other Headaches at an Aircraft Show

BYLINE: By CAROLINE BROTHERS; Micheline Maynard contributed reporting.

DATELINE: FARNBOROUGH, England 

 BODY:
Problems linked to the braking system of Boeing's delayed 787 Dreamliner and a lack of orders from Western airlines darkened the mood Tuesday at the Farnborough International Airshow, the aerospace industry's showcase annual event. 
 Patrick Shanahan, the managing director for the 787 program, said that the problem in the software for the braking system would not delay production, but that it was using up the cushion the company had allowed for holdups. 
 ''It's not a functionality issue, it's a certification issue,'' Mr. Shanahan said, adding that the supplier, General Electric, was handling the problem. ''They have to rewrite the software for verification,'' he said. 
 The Dreamliner is expected to make its initial flight in the fourth quarter and be delivered to customers next year.
 Meanwhile, Louis Gallois, the chief executive of European Aeronautic Defense and Space, parent of Airbus, said during an interview that as of June 30, Airbus had received cancellations for 38 planes, including a dozen A318s and three A340s. The remaining 23 planes were A350s, which were counted as cancellations although the customers had upgraded the orders to the wide-body version of the plane. 
 Mr. Gallois said Airbus could find other buyers for the aircraft. 
 ''We have a high backlog with overbooking, and it is not difficult to find people to take them up,'' Mr. Gallois said. 
 While the chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Scott E. Carson, said that his company had not received any cancellations, some airlines, particularly in the United States, were deferring orders. 
 ''Delays are a reflection of a sudden change of strategy,'' said Howard Wheeldon, an analyst at the brokerage firm BGC Partners in London. ''If they are canceling, it is a reflection of the ability to pay and the lack of ability to grow as a result of the volume downturn you envisage.'' 
 Aircraft manufacturers have boasted about their big order backlogs, estimated at seven years for Airbus and five years for Boeing. But the situation could change swiftly if airlines begin pulling back, said Philip Toy, managing director with AlixPartners, a reorganization firm based in Southfield, Mich., that specializes in aerospace. 
 Airlines are suffering as high oil prices and an economic downturn hurt their cost and revenue bases. Experts estimate that as much as 33 percent to 40 percent of the order backlogs could vanish during the next 18 months.
 Those worries and few orders except those coming mainly from Middle Eastern airlines and from leasing companies left attendees at the show, south of London, in a sober mood. 
 The biggest order of the day was from DAE Capital, the aircraft leasing and financing division of Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, for 100 planes: 30 midrange Airbus A350-900s and 70 single-aisle A320s, worth $13 billion at list prices. 
 Another leasing company, Aviation Capital Group, a unit of the Pacific Life Corporation, ordered 23 A320 planes with a combined list price of $1.7 billion, while the Russian leasing company Avia ordered 24 regional Superjets, to be built by Sukhoi and Alenia, with a list price of $630 million. 
 Orders continued from the Middle East. Tunisair ordered 16 Airbus jets, including 10 A320s, listed at $1.94 billion, while Qatar ordered four Airbus A321s and placed options on two more. 
 The only orders from older, so-called legacy airlines came from Arik of Nigeria and Aeroflot of Russia. Aeroflot placed an order for five A321 Airbus planes with a list price of $450 million. Arik chose seven Boeing 737s. Some orders had been announced in advance of the air show. 
 ''This is about as good as it gets,'' Mr. Wheeldon said. ''I don't see Boeing or Airbus enjoying order announcements of anything like the scale we've seen this month in the months or even years ahead.'' 
 He was wary of pinning too much hope on China and the Middle East, saying they too would be subject to a decline in passengers on the international routes where they are picking up traffic from other airlines.
 ''They cannot escape the global economic crisis in the way some imagine,'' he said.

HEADLINE: VW Picks Tennessee as Site for a Car Plant

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. 

 BODY:
Volkswagen, the German automaker, picked Chattanooga over rival sites in two other states for a new assembly plant expected to create about 2,000 jobs.
 Volkswagen Group of America said it would produce a new midsize sedan made specifically for the North American consumer and invest $1 billion in the economy. 
 Sites in Alabama and Michigan were also considered for the plant, which is part of Volkswagen's strategy to increase its presence in America. Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker, closed its last American plant in 1988.
 Christian Wulff, the governor of the German state of Lower Saxony and a member of VW's supervisory board, told The Associated Press that the company had picked Chattanooga after the board debated the merits of the location and its benefits.
 The company statement said the plant near the Georgia and Alabama borders would create 2,000 direct jobs and ''add a significant number of jobs in related sectors.''
 A statement from the corporate parent said Volkswagen had approved up to $991.4 million to build the plant, with an intended capacity of 150,000 cars a year. It plans to start production in 2011.
 Tennessee officials have not released details of what it is giving Volkswagen, but the company's statement said the ''incentives are tied to job creation and capital investment. Additional support includes assistance for public infrastructure and job training.''
 VW picked Tennessee 25 years after the Nissan Motor Company became the first foreign automaker in the South, at Smyrna, Tenn.
 The 1,350-acre site at Enterprise South Industrial Park near Interstates 75 and 24 between Nashville and Atlanta has long been seeking an auto assembly plant.
 Chattanooga previously lost out on the $1.3 billion Toyota plant that is being built near Tupelo, Miss., and the $1.2 billion Kia Motors plant that went to West Point, Ga.
 Volkswagen holds only a 2 percent share of the American market. VW officials have said the company intends to more than triple its American sales to one million by 2018.
 Lower Saxony owns more than 20 percent of Volkswagen.
 Mr. Wulff said the new plant, in addition to factories in India and Russia, is part of the Volkswagen's strategy to expand.
 While competing against Alabama and Michigan, Tennessee officials in recent weeks approved $1.25 million for work at the Chattanooga site that was once part of a United States Army ammunition plant complex. 
 The South offers ample highway and rail connections and hundreds of existing suppliers but its main attraction is a labor pool that is willing to work without being members of the United Automobile Workers union.
 Industry executives and analysts have said there is plenty of room for more automakers in the region, as long as the plants are at least 40 or 50 miles apart to avoid competing for skilled workers.
 Volkswagen's only other North American plant is in Puebla, Mexico.

HEADLINE: Debating Rebates and Bailouts A Second Round of Stimulus Checks? Democrats in Congress See a Need

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
Many economists have concluded that a second dose of government stimulus spending is required to prevent a broad economic unraveling and provide relief to millions of Americans grappling with joblessness, plunging home prices and tight credit.
 Democratic leaders in Congress have already begun fashioning a package of proposed measures, but on Tuesday, President Bush and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, both pronounced such action premature.
 ''Our economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience,'' President Bush said at a morning news conference, even as he acknowledged that growth had been ''slower than we would have liked.'' 
 Mr. Bush emphasized that the package of stimulus measures adopted in February -- $100 billion in income tax rebates to households this year, and $52 billion in tax cuts for businesses -- has not been fully distributed. 
 ''We ought to see how the first one works,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Let it run its course. I'm an optimist.''
 Debate about a second package of stimulus measures has percolated in Washington for weeks as unemployment has climbed and housing prices have fallen. But the prospect of another surge of government largess has taken on urgency in recent days amid worry about the health of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which own or guarantee roughly half of the nation's $12 trillion in mortgages.
 On Tuesday, Nancy Pelosi of California, the speaker of the House, and other House Democrats met with economists to draft another stimulus package, saying it was likely to include spending for roads, bridges, schools and other public facilities, as well as aid for states confronting smaller tax revenues in the face of the housing downturn. 
 ''This is a serious situation,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration who attended the meeting, according to Bloomberg News. ''We are in much more danger of responding inefficiently than in responding excessively.'' 
 In an interview last week, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said it would be ''really hard'' to get a package put together before the August recess, indicating that the issue was unlikely to gain momentum before the fall.
 The White House and Congressional Republicans maintain that the best way to reinvigorate the economy is to adopt legislation to limit home foreclosures and expand domestic production of oil. 
 ''Those will do more than any $300 you might send out to the taxpayers,'' said Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia.
 Even as Mr. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said it was too early to discuss another round of stimulus, he lent credence to the gathering sense that the economy appears to be deteriorating more deeply than policy makers had feared, as he testified before the Senate banking committee. Rising prices for food and gasoline have exacerbated tight credit and falling home prices to crimp household spending, he said.
 Though the Fed has lowered interest rates aggressively in a bid to spur the economy, Mr. Bernanke said growth would remain ''appreciably below its trend rate'' for the rest of the year. 
 ''The economy continues to face numerous difficulties,'' he said.
 New evidence of trouble emerged Tuesday when the government released data showing that retail sales grew by a scant 0.1 percent in June over the previous month -- only one-fourth the increase economists had expected -- in a potential sign that the effect of the rebate checks is already wearing off.
 The Labor Department reported that prices paid by producers climbed 1.8 percent in June, and 9.2 percent over the last year -- the biggest 12-month jump in more than a quarter-century. 
 ''If we don't have another stimulus package, that means serious hardship for a lot of people,'' said Graciela Chichilnisky, an economist at Columbia University. ''All the large industries will shrink operations and lay people off. A lot of people will lose jobs. This is not a typical downturn.''
 But as Congress debates whether to send another rush of public money surging through the economy, the politics appear nettlesome -- particularly in the thick of a presidential election campaign that may well be decided on economic ground. 
 Even if consensus eventually settles behind another round of stimulus, what specific measures it should include could be especially difficult to resolve. How to generate the swiftest bang for the buck is a subject of fierce debate among economists. In Washington, the subject trips deep partisan divisions -- a fact that President Bush underscored at his news conference. 
 ''If the Democratic leaders had their way in Congress, they would raise taxes, which would be the absolute wrong thing to do,'' Mr. Bush said.
 Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, last month proposed a $50 billion package of stimulus measures -- $30 billion in fresh tax rebates, $10 billion in aid to states, and $10 billion to help families stave off the loss of homes to foreclosure. 
 The state money could be used to finance infrastructure projects to generate jobs, said Mr. Obama's economic policy adviser, Jason Furman. 
 ''We have a major collapse in the labor market, especially for men without high school degrees, a lot of whom have historically been employed in construction,'' Mr. Furman said. 
 Senator Obama has called on his Republican rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, to join in support. Mr. McCain has declined to embrace the package, though a campaign spokesman said he still may. But Mr. McCain's chief domestic policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, last week disparaged the largest piece of Mr. Obama's proposal -- more tax rebates.
 ''The problems facing this economy are pretty easy to identify,'' Mr. Holtz-Eakin said in an interview. ''Energy prices are high and rising. Writing checks doesn't do anything to solve that problem.''
 Mr. McCain has called for a temporary rollback of gasoline taxes, an idea spurned by Mr. Obama and many economists as encouraging consumers to buy more gas, sending prices higher. 
 Mr. McCain's economic adviser also rejected another idea that has become a centerpiece of Mr. Obama's stimulus thinking -- financing large infrastructure projects.
 ''That's not timely and quick,'' Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. He offered as a better course lowering corporate taxes and making President Bush's larger tax cuts permanent.
 Indeed, the policy prescriptions of Mr. McCain's chief economic adviser were challenged by another economist on the McCain campaign, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com.
 A paper Mr. Zandi prepared this year concluded that, within the first year of enactment, increased infrastructure spending and aid to states generate roughly four times as much economic growth as making the president's tax cuts permanent, cutting corporate taxes or allowing businesses to write off new investments more quickly.
 ''Everyone agrees that we need jobs, and everyone also agrees that infrastructure is one of our most pressing needs,'' Mr. Zandi said in an interview last week. ''If we can combine stimulus with infrastructure, I think that's great.''
 Above all, Mr. Zandi said, it was now imperative the government deliver some sort of new stimulus.
 ''The problems plaguing the economy seem entrenched,'' he said. ''The economy could spiral even further down if you don't try to stemthat.''
 The Treasury Department has already distributed nearly $92 billion of the promised $100 billion in tax rebates. This surge of cash has landed in cash registers, sparing some jobs, say economists. But it has neither enticed companies to hire, nor persuaded banks to lend to any significant degree. As the effects wear off -- perhaps sooner than later -- most experts expect the economy will pull back and remain weak into next year.
 If they do assent to another stimulus package, Republicans are inclined to push for more tax cuts for businesses, an approach that draws skepticism from some economists.
 ''When businesses can't sell what they're selling now, they don't have much of an incentive to invest in new plants,'' said Chad Stone, chief economist for the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, a liberal policy institute.
 Others say the measures being discussed are mere tinkering in the face of a crisis that can be solved only by injecting banks with substantial money. Until their balance sheets are restored, bankers will continue to be tight with their dollars, starving the economy of investment, said Vincent R. Reinhart, formerly an economist at the Federal Reserve and now a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The government must hand some $300 billion to major banks, he argues, recovering the money as their business improves.
 ''It's really unpalatable, but it's the bucket with the least holes,'' Mr. Reinhart said. ''All this other stuff is addressing the manifestations of the problem, rather than the problem itself.''

HEADLINE: Ah, the Heat, the Crowd, The Park, and the Booze

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
The phenomenon can be a little startling to newcomers, though it is one that more seasoned New Yorkers most likely no longer see, possibly because they are still recovering from the night before.
Michael Treanor, who is 23 and from Santa Cruz, Calif., finds himself caught up in it every time he visits.
''Without having to drive, I drink here all the time,'' said Mr. Treanor.
''We found a cafe that served unlimited mimosas with breakfast,'' said his fiancee, Brianna Jacobson, 23. ''And we do not have that back home,'' Mr. Treanor said. 
With bars on every corner, and -- thanks to buses, subways or cabs -- no need to drive after the drinking is done, New York City, for Mr. Treanor, is like a giant -- and boozy -- college campus. And this is never more true than in the summer.
Even going to the movies involves drinking. Mr. Treanor and Ms. Jacobson were sitting with their friend Christopher Jarrod Thomas, also 23, in the middle of Bryant Park. It was a recent Monday evening, and a free film, ''The Man Who Came to Dinner,'' was about to be shown.
They were polishing off two bottles of Yellow Tail shiraz, without cups. And, to their surprise, no one was stopping them.
''I'm a little shocked,'' said Mr. Treanor between swigs, his eyes widening. ''In California, this is way not allowed.''
New York City is somewhat of a drinker's paradise year round, but a certain extra layer of permissiveness seems to infuse the city in the summertime, along with a wellspring of opportunities to get sloshed, slightly or mightily.
Be they surreptitiously sipped from brown paper bags or openly downed from plastic tumblers at movie nights or concerts in an array of parks, drinks of all stripes and potencies surface in force, rather brazenly. And thus the hazy morning of the next summer day is often contemplated through the secondary haze of a hangover.
''Drinks are cold, New York's hot, the weather's warm and the days are long,'' said Lucy Paynter, 25, a bartender and singer who was taking in a movie, and some pinot grigio, while stretched out on Bryant Park's lawn. ''It's a thing in the summer. I think people are generally more irresponsible. That's why you have summer flings. And that's why you drink. It's a hedonistic season.''
Viewers arrive early on Bryant Park's movie nights to claim their turf with blankets. Then they pull out thermal bags stuffed with ice and beers, wine, wine coolers and even, in the case of the truly well prepared, liquor and cocktail mix.
Arthur Golden served up his signature frozen strawberry daiquiris in the center of the lawn, where 20-odd blankets were spread out for his friends.
''I always bring 12 bags of frozen mix, because that's the capacity of my freezer,'' said Mr. Golden, who is 41 and works in real estate development.
There was an array of rums to choose from, too: light, dark and coconut. Mr. Golden mixed the daiquiris using a potato masher, churning the strawberry slush with rum in a plastic container, and offered the end product to all takers.
Mr. Golden and his friends have been going to movie nights in Bryant Park since he was in his late 20s and have the sequencing of the night's cocktails down to a science.
''Elisha brings sangria, Ian brings margaritas and David brings prosecco,'' he said.
That night, however, ''sangria Elisha'' -- Elisha Osherowitz, 30, an office manager who lives in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and who befriended Mr. Golden's crew at Bryant Park a few years back -- had not made it home in time to make sangria. No matter, lots of wine was on hand.
''The movies are great, but we're here for the socializing beforehand,'' said Ms. Osherowitz.
''Actually,'' said another friend, Amy Weidner, 30, a teacher from Jackson Heights, Queens, ''a lot of people leave when the movie starts.''
The Bryant Park scene is replicated to an extent around the sweating city, be it at the Great Lawn in Central Park, Cunningham Park in Queens, or Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. Whenever there are free events, the throngs follow, alcohol stealthily -- or not so stealthily -- in tow.
(The official line from the city's parks department is that alcohol cannot be brought into city parks, though in the summer of 2003, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg suggested that drinking wine at concerts in Central Park was O.K. At Bryant Park on July 7, a security guard said he turned a blind eye to booze on movie nights, ''so long as it is covered, like in a bag.'')
At Prospect Park in Brooklyn a few Fridays ago, where crowds listened to the band Cold War Kids, much of the party took place, as usual, on the lawn across from the bandshell, where it is easier to B.Y.O.B. A woman named Carrie, 24, who did not want to give her last name because she is a teacher and feared backlash from students' parents, was drinking beer out of paper bags with her friends. She said the city felt like a giant college campus in the summer because there were ''so many B.Y.O.B. events.''
Various New Yorkers roundly agreed that theirs was a ''drinking city,'' where people work and play hard, and often live like Peter Pan, putting off the trappings of adulthood, like marriage and children, for as long as possible. But there were disagreements over finer points, like whether people drank more in the summer, or just more openly.
Mr. Golden, the daiquiri man of Bryant Park, said he switched to different drinks in the summer but that the quantity did not change from the wintertime. Ms. Osherowitz said she paced herself year round. But Ms. Paynter said that in the summer, business picked up markedly at Dive 75 on the Upper West Side, where she bartends. ''I do twice the revenue of what I do in the winter,'' she said. ''I drink more; everybody does.''
(There does not seem to be an official tally of how, or if, alcohol consumption in the city varies by season. According to the Metropolitan Package Store Association, which represents the region's liquor retailers, consumption stays mostly consistent year round. And a spokesman for the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, said sales at indoors bars tended to dip in the summer, because people were buying alcohol elsewhere, for barbeques and other outdoor events).
Also divided on the matter were Elizabeth Brady, 24, and her friends, who arrived many hours before sunset one night last week at McCarren Park Pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, where The L Magazine, a local events guide, was throwing a ''Williamsburg block party.''
Ms. Brady -- ''Boozeabeth'' to her friends -- said her alcohol consumption soared during the hot months. ''In the winter, on a weekend, it's like, 'Oh, it's 2 p.m., let's go to a movie,' '' said Ms. Brady, who was on her third beer, purchased from an onsite vendor, and works in ad sales at The L Magazine. She wears a ring emblazoned with the word ''Boozey'' on it. ''In the summer, we head to a patio.''
Her friends were not so sure.
''In general in the winter, everyone's depressed and drinking,'' said Jennifer Fein, 26, a painter who lives in Jersey City. ''They're just drinking sadder.''
''If it was winter, you wouldn't be drinking now,'' said Mark Iantosca, 24, who currently is not working.
''You would be if you were unemployed,'' said Ms. Fein, at which point Mr. Iantosca glumly nodded his assent.
Yet, as their friend Britt Aronovich, 24, who also works at The L Magazine, said, people get drunker faster in the summer, because it is so hot. Indeed there are perils to over imbibing in the heat, like getting dehydrated or sick. Wouldn't it follow, then, that summertime hangovers are that much worse?
Ms. Brady shrugged.
''I think it's normal for people our age, out of college, to learn how to function with a hangover,'' Ms. Brady said. ''It's like when people have a baby, and they say they haven't slept in weeks. C'est la vie.''

HEADLINE: Archie McCardell, Harvester Chief Who Clashed With Union, Dies at 81

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Archie R. McCardell, whose gruff, bottom-line approach as the new chief of the International Harvester Company in the late 1970s drew praise from Wall Street but the enmity of labor, culminating in a bitter five-and-a-half-month strike, died Friday in Casper, Wyo., where he lived. He was 81.
The cause was complications of heart failure, said his grandson, Scott Arcenas. 
Mr. McCardell knew success early, as senior class president in high school and the first in his family to attend college. After earning an M.B.A., he rose to director of finance for the Ford Motor Company in Germany, then moved to Xerox, where he was promoted to president.
He joined Harvester, based in Chicago, in August 1977 as president and chief operating officer, explaining that he thought he would have a better chance of being the top executive there than at Xerox. He became chief executive the following January and chairman in June 1979.
Upon his arrival Mr. McCardell began an aggressive program to cut costs and engineered a profit increase in his first year, to $370 million from $203.7 million.
But Harvester's margins were only a little more than half those of its competitors Caterpillar Inc. and Deere & Company. This had resulted in part from past concessions to labor and a tradition of paying out most earnings as dividends rather than reinvesting them.
When the United Auto Workers contract expired on Nov. 1, 1979, Mr. McCardell saw an opportunity to improve efficiency by persuading the union to give up rights it had won in past negotiations, particularly on overtime.
The union went on strike for nearly six months and eventually retained most of the work rights Mr. McCardell had sought to take away. Harvester had lost $479.4 million during the strike and $397.3 million in its 1980 fiscal year.
Union members complained that Mr. McCardell and his lieutenants only heightened tensions by acting arrogant and aloof during the strike, in one instance, they said, sending armed guards to watch dismissed workers clean out their lockers, The New York Times reported in 1982.
Another flash point was Mr. McCardell's compensation package, which included a $1.5 million signing bonus and a $450,000 annual salary -- astronomical figures for executive compensation then but modest ones by today's standards. Workers as well as shareholders were also furious when the company forgave a $1.8 million loan to Mr. McCardell.
The labor problems only added to the company's woes. Climbing interest rates, weak markets and high-cost plants had helped push Harvester's debt to $4.5 billion. Only through an agreement with 200 lenders in 1981 did Harvester escape bankruptcy.
Mr. McCardell resigned in May 1982, although Time magazine and other publications suggested that his departure was really a firing. ''The real wonder was that McCardell had not been ousted much earlier,'' Time said.
International Harvester did not recover, and in 1985 it sold its farm equipment division, which had started with Cyrus McCormick's reaper factory. Its crimson tractors and combines had long been a familiar feature of the American heartland. The remainder of the company, its truck and engines division, became the Navistar International Corporation in 1986.
Archie Richard McCardell was born in Hazel Park, Mich., on Aug. 29, 1926. He served in the Army Air Forces, then used the G.I. Bill to earn undergraduate and M.B.A. degrees from the University of Michigan. He joined Ford as a financial analyst. In 1960, he was appointed secretary-treasurer of Ford of Australia, and three years later became director of finance for Ford of Germany.
In 1966, he joined Xerox as group vice president for corporate services, rising to president in 1971. At Xerox, he helped set up a program for employees to get paid leave in order to serve their communities.
His ability to cut costs and shepherd technological innovation attracted the attention of Booz Allen Hamilton, which was helping revamp Harvester. Booz Allen recruited him for the Harvester job.
Mr. McCardell later worked in real estate development, scuba-diving expeditions and other business ventures.
He is survived by his wife, the former Margaret Edith Martin; three children, Sandra, Laurie and Clay, all of whom have the last name McCardell and all of whom live in Casper; two brothers, Allan, of Milford, Mich., and Arnold, of Perry, Mich.; one sister, JoAnne Iwanicki, of Warren, Mich.; and four grandchildren in addition to Mr. Arcenas.
Six months after Mr. McCardell left Harvester, he spoke to a group at Harvard Business School. He said he had two regrets: the controversial nature of his compensation deal, and not getting to know union people better before the strike.
Asked to grade himself, Mr. McCardell nonetheless replied, ''I think I rate myself superb.''

HEADLINE: A 1913 Law Dies To Better Serve Gay Marriages

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK and KATIE ZEZIMA

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Massachusetts may have been the first state to legalize same-sex marriage for its residents, but when California last month invited out-of-state gay and lesbian couples to get married, the potential economic benefits did not go unnoticed here. Now Massachusetts wants to extend the same invitation.
On Tuesday, the State Senate voted to repeal a 1913 law that prevents Massachusetts from marrying out-of-state couples if their marriages would not be legal in their home states. The repeal, which passed with no objections on a voice vote, is expected to pass the House later this week. Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat and a supporter of same-sex marriage whose 18-year-old daughter recently disclosed publicly that she is a lesbian, has said he will sign the repeal. 
The repeal of the out-of-state marriage ban would come more than four years after Massachusetts became the first state to allow gay men and lesbians to marry, and same-sex marriage advocates said the timing was carefully calculated to catch the prevailing political -- and economic -- winds.
State officials said they expected a multimillion-dollar benefit in weddings and tourism, especially from people who live in New York. A just-released study commissioned by the State of Massachusetts concludes that in the next three years about 32,200 couples would travel here to get married, creating 330 permanent jobs and adding $111 million to the economy, not including spending by wedding guests and tourist activities the weddings might generate.
''We now have this added pressure, given what's happened in California, that we really think that it is a good thing that we be prepared to receive the economic benefit,'' State Senator Dianne Wilkerson, a Democrat who sponsored the repeal bill, said Tuesday after the vote.
Ms. Wilkerson added, ''For me it wasn't the most important basis of the argument, but it certainly is a perk.''
Legislators and same-sex marriage advocates said their primary motivation for the repeal was to allow all same-sex couples an opportunity to marry and to revoke a law that many saw as discriminatory. The law, believed to have been designed to uphold other states' bans on interracial marriage, was invoked in 2004 by Gov. Mitt Romney, a same-sex marriage opponent who said he did not want to make Massachusetts ''the Las Vegas of same-sex marriage.''
Kofi Jones, spokeswoman for Secretary Dan O'Connell of Housing and Economic Development, said: ''The administration believes repealing this discriminatory and antiquated law is simply the right thing to do. The study does show, though, that this action could also bring some added economic benefits to the commonwealth, which would be welcomed.''
Ted Jarrett, owner of the Old Mill on the Falls Bed and Breakfast in Hatfield, Mass., which plays host to many same-sex weddings, said: ''Obviously it would help us from a business standpoint. I kind of feel like there will be people coming in.''
Politically, the California decision and a decision by Gov. David A. Paterson of New York to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states, gave supporters of same-sex marriage here the fuel they needed to press for repeal without fear that it would become a lightning rod in the presidential election, advocates said.
''We were collectively thinking about planning to wait until after the November elections because we were concerned that the far right, the Karl Rove types of people, would once again try to use this issue as a wedge issue in the campaign,'' said Marc Solomon, campaign director for MassEquality. ''Once the California decision happened and out-of-state couples could go to California, there was no reason not to move forthwith.''
Arline Isaacson, co-chairwoman of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus, said that many lawmakers felt the California ruling made support for lifting the ban far less controversial, and that the economic argument did not hurt.
''Like other states, it's tough fiscal times,'' Ms. Isaacson said, ''and everyone recognizes that this will be an economic boon for Massachusetts because every gay person who comes here to marry, most won't come alone.''
She continued, ''They will bring their families and their friends and all those people will stay at the hotels, eat at the restaurants, shop at the stores and hire caterers and florists and musicians.''
The study predicts that most of the couples -- about 21,000 -- will come from New York, nearly half of the 48,761 same-sex couples in that state.
Alan Van Capelle, the executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay rights group in New York, said that he could not speculate on the numbers and that ''there are a certain percentage of people like myself'' who will ''wait till New York issues marriage licenses.''
But, he predicted ''a lot of Jet Blue cancellations from LaGuardia to Laguna and some Amtrak purchases from New York to Boston,'' adding, ''Tanglewood, the Red Lion Inn, how do you say no?''
Mr. Van Capelle and other advocates said they expected the Massachusetts decision to galvanize efforts to persuade other states, particularly those near Massachusetts, to legalize same-sex marriage.
Peter Sprigg, vice president for policy at the Family Research Council, said that in a few states ''there may be some impact.'' But, he said, citing the 26 states with constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage: ''I wouldn't say the other side is gaining momentum. I would say that the other side has just come up for air with the California ruling after a long period of regression.''
Kris Mineau, president of the Massachusetts Family Institute, said the repeal ''will open up a Pandora's box of lawsuits to challenge the marriage requirements in other states.''
Mr. Mineau added, ''And one thing for sure, it will affirm the need for a federal marriage amendment.''

HEADLINE: In Decade of Unlimited Rides, MetroCard Has Transformed How the City Travels

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN; Rebecca White contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The unlimited-ride MetroCard turned 10 this month, a milestone for a thin piece of plastic that has helped usher in a boom in mass transit ridership.
When it was first introduced in the early 1990s, the MetroCard was little more than a substitute token made of plastic. It was not until free MetroCard transfers between subways and buses were instituted in 1997 and the unlimited-ride cards were introduced on July 4, 1998, that the passes fully realized their power to transform the transit system.
Today, many downtown office workers think nothing of hopping on the subway at Wall Street and zipping up to Union Square for lunch. Workers in Midtown might ride a couple of stops to Macy's to get some shopping done during a break. And the number of people using mass transit on weekends has soared as well, as New Yorkers have embraced the subway and bus as a way to get around during their free time, not just for commuting. 
''I think it's absolutely changed travel habits in the New York region, and it's been a boon for the economy as well,'' said Andrew Albert, who represents transit riders on the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
''Where once you might have used it more sparingly because you had a finite number of trips, you're more likely to take a trip during your lunch break, go shopping perhaps or go to dinner somewhere,'' he said.
It did not take long for the unlimited-ride cards to catch on.
In the first month they were available, the unlimited cards accounted for 18 percent of all subway and bus trips, said Lawrence R. Hirsch, who heads the office that forecasts and tracks ridership and fare revenues for New York City Transit. By the end of 1998 the unlimited cards were being used for about a quarter of all trips. By 2003 they accounted for about half. They remain at that level today. Most of those who use unlimited cards buy 7-day or 30-day passes; a smaller number buy 1-day or 14-day passes.
At the same time, ridership has swelled. Last year, the average weekday subway and bus ridership was 7.4 million, up from 5.3 million in 1996, an increase of 40 percent. Average weekend ridership, which includes both Saturday and Sunday, rose to 7.7 million last year, from 4.6 million in 1996, an increase of almost 70 percent.
Other factors have fed the increase, including the growth in the city's economy, the drop in crime and an overall improvement of transit service thanks to billions of dollars of investment in new trains and buses, track and signal equipment and renovated stations. But the unlimited-ride MetroCard has been a major factor in changing how riders use the system.
''We have the highest ridership since April 1950 and there's a reason for it, and the reason is unlimited-ride passes,'' said Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit rider advocacy group that helped push for the unlimited cards.
At the Union Square subway station, Noeva Wong, 54, a lifelong New Yorker who lives in Manhattan, said she regularly buys a 30-day MetroCard. ''I go many more places because the cost of getting around the city is prohibitive if you don't have an unlimited card,'' she said.
Patrick Dougher, 44, who lives in Brooklyn and teaches art at a Manhattan high school, said he uses his weekly card for much more than commuting and does not think twice about jumping on a bus or train. ''I do find I use taxis much, much less,'' he said.
While the unlimited-ride cards are used for roughly half of all rides on buses and subway trains, because the people who use them tend to take more rides than other straphangers, it turns out that considerably fewer than half of all riders have an unlimited-ride card.
In a survey by the transportation authority last year, about 700 riders were asked how they paid for their most recent transit trip. About 23 percent said they had used an unlimited-ride MetroCard. In contrast, 56 percent said they used a pay-per-ride MetroCard, either with or without the volume bonus. Six percent said they had used a single-ride ticket, and 15 percent said they had paid with coins on the bus.
Mr. Hirsch said recent figures showed that people who use the 30-day pass take an average of about 70 rides a month on subways and buses. But many of those rides occur during what transit officials refer to as linked trips, such as when a subway rider transfers to a bus to complete a journey.
A truer picture, Mr. Hirsch said, is given by a further analysis that shows that, on average, holders of the 30-day pass make 56 linked trips a month. With the cost of a 30-day pass at $81, that results in an average fare of $1.45.
Holders of 7-day cards, which cost $25, make 16 linked trips a week, for an average fare of $1.56.
In contrast, a person who buys a bonus pay-per-ride MetroCard has an average fare of $1.74.
The base fare of $2 is paid by people who buy single-ride tickets, who put less than $7 on a pay-per-ride MetroCards or who pay cash on the bus.

GRAPHIC: CHART: The MetroCard Bell Curve: Purchasers of 30-day unlimited MetroCards get about 56 trips per card, on average, but the distribution is skewed: Some riders use the $81 passes for 40 or fewer rides, and a few get more than 100.(Source: Metropolitan Transportation Authority)

HEADLINE: Dow Falls Below 11,000, Despite Drop in Oil Prices

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; David Jolly in Paris and David Stout in Washington contributed reporting

 BODY:
Stocks ended a volatile session in the red on Tuesday, despite a sharp drop in oil prices, after economic policy makers issued dour predictions and skepticism arose about the government's efforts to shore up the nation's financial sector.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended below 11,000 for the first time in two years, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 1.1 percent. 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the beleaguered mortgage finance giants, fell for the fifth day in a row, despite attempts by President Bush and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to reassure investors about the government's rescue plan for the companies. Freddie Mac shares lost 26 percent, and Fannie Mae ended down 27 percent.
Battered bank stocks also closed mostly in the red, although Lehman Brothers managed a 7 percent gain.
In a dizzying day, investors grappled with a spate of mostly bleak economic developments, including pessimistic testimony from Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, who warned that significant economic risks remained and that inflation would accelerate.
The dollar fell to a new low against the euro, General Motors said it would cut jobs and suspend its dividend and a report showed that consumer spending slowed in June more than economists had expected.
Stocks fell sharply in morning trading; the Dow was down 200 points after the opening bell.
But shortly after 10 a.m., as Mr. Bernanke was speaking to Congress, investors did a double-take as oil prices, previously trading at record highs, suddenly plunged by $10 a barrel.
''The only times you've seen moves like that are in the first gulf war,'' Ric Navy, an analyst at BNP Paribas, said.
The surprise development led to a midmorning rally in the stock market, which surged back toward positive territory.
Oil closed down $6.44, at $138.74 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, leaving analysts puzzled.
But the market revival did not last. After seesawing between positive and negative territory, the Dow slid in the late afternoon, closing down 92.65 points at 10,962.54. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index followed a similar trajectory, ending down 13.39 points, or 1.1 percent, at 1,214.91. The Nasdaq composite index closed up 0.1 percent, at 2,215.71.
Mr. Bernanke's gloomy assessment was reinforced by two government reports released Tuesday, one showing that retail sales were nearly stagnant in June, even after Americans received tax rebates from the government's stimulus plan, and the other showing that producer prices rose more than expected, a sign of accelerating inflation.
The trouble in the American stock market followed a painful day in overseas markets. European indexes all closed lower.
In London, the FTSE 100 fell 2.4 percent. The CAC-40 in Paris lost nearly 2 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt slipped 1.9 percent. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 index, a benchmark of European blue chips, fell 2.29 percent.
The dollar fell to a record low against the euro on worries that the American government had taken on an enormous share of the nation's financial risks. The dollar rebounded slightly during the day, and the euro settled at $1.5878.
''The U.S. dollar has come under broad selling pressure amid fear that the U.S. Treasury's contingency plans for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be drawn upon, leading to further strains in the financial system, prolonging the crisis,'' Marc Chandler, a currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, wrote in a note to clients.
General Motors shares rose nearly 5 percent after the company announced more job cuts and a suspension of its dividend. Wachovia fell 7.7 percent after a well-known Wall Street analyst, Meredith Whitney of Oppenheimer & Company, deemed the bank's prospects ''bleak.''
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 9/32, to 100 14/32, as some investors sought safety in government bonds. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, fell to 3.82 percent, from 3.86 percent..
Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills.

HEADLINE: With Warning, G.M. Takes Wide Cost Cuts

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- With concern growing among investors about a possible bankruptcy filing, General Motors on Tuesday announced sweeping cost cuts and other measures to bolster its tenuous cash position.
But even as G.M. unveiled plans to increase its liquidity by $15 billion, the automaker warned of more tough times ahead.
The broad cutbacks included a 20 percent reduction in payroll for salaried workers, elimination of health care for older white-collar retirees, and suspension of G.M.'s annual stock dividend of $1 a share. 
G.M.'s chairman, Rick Wagoner, said the sharp downturn in the American auto market forced ''difficult decisions'' to protect the company's future.
''I'm determined and highly confident that G.M. will be a survivor,'' Mr. Wagoner said in an interview. ''We can do what we need to do.''
Rising gas prices and a weak economy have driven G.M.'s United States sales down 16 percent this year and crippled the market for its big pickups and sport utility vehicles.
The steep fall in sales is eating into G.M.'s cash reserves at the rate of more than $1 billion a month, according to some analysts, provoking fears on Wall Street that the company will run out of money before the market rebounds.
While G.M. had about $24 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter, Mr. Wagoner said the company needed to take drastic action now.
''What we wanted to demonstrate today is that we have a lot of capability to improve liquidity,'' he said.
G.M.'s plan calls for $10 billion in cost cuts, combined with $5 billion in new financing from asset sales and debt offerings.
The automaker developed the plan with the assumption that industrywide vehicle sales in the United States would not rise above 14 million this year or in 2009 -- the lowest sales level in more than a decade.
G.M.'s shares opened lower on Tuesday but rallied to close at $9.84, a gain of about 5 percent.
''This won't solve most of the company's problems, but it will buy them some time,'' said John Casesa of the consulting firm Casesa Shapiro Group.
Analysts generally said that the depth of the cost cuts exceeded their expectations, but that the fund-raising efforts were smaller than anticipated. Moreover, analysts said they were left with more questions than answers about how G.M. would adapt to consumers' rapid shift from large vehicles to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.
''The announcements offered little sense of a new G.M. strategy or shift in organizational culture that might set the stage for a more dramatic reinvention,'' said Brian Johnson of Lehman Brothers.
G.M., the nation's largest automaker, has been struggling for several years to make money in North America and develop passenger cars that compete with models from the Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda.
The company, along with Ford and Chrysler, its Detroit rivals, has relied heavily on sales of pickups and S.U.V.'s for profits.
But the advent of $4-a-gallon gas has dried up the market for bigger vehicles, forcing the Detroit automakers to sharply scale back their production.
G.M. said Tuesday that it would reduce its truck production by 300,000 vehicles by next year, doubling the cutbacks it announced earlier this summer.
The automaker's president, Frederick Henderson, said the reductions would be achieved by accelerating previously announced plant closings in Wisconsin, Ohio, Canada and Mexico, as well as additional downsizing.
''I'm not going to get into today how many additional people will be affected,'' he said. ''These are going to be some pretty tough measures.''
The company also will slash its salary costs by 20 percent by the end of the year through buyouts, early retirements, attrition and possibly layoffs. G.M. has about 40,000 white-collar workers in the United States and Canada.
While G.M. has been methodically cutting jobs since 2006, the decision to eliminate health care benefits for salaried retirees over the age of 65 was unexpected.
The generous health plans for retirees has long been considered a pillar of the benefit system at G.M. The company pledged to increase pensions to offset the loss of coverage.
Still, retirees interviewed Tuesday said that they were blindsided by the move.
One retiree, William Parker of Towson, Md., said he was recently prescribed a new cancer drug that normally costs $2,700 a month, but only $50 under his G.M. plan.
''G.M. was good to me and I hate to be bitter,'' said Mr. Parker, 74, who retired in 1987 after 28 years with G.M. ''But I don't know what the hell I'm going to do. I'm fighting for my life here.''
Other cost-cutting components of the plan included delaying $1.7 billion in payments to a health care trust for retired hourly workers, and the elimination of executive bonuses and pay raises for salaried workers.
Beyond the personnel moves, Mr. Wagoner said G.M. would cut costs in its sales and marketing units, limit its capital spending to $15 billion through 2009, and tighten inventory controls on engines and other parts.
But Mr. Wagoner was less specific on how G.M. would raise additional cash. The company hopes to generate up to $4 billion by selling assets, but executives declined to say what might be sold besides the Hummer S.U.V. brand.
Also, Mr. Wagoner declined to provide details about a planned debt offering to raise $2 billion or more, only that the company would seek the financing when market conditions were most advantageous.
G.M. also said it planned to speed up delivery of some new products, like the Chevrolet Equinox crossover vehicle and the Cadillac CTS coupe.
The scope of initiatives addressed virtually every area of concern voiced by investors about G.M. But the top priority for executives was to quash any further talk that bankruptcy was a possibility for the company.
''At some point, these analysts should learn that car companies don't die that fast,'' said Robert Lutz, G.M.'s vice chairman and chief product officer.

HEADLINE: PLAN TO RESCUE MORTGAGE GIANTS FACES RESISTANCE

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Reporting was contributed by Steven Lee Myers, Stephen Labaton and David M. Herszenhorn in Washington, and Michael M. Grynbaum in New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A sense of economic gloom gripped Washington on Tuesday as President Bush urged Americans not to lose faith, the Federal Reserve chairman offered a mostly bleak assessment of the difficulties ahead for the economy, and the administration's latest effort to help the housing sector faced tough questioning in Congress.
Despite widespread concern about losses suffered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two giant housing finance companies, the Bush administration's call for quick passage of legislation to authorize the use of government funds to save them ran into heavy fire, especially among some Republicans concerned about taxpayer liability.
The opposition threatened to slow down the rescue plan, especially if lawmakers insist on making major changes to the package, which would allow the Bush administration to use the United States Treasury to help Fannie and Freddie by lending them money and buying their stock. 
The latest trouble in the financial markets, rising energy prices and spreading joblessness were also sowing new discord among lawmakers, with Democrats calling for, and Republicans resisting, a new round of spending programs and tax cuts to stimulate the economy.
A day after reports of losses by regional banks, causing some depositors to pull their money out, Mr. Bush held an unscheduled news conference at which he felt compelled to remind Americans that their deposits were insured up to $100,000.
''My hope is that people take a deep breath and realize that their deposits are protected by our government,'' the president said. He added that economic growth ''was not the growth we'd like'' but expressed confidence that the country would overcome ''a time of uncertainty.'' The nation's troubled financial system is ''basically sound,'' he added.
Reacting to the latest dismal news, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down almost 93 points after a roller-coaster session, with the shares of the two mortgage finance companies continuing their steep slide. Fannie Mae fell 27 percent and Freddie Mac, 26 percent.
The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, avoided the word ''recession'' but presented a generally gloomy picture, saying that consumer spending and exports were keeping growth ''at a sluggish pace'' while the housing sector ''continues to weaken.''
''The economy has continued to expand, but at a subdued pace,'' Mr. Bernanke said at another point. In one rare note of optimism, he revised upward the Fed's growth estimate for the year and added that consumer spending had somewhat exceeded expectations.
The Fed chief spent the early morning testifying alone, as part of his twice-a-year appearances before Congress, and then joined Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sitting with them, he endorsed Mr. Paulson's plan, unveiled on Sunday, to seek legislation to give the federal government temporary power to help Fannie and Freddie, and he also defended the Fed's opening its own lending facility to the two agencies.
Mr. Bernanke offered no timetable for improved economic performance, declaring that while the risks to the overall economy were still ''skewed to the downside,'' inflation ''seems likely to move temporarily higher in the near term.'' The Fed, he said, needed to guard against higher prices' spreading through the economy.
That mixed warning about rising costs and a downturn reinforced the message of last month's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy-making body, that it would not cut interest rates further and, indeed, that higher rates might be necessary to combat inflation.
Despite snaking around branches of IndyMac Bank and a report from the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that more banks were expected to run into trouble, Mr. Bernanke said he did not think there was a significant danger to the banking sector, most of which he said remained profitable.
''Of course, all banks are being challenged by credit conditions now,'' the Fed chief said in response to a question from Senator Richard C. Shelby, an Alabama Republican on the banking panel. ''The good news is that the banking system did come into this episode extremely well capitalized, extremely profitable.''
But concerns that consumer banking could succumb to the ills of the credit crisis clearly rattled official Washington, as Mr. Bush's citation of the federal government's insurance of bank deposits made clear.
''The bottom line is this: We're going through a tough time,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But our economy's continued growing, consumers are spending, businesses are investing, exports continue increasing and American productivity remains strong.''
The main reasons for Mr. Bernanke's sober assessment, he told senators, were rising commodity prices, especially energy, and continued weakness in the housing sector. He suggested that housing prices might turn around next year, but that high energy prices were likely to persist because demand was outstripping supply.
Over all, he suggested in his initial comments, economic growth ''is projected to pick up gradually over the next two years.''
The Fed chief's discussion of energy issues provoked some of the liveliest exchanges of the day as several Democrats and some Republicans suggested that heavy investment in the futures market was artificially driving prices upward.
He said several times that he did not view ''speculation'' as necessarily bad, adding that some investors, like airlines, needed to buy energy futures to hedge against volatility in prices. Rather than blame speculators, or even ''manipulation'' of the market, Mr. Bernanke, a former professor of economics at Princeton, sought to explain to senators that energy prices were driven by fundamental factors.
''Over the past several years, the world economy has expanded at its fastest pace in decades, leading to substantial increases in the demand for oil,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''On the supply side, despite sharp increases in prices, the production of oil has risen only slightly in the past few years.''
He also dismissed the suggestion that the precipitous fall in the value of the dollar against other currencies had contributed to high oil prices. Some economists say that because oil is priced in dollars and the value of the dollar has weakened -- in part because of low interest rates fostered by the Fed -- investors are fleeing to commodities, driving their prices up.
He said that the decline in the dollar had ''contributed somewhat'' to higher oil prices but insisted that the ''principal drivers'' were supply and demand.
As always, senators sought assurances that Mr. Bernanke understood that average Americans were suffering even if the economy itself was not technically in a recession.
Mr. Bush, at his news conference, also sought to demonstrate that he understood the hardships of Americans. ''It's been a difficult time for many American families who are coping with declining housing values and high gasoline prices.''
When asked about his statement in February that he had not heard forecasts that gasoline prices could reach $4 a gallon, Mr. Bush interrupted and replied, ''Aware of it now.''
Mr. Bernanke was asked many times whether he would endorse the call by some Democrats for a new stimulus package, but each time he demurred, saying it was too early to draw conclusions.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is head of the Senate banking panel, cited another Democratic theme, that a stimulus package should contain money to build roads, bridges and other infrastructure.
Mr. Bernanke said such projects might be worthy, but spending for them would not provide an immediate lift to the economy because of the lag time between approving large construction programs and spending the funds.

HEADLINE: Tracing Family Roots in Vilnius

BYLINE: MATT GROSS


HIGHLIGHT: The Frugal Traveler discovers the Lithuanian capital, once the intellectual heart of the Eastern European Jewish world, and visits the town where his ancestors lived, prayed and died more than a century ago. 

 BODY:
In much of Europe, the Old Town is the only town that matters. Centuries-old stone houses, crammed into shoulder-width alleyways that swerve at random and wind uphill toward ancient churches dedicated to forgotten saints - this is, to many of us, what Europe is all about. But Old Towns often give me pause: Will the quaintness mask a lack of vitality? Is it a museum for tourists, or a place where locals live, work and play? And if the Old Town is boring, will the New Town - the less-densely populated, less charming sprawl outside the medieval city walls - be any better?
In Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, I needn't have worried. Its Old Town is easily my favorite in Europe (sorry, Dubrovnik), a vast, fun web of alleys lined with elegant, straight-backed buildings that reminded me of Scandinavia. (Danes, I'm told, see them as very Russian.) Modern-day pilgrims - women sporting severely fashionable bangs, men who've mastered geek chic - flock to the 18th-century neo-Classical Vilnius Cathedral in the heart of the Old Town, not to pray but to hang out in the broad piazza. From there, they proceed up glossy Gedimino Prospect or cobblestoned Pilies Street, perhaps ducking under a low, concealed archway to grab a beer or three at one of the innumerable courtyard cafes.
It was in one such cafe that Regina Kopilevich sat across from me last Thursday and asked the question I had been waiting a lifetime to hear. Placing her hand atop the pile of papers in front of her and opening her clear blue eyes extra wide, she leaned forward and said, in slightly accented English, "Would you like to know your name?"
A simple question for most, but for the descendants of Eastern Europeans who immigrated to the United States at the turn of the last century, it can be a fraught mystery. Eager to assimilate, our ancestors shortened their unpronounceable alien monikers into names that would be easier on American ears and tongues. In the New World, the Old World was irrelevant. 
For my family perhaps more than some. My great-grandparents were born in the 19th century, in the lands then referred to as Russia but that encompassed Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and beyond. And all somehow decided, as they embarked on new lives, never to discuss the past with their children. Growing up, I heard but a single story about our family: that my mother's great-grandfather owned a mill, and broke his neck when his beard got caught in its works. Other than that, I had only my name, Gross - which my elementary-school classmates kindly ensured I would never forget.
But my name, it turns out, is not Gross.
It's Grossmitz.
So began my week in Lithuania, an exploration of a culture that the Grand Tourists of the 18th century would have bypassed completely. Those wealthy Englishmen were preoccupied with the Greco-Roman world - the basis of their civilization - but these days we have to acknowledge a wider range of influences, whether they're African, Asian or, in my case, Eastern European Jewish. 
And from the late 14th century up to World War II, Lithuania was the intellectual heart of the Eastern European Jewish world. Mostly free from the pogroms that afflicted them in neighboring lands, the Jewish community thrived, and Vilnius became a spiritual center, with 100 synagogues, almost 100,000 Jewish residents and, in the 18th century, a leader so wise and respected he is simply referred to as the Vilna Gaon - the Teacher of Vilnius. 
Lithuania today is hardly the country my great-grandfather Morris Gross left a century ago. Now it's better known as a dynamic Baltic State, one of the successful countries - along with Estoniaand Latvia-to emerge from the collapse of the Soviet Union. And it remains affordable. My accommodations - the Bernardinu B&B (5 Bernardinu Street, 370-5-260-8410, www.vilniusbandb.lt), a 400-year-old courtyard home just off hip Pilies Street - cost 160 litas a night, or about 46 euros at a fixed rate of 3.45 litas to the euro. (That's about $75, at 2.20 litas to the dollar.) And my restaurant meals never topped 35 litas, no matter how much well-brewed beer I consumed. The SIM card for my cellphone was the cheapest I've seen in 50 countries: a mere 4 litas.
Still, as I wandered the Old Town, I was watching every penny. Getting here was not cheap. With flights from Bucharesttopping $450, I opted for the cheaper overnight train to Chisinau, Moldova (101.18 new Romanian lei, or $45 at 2.3 lei to $1), then Air Baltic flight 411 to Vilnius (101.70 euros, or about $162 at $1.62 to the euro). The 24-hour-long journey still totaled 130 euros - more than a day's budget. 
More worryingly, I had to pay Regina, a multilingual researcher that I had hired to help me research my family roots. She'd worked 15 years at the Lithuanian State Historical Archives before going freelance and had come highly recommended by my distant cousin Rajmiel Odinec (on my mother's side), who appreciated her just-the-facts approach. Other guides, he warned, "embellish things and create stories" to please hopeful clients. 
Regina's expertise, I learned shortly after learning my own name, would cost me 50 litas an hour. That did not include the 600 litas for the research she had done before my arrival, the extent of which she hadn't hinted at in the e-mails we'd exchanged. Along with an afternoon in the archives, and a day trip to visit my great-grandfather's hometown, I was looking at a minimum of 1,200 litas. 
This was, uh, not exactly frugal, and as we rode a city bus (1.10 litas) to the Archives, my stomach was churning with anxiety. At what point would I have to tell Regina "no more"? And what kind of Grossmitz was I to economize at the cost of family history, to say that I could afford one uncle's name but not another's? 
I calmed down as soon as we entered the Archives' sunlit research room, and wavy-haired Regina produced a stack of ancient ledgers with pages crumbling to dust - the fruits of her expensive prep work. These were the records, kept by the Russian government that controlled the region in the 19th century, detailing births, deaths and marriages in the Jewish community of Marijampole, my great-grandfather Morris's hometown, about 86 miles west, near the Polish border.
The recorded history of the Grossmitz family begins on Feb. 9, 1829, with the marriage of Mowsha, son of Berko and Freyda Grossmitz, to Dobra, daughter of Berko and Sora Braskowicz. On Dec. 15 of that same year, their daughter Freyda was born, beginning a 20-year run of babymaking that produced Abram Itzko, Berko, Gabriel, Esther, Liba and Jankiel Judel.
Every fact, no matter how insignificant, was a nugget to be savored. Mowsha, potentially my great-great-great-grandfather, was a tailor! His nephew Chaim a shoemaker! 
We traced the lineage through the decades, inching closer to the 1885 birth of Moshe Grossmitz - that is, Morris Gross, who at the age of 16 would leave Marijampole and wind up in Bridgeport, Conn. But after 1874 the trail ran cold. For most of the next 25 years, the ledgers are missing, offering no insight into how Morris fit into the Grossmitz lineage or why he had left Marijampole in the first place. Regina had a theory: Morris Gross might have been fleeing conscription into the Russian army. If true, it would be a great irony, for the only document that cited Marijampole as his birthplace (recently found by my father on Ancestry.com) was his World War IIdraft card.
With all of these fresh facts at hand, I still knew little of the lives the Grossmitzes led. The Vilna Gaon Jewish State Museum (three locations; www.jmuseum.lt) provided some answers. Litvaks, as the Jewish Lithuanians were known, were traditionalists, seeking truth in the Torah and resisting assimilation, but many also joined the Haskala, or Jewish Enlightenment, and made significant marks as scientists, academics and artists. Between the wars, an art scene flourished, and many of the paintings and woodcuts from the so-called "Lost World" are on display at the museum's Center of Tolerance (10/2 Naugarduko Street). 
The museum's Green House (12 Pamenkalnio Street) also shows quite graphically how 90 to 95 percent of Lithuania's 250,000 Jews were murdered. The Nazis invaded in June 1941 and in July, with the often eager aid of Lithuanians, began an organized slaughter of Jews, communists and the mentally ill. One chilling German document lists the number of people killed, day by day, village by village, sweeping across Lithuania from west to east. The second village on the list is Marijampole.
Eerier still is the Paneriai, the woods five miles southwest of Vilnius where almost all of the city's Jews were killed, their bodies dumped in six pits originally dug to store oil. Along with Regina - who generously agreed to halve her fee to 600 litas - I visited after the Archives and found nothing but calm woods. I tried to imagine the deathly scene, but kept getting distracted by the trill of birdsong and the sweetness of wild strawberry patches. 
In fact, much of Vilnius was like that - so pleasant that I couldn't visualize the Old Town as the dismal ghetto of old. When I wasn't delving into my past, I was being shown a good time by my friend Jonas Oskinis, who led me from sidewalk cafes where we'd munch sliced pig ear (a traditional Lithuanian beer snack) and drink beers at Woo (22 Vilniaus Street, 370-5-212-7740, www.woo.lt), a cream-colored basement cocktail lounge that's a quintessential Vilnius-hipster hangout. 
For meals, we'd settle into the courtyard of the Vilnius Teachers' House (39 Vilniaus Street, 370-5-212-2603, www.kultura.lt) for expertly grilled trout (21 litas) or head to Busi Trecias (18 Totoriu Street, 370-5-231-2698), a cozy pub that serves a Lithuanian fry-up of potatoes, bacon, mushrooms and cream (a good hangover remedy if you indulge in too much of their excellent dark beer and apple-tinged brandy).
When my head cleared from the partying, I could see that very little of Jewish life had survived the twin assaults of the Holocaust and the Soviet era. Sabbath services at Vilnius's only remaining synagogue (39 Pylimo Street, 370-5-261-2523) drew about 25 elderly people, who prayed by the light of compact fluorescent bulbs. So instead, I caught the two-and-a-half-hour train (18 litas) to Marijampole.
It was a pretty little town of 50,000, with tree-lined boulevards and a few old brick buildings that were around in my great-grandfather's day: one stamped 1890, another a long, vaulted flower market. Weddings were in progress at two of the churches, and I watched one bride and groom drive off in a roadster, trailed by burly bikers.
On this sunny summer's day, the Sesupe River, which divides the town in half, was achingly beautiful. Ducks and children swam among the reeds, and shirtless men cast fishing lines into its slow currents. But upstream, in the crook of an oxbow - where a mare and her foal were grazing - was Marijampole's killing site, where some 7,000 to 8,000 Jews were murdered on Sept. 1, 1941, according to a town history written by former resident Joseph Rosin. 
Across the river was what had been Marijampole's Jewish neighborhood, but now it was nothing but a New Town, dotted with slope-roofed wooden houses and damp-looking concrete towers from the Soviet era. Next to the main road, however, I found the remnants of Marijampole's Jewish cemetery. The 11 surviving tombstones had been set in a ring around a mound of earth covered in clover and daisies, and I walked from one to another, trying to make out the Hebrew inscriptions. Some were worn away to nothing, although I did spot a couple of Moshes. 
Here, at least, I knew, was the resting place of my ancestors. For a century or more, they'd lived, prayed and died within a few miles of this tranquil spot. Until, of course, one of them had abandoned his family and departed for a distant land, with little money in his pocket and no idea what he'd find there.
I knew just how he felt.
Next stop: Gdansk, Poland.

HEADLINE: U.S. Report Shows Spike in Energy Costs for Households in New York Region

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
From May to June, the cost of residential energy use in the New York metropolitan region shot up by 10.8 percent, the biggest increase in any month on record, according to the latest report on inflation from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price of electricity, which rose more than 15 percent in that period, was the main driver of the overall cost of household energy. 
 Power bills have been rising fast in the region as utilities have passed on the surging cost of fuel. Locally, the price of fuel oil was more than 75 percent higher than in June 2007. Con Edison said last week that residential customers would be charged about 22 percent more this summer than last.
 Over the past year, the cost of household energy has risen more than 18 percent, according to the report. The escalation of energy prices easily eclipsed the fast rise in the cost of food. Prices of groceries and other food consumed at home rose 6.4 percent in the past year, which was the largest change in any 12-month period since June 2004. 
 The overall rate of consumer price increases in the metropolitan area in the last 12 months was 4.5 percent. That was the highest annual rate of inflation in the region in almost two years but was lower than the national rate for the past year, 5 percent. From May to June, the local inflation rate was 1 percent. 
 In the metropolitan area, the only prices that have not been rising sharply have been for discretionary items, like clothing, household furnishings and entertainment, the report showed. 
 The price of clothing in the region dropped more than 5 percent last month and is down by more than 3 percent over the past year, a reflection of the weakening job market, said Michael L. Dolfman, the regional commissioner of labor statistics.
 ''When the job market is strong, people go out and buy some clothes, interview suits,'' Mr. Dolfman said.
 Rising rents also contributed to the surge in the cost of living. In the metropolitan area, rents rose 0.7 percent in June, about double the rate recorded in each of the previous seven months. Over the past year, rents have risen 4.8 percent, the report showed.

HEADLINE: A Filipino Embrace

BYLINE: By RAPHAEL BARTHOLOMEW

DATELINE: MANILA 

 BODY:
For N.B.A. players making their first visit to the Philippines, the adoration of fans can be flattering and startling.
 ''They make you feel like you're a god,'' said Gilbert Arenas, who recently spent three days promoting his new line of sneakers. ''When my N.B.A. career is done, I have to play here one year just to feel that.'' 
 Arenas, 26, sometimes jokes that being the Washington Wizards' franchise player makes him ''the black president.'' Sure enough, this tour gave him a taste of presidential life. 
 When he landed at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, Arenas was met by a horde of television and newspaper videographers and photographers who followed him throughout his three days in Manila. Arenas said that he was so taken aback by the size and opulence of his presidential suite at the Peninsula Manila Hotel that he took pictures to prove he stayed there. 
 To visit Adidas stores, he traveled in a motorcade of dark sport utility vehicles with an escort of three police motorcycles. Before he arrived at each site, bomb-sniffing dogs swept the areas, and brawny Adidas-clad security guards wearing Secret Service-style earpieces set up barricades to corral the fans who had crowded mall walkways to catch a glimpse of him. (The sportswear company is one of Arenas's sponsors.)
 ''It was like nothing I've ever seen before, and I've seen crazy fans all over the world,'' Arenas wrote on his NBA.com blog. He also offered this advice to his fellow N.B.A. players: ''If you're having a bad day or you're having a bad career, go to Manila. They'll bring your spirits up.''
 This country's love of basketball may surprise the players, but it is well known to sportswear companies, which have been sending American stars to Manila for years. Despite its small population and weak economy compared with other Asian markets like China, India and Japan, the Philippines consistently cracks the top four in rankings of Asian basketball sales for Adidas, according to Joey Singian, the managing director of Adidas Philippines.
 The sneaker companies reward the country for such dedicated consumption by sending their star endorsers to visit. Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers and Tracy McGrady of the Houston Rockets have been to Manila twice in the past 10 years, and it is rare for an N.B.A. off-season to pass without at least one stopover by a star player. That visit is usually followed by a jump in sales of that player's signature merchandise, and of basketball products in general, Singian said.
 Even non-sportswear companies try to tap the interest here. They sponsor teams in the Philippine Basketball Association and give them corporate-themed names, like the Magnolia Beverage Masters and Santa Lucia Realtors.
 The way fans climbed over one another during the Fourth of July weekend to touch Arenas's hand was reminiscent of a papal visit. Some went in for high-fives, grabbed his hand and would not let go until security guards pried away their fingers. 
 Reynar Monteclaro, a 21-year-old college graduate from Zamboanga del Norte on the southern island of Mindanao, howled after Arenas signed his plush toy basketball. Monteclaro said he made the cross-country journey to Manila just to see Arenas.
 During other moments of Arenas's tour, his reception was more like that of a pop star. At an exhibition in the atrium of a mall in Quezon City, Adidas set up bleachers and a half court at which Arenas gave interviews and shot one-handed 3-pointers. More than 1,000 spectators watched from the ground floor and looked down from walkways on the upper levels. 
 ''I feel like Jay-Z in the States,'' Arenas told the crowd. ''I don't get this kind of love in Washington.''
 He did, however, find a measure of appreciation when he returned from his trip to sign a six-year, $111 million contract with the Wizards. He accepted less money than he was originally offered.
 Arenas's easygoing nature made his visit to Manila different. Several players who arrive here are ''not the Mr. Congeniality types,'' said Odette Velarde, an Adidas marketing manager. They set limits for the number of autographs they will sign in a day, for how many appearances they will make and for how many shots they will demonstrate during coaching clinics. Arenas's only requests were to have VitaminWater and an Xbox for his hotel room. 
 He signed jerseys, and even chessboards, and stayed behind to greet fans until his handlers dragged him away. He interrupted dinner service at a local restaurant when the kitchen staff stopped cooking to have a picture taken with him. 
 In 2007, Nike's marketing efforts included an exhibit showcasing local collectors' rarest and flashiest sneakers; the premiere of ''My Game,'' a documentary that blended pastoral scenes of Filipino teenagers playing basketball on dirt courts with the life stories of local players Nike endorses; and a much-hyped trip to Manila by Bryant in September. 
 Early this year, Adidas won a contract to provide uniforms for the Ateneo de Manila and De La Salle University programs, the country's most popular college teams. This stoked tensions with Nike, which had signed most of the varsity basketball players to individual endorsement deals before Adidas secured rights to the uniforms. 
 In the Philippines, no rules forbid amateur athletes from becoming paid endorsers. The corporate rivalry became bitter when Nike representatives were said to have told their players to wear as much Nike apparel as possible to an Adidas photo shoot. 
 The sneaker war re-emerged during Arenas's trip, when he was scheduled to appear with Kristie A. Kenney, the United States ambassador, at a game between Ateneo and La Salle. Manny Pacquiao, the Filipino world champion boxer and a Nike athlete, was also invited to receive a university award that Adidas employees considered a veiled attempt to upstage Arenas.
 The intrigue, however, barely seemed to affect Arenas. Amid rumors that Nike planned to beam in a message from Bryant via a live feed on the big screen, Arenas walked to his courtside seat while the crowd of more than 16,000 gave him a booming ovation.
 And, in a manner to match his nickname, he shook the hand of almost everyone he passed along the way.

HEADLINE: 2 All-Beef Patties Are Back

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
The year was 1974: gas prices were high, inflation was rampant and an unpopular Republican occupied the White House. McDonald's introduced a spirit-lifting jingle: ''Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame-seed bun.'' 
 Now it is 2008, and McDonald's is reviving it as a TV commercial. The company has asked consumers to write their own songs using the exact words of the jingle, and submit them to a contest on MySpace.com. The official reason is this year's 40th anniversary of the Big Mac, but the then-and-now cultural similarities are not entirely lost on the company.
 ''That might be coincidental -- unhappily, maybe, but coincidental,'' said Marlena Peleo-Lazar, chief creative officer for McDonald's U.S.A. The contest, she said, was dreamed up in the spirit of summer fun and the hamburger's birthday. ''Big Mac is just an iconic product for us, and it is a customer favorite,'' she said. 
 Nevertheless, the jingle itself suggests getting a whole lot of food -- for what consumers know is a low price. The message seems to resonate in today's economy, which is why chains like Quiznos, and Subway have been marketing the fact that $5 can fill your stomach at their restaurants, no matter how little it does for your gas tank. 
 Today a Big Mac in New York costs $3.79, which is still less than a gallon of gas; in 1974, the price in New York was 85 cents, which was significantly more than a gallon of gas. 
 Of course, there are also huge differences between today's world and the one that existed when the jingle first appeared. In 1974, people were busy following President Richard Nixon's downfall and tracking whether it was an odd- or an even-numbered day, when gas buying was restricted based on license plates. Nobody had heard of a mash-up or a Web site. 
 But today the McDonald's channel of choice is a social networking site geared to people who were not yet born in 1974. Nevertheless, nearly 1,000 songs have been submitted, and judges have selected five finalists. The public has been invited to vote, and a winner will be announced Tuesday. In keeping with the tone of today's economy, the winner won't get any cash, but his or her song will be featured in a commercial later this month.
 McDonald's advertising agency, DDB Worldwide, created the video component, which is available on the MySpace contest site; users have been asked to provide only the soundtrack.
 ''We knew there were a lot of consumers out there that would remember the chant, but we also felt like the younger audience was familiar with it, and we wanted them to give us a contemporary version,'' said Jaime Guerrero, account director at Tribal DDB Worldwide in Chicago, part of the DDB Worldwide unit of Omnicom, which handled the online campaign.
 People can still watch some of the vintage commercials on YouTube, one of which ends with the period catchphrase, ''Far out!'' YouTube also features a few modern riffs on the jingle, but those videos have a bit less charm; in one example, a group of young men in a car rap the ''Two all-beef patties'' mantra into a McDonald's drive-through speaker box.
 Among the official contest submissions on MySpace, the entries range from a yearning country song (''I wanna give to ya, two all-beef patties. ...'') to rap (''Load up the homeys in the car, get the keys, now we're off on a Mickey D's run/I want two all-beef patties. ...''). There are five music genres that contestants can choose from; the majority of entries are hip-hop.
 Quincy Alexander Mosley, a 21-year-old music producer from Bethlehem, Pa., submitted a track to the R&B category called ''SupaSize Dat.'' Although he is not a regular Big Mac eater, he said, he decided to enter the contest after hearing a radio ad; the idea for his submission came after ''a burst of inspiration.''
 ''The sesame-seed, that part right there, threw me off for a minute,'' he said, in terms of fitting the syllables into the rhythm. ''I heard a lot of submissions on there that, when I heard them, it sounded like they was struggling with that word,'' he said.
 McDonald's is not the only company glancing backward for inspiration. Unilever's Klondike is offering a $100,000 prize for the best video answer to the question, ''What Would You Do for a Klondike Bar?'' Citigroup has revived ''Citi Never Sleeps,'' and Burger King wants you to ''Have It Your Way.'' 
 ''There's no doubt that all the consumer-confidence stuff is a little rocky these days, and we're all looking for a little bit of reassurance,'' said Kendra Gale, an assistant professor in the school of journalism and mass communication at the University of Colorado in Boulder. ''There's certainly something comforting about it.''
 For companies, reviving a campaign through user-generated submissions can appeal to older consumers' nostalgia while introducing a classic campaign to a younger set. There is a small risk that companies can seem out of touch by asking the MySpace generation to play with their parents' (or grandparents') taglines.
 ''That's the biggest paradox to me,'' said William J. Jurewicz, the chief executive of Space150, a digital marketing agency in Minneapolis that is not involved with the McDonald's promotion. ''They're going after a very young group with a very old jingle, and not necessarily correlating how cool and retro and throwback it was.''
 While McDonald's has brought back the ''Two all-beef patties'' line occasionally -- with advertisements in 1996 and 2003, and some international use -- the ''Big Mac Chant-Off'' on MySpace is the first user-generated contest in the United States and ''is much more expansive'' than previous revivals, said Ms. Peleo-Lazar of McDonald's.
 A creator of the jingle, Keith Reinhard, who directed the team at Needham, Harper & Steers that made the original campaign, said he was ''thrilled'' by its return.
 The concept was born of ''exasperation,'' said Mr. Reinhard, chairman emeritus of DDB Worldwide. His agency had wanted to use a parody of the song ''One'' from ''A Chorus Line'' to promote the burger, but McDonald's insisted that the ingredients of the Big Mac be listed in the ad.
 One night in Mr. Reinhard's office, the team scrawled the ingredients on an easel. His partner, Dan Nichols, ''had his guitar with him at all times,'' Mr. Reinhard said. ''And I suggested, because music is a great mnemonic, I said, remember how we told our kids to learn the ABCs with sort of a dumb tuneless chant?''
 He continued, ''And Dan Nichols -- this is my very clear recollection -- he's looking at the easel and he plays on his guitar: 'Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame-seed bun.' And that was it. The rest was history.''
 In the current contest, McDonald's insists that the jingle be reproduced in full and the ingredients named in the correct order. In other requirements, the songs must be free of violence, say nothing disparaging about McDonald's, and make no mention of illegal activity. 
 The results range from the ear-piercing (a rushed repetition of the phrase as a baby wails) to some tracks that seem good enough to play on the radio. Because the entire phrase must be repeated, many entries sound similar.
 ''When you sign onto this, you take the bad with the good,'' said Ms. Peleo-Lazar of McDonald's. ''But we thought being really relevant and interesting outweighed the risk.''

HEADLINE: Senate Report Examines Role of Banks in Tax Evasion

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
The secrecy surrounding offshore bank accounts was pierced Wednesday by a Senate report that examined how UBS, the big Swiss bank, and LGT, which is run by the royal family of Liechtenstein, helped wealthy individuals evade American taxes. The 115-page report, prepared by Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, laid out how eight individuals used offshore accounts to dodge taxes. 
 Three of the eight are Frank Lowy, the Australian billionaire who runs the Westfield Group, the world's largest owner of shopping centers; Richard M. Chong, a venture capitalist; and Harvey Greenfield, the owner of the Commonwealth Toy and Novelty Company, which sells Beverly Hills Pups. A lawyer for Mr. Lowy, Robert Bennett, called the report ''biased and misleading.'' The others did not respond to telephone calls or e-mails on Wednesday. 
 The report also said Prince Phillipp of Liechtenstein helped wealthy individuals evade taxes by meeting with them in his role as chairman of LGT. Prince Phillipp is the brother to the reigning sovereign, Hans-Adam II, and the uncle of Liechtenstein's hereditary prince, Alois. 
 Liechtenstein's embassy in Washington issued a statement Wednesday saying authorities in the principality would examine the findings carefully. ''If any violations of Liechtenstein law have occurred, the appropriate steps will be taken,'' the statement said.
 The report comes amid a widening investigation by federal prosecutors into the private banking practices of UBS, the world's largest private bank. Two senior UBS executives are scheduled to testify Thursday before the Senate panel.
 The hearing will also include videotaped testimony from Heinrich Kieber, a German citizen and a former low-level employee of LGT, who is in the witness protection program. 
 In recent years, Mr. Kieber stole LGT client records and turned them over to German authorities, igniting a tax-evasion probe in Germany. Some of the records have made their way to the Internal Revenue Service, which is investigating 100 American citizens with LGT accounts. 
 In the videotape, Mr. Kieber is disguised and his voice is altered. The royal family of Liechtenstein has hired private detectives to track him down. 
 Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat whose staff ran the investigation, said in a statement on Wednesday, ''Tax havens are engaged in economic warfare against the United States, and the honest, hardworking American taxpayer is losing.''
 He and Senator Norm Coleman, the Minnesota Republican who is the subcommittee's ranking member, called for the Treasury and the I.R.S. to tighten reporting rules enacted in 2001 under a program meant to combat offshore tax evasion, which the subcommittee estimates at $70 billion a year by individuals.
 According to the report, the Lowy family was one of LGT's largest clients. After a run-in with Australian tax authorities, Mr. Lowy used the bank to set up foundations in Liechtenstein, including one, Luperla, that sought to funnel $100 million in assets back to the family through a Delaware corporation. 
 While LGT typically required clients to travel to Liechtenstein or Switzerland to set up their affairs, the bank made an exception for the Lowys. 
 At the Lowys' request, LGT also removed all traces of the family's LGT accounts and transactions when setting up Luperla. It also kept the Lowy name and those of affiliated entities off the founding documents for Luperla, and put an LGT trust officer in charge of the foundation.
 The report said that despite the maze of foundations and Delaware corporations behind Luperla, internal LGT documents show that Luperla's financial beneficiaries are Mr. Lowy and his three sons. By 2001, at least $68 million had flowed into Luperla to the Lowys.
 Prince Phillipp, the report said, courted clients for LGT. At a March 2001 meeting in Vaduz, the Liechtenstein capital, the prince met with members of the Greenfield family to persuade them to move a $30 million offshore trust at another bank to LGT. 
 While it is not clear whether the Greenfields moved all of the money in that account, by 2001 LGT had set up a Liechtenstein foundation for the family that used two British Virgin Islands corporations to transfer at least $2.2 million. The report also details the brisk marketing efforts by UBS to win new clients in the United States. 
 The report cites a 2007 e-mail message from a senior UBS private banker that urges colleagues to bring in new client money. ''The markets are growing fast, and our competition is catching up. The answer to guarantee our future is GROWTH,'' the banker wrote. 
 UBS, which is cooperating with authorities in the investigation, had no comment Wednesday on the report.

HEADLINE: Gross Out and Knockoff, but Hardly Any Sendup

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
''Hurl!,'' an extreme eating contest on the cable channel G4, has a certain elegance, an economy of action and intent that is too often lacking in contemporary ballet or fine dining. Contestants, almost all male, eat as much as they can in one sitting, then exert themselves in a strenuous physical activity. He who eats the most and vomits the least wins $1,000.
 As the show's premiere on Tuesday suggested, ''Hurl!'' will not win any public service awards from the National Eating Disorders Association. It revels in ''hurl cams,'' close-ups of young players power-gobbling tubs of macaroni and cheese, and instant replays of the losers puking. And like so much summer cable fare, it is basically a straight-to-YouTube event, a spectacle that only teenage boys want to watch in full or at any length at all. But just because it is puerile and revolting, doesn't mean it is stupid. ''Hurl!'' has a disarming ''Jackass'' knowingness: it is tongue-in-cheek as well as face-in-bucket. 
 ''Athletes have long understood the connection between what they eat and how they perform,'' a gravel-voiced narrator intones as a supermarket cart careens through well-stocked aisles. ''But tonight a new breed of competitor will find that these things are now one and the same.''
 ''Hurl!,'' like ''Reality Bites Back'' and ''The Gong Show'' (back-to-back shows that begin tonight on Comedy Central), are attempts at satire. And at least in that sense they are almost quixotically brave. It turns out that it is as impossible to parody the fearless, effervescent vulgarity of shows like ABC's ''I Survived a Japanese Game Show'' or NBC's ''America's Got Talent'' as it is to outfiddle Yo-Yo Ma or undersell Costco. 
 Remakes also try for archness, but those that work best don't mess with the original. Last October Drew Carey proved himself a perfect successor to Bob Barker on ''The Price Is Right'' by not trying to be funny or different. ''Celebrity Family Feud,'' which had its premiere this month, is a drag because guests like Ice-T or Joan Rivers feel obliged to stay true to their onstage personas. (Though it's always entertaining to see Hollywood families that are stretched to include personal assistants.) 
 ''The Gong Show,'' hosted by the stand-up comic Dave Attell, is a reprise of the 1970s show with Chuck Barris that was itself a parody of variety shows and talent contests. Three comedians act as judges for acts that are too scatological for network television but no more improbable than the average ''America's Got Talent'' audition: a hugely fat man lies on the floor under 2,000 pounds of human weight: 15 girls in bikinis and stiletto heels. The judges say crude things but not very wittily. 
 ''Reality Bites Back,'' which follows it on Comedy Central, is a little more successful. It's a deadpan sendup of all the cheesiest reality shows from ''The Real World'' to ''The Mole,'' and it captures all the usual highlights, from the smarmy host who recaps constantly, to catty cutaways and slow-motion flashbacks. Ten comedians live together and engage in absurd competitions. Before the games begin, one housemate, Jeff, turns out to have already left. ''Do we even have enough tape of him to make a slow-motion music montage?'' the host Michael Ian Black asks. An elegiac tribute to Jeff follows, only Jeff is never at the center of any frame and has to be pointed out with arrows.
 But once again even the most acid mockery cannot match the exquisite cynicism and self-parody of Tuesday's episode of ''America's Got Talent.'' 
 After a series of eccentric acts that included dueling accordion players and a man who imitates barnyard animal noises came Donald Braswell. This improbably handsome, well-dressed car salesman from San Antonio said that after he damaged his vocal cords in a car accident, he was told he would never sing again. As Mr. Braswell began crooning a Josh Groban hit, ''You Raise Me Up,'' powerfully and in perfect pitch, the audience jeered and gave him the thumbs-down sign, then suddenly and en masse switched to tears, cheers and a standing ovation. It was a heavily choreographed moment borrowed from last year's ''Britain's Got Talent'' contest, when Paul Potts, a shy, chubby cellphone salesman, sang Puccini's ''Nessun Dorma'' and brought down the house. 
 Mr. Braswell's triumph, heavily promoted in advance by NBC, was supersized to fit American tastes: not only did the producers puff up his backstage moment talking to his children by cellphone with the swelling refrain of ''You Raise Me Up,'' but they also kept the mawkish song rolling as David Hasselhoff and the other judges climbed the steps to a private jet, in slow motion, at sunset. 
 Even ''Reality Bites Back'' doesn't come close.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise at 2 Carriers, Despite $1 Billion in Losses

BYLINE: By ABHA BHATTARAI; A headline in an earlier version of this article misstated the size of Delta's loss. It is $1.04 billion, not $10.4 billion.

 BODY:
Two major airlines each reported quarterly losses of more than $1 billion on Wednesday, reflecting the industry's struggle to cope with higher jet fuel costs and an economic slowdown.
 But, helped by higher fares, charges for checked baggage and cutbacks in flights, the results topped Wall Street forecasts and their share prices surged.
 The losses were reported by AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines. Most of the losses were a result of large write-downs as they tried to deal with revamping costs before Labor Day, when travel typically drops off. 
 ''Both airlines are taking big write-offs because they're preparing to shrink this fall,'' said Bob McAdoo, an analyst for Avondale Partners. ''Traffic always drops after Labor Day but beyond that, you're also seeing that earnings are down because of the impact of fuel.''
 Shares of AMR rose 32 percent, or $1.41, to close at $5.82 a share. The stock of Delta rose 27 percent, or $1.24, to $5.91. 
 American Airlines, based in Fort Worth, reported a loss of $1.45 billion, or $5.77 a share, for its second quarter, compared with a profit of $317 million, or $1.08 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, American said its lost $284 million, or $1.13 a share. Revenue rose 5.1 percent, to $6.18 billion.
 Delta, based in Atlanta, reported a second-quarter loss of $1.04 billion, or $2.64 a share, compared with a profit of $1.59 billion in the quarter a year ago. 
 Much of the loss came as the result of one-time charges of $1.2 billion. Excluding those special charges, Delta said it had net income of $137 million or 35 cents a share compared with $274 million in the same quarter a year earlier. On that basis, analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expected a profit of 10 cents.
 Delta, which in April agreed to merge with Northwest, said its revenue rose 10 percent to $5.5 billion, from $5 billion a year earlier. 
 ''Even though Delta and American did a little bit better than we expected, we're still looking at big losses,'' Ray Neidl, an analyst for Calyon Securities, said, adding that airlines are still concerned about a fall off in travel after Labor Day.
 ''It was better than we thought -- quite a bit better,'' Michael Derchin, an analyst for FTN Midwest Securities, said of Delta.
 Mr. Derchin said the airline was helped by a ''pretty good'' fuel hedging program and by new fees they imposed for checked luggage.
 ''Nobody ever paid attention to other revenue up until now,'' Mr. Derchin said, adding that passenger fees brought in $170 million more than he had expected. ''That's one we haven't got a handle on yet,'' he said, ''so I think that line is going to be better for every airline.''
 Richard H. Anderson, the chief executive of Delta, said in a conference call that fuel prices had hurt the airline ''not only because of the magnitude of the change, but the pace of the change.''
 Delta said it hedged nearly half of its fuel consumption during the second quarter, leading to an average fuel price of $3.13 a gallon, a 50 percent increase from last year when it paid $2.09 a gallon.
 AMR said it paid $2.42 billion for fuel in the quarter, an average of $3.19 a gallon, up from $1.64 billion a year earlier.
 Delta said it expected to cut overall capacity in the second half of 2008 by 4 percent and domestic capacity by 13 percent, but the airline will increase international capacity by 14 percent. 
 Edward H. Bastian, the president of Delta, said there was ''some concern'' about domestic demand in the fall, and that the airline was willing to make additional cuts if necessary.
 ''The amount of capacity coming out of the domestic system is unprecedented,'' he said. ''You are seeing reductions along the magnitude of those seen post-9/11.''

HEADLINE: While the U.S. Spends Heavily on Health Care, a Study Faults the Quality

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
American medical care may be the most expensive in the world, but that does not mean it is worth every penny. A study to be released Thursday highlights the stark contrast between what the United States spends on its health system and the quality of care it delivers, especially when compared with many other industrialized nations. 
 The report, the second national scorecard from this influential health policy research group, shows that the United States spends more than twice as much on each person for health care as most other industrialized countries. But it has fallen to last place among those countries in preventing deaths through use of timely and effective medical care, according to the report by the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit research group in New York. 
 Access to care in the United States has worsened since the fund's first report card in 2006 as more people -- some 75 million -- are believed to lack adequate health insurance or are uninsured altogether. And within the nation, the report found, the cost and quality of care vary drastically. 
 The findings are likely to provide supporting evidence for the political notion that the nation's health care system needs to be fixed. Both presumptive presidential nominees, Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama, argue that the country needs to get more value for its health care money, even if they do not agree on what changes would be most effective. But few people these days defend the status quo.
 ''It's harder to keep deluding yourself or be complacent that we don't have areas that need improvement,'' said Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund. 
 The study, which assesses the United States on 37 health care measures, finds little improvement since the last report, as the cost of health care continues to rise steadily and more people -- even those with insurance -- struggle to pay their medical bills. 
 ''The central finding is that access has deteriorated,'' Ms. Davis said.
 Even some experts who are quick to point to some of the country's medical successes, as in reducing the deaths from heart disease or childhood cancers, for example, also acknowledge the need for change.
 ''We need to generate better value in this country,'' said Dr. Denis A. Cortese, the chief executive of the Mayo Clinic. 
 In some cases, the nation's progress was overshadowed by improvements in other industrialized countries, which typically have more centralized health systems, which makes it easier to put changes in place. 
 The United States, for example, has reduced the number of preventable deaths for people under the age of 75 to 110 deaths for every 100,000 people, compared with 115 deaths five years earlier, but other countries have made greater strides. As a result, the United States now ranks last in preventable mortality, just below Ireland and Portugal, according to the Commonwealth Fund's analysis of World Health Organization data. The leader by that measure is France, followed by Japan and Australia. 
 Other countries worked hard to improve, according to the Commonwealth Fund researchers. Britain, for example, focused on steps like improving the performance of individual hospitals that had been the least successful in treating heart disease. The success is related to ''really making a government priority to get top-quality care,'' Ms. Davis said.
 The presidential candidates both emphasize the need to shift the country's health priorities, to provide more medical care that helps prevent people from developing disease and that helps control conditions before they become expensive and hard to treat. And the mounting evidence indicates that such issues are not simply political talking points, said Len Nichols, a health economist at New America Foundation, a nonprofit group in Washington that advocates universal health care coverage. 
 More hospital executives and doctors understand their performance could be better, Mr. Nichols said.
 Dr. James J. Mongan, the chief executive of Partners HealthCare System, a big medical network in Boston, agrees that ''there's substantial room for improvement.'' Dr. Mongan is one of several health care leaders who is working with the Commonwealth Fund to develop a model for a better system. 
 Business leaders also see a pressing need for health care changes, said Helen Darling, the president of the National Business Group on Health, which represents big employers that provide medical benefits to their workers. The report ''documents that it's been as bad as we have been thinking it is,'' she said. 
 But Ms. Darling and others were also heartened because some areas in the report said that the United States had shown marked improvement, including the measurements hospitals use to track how well they treated conditions like heart failure and pneumonia. 
 ''It proves once again if you have quantitative information and metrics and make people pay attention, they change,'' Ms. Darling said. 
 But the report also emphasizes the inefficiencies of the American health care system. The administrative costs of the medical insurance system consume much more of the current health care dollar, about 7.5 percent, than in other countries. 
 Bringing those administrative costs down to the level of 5 percent or so as in Germany and Switzerland, where private insurers play a significant role, would save an estimated $50 billion a year in the United States, Ms. Davis said. 
 ''It kind of dwarfs everything else you can do,'' she said.
 Much of the high costs are attributed to the lack of computerized systems that may link pharmacies and doctors' offices for filling prescriptions, for example, or that may enable insurers to more efficiently pay doctors' bills. 
 ''An awful lot of the waste in this system is the antiquity of the information technology,'' Ms. Darling said. 
 Karen Ignagni, the chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, argues that much of the higher administrative costs stem from the additional services provided by United States insurers, like disease management programs, and the burdensome regulatory and compliance costs of doing business in 50 states. A more uniform system could result in savings, she said.

Serbia's government may reinstate ambassadors it recalled from countries that recognized an independent Kosovo, a policy shift that senior Serbian officials said Belgrade was considering to show its commitment to the West. 
 Serbia recalled ambassadors from several countries -- including France, Germany, Britain, Belgium, Italy and the United States -- to protest their decision to recognize Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in February. Serbia considers Kosovo its medieval heartland and has called its unilateral declaration of independence a reckless breach of international law.
 But Vuk Jeremic, Serbia's foreign minister, said in an interview here on Wednesday that his country's new pro-Western government was determined to mend ties with Europe and Washington, even if its opposition to Kosovo's independence remained as emphatic as ever. 
 He said the possibility of reinstating Serbia's ambassadors, which he planned to discuss over the weekend with President Boris Tadic, would potentially affect about 20 ambassadors. 
 ''The two foreign policy priorities of our new government are integrating Serbia into the European Union and continuing our diplomatic struggle to defend our sovereignty and preserve our territorial integrity,'' Mr. Jeremic said. He added that Serbia was prepared to engage with all parties, including Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders, to solve the impasse over Kosovo. 
 The pro-Western coalition government, which was formed last week, is the product of an unlikely union between Mr. Tadic's Democrats and the Socialist Party, once led by the strongman Slobodan Milosevic. While some Western diplomats and Serbian liberals have expressed alarm about the inclusion of the Socialists in the government, Mr. Jeremic, a leading Democrat, said he was convinced that the party was committed to taking Serbia into the European Union.
 He said the Democrats had also received assurances that the Socialists, the party that was at war with the West in the 1990s, would not stand in the way of the union's demands that Serbia hand over war-crimes suspects for trial in The Hague.
 ''The Socialists are no longer Milosevic's party -- Milosevic is dead,'' he said. ''The party joined with us to pursue European integration.'' 
 While Belgrade appeared to be moderating its tone on Kosovo, Mr. Jeremic made it clear that Serbia's policy of opposing Kosovo's independence had not changed. He said he had recently been engaged in diplomacy on several continents to lobby countries not to recognize what Serbia considered a false state. 
 So far, 43 of the United Nations' 192 members have recognized Kosovo, according to Kosovo's government. The newborn country received a significant lift last week when an international donors' conference in Brussels raised nearly $1.9 billion in aid. 
 Western diplomats have been hopeful that the new Serbian government's pro-European Union stance will temper the opposition to Kosovo's independence. Although Serbians remain upset over the West's support for Kosovo, analysts say economic concerns have since trumped emotions, with most Serbs indicating that prosperity is their priority. 
 Serbia is one of Europe's poorest nations, with many of its people earning about $500 a month.
