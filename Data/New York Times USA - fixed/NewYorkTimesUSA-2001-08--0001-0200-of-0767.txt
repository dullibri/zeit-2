HEADLINE: Spurned New Hires Have Their Say 

BYLINE:  By LAURA ROE STEVENS 

 BODY:
Wendy Withers had rented out her Los Angeles apartment, sold her furniture and her Nissan Xterra and said goodbye to her colleagues at TBWA/Chiat/Day. After three years as a full-time art buyer for the advertising agency, she said she had landed a long-term freelance job with a large Madison Avenue advertising agency, and she could hardly wait to begin.
 She had long wanted to work in Manhattan, the advertising capital of the world, she said, and on March 19, she received a contract that specified her salary, duties and starting date. Over the next few days, she said, she chatted on the telephone with her future supervisor, a friendly woman who suggested she take extra time to find an apartment in the city. 
 The first hint of trouble came on April 1. Ms. Withers was visiting her parents in Missouri on her way to the East Coast, and dialed her old work voice mail. Her new boss had left a message on it. "She said, 'I hope you haven't left L.A. yet for New York, because you might not be able to start work when we discussed,' " Ms. Withers recalled. "I couldn't believe it," she said.
She flew to New York the next day, but the manager did not return her calls. She kept trying on April 3 and finally reached her on the phone toward the end of the day. "She told me they couldn't hire me because of massive layoffs" that were in the works, Ms. Withers said.
It might seem unfair, but more companies these days are giving new hires the heave-ho before they even start. It is not poor planning, just bad luck, they tell the victims. Caught off guard by the economic downturn, companies have had to eliminate jobs, following the age-old principle of last hired, first fired.
There is nothing illegal about the practice, workplace experts say, unless the discharged employees can prove the company misled them. But that is becoming easier to do, as Ms. Withers found out, because courts are giving a more sympathetic ear to their tales of woe.
Ms. Withers reminded her supervisor that she had quit a good job on the assurance that the New York agency had an opening for her. She also asked if she could at least be compensated for the time and money she had spent to make the move, and was told to ask the human resources department.
"I knew that would be fruitless," she said. "I immediately called an attorney instead." After spending a few weeks unsuccessfully looking for another job in New York, she returned to Los Angeles to do freelance work with her old employer.
Her lawyer, Charles J. Harder in Los Angeles, meantime, quickly won a settlement of two months' pay from the New York agency. And if his client had not instructed him to limit the amount because she didn't want to "burn bridges," he said, he could have won a lot more.
That is because the New York company was legally guilty of fraud, he says, even if management was unfamiliar with her case. "The agency knew the economy was in shambles, and knew it had a hiring freeze in place, when it offered Wendy a long-term freelance position," he said. 
Ms. Withers spoke on the condition that the agency not be identified. Its outside counsel, Edward Hernstadt of Frankfurt, Garbus, Krunit, Klein & Selz in New York, declined to comment except to say that his client did all it could to find "a fair and equitable solution."
New employees who are dismissed had better think twice before taking legal action, though, Mr. Harder cautions, because if their case is not ironclad, they will be spinning their wheels.
He represented Load Media, an Internet entertainment start-up in Hollywood, which was sued by three former employees who had moved to Hollywood from Ohio to begin work there weeks before the steep downturn in the stock market in April 2000. Their complaint had no merit, he said, because Load Media had not deceived them.
Business was thriving when the company made the hires, he said, and it had no way of knowing of the impending market meltdown and subsequent collapse of talks with investors for a new infusion of cash. The former employees, who eventually dropped their suit, declined to comment.
The key to proving employment fraud is establishing that an employer misled a new hire with false statements, labor lawyers say, even if the person who made them believed them. In rare instances, plaintiffs can be entitled to punitive damages.
Allegations of hiring fraud can take convoluted turns because divining an employer's motivation is often impossible. For example, a new hire might be demoted rather than dismissed, making it more difficult to show wrongdoing.
That is what happened to a Connecticut native who moved to Los Angeles from New York in January to fill a financial position for Laundry by Shelli Segal, a designer of sportswear owned by Liz Claiborne Inc. When she arrived, the job was no longer available. Rather than be sent away, however, she was given a menial role, she says, and was fired after she complained. Several months later, she says, she won a sizable settlement.
The woman, citing a confidentiality clause in the settlement, spoke on the condition that neither her name nor the name of her lawyer be used. Roberta S. Karp, general counsel for Liz Claiborne, declined to comment.
California has some of the toughest laws protecting new hires, according to Baldwin J. Lee, chief employment litigator for Farella Braun & Martel in San Francisco. Over the last year, Mr. Lee says, he has represented six clients who moved to the state for jobs that fell through. He won a $1 million settlement for one of them. He says confidentiality agreements forbid him to disclose details. 
He based all his arguments, he said, on the 1996 California Supreme Court ruling in Andrew Lazar v. Rykoff-Sexton that a New Jersey company had induced a New York resident to relocate to Los Angeles by "falsely promising he would have a secure job."
"When you have an otherwise good breach-of-employment-contract case, a Lazar claim can be not just an arrow in your quiver," Mr. Lee said. "It can be a hammer you're holding behind your back."

HEADLINE: Two Camps At W.T.O. Said to Be A Bit Closer 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 31 

 BODY:
Eager to avoid repeating its humiliating failure in Seattle in 1999, the World Trade Organization moved today to rescue foundering negotiations on a new global round of trade talks by offering concessions to developing-country members.
 The 142-nation trade body has been holding a two-day meeting in an effort to assure that the November ministerial gathering in Doha, Qatar, where the new trade round is to be inaugurated, will go smoothly. Since the Seattle meeting fell apart, the large industrial economies have been at odds with many poorer countries, which say they got too little benefit from previous international trade pacts. 
 On Monday, Mike Moore, the head of the trade organization, told reporters gloomily that the trade group was on the edge of "irrelevance" without a new trade round. But the mood shifted today, as word filtered out of the meetings that the developing countries would be allowed more leeway in meeting the commitments they made in the last round of talks, known as the Uruguay Round. Those talks, completed in 1994, paved the way for the creation of the trade organization.
"I think we've seen some movement," Mr. Moore said today. "But there's a lot of work to be done."
Peter Carl, the European Union's director general for trade, said that "very substantial progress has been made towards the launch of a substantial, ambitious and very comprehensive round of global trade negotiations." The American representative at the talks also was upbeat.
The European Union gained backing from the Bush administration on Monday for its proposal that the issues of investment and competition policy be included in the new round of talks. The Europeans hope gains in that area will help offset painful trade-offs they may be obliged to make in Europe's generous agricultural subsidy system.
Details of the concessions offered to the developing countries today were sketchy, but appeared to include wording changes in existing agreements covering trade subsidies and customs valuation, delegates said. Arguments over how to carry out these and other past deals have been a significant stumbling block in preparing for the Doha meeting.
Poorer countries have insisted since the Seattle meeting that they need relief from some commitments they made in the Uruguay Round before new talks can start. Industrial countries say any changes to past agreements should be negotiated as part of the new round.
"There has been some evolution today," said Pakistan's lead trade negotiator, Munir Akram. Pakistan and India have been leading voices opposing a new round.
Feelings of having been shortchanged run deep among developing countries. On Monday, Tanzania's envoy, speaking on behalf of some 40 countries that met last week, said that while they did not reject a new round outright, the industrial countries must first open up their markets for textiles and agricultural goods, as the developing countries contend they were promised in the Uruguay Round. 
Agreement is essential because the World Trade Organization operates by consensus, and can ill afford another highly visible black eye like the failure of the Seattle meeting.
On Monday, Mr. Moore warned the poorer countries that they would be further marginalized without a new round of talks. On their own, he said, they do not have enough leverage to negotiate beneficial bilateral deals with large countries. 
The organization's members will meet again in late August to try to wrap up a considerable number of remaining agenda questions, including those involving agriculture, the environment and anti-dumping measures -- any one of which is a potential deal-breaker for Doha.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Declines As Japanese Try to Save More 

BYLINE:  By MIKI TANIKAWA 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 31 

 BODY:
Personal spending showed a steep decline in June as Japanese consumers set aside a larger share of their income in anticipation of tougher economic times. 
 And the unemployment rate in June, which was released today, remained at its highest level ever, 4.9 percent, adding to a stream of harrowing economic information that has been published recently. 
 The new data showed spending by households headed by salaried workers was 3.3 percent lower in June in real terms, compared with the same month last year. These households, which make up the bulk of Japanese consumers, spent 68.9 percent of their monthly disposable income and saved the rest. 
The saving-conscious Japanese generally put aside a much larger share of their income than Americans. But a spending rate of 68.9 percent is the lowest since the government began to compile statistics in the current format in 1975.
Monthly spending, which averaged 304,000 yen per household in June ($2,431), declined even as disposable income rose 1.9 percent for the year. 
Economists said the spending decrease was much more severe than had been anticipated. 
But the fall was so precipitous that some economists questioned the reliability of the data. 
"Samples are limited for the household spending survey, and there often are swings in survey results," Tetsuro Sugiura, chief economist at Fuji Research Institute in Tokyo, said.
The government received data from 4,514 households for the survey. Mr. Sugiura pointed out that other reports for car sales, travel service revenues and department store sales, which are more dependable, showed an increase in the spring. 
Nevertheless, he said, "It is clear that consumption has been slowing." 
In another sign of the reluctance of consumers to spend, only 560,000 new housing starts were recorded in the first six months, 6.1 percent fewer than in the same period in 2000 and the lowest total since the mid-1980's.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Independent film producers are turning to new kinds of outdoor promotions to fill theaters.

BYLINE:  By Bernard Stamler 

 BODY:
ADVERTISING may be in a slump these days as people who buy time and space grow more conservative in a sluggish economy, but not everyone is playing it safe. In some industries, people are using advertising in ways they never did before.
 One of those industries is the independent film business, where producers, constrained by a lack of promotional dollars, have traditionally marketed their offbeat, low-budget fare in inexpensive ways. 
 Except for advertising in the movie listing pages of big city newspapers -- they have little choice but to use this relatively costly medium to attract filmgoers -- most have historically limited their promotional efforts to "wild posting," or attaching movie posters to the sides of derelict buildings and urban construction sites. 
That is no longer the case. Most independent film companies now have World Wide Web sites, which are cheap to create and maintain. And while the wild posting continues, producers are turning to other kinds of outdoor advertising, too.
For example, to promote "Amores Perros," a Spanish-language film from Mexico that was nominated this year for an Academy Award, Lion's Gate Films put ads last spring in bus shelters and on billboards in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago, in neighborhoods with large Mexican populations.
Later this month, a modern, teenage version of Othello called "O" will be advertised on buses, bus shelters and billboards in those same cities and in New York.
In October, Lion's Gate will add subway ads to the mix for "The Wash," featuring the rap stars Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Eminem. That film will also be advertised outdoors in Detroit, Philadelphia and Washington, cities with a high concentration of the young black adults who are the movie's target audience, said Tom Ortenberg, the president of Lion's Gate.
"We will devote about 7 percent of the media budget for 'The Wash' to outdoor ads," he said. The marketing expenditures for "Amores Perros" were about $2 million, and those for "O" and "The Wash" will be "significantly higher," Mr. Ortenberg said.
Those numbers put Lion's Gate "on the high side" when it comes to media spending among the independents, he said, although they do not come close to the promotion and advertising budgets of big studio films. Those average about $25 million a movie and are much higher for potential blockbusters.
Promotional budgets for independent films can be $200,000 or even less, said Bob Berney, senior vice president for marketing and distribution for IFC Films in New York, the distribution wing of the Independent Film Channel. In addition to wild posting, his company recently promoted "Jump Tomorrow," a romantic comedy, by putting ads on telephone kiosks.
Possibly the biggest outdoor gamble by an independent studio to date is scheduled to take shape today, high above the Long Island Expressway, just east of the Midtown Tunnel toll booths in Queens. That is where Lot 47 Films will put up a billboard for "L.I.E.," a film named for the highway and shot on Long Island.
The work won high praise this year at the Sundance Film Festival and at the New Directors/New Films series sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art. The billboard depicts one of the film's principals, a teenage boy, lying on a highway overpass. The sign speaks of highways going east, west and sometimes "straight to hell."
Jeff Lipsky, a co-president of Lot 47, said "L.I.E." was "the first independent film ever to buy a billboard" on the expressway, which is "not exactly Sunset Boulevard," in Los Angeles where movie studios routinely run outdoor advertising. Nor is the highway in the kind of ethnic neighborhood where other independent films have recently been advertised.
Nevertheless, Lot 47 will spend $60,000 over two months to advertise the film on the expressway. That is nearly one-tenth of the film's national promotion budget, which Mr. Lipsky put at $600,000 to $800,000. It represents a lot of advertising eggs in one basket.
Moreover, the film also deals with touchy subjects like pedophilia, and its content has earned "L.I.E." an NC-17 rating, which means no one younger than 17 can be admitted.
Most studios, especially the major ones, try to avoid such a designation at any cost. But Mr. Lipsky is sanguine about the chances of "L.I.E." He thinks moviegoers are increasingly sophisticated, and not just the urban stalwarts who usually support independent films.
Besides, there is the element of local interest. That's why "L.I.E." is being advertised to Long Island commuters and why it will open in early September in Manhattan and in several Long Island towns before it is released nationally.
But will the billboard, with its catch phrase about hell, really deliver an audience?
"I think so," said Mr. Lipsky, whose company will conduct informal polling at theaters where the film is shown to determine whether viewers saw the outdoor sign.
"There have to be better ways of doing independent film advertising than just wild posting and spending a bunch of money in The New York Times," he said.

HEADLINE: Management: Vigilance In the Face Of Layoff Rage; 
Employer Miscues Can Breed Retaliation

BYLINE:  By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU 

 BODY:
Juval Aviv, a private investigator in New York, had lunch in April with a man he suspected of sabotaging one of his client's computer systems, causing up to $20 million in damage and indefinitely delaying a long-planned public stock offering.
 Mr. Aviv, whose client was a New Jersey chemical company, told the man, the company's former manager of information-management systems, that all the evidence pointed to him and that he was there to help him make things right. After a few hours and many cups of coffee, the 56-year-old former employee, whose name Mr. Aviv would not disclose to protect the identity of the company, confessed his guilt. 
 The man was one of 50 people laid off from the company in February, and he had known another executive's computer password and had used it after he lost his job to tap into the company's computer system from home and delete critical inventory and personnel files, Mr. Aviv said. 
What caused this company veteran, who had been making $186,000 a year and who had a wife and three children, to crack? An anonymous note that he wrote to the president of the concern before he was caught sheds some light on his motive. "I have been loyal to the company in good and bad times for over 30 years," he wrote. "I was expecting a member of top management to come down from his ivory tower to face us with the layoff announcement, rather than sending the kitchen supervisor with guards to escort us off the premises like criminals. You will pay for your senseless behavior."
As the economy continues to stagnate and layoffs proliferate, workplace experts say, it is becoming more important than ever for employers to display vigilance against possible retaliation by the people they are letting go.
For one thing, workers seem to be angrier these days when the ax falls, said Beverly Smallwood, a Mississippi psychologist who does workplace consulting for businesses. Many workers have put in endless hours and sweat for the promise of hefty stock options that never materialized.
"I don't recall at any time in my history, and I've been in this for 30 years, where the degree of destruction was quite as high," said Linn A. Hynds, a Detroit employment lawyer. Since December, he has advised companies in 10 factory and office closings and layoffs involving 1,500 workers in southeastern Michigan.
At the same time, the people doing the dismissals at many companies -- especially dot-coms -- are younger and more inexperienced than their predecessors in the last big layoff binge of the early 1990's. In their overzealousness, some of them make the mistake of bringing in security guards in inappropriate settings, increasing the victims' resentment and making retribution more likely.
The New Jersey chemical company committed two classic faux pas in handing out its pink slips, in the view of Mr. Aviv, who is president and chief executive of Interfor Inc., a private investigation firm. First, it was unduly harsh toward a high-level executive who was accustomed to being coddled and who was familiar with the ins and outs of its computer network. And second, it failed to maintain a backup filing system to protect its crucial documents against sabotage.
The worker was arrested and is out on bail, but may avoid jail time, he said, because the company does not want to look stupid and is considering settling the case to hush up the matter.
Two of the most common acts of revenge are theft of company property and breaches in the company's computer network, according to an annual survey of Fortune 1000 companies by Pinkerton Inc., the Chicago security firm. Ray O'Hara, Pinkerton's vice president for the Western region, estimates that employee retaliation occurs in only 1 percent of dismissals, but could be as high as 5 percent at companies that do not handle layoffs well or that have a hostile corporate culture.
The electronic workplace, while making businesses more productive, has also created a situation that enables employees to bring a company to its knees with just a few keystrokes.
That reality was brought home five years ago when Timothy A. Lloyd, a computer programmer, was accused of hiding a software "time bomb" to delete critical files in his company's computer system after being fired. The case, which is still making its way through the courts, involved Omega Engineering Inc., a temperature components maker in Bridgeport, N.J., which asserts that the damage could eventually cost it $10 million in sales and contracts. Mr. Lloyd has denied any wrongdoing.
Moreover, with the growth in telecommuting and the spread of Internet-capable hand-held devices, it has become easier for dismissed workers to wreak havoc outside the company premises. Companies are also beginning to install wireless networks in offices and factories that go through walls and have a range of 300 feet. That means employees can potentially tap into company databases via a laptop computer from right outside their former workplaces.
As a result, security experts suggest cutting off employees' connections to the corporate networks before letting the employees go.
"Every new wave of technology introduces new security exposures," said Richard Hunter, managing vice president at Gartner Inc., a research firm. "Clamp down and take away pass codes," he advised. "If people who have a reason to be upset have access to your system, then they have the means. The remaining question is: Do they have the motivation?"
A disgruntled employee at an East Coast service company certainly did, according to Jay Ehrenreich, a senior manager for the cybercrime unit of PricewaterhouseCoopers in New York. The employee figured out how to alter product prices on the company's Web site and fouled up a month of bills, Mr. Ehrenreich said.
The sabotage, which occurred during a company reorganization and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage, was never linked to a specific employee because the process for assigning identification numbers for access to the network was so "messed up" the worker was able to obtain a bunch of ID's and hide his or her identity, he said. The company called in Mr. Ehrenreich to fix the problem.
Even if they are cut off from the company's computers, disgruntled workers have found that the Internet makes it easy to take their frustration out by spreading false information in chat rooms or sending out fake news releases. And they can always engage in the low-tech practice of just bad-mouthing their former employer -- and there is not much a company can do about that.
Amazon.com tried to convince 1,300 of the workers it laid off this year to sign an agreement that included a clause to not disparage the company in return for more lucrative severance deals, but backed off from enforcing the clause under pressure from union organizers and also fear of a public reaction.
Old-fashioned theft also remains a staple of worker retaliation. The average company loses approximately 6 percent of its gross revenue to employee fraud and abuse, according to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners in Austin, Tex.
"We classify it as ex-rage," said Daniel D. Thaxton, manager for document security at Standard Register, a maker of business forms in Dayton, Ohio. One common blunder is to leave open boxes of company checks in unsecured rooms, he said.
But with computers infiltrating every corner of businesses today, from the head offices to the manufacturing floor, even blue-collar workers are potential cybersaboteurs, Mr. Thaxton says. For example, he says, an angry assembly line worker can now sabotage a computer system, bringing down an entire line.
"While some people on the floor are much more likely to take a hammer to a piece of machinery, we have had people reprogram systems and mess the manufacturing processes up," he said. "Most of the cases we have seen involved robotic equipment, such as a robotic arm."
Often it takes two to three days to figure out what is wrong with such a system, Mr. Thaxton said, and in the age of just-in-time manufacturing, that can mean the loss of contracts.
In another example of employee mischief, Mr. Hynds, the Detroit lawyer, says he knows of several cases in which fired workers have stuffed their office computer in the cardboard box they are given for personal belongings and have tried to walk out with it.
Sometimes, they were merely trying to protect their private files, not steal company secrets, he says, as in the case of a married company vice president who tried to spirit out his computer because it contained love letters to and from his girlfriend. But the fact remains that former employees can end up with valuable company information at their disposal. To avoid that, he suggests letting dismissed workers download or erase personal files under strict company supervision.
It is not just the laid-off workers who pose a threat. Employees who survive a layoff can also vandalize company property to avenge their departed co-workers.
Arthur May, operations manager at the Kimberly-Clark mill in Hendersonville, N.C., recalled a time at another paper plant that a wrench jammed a machine and shut it down. "When people feel they've been dealt with unfairly, 'ghost' things just start to happen," he said.
To be sure, most employees are honest and tales of sour-grapes subversion can be overblown. Jonathan L. Alpert, a labor lawyer in Tampa, Fla., who represents workers, said dismissed employees could be easy scapegoats to blame for run-of-the-mill computer problems or even management missteps.
Most dismissed workers "are shell-shocked," Mr. Alpert said.
"Their main concern," he added, "is figuring out how to get their lives together, not masterminding some sort of retaliation."

HEADLINE: Consumers Splurge but Confidence Wanes 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
American consumers increased their spending in June, especially on expensive items like cars and refrigerators, but their confidence about the economy over the next few months has recently deteriorated, raising questions about whether such spending can continue at its current pace.
 The latest data come from two economic reports issued yesterday, leaving economists divided as to whether consumers, who have helped keep the economy afloat through a sharp downturn in business investment, will continue to maintain their spending. 
 Some fear that the latest round of high-profile job cuts will undermine consumers' confidence, causing them to spend more cautiously. Other economists argue that declining energy prices, the coming tax rebates and the effect of lower interest rates are about to ease the overall downturn, negating the impact of recent job cuts. 
"Consumer spending really has decelerated, yet it's still moving forward," said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis. "That's really heartening because employment has stalled."
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index, which is based on a monthly survey of Americans aimed at eliciting their views of their own finances and expectations for the overall economy, fell to 116.5 in July from 118.9 in June. The June figure had been revised higher, and economists were expecting a reading of about 118 for July. It was the first decline since April, but the index remains above its recent low of 109.2 in February, when it reached the lowest mark since 1996.
Consumer spending, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent in June, the Commerce Department reported, surpassing the consensus of economists' expectations of 0.3 percent, which would have matched the increase in May. The increase included a 1.5 percent rise in spending on durable goods, expensive things like household appliances that can require financing and, sometimes, arguments.
Adjusted for price changes, Americans spent 1.6 percent more on durable goods in June than they did in May, and 7 percent more than in June 2000. Overall spending rose an inflation-adjusted 0.2 percent in June from the month before and 3.1 percent over a year earlier. 
The sharp jump in spending on durable goods could be caused by car dealers and department stores offering steep promotional discounts, said John Youngdahl, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "It raises a question of whether, in doing so, they are borrowing against their future sales," he said.
Personal income rose 0.3 percent, also exceeding by one-tenth of one percentage point the prior month's increase and the expectations of economists.
A separate report from the National Association of Purchasing Management in Chicago showed a sharp decline in manufacturing in the Midwest. The trade group said its monthly index fell to 38 in July, the lowest reading since March, from 44.4 in June.
The Labor Department plans to report on the unemployment rate for July on Friday, and economists expect the rate will rise to 4.7 percent from 4.5 percent in June. It has climbed from 4 percent at the end of last year.
The more the July unemployment report shows that "the breadth of weakness in the employment market has spread outside the manufacturing sector," Mr. Youngdahl said, "the greater the danger that consumers lose confidence and lose their propensity to spend."
Of all the new data, the consumer confidence report offered the most up-to-date assessment, and it showed that Americans' perceptions of the current economic situation were declining far faster than their hopes for the next six months or so. The index measuring how consumers feel about their present situation fell 3 percent, to 152, from 156.8, while the index of future expectations fell 0.6 percent, to 92.9, from 93.5.
"I'm not at all surprised that people are miserable as sin right now; you've got a little industry of doom," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. "Companies want low interest rates, and it's in their best interest to talk down expectations."
But, he added, "big, headline-grabbing layoffs are not a leading indicator of the economy."

HEADLINE: The Low Cost of Lowering Auto Emissions 

BYLINE:  By Dianne Feinstein and Olympia Snowe; Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, are members of the United States Senate.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Requiring sport utility vehicles and other light trucks to go farther on a gallon of gas is the most effective step America could take both to limit dependence on foreign oil and to slow global warming, yet for years Congress has not taken it. The report issued yesterday by the National Academy of Sciences, asserting that this improvement is not only environmentally critical but technically feasible, gives solid support to those of us in Congress who have long wanted to set the same fuel efficiency standards for S.U.V.'s and light trucks that we now set for cars.
 Even before the report, the tide seemed to be turning on this issue. In recent weeks, automakers said they wouldn't actively fight an effort to raise fuel efficiency standards; Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott said he would consider supporting the idea; and the Bush administration signaled approval, asking for authority to act on this issue. Polls show that Americans support improved fuel efficiency by wide margins. 
 The academy's report makes clear that increasing fuel economy could decrease the buildup of greenhouse gases without making American workers less competitive. And it suggests that we could actually improve highway safety by raising the fuel economy of the S.U.V.'s and light trucks. We believe that if S.U.V.'s were made lighter, they would become less dangerous to car passengers in collisions.
We propose phasing in the higher standards, reaching 27.5 miles per gallon -- the current standard for cars -- over six years. When fully phased in, the improvements would save one million barrels of oil per day, reduce annual oil imports by 10 percent and prevent 240 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each year.
Today, the average fuel economy of our nation's vehicles, at 24 miles a gallon, is the lowest it has been in 21 years. Efficiency dropped because when federal fuel economy standards were first instituted in 1975, light-duty trucks, then used mainly for towing and hauling, were exempted from the standards for cars. Back then, these vehicles were relatively few, but with both pickups and S.U.V.'s, which are a form of light truck, being used today in place of cars, roughly half of all new vehicles sold in the United States are now light trucks. They average 6.8 fewer miles to the gallon than do cars.
Automakers recently said they would increase the fuel economy of these trucks and S.U.V.'s by 25 percent by 2005. Yet in Europe they have pledged to go further, reducing fuel use by 25 percent for all vehicles, including cars. If automakers can produce greater fuel efficiency across the Atlantic, why can't they do it here?
The Union of Concerned Scientists said last month that with existing technology, automakers could produce vehicles averaging 40 miles a gallon by 2012 without sacrificing performance or safety. While that's an admirable goal, our proposal is more realistic over the next few years.
Consumers have an obvious interest in this legislation. If the standards we recommend are adopted, the average S.U.V. owner, driving the average number of miles, will save over $300 a year when gasoline is $1.50 a gallon and $400 a year if the price hits $2.
With 4 percent of the world's population, the United States today uses 25 percent of the planet's energy. Both to help ourselves and to take a leadership role on reducing greenhouse gases, we should follow up on the academy's report by closing the S.U.V. loophole now.

HEADLINE: Find Your Inner Wastrel 

BYLINE:  By Ben Stein; Ben Stein is the host of "Win Ben Stein's Money" on Comedy Central.

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. 

 BODY:
I want to be honest about this, but I also want to be modest, and that's difficult. Well, here goes. I, the same guy who is scared to death of needles and loud noises and rap music, am a hero of the recession, or rather, of the "economic slowdown." 
 Let me start back in Silver Spring, Md., where I grew up in a leafy neighborhood right after World War II. There, I was always the odd man (or little boy) out. My parents, like our neighbors, were hard-working, thrifty, careful people. But I was a spendthrift. Always. From Day One. The other boys would get the 10-cent regular popcorn from a machine with a light bulb in it. I would spend a quarter to get the buttered popcorn. The other kids would be happy with a 35-cent cheeseburger. I would get the 55-cent triple-decker Mighty Mo. You see how it was. My parents preached at me. They explained how my extravagance would lead to ruin for me and for the country. It didn't take. 
 When I got to college, the other kids had pea jackets. I had a camel's hair coat. They lived in tiny dorm rooms in Morningside Heights. I lived in an apartment with a river view. Even my girlfriend told me how foolishly extravagant I was, but I couldn't stop myself. My roommates had penny loafers. I had custom-made English ones. The president of my fraternity scornfully told me I was the most wasteful man he had ever known. I hung my head but kept on spending.
Once or twice, I would get a beam of hope that maybe I was not the total disgrace I was told I was. In the 1958 recession, Ike told Americans to go out and buy something, and I did -- a 45 record of "All Shook Up" and a tiny 45 r.p.m. box record player to play it on -- but all I got was more criticism.
Luckily for me, I married a woman who was just as extravagant as I was. She did not even look at a price tag. She never knew menus had numbers on the right side of the page. But as I earned more and spent much more, I got to feeling more and more guilty. What was wrong with me? Why couldn't I live within my means like decent people? Why couldn't I help the economy by boosting America's personal savings rate? I could not look at my monthly checking statement or my credit card bills without feeling humiliation, as if I were a saboteur of thenational interest.
But now, in the fullness of middle age, salvation and epiphany have reached me. It turns out the nation needs financial daredevils like me. The economy is in trouble. It was looted unimaginably by the dot-com mania (maybe self-looted), buffeted by the collapse of the Nasdaq, squeezed by a fall in world trade. And what is keeping it afloat? What is saving us from a total economic debacle? The consumer. And specifically, if I am to believe Alan Greenspan, the consumer who keeps right on consuming even when his credit cards are maxed out, he's up all night worrying about money ("I never worry about money," says my wife. "You worry enough for both of us"), and he sees nothing but gloom and doom in the newspapers.
That's me, friends -- spendthrift, wastrel, hero.

HEADLINE: CVS Reports 6% Rise in 2nd-Quarter Profit 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., July 31 

 BODY:
The CVS Corporation, the retail pharmacy chain, said today that its second-quarter earnings climbed 6 percent from a year ago, meeting Wall Street analysts' expectations that were revised last month after CVS warned of lower profits because of sluggish sales. 
 CVS, the nation's second-largest drugstore operator after the Walgreen Company, said that it earned $198 million, or 48 cents a share, for the period ended June 30. That compared with $186.5 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales for the quarter were $5.5 billion, up from $4.9 billion. 
 CVS, which is based in Woonsocket, R.I., warned last month that profit for the second quarter and the year would be lower than expected because the economic slowdown had affected high-margin seasonal and general merchandise categories. 
Today, the company gave another reason, saying that pharmaceutical sales had slowed because the company had to cut back hours or close its pharmacies at stores in the metropolitan areas of Cleveland, Detroit, Hartford and Washington because it did not have enough pharmacists.
Thomas M. Ryan, the chairman, said the company lost customers because of the shortage of pharmacists nationwide but did not say how many customers left. CVS hopes to attract an undisclosed number of them back by mailing them coupons worth $15 to $20 on nonpharmaceutical purchases, he said. 
The chain had 600 pharmacist vacancies as of the beginning of the year, said a spokesman, Todd Andrews. It hopes to reduce those to 150 by September, he added.
Mark Husson, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said CVS was in the same boat as other drugstore chains in controlling rising costs related to a scarcity of pharmacists. Investors will hold off buying company stock this quarter, Mr. Husson said, as they gauge CVS's success in recruiting pharmacists and await how the company rebounds from its sluggish prior quarter.

Mixed Data on Economy Give Dow an Early Rally

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as investors took heart from economic data showing unexpected strength in consumer spending. But the rally faded somewhat in the afternoon, and some analysts questioned how sustainable yesterday's gains would be.
 "People are very skittish," said Jon B. Brorson, director of equities at Northern Trust in Chicago. "Even though they put money to work, there was not a great deal of conviction. We're very tenuous, too." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 121.09 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 10,522.81. The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index rose 9.29 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,027.13. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.71 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,211.23.
The stock market surged after the Commerce Department reported that personal spending rose 0.4 percent in June, as personal income increased 0.3 percent. Analysts had expected income to rise 0.2 percent and consumer spending to be up 0.3 percent.
Reinforcing that report, chain store sales rose 1.6 percent during the first three retail weeks of July, according to Instinet Research's Redbook Retail Sales Average. Analysts had predicted that sales would rise 1.5 percent.
But reflecting the market's tentative mood, investors also bought on the day's weaker economic reports, and their promise of further interest rate cuts. The Conference Board said its monthly index of consumer confidence fell to 116.5 in July from 118.9 in June. In addition, the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its index showed a sharp decline in Midwestern manufacturing in July.
"That weaker economic data showed that inflation was in check and it left the door open for Greenspan to cut rates a couple more times," said Patrick Boyle, head financial trader at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Investors have been waiting for a reason to buy in this market, and they're not being very choosy in what they're buying."
Among the Dow's leaders were Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which rose $2.63, to $111.88; Caterpillar, which gained $1.55, to $55.10; and Philip Morris, which increased $1.83, to $45.50. Boeing was up $1.13, to $58.53.
Pharmaceutical issues showed strength as well, as investors once again viewed the sector as a safe haven. Merck gained $1.73, to $67.98; Johnson & Johnson rose $1.18, to $54.10; Bristol-Myers Squibb jumped $2.13, to $59.14; and Pfizer increased $1.12, to $41.22. Biotechnology companies were also notable gainers yesterday. Biogen was up $2.79, to $56.69, and Amgen rose $2.24, to $62.71. 
Among the stocks leading the Nasdaq higher, Ciena climbed $1.86, to $33.14; Sun Microsystems gained 77 cents, to $16.29; and Intel rose 77 cents, to $29.81.
Verizon Communications dropped $1.87, to $54.15, after it posted a second-quarter net loss of $1 billion, or 38 cents a share.
Shares of Motorola fell 34 cents, to $18.69, after it said it expected third-quarter revenue to rise about 5 percent from $7.5 billion in the second quarter. Robert Growney, the president and chief operating officer, said he expected fourth-quarter revenue to be 5 percent greater than in the third quarter. He also projected a slight fourth-quarter profit. --------------------

Treasury Prices Gain
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday as declines in manufacturing and consumer confidence buoyed expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 10/32, to a price of 99 19/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.05 percent from 5.10 percent on Monday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/32, to 97 28/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.52 percent from 5.53 percent on Monday.

Priceline.com Posts a Profit On Sharp Increase in Sales

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Priceline.com, the name-your-own-price Internet travel service that six months ago was reeling from unhappy customers, has reached a milestone that few other Internet companies have passed: it made a profit according to generally accepted accounting principles.
 Priceline's revival was driven by a sharp and unexpected increase in sales. In the second quarter, its sales were $364.8 million, the company said yesterday, well above analysts' estimates of $301 million. 
 Priceline's sales reached a previous peak of $352 million in the second quarter of 2000 but fell to $228 million in the fourth quarter of last year, as customer complaints and the failure of some of its ventures outside of travel sullied the company's image. 
"They were on life support nine months ago and the priest was summoned," said Henry Blodget, a Merrill Lynch analyst. "Now they are training for a marathon."
Like most Internet companies, Priceline practices name-your-own-accounting-rules and prefers its custom definition of "pro forma" profits. By that measure, Priceline, which is based in Norwalk, Conn., earned $11.7 million, or 5 cents a share. That is more than the 1.5 cents a share that analysts had expected. The pro forma figures exclude charges for stock option grants and $5.4 million for severance payments to Daniel H. Schulman, the former chief executive who left in May.
By generally accepted accounting principles, or G.A.A.P., Priceline earned $2.8 million, or a penny a share, in contrast to a loss of $11.7 million a year earlier. By this measure, used by most other non-Internet companies, the only major Internet company that is profitable has been eBay, the online auction house. Yahoo was profitable in 1999 and 2000, but it has turned to a loss, by all measures, as Internet advertising has declined.
Travel has been the one bright spot on the Internet as online advertising and other sorts of online shopping contract. The two large full-service travel agencies, Travelocity and Expedia, have been growing briskly and have posted profits by their pro forma measures but not on a G.A.A.P. basis.
Priceline has also benefited from substantial cost-cutting. Its expenses, pro forma, fell 16 percent from a year earlier, to $50.2 million. The biggest cuts came in its general and administrative expenses, which fell by half, to $7.5 million. Its advertising expense fell only 1 percent, to $13.7 million. (Priceline has moved away from its longtime spokesman, William Shatner. Its new advertisements feature celebrities like Quentin Tarantino, Tony Randall and Billy Idol.)
"When we got in trouble, we became very disciplined about our turnaround plan," said Richard S. Braddock, the company's chief executive.
Priceline's cash balances increased to $165.7 million from $142.6 million at the end of the first quarter.
"It wasn't two quarters ago that people were saying we would be running out of cash," Mr. Braddock said. "Now we think we will be cash-flow positive going forward."
With business travel slowing as a result of the economic downturn, airlines have responded by sharply cutting fares. This creates a double-edged sword for Priceline. On the one hand, airlines give it additional tickets to resell. But on the other, they offer more discount fares on their own Web sites and through other outlets.
As a result, Priceline was able to fulfill 57 percent of the bids placed by customers, up from its typical 50 percent. But the average value of its transactions, including airline tickets, hotel rooms and car rentals, decreased to $248 in the quarter from $266 in the first quarter.
"They are getting a benefit from the weak economy on both the supply and the demand side," said Mark Rowen, a Prudential Securities analyst. 
Priceline will still not reveal the airline or flights until after a customer bids for a ticket and enters a credit card number. But it has moved to increase disclosure and reduce the unappealing routings that have previously offended customers. 
"They aren't giving people four-hour layovers anymore, so people don't feel like they've been swindled into owning a ticket they didn't want," Mr. Blodget said.
Even so, Priceline's fastest growth has been in hotels and car rentals, where its restrictions are not as great. Mr. Braddock said that the company's biggest success had been selling additional tickets to its existing base of 11 million customers, mainly through e-mail messages.
"Our brand has recovered a lot faster than we anticipated," Mr. Braddock said.
Priceline's shares, already up yesterday, gained 78 cents, to $9.65 in after-hours trading, after the release of its results.

HEADLINE: Hevesi Faults Vallone for Saying He'd Cut Police or Schools Before Parks 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi said yesterday that one of his rivals for the Democratic mayoral nomination, City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, was making an "error of the first order" by ruling out future budget cuts for the Parks Department but not for the Police Department or the Board of Education.
 In response, Mr. Vallone's campaign workers accused Mr. Hevesi of making a series of budget miscalculations as comptroller and suggested that he had improperly tried to use city pension funds to invest in a fund controlled by one of his political donors. 
 The exchange yesterday may reflect the belief of the Hevesi and Vallone campaign staffs that the two candidates are competing for many of the same voters -- moderate Democrats and residents of Queens, where both men live and have had long political careers. 
Mr. Hevesi's assertion that Mr. Vallone had shown misplaced priorities was prompted by Mr. Vallone's statement in an interview published in The New York Times yesterday that he would exempt the Parks Department from budget cuts in the event of an economic downturn but not the Police Department or the schools. 
"Parks are important, and they have been underfunded," Mr. Hevesi said in a news conference at City Hall Park. "But the reality is, for me, that the highest priority of service that the city can provide right now is reform of the public schools and sustaining the fight against crime. And so, for me, saying that you are willing to cut the budgets of the Board of Education -- which, incidentally, the Council has done in the last budget -- and the Police Department, I think is public policy error of the first order."
Mr. Vallone's campaign workers responded by accusing Mr. Hevesi of inaccurate economic forecasts as city comptroller. "In making this latest, desperate attack, it seems that Mr. Hevesi is trying to compensate for his own track record of grave budget miscalculations, which would have forced the city to cut thousands of cops, firefighters, and teachers," said Mattis Goldman, Mr. Vallone's press secretary. "Unlike Mr. Hevesi, Peter Vallone knows how to manage a budget."
Noting that the stated purpose of Mr. Hevesi's news conference had been to propose lobbying reforms, Mr. Vallone's campaign workers renewed questions about Mr. Hevesi's connection to efforts to invest city pension money in a fund controlled by a company that had contributed to his campaign. 
Assistants to Mr. Hevesi said he had supported investing in the fund, FdG Capital Partners, only after it was recommended by the independent consulting firm that advises the city on pension fund investments. The assistants said the fund had done well, and they noted that the the real estate family that runs the fund, the Fishers, had also contributed to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's campaigns.
As the two campaigns squabbled, the two other major candidates seeking the Democratic nomination held more peaceable events. Public Advocate Mark Green was endorsed by the Service Employees International Union, Local 32B-32J, which represents building maintenance workers throughout the city. Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, held a news conference at City Hall with several candidates for City Council to press his proposal for passing a city law banning racial profiling. 
Mr. Ferrer's campaign assistants said yesterday that he would begin his television advertisement campaign in the next two days, starting with an advertisement on Spanish-language television stations, followed by one that included H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, and Geraldine Ferraro, the former Queens representative, speaking favorably about Mr. Ferrer's record in rebuilding the Bronx.
For Mr. Vallone and Mr. Hevesi, the day's exchanges reflected a recent increase in hostilities between their camps. Mr. Vallone has suggested that Mr. Hevesi is trying to circumvent the city's campaign finance laws, which limit spending, by running his campaign from the office of his political consultant, Hank Morris, instead of renting his own space. (Mr. Hevesi has said that he is simply being frugal, and that the arrangement is legal.)
And Mr. Hevesi has attacked Mr. Vallone for spending $2 million in taxpayer money to promote himself with mailings and brochures from the Council. (Mr. Vallone has said that the mailings are all for official Council business.)
For all their disagreement, Mr. Vallone and Mr. Hevesi were cordial last night when they appeared at a candidates' forum on parks and recreational services in Downtown Manhattan. They sat next to each other and playfully patted each other on the back. Mr. Vallone said he would commit 1 percent of the budget for parks, and Mr. Hevesi said he would increase the money for parks but he would not make a commitment to a specific percentage.

Food for Thought? In Many Cases, No

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein 

 BODY:
WHAT is the most efficient way to raise low-income pupils' achievement? Is it ending social promotion, increasing accountability or adding more testing?
 It could be none of those. Improving nutrition might bring a bigger test-score gain. 
 Hunger is not as serious here as in countries where children are so nutrient-deprived that brain growth is impeded. The moderate undernutrition found in the United States affects performance, but recovery is usually possible with adequate diet. Yet if dietary deficiencies persist, learning can suffer. Iron deficiency anemia, which is twice as common in poor as in better-off children, affects cognitive ability. In experiments where pupils got inexpensive vitamin and mineral supplements, test scores rose from that treatment alone. 
In another experiment, poor children who got free breakfast at school were compared with children who were eligible but who did not participate. Those with breakfast gained about three percentile points on standardized tests, and attendance also improved, at a price of only about a dollar a day per child. That is more than most education reforms can accomplish at the cost. 
One in six children now comes from a family in poverty. With rents rising faster than inflation, the poor reduce food purchases. Deteriorating nutrition may have undercut efforts to improve school performance.
Welfare-to-work policies seemed to make sense as a way to push poor parents to take more responsibility for supporting their children, but have not done much to ease child hunger. Many former welfare recipients are now employed in jobs paying the minimum wage, or close to it, earnings that have not given them the ability to nourish their children: a full-time minimum-wage worker is paid only about $11,000 a year, and a family of four is below the poverty line if earnings are less than about $17,000.
Meanwhile, food stamp use has fallen, partly because many welfare-to-work participants wrongly think they are now ineligible. Although the working poor qualify, public agencies have failed to promote enrollment. In 1994, 86 percent of eligible children were in families getting stamps; by 1998, the figure was 69 percent. 
After ensuring that poor families get food stamps to which they are entitled, officials should set another priority: expanding the school breakfast program. 
Eligibility for breakfast is the same as for the better-known federal lunch program: children whose parents have income below 130 percent of the poverty line get free meals; if income is below 185 percent, meals are subsidized. But participation in school breakfast is much lower than in lunch.
Part of the reason is that school officials hesitate to take on yet another duty, and even with the best of intentions, breakfast programs are hard to organize. Arranging for adults to supervise breakfast before classes begin is one problem. Another is scheduling buses to bring eligible children, but not others, to school early.
Because of such difficulties, only 35 percent of children in New York State who get lunch also have breakfast. Texas, with 50 percent, and California, with 40 percent, do a little better. Urban participation is often lower: in New York City, the figure is only about 26 percent. 
So poor children's nutrition depends increasingly on charitable groups. America's Second Harvest (www.secondharvest.org), a national network of food banks, reports that its affiliates now serve eight million children -- over half the number in school lunch programs. Many food banks turn away families for lack of supplies.
Private efforts are especially critical right now. Although summer school attendance has grown, school breakfast and lunch programs enroll a much smaller proportion of eligible children than during the regular school year. Researchers have found that achievement gaps between poor and middle-class students are greater in the summer than in the regular year. While experts can't say what role undernutrition plays in this extra summertime academic lag, food programs may be one way to address it.
Demands for academic proficiency of poor children enjoy wide support among voters. Yet reducing hunger that causes low test scores may be accomplished more easily than the various unproved educational reforms commonly advanced. A higher minimum wage that helps low-wage parents feed their children could be one important step in ensuring that no child is left behind.
And those wanting to narrow academic gaps can also take matters into their own hands, without relying on government: they can contribute to the nation's overstressed food banks. This too would amount to real education reform.

HEADLINE: Details Emerge On a Budget Meant to Hurt 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 31 

 BODY:
New details of the stripped-down budget that leaders in the State Legislature intend to pass later this week began to emerge today, and it was not a pretty picture for most state agencies and nonprofit organizations dependent on state help.
 The spartan budget would, for instance, eliminate a $150 million fund for buying new parkland, cut about $58 million in block grants to communities and make it impossible for the New York State Urban Development Corporation to underwrite more than $100 million in capital projects. Governor George E. Pataki has control over how these funds are used. 
 The budget would also cut the parks and recreation department's budget by about $26 million, with much of that reduction coming from grants to museums. The parks budget eliminates, for instance, a $13 million grant to the American Museum of Natural History and a $1 million grant for the Brooklyn Academy of Music. 
The budget would also keep in place a $113 million reduction in Medicaid financing that the governor proposed in January, though lawmakers do not intend to adopt an accompanying bill that would change reimbursements from Medicaid for nursing homes. As a result the program is likely to run short of money before the end of the year.
The bare-bones spending plan provides $90 million to replenish the state Superfund, which pays for cleaning up toxic waste sites when the polluter cannot be found. The fund had run out of money, and environmentalists say the $90 million is just enough to keep it afloat for another year.
Budget aides could not provide an overall size of the plan, but estimated it would end up being roughly the size of last year's spending, or $79.6 billion. For most agencies, the plan pares spending to last year's levels and holds up hundreds of millions of dollars worth of spending approved in previous years, according to the budget bills.
For the most part, the Legislature's spending plan hews very closely to the $83.6 billion executive budget Governor George E. Pataki proposed in January, accepting the spending limits he proposed or whittling down his appropriations to even lower levels than he wanted. 
But it also crosses out hundreds of millions of dollars worth of unspent appropriations passed in previous years, severely crimping the governor's ability to direct money to projects he likes. 
The Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the Republican Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, hope the minimalist plan will break a deadlock with the governor that has stymied budget talks for months. The impasse stems from a disagreement about the economic future and its impact on tax revenues.
The tactic Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno are employing is simple, but risky: passing a budget so spartan that the pain it causes will compel Mr. Pataki to join three-way talks on a supplemental budget restoring many of the new appropriations that were left out. The governor has so far refused to enter negotiations with legislative leaders, saying he finished his task when he drafted his budget.
Under the state constitution, the bills will become law automatically once they are passed because the Legislature has not increased spending, but simply fiddled with the governor's bills. Once those bills are passed, however, the Legislature will be free to work out and pass its own appropriations bills, putting the onus on the governor to sign them or veto them.
"It's shifting the balance," Mr. Silver said in an interview. "It's coming from executive budget-making process into a level playing field."
Senator Bruno said the budget's goal was to "avoid disruption in vital government services, even as we continue to negotiate supplemental funding for programs and new initiatives."
Mr. Pataki remained quiet about the minimalist spending plan today. His aides said he was still reviewing the details.
Some of those details are clearly meant to gall him. For instance, the Legislature pruned several organizations that receive money for conservation efforts in the Hudson Valley, a cause dear to the governor, who comes from Peekskill. The Legislature sliced $72 million from the Hudson River Park Trust, $82 million from the Greenway Heritage Conservancy for the Hudson River Valley and $376 million from the Hudson River Valley Greenway Conservation Council.
Both the Senate and the Assembly plan to be back in session on Thursday to pass the budget bills. This is the 17th straight year the state has failed to pass a budget by its April 1 deadline.
The budget accepts the governor's proposal to increase school aid by $382 billion, to about $14.1 billion, an increase of about 2.7 percent, which is close to the rate of inflation. School officials across the state are screaming that the increase is too little.
Other major state agencies are staring at what amounts to cutbacks if the governor walks away and does not agree to add money in a supplemental budget. The state welfare agency's budget, for instance, would drop to $2.5 billion from $4.8 billion, largely because of a disagreement about how to use a $1.4 billion federal fund for helping poor families. The department of health would take a $316 million cut, most of it coming from grants to local governments.
Among the health programs that would lose financing is the state's anti-AIDS effort, which stands to lose not only the $17 million cut the governor proposed, but about $7.2 million in unspent appropriations from last year. Some of that money was meant to be spent on new education and prevention programs in black and Hispanic communities, where AIDS rates are rising rapidly. 
"It's a terrible budget," said Michael Kink of Housing Works, a group that lobbies on behalf of AIDS victims. "I understand that it's a political gambit, but if this is allowed to stand as the state's final budget it cuts the heart out of our attempts to fight AIDS."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 2, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about budget proposals by New York legislators misstated the amounts of three cuts planned for conservation efforts in the Hudson Valley. The Hudson River Park Trust would lose $72,000, not $72 million; the Greenway Heritage Conservancy $82,000, not $82 million; and the Greenway Communities Council $376,000, not $376 million.

HEADLINE: Rural Towns Turn to Prisons To Reignite Their Economies 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: SAYRE, Okla., July 27 

 BODY:
For a town of 4,114 in western Oklahoma, Sayre has an impressive landfill. The scales to weigh the bales of crushed scrap are new. A machine for shredding trees is new. So, too, is the 60-unit apartment complex going up on the side of the road leading to the dump, the asphalt that covers that road, and the sprawling Flying J Truck Plaza nearby.
 The wording on a trash-hauling bin parked near the landfill gives a hint of what is behind the revival of this withered, century-old city. It reads "North Fork Correctional Facility." 
 As in many other small towns around the country, a three-year-old, $37 million, 1,440-inmate, 270-employee, all-male prison is responsible for lifting Sayre's spirits and reigniting its economy. 
"In my mind there's no more recession-proof form of economic development," said Jack McKennon, 52, the city manager who persuaded the Corrections Corporation of America to put its prison in Sayre. "Nothing's going to stop crime." 
Sayre is not alone in its economic strategy. According to the 2000 census, prisons have been helping to revive large stretches of rural America. More than a Wal-Mart or a meat-packing plant, state, federal and private prisons, typically housing 1,000 inmates and providing 300 jobs, can put a town on solid economic footing. As communities become more and more familiar with the benefits that prisons bring, they are also becoming increasingly adept at maximizing their windfall through collecting taxes and healthy public service fees.
In the last decade, 245 prisons sprouted in 212 of the nation's 2,290 rural counties, many in Great Plains towns of Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas that had been stripped of family farms and upended by the collapse of the 1980's oil boom, said Calvin L. Beale, senior demographer at the Economic Research Service of the Agriculture Department. 
Mr. Beale said an average of 25 new rural prisons opened each year in the 1990's, up from 16 in the 1980's and 4 in the 1970's. Growth followed. In the 212 prison counties, the population rose 12 percent in the 90's, far more than rate of 1.5 percent in the preceding decade. Three small Oklahoma cities with new prisons -- Hinton, Sayre and Watonga -- grew more than 40 percent. 
Opening a prison is a natural option for down-and-out towns, said Thomas F. Pogue, economics professor at the University of Iowa.
"It's a more stable industry for a town than a manufacturing plant," Professor Pogue said. "The wage level is a problem, but these prisons are being located where people don't have much of a choice."
The North Fork Correctional Facility, a mile and a half from downtown Sayre, is surrounded by buffalo grass and cottonwood trees. With light gray concrete walls and red metal roofs, it could pass for an immense new Comfort Inn were it not for double coils of razor wire and slotted windows. The access road for the buses that bring in new inmates is called Delivery Avenue. 
The prison's economic value to Sayre is immediately apparent. The Corrections Corporation of America, a private prison management company based in Nashville, is the largest taxpayer in Beckham County, of which Sayre is the seat. The county collects $411,000 in property taxes from the prison, more than four times the amount it gets from the next largest taxpayer, the Bar-S Foods Company, a meat-processing plant. Eighty percent of the property taxes support county schools. Jody Bradley, the prison's warden, said the prison spent $2.5 million a year for goods and services in Oklahoma, largely around Sayre, and disbursed about $7 million in wages. 
The prisoners are themselves cogs in Sayre's economic engine. They pay the city's 3.5 percent sales tax for the snacks and sodas they buy in the commissary. They also pay a 35 percent to 45 percent tax for the telephone calls, roughly 100 a day, all collect, all long distance. Local calls are forbidden for security reasons, not that it is much of an issue: the inmates all come from Wisconsin, which, because of a space shortage, farms out more than 4,000 prisoners to other states.
The prisoners help in other ways, too. The city has torn down the old high school and salvaged the bricks and stone work for a new City Hall. The bricks stand in stacks in the prison yard, where for no charge to the city, the inmates are cleaning them.
By any measure, Sayre, 120 miles west of Oklahoma City, was in perilous shape before the prison opened. Shattered by the oil and gas industry bust of the 1980's, it was surviving largely on federal crop support payments to its dwindling farm population, said Jack W. Ivester, the town's mayor. 
At one point, officials turned off every other street light on the main commercial thoroughfare to save money. In the center of town stood a reminder of better times, a stately court house, which had been featured as a backdrop in the 1940 film "Grapes of Wrath," starring Henry Fonda. 
Now Sayre can set aside 15 percent of its revenues for capital improvements. The money brought in from the telephone calls, sales taxes, water and sewer fees and landfill charges accounts for nearly all the increase in the city's budget from about $755,000 in 1996, before the prison construction began, to about $1,250,000 this year.
The money flowing into city coffers made it possible for Sayre to hire nine new employees, bringing the total to 30. Last year the city granted them $100,000 in raises. Mr. McKennon's salary has doubled to $48,000 in nine years. The police force has grown to eight officers from four, and for three years in a row, the city has been able to buy a new patrol car. Sayre has erected three new water towers, making five.
"We build two miles of improved streets each year now," Mr. McKennon said.
To lure the Flying J, Sayre bought 28 acres along Interstate 40 for a bargain price of $2,700 an acre and then sold the land to a developer at cost. The truck stop, which has been open less than a year, employs 117 people and is expected to pay $150,000 a year in sales taxes, said Chris Christian, the city treasurer.
"We wouldn't have gotten the Flying J without the prison," Mr. McKennon said. 
As a result, Beckham County's unemployment rate is a rock-bottom 1.7 percent, from 3.2 percent in 1998 when the prison was built, even as the nation's unemployment rate rises. 
"The ones that want to work, they can go out there and get a job," said Leroy Hagerman, who operates an auto-repair shop downtown.
Mr. Hagerman's daughter got one of the best jobs, as one of six captains at the prison. "Not many places where a single woman can make $30,000 a year," he said. 
While the prison's immediate economic value is clear, it remains an open question as to how deep or wide ranging its benefits will be.
The city's core population, excluding the 1,440 inmates, dropped in the 1990's to 2,644. from 2,881. Housing permits have more than doubled since the prison was built, though the market remains tight for the prison's 270 employees, most of whom earn $17,000 to $19,000 a year.
"The prison is a super positive for us," Mayor Ivester said. "But it's a life raft, an inner tube. We're still on the ocean. We're not going down, but we're not really going up either."
The prison can take a toll on local services, too. Linda Brown, the clerk of the Beckham County Court, said inmates began flooding her office with five or six complaints and other filings a week. Some were legitimate, like several who sent in divorce papers, Ms. Brown said, "but most seemed frivolous."
One inmate tried to change his name to Poison Jonathon Love. Among the reasons he listed was a desire to further his "modeling and acting career." Serious or not, Ms. Brown said, few inmates followed standard filing procedures.
"They wouldn't send the correct papers," she said, "so we would have to send them back."
She said the requests subsided after the warden posted a notice spelling out the procedures required.
Before the prison came, townspeople worried about indigent visitors and families of prisoners moving to town, possibly swelling the welfare rolls. But because they must travel from Wisconsin, only a few show up each day.
Residents say they went along with the prison, though there was never a vote for it. Many signed pro-prison petitions, which were circulated in banks and grocery stores around town.
"We all took a tour out there, a before-they-opened-type-thing," Clydene Manning, the county clerk, said of efforts to reassure residents. "I'd just never been inside a prison before. It looked like a safe and secure place to me." 
Some residents said they would have preferred a more inclusive process.
"My only complaint was it was kind of a done deal before the town really knew about it," said Belinda Wilkinson, the cashier at the Texaco station, about 100 yards from the prison and the closest business.
Sales are now brisk, Ms. Wilkinson added, though she also gets more bad checks, mostly from guards.
Residents' initial concerns for their safety have subsided. No prisoner has escaped; the inmate who came closest became ensnared on the prison's razor wire. But about 20 guards, residents of Sayre and surrounding communities, have been injured in fights and assaults. As many as 70 percent of all guards quit within a year, some for better-paying jobs in the recovering oil fields, and the prison is now 19 guards short, Mr. Bradley said. 
Sayre faces a larger problem. The nation may be on the verge of a prison glut, bad news for towns that have come to rely so heavily on them. Only 11 rural prisons have opened or are scheduled to open this year, compared with 38 in 1998, the peak building year, Mr. Beale of the Agriculture Department said. 
In Wisconsin, the growth of the inmate population has halted, and the Department of Corrections has set as an informal goal to stop exporting inmates within 10 years. Oklahoma sent some prisoners to Sayre three years ago but took them away because of a contract dispute with the Corrections Corporation of America, the nation's largest operator of private prisons. 
For now, the prison money is flowing, and Sayre is trying to build the foundation of an economy that might eventually get along without it.
Mr. McKennon wants a Wal-Mart distribution center, an Alco department store and above all a motel.
"I'll give you the land," he said, smiling in the 104-degree heat. "No way you can keep from getting rich."

HEADLINE: An Unenlightened Energy Bill 

 BODY:
In a rational world, the members of the House of Representatives would disappear on their August vacation this Friday without touching the energy bill that lies before them, then start all over again in September. The bill is a mishmash of four smaller measures written by four separate committees. It runs to 511 pages, which few members have actually digested. It contains some useful suggestions to improve electricity transmission and streamline the distribution of natural gas. It also has modest subsidies for alternative fuels like wind and solar power and modest tax credits for energy-efficient cars and homes. On the whole, however, it is a dismal compendium of tired ideas favoring the coal, oil and gas industries. 
 Nevertheless, voting is expected to begin today, and since most members are eager to show their constituents that they care about energy, passage is virtually assured. The best one can hope for is a series of ameliorative amendments that strip the bill of its worst provisions while adding others of real value. 
 Among the most objectionable sections is one that would open the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, disrupting an ecological treasure. Two members -- Nancy Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, and Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts -- will offer an amendment to strike it. They deserve their colleagues' strong support. Other bad provisions would weaken federal oversight of public lands coveted by the oil and gas industries or would otherwise threaten environmental values in wilderness areas that are best left alone. Republican moderates led by Sherwood Boehlert of New York have been negotiating with the leadership to soften these provisions. They should be struck entirely.
Meanwhile, Mr. Boehlert and Mr. Markey have persuaded the leadership to allow a vote on an amendment that would make meaningful changes in fuel economy standards as opposed to the trivial improvements now contained in the bill. The amendment would close the so-called S.U.V. loophole, under which large vehicles like S.U.V.'s and minivans are classified as light trucks and therefore escape the 27.5-mile-per-gallon standard required of ordinary cars. By some estimates, closing that loophole could result in oil savings of more than one million barrels a day by 2015, considerably more than the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would be expected to produce in the same time frame. 
These and other amendments would do much to redress the imbalance between exploration and conservation that now disfigures the bill, much as it disfigured President Bush's original energy plan. Regrettably, however, the leadership has said that some provisions are untouchable. These include lucrative tax breaks for industry that, in the aggregate, greatly exceed the incentives for conservation. The coal industry benefits more than any other, with billions in subsidies for "clean coal" technologies. The moderates are insisting that some of this be spent on coal gasification, the one technology with real promise. But there are billions in additional tax breaks that offer no apparent yield in terms of efficiency or cleaner air.

HEADLINE: Argentina's Bid to Save Itself 

 BODY:
Argentina took an important symbolic step on Monday in its struggle to avoid financial collapse. The country's Senate passed a law committing itself to a balanced budget, paving the way for wage cuts for public employees and tax increases. Whether the provinces will follow the federal government's orders of fiscal prudence remains to be seen. But in the meantime, leaders of the world's economic powers should help Argentina by speeding up aid and expressing confidence in its latest efforts. 
 More than anything, recession-plagued Argentina needs time. Several months of quietly servicing its debt of $130 billion without incurring new obligations might lure foreign investors back. A second debt swap, now under consideration, would help by replacing a relatively small issue of three- and six-month notes, sold every two weeks, with 18-month notes sold at longer intervals. The country's new "zero deficit" law is meant to prevent additional borrowing, but it will work only if the provinces cooperate by restraining spending. Argentina needs fiscal responsibility to guarantee a future that should eventually include less debt and exchange rates that are determined by the market. 
 During any respite, Argentina would have to avoid a run on its banks. Deposits are already falling. Civil unrest orchestrated by thousands of unemployed workers could increase fears of financial distress. The government must be careful not to create flashpoints with an authoritarian reaction.
A run on the banks would be a problem not just for Argentina but for financial markets elsewhere in Latin America, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. It would also threaten the stability of a country just beginning to blossom as a multi-party democracy.
The world's big economies have a strong interest in seeing that Argentina weathers the storm. The comments by Tony Blair, Britain's prime minister, praising the Argentine Senate's action will help to reassure depositors. John Taylor, America's under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, also suggested speeding up I.M.F. aid in recognition of Argentina's recent progress. To further bolster confidence, President Bush should join in standing behind Argentina's economic reforms.

Blessed Are the Weak

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill recently gave an interview in which he dismissed claims that the dollar was overvalued, arguing that concerns about our trade deficit are based on "trivial and wrong notions." He also thinks that concepts like gross domestic product are obsolete. I took his remarks as an indication that the dollar's inevitable decline will probably come sooner rather than later. And while that will be embarrassing for Mr. O'Neill, it will be a good thing for our economy.
 Why does Mr. O'Neill's nonchalance suggest that the strong dollar's days are numbered? Because there is a clear analogy between the soaring dollar and the recent tech bubble. As Robert Shiller pointed out in his book "Irrational Exuberance," a gradually rising asset price acts like a natural Ponzi scheme, in which each new wave of investors creates capital gains for the previous wave. If this goes on long enough, it can silence the doubters. 
 But eventually the process ends -- and you know that the end is nigh when white-haired executives reject old-fashioned accounting. That means that the mania has spread to the suits, and that the Ponzi scheme is about to run out of suckers.
The dollar has been rising against the currencies of other industrial countries since the middle of the 1990's. This sustained rise has made dollar bears look foolish, but it has also priced U.S. products out of world markets. Since 1995 the U.S. current account deficit, the difference between what we buy from foreigners and what we sell to them, has quadrupled to an astonishing $450 billion. It goes without saying that this is the biggest such deficit in world history. More startling is the fact that at 4.5 percent of G.D.P., the U.S. current account deficit is a bigger share of our economy than the deficits of Indonesia or South Korea on the eve of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. 
In the past, deficits this large have always led to a currency plunge. True, one hears arguments to the effect that the rules have changed, that this time is different. Those arguments were presumably what Mr. O'Neill had in mind when he dismissed concerns about the payments deficit. Alas, it would be easier to take those arguments seriously if they weren't so similar to the arguments people used to justify the high dollar of the mid-1980's, just before it started dropping. 
More ominously, I heard exactly the same arguments -- especially the claim that rising productivity justifies a strong currency -- used to dismiss concerns about Mexico's current account deficit just before the 1995 peso crisis, and again in Asia two years later.
But would a sharp drop in the dollar be a catastrophe? Probably not. In fact, if the dollar is going to plunge one of these days, now would be a pretty good time. I wouldn't have said that a year and a half ago; but times have changed.
Not long ago a drop in the dollar would have been a clear negative for the global economy. A weaker dollar, which makes U.S. goods cheaper compared with the products of other countries, redistributes world demand toward the U.S. and away from the rest of the world. Back when the U.S. economy was booming, this would have been shipping coals to Newcastle; we already had plenty of demand, while other economies were depressed. 
Now, however, the U.S. economy has stumbled, and the strong dollar is one of the reasons the Fed is having trouble pulling us back from the brink. So right now a weaker dollar is in America's interests. It still might create some problems elsewhere -- but on the other hand it might be just the shock needed to wake the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan from their policy slumbers.
Is that a call to action? Should we actively seek to drive the dollar down? There's a precedent: In 1985 James Baker, who was then secretary of the Treasury, organized an international effort to tame the too-strong dollar. It's still debatable whether his efforts made any difference; possibly the dollar would have fallen in any case. But it was a political triumph: Mr. Baker managed to take credit for the dollar's decline. Alas, Mr. O'Neill's ramblings have probably prevented him from achieving any comparable feat. 
But never mind Mr. O'Neill; the great dollar decline is coming, and we should welcome its arrival.

PHELPS DODGE IS EXPECTING THIRD CONSECUTIVE LOSS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 The Phelps Dodge Corporation, a leading copper producer, said it expected a loss in the third quarter because of weakening demand. The company, based in Phoenix, will lose $1.10 to $1.20 a share, before any one-time gains or losses, its chairman, J. Steven Whisler, said. It would be the third consecutive quarterly loss for Phelps Dodge. "We have just not seen the recovery we expected," Mr. Whisler said. "The severe slowdown in the U.S. economy is starting to impact Latin America and Europe, particularly in Germany."

HEADLINE: Use of Shelters By Families Sets Record in City 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
The number of homeless families lodging nightly in New York City's shelter system has risen higher than ever and the trend is accelerating, city officials said yesterday. With a critical shortage of low-cost housing, and applications for shelter running 30 percent higher than last year, officials say they expect new records to be set this winter. 
 No single factor explains the startling growth in homeless families in New York, which has been echoed in cities around the country, including Washington, Chicago and Oakland, Calif. But city officials and national researchers said likely explanations include housing costs driven higher in an economic boom, followed by a slowdown that has hit poor families harder in an America cutting welfare and a new reluctance by landlords to accept subsidized tenants. 
 By July, there were a record 6,252 families, with 11,594 children, in temporary beds, city figures show. Overall, there were 20,655 members of homeless families in the shelter system, surpassing the previous peaks of the late 1980's and mid-1990's, when about 18,700 people in 5,700 families were in temporary shelter. Current figures reflect an increase of more than 1,000 families since July 2000 alone. 
"This is off the charts," said Leonard Koerner, the city's chief assistant corporation counsel, who has been defending the city's homeless policies in court.
At the Emergency Assistance Unit in the Bronx, New York City's sole access point for homeless families seeking shelter, city figures show a number of applicants at levels not seen since the recession of the early 1990's. But with the city no longer supplying the stream of low-cost housing that absorbed thousands of families from the shelters in the past, fewer people are leaving the shelter system even as hundreds more crowd in each month.
Among them yesterday were Elizabeth Marrero, 29, and her two children, Bianca, 7, and Peter, 8, who have been shuttling between short-term beds and the unit since July 19.
"There's people sleeping on the floor, kids crying, the place is dirty -- it's like a nightmare," Ms. Marrero said. "If I would have a place to go I wouldn't put my kids through this." 
She added that her son had been unable to attend summer school for lack of a stable place to live, and would have to repeat the third grade.
New York City has the only shelter system in the nation that operates under a court-ordered right to shelter for the truly homeless. On a typical night in July, it gave beds to 28,029 people, including 5,682 single men and 1,692 single women.
The number of single adults in the municipal shelters traditionally rises in cold weather, so by the end of the year, city officials and advocates for the homeless predict, the number of homeless people in the shelter system will exceed the previous high of 28,737, recorded in March 1987. That level spurred the Koch administration to begin a 10-year effort to get permanent housing for the homeless.
"This is completely careening out of control," said Mary Brosnahan Sullivan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless. "The next mayor may be sworn in on Jan. 1 with an all-time high in the number of homeless. How shocking that is at the end of an economic boom."
The boom itself has played a role, by raising rents to levels even many working families cannot pay, city officials and advocates agreed. Even as housing costs stay high, families at the bottom now seem to be catching the brunt of a national slowdown in the economy. And in a recent change in policy, the Giuliani administration is now scrambling to add low-cost permanent housing to the mix, but city officials say they are having little success.
Hundreds of Section 8 vouchers, federal subsidies that bridge the difference between income and a moderate rent, are going unused, Mr. Koerner said, because landlords are rejecting them despite city bonuses and a streamlined bureaucracy.
"It's not peculiar to New York City," Mr. Koerner said. "It may be a function of the good economy -- they're treating Section 8 as tenants of last resort."
Martha Burt, an authority on homelessness who directs social service research programs at the Urban Institute in Washington, said similar complaints were echoed by providers of homeless services in 25 research sites around the country this spring.
"There is nowhere in this country that anybody can find housing with what you can pay under Section 8," she said. "All over the country that is the story, and getting people placed is extremely difficult. New York City, with its right to shelter, is actually experiencing something closer to the truth than other communities whose actual delivery of family shelter is limited by the resources the community is willing to supply, and whose level of requests is limited by people's knowledge that they will be turned away."
But advocates for the homeless in New York attribute much of the current problem to the lack of low-cost housing initiatives since thousands of tax-delinquent apartments were rehabilitated under the Koch administration's 10-year plan.
The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which had produced 1,500 apartments a year for the homeless at the peak of the Koch plan, provided only 117 apartments in a nine-month period last year, city officials told the City Council recently.
Mayor Giuliani and his predecessor, David N. Dinkins, both turned away from the use of hotels as family shelters in the 1990's, and most regular shelter is now provided by private nonprofit groups by city contract. But under pressure from court orders to stop leaving homeless families to sleep on the floor of the Emergency Assistance Unit, the city has sharply increased the use of temporary beds.
Last month the city had more than 2,100 families in hotels and "scattered site" shelter, paying landlords the equivalent of $3,000 a month for night-to-night apartments.
"The city has created an incentive and a market for landlords to rent apartments for three times what either a federal subsidy or a city subsidy would cover," said Steven Banks, director of the Homeless Rights Project of the Legal Aid Society. "The city's put itself in this bind by neglecting the housing needs of low-income and working families for eight years." 
Last January, Judge Helen E. Freedman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan found that more than 700 people were crowded into the Emergency Assistance Unit daily, including children missing school because only one-night beds were provided for them, and that as many as 32 families a night were left to sleep on the floor or on benches.
In April, the judge found that the city had redoubled its efforts, and extracted a promise from Mr. Koerner to show a steady reduction of families repeatedly shuttled to different shelters for a few hours of sleep. 
But Mr. Koerner said yesterday that city plans had anticipated an 8 percent increase in homeless families applying for shelter, not a 30 percent rise.
Monday night, 8 adults and 14 children were left to sleep on the floor of the Emergency Assistance Unit. They were still there yesterday morning when the Marrero family returned from a temporary shelter placement in Queens to reapply. 
"I felt so sorry for them," Ms. Marrero said. 
So did Bianca, her daughter. "I'm hoping they'll replace us somewhere where we know we'll be all right," Bianca said. "The worst thing is when your friends see you they, like, tease you and stuff -- 'You're in the shelter, you don't have no home.' "

HEADLINE: Business Travel; 
The industry is abuzz with speculation, but few hard answers, as to when the downturn will end.

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
ROUND and round went the toy train on a platform the size of a kitchen table. A man at the Amtrak display booth intently watched the little five-car model Acela Express buzz across the track, as if it were moving in something other than a circle.
 Where better than at the railroad booth to pose the question that many of the 4,000 attendees at the annual National Business Travel Association convention and trade show were pondering here yesterday as they went to seminars, heard speeches and cruised the acres of exhibits from travel suppliers and others in the corporate travel market: Does anybody see the light at the end of the tunnel? 
 I asked Dennis J. Graham, the brand director for Amtrak's ballyhooed new Acela Express high-speed train, which began on the Washington-New York-Boston corridor in December (with disappointing business-travel ridership so far, industry analysts say). "No sign of it yet," he said as laconically as a platform conductor looking up the tracks for an overdue train. 
Mr. Graham said that a lot of corporate travel managers had been stopping by to look over the Amtrak displays and reservations systems, and no one is talking about a quick resumption of the kind of frenetic business travel pace we saw last year.
"I'm afraid we haven't seen the complete bottom of this yet," he said pessimistically.
Still, the only palpable gloom discernible among those in attendance came in the muttering here and there about the diminished quality of the promotional souvenirs passed out at exhibitors' booths this year. Mostly gone were the caps, T-shirts, battery-operated blinking key chains, and corporate mascot pinatas -- replaced in many cases by plastic key chains and pens with logos.
The reality of how quickly and unexpectedly the climate went bad in the business travel industry was underscored this week by a report by the Air Transport Association, a trade organization for the major domestic airlines, which predicted that the airlines would lose a total of about $1.5 billion this year. Last year, the trade group had projected airline profits this year of over $2 billion. Airlines make most of their money from business travelers.
"The actual number of people traveling now is not that far off from the record level of last year," Leo F. Mullin, the chairman and chief executive of Delta Air Lines, which is based here, said in an interview before he delivered the keynote address at yesterday's lunch session of the convention.
Leisure travel is holding up "reasonably well," although fares and revenue are down through a combination of promotional sales and intensifying consumer price comparison shopping on the Internet, he said. "But in the major business markets we are seeing a 30 percent drop in our most lucrative business traffic," which is the last-minute full-fare customer, he continued.
"The walk-up fare has tremendously dropped," while business travel in general has been "cascading down from first class to business class to coach to not traveling at all," he added.
Light at the end of the tunnel? "I would say that in the last month to six weeks, we've seen what I would characterize as a plateau," after the sharp declines of the spring, he replied, adding: "Business is not worsening anymore, but it is not improving, either. So the good news is, I feel we are on this plateau; but the bad news is, I don't know how long we'll be on this plateau."
Some executives found opportunity in the slowdown, meanwhile. 
"It's just amazing what a pack mentality we all really have," said Marka Jenkins, the chief executive officer of Highwire Inc., a developer of corporate online travel technology based in Seattle whose clients include Microsoft and other high-technology companies. "A year and a half ago, with all the dot-coms, especially, there was not a thought about cutting back on business travel." 
When cutbacks suddenly arrived, one ramification was an accelerated shift by many corporations to requiring employees to use proprietary in-house Internet booking sites to make lower-cost travel arrangements. The corporate online booking industry took off as a result.
On Monday, Galileo International, the international provider of computer reservation services for the travel industry, announced that it had acquired Ms. Jenkins's company.
"The catalyst for that was the current slowdown," said Babetta R. Gray, an executive vice president of Galileo, which, she said, plans to plunge more enthusiastically into the in-house corporate booking business.
"It certainly is my opinion that we're not going to see any recovery in business travel this year," Ms. Gray said. "Most of our customers have made their adjustments for this year. The intelligence I'm hearing kicked around is look for the return sometime during the second quarter of 2002. That's what the large customers are saying."
Brian J. Murphy, the vice president for sales and marketing for Aer Lingus, the Irish airline, said, "Everybody's looking to everyone else for a sign." Aer Lingus has recently begun a major push for business travelers as Ireland's economy has boomed.
A few aisles away, Cheryl Berkman, the chief executive of Music Express, a provider of luxury limousine services based in Burbank, Calif., that caters worldwide to entertainers and business travelers, said that she thought she saw that sign.
"In the entertainment business, there are constant premiers, concerts, parties, and those people never cut back anything," she said. "Corporate, they tightened their belts this year. But now, we see them starting to come back more. Corporate people who a few months ago were very conservative are loosening up, like they're ready to rock and roll again."

HEADLINE: Chief Abruptly Quits Business Magazine Group 

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
In a move that underscores the fragility of a critical sector of the magazine industry, David Carey, the president and chief executive of the business magazine division at Gruner & Jahr, resigned yesterday after just six months and will return to his previous job as publisher of The New Yorker. 
 The suddenness of Mr. Carey's departure shocked executives in the magazine industry yesterday. A highly visible publisher with a challenging mandate, Mr. Carey had been hired with a generous salary and the promise of long-term bonuses. More important, he had joined Gruner & Jahr as an entrepreneur who would shape the multimedia vision for the newly formed Business Innovator Group, which included Fast Company and Inc. magazines, both acquired by Gruner & Jahr last year. Many executives said that their high-ticket price tags -- $200 million for Inc. and $365 million for Fast Company -- required an established publisher like Mr. Carey who could prove that the products were worthy of the price tags. 
 But rather than acting as a entrepreneur to expand the division and develop new businesses, Mr. Carey found himself struggling to save it as advertising revenue dropped off sharply. And according to Gruner & Jahr executives, Mr. Carey was also frustrated by the company's slower, more committee-oriented management structure and by the fact that pivotal financial decisions were often made final by Axel Ganz, the president of the international magazine division. At Conde Nast, which owns The New Yorker, Mr. Carey had been able to make publishing decisions after meeting with the chairman, S. I. Newhouse Jr., or the chief executive, Steven T. Florio, executives said yesterday.
When Mr. Carey left The New Yorker in January, no one had yet predicted just how radically the advertising slump would affect business magazines like Fast Company and Inc. Many of their advertisers were either casualties of the dot-com bust or became reluctant to spend money on print campaigns as the economy sputtered. 
In the first six months of 2001, ad pages for Fast Company plunged 47.2 percent, to 512 pages from 969.9 pages in the period a year earlier, according to the Publishers Information Bureau.
Advertising pages at Inc. have fallen 44.3 percent, to 478.5 pages from 859.1. 
David Verklin, the chief executive at Carat North America, a media services company, said that business magazines in particular were suffering.
"Advertising is in the nose cone of the American economy," Mr. Verklin said. "And if advertising is in the nose cone of the economy, the business magazines and business-to-business advertising is the heat-resistant tile. They are all struggling in a really difficult economy."
Gruner & Jahr, which is owned by Bertelsmann A.G. of Germany, was been expanding and retooling since Daniel B. Brewster became chief executive in May of last year. Last June, Mr. Brewster supervised the purchase of Inc. from the privately held Goldhirsh Group for $200 million, and last December bought Fast Company from Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the New York real estate investor, in a deal that eventually paid Mr. Zuckerman close to $365 million. 
Yesterday, Mr. Carey said his departure was not necessarily spurred by the negative advertising news from Fast Company and Inc. 
"It is a year of great change in the publishing industry, which everyone knows," Mr. Carey said. "I was offered a chance to essentially turn back the clock and return to a job that I loved doing and did reasonably well, and I enjoyed a very close relationship with the magazine's editor. That is an opportunity you have to take seriously."
Under David Kahn, who took over as publisher of The New Yorker after Mr. Carey's departure, The New Yorker performed reasonably well, considering the marketplace. For the first six months of 2001, advertising pages fell 4.6 percent, to 1,100 from 1,153 in the period a year earlier, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. But revenue rose 10 percent, to $53 million, for the first six months of this year, according to the bureau.
Mr. Kahn, who had served as Mr. Carey's deputy, will step aside to become the chief executive of a new division of Conde Nast, the Conde Nast Image Center, which will market and license material from the Conde Nast archives.
Mr. Brewster sent a brief memorandum to Gruner & Jahr staff members yesterday, detailing temporary management plans. A company spokeswoman, Sue Geramian, said that he had no further comment.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Tries to Counter Lack of Support Among Women 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31 

 BODY:
Republicans inside and outside the White House are focusing anew on the party's disadvantage among women in the electorate, a problem that has persisted -- and by some recent measures worsened -- through the beginning of the Bush administration.
 Earlier this month, the Republican National Committee announced that it would pump millions of dollars a year into a new campaign, "Winning Women," to be led by the committee's new co-chairwoman, Ann Wagner, who eagerly introduces herself as a 38-year-old suburban mom. 
 Later this week, when Vice President Dick Cheney attends a special meeting of Congressional Republican leaders, a key topic will be the need for Republicans to talk more about education, an emphasis intended to appeal to women.
In addition, the White House and the Republican Party are trying to draw fresh attention to the large number of women in senior positions in the Bush administration. 
Several recent surveys by Republican pollsters suggest that the party's focus on a sweeping tax cut and the Bush administration's widely criticized environmental decisions have cost Republicans some support among women and widened Democrats' advantage among them.
A poll last week by Public Opinion Strategies showed that while men, by 43 percent to 37 percent, said they were more likely to vote for a Republican than a Democrat, women were more likely to do the opposite by 47 percent to 32 percent.
"This is not happy data," said Bill McInturff, the Republican pollster who conducted the survey.
Mr. McInturff said the size of the so-called gender gap in his survey was not enormous and might turn out to be something of a blip.
But it was nonetheless consistent with the results of monthly surveys that David Winston, another Republican pollster, has been presenting to House Republican leaders.
Although Mr. Winston declined to discuss specific figures from his research, Republicans familiar with it said they were similar to Mr. McInturff's and revealed, in particular, a precipitous drop since February in Republican support among married women with children. That subset is one with which Republican candidates traditionally do best.
Mr. Winston said the trend was attributable in large part to the way in which, during President Bush's first six months in office, the administration and the party let taxes and the economy eclipse issues like education and health care, which are especially important to women.
"It's just a pure example that if you're going to sustain a coalition, you have to talk about issues that matter to that coalition," Mr. Winston said.
Mr. Bush himself seems to be doing better with female voters than the Republican Party in general. Polls over the last two months have put his job approval rating among women well over 45 percent and not more than five to seven percentage points below his rating among men.
But several Republican strategists and pollsters said some of the administration's early decisions had undoubtedly alienated women and probably contributed to the party's problems with them, difficulties that could haunt Republicans in Congressional elections next year.
"The president needs to understand that in the first six months, many women believe that he has drifted to the right," said Linda Di Vall, a Republican pollster, adding that his actions "on the environment in particular have caused him some trouble with women."
Although administration officials say they are not concerned, some of their activities, along with the efforts of the Republican National Committee, suggest a fresh concern with strengthening support among women, who are a majority of the electorate.
Both the White House and the national committee are trying to arrange events around the country at which leading businesswomen can be introduced to high-ranking women in the Bush administration. One of the first occurred last week in Manhattan, where female magazine editors and publishers met not only Ms. Wagner but also Lezlee Westine, who directs the White House's public liaison office, and Mary Matalin, Mr. Cheney's top political aide.
Several administration officials said the White House and the party were not getting the credit they deserved for the number of women in top White House positions, a fact that they said would impress and help attract female voters.
To that end, Ms. Wagner said, a Web site affiliated with the "Winning Women" campaign will feature profiles of people like Karen P. Hughes, counselor to the president, and Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser.
Ms. Wagner, who joined the national committee earlier this year, is also traveling widely and carefully marketing herself as a kind of soccer-mom everywoman. She said in a telephone interview today that what defined contemporary women -- and what the party needed to speak to -- were their crammed, busy lives.
"We're juggling a lot of balls," Ms. Wagner, who lives in a suburb of St. Louis, said from her R.N.C. office here. "I know I am, as a working mother of three children -- 12- and 10-year-old boys and a 6-year-old girl. My daughter, Ruth, is running around here right now."
"I sing in the church choir," she said. "I run into women at the swim meet conferences, the Little League games, the grocery store, airports. I talk to real women every single day."
Ms. Wagner, Ms. Matalin and other Republican women involved in new efforts to reach female voters said that both the Republican agenda in general and the Bush agenda in particular had strong appeal to women, so long as they were sold and explained well.
They pointed to Mr. Bush's push for education reform, which is likely to be enacted in some form. Pollsters and strategists agreed that Mr. Bush and other Republicans could gain ground among women by drawing more attention to education. Mr. Bush and House Republican leaders plan to talk about that issue extensively during the August recess and in September.
But Ms. Wagner, Ms. Matalin and other Republican leaders also said that women, as the principal balancers of checkbooks, could be made to appreciate the tax cut more and that women, as the principal caretakers of children, could be made to care more about a missile defense shield that might serve as a protection against terrorist attack.
Some Republican strategists and lawmakers scoffed at that thinking as optimistic and shallow, saying it focused too much on the packaging and not enough on the product.
"It's fundamentally a question of the issues," said Representative Marge Roukema, a New Jersey Republican. In her view, she said, most women do not support the Republican position on a patients' bill of rights or abortion, and that is a problem that outreach will not cure.

 Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the investment vehicle of Warren E. Buffett, agreed to buy the Xtra Corporation, a container leasing company, for about $590 million, the companies said yesterday. Berkshire agreed to pay $55 a share and to assume another $710 million in Xtra's debt. Berkshire's investment comes as shipping companies that lease Xtra's equipment struggle in a slowing economy. Xtra said yesterday that profit in its most recent quarter fell 57 percent because of lower freight demand and increased costs. Julian H. Robertson Jr., the billionaire who leads Tiger Management and is Xtra's biggest shareholder, agreed to the transaction. Xtra will remain at its headquarters in Westport, Conn., and operate as a wholly owned subsidiary.

HEADLINE: WHITMAN TO ISSUE ORDER TO DREDGE HUDSON FOR PCB'S 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The federal Environmental Protection Agency's administrator, Christie Whitman, has agreed to go ahead with a plan issued in the closing days of the Clinton administration requiring the General Electric Company to spend more than half a billion dollars to dredge PCB pollution from the Hudson River, according to officials at the agency.
 The draft order, which will become official in 30 days after a government review, will set into motion the biggest environmental dredging plan in United States history, after more than two decades of disputes over the science of dredging and the political, economic and moral issues of corporate responsibility. 
 The order to dredge a 40-mile stretch of the Hudson north of Albany is a huge defeat for G.E., which had spent tens of millions of dollars fighting the proposal. The question of dredging the Hudson had also become a test for the Bush administration, which has been pilloried in recent months by environmental groups for its policies on energy and the international efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions. 
"We're staying the course," said a senior official with the agency, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "It's time to move on, and we're committed to cleaning up the river."
The official said that White House officials had been briefed about Mrs. Whitman's decision, and that in the next 30 days, New York State and federal agencies that would have a role in the cleanup, including the Interior Department, would have an opportunity to comment. No changes in the plan are expected, the official said.
There was no immediate indication of whether President Bush had been briefed on the agency's decision. 
The company's vice president for corporate environmental programs, Stephen D. Ramsey, declined to comment on the draft order, saying G.E. did not have adequate information yet. 
After the Clinton administration approved the preliminary cleanup proposal in December, the plan entered a public comment period that extended through the early months of the Bush administration. Environmental officials said that they had to extend the comment period because of the huge volume of people and organizations that wanted to respond, and that it had taken until this week to analyze all the information. 
The draft order closely follows the Clinton administration proposal, which would require G.E. to pay for the removal, or remove by itself, about 2.65 million cubic yards of river bottom of the Hudson from the Troy Dam to the Thompson Island Pool, about 35 miles north of Albany. 
An estimated 1.1 million pounds of PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls, which have been linked to cancer in humans and various disorders in wildlife, were spilled or dumped into the river by G.E. from its plants along the upper Hudson from the mid-1940's until 1977, when the chemicals were banned. The draft order, as did the Clinton administration plan, proposes to remove about 100,000 pounds of the oily chemical from the river. Much of the PCB's that entered the river are believed to have dispersed by now. 
The new draft order will create a few changes in how the cleanup will proceed. E.P.A. officials said that the changes were intended as improvements but that they could delay the cleanup. Officials said that unlike the Clinton plan, the draft order would create a staged cleanup process, and that performance would be reviewed at each phase. Among the issues that will be examined are noise, odor, effect on river traffic, and especially the question of resuspension -- that is, whether the dredging process itself stirs up PCB's from the river bottom mud and recontaminates the water. 
The possibility that dredging could somehow backfire and repollute a river that by many measures is cleaner than it has been in generations became a nagging fear expressed by many people living near the proposed dredging areas. Officials at the environmental agency said last night that the draft plan took those concerns into account. 
They said that if the performance reviews found that PCB's were actually being freed from the bottom mud, the dredging process would be re-evaluated. A major change in a cleanup order, once it has been issued, could require the entire plan to be redrafted, and officials said that resuspension, if it occurred, could be a big enough problem to force a redrafting. 
"Yes, there are some unanswered questions about all of this," a senior E.P.A. official said. "But the agency believes it's time to move forward, and our own scientists have said we won't learn everything until we do some of this stuff. What's different here is that we're trying to respond to the concerns of the impacted communities."
General Electric, which waged an extensive public relations campaign against the dredging, as well as a far-flung scientific effort to investigate how PCB's behave under the changing conditions of a river bottom, had contended that the Hudson was essentially cleaning itself by entombing the chemicals under successive layers of silt. Declining levels of the pollutant had been measured in fish caught in the river, the company said, a sign that a natural process was at work.
Company officials, and allies of the company, also argued that the technology of dredging, especially on a scale envisioned by the federal plan, was far from foolproof and that active dredging was therefore both dangerous and unnecessary. E.P.A. scientists, in defending their plan over the last eight months, agreed that PCB levels had declined in the river fish, but said the improvement had leveled off in recent years, indicating that only full removal of the chemical would entirely solve the problem.
Under the federal Superfund law that the government has applied on the Hudson, a final order for a cleanup cannot be challenged in court, and E.P.A. officials said last night that they planned to begin preparing the engineering design for the project as early as September, a process that is expected to take up to a year.
But there are major questions remaining about who would actually do the work -- G.E. or the government -- and E.P.A. officials said there were several issues within that part of the order that could bring the parties into court and produce delays. 
Specifically, G.E. could agree to do the work itself. If it declined to do that, then the government could proceed with a cleanup itself, or get a court order requiring G.E. to do the work, and it is that court order that could be challenged, E.P.A. officials said.

HEADLINE: Air Force One Has Flown, but Clinton's Still Celebrity in Chief 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
He used to stop traffic. Now he sits in it.
 He used to run government agencies like the Internal Revenue Service. Now he shares a building with their ground-level outposts. 
 He once negotiated treaties with Ehud Barak and Tony Blair. Now he teams with the songwriter Babyface to advocate his causes. 
Such is the day-to-day life of Citizen Bill Clinton. After a raucous rally welcoming him to the neighborhood on Monday, he is settling into Harlem, and his new life. At every turn something reminds him of the presidential trappings he has lost. 
But at every turn, something else reminds him of the power he still has. The requests to serve on boards and to support causes have come by the hundreds. So have the interview requests (from major media outlets, obscure foreign publications and even a cigar magazine, wanting him to pose for its cover). Countless citizens have written with ideas for him to implement.
With such an array of options, a man never known for his discretion at a buffet must choose carefully. 
More than anything, his public service now relies on private commitments and contributions. He implored "ordinary middle-class people who don't have a lot of money" to donate to fight the international AIDS crisis yesterday. He wants corporations to invest in Harlem and other inner cities. 
After months of quiet groundwork, he has begun to take his priorities public. Yesterday, he held a news conference with Kenneth Edmonds, the multi-Grammy-winning songwriter and producer known as Babyface, to discuss his support for the International AIDS Trust, a nonprofit run by Mr. Clinton's former AIDS czar, Sandra Thurman. Mr. Clinton heads the organization's board of advisers. Mr. Edmonds, a friend of the former president's, will give concerts and produce a CD to support the cause. 
Whether the small conference room at the Midtown offices of Sun International was packed with reporters because of Mr. Clinton or Mr. Edmonds, it was packed. And so, calling himself the "resident policy wonk," Mr. Clinton reeled off facts about the epidemic spread of AIDS -- now at 36 million to 40 million cases worldwide. He said governments' putting money into fighting AIDS was not enough; it was equally important to develop the mechanisms to spend the money effectively for treatment and prevention.
He stressed repeatedly the world's interdependence. "This is not an African problem," he said, "and it's not a problem America has solved, because we have it in our backyard." He stressed, as well, that he was acting only as a private citizen. 
After the news conference, it was into a Ford Expedition for a 23-minute, stop-at-every-red-light ride up Madison Avenue to his Harlem office. A yellow cab carrying a reporter beat him.
He met and posed for pictures with visiting Arkansas legislators. He met with Richard D. Parsons, vice chairman of AOL Time Warner; the presidents of Tommy Hilfiger and Court TV; and others to discuss the National Campaign Against Youth Violence. 
He sat for a long-promised interview for a documentary on the rise of the global economy, discoursing with erudite enthusiasm about the importance of trade and the need for global responsibility on issues like the environment. 
Then it was off to the Dakota apartment of Jane Rosenthal, the president of TriBeCa Productions, where close to 100 people had gathered to hear about the AIDS trust. Mr. Clinton spoke movingly of the need to act, as did Mr. Edmonds, who drew loud cheers from the upscale crowd when he called Mr. Clinton "one of the best presidents we've ever had." 
In the crowd of celebrities, Mr. Clinton was still celebrity in chief. He greeted, often with bear hugs, friends like Robert De Niro, Harvey Weinstein, Donald Trump (who invited him to play golf) and Oscar de la Renta.
Then it was off to LaGuardia Airport for the 9 p.m. shuttle to Washington, to see his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, and her mother, who is recovering from surgery. 
Peppered throughout the day were those small reminders that Mr. Clinton was just Mr. Clinton now. At the Dakota, where during his presidency the police had shielded his limousine from public view with a blue tarpaulin, he simply hopped out of the Expedition in the driveway and shook some hands. 
Earlier at his Harlem office building, when aides and Secret Service agents piled into the Expedition, he tried to upright a lowered seat back so he could sit. 
It was stuck. He tried again. And kept trying. 
"Sir," an agent said from the front seat. Then he leaned back and lifted the seat. Mr. Clinton hopped in.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Portrays Himself As a Leader for Hard Times 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that New York City was descending into rough economic times and predicted that the city's budget would be battered by declining tax revenues and rising costs for labor contracts and welfare over the next four years. Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican mayoral candidate, said his business background made him particularly qualified to lead the city through any slowdown.
 But even as Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire founder of Bloomberg L.P., argued that voters should look outside the political system for a new mayor during this time of fiscal distress, rather than to any of the career public officials who are his rivals, he offered only the most general indications of how he would deal with the situation he warned of. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, who has never held public office, said that if elected, he would rely on his commissioners for suggestions on spending cuts and take steps to expand the city's tax base. Such steps, he said, would include encouraging private development and making New York a more desirable place to live by repairing the city's school system. Mr. Bloomberg also said he would bring to City Hall the methods that had improved the morale and efficiency of employees at his financial information company. 
He cited, for example, company picnics, dinners with employees and his insistence on first-name interactions with employees. He said the "only time I snap at people" is when they call him Mr. Bloomberg. "My name is Mike," Mr. Bloomberg said. (But with limits. "You can't have free food for everybody," he said, signaling that one Bloomberg company perk would not follow him from Park Avenue to City Hall.)
Beyond the issue of the city's economy, which was clearly his central concern during a 90-minute interview with editors and reporters of The New York Times yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg broke from his opponents as he contended that the city could best encourage construction of middle-class housing through the private sector, rather than by using public subsidies. He argued that the city should instead remove what he termed cumbersome land-use and environmental reviews that discouraged developers from building.
He said he opposed a proposal that has been raised by most of his opponents: that the city use any increased revenues from the operation of the World Trade Center to finance housing construction.
Mr. Bloomberg, who has been courting the support of the city teachers' union, took a less stringent approach to ineffective teachers than some of his opponents had, putting more emphasis on training than on ways to remove them from the classroom. He also predicted that the Board of Education would be effectively abolished by the time a new mayor took office, a timetable and a view that are in fact not widely shared by government officials in Albany, where such a change would need to be approved.
Mr. Bloomberg faces a Republican primary on Sept. 11 with one major opponent, Herman Badillo. But his attention yesterday was focused on the general election with a Democrat, reflecting the view of his aides that he will easily defeat Mr. Badillo. In setting out such a stark view of New York City's economy, Mr. Bloomberg offered a glimpse of what would be his general election campaign appeal: a successful businessman is better suited than a career politician to lead New York through difficult times.
"The economy for the next four years does not look like it's going to be the economy" of the last decade, he said, noting reports of layoffs, declining tourism and a falloff on Wall Street.
"The outlook at least for the next few years is not one that should give you comfort that the city is going to be able to do everything," he said. "What I will say to the voters is it is going to be hard times and somebody has to manage and somebody has to make decisions. And sitting there and saying, 'I'm going to do everything' or, 'I'm going to do what's politic' is not going to get us through the next four years."
He added: "All of the people you interview have an awful lot more in common than I have with them. And say things differently and I mean I would argue that I am the only one running that has" the skills needed to run City Hall.
Mr. Bloomberg arrived for the interview after a month in which some offhand remarks he has made -- like suggesting that there was minimal discrimination in the Northeast -- have attracted news coverage that Mr. Bloomberg's advisers worry could distract from his campaign. By contrast yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg spoke mostly in generalities, and he frequently responded to questions by offering a detailed discussion of the problem without suggesting what he might do about it.
For example, when Mr. Bloomberg was asked if he believed that a certain level of civil rights abuse was a necessary trade-off for more intense policing in New York City, he responded with a discursive answer that began with a review of the human rights situations in China and Singapore.
"Well there is a level that we -- whether it's this level or a different level," he responded. "The extremes are places like China where you have no civil liberties, but a billion-odd people do have jobs. They're not starving in China, but there's certainly no freedom. Singapore where it's -- the Singapore people if you -- most Singaporeans would think that they made a good bargain."
When a questioner asked if Mr. Bloomberg might bring the question back to New York, he responded by offering his view of how he thought New Yorkers saw the issue. "In New York I think if you ask most people are they willing to have certain limitations placed on them if the quid pro quo is safe streets," he said.
The candidate said he would not release any more financial information about his private business partners than that required by the city to guard against potential conflicts. "Why, so you can go and harass them now?" he asked a reporter.
He bristled at questions about how much of his own money he intended to spend to win City Hall, as he rejected the suggestion that his personal wealth gave him an unfair advantage over his opponents. "I'm the David against Goliath because I don't have all of that visibility and public awareness," he said.
Throughout his interview, Mr. Bloomberg offered a different perspective on government and its procedures, often expressing frustration over practices that people in government tend to take for granted. 
Why, he asked, are traffic agents not using digital cameras to take photographs of illegally parked cars, and mailing them to drivers with a ticket, to avoid problems of illegible tickets? Why, Mr. Bloomberg said, does a Federal Express delivery agent instantly know the precise location of a package when "the cop doesn't know who he's talking to and whether they have a criminal record?" He added, "We haven't used technology very well."
More conventionally, Mr. Bloomberg said he supported the extension of rent stabilization laws and did not agree with the argument of some developers that the laws were what accounted for the housing shortage in New York. He also said he opposed legislation that would require New York City police officers to live in the city, saying it would only complicate the task of filling vacancies. He said school principals should be given increased authority to decide on classroom assignments for teachers.
On the budget, Mr. Bloomberg said he would oppose any tax increases, warning that they could further erode the city's fiscal standing. He also said that he would support reducing or eliminating some minor taxes as part of an effort to cut back on paperwork for businesses.
At the same time, though, he talked about ways he would spend money as mayor, beyond the salary increases that he noted would be provided for city workers in new contracts. "People are sleeping on the doorsteps of churches. You can't leave them,' Mr. Bloomberg said.
He also said New York should not abandon ambitious public works projects in the interest of austerity. "This is the Big Apple," Mr. Bloomberg observed. "You have to think big, you have to think long term. We can't walk away from the grand projects."
Mr. Bloomberg said the first thing he would do, if elected, would be to ask Mr. Giuliani to impose a hiring freeze. Beyond that, he said he would approach City Hall the same way he would approach his company if it faced fiscal difficulties: he would summon city commissioners and ask them to find areas that could be cut.
"You've got to go to every department and say, 'X percent, you've just got to cut,' " he said. "And then you listen to those, let them make cases where they have reasons why you shouldn't. And then you exercise what you've been elected for: the judgment to say yes, no, yes, no."
Yet Mr. Bloomberg, as he considered his remarks, said there was a limit to how much could be saved. "There is an enormous waste out there," he said. "There are some wastes -- and you can certainly do some things. But you can't just overnight say, 'Oh, I'll go and I'll get a 30 percent raise for the teachers by cutting out inefficiency.' Come on. I mean, government -- if there were those kinds of inefficiencies, you would have written about it and there would have been a firestorm. And they would have -- that's not the real world."

HEADLINE: Gas Giant In Russia Told to Guard Its Assets 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 31 

 BODY:
The directors of Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, ordered the company's managers today to keep a closer watch on Gazprom's property and to curtail the privileged relationship that Itera, a Florida-based gas trading company, has enjoyed with Gazprom.
 At a board meeting, the directors discussed the results of an audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers of the links between Gazprom and Itera. Investors have said they suspect that Itera is secretly partly owned by Gazprom managers, a charge both companies deny. 
 Gazprom, 38 percent owned by the Russian government, is at the center of the country's economy. It has come under fire from both private shareholders and government officials, who say valuable assets like gas fields have been improperly transferred to outside companies. Last month, President Vladimir V. Putin replaced the company's entrenched chief executive with a close ally, Alexei Miller; today's meeting was the first since then.
The four-month confidential audit found that Gazprom has indeed allowed assets to slip away, but concluded that no laws were broken in the process, according to the United Financial Group, a Moscow-based investment bank, whose clients, investors in Gazprom shares, are represented on the board.
"A lot of suspicions of investors were confirmed," said Boris Fyodorov, a board member representing minority shareholders. Still, he said, "this isn't a 100 percent open battle, where all the wrongs are corrected immediately."
"Yes, there will be some improvements," he said, "but we'll have to analyze concrete actions over the longer term."
The auditors reported that they were not given enough information to answer a central question: whether Gazprom managers benefited from the asset transfers.
Some of the damage the audit found may be reparable. The report laid out how Gazprom could retake control of Purgaz, a Siberian gas producer that it sold to Itera very cheaply in 1999. And the board voted at the meeting to buy back control of Zapsibgazprom, another Siberian gas producer. Gazprom's stake in the company was diluted last year when it opted out of a share issue; it tried and failed to regain control earlier this year.
Complicating the Zapsibgazprom matter is the question of who controls the licenses for its gas fields. Its reserves accounted for 3 percent of Gazprom's total, Mr. Fyodorov said. 
Gazprom has lost control over a number of subsidiaries in one-sided deals. Though Kremlin officials, including Mr. Putin, have acknowledged that Gazprom was shortchanged and sometimes acted against its own interest, officials say Russian law offers little or no scope for criminal prosecutions. 
"Everything was done without violating the law," said Dmitri Avdeev, an oil analyst at the United Financial Group. "I don't think the assets will be returned. What's lost is lost."
Gazprom's audited 2000 accounts showed that it had extended $3.4 billion in loan guarantees to unrelated companies, including Itera. At a shareholders' meeting last month, Rem Vyakhirev, the former chief executive, refused to explain why such guarantees had been extended to Itera, ostensibly a competitor.
The mood at today's meeting was much more open and businesslike than in the past, showing that "a lot of things have changed in the last month," Mr. Fyodorov said.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Delays Effort to Give Bush Latitude On Free Trade 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31 

 BODY:
Short of votes to push through President Bush's top trade priority, Republican leaders of the House said today that they would delay until fall the effort to give the president broad authority to negotiate new trade agreements.
 The decision was a setback for the president, but it was not unexpected. While Republicans had held out the hope that they could act this week, no bill has yet been written in committee on the contentious issue that sharply divides the Congress. 
 And Republican leaders have devoted most of their attention and muscle to the president's energy agenda and the battle over a patients' bill of rights as they push toward a summer recess at the end of this week. 
"The long and short of it is we don't have enough Democratic votes," said Representative Dick Armey, the House majority leader, as he announced that Republicans would wait until fall to consider legislation granting the president the authority to negotiate trade treaties that could not be amended by Congress and could only be approved or rejected via an up-or-down vote.
President Bush, answering questions from reporters in the Oval Office, spoke out against those who oppose giving the president such a free hand to strike trade deals. "Some people in America don't believe in free trade," he said. "Some people believe that a protectionist policy would be best for our country's economy and the workers. I strongly disagree."
He said he remained optimistic that he would prevail. "Whether we get it done before August is obviously up in the air," he said. "But I believe when it's all said and done that Congress will realize the benefits of free trade to the people of America."
The delay buys more time for the administration and House Republicans to mount a concerted lobbying effort and to negotiate a bill with the moderate Democrats whose support will be critical in the House.
But the delay could also pose problems for the president, making a Congressional timetable ever more uncertain. Last week, Mr. Bush said it was crucial to have the authority in time for a World Trade Organization conference in Qatar in November that could start a new round of global trade talks.
Every president since Gerald R. Ford has had the ability to negotiate trade deals that had to be voted up or down by lawmakers without changes. But after winning passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, President Clinton allowed the authority to lapse rather than take up a second trade issue that would divide his party. After that he was never able to win Congressional support for the authority.
Mr. Bush is encountering many of the same crosscurrents that stymied the Clinton administration -- including fierce resistance from labor unions to giving the president a free hand in trade talks. 
While Republicans generally support free trade, their support is not universal. That means Mr. Bush must draw votes from Democratic moderates in the House. Representative William M. Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has begun trying to reach a compromise bill with some Democrats.
The moderates, however, want some assurances that labor and environmental standards can be safeguarded as part of trade negotiations, while conservative Republicans say they do not believe that trade agreements should be vehicles for enforcing social standards.

HEADLINE: Some Energy Executives Urge U.S. Shift on Global Warming 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN and NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
With President Bush continuing to oppose international or domestic restrictions on gases linked to global warming, among the losers are energy companies that favor government action and have already spent millions on voluntary efforts to cut emissions.
 Given little credence by the White House despite large expenditures on lobbying and longstanding ties to administration officials, these companies are shifting their focus to Congress, where several bills that would impose emissions restrictions are being debated or prepared. 
 But in that effort, the companies face formidable opposition from other energy concerns and trade groups that are fighting against any limits.
"There's an enormous amount of lobbying going on," said Rob Long, vice president for government affairs at the National Mining Association. "It's a three-ring circus." 
Among the companies that want the United States to embrace some form of greenhouse-gas limits are oil producers including the Royal Dutch/Shell Group and BP, as well as power-generating companies like Cinergy, AEP and Entergy, all of which have moved to reduce their own emissions. 
Another company holding this view is the Enron Corporation of Houston, whose chairman is Mr. Bush's friend Kenneth L. Lay. Enron was the largest contributor among energy companies last year to the Republican Party.
These companies, which include some of the world's biggest producers and users of fossil fuels, have concluded that limits on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse, or heat-trapping, gases are inevitable. They say that by packaging reductions in greenhouse gas emissions with other environmental measures, like cutting other power plant emissions, they could win concessions on other pollution rules.
And to plan long-term investments, they want the predictability that comes from quick adoption of clear rules, although more flexible ones than those agreed to in Bonn a week ago by 178 countries that have accepted the Kyoto Protocol, the worldwide climate agreement that President Bush rejects. 
Most of these businesses share Mr. Bush's view that the Kyoto agreement could hurt the United States economy and that it unfairly requires emissions reductions only of big industrial nations. But many officials of these companies said Mr. Bush had blundered by rejecting the agreement outright instead of trying to repair it.
"What businesses want is policy certainty," an environmental expert for a large international energy company said. "Bush has injected only turbulence."
For all their wealth, power and influence, though, these companies say they have been cut out of discussions at the White House. The only ideas that have risen to the highest levels there are those of companies staunchly opposing limits on emissions, according to lobbyists, government officials and executives.
The Bush administration denied last night that it was excluding any options or ideas in trying to develop an approach to global warming. A White House spokeswoman, Claire E. Buchan, said: "We are taking this issue very seriously. We're listening to constituencies who represent all perspectives."
In contrast to executives of companies seeking limits on the gases, people representing companies opposed to restrictions, including Exxon Mobil and many coal companies, said they thought that their message was resonating. 
Fredrick D. Palmer, executive vice president for legal and external affairs at Peabody Energy of St. Louis, one of the world's largest coal producers, said it was not really necessary to lobby the Bush administration on the issue, because Big Coal's interests and the administration's views were in sync from the start. 
"We don't need to be talking to the White House to know what they want," Mr. Palmer said. "I understand the importance of fossil fuels to the American people. Dick Cheney understands that. The president understands that."
For the moment, the two corporate camps -- which have dominated the discussion, with environmental groups largely locked out -- have turned to Congress, where an array of influential members from both parties is hoping to seize the initiative in policy making. 
Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, the independent and new chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, has said that global warming is his top priority. Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, has joined with Senator Robert C. Byrd, the veteran Democrat from West Virginia, a leading coal-producing state, in introducing a bill aimed at controlling emissions. Mr. Stevens has recently expressed deep concern about the apparently growing damage in his state from climate change.
The energy industry now is focusing its efforts on the energy legislation moving through the House. But company executives and lobbyists are also meeting with members of Congress and administration officials to shape the discussion over a variety of impending emissions measures and proposed changes in regulations. 
In mid-August, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to make recommendations to the White House on how to reduce releases of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury from power plants.
And Mr. Jeffords plans to hold meetings with industry, environmentalists and agency officials in September to seek a consensus on a bill to control the three pollutants, along with ways to limit carbon dioxide, the dominant greenhouse gas. 
The one thing so far that unifies the energy industry is its opposition to the Jeffords emissions bill in its current form, mainly because it stipulates that old power plants install the latest technology to clean up emissions within five years. Power producers say that the timetable is too stringent and that such a change would disproportionately hurt the Midwest, where most of the power is generated by older coal-fired plants that are targets of the legislation.
Beyond that, the industry separates into distinct camps. For energy companies willing to accept some limits on warming gases, one goal is to firm up a market for tradeable credits earned by companies that make sharp cuts in emissions or plant or protect forests, which absorb carbon dioxide.
For such credits to have value, a limit on emissions must exist, the company officials say. Aware of corporate resistance to mandatory limits, some energy industry executives and lobbyists have proposed that the government sponsor a voluntary program to reduce emissions. Once enrolled, companies would have to meet mandatory goals on reductions of greenhouse gases.
"We haven't said there must be mandatory caps on CO2," said Jeffrey Keeler, director of environmental strategies at Enron. "But it's been proven that voluntary programs don't work well; that's why we are where we are today. We can have limits from the top down and not endanger the economy."
Whether the Bush administration will accept even voluntary limits remains to be seen. And later this year, the White House will again be the focus of policy making. 
Businesses that share the view Mr. Bush expressed in March, when he rejected any binding limits on the warming gases, whether in a global accord or federal legislation, say they are confident that there will be no big shifts.
For example, Mr. Long, the mining association official, said he was perplexed by those companies that want to reduce carbon dioxide, which his group and its allies do not see as a pollutant or a threat to the environment.
"I think some of this is the hangover from the Clintonian era, when some of these emissions changes seemed inevitable," he said. "And I think some people got locked into that mind-set. I think the world changed in January. It can't have escaped their notice that the new president won't support constraints on CO2 ."
One of the staunchest foes of limits on carbon dioxide is the Southern Company of Atlanta, whose nuclear and coal-fired plants span Georgia, Florida, Alabama and Mississippi, and whose donations to the Republican Party last year were second only to Enron's. 
The company recently enlisted Haley Barbour, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as a lobbyist. Mr. Barbour mainly works to loosen enforcement of environmental regulations affecting utilities, though other Washington lobbyists said that he had also argued against action on reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Mr. Barbour did not return phone calls yesterday seeking comment.
Power companies trying to find a way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions think they have greater sway with Congress than they have with the White House. "The closer we get to midterm elections," a utility executive said, "both sides of the Hill will feel a high degree of vulnerability on environmental issues, and some will retreat from the White House if they feel they need to."
In the meantime, opponents of emissions limits are not assuming that the Kyoto accord is dead, despite its having been greatly weakened by the rejection from the United States, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. 
Their lobbyists were out in force at last week's negotiations in Bonn, and they said they would keep working to defeat the international agreement, which is still subject to ratification in scores of countries. Among other things, they plan to keep pressure on the Bush administration to propose no alternatives -- particularly anything resembling a limit on greenhouse gases.
"The protocol is like the Titanic," said Glenn Kelly, executive director of the Global Climate Coalition, which has fought against the Kyoto agreement using contributions from industries that regard gas restrictions as a threat. 
Eventually, he said in an interview in Bonn, the Kyoto Protocol will hit an iceberg, but that will not be the end of the matter. "After it sinks," he said, "there are still going to be lifeboats that survive to be picked up by the next ship that comes along."

HEADLINE: Making Plans for the New Economic Reality in Store for New York 

 BODY:
 Following are excerpts from an interview with Michael R. Bloomberg, the media entrepreneur and a Republican candidate for mayor. The interview was conducted yesterday by editors and reporters of The New York Times, and it is the fourth in a planned series of interviews with each of the major candidates.

Q. One guy all the candidates are talking about is Mayor Giuliani, about how they would be like him and how they would be unlike him. Give us your -- how would you be like him and unlike him?

A. Rudy has done the city a great service over the last eight years. I don't think there's any question but that by most measures this city is much more livable for almost all its citizens than it was eight years ago. Rudy was the beneficiary of a good economy. Rudy was the beneficiary of Washington focusing on helping cities. Rudy was the beneficiary of some demographic trends. But to not give Rudy credit for making a difference in this city seems to me ridiculous.
 I think his great contribution other than showing that the city was governable was the technique that he used. I would describe his management contribution to be trying to take down to the neighborhood level the accountability, responsibility along with authority, if you will, to tailor the delivery of services to each neighborhood. . . .
 Rudy's management style was to take down to the local level the delivery of services, tailoring it. And I think -- we can talk about education later -- but that is in fact exactly what you have to do. You have to find a way and there are all sorts of reasons why it's difficult to do, but every school is different in the same way every precinct is different. And you've got to find ways to let professionals deliver services tailored to the neighborhoods. And I think that's Rudy's big contribution. . . .
 I think the mistake that everybody makes when they try to compare themselves to Rudy is that Rudy governed during the last eight years and the next mayor is going to govern during the next four years. And those periods are going to be very different. There will be different opportunities and there will be different problems. The greatest, the most obvious, difference is that the economy for the next four years does not look like it's going to be the economy of the last, in number of years, 8 years, 10 years. . . .

Q. But circumstances aside, economic or otherwise, you've started putting on commercials in which you've said in essence that you will continue Rudy Giuliani's work. In a more personal way, how would you do that?

A. . . . What I've done is, I've focused No. 1 on our -- the only asset that matters, and that is our people. You can replace our technology, you can replace our data, you can replace our customer base, you can replace everything. I defy you to go ahead and try to put together 7,000 or 8,000 people that work together, that cooperate, that feel that they are making a contribution, that want to service our customers.
 That's what I've done. And my whole style, management style, is to focus on people. And I think that is the mayor's, in some senses after -- I'm saying a vision. The mayor's job is to get the quarter of a million people in this city who actually deliver the services to work together. . . .
 And my strategy, my style, has always been: the only time I snap at people is if they call me Mr. Bloomberg. My name is Mike, because I want to address everybody else by their first name. I am trying to do everything I can in our company, and I would try to do everything I can in the government. And they are different organizations and you can't do it the same ways. But the intent is certainly the same. In our company, we don't have walls. Nobody has private offices, including me. Why? Because those are impediments to people working together. . . .

Q. Give us some practical, practical ways in which you'd do that with this quarter-of-a-million work force. . . .

A. You've got to go and visit each department. You've got to have -- you've got to sit down. Most of the workers of the city are unionized. They've got to understand that you have a personal relationship outside of the adversarial contract negotiations, which unfortunately go on and on and on. The real damage there is that there's never a time when the mayor isn't an adversary. Once you make a pact, then the mayor, instead of being an adversary, is the advocate. And that's what you've got to find ways to do. And they are not big things. They are small things, of going around -- the mayor has to spend time in every borough, as many different neighborhoods as he can. But the mayor's got to also focus on all parts of the city, all of the different departments, and make those people understand. It may not be the biggest priority right now. We may not have enormous problems with that particular department. But that the mayor cares.

Q. Would that -- I'm sorry -- would that alone deal with the hard times that you say could be ----

A. No. Absolutely not.

Q. So what else do you do then?

A. . . . There's an awful lot of evidence that the future is happening right now. Visitors to the city -- down. Which means tax revenues go down. Wall Street business -- down. Means tax revenues are going to go down. Layoffs, tax revenues. I mean it's a whole variety of reasons why you know that the scenario from now on is lower tax revenue.
 At the same time, we don't know yet, but it's starting to look like the demand for services will go up. . . . And you know that the expense of the labor force is going up. . . .
 What happens in scenarios like that? The first thing that is normally done is smoke-and-mirrors accounting. That's a bad idea. Deferring maintenance. That's a terrible idea. And borrowing. All three things postpone for the future the solution. They take all the pain and roll it ahead so that you don't have to face it today. It's a feel-good thing. Everybody's happy. Whether it's the leader in a company or in government, those are the natural reactions.
 And I think we've seen just how bad the effect is of all three of those.
 Then, the next step, if things really get bad -- and everybody says they won't do it -- you have to cut services and/or raise taxes if things get really bad. You can't just print money. We're not the federal government.
 No. We are up against borrowing limits. You don't want to do that. Tax rises -- I don't think so. Particularly, you don't want to raise taxes when the economy is slowing down, and you want to make this city more attractive. . . .

Q. So what are you going to cut? What are your priorities? Which departments are first?

A. Well, I'll tell you how to go about that. It's very simple. Every department you have -- you can clearly go and say we're under pressure, no more hiring. That's the first stop. . . .

Q. Would a hiring freeze include the Police Department?

A. We unfortunately don't have to put a hiring freeze -- at the moment we cannot maintain the current size of the staff. And I think you have to do that. You have to -- in every case you have to say, if you cut back what is the effect and are we willing to tolerate that? . . . The first basic service that government has to provide is the safety of its citizens. You've got to be able to go out without looking over your shoulder. If you don't have that you don't have anything else.

Q. So is that what you're saying, that your hiring freeze would not apply to police?

A. No. I didn't say that. I said it would, if crime started to go up, I would make sure that it did not.

Q. What about the Board of Education? Would the same stand for hiring teachers?

A. Board of Ed. Let's talk about education. No. 1, I assume that by the fall -- by January -- or at least I hope by January the mayor has control over the Board of Ed. or chancellor, but controls the school system. There are a variety of ways you could work it out. There does seem to be a political consensus to give the mayor control. . . .

Q. Would you abolish the school board?

A. I don't know there's any reason, necessarily, for them. But it doesn't matter as long as the mayor has direct control. . . .

Q. What is the role of the mayor? You can exhort, as you are at this table. But how do you get what you want?

A. Well, the mayor's not without power. No. 1, in the new world, we hope the mayor will appoint the chancellor, either directly or through a board. No. 2, the mayor does negotiate the contract with the unions. You know, it's easy to go and to whip the U.F.T. But the last time I checked, it took two parties to make a contract. And if somebody in -- some mayor agreed to every single thing in the U.F.T.'s contract. And some of the stuff in the U.F.T.'s contract clearly does not help the educational process. I think that's a nice way to phrase it. Can you imagine what kind of police services we would have? What public safety we would have if every police officer could pick which neighborhood they worked in and which job they took and which shift they took? Come on. That's exactly what's happened with the U.F.T. contract. But you can't just blame the U.F.T. I suppose you can't blame them at all because their job is to get the best deal for their members. It's the city that has abrogated its responsibility when it came time to negotiate. . . .
 The principal is the person that I would put in charge of the school and make them responsible and accountable and to make sure that they have the authority to do what they need to to. The U.F.T.'s contract says that the teachers can pick the school, pick the grade, whatever. Can't do that. You have to let the principal move the labor force around and assign teachers to where they are needed. . . . 

Q. Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Ferrer was in here the other day and said that fear defines the relationship with a large number of people in the city, between them and the police.

A. I don't know whether large is the right answer -- the right word or not. But I think it clearly is true. . . . How would you like to be a young teenager bopping down the street on a dark night and you turn the corner and there are these two big cops coming at you? Forget about whether they're black or white or Latino or Asian or whatever. There is a natural fear. It comes out of abuses in society -- some probably written about more than -- it's not every day with everybody. But there's no question that that is a fact. O.K. Let's do something about it. . . . You go to the schools; you go to the churches; you enlist the teachers and the clergy; you invite people down; you find programs that get the teenagers and the police to get to know each other a little better. And you have education programs. You have measurement tools to make sure. You know, nothing wrong with looking at the racial makeup of those stopped and then decide whether or not it is racial profiling or whether it was reflecting whatever that particular community happened to be. I mean, you know, there are problems. . . . And you cannot have any tolerance whatsoever for the abuses. . . .

Q. Mr. Bloomberg, the message coming from this mayor, unspoken, the last eight years is that a certain level of civil rights abuse -- not Louima . . . but stop-and-frisks, for example -- a certain level of what many would say are civil rights abuses is tolerable in order to keep crime down. And that's the bargain that society has struck in New York City in the last two terms. Do you think a certain level of civil rights abuses are tolerable to keep crime down?

A. Well there is a level that we -- whether it's this level or a different level. The extremes are places like China where you have no civil liberties, but a billion-odd people do have jobs. They're not starving in China, but there's certainly no freedom. Singapore where it's -- the Singapore people if you -- most Singaporeans would think that they made a good bargain ----

Q. Let's talk about ----

A. I was working down to New York. In New York, I think if you ask most people are they willing to have certain limitations placed on them if the quid pro quo is safe streets. Yes. I'll give you a good example. Washington Square Park is under constant surveillance now by police cameras. It is posted. It says: area under surveillance. Whether that has satisfied the A.C.L.U. or not, I don't know. I haven't seen anybody take them to court, so presumably they don't mind it or they think that they would not have a good case. But I think most of the residents who live around that park would say having that surveillance, that intrusion on their personal privacy, is a good compromise for getting rid of the drug dealers.

Q. What about stopping and frisking? . . .

A. Well, No. 1, if it's done based on race, clearly it is against the law.

Q. Well if you're in a black neighborhood they're going to be black. To play devil's advocate.

A. Are they doing the same things in the white neighborhoods? That would give me some comfort that it was not racial profiling. That would be a test. In white neighborhoods, do they stop four teenagers as frequently as they stop four teenagers in a black neighborhood? . . .

Q. You've said a couple of times that you wouldn't raise taxes. Are there any taxes that you would either cut back or abolish?

A. Well, I think -- there's 22 separate city taxes. And anything that doesn't bring in appreciable revenue, yes. . . .

Q. There seems to be a bit of a bandwagon among some of your opponents to take the World Trade Center tax revenue -- $100 million -- and put that into subsidized housing. Are you part of that steamroller?

A. I'm fundamentally opposed to dedicating any stream of revenue to any particular project. In a world where we just had a long conversation about how you were going to have cutbacks and make hard choices, you don't want to go and get around that through either the normal subterfuge of creating agencies so that you can borrow against revenues that may or may not be there.

Q. The city, to the extent that it's had an economic development strategy has been to give people like you large amounts of money to stay in the city. And I'm thinking of the New York Stock Exchange and thinking about your new building. Are you going to take the money? And should other people take the money?

A. They haven't given us anything. For 20 years they have offered us, every time we've redone a lease, tax incentives. And we have never taken them. I have instructed the guy who is running the company to postpone that decision till after the election because I don't want people to say he did or did not do it for political reasons. And from a practical point of view, remember, if I did walk away from $14 million, you'd write a story: Oh, Mike just spent another $14 million to become mayor. If I do it afterwards, it'll have absolutely nothing to do with it. Come on, you're not going to trap me into that one. . . .

Q. If you are elected mayor, speaking about your company, and the public doesn't know who the private partners are that own the shares that you privately, in your family, don't own. How will the citizens know whether or not there's a conflict of interest in the way that you ----

A. If the Conflict of Interest Board said we should disclose it, I would not have a problem. It's been in the papers. . . .

Q. In your disclosure forms it's not there.

A. I understand that, but I don't have an obligation to disclose what other people are doing. I have an obligation to disclose what I'm doing. But I believe the answer to your question is, it is public knowledge who the other partners are? They're all tiny, it's not going to be a conflict. And if the Conflict of Interest Board thinks it is, I'll tell them. . . .

Q. How much do you think you're going to spend of your own money to get elected in this race?

A. I don't know.

Q. What's an outer limit, do you think?

A. I've said that I will spend what I think is required to -- I think I'll spend what is required to get my message out. I think if you take a look at the history of self-financed candidates, three-quarters lose. There's no evidence that you can buy it and it's sort of insulting to the public to think you can buy an election. . . .

HEADLINE: Verizon Posts a Loss and Cuts 2001 Forecasts 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Verizon Communications lowered its profit forecast for the year yesterday, citing falling demand for business phone services, and it posted a second-quarter loss as the value of some investments dropped.
 Verizon, one of the regional Bell giants, said that before write-downs it expected a profit of $3.07 to $3.12 a share, down from the $3.13 to $3.17 it had forecast earlier. 
 It also cut its sales-growth forecast to a range of 5 to 6 percent from 7 percent in April. 
Verizon, based in New York, had 62.5 million phone lines in June, down 0.4 percent from a year earlier. It was the first time that Verizon, or the companies that merged to form it, Bell Atlantic and GTE, had such a drop in at least eight years, a spokesman, Peter Thonis, said.
The company's chief financial officer, Fred Salerno, said that job cutbacks by businesses, increased use of mobile phones and slowing American economic growth all reduced demand. Last week, BellSouth and Qwest Communications International trimmed their full-year forecasts, citing the weak economy.
Shares of Verizon fell $1.87 yesterday, to $54.15.
For the second quarter, the company reported a loss of $1 billion, or 38 cents a share, in contrast to net income of $4.9 billion, or $1.79 a share, in the period a year earlier.
Revenue, adjusted for the sale of wireless properties, rose 5 percent, to $16.9 billion, the company said.
The recent quarter's loss reflected $3.1 billion in special charges, including $2.9 billion in investment write-downs related to stakes in Cable and Wireless P.L.C., NTL Inc. and the Metromedia Fiber Network, and $162 million from consolidating billing systems and offices. In the period a year earlier, Verizon said it had a net gain of $2.9 billion. That included a gain of $1.9 billion from restructuring an investment and $1.5 billion from asset sales. The company also had $749 million in merger costs.
Excluding those items, Verizon's profit rose to $2.1 billion, or 77 cents a share, from $2 billion, or 72 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. On that basis, the company matched analysts' estimates.
Second-quarter sales of data-transmission services rose 25 percent, the company said. Verizon added 120,000 customers for fast Internet access, for a total of 840,000. The number of long-distance customers increased 804,000, to 6 million, as Verizon aggressively solicited business in New York and other states where it has been authorized by the F.C.C. to provide long-distance service. 
Verizon Wireless, the nation's largest mobile phone operator and a joint venture of Verizon and the Vodafone Group, added 808,000 subscribers, for a total of 27.9 million, up 13 percent from a year earlier.
After delaying its initial stock sale, Verizon Wireless said it might revise the terms of an agreement to buy a unit of Price Communications. Under a deal announced last November, Verizon was to acquire Price Communications Wireless for $2.06 billion.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE ART; 
Matching The Battery To the Task

BYLINE:  By David Pogue; E-mail: Pogue@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IF the F.B.I. ever singled me out for surveillance, its final report wouldn't hold much interest. "Wife, two kids, dog. Watches 'Survivor.' Aversion to mayo." Only one line at the end of the document might seem a little peculiar. "Buys AA batteries by the gross."
 These days, most gizmos -- digital cameras, palmtops, music players -- seem to have been designed in a conspiracy with Duracell: they guzzle batteries like Gatorade at the marathon finish line. And it's not just me. According to an Industrial Market Research survey, the average American has about 25 battery-operated gadgets in the house, up from only 7 in 1987. 
 The battery makers, of course, are delighted. All around us, we see ads for new kinds of batteries that "offer unsurpassed power for today's demanding devices," "last longer on high-tech devices" and have "longer service life." In the name of science, I decided to perform a few simple tests: I'd pop sets of each heavily hyped battery into, say, a Palm organizer and see how long they took to run down. What could be more scientific? 
As it turns out, almost anything. When I shared my plans with representatives of the Big Three -- Duracell, Eveready and Rayovac -- they told me, with the weary sighs of people who explain this point to journalists every day, that battery run-down tests are terribly misleading. For starters, a battery designed to excel in such a test would do poorly in the real world, where people play, pause and put aside their electronics for days or weeks. Who on earth actually runs a gadget continuously until it's out of power? (Game Boy owners, you can put your hands down.) Furthermore, the battery makers say, there is much greater inconsistency in the power consumption of supposedly identical devices than between two different batteries.
"We'd be delighted to help you design valid tests," one battery company representative said. "And we'll look forward to reading the results around Christmas."
When people conduct proper battery tests -- the repetitive, expensive, computer-controlled sort prescribed by the American National Standards Institute -- they find little variation across brands. One such test, published by Consumer Reports in March, offered a straightforward conclusion: When you need standard alkalines, ignore the marketing; just buy the cheapest ones.
Whatever size you're looking for, from tiny AAA's to fat C's and D's, the hard part is figuring out whether to buy the standard alkalines or some other type. Until 1980, you had only one type to choose: the silver "heavy duty" batteries, like the Eveready types with the black-cat logo. But that era is long over. 
What replaced those old "standard" batteries is a wide and confusing range of higher-powered battery types: alkaline, premium alkaline, rechargeable alkaline, nickel metal hydride and lithium. (All told, 92 percent of the batteries sold nationwide are alkalines, which offer from two to six times as much life at roughly the same price as the old "heavy duty" type.) 
It would feel glorious to declare one type the winner and then rent a movie to celebrate. Alas, batteries aren't that simple. 
In general, you can break down today's battery-operated devices into three categories. First, there are low-drain gadgets that sip power with all the gusto of an elderly aunt at afternoon tea: radios, clocks and flashlights that you keep on hand only for emergencies.
The vast majority of today's electronic gizmos fall into the moderate-drain category: tape recorders, Game Boys, music and CD players, electronic toys, pagers, boomboxes, smoke detectors, remote controls and flashlights that you'll use a lot -- when camping, for example. The third category, high-drain devices, has only a few occupants -- like digital cameras, palmtops, remote-control toys, portable televisions and photo flash units -- but is likely to see more arrivals in the next few years. 
Once you've grasped that much background, buying batteries is fairly simple: for low- and medium-powered equipment, standard alkalines offer the best power per penny. 
Battery selection for high-drain gear, however, is where the game gets interesting. In a typical digital camera, standard alkalines might last all of 30 minutes, as many a crestfallen consumer discovers. 
That's why some companies are touting something called premium alkalines -- reformulated batteries designed to last longer than standard alkalines in high-drain gadgetry. (The improvements include, as Duracell puts it, "proprietary separator material, enhanced cathode design and a high-power anode composition," just as you probably suspected.)
Duracell, for example, says that its premium battery, called Ultra, lasts up to twice as long as standard copper-tops in high-drain electronics. (Energizer's E2 line is also a premium alkaline, but Consumer Reports says it's not much more powerful than standard alkalines.) 
On the other hand, Ultra isn't as effective in medium- or low-drain electronics, offering an improvement of less than 50 percent, Duracell says, over standard alkalines. Any improvement is welcome, of course, but remember that Ultras cost about $1 apiece in a multipack, twice the price of store-brand regular alkalines. In other words, the convenience of Ultras is worth paying for in your Palm, television or digital camera but may be a waste of money in ordinary devices. 
But even premium alkalines can't power a digital camera for more than about 60 minutes of shooting, viewing and deleting pictures -- still not enough to last the whole day at Six Flags, let alone your two-week vacation. 
The final step up, therefore, is lithium batteries (not to be confused with lithium-ion laptop batteries) -- very expensive cells ($10 for four) that last five times as long as standard alkalines in high-drain electronics. Only Energizer makes AA lithiums. Duracell makes a lithium power pack called CV3 that looks like two AA batteries fused together, but it fits only certain digital camera models from Casio, Kodak and Olympus, for example, that have been designed to accept them.
If you use a high-drain device almost every day (this means you, palmtop and digital-photography addicts), the ultimate solution to the battery problem is nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries. Not only do they last even longer than premium alkalines, but for the ultimate in economy, you can recharge them 500 to 1,000 times by snapping them into a charger plugged into the wall. 
Rayovac's superb $30 charger (for AA, AAA and 9-volt sizes) rejuvenates drained NiMH's in one hour or less, a great improvement over previous chargers. (You'd think that engineers would have devised a shorthand for this battery's name, so they don't have to spend their days shouting, "Yo, Frank, should I put these nickel metal hydrides over on the nickel metal hydride shelf?" But they haven't.) 
The trouble with NiMH's is that they lose their charge over time -- about 15 percent per month. That makes them poor choices for long-term locations like remote controls, smoke detectors, digital cameras used only occasionally and, for that matter, the kitchen battery drawer. Some people keep one set in the charger and a second set in the camera, so they're always ready; but that's a lot of complication. At this point, rechargeables (including rechargeable alkalines, short-lived batteries that you can recharge only a few times) represent only 1 percent of battery sales. On the other hand, it's the fastest-growing battery category.
If you'd like to minimize complexity and maximize economy, then, the bottom line is this: Buy standard alkalines for everyday gadgets. Cheap store brands generally do just as well as big-name brands. In digital cameras, palmtops and other high-powered gizmos, buy rechargeable nickel metal hydrides (for gear you use daily) or Duracell Ultras (for gear you store between uses). 
Oh, and don't bother trying to conduct your own battery of tests.

When the Juice Runs Low (or Cold)
As it turns out, there's more to life with batteries than battery life. Here are some tips for smooth sailing:
* Don't put batteries in the refrigerator. Alkalines last at least seven years on the shelf at room temperature. A cold battery takes time to warm up before it's functional; worse, it sweats just like a can of cold soda. Do you really want moisture trickling into the guts of your $600 digital camera?
* They're still good. Just because a battery can no longer supply the power pulses required by digital cameras and flash attachments doesn't mean it's dead. Once removed from such high-drain devices, a battery still has plenty of juice for low-drain gadgets like clocks, remote controls and radios. 
* Don't mix old and new. Move those half-depleted cells straight into those clocks and radios. The problem with mixing old and new batteries in the kitchen drawer is that you risk inserting a mixed set into a device. Later, when the weakest battery dies, the electricity flowing through it from the newer batteries may make it leak, ruining both it and your appliance.
* Take them out for storage. If you won't be using a gadget for months, take out the batteries to avoid the same dying-and-leaking syndrome.
* It's O.K. to throw them away. Batteries haven't contained mercury since about 1993; Ric Erdheim, senior manager for government affairs at the National Electrical Manufacturing Association, says it is perfectly safe to toss them into your household trash. A few towns with incinerators still have battery collection days, a holdover from the mercury era, but they are fading away. Worn-out rechargeables are a different story, however. Take them to the collection buckets at chain stores like RadioShack and Circuit City. DAVID POGUE

HEADLINE: Phillips Group Shelves Plans For Gas Pipeline to Australia 

BYLINE:  By BECKY GAYLORD 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Phillips Petroleum and its partners will shelve plans to build a $500 million pipeline from gas fields under the Timor Sea to Darwin, Australia, because a tangle of legal and tax issues are unresolved, executives said today.
 The pipeline is considered crucial to development of the Bayu-Undan gas fields, whose estimated reserves of 3.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas are by far the most economically important resource belonging to East Timor. 
Phillips, the lead partner in the group developing the field, planned to distribute the gas in Australia, where demand is strong, and to process condensates from the gas into bulk products for shipment to Asia and the United States. 
 The group decided 18 months ago to go ahead with the project, but Australia and East Timor argued until last month over how to divide revenue from gas fields under the waters that separate them.
The problem now, Phillips executives said, is that issues thought to have been clarified at the outset, like tax rates, are back in flux. "We began it on the basis that the legal regime would continue for the life of the project," said Jim Godlove, Darwin area manager for Phillips. But East Timor is now talking about raising tax rates, costing Phillips and its partners "a lot more than $500 million," he said.
Australia's foreign minister, Alexander Downer, expressed disappointment at the Phillips decision and frustration with East Timor. "It's important for East Timor's standing in the international investor community that commitments made by the leaders of East Timor are adhered to," he said.
Mr. Godlove said the project would not move ahead until all the legal and financial issues were resolved "as a package."

PERSON: Martin Stern Jr. 

HEADLINE: Martin Stern Jr., 84, Architect, Dies; Redefined Vegas Skyline 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Martin Stern Jr., an architect who pioneered the eye-popping Googie-style coffee-shop architecture of Los Angeles and then brought his exuberant vision to the skyline of the Las Vegas strip, died on Saturday at a Los Angeles hospital. He was 84.
 Mr. Stern designed three Ships coffee shops in Los Angeles in 1956 and 1957 that joined the pantheon of what came to be called Googie architecture -- an enthusiastic cocktail of neon, modern design principles and clever signage. Preservationists protested mightily when the shops -- featuring distinctive orange color schemes and looking like rocket ships about to blast off -- were demolished during the 1980's and 90's. 
 Mr. Stern went on to design a significant part of Las Vegas's skyline, including a skyscraper and convention center at the Sahara Hotel and the MGM Grand Hotel, which became Bally's. He also designed the 26-story Mint Hotel.
He was part of the second generation of Las Vegas architects. Space had become more expensive, and the sprawling motel-like developments of earlier years no longer made economic sense. He and contemporaries like Wayne McAllister adapted by building hotels with towers that replaced neon signs as the defining elements.
"Gone was the sleek and low-slung intimacy of lounges, manicured lawns with rambling motel wings with private box balconies overlooking the pool with its beauties, replaced with a bigger, bolder and self-confident look of a legitimate corporate business," Peter Michel wrote on the Web site of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, to which Mr. Stern donated his architectural drawings. "There is much of the history of Las Vegas in the drawings of Martin Stern Jr.," Mr. Michel wrote.
Mr. Stern designed the Sahara Hotel's first skyscraper (14 stories) in 1959, its convention center in 1967, a 342-room high-rise addition in 1977 and a 625-room high-rise addition in 1979. He became known for his attention to the sort of details that make money. One trademark was the tower with the top floor wider than those below, to accommodate luxury suites with panoramic views. 
Steven Izenour, a Philadelphia architect and one of the authors of the 1972 book "Learning From Las Vegas," said Mr. Stern and his contemporaries "took the vocabulary of modern architecture and turned it into an ornamental style." He said Robert Venturi, who with Denise Scott Brown was a co-author of the book, called the approach "the architecture of the decorated shed."
Mr. Izenour argued that Mr. Stern's design has stood the test of time, calling it "wonderfully funky." He predicted that the Las Vegas style that succeeded that of Mr. Stern's generation -- huge theme parks modeled on New York City and other themes -- would fade, with Mr. Stern's style possibly making a comeback. He said, "In hindsight, it was a lot more sophisticated than people gave it credit for at the time."
Mr. Stern is survived by his wife, Chantal; three sons; a daughter; a sister; and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Pricewaterhouse Consulting Is Planning Further Layoffs 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
The consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers warned employees of another round of layoffs yesterday, primarily in its United States offices, affecting as many as 800 people, or 5 percent of its consultants and support staff.
 The move by PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the world's big accounting and consulting firms, is an effort to cut costs in response to sharply declining demand by clients for consulting services, Pricewaterhouse executives said. 
 Analysts said that while all consulting firms face difficult times, PricewaterhouseCoopers seems to be in a particularly awkward place. This is its second round of layoffs -- the first one in the spring affected about 1,000 employees -- and the direction of the consulting unit, which was almost sold to Hewlett-Packard late last year, is unclear. 
Mike Collins, managing partner of the Pricewaterhouse consulting arm for North America, said in a telephone interview yesterday: "Unfortunately, the costs of consulting have grown as a result of the strong economy of recent years, and have not yet been reset to reflect the current environment. We're basically doing the same thing we would tell our clients to do."
PricewaterhouseCoopers will reduce base compensation for both junior consultants and partners by 5 to 10 percent, Mr. Collins said. In addition, a greater portion of employees' salaries will depend on individual and team performance. The salary reductions and layoffs will take effect over the next few months.
The firm will also cut back recruiting efforts on college and business school campuses this fall, and has asked recent graduates who were to begin work in the fall to defer their starting dates. Pricewaterhouse will tell prospective employees by April 2002 whether and when they may start work, a spokeswoman said.
The changes are "reflective of PWC's position right now in the marketplace," said Tom Rodenhauser of Consulting Information Services in Keene, N.H. The PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting arm, he said, is not as big as Accenture or IBM Global Services, both technology services consultants, but is not a traditional division of an accounting firm, like Deloitte Consulting or Arthur Andersen's consulting business, either.
Some of the changes might also be preparation for a transaction involving the consulting business, several analysts said. Indeed, Pricewaterhouse's Mr. Collins said the firm still planned either a public offering for the consulting unit or a sale to an outside buyer, but he did not give a timetable. "We're not interested in doing a fast transaction if it's not the right transaction," he said.
Over all, the consulting business is suffering from the slowdown in the economy, which has led companies in a variety of industries to cut back spending. Growth in revenue at the 50 highest-grossing consulting firms fell last year to 11.7 percent from 19.7 percent in 1999, according to Kennedy Information, which tracks the industry, and consultants at several firms say privately that growth has fallen further this year.
"The big guys are all hemorrhaging," Mr. Rodenhauser said. "The business turned so sharply and they were caught with so much overcapacity that it was inevitable that they would have to cut."

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN; 
Ferrer Accents Message With Appeals to Different Audiences

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

 BODY:
 Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president and candidate for the Democratic nomination for mayor, is running two new television commercials -- one in English, one in Spanish. The English ad is scheduled to begin appearing today on English-language stations. The Spanish ad, which began yesterday, is being broadcast locally on Telemundo and Univision. 

English-Language Spot

PRODUCER -- Axelrod and Associates

ON THE SCREEN -- H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller and Democratic candidate for governor speaking and then black-and-white photographs of boarded-up buildings and trash-strewn streets. Then Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former congresswoman, speaking, followed by photos of Mr. Ferrer attending a groundbreaking with Mayor Edward I. Koch and cleaning graffiti off a building. Then Mr. McCall and Ms. Ferraro applauding Mr. Ferrer, who is shown last, talking with children, lecturing a room full of people and hugging a child with Puerto Rican flags in the background.

THE SCRIPT -- "When he started off in the Bronx, it was in terrible shape," Mr. McCall says. "It was the poster child for urban blight."
Ms. Ferraro: "Burned out buildings, buildings boarded up. Freddy rolled up his sleeves and went in and worked hard to make this borough live again."

Mr. McCall: "Freddy came from a place that was hopeless and helpless and he made something of himself and his community. His purpose will be to unite the city and to make sure that everybody shares in the great benefits New York has to offer."
Ms. Ferraro: "Freddy Ferrer is going to be a mayor for all New Yorkers."

ACCURACY -- Mr. Ferrer grew up in a less-than-affluent household in the South Bronx, went to college and now lives in Riverdale. The Bronx endured a period of fires, abandonment and devastation, and it has made an extraordinary comeback. The rebirth involved immigration, private investment and a costly commitment of public money. As borough president since 1987, Mr. Ferrer participated in the recovery, but other city officials and community groups generally receive the bulk of the credit.

SCORECARD -- The ad effectively introduces Mr. Ferrer to voters as a man who came from common roots and participated in the Bronx's revival. It also pushes a central theme of Mr. Ferrer's candidacy, that he intends to speak for voters in those parts of the city -- like the Bronx -- that he believes have been ignored. Finally, the commercial makes a pitch to black and Hispanic voters, upon whom Mr. Ferrer's mayoral ambitions hinge.

Spanish-Language Spot

PRODUCER -- Axelrod and Associates

ON THE SCREEN -- This ad opens with the National Puerto Rican Day Parade and a banner bearing Mr. Ferrer's name. Then images of Mr. Ferrer walking in the parade and waving to a crowd. Mr. Ferrer is shown talking with students and then hugging children. A group of singing children appear. The ad ends with Mr. Ferrer in a crowd, clasping his hands with others and raising them into the air. Campaign promises flash throughout the commercial: "After-school programs for all neighborhoods," "A certified teacher in every classroom," and "150,000 new homes at moderate prices."

THE SCRIPT -- A drum beat followed by a narrator: "He is leading the march to put a qualified teacher in each classroom, because education was the road that lifted him from poverty to public service. He is leading the march so that our children have after-school programs, like those that once saved him from the dangers of the streets. He is leading the march to build houses at moderate prices. Fernando Ferrer is one of us. And he will be the mayor of all New Yorkers."

ACCURACY -- Mr. Ferrer is a product of Roman Catholic parochial schools and says he attended two after-school programs while growing up in the South Bronx during a time of economic hardship. Like most of the other candidates, Mr. Ferrer has promised to raise the qualifications of New York's public school teachers. He has promised to restore an income tax surcharge that was recently reduced and to use the money for after-school programs in middle schools. And he has promised to oversee the construction of 150,000 new homes.

SCORECARD -- With Puerto Rican flags waving in the background, this commercial makes a direct appeal to New York's two million-plus Latinos. Unlike Mr. Ferrer's English-language commercial, this one assumes that its viewers already know him. The sentence "Fernando Ferrer is one of us" is a blunt appeal for ethnic solidarity. "He will be the mayor of all New Yorkers" plays up one of Mr. Ferrer's main themes -- that many people in the city, particularly blacks and Hispanics, have not fully benefited from New York City's economic growth.

HEADLINE: Vallone Asks Superintendents To Help Cut Board's Costs 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone said yesterday that Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy had ignored an agreement with the Council to cut administrative spending at the Board of Education. As a result, he is personally asking school district superintendents their ideas for cost savings at the board and budget priorities for the coming year.
 Mr. Vallone's comments were in the unusual form of a letter to the 40 superintendents who oversee the community and high school districts that make up the New York City school system and who report directly to Mr. Levy. 
 The letter states that Mr. Vallone is "working together with the Chancellor," but even some members of Mr. Vallone's staff said it was was a not-too-subtle rebuke of Mr. Levy. The letter is scheduled to be mailed today.
Karen Finney, a spokeswoman for Mr. Levy, said he planned to offer details of his proposed administrative cuts next week. Over the last month, Mr. Levy has complained loudly and frequently that the budget adopted in June by the City Council and the mayor leaves the school system with $120 million less to spend on classroom activities in the coming school year than it had in the year that just ended.
Yesterday, at a news conference with union leaders and members of school boards at Intermediate School 131 on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Mr. Levy said the expected adoption of a stripped-down budget by the State Legislature could force the Board of Education to cut even more than the $120 million he has asked the district superintendents to prepare for. That $120 million shortfall is based on an allocation from the city and on the governor's budget, which was proposed in January.
In Albany, Joseph Conway, a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, said that the Legislature's adoption of an austerity budget would make New York City's situation worse than it would have been if the governor's proposal had been adopted. He said the bare-bones budget that the Legislature is passing would give New York City only 16 percent of the governor's proposed $382 million statewide increase, rather than the 38 percent it would have gotten in the governor's original budget.
Mr. Vallone, as well as other City Council members and mayoral candidates, has expressed frustration that Mr. Levy has portrayed the Board of Education's budget as having been cut. In the letter, Mr. Vallone points out that the Board of Education's $11.5 billion budget actually includes a $183 million increase in city funds for the board.
Mr. Levy, however, has contended that because of inflation and mandated spending increases on salaries and other items, the school system is in fact left with $120 million less than it had last year. Mr. Levy has asked district superintendents to prepare plans for budget cuts should the Council or the state not increase financing for the school system later this year, which Ms. Finney said was part of the agreement with the Council to come up with cuts, which must be made by the end of the summer.
But Mr. Vallone said that "runs contrary to the Council's intent."
"In addition to the $183 million increase, the budget included a term and condition that requires the Board of Education to make a good-faith effort to generate administrative savings," Mr. Vallone stated in the letter. Once the board did so, "the Council would allocate additional funds for classroom instruction to supplement the original $183 million increase."

HEADLINE: Experts on Mexican Trucking Say Safety Issue Is Misleading 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
About 1,500 miles from this border city, on Capitol Hill in Washington, the prevailing wisdom is that unsafe, badly maintained Mexican trucks are about to invade the United States unless Congress maintains a ban that has kept Mexican truckers from traveling more than a few miles inside the border.
 But experts on both sides of the border say opponents of Mexican trucking, including the Teamsters union, have marshaled safety statistics that on close examination are misleading or incomplete. 
 There appear to be little or no data to prove that Mexican long-haul trucks and truckers are far more dangerous than their American counterparts, experts say.
The trucks that make the crossings along the 2,100-mile border with the United States are purposely older and less well-maintained vehicles used solely to travel the short distances from terminals on the Mexican side to depots on the American side. They would never be used for long hauls into the United States. 
Those short-haul trucks are often forced to idle at clogged crossings and by law cannot travel more than 20 miles beyond the border. The American opponents of Mexican trucking have cited safety statistics on those trucks -- 36 percent failed safety checks last year, according to the federal government -- to block attempts to lift the 20-mile limit.
In approving a $60 billion transportation bill, the Senate voted today to continue limits on Mexican trucks and imposed new safety and insurance restrictions on Mexican trucking businesses. President Bush has threatened to veto the measure because it would block his plan for Mexican trucks. Page A8. 
People pushing to lift the ban on Mexican trucks said the fight would resume next month if the new rules were not changed in a compromise with the House. The White House, which wants the prohibitions lifted, said the Senate vote would hurt chances of improving ties to Mexico. 
Mexican trucking owners dismiss the idea that they would send fleets of long-haul Mexican trucks roaming American roadways if Congress relented and the mileage limit and other rules that the Clinton administration unilaterally imposed on the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1995 are eliminated.
"That's not reality," said Roberto Quintanilla, president of CenSeCar, a large trucking company here in Nuevo Laredo, the gateway for 40 percent of the overland trade between Mexico and the United States. 
"Neither Mexican nor American trucking companies have the wherewithal to make a buck on the other side of the border," Mr. Quintanilla said. "Someday, it might be good business to do it. But the politicians up there should come down here, spend a day on the border, see what's going on, learn a little about Nafta."
Manuel Gomez Garcia, president of a Mexican trucking association, Canacar, said: "It's never going to make economic sense to send Mexican trucks to New York or Chicago. No way. It would be more practical for us to close up all our operations and reincorporate in the United States" -- and that is a highly unlikely prospect.
Since Nafta took effect in 1994, fewer than 2 percent of the trucking companies in Mexico have applied to do business in the United States. Only the best-run best-financed and most professional could do so profitably, Mexican and American businessmen and officials said.
"This argument has nothing to do with safety," said Jim Giermanski, for many years an academic expert on cross-border commerce who is director of international business studies at Belmont Abbey College in Belmont, N.C. "It has everything to do with politics and money."
The image of Mexican truckers painted in Washington is overblown, with the threat posed by thousands of illiterate peasants barreling down Interstates, behind the wheels of 40-ton tractor-trailers with bad brakes.
"There is going to be blood on the highway," said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon, one of hundreds of lawmakers who are trying to retain the mileage limit.
"Nafta is a trade pact," Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, said during a House vote five weeks ago. "It is not a suicide pact." 
The House voted to bar the Transportation Department from approving requests from Mexican truckers to operate in the United States.
In Mexico, as in the United States, there are two trucking businesses, long-haul companies that use newer, better-maintained vehicles, and short-haulers with more aged fleets who need to travel just short distances. "It's true that some of those trucks are in bad condition and that some of the operators don't have the best training," Mr. Gomez of the trucking group said. "But I know, and the Americans know better than to confuse the long-haul with the short-haul trucks."
Mexican products rolling into the United States arrive at a Mexican border depot on long-haul trucks. They are loaded onto short-haulers that go back and forth over the border between depots on each side. Finally, an American long-haul trucker takes the cargo from the American border depot to its United States destination. That makes at least three trucks to cross one line, although sometimes five are needed, experts said. The point of the Nafta provisions, Mexican and American officials said, was to streamline the process and cut costs.
"Everybody knows the movement of goods across the border today is immensely inefficient and so costly that it defeats Nafta's goals," said John Simpson, president of the Association of American Importers and Exporters and a former senior Treasury Department official.
In the Nafta debate in Washington, the foes of Mexican truckers relied on faulty Transportation Department figures that showed that 4.5 million Mexican trucks crossed into the United States in 1999. If a high percentage had safety problems, the opponents said, it stood to reason that great convoys of defective Mexican trucks would soon be crisscrossing the United States.
The Teamsters president, James P. Hoffa, said last month at a hearing that 36 percent of the Mexican trucks inspected on the American side of the border last year had something wrong with them, providing "a recipe for disaster." 
Because American trucks inspected throughout the United States, Mr. Hoffa said, have a 25 percent failure rate, Mexican truckers threatened the safety of American families, not to mention the jobs of law-abiding Teamsters.
In fact, the correct number of trucks that crossed the border in 1999 was 63,000, each making many trips across the border, the Transportation Department now says. 
They were short-haul trucks, making for an apples-and-oranges comparison with safety information. The one-quarter of American trucks that fail roadside inspections are overwhelmingly long-haul trucks, and not short-haul rigs, according to experts. 
By comparison, short-haul trucks that transport cargo to and from rail yards in Kansas City, Mo., have a failure rate of 45 percent, according to the Kansas City police.
The American trucking industry has its own safety problems. Accidents that involve heavy trucks have killed an average of 5,000 people a year for 15 years. Similar figures from Mexico are not available.
The Transportation Department has told Congress that "once the border is open to long-haul traffic, the number and percentage of safety-compliant Mexican trucks will dramatically increase, because long-haul trucks will be different from, and in better condition, than the shorter-haul trucks."
Even if the rules change to let long-haul Mexican truckers enter the United States, Mexican trucking companies would have to apply to the Transportation Department and meet United States legal standards to operate in the United States. 
Given the opportunity to apply, most Mexican trucking companies have declined. They would have to clear their practices with the Transportation Department, review their books with the Internal Revenue Service and pay federal, state, local and payroll taxes for the drivers.
"The fact is," Mr. Giermanski said, "if we open the border tomorrow, nothing will change. There's no way the Mexican long-haul trucker can drive willy-nilly around the United States."
Still, for Mario Galvan, a Mexican short-haul trucker who was waiting in the sun at Nuevo Laredo to cross the World Trade Bridge into Texas, the prospect of more open borders and open roads sounded enticing.
"It's a good idea," Mr. Galvan said. "I guess it all depends on whether the politicians in the United States see that we have the intelligence and cautiousness necessary to do the job."

HEADLINE: Blacks Hit by Housing Costs Leave San Francisco Behind 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
At 21 years old, Shanika Long is giving up on San Francisco, the city she was born and reared in and would rather still call home.
 Her mother tells her of a time when blacks owned certain parts of town, when the Fillmore District, for one, was a vibrant neighborhood with, she recalls, "a black-power-type mentality." 
 But, like the Fillmore's nickname, Harlem West, those days are history. And Ms. Long, a clerk at the Labor Ready agency for temporary workers who has a 3-year-old daughter, says she wants to live where black people can afford to buy houses and rear children. 
"I'm moving out and I'm feeling like I'm being pushed out of San Francisco," she said. "The community now is, like, dead." 
African-Americans, like Ms. Long, are leaving this city in droves. Over the last 10 years, as public housing and low-income projects have been torn down and as rents and house prices climbed to record levels, African-Americans have left San Francisco like no other city. 
Census figures show that while the city's overall population increased more than 7 percent in the 1990's, the number of people who list their race as black fell from 79,039 in 1990 to 60,515 last year (with an additional 6,561 reporting some black heritage combined with another race, the first time the census allowed people to check a mixed-race category). That leaves the city of 776,733 with a black population of 8.6 percent.
Other cities have had notable declines in their black populations over the last decade -- Washington, for example.
But blacks in other cities appear to be migrating to the suburbs in a pattern of upward mobility. In San Francisco, many are leaving because they have no choice. Gentrification during the dot-com boom gave the city the distinction as the most expensive in the country. 
Landlords in black neighborhoods, much like others, cashed in, raising rents and evicting long-term tenants. The recent technology bust has had little effect in lowering housing prices, real estate experts say. And since blacks have always been a relatively small minority here (13 percent of the population at its height in 1970) the consequences are striking.
The result, in one of the few major cities with a black mayor and a liberal political sensibility in sync with a majority of African-Americans, is a San Francisco with whole neighborhoods where it is rare to see a black person. It is a city where blacks have little clout, few cultural institutions and only one remaining neighborhood, the homely, lonely Bayview-Hunters Point, best known for a sewage treatment plant and radioactive Superfund site.
For many blacks here, San Francisco is the sweetheart who loved 'em and left 'em, who promised the moon and stars only to forget them when new blood came to town.
In the Fillmore, there has been much talk over the years of establishing a jazz district in honor of the jazz scene that emerged in the neighborhood from 1940 to 1950. It was the heyday of the community, when the black population of the city grew tenfold as thousands of blacks came to San Francisco looking for war jobs, many of them at the Navy shipyard at Hunters Point. But the jazz project has been in the planning stages for years with little action. 
In 1997, Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. promised to bring Bayview-Hunters Point thousands of jobs, a new stadium for the San Francisco 49ers and a megamall to go along with it. Voters approved the project in 1997, agreeing to finance it with $100 million in bonds. But the project was stalled when the 49ers owner, Eddie De Bartolo Jr., became embroiled in legal troubles and lost the team to his sister and her husband. The mall project is still in the talking stages.
Many blacks have little hope of things improving anytime soon. Even the black churches, the soul of the black community, have lost their influence. The Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor of the Glide Memorial Methodist Church, perhaps the sole remaining influential church, with more than 50 social and community programs, says that as blacks have moved, the churches have lost their base.
"Naturally, you're going to lose some of that vibrancy," said Mr. Williams, who blamed "economics, first and foremost -- the cost of living in this city" -- as the reason for the black exodus. His church is thriving, with more than 1,500 members of all races, many of whom drive from as far as Sacramento, 85 miles away. It also attracts busloads of tourists, drawn by the church's popular choir and band.
The mayor, through a spokesman, P. J. Johnston, said that not all blacks were leaving because they could not afford to stay.
"Those who would tell you it's simply a matter of poor people not being able to afford to live in this City obviously don't understand the black community, or the City of San Francisco,' Mr. Johnston said.
Some homeowners, he said, have sold their houses to cash in on the market and moved to more affordable cities. But, he conceded, lower-income renters "have had trouble keeping pace with this rise in housing costs, and many have moved to cheaper digs around the Bay Area."
Some are moving to working-class cities like Vallejo, Richmond or Fairfield, which have significant black populations and where it is still possible to buy a house for under $300,000. But census figures suggest that blacks appear to be bypassing Oakland, where African-Americans represent over a third of the population. In the last decade, that city, too, has seen a decline in its black population -- from 163,500 out of 399,500 residents in 1990 to 142,400 out of 372, 200 residents in 2000 -- as gentrification forced some low-income blacks to the further reaches of the area. 
Black-owned businesses in San Francisco have also left. Fred Jordan, a past president of the San Francisco Black Chamber of Commerce, said: "There used to be 138 African-American businesses along Fillmore Street. Last I heard there were 32 left and very hard to find."
One that remains is Perry's Joint, a coffee and candy shop, on Fillmore Street. Perry Bennett opened the shop eight years ago, hoping to buy into the neighborhood's history. But now only 15 percent to 20 percent of his customers are black, he said.
While the Fillmore has been losing blacks for decades -- federal urban renewal projects in the 1960's displaced thousands of blacks to make way for a boulevard and Japan Trade Center, shops and plazas -- Mr. Bennett started his business at a time when community leaders were talking revitalization. But even in the eight years that he has been around, Mr. Bennett said, he has watched dozens of businesses close and hundreds of customers move.
Like some other African-American business owners in the city, Mr. Bennett complains that blacks lack the unity and community spirit to achieve success here. "If we had that, in the Bayview-Hunters Point area," he said, "where blacks own all the homes, all the apartments and we had a black business district going all up and down Third Street, and we were a constituency that could put someone in office that is going to look out for our interests, we wouldn't be having this conversation." 
African-Americans do own most of the houses in Bayview-Hunters Point, but the prices of the modest starter house never kept pace with the rest of San Francisco's; homeowners who wanted to trade up were forced to leave the Bay Area to afford something better. 
Sophie Maxwell, a city supervisor who represents Bayview-Hunters Point, said projects in the works should improve the neighborhood. "Economic revitalization is what we're looking at," Ms. Maxwell said. "We're losing numbers so we're trying to identify and work on the assets in this community." 
The neighborhood's open space, parking places, vacant lots are all assets that developers are exploring, she said. 
Eric Martin, a 43-year-old salesman at the Record Shop in Bayview, said Asians, whose numbers are steadily climbing here, could teach blacks how to move forward.
"The Filipinos come in and they got five families living in one house," Mr. Martin said. "That's how they do it, how they can afford it. Then they buy the house, then they buy another house. They got unity. Brothers ain't like that. It used to be like that way back in the 60's and 70's."
The major obstacle to attracting new life has been the Navy shipyard, which brought so many thousands of blacks to San Francisco during the war. Since the Defense Department closed the shipyard in 1974, the neighborhood has been overshadowed by its aging hulking buildings, several of which are contaminated with radioactive waste.
Some see the toxic waste that has made Bayview-Hunters Point the subject of scorn and ridicule as the one reason the black population has not been pushed out of its stronghold. "It's what's killing this community and at the same time it may be preserving what we have," said Rebecca Logue Bovee, an organizer with the Housing Rights Committee.
Deborah Dean, a 41-year-old cashier at the Record Shop, sees the plans to redevelop Bayview as a plot to drive out blacks, because "blacks don't represent the white tourism image of the city."
"I live where you can hear the games from the new Giants ballpark and everything and you can see the lights," she said. "And it's just a beautiful view. If it wasn't for the toxic waste, they would have taken this hill a long time ago."

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about an exodus of black residents from San Francisco gave an incorrect surname in some copies for the former San Francisco 49ers owner whose legal troubles stalled development plans in a black neighborhood. He is Eddie DeBartolo Jr., not Bartolo. A map with the article referred incorrectly in some copies to a neighborhood where a jazz district has been proposed. It is the Fillmore, not Filmore.

HEADLINE: America's New Take on the World 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "America on the Sidelines" (editorial, July 29): 
 America suddenly seems like a very foreign country to the majority of Western Europeans. 
There is a growing sense of dismay at the Bush administration's aggressively negative tactics regarding international treaties and agreements on arms, pollution, trade and criminal justice. 
The violence of a small minority at the Genoa summit meeting should not distract from the fact that many Europeans traveled to Italy to protest World Trade Organization, World Bank and International Monetary Fund strategies that are perceived as serving American interests at the cost of further indebtedness for the world's poorest countries, as well as accelerating the ecological disaster that confronts our planet. 
Your editorial offers hope that Americans will petition their president to drop his gung-ho stance and enter into dialogue with a world that, while willing to accommodate his views, will not be bullied into swallowing them.

HEADLINE: An Old River Town Debates Modern Change 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: CATSKILL, N.Y. 

 BODY:
To contact a colleague, employees here at the hub of government in Greene County rely on couriers, since there is no e-mail and not enough telephone lines. To type reports, social workers in field offices drive nine miles to the nearest computer, then wait to use a pair of fax machines shared by 70 people. To make matters worse, they share their work space with skunks, raccoons and cockroaches who call the outdated government buildings home.
 Catskill is renowned as the longtime home of Thomas Cole, founder of the Hudson River School of landscape painting, and has been designated as a national historic district, but it may have too much history: it could be the most anachronistic county seat in the Hudson Valley. 
 But a potential solution to the problem, a new government office building, is encountering resistance from preservationists who fear that 21st-century amenities will obliterate 19th-century charms. 
The disagreement involves a proposed $14.7 million, four-story, 108,000-square-foot office building on Main Street and the 537 parking spaces it would require in several lots in the downtown area. According to county officials, the project would save taxpayers perhaps $2 million a year by consolidating more than a dozen offices under one roof and would generate millions more by rejuvenating a moribund downtown area. In addition, the project would, in one bold swoop, require the demolition of 11 existing structures that the project's advocates describe as eyesores that attract loitering youths.
"I think Main Street is like a medical patient," said William B. Lawrence, a Republican county legislator. "We're removing some discarded flesh, and we're putting in a new organ. But if they keep in the diseased organ, the patient is going to die."
In June, the County Legislature approved a $4.7 million bond issue for the project. Demolition was scheduled to start in the fall, and groundbreaking the following spring. But in July, a new citizens' group filed a lawsuit to block the project, arguing that the county did not adequately review the project's environmental and archaeological effect on the fragile historic district.
More recently, state conservation groups, including Scenic Hudson and the Preservation League of New York, have lined up against the project, too. 
"There aren't too many of these places left," said Scott P. Heyl, president of the Preservation League. "That's why this is so wrongheaded. Catskill is one of the more intact river towns in a very scenic area."
Located about 30 miles south of Albany and across the river from the reinvigorated city of Hudson, Catskill once served as a destination for weekenders from New York City, as well as a haven for artists. In the 1880's, a railway was built near the bustling dock to transport travelers to the Catskill Mountain House, the chief resort on the eastern slope of the Catskill Mountains.
As late as the 1960's, Catskill remained a modestly successful resort town, where residents could still shop for fresh food or clothing and find a decent restaurant meal. But like so many other upstate towns, Catskill lost industry -- its lingerie and thermostat factories -- and its downtown was eviscerated by the growth of bland shopping malls nearby. In a stunning symbol of the village's deterioration, New York State bought the Catskill Mountain House in 1963, which had been long since abandoned, and burned it down.
A few government offices that had been providing unemployment, legal, agricultural or social services left, moving across the river to Columbia County. The village remained the county seat, but the downtown became a lonely 9-to-5 place occupied by lawyers, the remaining government employees and nonprofit workers, who ate and shopped in malls. 
"You couldn't get a cup of coffee on Main Street," said Douglas J. Brewer, the Greene County administrator. "You couldn't get a tie or men's underwear."
During the 1990's, however, Greene County's population increased by 7.7 percent, one of the fastest rates in the state, fueled in part by commuters who make the trip to Albany or New York City on the New York State Thruway. And yet, anyone with official county business still confronted an inefficient infrastructure, Sisyphean in its futility.
The County Legislature, which occupies a former car dealership, has so little space that its main conference room doubles as the site for civil service examinations. To accommodate its different agencies, the county rents space in more than a dozen buildings. This means extra expenses for security, insurance, maintenance contracts and jobs, Mr. Brewer said.
In some offices, there are so many telephone wires and extensions criss-crossing overhead that the offices appear to be decorated with Christmas wiring, minus the lights. But the tangle of wires is deceptive. "Employees use personal cell phones because there aren't enough phones in the office," said Carol W. Wallace, the county's social services commissioner. "They're so frustrated."
So this year, the County Legislature approved a proposal for a new building that would house 350 employees on the site of the defunct Newberry's department store. Of the $14.7 million earmarked for the project, $7 million would come from New York's share of the national tobacco settlement, $3 million would come from the county budget and the rest from the bond issue.
In hopes of not violating the requirements for national historic districts, the building's architectural design would echo that of the downtown, and would not be a "glass and chrome" suburban box, Mr. Lawrence assured. 
While the downtown is dressed up with green banners that proclaim "Historic Catskill," many of its buildings, including some of those scheduled for demolition, are empty and rickety, their faded Italianate facades reminders of better days. Inside are dilapidated and overcrowded apartments that have attracted transient youths looking for cheap rents and minimum-wage jobs.
But these buildings also convey a sense of history. One, a former church built in 1841, was designed by Cole himself and remains one of his few extant structures. Most of the others scheduled for demolition are more than 100 years old, adorned by architectural flourishes like decorative roof cornices and curved pediments. 
David Seamon, a part-time resident who is an environmental psychologist at Kansas State University, supports a new county office building, in principle. But his new citizens' group, Save Our Main Street Buildings, has been troubled by the proposal's parking plans, which his group says would create an unappealing asphalt moat around the new building. And it is particularly unhappy that officials are proposing to tear down three buildings to create only nine parking spaces. So the group has urged the county to look at other empty lots and nonhistoric sites farther away from the downtown strip.
As a national historic district, Catskill is subject to extra requirements encouraging the preservation of all structures. But according to Mr. Seamon, the county has pushed the project through in a hasty and irresponsible fashion. In addition to doing a shoddy environmental review, it quietly managed to limit the time for public response to 20 days from 30, he said. His group found out in time to file its suit just before the deadline in mid-July. So far, the county has not responded to the suit, but a court hearing is scheduled for mid-August, Mr. Lawrence said. 
More than any legal particulars, however, Mr. Seamon is concerned that the parking lot would derail the village's nascent attempts to emphasize its past. These efforts include the refurbishing of Catskill Point, a riverfront museum and park about a mile from downtown. 
Even so, Mr. Seamon said, he couldn't escape a sense of dread during a recent celebration of the village's latest achievement: the restoration of a building where Thomas Cole lived, in honor of his 200th birthday. "It seems so ironic that we were all standing there, and the politicians were talking about how wonderful that Cole's building had been saved." 
Then, turning his attention to the former church Cole designed, Mr. Seamon said, "Yet here we are, about to destroy his building."

GUARD, SARAH ("SALLY")

 BODY:
 GUARD-Sarah ("Sally"). Sally died peacefully July 28 at St. Vincent's Hospital with her husband, David Burger, at her side. Their daughters, Emma and Cameron, were at home nearby with Sally's mother, Gretchen, and her aunt, Sarah Ballard. Born January 26, 1963, near Sydney, Australia, Sally was the daughter of Gretchen, a painter currently of Santa Fe, NM, and the late David Guard, a founding member of The Kingston Trio. Along with her sister, Catherine, and brother, Tom, Sally grew up in Whale Beach, Australia, and in Palo Alto and Portola Valley, CA. She went to Woodside High School and spent spent summers at the Bar 717 Ranch in Trinity County, CA. In 1980, Sally headed to Middlebury College, where she would play varsity soccer, major in English, study French and Italian, and play saxophone in the Ripton Blues Band. After graduating in 1984, she became a reporter at Sports Illustrated in Manhattan, covering golf and the Winter Olympics, as well as soccer, the sport she loved most. She met David, now an economist and senior analyst at Moody's, in a guitar class at The New School in 1993, and they were married 2 years later. Sally was a senior editor when she left Sports Illustrated in 1995, shortly before Emma was born, then an editor at Bishop Books until Cameron arrived in 1998. After that, she devoted her time to her girls and to David, with whom she found enormous joy and fulfillment. 
She will be remembered for her wit, her artful turn of phrase, her letters, her love of music, language and arts, her honesty, generosity, and for her commitment to family and friends. She was a unique and loving soul, and will be deeply missed. A memorial service will be held at The Orensanz Foundation for the Arts, 172 Norfolk St, NYC on Saturday, August 11, at 1PM. Contributions in her memory may be made to The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, 475 Park Ave So., 21 Fl, NY, NY 10016. Please include Sally's name and that acknowledgement should be made to David Burger, 50 Walker St, Apt 4B, NY, NY 10013.

HEADLINE: Domestic Auto Sales Fell 6% in July 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Auto sales in the United States fell 6 percent in July as the slowing economy and the continued struggles of domestic automakers dampened sales.
 The falloff from figures in the month a year earlier comes after a surprisingly strong first half of the year that surpassed expectations. 
 But many analysts said generous incentive programs by domestic carmakers, which lifted sales early in the year, could come at the expense of sales in the second half. The strong dollar is also making it easier for foreign automakers to offer their own incentives. 
"It looks like sales have definitely slipped and shifted into a lower gear," said Stephen J. Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. "Marketing costs at Ford and General Motors were at record levels in the first half of the year. They pumped so much money at the market that they pulled up demand, but you can't keep doing that forever."
Paul Ballew, the general director of global market and industry analysis at General Motors, said today, "There are clear signs of moderation."
"In general," he added, "what we're seeing is an industry, consistent with the overall softening in the economic expansion, that is heading toward a healthy year, but a year that's down from the record levels in 1999 and calendar year 2000."
The auto industry posted record sales of 17.8 million vehicles in the United States last year. This year, most analysts expected sales around 16.5 million. In June, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales was 17 million vehicles. In July, that fell to 16.2 million, compared with 17.1 million in the month a year earlier, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data service in Southfield, Mich.
"We're seeing the first signs that the numbers we saw in the first half were unsustainable," said Saul Rubin, an analyst at UBS Warburg. "Most analysts had been expecting a slowdown, we're just finding it occurred later than we imagined."
Auto sales are a closely watched economic indicator because they give a sense of consumer demand early in the month and because they make up such a large part of the nation's overall production. Much of the sales slowdown in July came at the expense of the Ford Motor Company, G.M. and the Chrysler Group division of DaimlerChrysler, which all continue to lose market share to foreign rivals.
"There are many foreign brands that are expanding their product lineups, competing in segments where they didn't formerly compete," said George Pipas, Ford's manager of sales analysis. He was referring partly to the aggressive movement of companies like Toyota Motor into the sport utility market.
"A new one this month is Kia Sedona, the new minivan, a segment that they have not competed in in years past," he added, referring to Kia Motor, the Korean automaker, now owned by Hyundai Motor. By comparison, he said, Ford already made a broad range of vehicles and did not have the growth opportunity of entering a new market. It was sluggish car sales, however, that particularly hurt Ford and G.M. in July. One reason is that foreign automakers, emboldened by attractive exchange rates, are starting to offer incentives on some of their popular cars.
"Japan and Korea have fresh products, and they have attractively priced currencies, which gives them pricing flexibility," said John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. "Right now, there are pretty attractive deals on the Camry and the Accord, two blue-chip vehicles" from Japan. 
Ford's auto sales decreased 12.8 percent in the United States in July, and its Mercury and Jaguar brands each fell a little more than 25 percent, compared with figures a year earlier. The company, which is still trying to get past its dispute with Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. over tires that have been linked to rollovers of the Explorer, recently shifted its management structure and gave William C. Ford Jr., its chairman, a greater say in the company. 
One bright spot for the company was the performance of its Volvo subsidiary, which reported a 31.2 percent increase in sales.
G.M.'s sales fell 9.1 percent in July as sales of cars dropped 19 percent, compared with a 2 percent increase in truck sales. The company said it would produce 1.23 million vehicles in North America in the third quarter, about 5,000 fewer than previously planned, because of the slowing market and overproduction in the second quarter. 
Sales at Chrysler fell 3 percent, though sales of its new Jeep Liberty increased 24 percent compared with figures in June.
Toyota's sales in the United States increased 5.8 percent. Sales at Honda Motor fell 6.1 percent, while sales at BMW increased 26 percent and sales at Hyundai increased 32 percent, driven partly by its new Santa Fe sport utility vehicle.
"The industry is wrestling with moderating demand in an intensely competitive environment," said Mr. Ballew of G.M. "The domestic manufacturers are certainly under a degree of pressure, and we expect that to continue into next year."

HEADLINE: Cigna Falls Short of Estimates; Oxford to Cut Growth Forecast 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Managed care health insurance companies are feeling the effects of rising medical costs and the economic slowdown -- and they are not good. 
 The Cigna Corporation, one of the nation's largest health insurers, said yesterday that it had failed to meet its earnings goals in the second quarter as medical costs continued to outrun the company's projections. 
 Oxford Health Plans, the big New York metropolitan area health maintenance organization, reported a strong quarter after rebounding from a brush with financial disaster several years ago. But Oxford, based in Trumbull, Conn., said it was trimming back its expectations for growth as the economy weakens. 
Cigna shares plunged $13.66 yesterday, or more than 13 percent, to $86.65, on the New York Stock Exchange after the company fell short of analysts' forecasts for the second consecutive quarter and several lowered their ratings on the stock. Oxford declined $1.98, to $27.02.
Analysts said Cigna, of Philadelphia, had been losing market share among big employers to the UnitedHealth Group, which has been quicker to offer a looser brand of managed care with more choices for subscribers. Cigna's overall enrollment rose 2 percent, to 14.29 million patients, still slightly lower than it was last December. Membership in the company's health maintenance organizations dropped, though its own looser networks gained members.
William McKeever, a health care analyst at UBS Warburg, said Cigna was not losing business but was not growing at rates equivalent to United, of Minnetonka, Minn., or Wellpoint Health Networks, of Thousand Oaks, Calif.
Profit from Cigna's operations fell 6 percent, to $262 million, or $1.73 a share, in the second quarter, from $279 million, or $1.71, excluding after-tax gains and charges associated with the sale of a reinsurance unit last year. Cigna had been expected to earn $1.77 a share. 
Both Cigna and Oxford said that specialists had been ordering more tests and procedures. Cigna said its medical costs would increase 12 percent to 13 percent.
Oxford said hospital admissions rose. Spending for prescription drugs is increasing in the 20 percent range, said Dr. Norman C. Payson, Oxford's chief executive.
Oxford said its quarterly net income was $74.8 million, or 73 cents a share, up from $44.5 million, or 44 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose $100 million, to $1.11 billion. 
Enrollment in H.M.O.'s for employee groups increased by 10,000 patients, to 1.37 million in the quarter, compared with 1.05 million the year before. Total membership, including Medicare and health plans administered for self-insured employers, was 1.51 million. 
Among the three largest for-profit health insurers, Cigna and Aetna have been losing market share to the United Healthcare unit of the UnitedHealth Group, especially among large, self-insured employers, said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a managing director at the Carlyle Group, a private investment fund. He said Cigna and United each covered about 10 million people in the self-insured market. Aetna covers about 8 million.
Dr. Payson said employers had become "much more price-sensitive" as the economy weakened. Oxford, like several other managed care companies, is offering health plans that transfer a larger share of costs to employees, through bigger copayments. 
Smaller employers, especially in New York, are adopting "three-tier" drug plans that offer lower prices for generic drugs and brand-name drugs on an approved list, he said, while charging consumers a larger share of the cost of products not on the list. Large employers and companies based in New Jersey and Connecticut have been slower to adopt this type of drug plan, Dr. Payson added.

HEADLINE: The Power of Roundup; 
A Weed Killer Is a Block For Monsanto To Build On

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS 

 BODY:
Monsanto jumped headfirst into the future five years ago, when it spun off its old-line chemicals business and rechristened itself a "life sciences" company that used biotechnology to develop genetically altered crops.
 After investing billions in that vision -- some of it to create bioengineered corn, soybeans and other crops, and some to buy large seed companies -- Monsanto is prospering. But not because of any proliferation of genetically modified supercrops, which have been widely accepted in the United States but have come under fire in Europe and Japan. 
 What keeps Monsanto healthy is Roundup, a chemical herbicide developed more than two decades ago. It is the best-selling agricultural chemical product ever, with $2.8 billion in sales last year; it outsells other chemicals five to one. 
The growth of Roundup, which accounts for about half of Monsanto's revenue, is the primary reason that the company reported a solid profit in the second quarter, despite the resistance overseas to bioengineered crops and a depressed agriculture economy that has battered other companies.
Monsanto has maintained and even souped up Roundup's status by forging what analysts say was a brilliant strategy of dropping its price years ahead of patent expiration and tying its use to the early growth of genetically modified crops -- crops made to work in tandem with the herbicide.
"It was a classic pricing strategy," said Leslie Ravitz, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. "It was a textbook case. Every 1 percent price drop led to a 2.5 or 3 percent increase in volume."
Monsanto still faces challenges. Roundup's lower price and global dominance mean that it faces difficult growth prospects. And if consumers and regulators here and abroad reject biotech crops, Monsanto and its multibillion-dollar investments would be devastated.
But analysts say the company seems to be positioning Roundup as a hedge against that possibility. And if biotechnology is not dealt a significant blow, Monsanto could become the world's most profitable agriculture company because it would then command 80 percent to 90 percent of its two primary markets -- nonselective herbicides and biotechnology seeds. The combination, analysts say, could lead both product lines to reinforce each other, helping Monsanto's seeds dominate certain crops in the same way Roundup does in herbicides.
Even competitors marvel at the growth and size of Roundup. "This is a blockbuster in an industry where a blockbuster is a $200 million product," said Jerome Peribere, vice president for herbicides at Dow AgroSciences. "In pharmaceuticals, a blockbuster is $1 billion; this is like imagining a $10 to $15 billion product."
That is why analysts project double-digit growth for Monsanto over the next few years. It would be a remarkable turnaround for a company whose profits had been weighed down by huge research costs and by the debt that came with buying seed companies in the 1990's. That debt, about $6 billion, helped push Monsanto into a merger with the Pharmacia Corporation in 1999.
Pharmacia swallowed up Monsanto's drug unit, Searle, and its Celebrex arthritis drug -- then spun off Monsanto as a separate company after investors complained that Monsanto would weigh down Pharmacia's profits. But since Monsanto's initial offering in October, its shares have jumped about 82 percent. Shares of Pharmacia, which still owns 85 percent of Monsanto, have fallen about 19 percent.
Investors have reacted to two trends: the company's biotechnology seeds are now planted on about 80 million acres worldwide. And Roundup commands 80 percent of the world market in herbicides that do not target specific weeds.
Even more, few competitors are willing to produce a generic version of Roundup, a glyphosate herbicide that kills just about anything green, because Monsanto has protected its market dominance by cutting the price while finding new uses. This built loyalty while reducing the profit that potential competitors could reap by trying to lure away customers.
For example, in 1996 Monsanto began marketing genetically modified crops that were immune to Roundup. The crops, called "Roundup Ready," allow farmers to spray the herbicide on the fields, killing weeds but not the crops.
The company also lowered the retail price of Roundup years before its patent expired in 2000 -- dropping it from about $44 a gallon in 1997 to $34 in 1999 to about $28 today. This drove up demand and may have also deterred competitors. At the same time, profits did not suffer; volume gains made up for the price cuts.
"If you look at the period 1994 to 2000, the price decreased 45 percent but our gross profit was up 90 percent," said Hugh Grant, the chief operating officer at Monsanto, which is based here.
Roundup also helped speed the adoption of conservation tillage, a system where farmers do not weed and till the soil before planting; they simply spray weed killer and then plant. Con-till, as it is known, reduces soil erosion, saves fuel and eases wear and tear on farm equipment, not to mention lowering labor costs. 
The tillage method is used on about 300 million acres worldwide, and Roundup is used on about two-thirds of those acres.
Monsanto also decided that once its United States patent expired, it would supply its glyphosate molecule to competitors. The drop in the price of Roundup and the size of Monsanto's volume -- it produces close to 160 million gallons a year -- seemed to deter competitors from building plants because the economics make it difficult to compete.
"They said, 'We'll license you the molecule, and you can buy it, repackage it, do whatever you want. Or you can build your own plant.' " said Jeffrey Peck, an analyst at Bear Stearns. "Just about every company they offered it to took the deal."
Monsanto extended its advantage by sharing its regulatory clearances with companies that buy the ingredient from Monsanto rather than make it themselves. That sped up government approval.
The world's biggest agricultural seed and chemical company, Syngenta, which was formed last year when Novartis and AstraZeneca combined their agrochemical businesses, has begun to make a glyphosate molecule, but its market share is small. Another competitor, Dow AgroSciences, has set the modest goal of being No. 2 in the market, with 10 percent of glyphosate sales.
Some companies are fighting Monsanto in court. The DuPont Company has filed two lawsuits in federal courts accusing Monsanto of violating antitrust laws by linking the sale of Roundup and Roundup Ready crops and by using incentives and requirements to lock out rivals.
"The pressure Monsanto puts on dealers and distributors makes it very difficult for competitors to sell their own glyphosate products, even when those products are cheaper than Roundup," said John Hinderaker, a lawyer who represents Dupont. A spokesman for Monsanto said the Dupont case is "absolutely without merit."
In any case, analysts said it would be hard to compete with Monsanto on price because it could always cut the cost of the herbicide and make up the difference by raising prices for Roundup Ready seeds. Such seeds, which are protected by patents, account for almost 70 percent of the 70 million soybean acres in the United States.
"They take a lot of the price out of the herbicide but probably put it in the seed," said Ian Heap, who heads the International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds in Corvallis, Ore. "And that gets a lot of companies out of the herbicide market."
The question is whether such strategies will continue to pay off. Analysts are betting yes, but there are obstacles. Adoption of the con-till method could slow. And Roundup could be nearing a saturation point -- or at least a point where sizable growth is difficult, analysts say.
Industry executives agree. "The problem with Monsanto today is volumes have grown tremendously because of price elasticity, but this growth is coming down," said Mr. Peribere at Dow AgroSciences. "One has to ask whether the horse is out of the barn."
Still, analysts say Monsanto looks substantially better than it did two years ago. The company was reincarnated with a better balance sheet after the Pharmacia spinoff. It sold divisions, cut costs and trimmed its biotechnology ambitions.
Instead of trying to develop biotech versions of a dozen or more crops, it has focused on four: corn, soybeans, wheat and cotton.
Monsanto is pumping about $600 million a year in research and development, far more than any rival. The company knows that Roundup is its past, and perhaps its present. But it is counting on biotech to be the profit generator of the future.
Though costly to research and bring to market, biotech seeds generate large profits once they are licensed. This year, Monsanto is expected to bring in about $400 million from its biotech traits -- the technology implanted in seeds to make a plant release an insecticide or resist weed killer.
But do not underestimate the power of Roundup, analysts say. "As the price of Roundup goes down, it's going to open up even more markets," said Andrew Cash, an analyst at UBS Warburg. "Roundup is a blockbuster right now, and it'll get even bigger."

HEADLINE: A Singapore Bank Apology Blames Goldman, Sachs 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Singaporeans awoke today to a startling act of public contrition in their morning newspapers.
 The Development Bank of Singapore published letters to two rival Singapore banks, United Overseas Bank and Overseas Union Bank, apologizing for having suggested they were guilty of cronyism. The Development Bank, known as DBS, and owned by the government-controlled DBS Group Holdings, had made the accusation in a presentation to investors about why its hostile bid for Overseas Union was superior to the two banks' friendly merger deal. 
 "I can understand how you feel, and apologize, on behalf of DBS and my board members, unreservedly for the distress the statements must have caused you," S. Dhanabalan, the DBS Group chairman, wrote. 
The letters, and the compensation of 1 million Singapore dollars ($554,000) paid to each bank by DBS, would normally be a minor tempest in the tidy world of Singaporean finance. But DBS went on to ascribe a good bit of the blame for the statements to Goldman, Sachs & Company, which has been advising DBS on its takeover campaign.
Suddenly, the squabble among three hometown banks has mutated into something else: a case study in the perils of bringing bare-knuckle American tactics to the genteel boardrooms of Asia.
"In the U.S. and Europe, mudslinging is a normal part of the process in a takeover battle," said David M. Webb, editor of Webb-site.com, which tracks deals in Asia. "But it's a culture shock in Singapore to have that kind of debate about management styles and motivations."
Goldman's aggressive approach has landed it in trouble before in the region. In 1999, the firm apologized to the government of Thailand for a report by one of its analysts that quoted the finance minister criticizing a major Thai bank (the minister denied making the remarks).
Last year, Goldman was stung when its sales representatives sent an unauthorized e-mail message to investors with claims about the stock offering of China's state-owned oil company, PetroChina Ltd. Because the firm feared some of the claims might have violated securities laws, it reprinted the message -- and corrected parts of it -- in the prospectus for PetroChina.
A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment on the latest case, saying, "We never discuss matters involving our clients."
Singapore's strict defamation laws, famous for bankrupting the nation's few opposition political leaders, can be wielded with similar effect against commercial foes. Executives close to the dispute said United Overseas made a veiled threat to sue DBS if it did not withdraw statements contained in a document prepared by Goldman and distributed to DBS shareholders in Europe.
Among them were assertions by DBS that a merger of United Overseas and Overseas Union would be hobbled by "decision paralysis and infighting"; that the merged bank's board and management would comprise "friends and family"; and that the deal was intended to protect the family that controls Overseas Union at the expense of public shareholders, who own 85 percent of its outstanding shares.
"One certainly has to applaud the U.O.B. offer," the advisers from Goldman, Sachs added. "Not for its economic sense, but for its daring; especially as this combination is designed to keep family control intact without regard for shareholder value."
Such criticisms are hardly new in Asia, where hundreds of companies could fairly be faulted for favoring family owners over public shareholders. Nor are harsh words rare in takeover battles on other continents, where combatants often publicly belittle rivals and their offers.
But they are unheard-of in the cozy club of Singapore finance, which is dominated by the government-controlled DBS and banks like Overseas Union and United Overseas, founded by ethnic Chinese families.
Defenders of Goldman say that in a roundabout way, the firm was merely carrying out the wishes of the Singapore government. Alarmed by the global consolidation in banking, Singapore has called for its own banks to merge into a handful of big regional players.
In April, DBS purchased a Hong Kong bank, Dao Heng, for $5.4 billion. In late June, it made an unsolicited $5.2 billion offer for Overseas Union, one of the first in Singapore's history. A week later, United Overseas, Singapore's No. 2 lender, topped that bid, offering $5.5 billion and noting that it was supported by Overseas Union's founder, Lien Ying Chow.
DBS said on Monday that it would not be drawn into a bidding war, which means that the battle is probably over. For Goldman, the wages of defeat may be bitter. DBS declined to say whether it had dismissed the firm, and the other two banks would not comment beyond issuing letters accepting the apology.
But Goldman's rivals are gloating over the black mark the episode seems to have given it among Singapore's business elite -- their glee muted somewhat by the thought that they, too, could one day be caught in similar cultural crosswinds.
"I think Goldman is probably the best investment bank in the world," said William H. Overholt, the chief Asian strategist at Nomura International. "But their job is to understand the local business culture."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
The mainstream can't or won't recognize some basic facts about world poverty.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and a collection of essays, "Unconventional Wisdom: Alternative Perspectives on the New Economy." E-mail:challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
THERE has been little headway made in the fight against world poverty in the last decade. Yet when Group of 8 leaders met in Genoa, Italy, two weeks ago, they chastised protesters with warnings that they would only obstruct progress for the poor.
 Considering the facts, that was quite a display of arrogance. The World Bank calculates that a third to a fourth of the world's people still live in severe poverty -- and this is based on minimal rates of $1 to $2 a day. The overall proportion has fallen only slightly the last 10 years, and poverty levels have risen in many countries. Moreover, in poor regions, except Asia, income inequality has widened. 
 The insensitivity to the stunning facts is not limited to Western leaders. Mainstream economists have been notable for their silence. At the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, a weekend seminar was held in June on the Clinton administration's economic policies. Yet hardly a word of criticism was raised about the Treasury's heavy-handed advocacy of the rapid liberalization of capital flows, which many mainstream economists now concede contributed to the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, sending many into poverty.
Today, Argentina and New Zealand, once models for the liberalizing policies so widely encouraged by economists and global investors, are in serious trouble. Argentina, which linked its currency to the dollar in 1991, amid plaudits from disciplinarians, totters on the brink of a financial crisis that could sweep up Brazil as well. New Zealand's growth rates are among the worst in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Yet there is little public outcry about mistaken policies.
In June, a small dissenting group of international economists and political scientists met to discuss this absence of a full public discourse. The conference was organized by two Harvard professors, Dani Rodrik, an economist at the Kennedy School, and Roberto Unger, a law professor. In the spring, the two had taught a standing-room-only course at Harvard Law School on alternative development strategies.
The participants essentially found themselves up against a wall. Nations have little leeway to adopt policies that deviate from those accepted by institutions like the International Monetary Fund or those demanded by the financial markets. If they do, capital flees, interest rates rise and loans are not renewed.
But the truly regrettable paradox is that the strategies advocated by the economic and financial mainstream -- reduced government spending, privatization, unrestricted capital flows and completely free trade -- are not the policies that gave rise to the rapid growth of developing nations in the recent past. Had South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand or Brazil been restricted to the policies considered acceptable today, they would not have been such success stories.
As Mr. Rodrik points out, Taiwan and South Korea adopted aggressive industrial policies to subsidize crucial industries. Many of the fastest-growing nations owned and ran major industries and protected infant industries with high tariffs. Government investment in education was often strong in these nations. Most slowly depreciated their currencies, rather than adopt the floating currencies advocated today (or the fixed-currency regime used by Argentina). In sum, these nations integrated their economies with the advanced world -- not right away, but only when they had matured and grown more prosperous.
Moreover, not only are successful policies often abandoned, but as the current plight of Argentina and New Zealand suggests, liberalizing policies often fail, too. Robert Wade, a political scientist at the London School of Economics, argues that few nations that were largely dependent on commodity exports, like New Zealand, have been able to transform themselves into successful producers of advanced goods based on such policies.
For Mr. Wade, such a transformation still requires an industrial policy. At times, to take one example, it may require an import-substitution policy of high tariffs to protect developing domestic industries. But such policies were widely criticized as the main source of failure in Latin America in the 1980's. Mr. Wade counters that it was the indebtedness of many Latin American nations that created crises and poor growth in the 1980's, not import substitution, and that the establishment has essentially twisted the argument in its favor.
Neither Mr. Wade nor Mr. Rodrik, whose most recent book is "The New Global Economy and Developing Countries: Making Openness Work" (Overseas Development Council, 1999), says he thinks there is one policy to fit all sizes. Import substitution may be appropriate to some, but not others. Both argue strongly that local conditions should be allowed to determine the right course, not international institutions with universal formulas.
To Mr. Unger, however, the author of "Democracy Realized: The Progressive Alternative" (Verso Books, 1998), only more sweeping change has a chance to work. Mr. Unger proposes not so much a blueprint but a profoundly new direction that includes high levels of government investment and taxes, required voting and forced savings to buffer states from the influence of international investors.
Mr. Unger says his ideas have certainly not caught on among the establishment, but he is attracting a lot of interest from the younger generation. Given the levels of poverty, this is no surprise.
Yet the protesters in Genoa and elsewhere also naively denigrate the value of economic growth. Mr. Wade, for example, points out that there is no evidence that local participation in devising economic strategies, so widely advocated by protesting groups, will provide an answer to alleviating poverty unless it is accompanied by other pro-growth strategies.
What is surely the case, however, is that if nations remain under the thumb of single-minded international investors and their institutional surrogates, there will be little room for new ideas. Mr. Rodrik says the financial turmoil in Turkey, for example, has been made worse by the immediate demands by institutions for liberalization. Mr. Wade says serious industrial policy is hard to undertake in current circumstances.
To mitigate the power of the financial markets requires leadership from the powerful themselves. But such leadership is absent not only in Washington and most other Western capitals but also in America's major academic centers.

HEADLINE: Swelling Shelters 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
For weeks, city officials, advocates for the homeless and landlords have been holding meetings in a conference room at a Manhattan courthouse, trying to overcome some of the longstanding bureaucratic obstacles that stand between the homeless families crowding the city's shelter system and apartments they can afford.
 No one disputes the urgency of the problem. The number of homeless families in city shelters is at a record 6,252, including 11,594 children, and growing. In June alone, city officials say, 1,593 families applied for shelter, 31 percent more than in the same month a year ago. 
 No one disputes that the city is applying more energy to finding permanent housing for such families than it has in years. Barbara Cutler, the court-appointed special master who has overseen the city's operation of the family shelters for seven years, said she has never seen so many city commissioners come to the table, all trying to mend fences with landlords who could hold the key to housing for hundreds of the families now stuck in the shelters.
But with little to show so far, a larger debate underlies the week-to-week effort to find a quick fix to a problem that everyone fears will reach a new crisis point by winter: Could the crisis have been avoided?
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended his administration's record on handling the homeless yesterday. He said fewer families had been able to leave the shelters for permanent housing because 2,300 new housing units that the city wanted to build on the sites of community gardens were being held up by the state attorney general and activists.
"The gardens were temporary," Mr. Giuliani said. "Now the people don't want to give the gardens back. So that is holding up more than enough units that could satisfy the increase right now."
Advocates for the homeless, who have been locked in legal combat with the administration for years over its homeless policies, scoff at that explanation. They say they have long been warning that the administration was failing to provide the low-cost housing and rental subsidies necessary to move families from expensive shelters to homes.
"For seven and a half years, the city has resisted that in court," said Steven Banks, the lawyer for the Coalition for the Homeless and director of the Homeless Rights Project of the Legal Aid Society. "Now, in the waning days of the administration, the city's lawyers for the first time are saying housing is the solution -- as is the mayor."
Mr. Giuliani also chided landlords yesterday for resisting efforts to rent some of their apartments as part of the federally subsidized housing program known as Section 8. Last year, the city had 2,700 of the Section 8 vouchers, which can bridge the gap between what poor tenants can pay and a moderate market rent. Yet about 900 of the vouchers went to waste, Mr. Giuliani said, because landlords had rejected them.
Of late, however, city officials have been scrambling to be conciliatory with such landlords, brought to the table by Joe Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlord group.
City lawyers quickly learned that a major reason landlords had avoided the federal program was frustration with the city. Waits for city inspections took weeks, while apartments were supposed to stay vacant. There were lags in subsidy payments, with no one available to resolve them. And the city's welfare practices, Mr. Strasburg said, made it increasingly likely that when the tenant's share of the rent was from public assistance, the check would be cut off without warning, leaving the landlord with unpaid arrears.
In response, in recent weeks, the city has added inspectors, promised streamlining, and offered double bonuses to the landlords who come up with the first 250 apartments for homeless families.
"The attitude for years has been you'd have to be crazy to take subsidized tenants, because of all the problems associated with it," Mr. Strasburg said. "The city for the first time is truly willing to make structural changes in the system so the crisis can be averted this winter." 
Veterans of the Giuliani administration's policies on homeless people say it may be too little, too late.
"There wasn't sufficient housing put into the pipeline years ago," Ms. Cutler said. "There was a cutback, and yes, now the city is attempting to put more on line. But at a time when landlords can rent to nonhomeless families, even when the market rate is being met and the city is further inducing these landlords, these landlords are still not putting any units on the table."
The mayor's emphasis on rent subsidies and new construction to meet the needs of homeless families represents a striking turnaround.
Mr. Giuliani came into office in 1994 saying the city should not be providing low-cost housing to the homeless because it only drew more people to use the shelters as a shortcut to a subsidized apartment. He vowed, as well, to challenge the consent decree that gives the city's truly homeless a right to shelter.
And in 1996, as the shelter population rose and the supply of city-owned housing in the pipeline from the Koch administration petered out, Mr. Giuliani instituted tough screening procedures that resulted in more families being turned away.
But in fact families re-applied, and those who made it into the shelters wound up staying longer. In court last year, the administration lost its bid to impose rules that would have significantly curtailed the right to shelter. And as welfare rolls were cut and the economic boom drove housing costs to new highs, the working poor increasingly showed up along with the destitute at the doorstep of the shelter system.
Homeless families began to be left on the floors of city offices again, spurring new contempt motions against the city in court, as did a system of shuttling families between one-night beds.
"I can't screw the front door any tighter," Martin Oesterreich, the city's commissioner of homeless services, said last February, when the number of homeless people lodged nightly in the shelters crossed the 25,000 mark.
With the shelter census now more than 28,000, city officials have been forced to redouble their efforts at the system's back door.
But tax-delinquent properties, used in past years for low-income and homeless families, are now transferred to private owners who offer many of the apartments at market rents. The city believed that was the best way to revitalize troubled neighborhoods, but those working with the homeless saw the loss of housing options for the most needy.
In trying to meet the crisis, the city now finds itself competing with itself. It has in effect taken 800 apartments off the rental market by paying landlords $100 a night to lodge families there temporarily, though those apartments would otherwise rent for a third as much.
"That one I never really understood," Mr. Strasburg said.

HEADLINE: Debate on Expanding O'Hare Airport Moves to House Panel 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Taking a blunt approach to air travel delays, a House subcommittee took up a bill today to forbid states to block airport expansion and, specifically, would allow Chicago to rebuild O'Hare International Airport and add a runway without state permission.
 O'Hare has the nation's second-highest volume of air traffic, and delays there frequently gum up traffic around the country. 
 Opposing any expansion, residents in the vicinity say the airport is already too noisy and produces too much air pollution. 
The debate over O'Hare mirrors airport controversies around the country, but this afternoon the hearing of the House subcommittee on aviation was at times an all-Illinois dispute. 
"The interests of a powerful few cannot and should not override the national interest," said the bill's sponsor, Representative William O. Lipinski, Democrat of Illinois, who complained that local politics was hurting people traveling to or through Chicago. 
Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, opposed the bill, saying it violated the Constitution. He pointed out that most airports were built by agencies created by the states.
"The law is clear," he said, " Congress has no power to intrude upon or interfere with a state's decision as to how to allocate state power."
Mr. Hyde's interest may have been more than legal. Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican, testifying against the bill, pointed out that the O'Hare rebuilding plan put forward by Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago "takes out the condominium that Henry Hyde lives in."
Mr. Hyde touched on the philosophical aspect of the problem.
"Congressman Lipinski used the term 'local politics' as a pejorative," Mr. Hyde said. But local politics, he continued, amounted to "the consent of the governed, which is the core of our democracy."
At issue is whether to build a major new airport 30 miles south of the city, near Peotone, a project for which the Illinois Legislature has appropriated money. 
On July 9, Mr. Daley proposed a 15-year, $6.3 billion O'Hare project. The airlines oppose a new airport, saying it will increase infrastructure costs.
"The stakes for the national air transport system and indeed our nation's economy are far too high to allow the expansion of O'Hare or any other critical airport to be held hostage by local politics," Donald J. Carty, chairman and chief executive of American Airlines, said today.
Behind the debate is the realization that for many hours of the day traffic at airports around the country is above capacity as measured by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
The airport improvements are subsidized by the F.A.A., but Illinois and 25 other states, including New York and New Jersey, require that those payments be channeled through a state agency, giving the state veto power. 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 4, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about a House bill that would allow airports to expand without state permission misstated the position held by an opponent, Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois. He is a member of the House Judiciary Committee, not its chairman.

Take a Stroll In the Park, On a Budget

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
"PARKIES" -- people who care more about parks than just about anything -- held a mayoral forum on Tuesday evening where five of the six major candidates turned up and agreed on one of the easiest things to agree on in a campaign for City Hall. They admitted -- surprise -- to loving parks.
 But while each deplored budget cuts that have hurt many parks, only Peter F. Vallone would make a specific commitment about increasing city financing. 
 Mark Green, recalling the "Read my lips" debacle of the first President Bush, would not go beyond promising an ambiguous budget increase, nor would Alan G. Hevesi, Fernando Ferrer or Herman Badillo. Michael R. Bloomberg, the only no-show at the forum, which was sponsored by Parks 2001, an advocacy campaign, has taken the same position. 
The reason is obvious. In New York, parks are seen as a frill. The last four mayors have concentrated resources on core services, especially education and the police, and as a result, parks spending has been in decline. Since the mid-1980's, the city parks budget has dropped by 40 percent and full-time staffing is down by more than 60 percent. There is only one worker for every 43 acres of parkland today, and the full-time recreation work force has been cut by 75 percent.
The result is what Mr. Ferrer called "three separate park systems": those supported by the private sector, like Central, Bryant and Prospect Parks; those in affluent neighborhoods, where people know how to influence elected officials; and the rest -- parks in largely poor, minority neighborhoods, where weeds grow with abandon, water fountains and bathrooms are broken and playgrounds are often vandalized.
During the forum held at the Downtown Athletic Club on West Street, the candidates acknowledged the problem. Mr. Green suggested levying fees on those who live near parks, and all the candidates said that they would consider returning concession fees to the parks.
Only Mr. Vallone said he would hold parks sacrosanct from budget cuts and embraced the main goal of Parks 2001 -- doubling the parks budget to 1 percent of the city's $39.7 billion budget. The others would not be locked in. "No one can make a 1 percent commitment with a straight face," Mr. Ferrer said.
What may have been most interesting about the evening forum is what did not come up. Chicago. Earlier on Tuesday, Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago spoke at a parks conference held at the Museum of Natural History on Central Park West. Fans say that Mr. Daley is to parks what Mr. Giuliani is to crime. He gets national plaudits for reviving parks in Chicago, which cover 7,330 acres and have an annual budget of $280 million ($320 million if you include city-financed museums within parks). New York City's parks -- 28,358 acres -- get $200 million in city money.
MOST of the parks budget comes from a dedicated percentage of the real estate tax; the rate is set by a seven-member board of commissioners appointed by the mayor, who also names the superintendent of the Chicago Park District.
Obviously, the mayor controls the system, which in the past has been a mess of patronage. Mr. Daley is credited with cleaning that out, rescuing schoolyards from asphalt, improving park maintenance and addressing charges that the lakefront bordering poor, predominantly black neighborhoods was neglected.
Parks improve education and quality of life and reduce crime, Mr. Daley said in an interview. "We don't say, parks here, the police station here, libraries here, public schools here," he said. "Parks are part of the whole quality of a city."
New York and Chicago are not directly comparable, but the Chicago system at least seems worth debating. It didn't come up Tuesday, and those candidates reached later were not enthusiastic, no doubt reflecting a reluctance to consider raising taxes or to losing control over city dollars.
What's next for the parks? Some of the parkies said after the forum that they were thrilled to get the attention of candidates. Others worried that if the economy softens further, additional resources will be wrenched from the parks. Mr. Hevesi, the most fiscally conservative on the panel, in effect conceded the possibility.
"Folks," Mr. Hevesi warned, "if you want this increase, as deserved as it is for the parks, you've got to understand that the nature of the city's revenue stream and the economy will decide whether we'll be able to do this or not. We have enormous demands throughout this city, and it's all competitive."

HEADLINE: Bush Promotes Education, And in a Calculated Forum 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
President Bush pressured Congress today to settle differences in House and Senate education bills and send legislation to him as quickly as possible, saying the state of many urban schools was a "great and continuing scandal" that cried out for rapid action.
 "Rarely in American history have we faced a problem so serious and destructive on which change has come so slowly," Mr. Bush said in a speech here to the National Urban League, a predominantly black group. 
 He asserted that such change was almost within reach and urged Congress to go the remaining distance without delay, using the imminent start of a new school year as a summons to action. 
"Time is running short," Mr. Bush said. "We're now in August. In 35 days, school starts in New York City. Thirty-four days -- schools open in Oakland, Calif."
That oratorical countdown, like the rest of Mr. Bush's speech, was intended to add momentum to his stalled education proposals. The president also wanted to throw a spotlight on the issue, a popular one with bipartisan appeal, at a moment when Congress is clogged with more contentious debates.
And Mr. Bush's speech, coupled with the audience he selected, underscored the administration's desire to present the president in a more moderate light. Mr. Bush's outreach to members of minorities has been especially vigorous lately; earlier this week, he spoke to a convention of black law enforcement officers.
In his remarks today, he frequently mentioned an achievement gap between white and black students and repeatedly framed his push to hold failing schools accountable as something that would help African-American students.
"An equal society," Mr. Bush said, would begin with "equally excellent schools."
The overall reaction to Mr. Bush was respectful but not wildly enthusiastic.
"I'm impressed that he's here today," said Erroll Reese, who owns a technological company in Durham, N.C. "And I'm interested in what he's saying. We all need, collectively, to come together to solve this problem. It's not his problem. It's not my problem. It's our problem."
But Mr. Reese and a half-dozen other people in the audience said they were reserving judgment on whether Mr. Bush's prescriptions would work, and almost all of them said they were Democrats who had not voted for Mr. Bush.
Mr. Bush wants student performance in public schools to be measured rigorously, and he wants schools that fail to show improvement to be held accountable, in part by letting the students enrolled there seize other options.
The Senate and House bills address these goals and put these changes into effect in slightly different ways, varying in how strictly students should be judged, how soon schools should be punished and how much money should be directed toward the problem.
As these differences get hashed out in a conference committee, Democrats want more funding than Republicans -- including Mr. Bush -- do. And Mr. Bush said today that simply raising the federal investment of dollars had not worked and was like "pumping gas into a flooded engine."
Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who is on the committee, countered in a written statement that "reform without adequate funding is cruelty."
Several hours after Mr. Bush's speech, House and Senate conferees said they had reached agreement on some minor differences and had decided to continue meeting through August. They are scheduled to meet on Thursday with Mr. Bush at the White House.
The administration sees Mr. Bush's focus on education as a potential bridge to the kinds of minorities who do not usually vote Republican. Despite Mr. Bush's frequent speeches about education in the presidential campaign, he fared poorly among black voters.
The Urban League, a nonprofit group promoting economic progress and civil rights for African-Americans, is more conservative than the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the league's president, Hugh Price, has long supported many of Mr. Bush's education ideas.
In introducing Mr. Bush today, Mr. Price said the president "genuinely believes to the marrow of his bones that America must leave no child behind."

To the Editor:
 Re "White House Says the U.S. Is Not a Loner, Just Choosy" (front page, July 31): 
 Why is it assumed that President Bush is a loner concerning international treaties? 
He wants to withdraw from a treaty with a country that no longer exists (the Soviet Union); opposes a protocol that would undermine United States economic growth and thus destabilize the global economy; and has demanded amendments to a pact that tries to create an underhanded limit of the Second Amendment.
Are these the positions of a president who is an isolationist, or of a president who evaluates each agreement with the best interests of the country in mind?

HEADLINE: America's New Take on the World 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 While President Bush and Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld are quite passionate about building a missile defense system and violating the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty (front page, July 31), there are more of us who want to see America prevent arms races and adhere to principles of global leadership. 
 The cost of a unilateral decision to build a missile shield that is likely never to fully work and that would cause a widespread arms race would be billions in wasted tax dollars and our role as a trusted keeper of international treaties and law. 
It is time for Americans to speak out against missile defense. Doing so is not weak on defense, un-American or un-Republican. It is the only sensible stance in today's global economy.
Let's engage the world rather than hide from it behind a shield.

HEADLINE: Proposing the Use of Computer Mapping to Improve School Accountability 

 BODY:
 Following are excerpts from an interview with Mark Green, the public advocate and a Democratic candidate for mayor. The interview was conducted yesterday by editors and reporters of The New York Times, and it is the fifth in a planned series of interviews with each of the major candidates.

Q. You've become familiar to New Yorkers over many years as part of a wing of a party that in the last few years has become associated with high crime, high welfare, squeegee men, all kinds of things. And you've gone to some lengths to say that you're not the guy who brought those things. Why should people believe that?

A. I plead guilty to being in the Roosevelt-Kennedy Democratic Party, which has over the last half century helped revive the economy and tried to breach racial divides. It was the Clinton-Gore administration, allow me to remind you, that sent up to 100,000 more cops to our streets and turned federal red ink to black ink.
First, I'm a proud progressive Democrat on issues like social justice, choice, gay rights -- without ever having to shift positions because of an election year. I am very tough-minded on criminal justice issues and economic issues. . . .

Q. Can you talk policy-wise the way a Green administration would be different than a Giuliani administration? . . .

A. My candidacy and mayoralty are and will be relentlessly focused on educating children and protecting families. . . .
On educating children, I think the Giuliani administration gets a failing grade. Instead, I would focus primarily on investing ideas and resources K through 3, so no child is in a class larger than 20. It's not easy, it's not cheap. But all the pedagogical studies show that is the best way to convey literacy and numeracy skills at the biological moment kids are ready. . . .
Second, I want to -- if this mayor won't, I will negotiate a big deal with teachers where they will get more pay, a lot of it incentive pay for more performance, will get more professional development, will get smaller class sizes, which they are as interested in as more pay. But in exchange for more performance. . . .

Q. Talk to me . . . about the performance side of that.

A. . . . The city has to pay more to assure that the best teachers don't flee to the suburbs. But we should expect more. For example, if principals agreed to a contract that they could be canned, after due process, in 60 days for poor performance or 90 days for malfeasance, why not teachers? . . . Finally, you can have incentive pay, which is not test- based and classroom-based. . . . Incentive pay means that -- or bonus pay means that you pay more for more: if a teacher tutors younger colleagues, if a teacher spends more time in the summer, if a teacher gets more credentials. If the whole school's scores go up, you have bonus pay for the team. . . .
And second, on protecting families, we're all thankful that because of certain national trends and Giuliani-Bratton strategies, crime is down in New York City substantially more than in other urban areas. But I'm not satisfied. And there's a whole crime agenda that can now -- it's not instead of smart quality-of-life policing, which I would continue, but it's in addition to it. And it involves more community policing, as other cities are doing better. It involves stopping the hollowing out of our Police Department by providing more pay and better precincts and tuition assistance for cops who need it. And it involves smarter preventive policing. . . .

Q. Are stop-and-frisk policies under Giuliani and things like Operation Condor among the policies that you support in continuing forward?

A. No. Of course every police department in world history has some version of stop-and-frisk. And I'd continue that consistent with Fourth Amendment standards.
At the same time, there is extraordinary anecdotal and statistical evidence that there is a level of racial profiling on the streets of New York. . . . And so I would revisit stop-and-frisk procedures to make sure that they were bona fide and not racially motivated, de facto. I don't believe there's racial profiling de jure. I don't believe the mayor or the police commissioner has ordered it. . . .
Now Commissioner Kerik has acknowledged this and is trying to change it by at least requiring that officers explain after a stop-and-frisk that led to nothing why that citizen was stopped. And I'd encourage that.

Q. And Condor?

A. That crime is down doesn't mean: A) it can't go down further; and B) that the department is being well managed. . . .
So among the things I worry about is inheriting a hollowed, as I said, a hollowed-out Police Department. Where I want to continue the good strategies of Giuliani and Bratton that have worked on precinct accountability, computer mapping, quality-of-life policing. But take a fresh look on those that have caused enormous social divisions and have hurt law enforcement. . . . 

Q. Condor you'd put in that category?

A. I want to take a fresh look at Condor. I think Condor is largely responsible for the $300 million overtime budget. And I think there are more effective ways to deter drug use and criminal conduct than the current method of Condor and the overtime budget that we are now paying for.

Q. So you say more emphasis on prevention?

A. Absolutely. . . . Nine in 10 police commissioners around the country in a survey said it's essential to invest in safe, affordable day care as among the ways to deter crime. And so I have plans on how to better reduce gun use, on how better to police in precincts where youth violence is up, on how to provide alternative youth corps. . . .

Q. Why, really? Why the statistics are going down everywhere, or have been for the last several years?

A. I think fair-minded criminologists and officials would say the predominant reason crime is down so much in all urban areas is the abatement of the crack epidemic in the late 80's. . . . Second, the age cohort that commits a disproportionate percentage of the crime -- 14- to 20-year-olds -- did not see a population boom in the last decade. . . .
Mayor Giuliani deserves -- Mayor Giuliani and Commissioner Bratton deserve their share of . . . credit. But neither of them invented parallel processing. 

Q. What? . . .

A. And so they happily decided to use computers and data entry to map crimes per block and neighborhood rather than put colored pins to track grand theft auto and rape and armed robbery. . . . I support the idea that commanding officers have to measure when crime bumps up in a particular block and have a strategy for how to reduce it or else they won't stay commanding officers. . . .

Q. What do you think about the whole debate over applying Comstat to the school system?

A. Well, absolutely. Comstat means using computer mapping to track things. We need a Comstat in every agency -- to measure how many people go from welfare to workfare to permanent work. I said I wanted a Comstat for kids, for juveniles. . . . Of course, entering data into computers should track which of our 1,100 schools are working, which aren't, which districts have superintendents that are successful and which aren't. . . . And I believe in accountability. I want more mayoral control. And so my chancellor and superintendents and principals will report, ultimately, to me as mayor on how they're performing. And the only way to know that is by data and by conversation. . . .

Q. Can we talk about money a bit?

A. Sure.

Q. I think everybody agrees the next four years the next mayor's going to face probably a decline in revenues and quite possibly an increase in demands for services . . .

A. I have laid out, I believe, the largest fresh economic framework of any of the candidates running. And first, instead of just focusing on saying, 'Let's raise taxes,' or 'Let's never raise taxes,' which is a stale bipolar conversation, I focus on how -- on a thing called better management, and laid out in a talk a year ago how I think I could save several hundred million dollars by pursuing gain sharing, smart procurement and more electronic government. . . .
Second, I want to build out downtown Brooklyn in the way the state and city had a development corporation that built up West 42nd Street. . . .
Third, it is essential to invest in information technology training. That's the future for New York workers. That's -- computer technician jobs are the new middle-class jobs now that we don't have and will never again have 800,000 manufacturing jobs in the region.
And fourth, I want to help revive the economy . . . by spending scarce economic development dollars, not in building more stadiums, but in investing in more community-based organizations bottom up. . . .
Finally, fifth, I want a whole new relationship with the Port Authority. I've been a pretty strong critic of how they've underinvested in the New York side of the port, given our population and profits. But at the end of the day, instead of trying to blow them up we have to have a cooperative relationship, which I believe I will have. And we will have more lease payments for our airports, and they have billions of dollars that we need to invest in a cross-harbor freight tunnel, in an expansion of the Javits Center, in a Second Avenue subway. . . .

Q. At the risk of being stale and bipolar, do you have anything to say on the tax side?

A. Sure. . . . I have my own tax package, which had other tax cuts that were not pursued by the mayor or speaker. I wanted to eliminate the utility of gross-receipts tax, the energy tax, because it's regressive and hurts large families and because it discourages technology companies from coming into New York. I wanted to increase the earned-income tax credit so a working person earning let's say 20,000 a year who doesn't now pay federal and state taxes then wouldn't pay city taxes. . . .

Q. If you have an economic downturn, would any city services be inviolate from cuts? . . .

A. Of course the answer is no, because if there's a depression, you have to be open-minded to all sacred cows. Now having said that, I want to maintain the force level of the Police Department and not reduce teachers. . . . The three public functions I would first hold harmless are police on the streets, teachers and senior centers. . . .

Q. Bill Bratton had said that he thought the Police Department had grown too large. And I know he's advising you on some of these issues. Do you disagree with him on that?

A. Yes. I want to maintain the current -- actually, we're short of the desired level of 41,000-plus because of extraordinary recruitment problems. But my goal is to maintain that 41,000-force level, but my essential focus is more cops on the streets. . . .

Q. When you say they're underpaid, do you believe that they deserve a raise that's beyond what the rest of the uniformed coalition has gotten?

A. That's a very hard question. We've had pattern bargaining for years. And there are reasons of convenience, stability and continuity to pattern bargaining. So my presumption's in favor of it. But again, that's a sacred cow I really want to think hard about. . . . And so I intend to appoint a commissioner of work force development and labor who is more a czar, looking at whether we should adjust pay based on gain sharing, based on bargaining with individual unions rather than merely pattern bargaining, on work force development so companies now follow a trained work force rather than workers follow companies in the modern era. . . .

Q. I just want to clarify, you don't know now whether you want to break the pattern bargaining for the police?

A. Right. What I said was my presumption is in favor of pattern bargaining. . . .

Q. . . . I suspect you hear this but if you don't I think I can speak for many of us who do, about Mark Green, anecdotally people say this off the record when we're interviewing them . . . "Mark Green: nice guy, very smart, knows government inside out, but he's mired in the 70's. I don't care if Bill Bratton is supporting him, I don't care who's supporting him, when he gets in there he's going to handcuff the police."
. . . How do you strike a balance when it comes to the stops-and-frisks and other strategies? Do you have to violate civil rights to some degree? . . .

A. . . . I totally -- I've been warned against this, but here it goes -- it is true I was a founder of and the editor in chief of the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review. We're not going to become -- we are not a Cincinnati, and when I'm mayor we're not going to become a Cincinnati or an Iraq because we are not going to allow police to violate civil rights and civil liberties as a precondition to reducing crime because it's not a requirement. . . .
And so I don't need a law to stop racial profiling. As mayor I'll issue an executive order. . . . If there is credible testimony describing a perpetrator and it's a 5-foot-6 black man with a goatee, if the police in and around that area see someone running who fits that description, yes, they can stop them. But you can't stop every black person in that area. . . .

Q. Outside of the Police Department and schools, what are the city agencies that you might mention that you think need the most work? And what are some of your specific ideas as to what you'd do to fix them?

A. . . . All of them have to be better in terms of delivering services and data on line. This takes time. And so the Department of Buildings is probably the least competent department at delivering the service intended. I want them to get in the habit of building again rather than frustrating building. . . .

Q. Do you think destitution is up as a result of welfare reform?

A. Probably. The reports of increasing numbers of people going to food kitchens is one measure how -- is one corollary result of the reduction in welfare. The reduction in welfare is desirable so long as people who are actually destitute and entitled to help get it, and so long as people on welfare get the training and day care they need to get off it.

Q. Is there anything that the city can do to make sure that there are jobs for these people?

A. Probably. One of the things I want a commission of work force development and labor to look at is to what extent the city can help provide transitional jobs for people who need it. . . .


Q. I don't want to let you out of here without talking about housing. . . . Everybody seems to agree there's not enough of it and it's too expensive. What are you going to do about that?

A. . . . First, you reform the Buildings Department. You take a totally zero-based look at the zoning resolution since so much has changed in the 40 years since. And I'm appointing a panel . . . to figure out how to reduce the probably 10 percent mob tax on the contracting industry.
So Step 1 is to reduce costs by smarter governing. Step 2 is how to have smarter preservation policies. . . . Step 3 is to find fresh revenues, bond it and put up at least 50,000 units of new housing in the next five years and rehabilitate -- renovate or rehabilitate 75,000 new ones.

Q. And where does that money come from?

A. Give credit to advocacy groups who are smart and focused on it. Housing First proposed a housing trust fund and it's good news . . . that candidates agree on something rather than disagree on something. And all of us have looked, rightly, to taking Battery Park revenues, which were promised to be spun off for low- and middle-income housing and applying it to it, looking to future tax revenues from and sales of city property. There's less city property to be sold off but there's still some more to be sold off. . . .
The revenue from property taxes will go from 8 to 10 billion, 2001 to 2005. You can't spend that money twice and there's a lot of demand for it. But there is some money available in the next four years that could be segregated into a housing trust. . . .

Q. Do you, on housing, think that rent regulation is a significant contributors to the housing problem to the city?

A. It may be a marginal contributor, but I want to maintain rent stabilization and control other than the decontrol. And a person or a couple has 175,000 in income, it should go to market rate. . . .

HEADLINE: Deal Is Reached On a Bill to Set Patients' Rights 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
President Bush and Representative Charlie Norwood, the leader of a six-year campaign to enact a patients' bill of rights, said tonight that they had agreed on compromise legislation, clearing the way for House passage of the measure this week.
 The agreement stunned Mr. Norwood's allies in Congress, who were meeting to discuss strategy at themoment he was going to the White House to shake hands on the deal with Mr. Bush. 
 "Congressman Norwood and I have reached an agreement on how to get a patients' bill of rights out of the House of Representatives," Mr. Bush said. 
The agreement, a personal triumph for Mr. Bush, spares him from what could have been a major political embarrassment if the House had voted for the original version of Mr. Norwood's bill, in defiance of Mr. Bush's earlier threat to veto it.
Appearing with Mr. Bush at the White House, Mr. Norwood, a Georgia Republican and onetime dentist, said: "The bottom line and the goal is, we want to change the law. And the last time I looked, that's pretty difficult to do without the presidential signature."
The compromise, reached after weeks of talks between Mr. Norwood and the White House, would make it easier for patients to sue insurance companies in state court and to collect damages in cases where care is wrongly denied. But the agreement would allow employers to take steps to protect themselves from liability.
Senate sponsors of the patients' rights bill denounced the agreement. The chief Senate sponsor, John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said it "favors the H.M.O. over the patient."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said he was pleased Mr. Bush accepted the substantive protections of the Senate bill, but said the agreement "makes these rights unenforceable." And "a right without a remedy is not an effective right," Mr. Kennedy said.
The other principal sponsor of the Senate bill, John Edwards, Democrat of North Carolina, called the deal "a bad proposal." It would, he said, maintain the privileged legal position that health maintenance organizations have under existing law.
The House plans to take up the patients' rights legislation on Thursday, a day before Congress is scheduled to begin a monthlong summer recess. Mr. Bush and Mr. Norwood said their agreement would be translated into legislative language, which can be offered as an amendment to the bill. House Republican leaders said the amendment and the bill would almost surely be approved because they would have support from Mr. Norwood, the White House and Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois. Lawmakers of both parties respect Mr. Norwood, and many have said they will follow his lead.
"Norwood gives you the Good Housekeeping seal of approval," said John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Mr. Hastert. "He will bring along a lot of undecided House members."
Mr. Feehery gave some details of the agreement. Injured patients, he said, would have a federal right to sue H.M.O.'s and insurers in state court. The scope of insurer liability would be defined by federal law.
Patients could recover damages equal to the full amount of any lost wages or other financial losses. Payments for pain and suffering and other noneconomic damages would be limited to $1.5 million. A plaintiff could also recover up to $1.5 million in punitive damages if a health plan refused to provide care ordered by independent medical reviewers.
Under the agreement, an employer could be sued if it directly participated in a decision to deny claims for health benefits promised to employees. But an employer could protect itself by naming an outside entity known as a "designated decision-maker" to rule on claims and bear the legal liability.
In June, by a 59-to-36 vote, the Senate passed a similar bill giving patients a much broader right to sue health plans for improper denial of care. Both bills define a wide range of rights for people with insurance, guaranteeing access to emergency care, medical specialists and an independent medical review of decisions denying benefit claims.
The biggest unresolved issue between Mr. Bush and Mr. Norwood had been the patients' right to sue H.M.O.'s and insurers when they believed they had been injured because of improper delay or denial of care.
Mr. Bush had said the Senate bill and the original Norwood bill would have permitted explosive growth in lawsuits, raising the cost of insurance and, thus, the number of Americans without coverage.
Mr. Bush said the agreement illustrated the bipartisan cooperation he promised to bring to the nation's capital, and he praised Mr. Norwood for practicing "the art of what is possible."
The issue of where suits are filed is important; plaintiffs' lawyers say that experience suggests they can win larger verdicts at the state level than they can in federal courts.
Under pressure from Mr. Norwood and others in Congress, Mr. Bush made a significant concession, agreeing that patients denied care should be able to hold their health plans accountable in state courts, not in federal court as he had wanted.
Under the Senate bill, patients could sue insurers in state court for medical decisions, or in federal court for administrative decisions. In federal court, there would be no limits on damages for economic loss or pain and suffering, and patients could win up to $5 million in civil penalties resembling punitive damages. In state court, damages would be subject to the limits of state law, if any such caps existed.
Under the agreement, patients could sue an H.M.O. even if independent medical reviewers had found no justification for their claims. But in those cases, the patients would have a higher burden of proof than if they had prevailed in the external review process. There would be a legal presumption that the decision of the external reviewers was correct, but patients could disprove that assumption with enough evidence.
The legislation would set the first comprehensive federal standards for health insurance, which has been regulated mainly by the states. States could continue to enforce their laws, provided they were at least as stringent as the federal standards. 
If the House passes the bill, as expected, the next step would be for the two chambers to try to resolve their differences in a conference committee. The Senate negotiators would probably include Senators McCain, Edwards and Kennedy.
Polls have repeatedly shown that voters want Congress to pass a patients' bill of rights and trust Democrats more than Republicans to handle the issue. Lawmakers of both parties, but especially Republicans, feared they would be pilloried by their opponents if they failed to pass a bill before next year's elections.
With formal language still not available late this evening, some Democrats said the vote should be delayed until Friday or September.
Representative Marion Berry, an Arkansas Democrat and co-sponsor of the Norwood bill, said: "The compromise amounts to nothing more than a loosely stated idea. We haven't seen the actual legislative language, and we don't expect to see it until we are asked to vote on it."
Moreover, Mr. Berry said: "I consider this a breach of a bipartisan effort that has been going on for years. There was nothing bipartisan about the White House approach to this issue."
Representative Greg Ganske, an Iowa Republican who helped write the Norwood bill, was surprised by the agreement. "Charlie cut his own deal with the White House," Mr. Ganske said. "He did not share any information with us."
Mr. Norwood had often said he would consult his co-sponsors before making any deal. Mr. Norwood acknowledged that "the general reaction wais disappointment."
He defended his action, saying, "The deal had to be cut by somebody, and I was the someone elected to do it."

HEADLINE: Harlem's Visible Man 

BYLINE:  By David Levering Lewis; David Levering Lewis is the author of "When Harlem Was in Vogue." He won Pulitzer Prizes this year and in 1994 for a two-volume biography of W.E.B. Du Bois.

 BODY:
The long-awaited second coming of William Jefferson Clinton happened on a day of splendid weather and general thanksgiving in Harlem. Current and former elected officials lauded him as the last legitimate occupant of the White House, and the Republican secretary of state of New York proclaimed the day "William Jefferson Clinton Day" in the name of the governor. Family matters detained the senatorial Clinton. Rare good judgment kept Mayor Rudolph Giuliani away. Harlem's adroit perennial congressman, Charles Rangel, praised the economic impact of the former administration's empowerment zone in language akin to that lavished on the Marshall Plan. The New Black Panthers and a few others sounded discordant notes about exploitative gentrification and the loss of community identity, but they were drowned out by thousands of others in the plaza fronting the state office building bearing the name of the original "king of the cats," Adam Clayton Powell. Bill Clinton, famously described by Toni Morrison as the first black president, had come home. 
 "I ain't dead yet," the former president told the delighted crowd. Although he was half-joking about playing his saxophone some night at the legendary Apollo Theater, his words inescapably invite speculation as to the larger meaning they may hold. For the politician whose favorite sobriquet is "The Comeback Kid," Harlem, idolizing and insular, may well prove to be the ticket to redemption, an expiatory stop among the needy and historically abused along the road to Damascus. It is surely not implausible that the quarter's reputed magic of release and renewal -- of renaissance -- can be expected to redound to its latest fallen idol. 
 Millions of Americans who regret the Clinton presidency as a prodigious squandering of talent by one of the most brilliant politicians to occupy the Oval Office find scant sympathy for their displeasure among Harlemites. This is true not only because of the almost ineffable loyalty that some Southern white politicians evoke in black people (Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter and even George Wallace), but also because the moral outrage Bill Clinton's misdeeds have engendered among the American mainstream is seen by black Americans as part and parcel of the immemorial hypocrisy of the value system that has repeatedly victimized them. Like him, they too have been rebuked and scorned. The role of the African-American as surrogate for the troubles and malefactions of white people is as old as the Republic, a part carefully scripted in the antebellum South and archetypally acted out in American literature from Harriet Beecher Stowe to William Faulkner and beyond, and one whose present-day vitality was vividly displayed a few days ago north of Central Park.
Jazz Age Harlem was thought to put touring Caucasians in touch with their real selves, to be a place of primal authenticity where fingers could feel the pulse of life -- much as Harlem strikes President Clinton as a place "human and alive," as he said, "where there was a rhythm to life and a song in the heart."
Mr. Clinton knows that many who are singing today may not like the music they will be hearing in the near future. Harlem's famous commuter has promised to do his part to safeguard the community's "great diversity" and to keep the worst consequences of urban development from harming the community as property values spike and developers alight. "I don't want small business people to be run out because I'm coming in," he said to thunderous applause. But even with the former president's good intentions, we would be more than a little naive to think that large numbers of poor and working-poor families in Harlem won't have been displaced by increasing gentrification. Yet, barring a steep economic recession, who can doubt that the joyous welcome of this world figure signals a profound shift of the plates under the city's psychological and residential crust? Henceforth, the region above Central Park that survived riots, crime and special-interest politics and even defied the logic of the market is open for business to all comers.
The changes in store for Harlem may well pale beside the transubstantiation of the charismatic newcomer. After addressing AIDS, peace, poverty and other problems local and global from his bully pulpit on 125th Street, William Jefferson Clinton will, in all likelihood, emerge redeemed to an amnesiac American public. The former president could represent his people as mayor, city councilman or congressman; even the governor's office would not be beyond his range of choices. Whatever his remarkable future brings -- running a foundation called Hope or running a studio in Hollywood -- the last word must go to that Clinton spokeswoman who said of the Harlem advent, "The bottom line about today is . . . the former president had a wonderful time."

HEADLINE: Green Stakes Out Positions Starkly Contrasting Giuliani's 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Mark Green said yesterday that if he were elected mayor, his administration would be profoundly different from the current one running New York City, even within the Police Department, where he would like to shift some of the overtime budget used for crime fighting to social programs for the police and for crime prevention.
 Even when Mr. Green, New York City's public advocate, was not offering policy proposals that differ from those employed by Rudolph W. Giuliani, he took numerous opportunities to criticize the mayor and the way he has run the city for the last eight years, in turn presenting a vision for City Hall that is in many ways antithetical to that of the current mayor. 
 His targets ranged from the Giuliani administration's record on education reform ("a failing grade," he said) to the Police Department ("mismanaged") to health care policy ("I don't see much of a policy") to the mayor's approach to economic development ("he squandered his bully pulpit"). 
He called Mr. Giuliani's administration secretive, saying: "For seven and a half years, there was an iron curtain between his government and the public when it came to distributing information to reporters and to citizens." Mr. Green vowed to create an administration that would be open to and would consult with the city at large. "The top-down government-by-enemies-list method of governing, I hope, subsides," he said. "And I want to have a far more small-D democratic, interactive, transparent, open government."
Mr. Green, who confidently predicts "when I am mayor," said his vision included a more efficient government that would rely more heavily on technology and a school system in which children in the early grades would be in classes with no more than 19 other students and in which teachers get raises.
He also said he would like to repair the relationship between the city and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, using tax revenues from the sale of the World Trade Center for transportation initiatives, in a departure from some of his competitors, who would like that money earmarked for new housing. Mr. Green said he would like to increase the morale of police officers and keep them from defecting to the suburbs. 
But in terms of actual policy proposals, Mr. Green also carefully sought to take the middle of the road during a 90-minute interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times yesterday, avoiding controversial initiatives and declining to commit to specific positions on a few occasions.
He said he was not sure whether he would pursue new tax cuts, nor would he rule out future tax increases; he selected no single agency for definite cutbacks during hard times, yet he deemed few impervious to budget trimming. He said he favored the current system for negotiating with the city's unionized workers, but added that he was the first to get behind an overhaul of that process a few years ago. Mr. Green mentioned that he believed teachers should be subject to the same disciplinary procedures that principals face, but then added that those terms would be negotiable.
In choosing to defer some tough policy decisions until after the election, Mr. Green said that he was not trying to keep from alienating voters who are already squeamish about the notion that he is a traditional old party liberal who will drag the city into a fiscal or public safety crisis with 1970's-style social policies. 
"I'm a proud progressive Democrat on issues like social justice, choice, gay rights -- without ever having to shift positions because of an election year," Mr. Green said. "I am very tough-minded on criminal justice issues and economic issues."
Mr. Green is most specific on his key goal for education: smaller classes for the youngest children. "It's not easy, it's not cheap," he said. "But all the pedagogical studies show that is the best way to convey literacy and numeracy skills at the biological moment kids are ready."
In terms of how teachers should be compensated and evaluated, Mr. Green said he would like to give principals more power, adding that he supported "bonus pay" for teachers who achieved further professional development or advanced degrees.
When crediting Mr. Giuliani in one area in which most New Yorkers do tip their hats -- fighting crime -- Mr. Green was consistent in spreading that praise to former Police Commissioner William J. Bratton, who has endorsed him. "We're all thankful that because of certain national trends and Giuliani-Bratton strategies, crime is down in New York City substantially more than in other urban areas," he said.
But he added that he felt there was much work to be done in the area of how the police relate to black and Latino New Yorkers. "There is extraordinary anecdotal and statistical evidence that there is a level of racial profiling on the streets of New York," Mr. Green said. 
He added: "I don't believe the mayor or the police commissioner has ordered it. At the same time, communities of color in this city are furious at how their children -- they believe are -- how their children are being disproportionally stopped and frisked."
To that end, Mr. Green said he would, if elected, re-evaluate Operation Condor, a program in which officers are paid overtime to fight street crime. "I think Condor is largely responsible for the $300 million overtime budget," he said. 
Some money would simply be redirected. "I may want to spend some Condor money on tuition assistance for young cops, because all the data indicate the higher the educational level, the more productive and the less brutal officers are," he suggested. "I may want to spend some of that money on repairing decrepit precincts, because officers feel demoralized when they go into these awful -- when they work in these awful conditions. I may want to spend some Condor money on, as I said, to steal a phrase from Dennis Walcott, repeat midcareer tuneups so officers are better trained on when to stop and frisk."
As for added savings, he quipped: "I would substantially reduce police overtime by cutting Howard Safir's detail," referring to the former police commissioner.
Facing a slowing economy, Mr. Green laid out a modest, inexact proposal to raise new revenues apart from any change in tax policy. His ideas include more electronic government, building up downtown Brooklyn, investing in information technology training and pouring economic development dollars into small community-based industries and organizations.
Transportation initiatives could be earned, he said, through a new relationship with the Port Authority. "Instead of trying to blow them up," he said, "we have to have a cooperative relationship, which I believe I will have."
"We will have more lease payments for our airports," he said, "and they have billions of dollars that we need to invest in a cross-harbor freight tunnel, in an expansion of the Javits Center, in a Second Avenue subway. And they've all been stalled because of the personal animosity between the governor and the mayor, which will not exist between the next governor and the next mayor."
How will this be accomplished? In large part it seems through delegation. Mr. Green said he wanted to hire a chief technology officer to "look around the country and world for the smartest ways to deploy information technology to reduce the size and cost of city government." He also wants a "labor czar" who would help him to evaluate how the city negotiates with labor unions.
Mr. Green declined to outline a specific plan for housing. Instead, he said he would, if elected, convene a housing summit right away, "and have around it all the best, smartest, for-profit and not-for-profit builders, labor and management people, contracting people, churches that put up housing, poverty advocates to figure out where the revenue will come from and what the right mix of low- and middle-income housing is." 
In terms of transportation, Mr. Green said he longed for a multibillion-dollar cross-harbor freight tunnel to ship products and move solid waste now that Fresh Kills is shuttered, a regional MetroCard and an expansion of the E-ZPass. "I don't know of a -- other than getting rid of squeegee men -- I don't know a governmental advance more popular than E-ZPass," he said.

HEADLINE: As Whitman Deliberated Plan, the Pressures Mounted 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
The pressure faced by Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, on whether to proceed with the dredging of the Hudson River was enormous.
 On one side were General Electric and its chairman, Jack Welch, who were major contributors to President Bush's presidential campaign. Backing the company were many of the residents of the rock-ribbed Republican communities along the upper Hudson River. They opposed the dredging plan, which would cost General Electric half a billion dollars, saying it would do more harm than good and could destroy the river's recreational and economic life. 
 On the other side were a broad coalition of environmental groups and public officials, including some top Republicans, backed by years of the E.P.A.'s own scientific studies. They favored the dredging plan, which would be 10 times as big as any environmental cleanup undertaken in this country.
Mrs. Whitman, as the governor of New Jersey, had always supported cleaning up the Hudson and had favored the dredging proposal. But environmental groups grew concerned two weeks ago that under pressure from the Bush administration, she was brokering a deal with General Electric to soften the blow. Whether this was true remains unclear, but the perception galvanized the environmentalists and prompted Gov. George E. Pataki of New York to call Mrs. Whitman and declare his support for the dredging plan.
The environmental groups met with Mrs. Whitman on Thursday. In an otherwise scientific discussion, they told her that General Electric had spent perhaps $60 million on its antidredging campaign. Mrs. Whitman joked in response: From what she had seen, she said, the company must have spent $75 million.
The exact amount of the company's extensive antidredging media campaign, including television commercials, a half-hour infomercial and intensive lobbying efforts, is not known. What is known is that it seems to have come to naught.
The Bush administration, torn between the pro-business wing of the Republican Party and the moderate environmental wing, has sided -- this time -- with the environmentalists.
The White House today placed responsibility for the decision squarely on Mrs. Whitman, but added that Mr. Bush had supported her decision.
"This was an E.P.A. decision that E.P.A. made on the merits," said Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman. "E.P.A. decided to move forward cleaning up the river in a way that is environmentally sound and also responsive to the concerns of the people who live in the affected communities. The president, of course, supports E.P.A.'s decision."
At the E.P.A., Eileen McGinnis, Mrs. Whitman's chief of staff, said the agency's staff had briefed not President Bush but other White House officials, including those at the Council on Environmental Quality and the Office of Management and Budget, at least three times.
Ms. McGinnis said that Mrs. Whitman had considered four broad categories of questions as she examined the issue: the science of the plan, the economic effect on the local residents, whether a government agency could pull off a project of this magnitude, and whether a decision to dredge would be litigated.
But advocates of dredging said there were unmistakable signs that the administration was trying to find a way to soften the blow on an important corporate ally and also to signal to other companies that this would not be a precedent-setting decision that would force them as well into costly cleanups.
At the same time, the political implications of the decision were undeniable. As Lisa Guide, a deputy assistant secretary for policy in the Department of the Interior under President Bill Clinton, put it, "Environmental issues are sapping the life out of Bush's political viability, and the White House is trying to stop the bloodletting by allowing dredging in the Hudson."
Representative Maurice Hinchey, Democrat of New York, who favors dredging, met with Mrs. Whitman in his office two weeks ago. "She said some things to us that were encouraging, but she also said, and I'm quoting, 'What's proposed by the region is way out there, it's something that's never been done before, it's a very aggressive plan.' We took that to mean she was hedging."
Mr. Hinchey added that Mrs. Whitman said she was concerned that the decision would affect other sites by setting a precedent. "She was concerned about the scope of it," he said.
Environmental groups became alarmed that the plan, first proposed by the Clinton administration, would be compromised, and key Republicans began pressuring the administration. Several environmental groups said today that they believed that Mr. Pataki's July 24 call to Mrs. Whitman expressing his concern signaled a turning point in her thinking.
Laura Haight, a senior environmental associate with the New York Public Interest Research Group, reminded Mrs. Whitman of the political consequences of her decision. She presented her with a list of five swing Congressional districts in which General Electric was at least partly responsible for toxic waste sites. The groups were planning news media campaigns in those districts and arranging for boycotts of General Electric products.
Ms. Haight said that Mrs. Whitman, while polite, seemed offended. "She said: 'I don't need this. This decision will be based on the science.' "

HEADLINE: Factory Index: A Year of Decline 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 

 BODY:
The slump in manufacturing extended its run in July to a year, but might be moving toward a rebound in coming months, a major purchasing survey suggested today.
 The survey, the National Association of Purchasing Management's factory index, dropped last month to 43.6 from 44.7 in June. 
 A reading of less than 50 signals contraction, and the 12-month stretch below that level is the longest since 1990-91, during the last recession. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that construction spending fell unexpectedly sharply in June. Spending fell 0.7 percent, the biggest drop since July 2000, to $861.6 billion at an annual pace, after a more modest decline of 0.2 percent in May. Work slowed on schools, apartments, town houses and condominiums, outweighing an increase in construction of single-family houses.
Economists had expected a reading of 44.5 in the factory index. The new-orders index, which accounts for 30 percent of the total survey, fell to 46.3 in July from 48.6 in June.
Manufacturing is "bouncing along the bottom," said Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. The report showed that companies were eliminating excess inventory at a faster pace, which "is precisely why you would expect a rebound of production down the road," he said.
Other measures gave signs that manufacturing could rebound. The inventories index fell to 35.8, the lowest since December 1982, from 40.8. The index of production rose to the highest since November. The index of orders for export rose to 48.2, the highest since 50.6 in March. An index measuring backlogs of orders increased. The employment index rose to 37.2 from 36.3.
Price pressure eased. The index of prices paid for raw materials fell to 38.7 in July, the lowest since February 1999, from 42.3 in June. Among metals, slower demand has reduced the price of copper to its lowest level in more than two years.
A big problem has been the excess of telecommunications equipment that developed after a nine-month slump in capital spending began late last year. Producers of fiber optic equipment like JDS Uniphase and Corning are receiving fewer orders, with some of the largest customers of JDS, including Nortel Networks, saying that they will draw down inventories before ordering further.

Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* AFRICAN GALLERIES, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (on long-term view). The museum has one of the oldest and most important collections of African art in the country. Just a few years ago, 250 objects from the permanent collection were installed in revamped first-floor galleries; now two dozen pieces have been added and the space has been redesigned again, this time with multicolored walls, mural-size color photographs, documentary films and ambient sound. Added works expand the definition of African to include both Moroccon and ancient Nubian. And the overall selection, from familiar friends to treasures recently acquired, is thrilling. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 62+ (Holland Cotter).

"MARC CHAGALL: EARLY WORKS FROM RUSSIAN COLLECTIONS," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Oct. 14). When Chagall returned to Russia in 1914 after four years in Paris, he intended to marry his beloved fiancee, Bella Rosenfeld, and hurry back to the French capital. Instead, World War I and the Russian Revolution kept him in his homeland for eight years, during which he did some of his greatest work. The 60 artworks here, most being exhibited in the West for the first time, form a series of intense Chagallian doses rather than a comprehensive overview. They are accompanied by nine paintings by Chagall's first teacher, the sensitive realist Yehuda Pen. The show culminates in the seven large, deliriously inventive murals Chagall made for the Jewish State Chamber Theater in Moscow during three feverish months in 1920. Hours: Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Tuesdays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50 for students and 65+ ($2 surcharge for "Chagall") (Roberta Smith).

* JACQUES AND NATASHA GELMAN GALLERIES, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (continuing). These glorious new galleries display 50 French modern works, almost all paintings, drawn from the Gelmans' collection. In addition to the paintings here, the collection includes five sculptures, more than 30 drawings and a major work on paper: a Matisse cutout, the Met's first, which will be shown in a subsequent hanging. The standouts installed here include Matisse's Fauve masterpiece "The Young Sailor II"; a matched set of small, classic Cubist paintings, one by Picasso, one by Braque, both from 1911, arguably the high point of their collaboration; and a fantastically refined, sexually fraught 1929 Dali, "Accommodations of Desires." It makes the museum a modern art destination in a way that it has never quite been before. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Smith).

"LEON GOLUB: PAINTINGS, 1950-2000," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Aug. 19). Now 79, Mr. Golub is best known for paintings done in the 1970's and 80's, raw, awkward figurative works that seek to illuminate his basic theme, man's inhumanity to man. They include huge, engulfing canvases of Vietnam War scenes, riots, interrogations, death squads, racial face-offs and other grim tableaux in which power confronts the powerless. The set piece here is the enormous "Vietnam II" (1973), whose cinematic-scale canvas depicts two groups of figures, a trio of soldiers and a tank pointing guns at a scraggly group of terrified Vietnamese, led by a young man screaming. As a graphic rendering of might asserting its rights over weakness, it delivers its message with impact. Recently he has dwelled with wit more on philosophical themes, referring often to the frailty of the individual and the inevitable end. Whatever the infelicities of his style, he has steadfastly stuck to his role as witness to the world's evil workings. Hours and admission: See above (Grace Glueck).

* WILLIAM KENTRIDGE, New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Sept. 16). By way of drawings and film animations, Mr. Kentridge uses searing images to address South Africa and its racial problems, along with the longings and frustrations of bourgeois lives played out in the country's deeply dysfunctional setting. The exhibition begins with his jarring "Shadow Procession" (1999), a ragtag parade of silhouetted moving images projected on a big screen, which evokes the displaced and dispossessed who haunt not only South Africa but also the history of the world. At the heart of the show are his drawings and the short animated films he makes of them, in which the process shares importance with the content. Many of the films contrast the lives of two antiheroes, one a crude rapacious businessman, the other a sensitive artist, in compelling medleys of images that touch on the personal and the political. Departing from this format is "Ubu Tells the Truth" (1997), a highly charged satire based on the hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up in 1995 to investigate human rights abuses in the apartheid era. It's not often that good art is shaped from such raw angry material, but Mr. Kentridge's powers of invention are equal to the challenge. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students, artists and 65+ (Glueck).

* "MASTER DRAWINGS FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART," Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through Aug. 19). From Michelangelo to Louise Bourgeois, from Rembrandt to Franz Kline, this cornucopia of drawings from one of the most important collections in the United States bristles with the work of stellar talents. A standout is a double-sided drawing in red chalk by Michelangelo, probably done around 1510-11. One side reveals the trouble he had sketching a foot that fits the position of a youthful male nude on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel; the other shows the headless nude, a powerful, ingeniously posed figure that emphasizes the sculptor's magnificent grasp of anatomical rendering. A rare compositional drawing by Fra Filippo Lippi, a subtly toned landscape by Claude Lorrain, a scene of battling horses by Gericault, a stately portrait by Ingres, one of Seurat's brilliant black crayon drawings of a French vaudeville scene and works by Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec are among the highlights. The 20th-century American group is something of a disappointment, but there are enough great things from other eras to make this a masterpiece of a show. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6 for students and 65+ (Glueck).

"MASTER DRAWINGS FROM THE SMITH COLLEGE MUSEUM OF ART," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Aug. 12). This selection of drawings spanning six centuries has compelling works on paper by some of the more resonant names in Western art history, names like Tiepolo, Boucher, Ingres, Gericault, Beardsley, van Gogh, Mondrian and others. There are works of only academic proficiency, but in far more cases the drawing sings: in the 15th-century Italian Rosso Fiorentino's near-orgiastic vision of a double martyrdom made with urgent sensuousness in red chalk, for example, or Seurat's studies for "La Grande Jatte," in which broad, deft swipes of a black crayon evoke the silhouettes of women who seem almost dissolved by watery light. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 62+ (Ken Johnson).

* "MIGRATIONS: HUMANITY IN TRANSITION," photographs by Sebastiao Salgado, International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 860-1777 (through Sept. 9). The show (there are two accompanying books) is the product of seven years in more than 35 countries documenting what Mr. Salgado calls "the reorganization of the human family," partly because of the shift from "majority rural to majority urban." His subjects are refugees, exiles, orphans, landless peasants, homeless families, boat people, internees and others. This is a sprawling, frequently gruesome story -- the scale and gravity of it should speak for themselves -- and if the suffering doesn't prompt guilt, indifference to it will. That's how emotional blackmail and effective moral photojournalism work. Mr. Salgado practices both as well as anyone does these days. Of course, the pictures are also exploitative, but that's also a feature of photojournalism. We respond despite the voyeurism and the manipulation because of the formal beauty. The good photographs are so stupendously gorgeous that, for better and worse, they can make you forget everything else while you are looking at them. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6 for students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* WAYNE THIEBAUD: A PAINTINGS RETROSPECTIVE," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Sept. 23). The world not being a perfect place, this show will be around only through the summer, so consider yourself forewarned. At the Whitney, as in life, happiness is fleeting. Meanwhile, you are free to bask in these pumpkin pies, meat and cheese deli counters, lipsticks, hot dogs and gumball machines, which, as Mr. Thiebaud has painted them for the last 40 years, have the aura of loves lost and too fondly recalled. Joy yielding to melancholy then yields to the less jolting but more durable satisfaction of being in the presence of pictures so lovingly and wittily made. These pictures provoke happiness if for no other reason than that they are content to be what they are, which is enough, this being the same message they convey about the modest objects and people they depict. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8 for students and 62+ (Kimmelman).

* "UNIFORM: ORDER AND DISORDER," P.S. 1 Center for Contemporary Art, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Sept. 3). Originally shown in Italy, this exhibition traces the changing forms and symbolism of the modern military uniform as it progresses through the larger culture and is transformed by it: alternately respected and violated, examined and absorbed, abbreviated and exaggerated. The perpetrators include artists like Wolfgang Tillmans, Vanessa Beecroft and Maurizio Cattelan; fashion designers like Prada, Versace and Donna Karan; and scores of terrorists, punks and nameless teenagers. Eight well-stocked vitrines present a plethora of supporting material, much of which is also reproduced in a stylish catalog. The exhibition ends with the real thing: a gantlet of the uniforms and head gear -- from fatigues to parade dress -- worn by members of the different Italian military services. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2, students and 62+ (Smith).

Galleries: Uptown

"MINIMAL," Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677 (through Aug. 10; reopens Aug. 27 to 31). This elegant show includes works of classic Minimalism like a box made of stainless steel and fluorescent red Plexiglas by Donald Judd; an iconic arrangement of red, pink and yellow fluorescent lights by Dan Flavin; and a gorgeous, glossy red, thick plank shape by John McCracken. It also embraces more conceptually motivated works, like words on the wall by Lawrence Weiner that say "Around the bend"; a square of typewritten concrete poetry by Carl Andre; and photographs of framework houses by Bernd and Hilla Becher (Johnson).

* "POP ART: THE JOHN AND KIMIKO POWERS COLLECTION," Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 77th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through Aug. 31). With his Japanese-born wife, Kimiko, John Powers (1916-1999), a former president of the Prentice-Hall publishing company, gathered a big-bang collection of Pop Art by the movement's stars. The 26 objects shown here are mostly from the 1960's, and they bring a whole era back into vivid focus. (Glueck).

"SALT OF THE EARTH," Bettina Werner, Winston Wachter Mayer, 39 East 78th Street, (212) 327-2526 (through Aug. 15). With unabashed grandiosity, Ms. Werner calls herself the "Queen of Salt." Since the 1980's she has specialized in making abstract paintings using colored salt crystals in various grades, from sandy to chunky, as her primary medium. She evidently wants to be some kind of 21st-century alchemist, but her multipaneled pictures are formally generic. Maybe they should be saltier (Johnson).

"SERIAL THINKING," Kouros, 23 East 73rd Street, (212) 288-5888 (through Aug. 31). Zeuxis, an organization of still-life painters, presents works by more than two dozen artists, most represented by multiple versions of a single motif. Some impressive works stand out against the earnestly academic background, including Victor Pesces's iconic, subtly humorous pictures of isolated cups; Suzanne Biggins's small close-up studies of matches, which verge on grid-based abstraction; and Lucy Barber's hazy images of objects that seem almost dissolved by light and heat (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

MORRIS GRAVES, "Still Life," Schmidt Bingham, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 888-1122 (through Aug. 17). This small retrospective honors a great American original who died in May at 90. Ranging from vigorously palette-knifed paintings of drinking fountains from the 1930's to exquisitely delicate pictures of flowers in transparent bottles from the 90's, the show gives a fine taste of Graves's craftsmanlike versatility and his modest yet intense poetic sensibility (Johnson).

"MINIMALISM PAST AND PRESENCE," Galerie Lelong, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 315-0470 (through Aug. 15). For its final exhibition before moving to Chelsea, Lelong presents a retrospective of Minimalist or near-Minimalist artists who have exhibited here over the years, including Robert Ryman, Robert Mangold and Donald Judd. Alfredo Jaar's lightbox-lighted Social Realist photograph, Sean Scully's loose stripe paintings and Ana Mendieta's photograph of an earthwork undermine the show's coherence, but being definitive seems not to be the point (Johnson).

"NO BIG PICTURES," Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999 (through Aug. 29). Tired of oversized, overproduced, conceptually coy contemporary photographs? This show of small-to-tiny vintage prints is for you. It includes William Christenberry's beautiful image of a red truck trailer in a green field; Harry Callahan's serene image of a volleyball net on a deserted Cape Cod beach; zany, slightly creepy "auto-Polaroids" by Lucas Samaras; an absorbing short story told in four color Polaroids by Philip-Lorca DiCorcia; and Diane Arbus's touching portrait of a young waitress at a nudist camp wearing only an apron (Johnson).

* CARLO SAMMARCO, Franklin Parrasch, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360 (through Aug. 31). Richly glazed and textured, Mr. Sammarco's pedestal scale compositions of elemental geometric shapes have a coolly refreshing beauty. "Subscape," an architectonic complex of square-walled circle sections glazed in smooth red brick, matte moss green and granular charcoal gray, shows off this promising young artist's consummate craftsmanship and suave way with color (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

MEREDITH ALLEN, Gracie Mansion, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 505-9577 (through Aug.31) In each of Ms. Allen's silly but charming photographs, someone's hand holds up a melting Good Humor bar in the barely recognizable form of a cartoon character like Tweety Bird or the Tasmanian Devil. In the distance are blurred Long Island landscapes, setting up a dialogue between culture and nature and, possibly, between painting -- represented by the gooey, drippy, brightly colored ice cream -- and photography (Johnson).

"CAMERA WORKS: THE PHOTOGRAPHIC IMPULSE IN CONTEMPORARY ART," Marianne Boesky Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9889 (through Aug. 10). Despite the encompassing title, this show focuses almost exclusively on photographs by 31 established artists, mostly in their 30's and 40's, who are not known primarily, if at all, for working with the camera. Usual suspects are in the majority, from Ross Bleckner to Lisa Yuskavage, with Peter Doig, Jessica Stockholder, Rachel Whiteread and Gregor Schneider in between. But there are still plenty of surprises and revelations, especially when you find yourself thinking that some of the assembled should stick to photography (Smith).

"ELECTRIFY ME!" Friedrich Petzel, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9467 (through Aug. 10). This judiciously selected (by the curator Mark Fletcher) and beautifully installed exhibition of sculptures that use electric light includes a heart-shaped neon sign with a funny but unprintable message by Tim Noble and Sue Webster; a window of cool light by James Turrell; Jorge Pardo's lamps of thick glass scattered on the floor and looking vaguely like collapsing squashes; an elegiac string of bulbs by Felix Gonzalez-Torres; and a neon palindrome by Bruce Nauman. Only Rachel Whiteread's aluminum cast of an electrical switch box doesn't light up (Johnson).

ENEAS, "Thriller," Esso, 211 West 28th Street, (212) 560-9728 (through Aug. 16). Every canvas in this empty but archly sophisticated display of insider gamesmanship has the name Michael Jackson stenciled across the top above a skillful simulation of gesture or drip painting by Jackson Pollock, who shares a name with the mercurial pop star. These works so closely resemble George Condo's jazz album cover paintings that you can't help suspecting the sly Condo might have invented Eneas (Johnson).

"50'S PHYSIQUE: VINTAGE BODYBUILDING PHOTOGRAPHY," Wessel & O'Connor Gallery, 242 West 26th Street, (212) 242-8811 (through Aug. 24). This is a kind of summer idyll from yesterday, with beaches and mountains for settings, sun-tanned bodies galore, and everyone having good, clean, fabulous fun. The young men seen in the 90 photographs were posing for discreetly distributed, small-format physique magazines that had an ardent gay following in the pre-Stonewall 1950s. Among the masters of the genre were Bruce of Los Angeles (Bruce Bellas, 1907-1974) and Bob Mizer (1922-1992), both well-represented here. For students of popular culture, the material is a gold mine. For everyone else, its a chance to stare, smirk and swoon the summer away (Cotter).

"FOUR ABSTRACT CLASSICISTS," Gary Snyder, 601 West 29th Street, (212) 871-1077 (through Aug. 25). This punchy time capsule of a show features works from the 1950's and 60's by four West Coast painters of hard-edged abstraction -- Karl Benjamin, Lorser Feitelson, Frederick Hammersley and John McLaughlin. The exhibition recalls a generational shift away from Abstract Expressionism toward the cooler aesthetics of the 1960's. Its title invites reflection on the tension in reductive abstraction between historical avant-gardism and timeless formalism (Johnson).

RICHARD HAMILTON, "Prints, 1968-1998," Charles Cowles Gallery, 537 West 24th Street, (212) 925-3500 (through Aug. 17). James Joyce's "Ulysses" and tabloid subjects like Mick Jagger's arrest for drug possession are part of the huge print repertory of the English painter Richard Hamilton. Mr. Hamilton is wide-ranging not only in subject matter but also in print technique; while not dispensing with venerable practices like etching and engraving, he sets no limits on technical possibilities, fooling around with contemporary techniques from silk-screening to computer manipulation of digital images, sometimes using several in the same print. This wonderfully animated show illustrates his belief that images will always be more important than the manner of their execution. But it also reveals the role that technical innovation plays in the impact of his graphic work (Glueck).

CRAIG KAUFFMAN, Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183 (through Aug. 31). This Fetish Finish artist of Los Angeles is still producing Minimalistic, super-slick, vacuum-formed plastic wall reliefs. Each piece in this show is shaped like a bottom-heavy doughnut and spray-painted from behind in frosty, pearlescent colors that call to mind fingernail polish. Possessed of a weirdly artificial, vaguely erotic and futuristic beauty, they could be props for a "Clockwork Orange" milkbar (Johnson).

"LARGER THAN LIFE," Center for Figurative Painting, 115 West 30th Street, (212) 868-3452 (through Sept. 28). The standouts in this five-artist show are two painters of opposite but equally ambitious sensibility: Leland Bell, whose large, perfectly composed figure compositions project an Apollonian love of order and clarity, and Paul Georges, a passionate hedonist whose big, recklessly vigorous painting of wild pink roses under a bright blue sky evokes a summer day to almost unbearably delightful effect (Johnson).

"PHOTOPLAYS FROM THE 60's," James Bidgood, Paul Morris, 465 West 23rd Street, (212) 727-2752 (through Aug. 17). Creator of the cult film "Pink Narcissus" (1971), Mr. Bidgood made dreamy, homoerotic photographs in the 1960's. Using colored lights and cheap materials, he staged blatantly fake scenes in settings ranging from the boudoir to the beach. They featured partially unclothed youths playing characters like a toreador or a faun. Seen here as new digital prints, the images are less shocking than you might wish; still, Mr. Bidgood deserves credit for being a brave pioneer (Johnson).

PETER PINCHBECK, "A Memorial Exhibition," Greene Naftali, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 463-7770 (through Aug. 10). Mr. Pinchbeck, a British-born New Yorker who died a year ago, began as an Abstract Expressionist painter in the 1960's, turned to Minimalist sculpture and then went back to painting. The recent pictures on view here have sensuously textured, chromatically intense surfaces and, hovering in ambiguously illusory space, bulbous forms made of generously slathered paint. These works are hedonistic, a little comical and mysteriously elemental (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

"INTIMATE: A GROUP EXPERIENCE," Scalo, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 334-9393 (through Aug. 30). Contrary to the title, the pictures in this show could just as well be used to demonstrate photography's distancing effects. They include blurry, surveillance-style pictures of a man sleeping, by Marianne Muller; Social Realist family pictures shot in Kentucky, Morocco and Colombia by Wendy Ewald; male odalisques by David Armstrong; compositions of bed sheets and parts of naked bodies by Jeanette Montgomery Barron; and, most arresting, Edward Quinn's picture of a baby-faced Warren Beatty helping a transcendentally sexy Natalie Wood with her coat in Cannes (Johnson).

"STRUCTURES," Work Space, 96 Spring Street, (212) 219-2790 (through Aug. 31). This gallery in a law office presents yet another interesting guest-produced group show. Organized by Linda Francis and Marjorie Welish, and featuring artists variously preoccupied by geometry, it includes a lumpy, hovering box with a gridded surface by James Hyde; a glossy black spot on a mossy green field by Thomas Nozkowski; a spare, emblematic diptych by Ms. Francis; and diverse approaches to the grid by Ms. Wellish, Michael Brennan, Nancy Haynes and Kes Zapkus (Johnson).

"SURF'S UP! SURFING PHOTOGRAPHY FROM 1922 TO 1942," by Tom Blake and Don James," Ariel Meyerowitz, 580 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 625-3434 (through Aug. 10). Blake and James got into surfing and photographing surfers long before the Beach Boys made it a national craze. Blake's pictures from the 1920's and early 30's and James's from the late 30's and early 40's are shown here in the form of poster-size digital prints made from original negatives. The warm-toned, often blurry images of men riding waves on long boards look at once nostalgically antique and fashionably contemporary (Johnson).

Other Galleries

TONY CRAGG, "Turbo-Ferryman," Doris C. Freedman Plaza, Fifth Avenue and 60th Street, (212) 980-4575 (through October). This year's Public Art Fund installation here consists of two bulbous bronze sculptures by a consistently interesting British sculptor. One is a perforated, biomorphic bottlelike form with wiggly arms going in and out of its body; the other is a big, asymmetrical shape, like a toy top with odd lumpy places. In a gallery either would be fine; outdoors they look too small. If one or the other were five times larger, it would be terrific (Johnson).

Last Chance

* "AFRICAN FORMS," Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Wednesday). This show forgoes the figurative sculptures and masks that made African art a foundation of Western modernism to concentrate on supposedly humbler stuff, objects of physical adornment and daily use. With some 400 objects created by 156 ethnic groups, it proceeds in clusters of related carved wood neck rests, stools and boxes; ivory hairpins and snuff bottles; all kinds of jewelry; baskets and ceramic vessels; and spoons, weapons and musical instruments. The show is pervaded by an elegance, an economy of form and a sensitivity to materials that is both intensely spiritual and protomodern. Figurative sculpture and masks may be the "high art" of Africa, but there is no low. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+ (Smith).

ALEXANDER LIBERMAN, "Maquettes for Monuments," Ameringer/Howard, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 935-1110 (through today). In the late 1960's, this Modernist sculptor and Conde Nast editorial director produced gigantic abstractions using old, unearthed gas pipes. On view here are sleek little copies of those monumental works, compositions of standing, leaning or tumbling cylinders finished in glossy red or matte rust-colored patina. Though not deeply consequential, they are appealingly precious (Johnson).

"VOICE, IMAGE, GESTURE: SELECTIONS FROM THE JEWISH MUSEUM'S COLLECTION, 1945-2000," Jewish Museum, 1195 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Sunday). Though not by any means an exhibition of great art, this show offers a thought-provoking occasion to meditate on relations between contemporary art and Jewish identity. The 60-odd works include Abstract Expressionist paintings by Adolph Gottlieb and Robert Motherwell; Andy Warhol's Pop-style silkscreen series "10 Portraits of Jews in the 20th Century"; a campy contemporary skullcap by Cary Liebowitz and a deconstructed menorah made of low-tech electrical hardware by Michael McCaslin. Television and movie clips feature Jewish luminaries like Woody Allen and Sandy Koufax. A painting by R. B. Kitaj based on a 15th-century depiction of an antisemitic myth is the show's most suggestively allusive work. Hours and admission: See above (Johnson)

"VOYAGES: A SMITHSONIAN LIBRARIES EXHIBITION," Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, (212) 838-6690 (through tomorrow). Mostly a selection of mostly rare books with some curious objects also, "Voyages" offers a miniature cross section of the vast holdings of the Smithsonian Institution Libraries. Contents range from remarkable antiquities like "Mundus Subterraneus" by the 17th-century Dutch scholar Athanasius Kircher, thought to be the earliest printed study of geophysics and vulcanology, to a copy of Neil Armstrong's "Stroll on the Moon," which is signed by the author and the fellow astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins (Johnson).

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES; 
Lumumba, the African Castro or a Dazzling Ray of Hope?

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
THE ASSASSINATION OF LUMUMBA
By Ludo De Witte
Translated by Ann Wright and Renee Fenby.
Illustrated. 224 pages. Verso. $27.
 Patrice Lumumba was one of those charismatic figures -- martyrs, in the view of their supporters -- who stood on the public stage during that moment of ferment when colonialism was dying and a new force on the global scene, third world nationalism, seemed poised to replace it. Lumumba, who was assassinated in January 1961 during the terrible Congo civil war, was like Che Guevara in this sense, or perhaps Sukarno (overthrown but not assassinated in Indonesia), or maybe even the American Black Muslim Malcolm X. He was a fiery, commanding figure with a revolutionary aura about him, cut down before he was able to exercise power long enough for anybody to be sure how he would have reshaped the world. 
 In one view, the view that has predominated in the seats of Western power, Lumumba was a dangerous figure who would have taken the newly independent Congo either into social chaos or into the Soviet camp. The director of central intelligence at the time, Allen Dulles, called him an African Castro. By contrast, Ludo De Witte, a Belgian sociologist and writer, takes a very different view in "The Assassination of Lumumba."
For Mr. De Witte, Lumumba was a dazzling ray of hope for a successful postcolonial future in Africa, a man who might have led Congo, reluctantly granted independence by Belgium after a century of rapacious control, into a hopeful future. Mr. De Witte's thesis is that Lumumba's murder was not, as many have previously written, an internal Congolese affair, a kind of panicked overreaction among African factions fighting it out after the departure of the Belgians. Lumumba was murdered, in Mr. De Witte's account, by a kind of unholy alliance led by the Belgian government acting through well-paid Congolese stooges and enjoying the connivance of the American Central Intelligence Agency and the United Nations.
Mr. De Witte's book, translated from the Flemish by Ann Wright and Renee Fenby, is an important and flawed examination of the persecution and murder of Lumumba. Mr. De Witte makes no pretense of being an impartial investigator. His book is full of a kind of impassioned boilerplate more common to the leftist intelligentsia in Europe than in the United States, phrases like "the Western ruling classes" and "the fight for national liberation" abound. At one point, after he has taken the reader through a gripping, minute-by-minute account of Lumumba's execution, Mr. De Witte laments: 
"Patrice Lumumba was not yet 36 years old, the same age as Robespierre, that other great defender of the modern nation state, when he died." To put Lumumba into the same category as the man who invented revolutionary terror seems at best tactically unwise; it does not inspire confidence in Mr. De Witte's political judgment.
Still, whatever eccentric political ideas he may have, Mr. De Witte has written a compelling account of the tireless efforts by the West to eliminate Lumumba. When this book was published in Europe in 1999, it prompted the formation of a Belgian parliamentary inquiry into Lumumba's death. (Its findings are to be announced this year.) Mr. De Witte makes his case, and he has documentary evidence to make it stick.
Lumumba was the first prime minister elected in Congo before a reluctant Belgium granted it independence in July 1960, but matters began to deteriorate almost immediately. Lumumba made an inflammatory speech at the independence ceremony, attacking Belgium for its years of colonialist exploitation and humiliation while King Baudouin stood nearby. Lumumba's attack was historically accurate but politically foolish. It aroused fears among Europeans that antiwhite vengeance would be a main theme of his regime.
Within a couple of days, when the Congolese army revolted, beating European men and raping some women, Belgium intervened militarily, and though Belgian troops were soon displaced by a United Nations multinational force, Lumumba was soon dismissed by President Joseph Kasavubu. When he tried to escape house arrest in Leopoldville and join supporters in Stanleyville, he was arrested by troops controlled by the future dictator, Joseph Mubutu. A few months later, in the presence of several Belgian police and army officers, he was beaten, tortured and executed by a firing squad.
It is a seedy story, and the essential fact of it is indisputable: that the legally elected prime minister of a newly independent country was murdered, to the evident satisfaction both of Belgium and the United States. Much of what Mr. De Witte says in his detailed reconstruction of the crime has been known for years, including the almost comic-opera plot concocted by the C.I.A. to have Lumumba assassinated by injecting poison into his toothpaste.
Mr. De Witte mines the Belgian archives for a good deal of new information, especially on the role of ranking figures in the Belgian government in fomenting opposition to Lumumba among alternative Congolese leaders. Once Lumumba was arrested, Mr. De Witte's reconstruction of events says, Belgium pressed for what a senior Belgian official called his "definitive elimination." Mr. De Witte and his translators maintain the original French phrase: "elimination definitive."
But De Witte also slides quickly over the breakdown in order after the independence-day celebrations. In this book you won't read about the rape of European women, for example, or of Lumumba's inability to control the situation, or of his tendency to make inflammatory declarations. While Mr. De Witte meticulously describes Belgian economic interests in its former colony, he does not talk much about the Congo's powerful tribal and personal rivalries, which other commentators have stressed. You would almost think, reading Mr. De Witte's account, that the murder of Lumumba was unusual in Africa at the time. In truth, throughout the continent, corrupt and brutal army officers of the Mobutu stripe were taking power from the Western-trained intellectuals that the departing colonial powers had left behind to run things.
But it is also true that Congo was different in some ways, different because of the unusual cruelty of Belgian colonialism (grippingly recounted in Adam Hochschild's recent book "King Leopold's Ghost") and because of the exceptional brutality and corruption of the Mobutu regime after Lumumba's fall. Mr. De Witte's book, politically passionate as it is, is an unignorable effort to bring the West face to face with its culpability in this entire sad and sanguinary tale.

HEADLINE: WATCHING MOVIES WITH: WOODY ALLEN; 
Coming Back To 'Shane'

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

 BODY:
HE came into his screening room walking that Woody Allen walk, slightly hunched, a little distracted, his vigorous fingers carving the air as he spoke. "I hope you don't mind," he said, "but I have prepared a statement."
 And he pulled from his pocket a folded sheet of canary-colored paper, the double-spaced letters overlaid with black-ink editing that spilled into the margins. Mr. Allen said he wanted to make completely clear why he had chosen George Stevens's "Shane" as the film he wanted to watch. 
 "I'll just read this into your tape recorder, if that's O.K., and then you can do whatever you want with it after that," he said, settling himself in a plush chair in the back corner of the screening room. "Is it on? Can I start talking?" 
He held up the canary sheet and began. "When I was invited to pick a film to view and discuss with The New York Times, I wanted to select an American one," Mr. Allen said. "This is unusual for me, because my affection for foreign movies seems to be much deeper. If I were, for example, to list my 10 or even 15 favorite movies -- and I don't say best movies, because these lists are always completely subjective -- aside from 'Citizen Kane,' all of the films would be foreign. A sampling might be, 'Rashomon,' 'The Bicycle Thief,' 'Grand Illusion,' 'Wild Strawberries,' 'Seventh Seal,' 'Throne of Blood,' 'The 400 Blows,' 'Los Olvidados,' you get the idea."
He cleared his throat, took a deep breath and continued: "But I didn't want to do that for this, because I wanted to make sure that the people who read this, at least a portion of them, have seen the movie, so I thought I would stay with an American movie. I hesitated, too, about viewing a comedy, because on a list I might make of, let's say, the 10 or 15 great American films, there'd be almost no comedies. Certainly not from the talking era. And I wouldn't include the silent era, because that is a completely different entity. Silent films to me are a completely different kind of thing. If you were to count silent films, of course, between Chaplin and Keaton you could probably get 10 great movies. But if you take films only from the start of the sound era, I don't think that there are too many great sound comedies." Mr. Allen, 65, hunched forward and spoke slowly into the recorder, never looking up from the typewritten sheet. (And it had indeed been pecked out on a typewriter, not printed from a computer.)
He wore khaki pants and a button-down blue shirt, long-sleeved and fastened at the wrist, and despite the sweltering summer afternoon he was perfectly dry, pressed and unruffled.
"I have a very idiosyncratic view of sound comedies that I wouldn't want to interfere with this," he said. "For example, I wouldn't count the Marx brothers or W. C. Fields films, I wouldn't put them on my great list, as I don't consider their films great. But they are records of performances by these stupendous comedians, and any five minutes of Groucho or Fields is funnier than most purported or even venerated comedies. And still I wouldn't rank their movies, which I find, you know, choppy and even silly, as great comic filmmaking. I would say my personal view of most sound era comedies would be considered harsh, and I certainly include my own films in that appraisal. None of them would be on any of these great lists, certainly."

'A Great Movie'
There is a scene in Mr. Allen's "Manhattan" in which Isaac, the character he plays in the 1979 film, reclines on a sofa in his New York apartment and recites into a tape recorder a list of what he holds most dear in the world, from city landmarks to creative works like Flaubert's "Sentimental Education." It is difficult to watch Mr. Allen read his "Shane" statement into a similar tape recorder without catching at least an echo of Isaac's streaming, punctilious manifesto.
"For whatever reason, I am not enchanted by a huge number of highly respected comedies, whose names I would rather not mention and hurt anybody's feelings," Mr. Allen said. "I do consider 'The Shop Around the Corner' a great comic movie, also 'Trouble in Paradise,' also 'Born Yesterday.' Speaking of 'Born Yesterday,' I considered the British version of 'Pygmalion' with Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller, and also the Fellini masterpiece 'The White Sheik.' Since I spent most of my life in comedy, in one medium or another, I am not a clean, objective judge. I would prefer not to harp on my highly special preferences and distastes. As musical comedy goes, I do consider 'Singin' in the Rain,' 'Meet Me in St. Louis' and 'Gigi' great, and probably 'My Fair Lady' would have to be ranked up there.
"In the end, looking over my list of great American films, which include, among others, for final consideration, 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,' 'White Heat,' 'Double Indemnity,' 'The Informer' and 'The Hill' by Sidney Lumet, I finally settled on 'Shane.' This is an odd choice in one sense, because I don't like westerns. I like 'The Ox-Bow Incident' and 'High Noon' and care a bit but considerably less about a few others, but 'Shane,' I think, is a great movie and can hold its own with any film, whether it's a western or not."
Mr. Allen looked up from the piece of paper. "That's the only statement I wanted to make," he said, handing over the typewritten sheet along with the still turning recorder. His editing marks cover the entire statement, words are crossed out, entire clauses inserted from the margins.
He nervously cleared his throat again and stood up, peering back into the projection booth where someone was waiting to crank up the first reel of "Shane." The cluttered suite of Park Avenue offices where Mr. Allen edits his films and maintains a screening room is completely free of the kind of blinking high-tech gizmos with which other directors surround themselves. The editing equipment, the upholstered furniture, even the copious collection of vinyl jazz albums that line one entire wall all seem like throwbacks to an earlier, analog era, as well worn as the love seat where Mr. Allen finally came to rest facing the screen.
"I saw 'Shane' when it first came out in theaters," Mr. Allen said. That would have been in 1953, when he was just getting out of high school in Brooklyn. "I didn't rush off to see it," he said, "because there's no western film that I ever rush off to see. I'm not really that interested -- and, again, this is purely personal -- by rural atmospheres. So when a film begins in a farmhouse or something, it's not the same for me as if it begins in a penthouse. I just like an urban setting."
So just why, then, did he choose "Shane"?
"I thought 'The Ox-Bow Incident' was wonderful when I saw it, and 'High Noon' is a good western, for me," he said. "But none of them hold a candle to 'Shane.' 'Shane' is in a class by itself, because if I was making a list of the best American movies, 'Shane' would be on it, and none of these other movies would."
The reason, in large part, is the great skill of Stevens, Mr. Allen said. "I rank him very high. And this is on the basis of a very few things, really. The few of his films that I've liked, I've liked very much. 'Shane,' I think, is his masterpiece. I do think he would be right up there with my very few favorite American directors -- of the era that I grew up in. Orson Welles is in a class by himself, but then, you know, John Huston and George Stevens and William Wyler."

A Score of Viewings
Mr. Allen remembered enjoying "Shane" from the first time he saw it, but he said his appreciation had deepened over the years. "I've seen it many, many times," he said. "Certainly more than 20. I've also taken people to see it, people who tell me that they can't stand westerns. Because it's more than a western. It's a fine movie. Oh, there are a couple of weaker spots in it, but they are so minor and forgivable, and what's great about it is so wonderful, that you'd really have to be carping to be annoyed at them. To this day, if it was on television this week and I happened to be tuning through the channels, I would stop and see it. I am always riveted."
Mr. Allen frequently describes "Shane" as a lovely film, or a beautiful one, and praises it for its poetry and elegant flow, words not normally associated with westerns. Two of his favorite westerns, it is pointed out, are essentially a long buildup to a climactic confrontation. In "Shane" it is Alan Ladd's reluctant gunfighter strapping his six-shooter back on to do battle for the beleaguered homesteaders; in "High Noon" it is Gary Cooper taking on the killer who has arrived on the noon train.
"Yes," Mr. Allen said, letting the notion sink in for a moment. "But if you were asking me, I would say that 'Shane' achieves a certain poetry that 'High Noon' doesn't. 'High Noon' is beautifully made, but you can see the message of it too plainly, you know, and it's just not as well done. For whatever reason, probably because Stevens himself had some of the poet in him, it infuses that material with a certain poetry that 'High Noon' doesn't have. 'High Noon' is more like a fine piece of work, you know, whereas 'Shane' is sort of a fine piece of poetry."'
Mr. Allen leaned over, twisted the volume knob on a console beside his seat and shouted back to the man in the projection booth. The familiar blast of Victor Young's classic score erupts behind the Paramount Pictures logo, pushing into the classic opening shot of the wandering gunfighter cresting a hill and passing down into the troubled valley where the drama will take place.
The colors in the print are a little bled out, which is a shame, because the images of the craggy peaks of northwest Wyoming, where Stevens shot the film, are among the most beautiful in any western. Did Mr. Allen have any idea where the film was shot? "No idea," he said in a crisp tone that discouraged further discussion. A subsequent question was cut off just as quickly. Was Mr. Allen going to be able to discuss the film as we watched it? "I can't talk and watch the movie at the same time," he said.
Oh.
This was a bit of a problem, as the discussion is pretty much the idea of this series. But he was adamant -- polite but adamant. He suggested a compromise: we would watch the film for 20 minutes or so, then switch it off and discuss what we had seen before starting it up again.

Just Heading North
Shane glides across the bucolic valley to the remote homestead of the Starrett family, Joe (Van Heflin), Marian (Jean Arthur) and Joey (Brandon de Wilde). He asks to cut through their property, says he's just heading north to "someplace I've never been." When Little Joey absent-mindedly cocks his rifle, Shane snaps around like a gunfighter. When some rough-looking men ride up, Starrett at first thinks Shane is one of them. They are the Ryker brothers and their gang, open-range cattlemen who want to chase off all homesteaders. They threaten Starrett and roar off.
By this time, an embarrassed Starrett realizes that Shane was not with them and invites him to stay for supper. Shane, used to the gunfighter's violent life, is entranced by the gentle domestic scene. After dinner, the two men work to remove a stubborn tree stump in Starrett's yard, and Shane accepts a job on the ranch.
The next day, Shane rides into the nearby town to buy work clothes and is humiliated by one of Ryker's hired men, played by Ben Johnson. At a meeting that night, Stonewall Torrey (Elisha Cook Jr.), one of the homesteaders, and others shun Shane for his supposed cowardice. They decide to ride into town together in the future, and are seen doing just that, a glowering sky lighted by lightning foreshadowing trouble ahead.
"O.K., is this a good place to stop?" Mr. Allen asked. "It is? Fine." He called back to the projectionist.

In the Middle of Nowhere
"I think, first off, you take the film from the beginning, there's that beautiful scenic opening," Mr. Allen said. "The sense of this ranch house that's isolated out there, and then the town, which is one of the great images in American film. It's a town in the middle of nowhere, just a few buildings. I mean, it's just a little general store, a bar, a livery stable, just stuck out in the middle of the wild like that. You have a sense that this is what those Western towns really looked like."
Mr. Allen noted the complex tangle of relationships that are economically sketched out, one by one, in the opening scenes. "From the first, because of the way Stevens shot it, you can tell that there is this intense fascination between the kid and Shane; it's almost love at first sight or something," he said. "And it's wonderful the way he snaps around when the kid cocks his gun, because you know, immediately, that you're dealing with a tough guy. It's done so offhandedly. There are certain things that you don't think in words, that you think emotionally. You know, it clicks in some subliminal way. Here, you think to yourself, oh, I would like to have this guy on my side. So that then later, when he does go on Starrett's side, it's so wish-fulfilling.
"And the bad guys are handled in a great way, too. The first word out of Ryker's mouth is that he doesn't want any trouble. At several points during the movie, Ryker tries to be reasonable. So it's not just a bunch of bullies. It's more complex than that."
The connecting threads of the relationships are built one strand at a time. Even the tough guy who humiliates Shane in the bar comes back into play, later, redeemed and nuanced. But through it all, the overriding mystery is the character of Shane himself; quiet, calm, utterly competent and yet yearning for something. "This guy is not a pushover," Mr. Allen said, "but you have also seen this goodness of spirit that he has. Alan Ladd is an interesting choice for the part because Shane is such a passive character in the whole thing. He's just quiet and passive and nonassertive. And he's a small guy, not a big, beefy cowboy star."

Evil Arrives in the Town
The movie starts up again. Shane and the homesteaders are heading into town. The weather is glowering. Shane, now aware that the homesteaders consider him a coward, wanders back into the bar to confront Ben Johnson. They circle each other, then fight. At first, the homesteaders hang back, fearful. But finally Starrett wades in and the two men take on the entire gang. The Ryker brothers, sensing that the time has come to raise the stakes, send off for a gunfighter. Shortly afterward, Jack Wilson (Jack Palance) rides into town, a reptilian, thoroughly malevolent desperado.
"Watch this," Mr. Allen said, breaking his own rule.
Mr. Palance enters the saloon. A dog looks up, sees him and slinks across the barroom floor. Mr. Palance begins to walk across the room. We see him only from the waist down. Gradually, he dissolves out of the frame and, almost instantly, dissolves back in a few steps further along. It's beautiful, but ghostly. He's like an apparition.
"It's one of the most puzzling dissolves I've ever seen," Mr. Allen said. "I can't imagine what it was for. It must have been to cover up a mistake. I can't think of any other reason for it."
Once Mr. Palance is introduced, the film returns to the farm. Shane is trying to teach Joey how to shoot until Marian comes out and stops it. She doesn't want her boy to have anything to do with guns. It's clear, too, that the unspoken relationship between Marian and Shane is deepening, though nothing ever happens between them that's more physical than a handshake.
"So, when we last left off, they were riding into town, and you could tell that Shane had his own agenda to settle the score with these people," Mr. Allen said. "And then they go home and you get the scene of Marian fixing up the two men, Shane and her husband, and it's so obvious that she's attracted to Shane, and it's starting to bother her. When Shane leaves, she asks her husband to hold her. She's getting to where she can't trust her feelings. This is wonderful stuff for a cowboy movie because it's not heavy-handed. It's a relationship that develops with the same subtlety that it would in the most sophisticated kind of urban movie."
And then there is Jack Palance.
"If any actor has ever created a character who is the personification of evil, it is Jack Palance," Mr. Allen said. "We've all read about the size of the horse, how Stevens put Palance on a smaller horse so he'd look even bigger. But when he arrives -- the music is great -- he's all in black; he's so poetically evil. He looks like he'd gladly kill the guys who hired him if they looked at him wrong. He's just bad news. Serpentine. In our minds, he's set off against Shane, one particularly good, almost too good to be true, and the other is totally evil."
By this point, too, we have come to know Starrett a little better.
"Shane is more sophisticated," Mr. Allen said. "Shane has traveled more. He's drifted around more, seen more different sides of the world. Starrett is more plain. But they're both very nice men, both brave men. The only difference is that Shane is so amazing with a gun. He's got the gift of God or the artist or something."
The homesteaders, hoping to buck up their confidence, organize a Fourth of July celebration. Starrett notices Shane dancing with Marian, and an odd look crosses his face. After the party, Shane and the Starretts head back to their homestead. It's dark. When they arrive, the Ryker brothers are waiting for them. So is Wilson.

'One of the Best'
"This is a great scene," Mr. Allen said. "Really, from here on until the end of the picture are some of the best scenes I've ever seen in an American movie. And this is one of the best. You have so much going on at the same time, but it's never forced. All these relationships are working at the same time, and Stevens is able to make you feel and understand all of it because he has laid the groundwork so carefully in the earlier scenes. You've got the Rykers, talking reasonable again. You've got the wife worrying about her husband, about their boy. You've got the boy watching this. And then, in the background, without a word, really, you've got Shane and Wilson sizing each other up. And the boy watches this, too. It's directed in the most brilliant way. And when, at the end, Jack Palance backs his horse out of the yard, it's just an amazingly wonderful moment."
The next day, Torrey, the hot-headed homesteader, heads into town. It's too much of a temptation for Wilson. With the Rykers' permission, he picks a fight with Torrey. Standing on the raised wooden sidewalk outside the saloon, looking down at the diminutive Torrey slogging through the mud, Wilson belittles him with a hissing voice, casually puts on his gunfighter's gloves and outdraws Torrey. There is a moment's pause, Torrey standing there with his useless gun in his hand, until Wilson blasts him in cold blood.
"This may be the best shooting confrontation scene in a cowboy movie ever," Mr. Allen said. "First, it's so beautifully filmed, these guys riding into town, the camera going along with them, and then you get the side view of the town with the mountains and the weather. And then Palance, the personification of evil, lures him into this fight. It unfolds so slowly. And then there's the ritual of it, with Palance putting on that glove. It's just his eccentricity, or something, a part of his artistic process, in a sense. It isn't a simple thing, where he just shoots Torrey. There's this whole ritual that goes with it. And it's always so shocking when you get this three- or four-second pause before Palance pulls the trigger, because it's clear that he doesn't have to shoot. He's already beaten him. There's never been a shootout in a cowboy movie to equal it, in terms of evil against innocence."

Violence vs. Violence
Torrey is buried at the graveyard on a hill overlooking the town. Some of these shots are the most stunning in the film: the small cluster of mourners around the open grave, the tiny town in the distance, the towering mountains all around. That night, back at the homestead, the Rykers pass word that they want to meet with Starrett back in town. He knows it's probably a trap, but he also knows he has to go. His chances are slim, but he has come to realize that the Rykers' increasing violence can be defeated only by more violence.
Shane appears. He has his gunfighter's clothes on again, his six-shooters strapped on his waist. He announces that he, not Starrett, is going into town. They quarrel, then fight, tumbling all over the dusty yard until, up against the remains of the stump over which they labored in the opening scenes, Shane knocks Starrett unconscious, says goodbye to Marian, suffers Joey's withering disdain and heads into town.
"Shane doesn't want to get back into gunfighting," Mr. Allen said. "He's been trying the whole movie to put it behind him. But he knows that the only way to put an end to the violence in the valley is for him to do it. That's what makes the film great in my eyes. He knows. He's got to go in there and kill them. And sometimes in life -- it's such an ugly truth -- there is no other way out of a situation but you've got to go in there and kill them. Very few of us are brave enough or have the talent to do it. The world is full of evil, and rationalized evil and evil out of ignorance, and there are times when that evil reaches the level of pure evil, like Jack Palance, and there is no other solution but to go in there and kill them."

He's Not Coming Back
And so the famous climax plays out. Shane makes his long ride into town, Joey running after him. Shane confronts Wilson, pure good versus pure evil, and outdraws him. Then, when the Ryker brothers pull guns on him, Shane shoots them, too, but not before one of them wounds him.
Afterward, Shane gets on his horse and tells Joey that he's not coming back to the ranch. Shane realizes that the era of the gunfighter is ending, but he also knows that he can't be anything else. And so he rides off. "Come back!" Joey calls. But Shane does not come back. The last shot, a mirror of the opening image, has Shane riding over the crest of a hill. Except this time he is heading out of the valley. And it is twilight. And he is hunched over in the saddle. Wounded? Dead? Or simply sorrowful?
"I don't like to think that he's dead," Mr. Allen said. "Just that he's wounded. I hate to think that he dies in the end. I think they probably are pointing to the fact that he's dying because, you know, he's ascending. But I don't like to think that he's dead yet."
And Mr. Allen stood, stretched, turning the lights on one by one.
"Everything pays off," he said. "The relationship between Shane and the kid pays off in spades. But also between Shane and Marian, between the husband and wife. And when Alan Ladd takes control and tells Starrett that he's not letting him go into town, it's like, you know, you always hope in life that there's somebody who will take that kind of control, who will fight your battles. It's really only in the movies that it happens, though. The moment you really want to see, and that you can never see, is the next morning when the people come into town and see that both Ryker brothers and Wilson are dead. You don't get to see that. And you want to. You want to see how they react when they see what Shane has done for them.
"Because the truth is, most people are not comfortable with violence. So they find themselves at the mercy of armies or groups of policemen or vigilantes. You always hope, in that situation, that either a Shane will appear or that you will somehow become like Shane. I use the example of Michael Jordan. He's the guy who knows that the ballgame has to be won in the last six seconds, so he goes out there and quietly wins it. That's what had to happen here. I keep referring to Shane as the artist. You see, that's what he is. Shane is the guy who has brought this gunfighting to the level of art."

HEADLINE: WEEKEND EXCURSION; 
Rochester, Still a Cradle Of Invention

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
"Race a boat! Help a good cause!" shouted a man in yellow boots, waving a pair of footlong toy boats, as we walked down the cobblestone street toward Brown's Race in Rochester, a relic of America's early industrial years that once powered mills grinding wheat into flour for New York City bakeries. For a $5 donation to Big Brothers/Big Sisters, you could watch your toy boat, captained by a rubber amphibian, bob a few dozen feet down the sloping rectangular box that for nearly two centuries has drawn water from the Genesee River at High Falls, the spectacular 90-foot cascade in the heart of downtown Rochester.
 Only a dozen or so of us watched our little boats, nothing like the thousands who gathered along the river gorge here in November 1929 to watch a daredevil named Sam Patch make his second, and fatal, leap over High Falls. Sam Patch's "leap into history," as the folk song gently puts it, parallels the leap we found as weekend tourists in a town that has built on its assets, recycling a rich history of the tools of industrial innovation that helped America prosper into new uses for a new era. 
 For those interested in the economic history of the great, and very uneven, wealth of America, Rochester is a great place to see how our political and social systems create a culture of mass affluence, built on innovation, hard work and investment, and how our ideas about America change with time. I live here on weekends and, with our daughters away at college camp, it was a great time to play tourist at home with my wife, Jennifer Leonard, president of the Rochester Area Community Foundation.
Rochester was the original boomtown. From 1820 to 1830 its population grew sixfold as the power of the Genesee was harnessed to trim logs into lumber and then to grind into flour the wheat grown in the vast flat fields that had been primeval forests. When the Erie Canal reached town in 1823, everything fell into prosperous place.
For more than a century Rochester was to industrial America what Silicon Valley is to the digital age. Western Union made telegrams cheap and reliable. George Eastman's Brownie camera let anyone take photographs. The signals that let trains run on time without crashing head on came from here.
So did Xerox's copiers. As well as new ways to move earth and improve underwater cement.
Today Rochester and surrounding Monroe County remain a center of invention (second, after Silicon Valley, in patents per capita), biotechnology (third per capita in graduate bioscience degrees) and exports (first per capita). The golden handshakes from a decade of downsizing at Kodak, Xerox and Bausch & Lomb have financed new enterprises that use fiber optics and organic molecules to create the digital and biotechnology products of the future.

From Mill to Museum
We began our weekend, as Rochester began its past, on the banks of the Genesee at the Centers at High Falls, a long-ago grain mill that today is a multistory family entertainment center with history museum, art gallery, restaurants and a jazz club. Through the glass floor of the history museum the original flood-control gates of the mill race can be viewed. An interactive computer exhibit models the making of the Genesee River gorge, beginning 10,000 years ago; the falls formed when the river, having failed to break through hard limestone, abruptly burrowed deep into layers of softer shale. The scions of Rochester history tell their stories on demand in a clever, compact exhibit.
Throughout the Centers, tiny horses decorated by schoolchildren stand atop exhibit cases, on window ledges and stair landings. They are part of the "Horses on Parade" public art sculptures of high-stepping and rearing ponies placed around Rochester with the sponsorship of the High Falls Brewing Company, which is also reinventing itself under new ownership for a new era of competition. The brewery dominates the other side of the river at High Falls, connected by a footbridge called Pont de Rennes, named for Rochester's sister city in France.
The waterways that drove the grist mills and moved the grain now move kayaks, crew teams, fishing dories and tour boats; "lake liners" sleeping 84 come in from the St. Lawrence Seaway by way of the locks of the Erie Canal and tie up at Corn Hill Landing, just south of the falls. At the far end of the city, where the north-flowing Genesee River empties into Lake Ontario after rushing over three sets of falls, a fast ferry to Toronto is to start service next year.

Lasers and Fireworks
After the public opening of a painting, sculpture and fiber art show in the High Falls Gallery, we visited the Empire Brewing Company, a microbrewery in a rehabilitated button factory with sleek Art Deco touches in its wood-paneled interior. It was hard to say which was better: the cheeky beers, which included a German wheat beer that tasted like iced tea, lemonade and pilsner, or the lobster egg rolls made with a soft, yeasty wrap. We knew it was time to get going when the crowds from Frontier Field, the new baseball park that is even more intimate than its architectural parent, Camden Yards, started passing our table on the way to the Pont de Rennes. The laser light show was fast approaching.
Now in its eighth year, the laser light show in the High Falls gorge has fine-tuned its virtuoso son-et-lumiere displays to please baby boomers, Generation X'ers and the latest generation, which some are calling "echo tots." A once-interminable history of the gorge from Ice Age to Space Age has shrunk to a charming few minutes of vignettes, followed by riveting lights and fireworks set to song, from the Beach Boys to James Brown. This may have been the first time in our lives that fireworks exploded at our eye level -- a thrill worth going to the Pont de Rennes early enough to get one of the coveted first-row spots at the rail.
We drifted away with the mellow crowds, past a life-size Horse on Parade called "All Keyed Up," in which computer keys had been recycled as body armor and colorful cable wires became mane and tail.
Our destination was the Inn on Broadway, an elegant 23-room bed-and-breakfast built in the former University Club of Rochester and within walking distance of theaters, restaurants and museums.
We arrived as crowds of young people drifted away from the monthly East End Festival, with music acts on street stages, clubs open late and a vibrant gaiety beyond the energy of us midlifers; it was (we hate to admit it) more fun to imagine than to partake in. (In winter, the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra or Eastman School of Music recitals would be the local music of choice, a block away at the 3,000-seat Eastman Theater with original Maxfield Parrish murals.)

A Featherbed Feeling
Our room's evocative decor featured old travel gear, a grand armoire, even century-old Harvard Club of New York registers (in keeping with the open chess set and World War II history by the breakfast coffee service on our floor). The featherbed feel of the bed and the three-jet shower completed the luxurious "just for us" getaway feel, augmented by the jazz radio that played softly from a modern but welcome combination CD player and alarm clock.
Later we found that our charming Canadian hosts were also handy with a griddle, and their lemon blueberry pancakes were a great start to the next day. Cohabiting with the catering company Gatherings, the inn continues the University Club's tradition of handling weddings and banquets in the landmark living room, the library, the College Room and the main ballroom. The last of these features two magnificent crystal chandeliers as well as murals of the Erie Canal, High Falls, Kodak and the University of Rochester -- home of an exciting new biotechnology research thrust, which has the whole city talking.

Kitsch of Every Era
In the morning we strolled two blocks from our hotel to the Strong Museum, named for an eccentric and single-minded benefactor, Margaret Woodbury Strong, whose family invested early in Kodak stock but could never get her to appreciate the benefits of regular bathing. Her fortune allowed her to build the largest doll and toy collection in the world, which she left to the museum, along with an endowment.
You can visit Mrs. Strong's collection, and many scholars do, on the second floor, where row upon row of glass cases display porcelain, wood, fabric and animated dolls, as well as porcelain tea sets and even Burma Shave signs. There are also Kewpie dolls and Ninja Turtles, giving a sense of the continuum of time as well as a reminder that kitsch is part of every era. There are also dozens of dollhouses. Our favorite featured a wood-paneled dining room with sterling silver chandelier and real brass fire implements.
The Strong Museum, which has plans to become one of the largest children's museums in the country, has already transformed itself from a dull warren of glass display cases into a lively, family-oriented interactive educational center. It has the first permanent "Sesame Street" exhibition in a museum and a child-size model of Rochester's renowned Wegmans supermarkets, which are often the first stop for visitors. On any weekday morning, preschoolers crowd the exhibits and the historic diner and an indoor carousel.
Our favorite exhibit takes a jaundiced look at the role of toys in fighting the cold war. "When Barbie Dated G.I. Joe" brings into sharp focus how toys served political purposes. A video loop of black-and-white commercials for toy six-shooters, a girl's board game called "Mystery Date" and other products offer reminders of how gender stereotyping was the norm in the days before a gleam in Gloria Steinem's eye became Ms. magazine. And how times change. Twice we heard children, reading from the display cards, ask their parents what the U.S.S.R. was.

The Eastman Legacy
A half-hour's walk away was George Eastman House, which combines the best of a mansion cum photographic museum. Aficionados worldwide also know that its archives house the original of many 35-millimeter movies and a treasure of historic photographic prints and negatives. We spent the afternoon at an Ansel Adams show, which examined how he took the images of photographers who had come along years or decades before and, with Eastman's improved technology, made even more compelling images. For many visitors it provides the first inkling that many other photographers captured Yosemite's Half Dome before Adams. The breadth and depth and longevity of Adams's photography stand out clearly in this exhibition, illuminated by a fine feel for his artistic imagination and technical genius, which results in a Platonic image of the natural world.
Eastman, who built the Eastman Theater and endowed the Eastman School of Music, also built his house for music. He held regular musicales in his enormous front living room. But the astounding history is that of the sunlit conservatory, built with a pipe organ in the wall. The organ music played as he came down to breakfast each morning (a breakfast setting is still seen by visitors), but alas, soon after moving into his new house, he declared its acoustics inadequate. To ensure a better sound, he had his house sliced in two and widened by 10 feet, a job that cost more than building the original mansion. 
The conservatory also reminds visitors of changing views of propriety. It is dominated by a cast made from the head of a giant elephant, which Eastman shot in the days when shooting on safari did not refer to a Kodak moment.

Cannons Out, Artworks In
After a stroll back past the East Avenue mansion and a break at Spot Coffee, a delightfully eclectic coffeehouse inside a 1930's Art Deco car showroom a block from the Inn on Broadway, we decided to visit another example of how an old industrial enterprise has found new life.
We drove to what had been a factory that turned out cannons in World War II and is now home to the Elizabeth Collection and its companion M.E.T.A.L. Arts, a cornucopia of modern art hung in an occasionally baffling richness of styles and mediums. A collector for more than 30 years, Louis Perticone rented the place to display his objets d'art. His father, William, an artist now in his 80's, painted major murals as part of the meandering vistas of this massive project. In a typical setting, a Frederic Remington bronze sits next to a miniature "Last Supper" tapestry table runner, not far from a Fantasy Art chair of giant lips beckoning the weary.
The M.E.T.A.L. museum (the letters stand for Museum at the Elizabeth Collection for Twentieth-Century American Laborers) offers a nonprofit and more thematic side to the collection (although almost everything is for sale). Modern versions of monumental worker murals serve as backdrops for six-foot wooden models of staplers, soda fountains and 1920's telephones. A recent Parisian street scene features several of the 25 artists' studios that are integral parts of the site; a Japanese tearoom (which can be rented for special dinners, as can many of the parts of the gallery and museum) features Oriental art treasures and books; a "Living With Art" exhibit displays art in a home setting to show its integration into decor.
We could have eaten nearby at the former propeller factory turned lively Italian restaurant and patio bar called Pomodoro, but we chose to return to our hotel neighborhood and walk three blocks to a former car detail shop turned French bistro. 2Vine (named for the detail shop's address on an alley that is now its parking lot) has become so popular that our hosts at the inn suggested we order one course at a time to ensure a leisurely dinner. We did, and we enjoyed fabulous food right down to the chocolate-wrapped creme brulee. By that time it was dark and we could happily wander back, sated, to our hotel. We ferreted our way through a wedding party and a crowd of fans of the Little Theater, a nonprofit art film house next door to the restaurant, and once more settled cozily into our home away from home.

Canoeing on the Erie Canal
On Sunday morning we went to canoe on the Erie Canal in Pittsford, a 1789 village that has preserved much of its charm and many of its vintage buildings. We rented a canoe at State Street and put into the water off a floating dock that put the first scent of fear into our landlubber souls. Strong canoeing skills would have been helpful because of pleasure boat traffic, which can leave large wakes that rock canoes. But the overhanging trees and smooth waters were a pleasant excuse for exercise. More athletic folks can rent kayaks at the same place, and many residents as well as visitors use the canal path for bicycling; there are convenient rentals right at dockside.
We took lunch at Aladdin's, where you can enjoy octopus salad and hummus on either of two small decks while watching children feed the mallards in the canal and watch power boats glide past.
We left as a gentleman angler on the promenade parried and tugged with something on the end of his line. Each movement drew another set of eyes as people rested their bikes, licked their cones and murmured "Ah-h-h!" as the fish bent the fisherman's slender rod into an arc, which, like the gathering crowd, slowly tightened. The big fish broke the surface for a moment, to gasps from the crowd, before plunging into the murky water, tugging at the taut line until it went limp, and the fish, like the crowd on this lazy Sunday afternoon, moved on.

Shares Rise Warily on Upbeat Statements From Intel

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday after Intel signaled that the beleaguered personal computer industry might turn the corner, but memories of this year's false rallies kept investors cautious.
 "A lot of money has been burnt up, and it is going to take time for investors to heal, to resave and redeploy," said Tom Sparico, managing director of equities at the broker-dealer Bengal Partners. "It is going to take time for us to work our way back to the confidence levels that business investment will grow at a fast enough pace to add to earnings growth of something more than single digits." 
 Upbeat comments from Intel ignited a modest early-morning rally, but stocks started to weaken at mid-session. It was the third consecutive day an early rally fizzled. Investors remain skittish after a dismal second-quarter reporting season offered few hints that a profit recovery was in sight. 
"I keep asking, 'Is this for real? Is there any chance six months from now we are going to see a better economy?' People I know say this is a phony rally and don't be sucked in," said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. 
"I have been negative for a while. I have been trying my best to switch my position and get a little more positive, but it sure is tough," he added. "I keep wondering where is the earnings turnaround going to come from?"
The Nasdaq composite index rose 19 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 2,087.38, after climbing more than 1.6 percent early in the session and then dipping into negative territory.
The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average gained 41.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,551.18. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended up 4.82 points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,220.75.
Investors took heart in government data showing claims for unemployment benefits dropped for the third consecutive week last week. But another report kept optimism in check by suggesting the manufacturing sector is still struggling to climb out of a painful recession. Wall Street is hoping today's employment numbers for July will offer a better read on the economy.
Craig R. Barrett, president and chief executive of Intel, said the personal computer industry had bottomed out and demand for personal computers should rebound in the second half of the year. But he noted that a full-blown rebound depended on a global economic recovery.
Intel, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow average, rose $1.36, to $32.11. The company, the world's largest maker of chips for personal computers, was the most active Nasdaq issue.
The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index advanced 3.15 percent, reflecting gains in other computer chip makers. The index continued its trek above its 200-day average, which it first broke above on Wednesday after a bullish call from Merrill Lynch on chip makers.
Dell Computer climbed $1.25, to $28.43, while I.B.M. advanced $1.74, to $108.80.
Microsoft, a Dow component and Nasdaq heavyweight, gained 98 cents, to $67.45. A federal appeals court rejected the company's request to re-examine part of its ruling in the landmark antitrust case against the company and also declined to speed the case's passage back to a lower court, a move sought by the federal government.

Treasury Prices Drop
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices fell yesterday after a decline in jobless claims suggested that the economy might rebound without further Federal Reserve interest rate reductions after this month.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 21/32, to a price of 98 27/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.16 percent from 5.07 percent on Wednesday. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 25/32, to 97 2/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.58 percent from 5.52 percent on Wednesday.

356 Units Under New City Bond Plan

BYLINE:  By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
A 356-apartment rental complex at Seventh Avenue and 26th Street, part of a spurt of residential building in Chelsea, is the first to be financed under a city-sponsored taxable bond program that offers developers quicker, if somewhat more expensive, access to financing.
 In return, the developers make some of the apartments available to people whose incomes, though moderate, are too high to qualify for traditional city housing programs. 
 The 340,000-square-foot complex, known as Chelsea Centro, consists of two adjoining properties: 200 West 26th Street, which has 17 stories and 231 apartments, and 220 West 26th, which has 11 stories and 125 apartments.
Eighty percent of the apartments will be rented at market rates, while the remaining 71 apartments have been set aside for low- and moderate-income households that earn up to 80 percent of the median income in the New York City area. The usual cap on income to qualify for such apartments under what are called 80/20 programs is half of the area's median income.

Singleton, a senior vice president at the Rockrose Development Corporation, said that his company was prompted to build Chelsea Centro because of the success of its nearby Chelsea Mercantile luxury condominium at Seventh Avenue and 24th Street. Since that building began selling apartments in May 1999 -- its last apartment was sold about three weeks ago -- five new rental buildings, with a total of 1,500 apartments, have sprouted in the area north of West 23rd Street, said Charles Singer, the director of market research at Rockrose.
To develop Chelsea Centro, Rockrose bought a parking lot in June 1999 that bordered both West 25th and West 26th Streets and that used to house flea markets. The company took advantage of a new taxable bond program that was rolled out by the New York City Housing Development Corporation in February 2000.
The program gives developers relatively fast access to financing if they agree to devote a fifth of their buildings to apartments for those families that because of income caps do not qualify for more traditional housing programs. At Chelsea Centro, that translates into income of no more than $33,100 for a one-person household up to $47,250 for a family of four.
Most such "affordable housing" programs in New York City are financed through the sale of city-backed tax-exempt bonds, which currently pay about 1.5 percentage points less in interest than their taxable cousins might. But because sales of the bonds are limited during any particular year and also because developers have no control over when they will actually get the proceeds, last year the Housing Development Corporation introduced a more flexible financing alternative, said to be the first of its kind in the United States.
"With interest rates so low in general, these bonds are still attractive" compared with tax-exempt offerings, said Russell A. Harding, the president of the Housing Development Corporation.
The new city-backed bonds provided Chelsea Centro with more than $74 million in financing. But according to Mr. Singleton, they also helped his company bring the development to market about a year sooner than it might have otherwise.
For market-rate apartments at Chelsea Centro, which is now about 90 percent leased, Rockrose is asking $2,125 monthly for a 408-square-foot studio to $5,045 for a 1,164-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment.
The 20 percent of the apartments reserved for people with moderate incomes have all been rented to tenants who were selected, after first qualifying for the apartments, on a first-come-first-served basis. The apartments have monthly rentals of $747 for a studio to $961 for a two-bedroom unit.
The future of the 45,000 square feet of retail space at Chelsea Centro is uncertain, mostly because the largest prospective tenant, Lechter's, the housewares retailer, filed for bankruptcy protection before it could move into its 39,000-square-foot space.
If all goes according to plan, more developers may be coming to Chelsea soon. Mr. Harding said that the Housing Development Corporation was working with three other developers who were interested in using the taxable bonds to develop properties in both Chelsea and Clinton. "We think the bonds have been highly successful," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Public service ads had a record year in 2000, and the ad council has high hopes about 2001.

BYLINE:  By Allison Fass 

 BODY:
IN 2000, the strongest year ever for advertising spending, the time and space donated to public service campaigns created by the Advertising Council also reached a record.
 The council received about $1.55 billion in donated media time and space, a 38 percent increase from the $1.12 billion in 1999. And with advertisers spending less in a sluggish economy, the council hopes to do better this year. 
 "We hope to grow it, of course, and I think there is plenty of room to grow" even if overall public service advertising does not increase, said Peggy Conlon, president and chief executive at the 59-year-old council in New York, which produces campaigns to educate viewers about issues like crime, drunken driving and seat-belt use. 
"It's definitely an opportunity for us to get our P.S.A.'s out there," Ms. Conlon added, and the slowing economy "certainly has been a factor in the increase that we've seen in media in the first quarter." 
Donated media time and space increased 23 percent in the first quarter, to $323.9 million from $262.9 million in the quarter a year earlier. Radio, the Internet and television were the top three donors in the first quarter, as they were in 2000.
Donations by radio in the first quarter rose 34 percent, to $159 million from $119 million; Internet donations were up about 13 percent, to $77.1 million from $68.5 million. Donated television advertising fell about 3 percent, to $61.6 million from $63.2 million.
"We're not looking for a huge increase in television inventory going to P.S.A.'s," Ms. Conlon said. "We know that they have to generate revenue and that may actually work against us because if they're getting a lower rate, they have to sell more ads in order to meet their revenue projections."
The donated time and space last year had the largest percentage increase since 1994, and 2000 was the third consecutive year that the value exceeded $1 billion. It was fueled by the sharp growth on the Internet and by continued support from radio.
And it was not just because of altruism. Ms. Conlon attributed the council's success in 2000 to three things: compelling campaign topics, emphasis on the importance of creative work and an increase in media outreach.
Radio was also the largest donor in 2000, providing $707 million of time, an 18 percent increase from $597.7 million in 1999. After radio was the Internet, whose donations jumped 499 percent, to $391.6 million from $65.4 million. Television was again third, up 0.5 percent, to $316 million from $314.6 million.
"I don't have any empirical evidence that the whole category of public service advertising grew," Ms. Conlon said. "We just look at what our part is in it, and I think what we experienced was probably a better share of market of that piece of the pie that is public service advertising."
She acknowledged that the Internet, the medium that had the largest increase, was also one that attracted cynicism because of skepticism about the effectiveness of banner advertising. But, she said, the council had found that the largest source of traffic to sites operated by Environmental Defense in New York was from Internet users clicking on donated banner ads.
Of the council's 40 or so campaigns, the two that earned the most donated support in 2000 did so because of the Internet. They were the campaign for Environmental Defense, at $169.5 million for the year, followed by one for the National 4-H Council in Chevy Chase, Md., with $117.3 million. 
The campaign for the National Crime Prevention Council in Washington, which traditionally attracts the most in donated time and space, was third with $75.4 million. The council said that if the Internet was excluded, the crime prevention campaign would be No. 1, and it attributed the change to preferences among people who make decisions about online advertising.
The council said it had been working to make sure its campaigns were being brought to the attention of the public service directors who decide whether to donate time and space, and it had been doing so by acknowledging the contributions of the media; educating agencies, advertisers and outlets; and attending media conferences, among other things.
The council is also trying to work more closely with regional markets and is providing more information about local associations and groups that are a part of a campaign. For example, the council is offering TV spots that can be "tagged" by local networks featuring their anchors, weather forecasters or sports figures.
To increase awareness and make the content more relevant, the council has started partnerships with organizations like the Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies in McLean, Va. (about six campaigns now have a separate Spanish-language component); Mediascope in Studio City, Calif., which promotes media responsibility; and Promax in Los Angeles, an organization for promotion and marketing executives.
"We're also going to put together a media advisory committee this year that will help us look at the issues that come before us," said Ira B. Tumpowsky, executive vice president for media at the council, "and maybe there's somebody out there that has a creative idea that we haven't tapped yet that we can look at and see how it works in the marketplace."

HEADLINE: A Cloudy Future for Policing 

BYLINE:  By William J. Bratton; William J. Bratton, a senior consultant to Kroll Associates, served as police commissioner in Boston and New York.

 BODY:
In Washington next week, many of America's most senior and experienced police leaders will gather at a conference sponsored by the Justice Department to discuss the current state of American policing. They will have a lot to talk about.
 Despite the historic crime reductions in the 1990's, for which police can justifiably claim much of the credit, American policing has become a deeply conflicted profession. Instead of being praised for the continuing declines in crime, police are increasingly criticized on a number of issues and for a wide variety of failings. As Gilbert and Sullivan put it more than 100 years ago: "A policeman's lot is not a happy one." 
 From Los Angeles to New York City, from Cincinnati to Miami, many of the nation's police forces face intense scrutiny and criticism for corruption, racial profiling, racial insensitivity, brutality, unresponsiveness to community concerns and professional incompetence.
This image of a troubled profession is a major contributor to the growing recruitment crisis for American police departments, which are having difficulty attracting qualified recruits, particularly from inner city neighborhoods and minority communities.
As reported in The New York Times earlier this week, the problem has spread to the top ranks of the profession. John Diaz, an assistant police chief in Seattle who does not plan to seek a top chief's job, said, "The politics of being police chief have become so insane no one wants the job." He may not be alone in that sentiment.
The causes of the current recruitment crisis, both at the entry level and at the top of the profession, are fairly clear. Starting pay of officers is relatively low in the current full-employment economy, and younger people don't see beyond the starting pay to weigh the advantages of a job with generous medical and retirement benefits. Even salaries for experienced officers remain low in cities like New York, where these officers can seek other opportunities. Policing has also become less a family tradition than it was a generation ago. And there is little appreciation among young people of the complexity and variety police work can offer or of the skills developed in policing that can be transferred to other arenas. The perception that policing offers limited opportunities, coupled with steady reports about police abuses -- which represent a very small percentage of police actions -- is more than enough to discourage a lot of people from even considering becoming police officers. It will require leadership and significant changes in police policy to reverse these perceptions.
For example, by providing the public detailed information about arrests and stop-and-frisk activities (as the New York City police department has recently agreed to do), departments can build greater trust in the community and therefore improve the climate for recruitment. 
We don't have all the answers about what must be done. What is clear, however, is what must not be done. We cannot, under any circumstances, reverse efforts to improve the qualifications, educational standards, diversity, training and accountability of officers or chiefs. Lowering standards to meet a short-term crisis would be counterproductive. Departments that go on hiring binges soon face even bigger problems when recruits unsuited to police work begin to work on city streets.
In 1994, when I was the New York City police commissioner and we were raising hiring standards for police officers, we did a study of officers who had been arrested as a direct result of the Mollen Commission investigation into police corruption and brutality. We found that not one of the officers who had been involved in that scandal would have been hired had our new standards been in place.
If we are going to sustain police successes against crime and expand efforts to work closely with communities, police departments must be able to attract the best from all segments of the population. We need individuals who see policing as a calling, not just as a job; who see the community as a partner, not as the problem; and who can be trusted to enforce the law without violating it themselves. Law enforcement needs to look at the recruitment crisis as a challenge -- like the challenge of reducing crime. Police departments systematically improved their crime-fighting techniques in the 1990's. I believe that with the right leadership and incentives, they can have the same type of success in recruitment.

HEADLINE: Liability Insurers Pushing Companies to Share Risks 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Americans have had to get used to making bigger co-payments when they go to the doctor, as a result of changes in health insurers' policies. Now, a wave of shareholder lawsuits is prompting liability insurers to impose larger co-payments on corporate clients, too.
 The focus is on policies written to protect corporate executives and board members against suits charging that they did not act in the interest of shareholders -- by, for example, hiding losses or turning a blind eye to overstated revenue. 
 For the last five years or so, these insurance policies have paid 100 percent of a settlement or an award by a court after the company paid a deductible. But now, some companies will have to share more of the burden -- at least 15 percent and probably closer to 25 percent of any amount paid, insurers say. 
By forcing corporate clients to share more of the cost, analysts say, these new policies are intended by the insurers to discourage settlements. The shift is coming as such claims mount -- and, some insurers say, as shareholders are increasingly well armed with earnings restatements that support accusations of wrongdoing.
It could thus mean more litigation of securities claims, bigger legal bills and greater uncertainty about the outcome of lawsuits. 
The problem with current policies, said John Keogh, president of National Union Fire Insurance of Pittsburgh, is that they encourage companies to treat coverage as free settlement money. Companies may agree to pay the full amount of coverage for relatively weak claims, he said, because they have no incentive to reduce settlements. 
Mr. Keogh, whose company is a subsidiary of the American International Group, one of the largest underwriters of corporate liability insurance, added, "It's dysfunctional to have a product where all the responsibility is on the insurer financially, and none of it on the insured."
Liability insurance for directors and executives could start around $200,000 a year for $25 million of coverage, he said, and be affected by how likely it was that the company would face strong lawsuits. 
Businesses, of course, are not eager to share in the cost of settling securities claims against them, and argue that part of the reason to buy insurance in the first place is to protect them from having to pay. 
But Randy Thurman, director of risk management at Gaylord Entertainment, based in Nashville, and a vice president of the Risk and Insurance Management Society, saw matters as more uncertain. "If the co-insurance percentage that they were interested in negotiating was 10 percent," he said, "I wouldn't see a serious problem with that. If it were 25 percent, or a third, or a half, that would worry me a great deal."
Such a change would prompt his company to seek another insurer, Mr. Thurman said, adding that its current liability insurer had not announced changes to its policy.
Not all insurers have said so far that they will adopt a co-insurance system, and some may well hold out in an effort to frustrate this developing trend. But some of the largest, like A.I.G. and Chubb, which together account for more than a third of the market for corporate directors' and officers' insurance, have said that they are making the change. More clients may begin to see the changes as their policies come up for renewal, usually once a year. 
Behind the insurers' plan is concern about a sharp recent increase in the number and size of lawsuits filed against executives and board members. So far this year, 223 securities class-action suits have been filed in federal courts, compared with 211 in all of 2000, according to the Securities Class Action Clearinghouse at Stanford University Law School.
The size of settlements has also increased, rising to $14 million last year -- excluding a billion-dollar settlement by Cendant -- from $12.9 million in 1999, according to National Economic Research Associates, a consulting firm. Some prominent securities settlements recently include one by Procter & Gamble for $49 million in June, by Rite Aid for $200 million last November, and by 3Com for $259 million, also in November.
Lawyers for corporate directors and executives said that larger claims and larger settlements might be inevitable consequences of generally rising stock prices in recent years. The higher a stock's price, the more money investors may lose if the market value of the stock plummets.
But the claims that shareholders are filing against companies may also seem stronger, said Tony S. Galban, vice president and underwriting manager of directors' and officers' coverage at Chubb. 
"There are more claims with teeth," he said, because the kinds of mistakes that some companies have made are highly visible. "There's not a lot of defense when you have to restate your financials. What are you going to argue: 'We didn't blow it?' "
A greater risk to insurers could also be dealt with through higher premiums rather than co-insurance, said Robert Rabin, a professor at Stanford Law School. "Insurance itself can have a deterrent effect," he said, "if the insured recognizes that claims against it will result in higher premiums," adding that might discourage too-easy settlements.
The changes may also lead, lawyers say, to two tiers of insurance for directors and corporate executives: one type for those paying smaller premiums but sharing more risk, and the other for those paying more for full coverage.
The adoption of co-insurance is in some ways a return to a system in the early 1990's of allocating the burden of paying claims, said Michael D. Torpey, a partner in the law firm of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison in San Francisco. Then, insurers sold policies covering only directors and officers, and after a claim was settled or a judgment issued by a court, the insurer and the company would dicker over how to divide the payment obligations.
"There was always a fight over allocation," Mr. Torpey said. But in the wake of court decisions hostile to insurers, and as the market for directors' and officers' coverage softened, insurance carriers began to offer so-called entity policies that would cover claims against directors, officers and the company itself.
"One of the side effects was that when you have entity coverage, after you get past the deductible, it's all on the carrier," he said. "Carriers didn't like that."

HEADLINE: June Factory Orders Fell Farther Than Expected 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
Factory orders fell 2.4 percent in June, a steeper drop than expected, led by declines in demand for computers and transportation equipment, a government report showed today.
 The decline in orders came after a 2.2 percent increase in May, the Commerce Department said. A 4 percent increase in orders for semiconductors, after a 34.6 percent surge in May, was not enough to outweigh the declines in computers and transportation equipment. Analysts expected an overall drop of 1.3 percent. 
 A separate report showed that the number of workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits declined last week to the lowest level in almost five and a half months, a sign that the worst of the job reductions may be over.
Initial jobless claims fell 23,000, to 346,000, in the week that ended Saturday, the Labor Department said. The drop, to the lowest level since Feb. 17, may reflect the return of furloughed workers after temporary shutdowns at auto plants.
Claims have fallen in each of the last three weeks, the longest string of declines since July 1998.
"There is a glimmer of hope that companies aren't firing workers as aggressively," said Richard Yamarone, the chief economist at the Argus Research Corporation in New York. Even so, "until the economy begins to pick up, companies will be less likely to add workers," he said.
A Labor Department report due out Friday is expected to show that the unemployment rate rose to 4.7 percent in July from 4.5 percent in June, analysts said. That would be the highest jobless rate since March 1998.
"It is more likely that labor markets are groping for a bottom than actually improving," said Steven Wood, the chief economist at FinancialOxygen in Walnut Creek, Calif.
This year, weekly jobless claims have averaged 382,800, up from the weekly average of 302,800 last year and the most since 407,800 in 1992. The government's statistics are based on requests for financial assistance administered by state and territorial employment service agencies. The number of people collecting unemployment benefits fell to 3.002 million during the week ended July 21 from 3.082 million in the previous week.
Companies are cutting costs to bolster profits as business slows with a sluggish economy. The bulk of recent job losses have been in manufacturing, especially at makers of business equipment. The economy grew in the second quarter at the slowest rate in eight years as business investment slumped and consumer spending cooled.

HEADLINE: The Mayoral Race and the Poor 

 BODY:
The signs are multiplying. New York's shelter system is reeling from the rise in homeless families. Food pantries are reporting a spike in the number of elderly people and children standing in line for their next meal. 
 Everyone hopes that the next mayor New York City elects will be confronted with problems such as which tax to cut or how to best improve the parks. But an economic downturn raises the possibility that his first big challenge will be a surge in the number of dislocated poor people who will turn to the city for food and shelter. 
 Right now, applications for shelter are running 30 percent higher than last year. The homeless population could grow even greater when the weather turns cold this coming winter. Food pantries and soup kitchens around the city serve 500,000 people a month -- and requests for emergency food are said to have risen dramatically. At the end of the year nearly 39,000 families, or roughly 75,000 people, reach the five-year lifetime limit on federal welfare aid and are removed from the rolls. The state will provide more restrictive assistance under a new and still evolving program. But families will have to reapply in order to get the state aid, a procedure that always leads to confusion, with people falling through the cracks and applicants who are actually qualified for aid being rejected.
The candidates for mayor have not, in general, attempted to duck the issue of what they would do about the homeless and hungry. But for the most part their campaigns address people who are concerned about other things, like neighborhood services and how to consolidate the Giuliani administration's crime-fighting successes.
The growing number of distressed poor families has to become one of the main points of discussion in this campaign. Voters who do not ask about it now may find themselves demanding answers later, especially if desperate New Yorkers begin to spill out of the shelters and back onto the sidewalks and streets.

HEADLINE: AOL Time Warner Reverses Itself on Cable Shift After Pressure by NBC 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
After deciding to move the financial news network CNBC to a less desirable, higher-numbered cable channel in New York City, AOL Time Warner reversed itself yesterday afternoon under pressure from NBC.
 Time Warner Cable of New York City, a division of AOL Time Warner, sent a letter to its 1.1 million customers in the city last week saying that it would move CNBC to Channel 64 from Channel 15 on Sept. 5. That raised antitrust concerns because the network would have been further back in the rotation than its chief rival, CNNfn, on Channel 27, which is owned by AOL Time Warner. 
 On Channel 64, CNBC would have been behind nearly every major cable network, nestled between Home and Garden Television and the Spice Channel, which shows pay-per-view sex movies. Officials at CNBC's parent company, NBC, and others said that such a move would be a realization of the fears they had when AOL's acquisition of Time Warner was approved earlier this year. 
Many critics of the merger said that the resulting conglomerate, AOL Time Warner, would have an unfair advantage by having its own television networks while controlling cable and Internet pipelines into millions of customers' homes.
CNBC would have been replaced on Channel 15 by Bravo, a film and live entertainment network that had paid Time Warner Cable to get better placement on its lineup. But NBC has a 20 percent financial interest in Bravo, and officials there said yesterday that they were unaware that they would be replacing CNBC, the dominant financial news network.
Throughout the day, NBC executives negotiated with Bravo officials to get them to agree to flip the two channels back. NBC said those talks were an attempt to avert filing a costly and difficult antitrust claim against AOL Time Warner.
A little before 5 p.m., the three sides reached an agreement to keep Bravo and CNBC where they were. "They brought that proposal to us," said Barry Rosenblum, the president of Time Warner Cable, "and we went ahead and agreed with them." 
Last year, before its acquisition by AOL, Time Warner came under criticism for a decision to black out ABC stations in several cities during a dispute with the network's parent, the Walt Disney Company, over payments for carrying ABC stations. Time Warner, which eventually came under enough public pressure to reverse its decision, was viewed as using the reach of its cable system to play hardball with Disney.
Yesterday, Corey Shields, an NBC spokesman, said officials were happy that this did not become similarly contentious. It was unclear whether Bravo got any concessions from NBC for giving up what would have been a prime spot.
If Bravo and NBC had not been able to come up with a deal, or if AOL Time Warner had not cooperated, the dispute could have led to what antitrust experts called the first legitimate challenge to a cable company's channel placement.
There are no provisions in federal antitrust law that regulate where cable companies place many channels, including networks like CNBC. But antitrust experts said that this situation could rise to the level of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act because AOL could have been construed as using its monopoly position as a cable company to benefit CNNfn at the expense of CNBC.
"Typically, you don't see a company like NBC having to go so far as filing a lawsuit to have their concerns addressed," said Christopher M. Mason, an antitrust and securities partner at Nixon Peabody, a Manhattan law firm. "NBC itself is a large and economically powerful company that has other broadcasting that Time Warner carries, and I was sure they would get Time Warner to listen to them."

Agency Layoffs And a Closing

BYLINE:  By Allison Fass 

 BODY:
Two agencies have announced lay-offs, while another is closing.
 Arnold Worldwide in Boston, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas Advertising, is laying off about 30 employees, or about 2.7 percent of its 1,100 employees in the United States, at offices in McLean, Va., San Francisco and St. Louis and at regional field offices. 
 Rebecca Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Arnold, said the layoffs were in response to the slowing economy. "I think everyone's tightening up all over the place," she said.
Last month, Arnold closed its design unit, Cipriani Kremer Design in Boston. Ms. Sullivan said the agency still planned to absorb most of the 18 employees from Cipriani. In January, the office in San Francisco, Arnold Ingalls Moranville, laid off about 12 of its 75 employees.
The New York office of TBWA/ Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, is laying off 8 from its staff of 216.
"We're just realigning and restructuring staff to accommodate the current production and service needs of our clients," said Jeremy Miller, a spokesman for TBWA/ Chiat/Day, confirming a report in the online edition of Adweek.
In May, the TBWA/Chiat/Day New York office laid off 17 of its 233 employees. The agency has laid off about 10.7 percent of its staff. 
Also, Robaire & Hogshead, a small agency in Venice, Calif., is being closed after three and a half years for what was described by its executives, Sally Hogshead and Jean Robaire, as philosophical differences and not economic conditions.
"While Sally wants very much to grow an ad agency in a traditional sense, I'm more focused on continuing to really focus on the creative end of things," said Mr. Robaire, co-creative director.
Robaire & Hogshead has eight employees.
The wants of Ms. Hogshead, 31, co-creative director, include managerial as well as creative duties in her next post. Mr. Robaire, 43, plans to continue creative work for projects in conjunction with agencies.

HEADLINE: Defiant Legislators Proceed on Budget Spurned by Pataki 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
The State Legislature passed a stripped-down budget early this morning, four months overdue, defying Gov. George E. Pataki only hours after he declared that the spending plan was unconstitutional and would cause many government programs to run out of money.
 The 11th-hour clash between the governor, who has blamed the Assembly Democrats for the budget impasse, and Democratic and Republican leaders staying past midnight to vote on the lean spending plan tossed the state's fiscal house into confusion. As the last votes were cast just before 1 a.m., it was unclear whether the governor would turn around later today and challenge the budget plan in court. 
 Last week, the Democrats who control the Assembly and the Republican-led Senate put aside partisan differences and agreed to pass an austere budget intended to make it hard for Mr. Pataki to govern. Their aim is to force the governor into three-way negotiations over a supplemental budget, in which they hope to add some initiatives that the governor is resisting. 
For months, the governor and Assembly Democrats have been unable to reach agreement on revenue estimates because of a disagreement about the economy's future. Mr. Pataki has accused the Democrats of proposing irresponsible spending increases, while the Democrats have refused to pass a budget without the governor's participation. Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, has balked at passing a budget with the Senate unless the governor agrees not to resort to widespread vetoes, as he did in 1998.
Thursday began almost uneventfully, with lawmakers gathering in the Capitol as they faced yet another deadline: at midnight the government would lose its authority to spend money without a budget or an extension. They also faced the possible embarrassment of setting a new record for late budgets if their stalemate had lasted until Sunday. New York has not passed a budget on time in 17 years.
Like most days when legislators have been haggling over budgets, the governor seemed to be ignoring them on Thursday. He had plans to leave Albany and go to Syracuse to settle a football bet with Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota with a fishing trip this morning on Onondaga Lake. 
Then Mr. Pataki surprised lawmakers with a news conference Thursday afternoon and warned that the state might stop functioning if the Legislature passed the bare-bones budget it was considering. He said the legislators' $79.6 billion budget, which cuts about $4 billion from his original plan, would cause many programs, among them Medicaid, to run out of funds before the end of the fiscal year in March. 
"It does not come close to constituting what, by any reasonable definition, would allow for the continuance of governance for the balance of the fiscal year," he said. "This budget does not meet the needs of the people."
The governor and his aides also argued that the legislators had violated the State Constitution by changing language in the budget spending bills. They also held out the possibility that they would take the matter to court if the Legislature did not accept 800 pages of amendments to restore cutbacks.
The Democrats who control the Assembly and the Republican majority in the Senate stood their ground, however, and refused to consider the governor's amendments. They maintained that their spartan spending plan would provide enough money to meet legal requirements. That decision is ultimately up to the Democratic state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, who had not made a determination early today. Mr. McCall plans to challenge the governor in next year's elections.
Because the Legislature acted on the governor's bills without adding money or changing clauses, lawmakers argue, the parsimonious budget will become law immediately. The governor's counsel, James McGuire, however, said the governor might challenge that idea in court, because the Legislature deleted many changes to law that the governor had included in appropriations bills. 
Mr. Silver said the stripped-down plan "provides a complete, solid and balanced framework for meeting all state financial obligations and responsibilities for the entire fiscal year." Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader, acknowledged that the budget would cause some programs to run short of money in early September, but defended the tactic as the only way to break the stalemate with the governor. "We are trying to get some momentum," Mr. Bruno said. 
The budget essentially holds spending for most departments at last year's levels. It also cuts out any new programs or spending increases the governor proposed in January, except for a $382 billion increase in aid to schools, a figure school officials across the state are complaining is inadequate.
But the plan also omits several programs near to Mr. Pataki's heart. It eliminates, for instance, a $150 million fund for conservation and the acquisition of new parkland. It also effectively shuts down the state's economic development corporations, by not authorizing them to spend about $300 million on various projects.
The budget also holds hostage much of the $2.4 billion in federal money the state receives for welfare each year. It allocates $937 million for welfare payments, but puts the rest in a reserve fund. That means many important programs that help people move off the welfare rolls will not receive money in this budget. Among them is a $300 million program to provide 71,000 day care slots to single mothers and $323 million to pay for an earned-income tax credit. 
"It would be devastating," said Anne Erickson, the director of the Greater Upstate Law Project. "This has to be the beginning, not the end." 
On Medicaid, the Legislature has also created a headache for Mr. Pataki. The leaders eliminated changes the governor proposed that would have saved about $113 million in Medicaid spending on nursing homes and home care, ensuring a shortfall in those programs before the end of the year.
After Sept. 15, the budget would also eliminate about $54 million worth of appropriations, most of them for social services, approved in previous years, severely crimping many nonprofit organizations that depend on state grants.
Mr. Pataki predicted that many entitlement programs would run short of money. "We are looking at a so-called baseline budget that in fact, within a very short period of time, creates enormous difficulties for the government," he said. 
Still, Mr. Pataki vowed to keep the government running, by tapping reserve funds. "We'll look into this pool and that pool to try to keep the government running," he said. Senior lawmakers, however, said they hoped that the minimalist budget they debated would be a starting point for negotiations with the governor. 
"We have made this a bare-bones budget deliberately because we want to get the governor to participate," Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr. said during the debate.

HEADLINE: Metro Business Briefing Discrimination Claimed 

BYLINE:  By Alan Feuer (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Federal regulators filed a discrimination lawsuit yesterday on behalf of three female construction workers who claimed that they were sexually harassed and forced to pick up after their male colleagues while working at a job site in Brooklyn. The three women complained last year to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that they were subjected to a hostile work environment while working for Tratoros Construction Inc., a general contractor hired by the New York Housing Authority to renovate the Williamsburg Houses in northern Brooklyn. 
After investigating their claims, the commission filed a sexual discrimination suit on their behalf in United States District Court in Brooklyn. In its formal complaint, the commission said, "Offensive and unwelcome comments were made regarding women's menstruation and sexual activity." The complaint accuses one of the company's male supervisors of telling his male colleagues to leave the women alone "because they had cramps" and ordered the women to "change their Pampers." The supervisor also asked the women if they had recently had sex and publicly accused two of them of having an affair, according to the complaint. The three women say they were forced to clean bathrooms and kitchens and wash windows while the men did demolition and paint jobs. Chris Curis, a spokesman for Tratoros, said the company denied all of the allegations and he could not discuss continuing litigation. Alan Feuer (NYT)

HEADLINE: Bank of England Unexpectedly Cuts Benchmark Rate 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
The Bank of England unexpectedly trimmed its benchmark interest rate one-quarter point today, to 5 percent, responding to worsening economic tidings from the United States and Europe.
 The move surprised economists, who had expected the bank to hold rates steady. The European Central Bank, which sets rates for the 12 nations that have adopted the euro but not for Britain, decided separately today to leave its benchmark rate unchanged at 4.5 percent. 
 The Bank of England's move, its fourth reduction this year, pumped life into the stock market here, with the widely followed Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index closing at a four-week high, up 37.6 points, to 5,584.5. The bond market was mixed. Yields on the two-year government bond, which tracks central bank rates, fell to 5.12 percent from 5.18 on Wednesday. 
"Indicators of world economic activity have been weaker than expected over the last few months," the bank's Monetary Policy Committee said in a statement today. Minutes of the meeting will be released Aug. 15.
Economists pointed to rising unemployment and deteriorating business confidence in Western Europe and North America as important factors in the bank's decision. In Germany, the largest economy in Europe, executives are more pessimistic than at any time in five years. Worrisome statistics released in the United States recently included slowing orders for durable goods, less robust economic growth and an uptick in unemployment.
"The Bank of England is worried about the effects of the global slowdown on the U.K. economy, and they are willing to fight that by boosting domestic demand" through looser monetary policy, said Michael Taylor, a Merrill Lynch economist.
Analysts still expect Britain's economy to grow 2.2 percent in 2001, faster than either the United States or the big economies of Europe.
Inflation in Britain has remained below the bank's target of 2.5 percent for more than two years, leaving room to use monetary policy to stimulate the economy. While the inflation rate has crept higher lately, reaching 2.4 percent in the 12 months through June, the bank attributed the rise to "erratic factors," like food prices and said that "underlying price and cost pressures are expected to remain subdued."
The European Central Bank has had less maneuvering room, because inflation in its bailiwick has been running above its target for more than a year. But price rises have slowed somewhat in recent months, leading many analysts to predict a rate cut in August.
The move by the Bank of England today was especially surprising given past statements by bank leaders like Mervyn King, the deputy governor, who has championed predictability as the best recipe for stable markets.
Mr. King has also expressed concern about what he deems an "unsustainable imbalance" in Britain's economy -- domestic demand, as signified by retail spending and house prices remaining robust while export-driven industries like manufacturing falter. Exports now account for one-quarter of Britain's total output of goods and services.
Some economists echoed his concern today. "If the Bank of England is trying to stoke the domestic economy by throwing fuel on the fire, it might get out of hand later this year, especially if the global economy improves," said Peter Dixon, a Commerzbank Securities economist.
Spending by British consumers, equal to about two-thirds of gross domestic product, has been buoyant lately. Retail sales rose at their fastest pace in more than a year in July. Major store chains have been reporting robust gains: an 8.6 percent rise in sales at Carpetright, Britain's largest carpet retailer, in the three months ended July 31; a 19 percent jump at Hamleys, the toy store, in the 16 weeks to July 20; a 5.6 percent rise at J. Sainsbury, the No. 2 supermarket chain, in the 12 weeks to June 23.
Manufacturing, on the other hand, contracted for the fifth consecutive month in July. Invensys, a factory-controls maker; Marconi, a phone equipment manufacturer; and the Corus Group, a steel maker, have all announced major layoffs recently involving thousands of jobs.
The Confederation of British Industry had been lobbying for a rate cut, and Douglas Godden, the group's head of economic policy, praised the move today. "Interest rates are now at the appropriate level," he said.
Economists said lower rates alone would not bring fast relief to manufacturers, whose export sales continue to suffer from the strength of the pound, which fell to $1.4316 from $1.4345.
But homebuyers will see some benefit almost immediately. Three major mortgage lenders -- Halifax, Lloyds TSB and the Nationwide Building Society -- quickly followed the Bank of England's move with quarter-point reductions in their rates, making mortgage money cheaper here than at any time since 1963.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 
Cost-Cutting Helps Disney Exceed Earnings Forecast

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company announced quarterly financial results yesterday that modestly exceeded analysts' expectations.
 But expectations were fairly modest to begin with. Whether because of the nation's generally slow economy, the weak advertising market or the company's own missteps, none of Disney's operations are performing spectacularly these days. 
 When times are tough, however, the tough cut costs. Or at least that is what they do in Burbank, Calif., home to Disney, the world's second-largest media company after AOL Time Warner. Disney's recent cost-reduction moves have included the planned elimination of 4,000 jobs. 
The cost cuts helped the company generate earnings of 23 cents a share, excluding special charges, like those for job cutting, and adjusting for the effect of acquisitions. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call predicted earnings by that measure of 21 cents a share.
In addition, the company posted revenue of $5.98 billion. The analysts predicted revenue of $5.9 billion.
The results, for Disney's third fiscal quarter, which ended in June, were announced after the major financial markets closed. In after-hours trading, however, the company's shares rose as high as $27.35 from a 4 p.m. close of $26.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
"The third quarter of fiscal 2001 says a lot about our company," Michael D. Eisner, the company's chairman, said in a conference call.
Disney's revenue in the quarter, $5.98 billion, was down about 1 percent from $6.05 billion during the period last year.
The earnings of 23 cents a share were the same as in last year's third quarter. But overall earnings before charges -- and adjusted for acquisitions -- declined to $479 million from $495 million a year earlier.
The weak advertising market has not helped matters. Advertising supplies almost one-quarter of Disney's revenue.
Most of Disney's advertising revenue is generated by the company's media networks unit, which includes ABC and ESPN, as well as local television and radio stations. The unit's revenue declined almost 6 percent, to $2.14 billion from $2.27 billion in last year's third quarter. The division's operating income fell more sharply, by 29 percent, to $470 million from $662 million.
In addition to the weak advertising market's role in the declines, ABC's ratings have recently tailed off as well.
Revenue at Disney's parks and resorts was essentially flat, while revenue fell at its consumer products and Internet divisions.
Surprisingly, perhaps, the brightest spot in the company's results might have come from Disney's studio entertainment business, which is dominated by the film unit. Despite the failure of "Pearl Harbor" to achieve blockbuster status, the studio operation reported a 7.7 percent increase in revenue, to $1.34 billion from $1.25 billion.
Including the effect of charges, acquisitions and changes in capital structure, the company reported earnings of 19 cents a share, or $392 million. In the period last year, the company reported earnings of 21 cents a share, or $361 million.
In an interview, Thomas O. Staggs, Disney's chief financial officer, said the company was still on track to meet its financial target for the fiscal year of generating per-share earnings growth "in the high single digits."
Disney executives spent a fair amount of time yesterday citing their company's policy of refusing to comment on potential merger or acquisition activity.
Disney is one of a number of companies that appear to be considering whether to bid for all or a part of AT&T's cable television operation, the nation's largest. AT&T has said that a number of companies have signed confidentiality agreements as a precursor to negotiations.
AT&T has not said which or how many companies have signed the agreements. The Comcast Corporation, which set this process in motion last month with its unsolicited $44.5 billion bid for the AT&T cable unit, does not appear to be one of them.
"I can't comment on any of the things that are being rumored in the press now, but we certainly are keeping our eyes open," Mr. Eisner said on the conference call. "We keep looking, but we're not going to do it just to get a good headline in the media and then have to bear an unpleasant reality a year later. So we're going to do something, if we do anything at all, that we think really enhances our company."

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
The Item You Ordered May Be Sneaky

BYLINE:  By ELVIS MITCHELL 

 BODY:
It's safe to say that Antonio Banderas is the campiest heterosexual left in show business, if not on the planet. Pedro Almodovar often exploited the actor's luscious Iberian looks, musical vocal delivery and sexy caterpillar eyebrows, and Mr. Banderas was in on the joke. (He probably laughed at the semaphore-broad impression of him that Chris Kattan brandished before the cameras on "Saturday Night Live.")
 Mr. Banderas's awareness of his beauty and his sense of humor about it, as well as his swift reflexes as an actor, can often keep him from being absurd. When his falcon's-wingspan lashes start fluttering, you're laughing with him. But few directors have figured out a way to use him well in serious pictures, and Michael Cristofer, the director of the earnest romance "Original Sin," won't make that list. 
 As Luis, a worldly late-19th-century Cuban aristocrat who learns that he is naive after all, Mr. Banderas is shoved into a familiar position: the butt of the joke. But in "Original Sin" (and the most original thing about the picture is the use of that word in the title), he's not alone as the laughing stock. His co-star is Angelina Jolie, whose sultriness is so overwhelming that she's a real-life caricature as drawn by Mad magazine's Mort Drucker, with her sofa-cushion lips and a chin cleft so deep that mushrooms could grow in its shadow. And then there's her fearless avidity for acting. "You have no shame at all," Mr. Banderas murmurs incredulously.
It seems ridiculous to put these two in a romantic melodrama; their faces alone are melodramatic enough. It's hard to keep a straight face just thinking of Mr. Banderas and Ms. Jolie in the same shot, but "Original Sin" will bore the giggles right out of you.
Luis orders a bride via mail from the United States. "Love is not for me," he confesses to his housekeeper (Joan Pringle), who roars with laughter. All he asks of his potential bride is that she be kind and "young enough to bear children." Those are the qualifications stated by the plain Jane, or rather, plain Julia, who answers him, enclosing a photo so he won't get the wrong idea.
When the Julia who shows up and purrs at him doesn't resemble the photo, he is lost. "I deceived you," admits Julia (Ms. Jolie), but only because she didn't want a man to fall for her just because she's a pretty face. He'll forgive her just this once because it turns out he has also lied. He doesn't just work at a coffee plantation; he's one of its owners.
The story plunges more precipitously than Ms. Jolie's neckline. Luis does fall for her, despite his detachment. And when Julia walks out with his money, the only shock is that he is caught off guard. She has left him plenty of clues in her portentous rambling about love and lying.
After taking some time out for a debauch that hardly serves the healing purpose he had hoped for, Luis dedicates his life to finding Julia, joined by a private investigator, Walter Downs (Thomas Jane). Luis is always a couple of steps behind the plot, which leaves the audience in the position of stealing a couple of steps closer to the exit.
"Original Sin" -- adapted from Cornell Woolrich's novel "Waltz Into Darkness" (the basis also for Truffaut's "Mississippi Mermaid") -- drops the businesslike, detail-laden distance of the original material for an infatuation with heartbreak much closer in spirit to melodramas like the ravishing and unforgettable "Letter to an Unknown Woman." But everything in this film is forgettable, right down to bongos pounding on the soundtrack to indicate a quickening of the pulse, or characters closing the doors before the camera.
In one case, Mr. Banderas registers emotion by lifting his head in slow motion, a move right out of "The Young and the Restless."
Such recycling is appropriate because no one in the film is above lifting tricks from the recent past. As Luis's hearty-back-slap partner, Jack Thompson dusts off the accent he used in "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil."
Ms. Jolie seems to be working out the one she used in "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" for the Fruity Pebbles lines that pop up, to much hilarity, in the trailer for "Original Sin." Unfortunately, these lines are parsed out with sad economy in the movie itself; they could have been bits of flavor in the gruel of run-on and predictable exposition. Students of such junk will have to limit themselves to the stars' exhibitionistic displays of sweat and skin: not many actresses will follow an Oscar by starring in soft-core nonsense like "Original Sin." The beautiful and lurid cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto accentuates every jawline; it's lighted like the hallways of a Philippe Starck hotel. 
Mr. Cristofer knows what an open actress he has in Ms. Jolie, whom he directed in the race-with-deterioration melodrama "Gia" on HBO. In "Original Sin," it's Mr. Banderas's Luis, emotionally and financially in ruins, who disintegrates on-screen: his skin becomes as pallid as mottled, gray parchment. (Jolie is willingly tortured here, just so Mr. Cristofer can show his taste for perversity.)
"This is not a love story, but a story about love," Julia says in one of the flashbacks that frame "Original Sin." You'll probably just end up wishing that this middlebrow potboiler were about something, other than about two hours.
"Original Sin" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, strong language, luxuriant scenes of sexuality suited to its eventual run on pay-per-view, and a few other baroque and piquant instances of garish behavior.

HEADLINE: A Call for Broadband 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Shakeout in Fiber Optics" (editorial, July 29): 
High-tech industry leaders believe that rapid and widespread deployment of broadband is key to the future of their industry and the United States' economy. 
Unfortunately, outdated government policies lack the right incentives for companies like Verizon to invest in broadband.
Congress can revive the economy and the high-tech sector by passing the Internet freedom and broadband deployment act, which promotes broadband growth by lifting rules that suffocate investment, innovation and competition.
New Yorkers are saving up to $700 million a year on local and long-distance services as a result of intense competition. Opening long-distance data markets to all comers can achieve similar results.

HEADLINE: A Top Treasury Official Favors Quick I.M.F. Aid to Argentina 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
The Bush administration signaled support today for accelerating an international loan to Argentina, which is struggling to contain a financial crisis. 
 The Treasury Department's top international official, John B. Taylor, headed to Argentina on an emergency fact-finding trip. Mr. Taylor, who is under secretary for international affairs, said before his departure for meetings in Buenos Aires on Friday and Saturday that he thought there was a good chance that the payment of new loans to Argentina by the International Monetary Fund would soon be approved. 
 He said officials were also considering a range of other options to help the Argentines, though he declined to say what ideas were on the table. 
Argentina is scheduled to receive an additional $2.4 billion in I.M.F. loans this year, and the next installment had been expected to be approved in September. 
Mr. Taylor spoke to reporters after the White House said President Bush had phoned President Fernando de la Rua of Argentina to express support for his efforts to stabilize the country's finances by imposing a government austerity program. 
On Monday, the Argentine Senate adopted a plan to cut spending and balance the budget, aiming to calm the fears of investors that the nation would default on its debt payments. Those fears have made credit markets wary about the debt of some other developing economies. 
Mr. Bush called Mr. de la Rua on Wednesday, and in a 10-minute conversation they exchanged views on Argentina's financial situation, an administration spokeswoman, Mary Ellen Countryman, said. 
Mr. Taylor said that Washington favored releasing the $1.2 billion September loan installment to Argentina early. That money, and another $1.2 billion scheduled for November, are part of $7 billion in I.M.F. resources available to Argentina under an existing loan program. 
There have been reports that the Argentines may request a larger loan, and Mr. Taylor would not say whether the United States would support increasing the size of the I.M.F. package. 
"There are a whole range of discussions going on," he said, adding that "we will be discussing all of these things" in the meetings with government officials, the Argentine central bank and Argentine business executives over the next two days.

HEADLINE: The Dangers of Voting Outside the Booth 

BYLINE:  By Norman J. Ornstein; Norman J. Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, led the voting procedures group of the Constitution Project's Forum on Election Reform.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Major reports on election reform have come out in the past few weeks from scholars at the California Institute of Technology and M.I.T., a commission led by former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, and the Constitution Project of Georgetown University's Public Policy Institute. Most reaction in the press has focused on the groups' varying proposals that seem related to last fall's Florida election, like eliminating punch-card voting machines; letting everyone who comes to the polls on Election Day vote, even though a lack of registration might disqualify ballots later; extending voting hours; and perhaps moving Election Day to a holiday or a weekend. Virtually unmentioned is something all three reports have in common: a concern about the explosion in voting that doesn't involve going to the polls on Election Day.
 Almost unnoticed last fall, in the frenzy over the close Florida results, was the startlingly large proportion of the votes in the presidential election -- about 20 percent -- that were cast by these alternative methods. All of Oregon's ballots and more than 50 percent of those in Washington State were cast by mail, for example; more than 25 percent of votes were filed early in states like Tennessee and Texas; and nearly 25 percent of voting in California was by absentee ballot. 
 The trend is both clear and alarming. One-fifth of our voters voted well before Election Day -- before we saw the candidates in action under the pressure of the final days of the campaign. They voted from a smaller base of knowledge than the rest of us had; it was the equivalent of deciding the winner of a basketball game at the end of the third quarter. Some of those voters, of course, could not get to the polls because of illness or travel, but this group is usually less than 5 percent of voters in any election.
Serious election fraud -- through forgery, chicanery and badgering of voters -- is all too possible when voters don't go to the polls. Judges have nullified results because of fraud in absentee ballots, for example, in the Miami mayoral race of 1997 and in some local elections in the past decade in South Carolina.
Alternative voting also delayed some states' 2000 election results -- and with them, the overall result for the whole country. Waiting for ballots to arrive and verifying and counting millions of ballots takes time.
Many state secretaries of state and local election officials who were contacted by the Constitution Project brushed off or bristled at these criticisms. They focused instead on the convenience for voters of filling out a ballot at home and sticking an envelope in the mail, the economies of using fewer poll workers and voting machines, and an assumption -- which the commissions on voting did not find to be borne out -- that alternative voting enhances participation in elections. For election officials in Oregon and Washington, the belief in the efficacy of voting by mail has taken on almost religious significance.
But the consensus of the social scientists, political philosophers, elected officials and others on the commissions that studied voting is in the opposite direction. The National Commission on Federal Election Reform, led by Presidents Ford and Carter, said it was troubled by the trend toward mail voting, early voting in person and absentee voting without requiring an excuse. "Though this trend is justified as promoting voter turnout, the evidence for this effect is thin," its report said. "Analysts have even noted the possibility that voter turnout in such states may eventually decline, as the civic significance of Election Day loses its meaning."
The report from Caltech and M.I.T. recommends: "Restrict or abolish on-demand absentee voting in favor of in-person early voting." And the Constitution Project report decries unlimited absentee balloting and votes by mail, strongly endorsing "the proposition that voting at the polls serves basic and historically rooted objectives" and adding: "The gathering of citizens to vote is a fundamental act of community and citizenship. It provides the greatest security for enabling voters to cast their ballots free of coercion. It facilitates prompt counting and verification of results."
To many, anything that makes it easier for people to vote is automatically a good idea. It will be a Herculean task to reverse this kind of thinking, especially in the West. But we should be doing everything possible to keep alternative voting from expanding until Election Day becomes a meaningless time. As Congress and the states prepare to move on election reform, they should keep in mind the consensus view of every major panel that has examined this issue.

HEADLINE: Dressing for 2, Buying for 1; 
Retailers Vie for More Fashion-Conscious Moms-to-Be

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
Tucked in the corner on the third floor of Barneys in Beverly Hills, past the $500 gowns by Dosa, across the aisle from the $1,000 Piazza Sempione jackets, a mannequin displays the latest by Diane Von Furstenberg. A cream-and-brick-colored dress is stretched tight across the belly -- which looks seven months pregnant -- and from the sleeve dangles a $325 price tag.
 With many expectant mothers older, wiser and more fashion conscious these days, merchants at all levels of the retailing hierarchy seem to be vying for the buying dollars of women dressing for two. And, reflecting the digital times, in the last year mainstream retailers like Gap and its Old Navy chain have begun selling maternity wear online. 
 Even Barneys New York, which caters to trendsetters from New York to Los Angeles, is wooing moms-to-be. Four racks here are crammed with velvety-soft hip huggers and enough silk shirts and cashmere sweaters to make a Vogue editor swoon. Last year Barneys introduced Procreation, its exclusive line of maternity wear. It is not ordinary fare, though. In its Beverly Hills store, a stylish leather jacket (with ample room for an expanding middle) sold for $600. 
"We cater to the woman who is aggressively fashion conscious," said Melissa Seay, a store manager.
Indeed. But it is retail stores and designers, dogged by years of sagging profits and a fickle customer trained to seek bargains, that have become more aggressive. In the nation's fashion capitals, upscale boutiques and department stores like Fred Segal, Liz Lange and Saks Fifth Avenue are packing stores with stretchy slim pants and body-hugging T-shirts, once the uniform of only the most trim.
At the same time, the retailers that have long specialized in maternity wear are fighting back, hoping to stem the competition by emphasizing their experience and devotion to the market.
Why all the interest in mothers-to-be now? For one thing, professional working women, many of whom have opted to have children in their late 20's and 30's, are demanding well-made, stylish clothes that fit not only their hectic lifestyles, but their bodies as well.
The birth rate among women in their 30's is at its highest level in more than three decades, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, which tracks births, while the rate for women in their 20's fell in the 1990's.
Older expectant mothers have money to spend, and a honed sense of personal style from years of dressing themselves. As a result, they are unwilling to trade in sleek pants and jackets for tent dresses or shifts with bow ties.
It is no surprise, then, that for its fall season the Gap has chosen the slogan "Gap Maternity. What you'd wear even if you weren't." Industry analysts are suggesting that the tiny market once dominated by a handful of players could reach $2 billion in sales in the coming year.
"It's really what I would call niche marketing at its most extreme," said Wendy Liebmann, president of WSL Strategic Retail, a Manhattan consulting firm. "When the business started to get tougher, people began to look outside of their core business."
Recent history suggests that specialty sizes are big sellers. Clothing made for petite women is now an $8 billion business, a 31 percent increase since 1998, according to NPD Fashionworld Consumer, which tracks the women's clothing market. By contrast, sales of misses' clothing in the same period remained flat. Witness, too, the boom in sales of plus-size fashions, which last year, NPD said, totaled $19.7 billion -- a 10 percent increase in two years. 
But unlike shoppers buying misses, petite or plus-size clothes, pregnant women do not have the luxury of waiting for an item they adore to hit the sale rack. "When they need it, they need it now," said Faye Landes, an analyst who covers retailing for Sanford C. Bernstein. "If you see it in your third month, you only have a short window of time to wear it."
As a result, retailers have a captive audience who will pay any reasonable price -- or unreasonable, depending on how extravagant buyers feel -- for clothes they not only want, but need. "Who knows?" mused Ms. Liebmann of WSL. "Maybe La Perla will sell a really sexy nursing bra for $433."
Rebecca Matthias, president and chief operating officer of Mothers Work in Philadelphia, a leading maternity retailer for more than two decades, scoffs at the new competition. Her company, which owns three of the dominant maternity-wear chains, sells clothes in 765 stores and outlets. Its chains are A Pea in the Pod, which caters to affluent shoppers; Mimi Maternity, which sells midprice fare, competing with Gap and Old Navy; and Motherhood Maternity, which sells the least expensive brands.
Competitors, she said, come and go. The market is small; only about four million babies are born each year. Repeat shoppers are fickle. It is the inexperienced, and demanding, first-time mothers who tend to buy the most. "It's a very hard market to serve," she said. 
In mid-July, Mothers Work announced that although total net sales climbed in the quarter ended June 30, sales at stores open at least a year in the three chains' shops were down 2 percent from the year before. Michael Devine III, Mothers Work's chief financial officer, said sales were down most at A Pea in the Pod and Mimi Maternity, which he attributed to recession jitters. But it is these higher-priced stores, too, that are the targets of newer entrants. 
On the 27th floor of a downtown Los Angeles building, Laurie McCartney, chief executive of the online retailer eStyle, is cooing over a rack of clothes packed with some of the e-tailer's private-label offerings. "Look at these!" she said, holding a $138 pair of "pleather" pants (read: fake leather) in the air. She grabbed an eye-catching pair of flat-paneled gray pants, priced at $68 a pair, with enough stretch to accommodate a growing belly. Estyle even makes a versatile little black dress. The price? $78.
Estyle, through its Babystyle maternity collection, began selling maternity clothes online last year. Of course it helps that Cindy Crawford, the supermodel and fashion impresario, is not only a consultant for the collection but a pitchwoman, too. About half of all maternity sales come from its private-label offerings, Ms. McCartney said. (The company also offers a variety of styles from different clothing makers.) To broaden the private brands, the company plans to expand into select retail stores, too, she said. 
"As a new mom you feel bombarded," Ms. McCartney said. "From my standpoint it is great to have options. It's about feeling good about yourself. I mean, you can't take a break and let yourself go for a year. In places like New York and Boston you have to look presentable."
To help the company keep in touch with trends, a group of expectant mothers make the trek to the company's headquarters downtown each month to talk about maternity clothes. There they slip into private dressing rooms and are asked to try on skirts, pants, dresses and, yes, pleather. Then they discuss the clothes over lunch -- what they like (cotton and Lycra blends) and what they don't (scratchy seams that chafe the belly).
Such research is particularly essential with maternity clothes, analysts say, because a woman's body changes weekly. So, too, does the fit of the clothes. And that, Ms. Matthias said, is why she does not fear her online competitors. Women need to try on clothes to see how they will fit their particular shape. "The priority customer is a first-time mom," she said. "She doesn't know size. Women want to touch and feel."
But Ms. Matthias acknowledged that while more than two million women visit Mothers Work stores each year, the most marked growth the company has experienced recently is on the Internet. Web sales are up 50 percent from last year, she said. "We do a big business," she said. "I really believe e-commerce is all about brands."
That is exactly what mainstream retailers are betting on. The Gap, whose operating margins dropped 42 percent between 1998 and 2000, according to Sanford C. Bernstein, has no plans to sell Gap maternity clothes in stores yet. "Maternity is a unique business," said Cindy Capobianco, the vice president in charge of marketing the Gap brand. But the collection is growing. 
It includes not only long-time favorites, like paneled slim pants, but seasonal offerings as well. The company now sells 120 maternity pieces, up from 16 when the company introduced the line in May 2000. "It was our best opportunity to get it out quickly," she said. "We were concerned about accessibility."
But it also allows the company to test women's appetite for affordable maternity clothes without having to spend money to rebuild displays or take other favorite products off the shelves. Upscale and mainstream retailers have ventured into maternity clothing before, which concerns some analysts who question whether the recent trend is a passing fad.
"It is an efficient way for Gap to see how big the opportunity is without having to redo their stores," Ms. Liebmann said. With Gap, "you know what you are getting, making it easier to shop online."
Besides, she added, it is not as if shoppers are taking much of a fashion risk with a Gap T-shirt and pants. "If you said Versace maternity, you'd figure you want to go in and try it on," she said, laughing. "I mean, you may not be able to decide where the slit goes."

HEADLINE: Mexico Vows To Retaliate Against U.S. On Trucking 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
President Vicente Fox vowed today to bar American trucks from Mexico until Mexican truckers were allowed on American highways, raising the volume in a war of words between the two governments.
 Mr. Fox reacted strongly to a United States Senate vote on Wednesday to impose restrictions on Mexican trucks, which followed a House vote to bar Mexican trucking companies from seeking operating licenses in the United States. 
 "There currently aren't any American trucks in Mexico, and there won't be any unless we reach a mutual, equitable and well-thought-out agreement on the issue," Mr. Fox said during a news conference with Tony Blair, the visiting British prime minister. "If no agreement is reached, there won't be any Mexican trucks up there, because they don't want them, but there won't be any American trucks down here, either." 
Neither nation now uses its trucks to import and export goods more than a few miles past the border. Neither government wants that commerce to stop.
The narrow border zone is where the bulk of their $250 billion in annual trade is conducted. Long-haul trucks transfer their trailers to short-haul trucks, which ferry the goods across the border through the maze of customs officials and brokers.
Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, which took effect in 1994, Mexican long-haul trucks were supposed to be allowed into California, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico by the end of 1995, and then anywhere in the United States this year. President Bill Clinton blocked that provision from taking effect, largely at the behest of the Teamsters union.
President Bush promised to reverse the Clinton decision, and international long-haul trucking was to have begun.
That did not happen. Congress held hearings, focusing on the inspection records of the older, more decrepit short-haul trucks that shuttle back and forth at the border, rather than the more modern long-haul carriers used in Mexico. They raised the specter of unsafe trucks driven by poorly trained foreigners threatening American lives.
Despite a warning by the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, that a Congressional roadblock "violates the spirit of Nafta by holding Mexico to different standards than it holds Canada and the United States," the House and Senate passed separate restrictions.
But Mr. Bush has promised to veto them. 
If and when the trucking provisions take effect, it would be years before many Mexican trucks head north or American trucks head south, said Duane W. Acklie, chairman of the American Trucking Associations, which represents 3,000 trucking companies in the United States. Several other American and Mexican trucking executives concurred.
Their companies need bilingual drivers who can meet state and federal requirements on both sides of the border, they said. They will have to qualify in the Mexican and American states where they do business. They must pay federal, state and local taxes and fulfill insurance requirements. 
Mexican carriers would face federal safety and insurance audits, not to mention daunting competition from American companies for which every cost of doing business, except labor, is cheaper.
In time, Mr. Acklie said, American trucking companies may buy up Mexican carriers. Or they may begin exchanging drivers, rather than cargoes, at the border. But today, he said, few if any American or Mexican trucking companies could handle long-haul operations across the border.
Those practical concerns have been drowned out by a battle of politics and policy. And that battle could escalate.
The United States, by blocking Nafta's trucking provisions, has violated the accord, a five-member arbitration panel of two Americans, two Mexicans and a Briton unanimously ruled six months ago. Under Nafta's rules, Mexico could take retaliatory steps that would inflict far more economic pain than Mr. Fox's warning of today -- steps like blocking imports of American goods. 
But for now, that threat, like the argument over international trucking, is largely theoretical, though potentially dangerous down the road.

HEADLINE: Clinton Lays Out Future for Library, and Himself 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Aug. 2 

 BODY:
In a pep talk to a receptive hometown crowd, former President Bill Clinton said today that he would use his presidential library and policy center here to advance themes that were central to his presidency.
 Among them, he said, were spreading economic opportunity to the disadvantaged; improving schools, health care and the environment; fostering understanding of the world economy; and promoting peace and reconciliation across racial and religious lines. 
 Though Mr. Clinton, 54, did not say how he would translate those themes into specific projects, he made it clear that he intended to be an active former president, along the lines of former President Jimmy Carter. 
"I think I was given a phenomenal opportunity to serve as president," Mr. Clinton told about 1,000 well-wishers in the lobby of a science and technology museum here. "And I think that I should spend the rest of my life trying to give back out of a wealth of experience that no one could ever have unless they had been president. So I think I should try to focus on doing things that I can do just because of the life I had."
Mr. Clinton's appearance here served as a bookend to one of the most public weeks of his postpresidency. It began on Monday with something of a hero's welcome in Harlem, where the former president moved into his New York office. Characteristically, he chose not to arrive quietly, but with great fanfare and a full program of speeches.
While New York is his new home, because of the decision by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to run for the United States Senate there, Mr. Clinton's roots clearly remain in Arkansas. He decided during his presidency that he would have his library built here on the banks of the Arkansas River, making it the anchor of a continuing and largely successful redevelopment of the Little Rock riverfront.
Mr. Clinton said today that while some of his work would be conducted in New York and around the world, "the heartbeat will be here."
Mr. Clinton, who has been intimately involved in the planning for the library complex, has already approved plans by the New York architects James Polshek and Richard Olcott for a glass and steel structure that extends over the river. On Friday, he is to meet with the exhibit designer, Ralph Appelbaum, who worked on the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington among other projects, to review preliminary plans for displays. He is also expected to announce plans on Friday for a project on racial and religious reconciliation, which will be financed with a grant from SBC Communications.
It can be difficult, Mr. Clinton said today, to design an attractive presidential library because of the requirement that millions of documents be protected from natural light. He said that much of the archival material from his administration would be stored below ground. Exhibit space will be above ground and flooded with sunlight.
"I wanted to build a building that would last," Mr. Clinton said, "and that would be a great and lasting gift to the people of Arkansas who have been so good to me."
The library is intended to be the centerpiece of a 27-acre project that will include parkland, a policy center, a public policy school affiliated with the University of Arkansas and a restored pedestrian bridge between Little Rock and North Little Rock. A foundation hopes to raise $200 million to pay for construction and to establish an endowment for operating costs. Skip Rutherford, the president of the foundation's board, said fund-raising was going well, but he refused to discuss it in detail.
Groundbreaking has been delayed by lawsuits against the City of Little Rock. One suit challenged the city's use of revenue bonds to finance the $16.5 million purchase of land for the library. That claim was rejected by the Arkansas Supreme Court, but the plaintiff has since filed a second, slightly different suit. Another lawsuit objects to the city's use of its powers to condemn land for the project. The city won that case in the lower courts and is awaiting a decision on an appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court.
"We're one Supreme Court decision away," Mr. Rutherford said.
Construction could begin as early as November and be completed in 2004, he said.
Mr. Clinton, who raised money aggressively for the project during and after his presidency, acknowledged today that it would be expensive. He was heavily criticized shortly after leaving office for granting a pardon to Marc Rich, whose former wife, Denise Rich, had contributed $450,000 for the library.
"You can't do this unless you're willing to spend some money," Mr. Clinton said. "But whatever it costs, when people are happy going into it 100 years from now, when our great-grandchildren are going in there and walking along the river and being a part of it and being proud of it, we will be very glad that we made this investment."

HEADLINE: Gephardt Launches an Attack on Bush's Foreign Policy 

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
Drawing clear battle lines with the White House on foreign policy, Representative Richard A. Gephardt accused the Bush administration today of an obsession with missile defense and of pursuing a unilateralist approach to world affairs that risks antagonizing Russia and undermining relations with Europe.
 Mr. Gephardt, the House minority leader, vowed to unite Democrats and persuade Republicans to forge a bipartisan majority in Congress to block any missile defense system that would violate the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. He also defended formal arms control negotiations as essential to maintaining the nuclear peace. 
 On Russia, Mr. Gephardt sketched his version of a framework for new relations, one that would reject ultimatums on missile defenses and warhead reductions but never shy from complaining about Russian failures to protect press freedoms, ethnic relations and religious tolerance. Eventually, he said, the goal would be to "extend to Russia the prospect of NATO membership."
The Missouri Democrat, widely seen as an undeclared candidate for his party's presidential nomination in 2004, recently returned from a visit to Europe and Russia, and said NATO allies "are worried that America is on the sidelines."
"They think the Bush administration has embraced a go-it-alone policy that undermines international security, hurts our economic and environmental interests and prevents us from seizing a historic opportunity for engagement with Russia," he said.
When Mr. Gephardt's speech, given to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace today, is added to recent statements from three Senate Democrats -- Carl Levin of Michigan, chairman of the Armed Services Committee; Joseph R. Biden of Delaware, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; and Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader -- a consensus party agenda on international security comes sharply into focus.
While differences are inevitable, the Democrats generally unite in arguing that nuclear deterrence still works, even against Iraq and North Korea. They broadly agree that there is no need to rush deployment of missile defenses, although continued research and development, within treaty constraints, in pursuit of a limited system is a national interest.
The Democrats also hold that President Bush, by rejecting important treaties, is leading Americans into a new isolationism that will weaken their ability to pursue a broad range of global interests, and that the United States should return to negotiations on global warming and stick to peacekeeping commitments.
Mr. Gephardt focused his harshest criticism on the Bush administration's dealings with Moscow on arms control and missile defense.
Speaking of Russia, he said: "This is a country that is strapped financially in the most severe way. And they've got multiple thousands of warheads. How can they keep them in repair? How can they avoid accidents? Are we worried about their command and control, about something getting out of hand? So that to me is the major threat that we still face. And treating that in a sensible way is severely complicated by our obsession with going ahead with this missile defense plan, which we haven't proven can work, and we haven't developed, and that we certainly haven't worked out with the Europeans and the Russians."
The president's senior advisers say that the Bush administration will apply the standard of American national interest in determining whether to support or reject international accords. For example, in the case of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, administration officials say, the pact would damage the American economy and harm global financial health.
And on relations with Russia, the administration has stated that the ABM treaty is outdated and stands in the way of moving rapidly toward both historic reductions in arsenals and building a defense against ballistic missiles launched by an enemy -- or accidentally by Russia.
Mr. Gephardt said the administration "has ratcheted up its unilateral rhetoric," which he said had led to "the largely symbolic, yet potentially destabilizing treaty between Russia and China, designed in part to counter U.S. global dominance." He was referring to a treaty of "friendship and cooperation" signed by the two countries last month. 
Mr. Gephardt said the president's policies had already resulted in Russian threats to place more nuclear warheads on its missiles and a Russian decision to block American efforts to strengthen international sanctions on Iraq.
"These examples, I think, demonstrate a simple yet profound fact of international relations," he said. "One nation, acting alone, cannot possibly build a lasting strategic framework to which all other nations submit."
After the speech, Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, tossed the unilateralist charge back at Mr. Gephardt, accusing him of working to shackle the president's authority to negotiate trade deals and saying that he and other Democrats were thwarting the tenets of the North American Free Trade Agreement by trying to keep Mexican truckers off American highways.
"Given his isolationist record on Mexico, on Nafta, on free trade, the president hopes that Mr. Gephardt will pursue a more internationalist course this fall on trade promotion authority," Mr. Fleischer said.
Mr. Gephardt had anticipated that charge in his speech, saying that in order to get a trade agreement through Congress, "it's got to have enforceable provisions on labor and environmental matters" and on human rights.

HEADLINE: Core's Split on Energy Is Costly to Democrats 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
President Bush won a lopsided victory on energy this week because the Republican package in the House split two of the Democrats' core constituencies: environmental groups and organized labor.
 In their votes on the energy plan late Wednesday and early today, many Democratic representatives, including Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, and David E. Bonior of Michigan, the minority whip, opposed big increases in automobile fuel efficiency. Moreover, three dozen Democrats, including at least five members of the Congressional Black Caucus, broke ranks to support drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on the ground that it would create thousands of jobs. On both issues, Democrats provided the margin of victory. 
 The support came even though Democrats loudly opposed Mr. Bush's energy plan when it was unveiled in the spring. The party's House and Senate leadership vowed to promote conservation measures and oppose drilling in wilderness areas.
Many predicted that differing visions of environmental and energy policy would be a centerpiece of the 2002 Congressional campaigns.
Unions, however, including the United Auto Workers and the Teamsters, along with the powerful auto and energy industries, weighed heavily on some Democrats, overwhelming the influence of environmental groups that command less political loyalty and money. 
"I have no idea what they think they've accomplished," said Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust. "Democrats simply walked away from the public policy they endorsed all spring and handed the president a great victory."
Environmentalists and unions developed broad alliances on trade and globalization issues in recent years and were among Al Gore's most reliable supporters last year in the presidential campaign. But the jockeying in the final hours before the House vote exposed that bond as tactical and possibly temporary.
Influential unions abandoned environmental groups to support Republican leaders and industries on auto efficiency and drilling. The split assured that Democrats would lack unity on the issues as well.
"What environmentalists fail to realize is that we are not environmental organizations, we are labor organizations," said Jerry Hood, who headed the Teamsters' lobbying effort in favor of drilling in the wildlife refuge. "Our responsibility is to grow the work force." 
The Teamsters argued that opening the wilderness refuge to oil and gas exploration could create more than 700,000 jobs around the country, although environmentalists disputed those estimates as wildly inflated.
Mr. Hood said environmental groups had overplayed their hand by opposing numerous energy production measures rather than trying to ensure that oil exploration and production was environmentally sound.
"They could have helped write the rule book," he said, "but instead they just oppose everything."
The Senate, controlled by Democrats, is still expected to block drilling in the wildlife refuge and to push for stricter fuel efficiency standards than the ones approved by the House.
Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, has vowed to filibuster any bill that would open the wildlife refuge to drilling. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, has predicted that the Senate will reject drilling.
But the defeat for the environmentalists' two priorities in the House gives the White House unexpected momentum. The same unions that held sway over House Democrats have influence in the Senate, too, and the victory will give Republicans leverage when the two bodies reconcile House and Senate versions of the bill in committee.
"A lot of the pundits said we'll never get an energy bill out of the Congress," Vice President Dick Cheney said today, adding, "We had, I thought, a surprising strong vote over here last night."
Some of the 38 Democrats who supported the president against environmentalists on Arctic drilling and some of the 86 who supported his position on fuel efficiency appeared to do so sheepishly. Repeated phone calls to at least 20 Democrats who voted with the president were not returned today.
One decisive factor appeared to be support for drilling and opposition to substantially higher fuel efficiency standards among Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Representatives Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, Edolphus Towns of New York, Earl F. Hilliard of Alabama and James E. Clyburn of South Carolina were among Mr. Bush's supporters on both measures. Each refused to comment.
James Harris, an aide to Mr. Towns, said the congressman was persuaded by arguments -- made largely by the Teamsters' lobbyists -- that Arctic drilling would create jobs "for the native community in Alaska."
Environmentalists were also stung by the opposition of several senior Democrats. In addition to Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Bonior, Representatives James L. Oberstar of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure; Paul E. Kanjorski of Pennsylvania, the minority whip at large; and Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, all voted in accordance with the president on at least one of the two major energy amendments.
Mr. Oberstar and Mr. Kanjorski, who voted to support Arctic drilling, did not return phone calls today. Environmentalists said their decision to vote in favor of drilling, along with the absences or abstentions of several other Democratic leaders, was crucial to the outcome. At 223 to 206, the vote to drill in the area would have gone the other way if nine Democrats had voted differently.
Environmentalists suffered an even bigger defeat on their push to raise fuel efficiency standards for automobiles, which have not been altered by Congress since 1975. Support for higher standards appeared to surge this spring as Democrats rallied to oppose Mr. Bush's energy plan, calling it skewed in favor of production measures over conservation. Many Democrats argued that higher fuel economy standards for cars could do more to help the nation meet its energy needs than the most optimistic estimates of what could be recovered from the Arctic refuge.
But that support evaporated in recent days. Auto makers and the powerful United Auto Workers union lobbied Democrats to oppose a bipartisan amendment. Environmentalists, who had once counted on the auto workers' remaining on the sidelines for the vote, said the union ended up lobbying aggressively after the Big Three car companies in Detroit threatened to cut jobs if they were forced to comply with tougher rules. 
"We had to fight the White House, the Republican leadership, the Teamsters union and, it turns out, the Democratic leadership" on the auto efficiency vote, said Dan Becker, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "It's surprising we did as well as we did."

HEADLINE: MEASURE DEFINING PATIENTS' RIGHTS PASSES IN HOUSE 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
The House of Representatives passed a bill tonight that would create federal rights for millions of Americans in managed health care plans, after revising the legislation to limit lawsuits against insurance companies.
 In approving the legislation by a vote of 226 to 203, the House handed an important political victory to President Bush, who had argued that earlier versions of the bill would encourage frivolous lawsuits. 
 Under the legislation, health insurance plans must provide patients prompt access to medical specialists, must allow women to visit obstetricians and gynecologists without a referral and must permit patients to obtain emergency care at the nearest hospital, even if it is not affiliated with a specific health plan.
The vote tonight followed a long, tumultuous debate in which Democrats denounced the legislation as a sham, providing less protection to patients than to health insurance companies. It was the third time in four years that the House had passed legislation to define patients' rights. Earlier bills died. Shortly after the vote the House recessed until Sept. 6. 
No Republicans voted against the bill tonight, and only five Democrats voted for it.
At the heart of the latest bill is a compromise negotiated by the White House and Representative Charlie Norwood, the leader of a six-year campaign for patients' rights, who unexpectedly made a deal with Mr. Bush this week. 
"This is a real victory for American patients," Mr. Norwood said. "We not only passed a bill tonight, we passed a bill that the president has agreed to sign into law."
Under the bill, patients could enforce their rights by suing H.M.O's in state court for medical decisions. But there would be limits on damages, including one of $1.5 million in punitive damages and another of $1.5 million for pain and suffering. Damages for economic losses if medical decisions were made improperly would be unlimited.
Mr. Bush welcomed the final vote, saying it "brings us an important step closer to ensuring that patients get the care they need and that H.M.O.'s are held accountable."
Mr. Bush had wanted to limit suits to federal court, where damages are often lower than in state court. Mr. Norwood had wanted higher ceilings on damages.
Before voting on final passage of the bill, the House approved the Bush-Norwood proposal as an amendment by a vote of 218 to 213. The tally seesawed, and the two sides were tied for a few suspenseful moments before the result was announced. 
This vote also generally followed party lines. Three Democrats joined 214 Republicans and 1 independent in supporting the Bush-Norwood plan. Six Republicans joined 206 Democrats and 1 independent in opposing it.
In today's debate, Democrats criticized the compromise, saying it would cripple the enforcement of patients' rights. But Republicans hailed the agreement as a victory for consumers and common sense over trial lawyers, and they said it would inoculate Republicans against political attacks on the issue.
Mr. Bush praised Mr. Norwood, a Georgia Republican, as "realistic and reasonable." But the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, and the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, were among the members of their party who said they had been betrayed by Mr. Norwood, their former ally. They denounced Mr. Norwood and the deal he struck with Mr. Bush to limit lawsuits against insurers and health maintenance organizations. 
Today's House vote sets the stage for negotiations with the Senate, which passed a similar bill in late June by a vote of 59 to 36. Patient protections in the two bills are nearly identical, but the means of enforcing those rights are different.
Under both bills, people with insurance are guaranteed access to clinical trials of new drugs and an independent medical review of decisions denying claims for health benefits. The Senate bill gives patients a much more extensive right to sue health plans for injuries caused by the denial of care. The only limits on suits in the Senate bill are those provided under current state laws.
Mr. Bush threatened to veto the Senate measure, saying it would permit a flood of lawsuits that would drive up insurance costs and increase the number of people without coverage.
Negotiations between the House and the Senate will probably be difficult.
"We are not going to give up or give in," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.
Senate Democrats want higher limits on damages than the House bill provides.
Democrats, believing that voters tend to trust them on health care issues, say they can hold out for concessions. Republicans may feel more pressure to make such concessions as the campaign season heats up next year. But Democrats also run a risk. Republicans could portray them as obstructing progress on the issue if the conference committee reaches an impasse, as similar negotiations did last year.
Negotiators from the House and Senate will come under immense pressure from consumer advocates, doctors, insurers and employers lobbying for or against the bill or some of its specific provisions. 
The Bush-Norwood compromise is embodied in an amendment to the original patients' bill of rights. Critics said the compromise would override many state laws and state court decisions that provided greater protection to patients.
Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the chief Democratic sponsor of Mr. Norwood's original bill, said: "The president and Mr. Norwood propose creating a new federal law that applies to state courts just for H.M.O.'s. Under this proposal, H.M.O.'s retain a very special status and cannot be held accountable for their negligent and harmful actions in the same way your doctor or hospital is."
Representative Greg Ganske, the Iowa Republican who was chief House sponsor of the Norwood bill this year, said: "Charlie was freelancing. He did not have our authorization. This was Charlie's own deal with the White House."
Mr. Norwood said it was ridiculous for people to suggest that his bill had been written by insurance companies. "The insurance industry can't stand me," he said. "They have had me on their dartboard for years."
Under the compromise, patients could sue health insurance plans in state court for injuries caused by the denial of care. But most aspects of the litigation would be controlled by federal law and the amount of damages would be limited by federal law.
Mr. Dingell said this arrangement "wipes out state laws like those already in effect in California, Texas and New Jersey."
The American Medical Association, a strong supporter of the original patients' bill of rights, said the compromise would override the laws of 10 states that allow injured patients to hold H.M.O.'s accountable in state court. The states are Arizona, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Texas, Washington and West Virginia.
Representative Marge Roukema, a New Jersey Republican who supported Mr. Norwood's original bill, arrived at the Capitol today with an open mind, saying she wanted to evaluate the compromise he had negotiated with the White House. Several hours later, she decided to vote against the compromise.
"This is absolutely an atrocity for New Jersey," Mrs. Roukema said of Mr. Norwood's latest proposal on H.M.O. liability. "It would deprive New Jersey patients and doctors of protections that have existed for several years and were just strengthened in the last few weeks."
Mr. Norwood said, "I am not completely satisfied with the provision in our bill that protects state law." He promised that in negotiations with the Senate, he would try to clarify that provision of his bill, which is meant to protect state laws regulating the quality of medical care.
In recent years, some courts have allowed patients to sue H.M.O.'s, but John E. Stone, a spokesman for Mr. Norwood, said the outcome of such lawsuits was always in doubt.
"You may win, you may not," Mr. Stone said, depending on the judge and the legal theories used by the plaintiffs' lawyers.
Texas Democrats like Representatives Lloyd Doggett and Jim Turner were particularly annoyed at the compromise.
"Mr. Bush now seeks to override the effective state guarantees that we got enacted over his objections in Texas," Mr. Doggett said.
Democrats complained that the Norwood proposal would give H.M.O.'s an unfair advantage in court. It would, they said, establish a legal presumption in favor of H.M.O.'s when they prevail in administrative appeals to independent medical experts but it would not give consumers the same presumption if they prevailed.
Mr. Gephardt captured the flavor of all the Democratic criticism, saying: "This bill is better for H.M.O.'s than for patients. It ought to be called the H.M.O. bill of rights. For the first time in the history of this country, we will have a federal tort law that applies to malpractice and injuries caused by H.M.O.'s and insurance companies." 
In many cases, Mr. Gephardt said, the new limits on damages -- $1.5 million for pain and suffering, $1.5 million for punitive damages -- "will be less than what you would get if you were under state law."
Before adopting the Norwood compromise, the House approved an amendment intended to help people obtain health insurance. The proposal approved by a vote of 236 to 194 would expand access to tax-free savings accounts used to pay medical expenses and would make it easier for small employers to band together and buy health insurance.
Republicans said Mr. Bush had gone a long way toward protecting Republican candidates against political attacks on the issue of patients' rights. Democrats agreed, with Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts saying that "Mr. Bush has substantially reduced the risk" to himself and other Republicans.
Business groups and insurers criticized the deal. They said it was better than the original Norwood bill, but would still allow far too many lawsuits against health plans and employers that provide health benefits to their employees.
Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, said, "The president deserves a lot of credit for ending partisan gridlock on this issue." Despite all the Democratic criticism, Mr. Boehner said, the bill "goes far beyond what we have in law today."
The White House took pains to emphasize that Mr. Bush had been actively engaged in the fight for patients' rights legislation. 
Still, Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, said: "This is not a compromise. It's a victory for those who oppose a patients' bill of rights. We provide protections, but there's no enforcement, so H.M.O.'s can continue to deny reimbursement without any fear of repercussions."

Dingell of Michigan, Democrats, stuck with their patients' rights bill yesterday, opposing a compromise amendment. (Paul Hosefros/The New York Times)(pg. A18) Chart: "COMPARE AND CONTRAST -- 2 Versions of Patients' Rights"The House and Senate versions of the patients' bill of rights are almost identical in the protection they offer people with insurance. DENIAL OF CARE -- Patients can appeal the denial of care by seeking an independent medical review. Ob-Gyn -- Women can visit obstetricians and gynecologists without a referral or prior authorization. Emergency care -- Patients can get emergency care at the nearest hospital regardless of whether it is affiliated with their health plans. Specialists -- Health plans must provide prompt access to medical specialists. Drugs -- Doctors can prescribe any medically necessary drugs regardless of whether drugs are on the insurer's list of preferred medications. Clinical trials -- Health plans must provide access to clinical trials of experimental therapies if no standard treatment is effective. The bills differ in the way patients would be allowed to enforce their rights. Under the House bill:Injured patients could sue H.M.O.'s in state court for medical decisions. The bill allows unlimited damages for economic losses, but it sets a limit of $1.5 million on damages for pain and suffering and a separate $1.5 million limit on punitive damages. Under the Senate bill:Patients could sue insurers in state court for medical decisions or in federal court for administrative decisions. In federal court, there would be no limits on damages for economic loss or pain and suffering. Patients could win up to $5 million in civil penalties resembling punitive damages. In state court, damages would be subject to the limits of state law, if any such limits exist.(pg. A18) Chart: "Coming to Terms on Differing Bills"After the monthlong Congressional recess in August, House and Senate leaders will pick lawmakers to meet in conference to work out differences between the two versions of the patients' bill of rights legislation. Republicans have criticized the Senate bill, saying it would allow a flood of litigation that would ultimately drive up the price of health insurance to the point that many people could not afford it. Democrats have said the House bill protects insurance companies, not patients. Polls show that many voters are more likely to trust Democrats on the issue, a finding that Democrats say makes them want to push hard for concessions. The risk for each party in not moving toward compromise is that the voters could view it as obstructionist. Similar legislation passed both houses in the last Congress, but died in the conference committee. In that case, Republican leaders in the Senate passed a more restrictive bill, and the House version offered patients a broader set of rights. House Republican leaders picked representatives for the conference committee who had voted against the bill, an unusual tactic that set off an uproar among supporters. This year, such a step is unlikely. The conference discussions are still likely to be tense, but there is a possibility that most House and Senate conferees, voting separately, can agree on one bill.

 BODY:
Senate Committee Rejects Consumer Panel Nominee
The Senate Commerce Committee voted along party lines to reject President Bush's choice to head the Consumer Product Safety Commission, handing him his first nomination loss.
 By a 12 to 11 vote, Democrats rebuffed the nomination of Mary Sheila Gall, saying her record as a current member of the commission showed an alarming disregard for children's safety and warning that her elevation to chairwoman would benefit manufacturers, not consumers. Page A1. 

House Passes Patients' Rights Bill
The bill would create new federal rights for millions of Americans in managed health care plans and was revised to limit lawsuits against insurance companies. A1.

Microsoft Suffers Legal Setback
A federal appeals court refused to reconsider its finding that Microsoft illegally blended Internet browsing software with its monopoly product, the Windows operating system. The move could open the way for courts to second-guess Microsoft's product designs. C4.

Companies Sharing Liability Risks
A wave of shareholder lawsuits is prompting liability insurers to make corporate clients share more of the cost of settlements or awards in cases where corporate executives and board members are accused of not acting in the interest of shareholders -- by, for example, hiding losses or turning a blind eye to overstated revenue. Now, some companies will have to pick up more of the tab -- at least 15 percent and probably closer to 25 percent of any amount paid, insurers say. C3.

Intel Spurs Rally in Tech Stocks
Stocks rose after Intel signaled the beleaguered personal computer industry may turn the corner. The Nasdaq composite index rose 19 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,087.38.

Factory Orders Fell 2.4% in June
Factory orders fell 2.4 percent in June, a steeper drop than expected, led by declines in demand for computers and transportation equipment, a government report showed. The decline came after a 2.2 percent increase in May, the Commerce Department said. A separate report showed that the number of workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits declined last week to the lowest level in almost five and a half months, a sign that the worst of the job reductions may be over.

HEADLINE: A Difference A Day Made 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 

 BODY:
Just when Congressional Republicans had seemed in dangerous disarray, President Bush in a gratifying 24 hours won House passage of his comprehensive energy plan and eked out a victory on a patients' bill of rights.
 Mr. Bush's back-to-back successes changed the mood in the capital overnight, giving ebullient Republicans a set of issues to carry to the public over the August recess. At a rally on the East Front of the Capitol, party leaders took turns proclaiming that the president had made good on his signature campaign pledge to provide a new kind of leadership. 
 Vice President Dick Cheney spoke of "one of the most remarkable six months, I think, in any administration." And Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the minority leader, said, "This is a president that has changed the tone in Washington." 
Still, the change in tone has come about only in the Republican-run House, where Mr. Bush proved able to negotiate within his own party. And even there, his win on a patients-rights bill was perilously narrow.
He has yet to master relations with the Democratic-run Senate. There, a committee voted today to reject a Bush nominee for the chairmanship of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. And on Wednesday, the full Senate defied Mr. Bush's veto threat and voted to require Mexican trucks to meet strict safety standards on American highways.
In fact, what was most evident today was that the two parties are developing distinct agendas. The Republicans waved tax-refund checks in the air at their rally to showcase the $1.36 trillion tax cut that Mr. Bush pushed though Congress in the spring. Under the rubric "securing America's future," they also emphasized the president's energy plan, his education initiative and the Republican version of a patients' rights bill.
An hour later, House Democrats, on the West Front of the Capitol, focused on a different set of issues that they said were languishing in a "G.O.P. junk yard," among them the overhaul of the campaign finance law, "quality education," a more robust patients' rights bill, prescription drug benefits and fiscal discipline.
This could all lead in the autumn to a season of grand compromises should both parties decide that they need legislative achievements to bring to the voters in 2002. President Bill Clinton and the Congressional Republicans had just such periods of shared accomplishment for parts of 1996 and 1997 when they judged it to be in their mutual interest.
But it could just as easily lead to another period of gridlock judging by the sharp partisan divide that the House showed on the patients' rights bill tonight. In that case, each party would try to brand the other as the obstructionist as Republicans and Democrats take their competing agendas to the voters next year.
Already, the parties are starting to lay blame. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, slammed the "purely partisan nature" of the Senate committee vote against Mr. Bush's nominee to head the safety commission. And of patients' rights Mr. Fleischer said, "At the end of the day there will be a bipartisan majority and there will be a more partisan minority."
The Democrats in turn accused House Republicans of scuttling popular measures sent forward by the Senate.
"Since Democrats took control of the Senate a few months ago," said Representative Martin Frost, Democrat of Texas, "the mantle of partisan obstructionism has passed largely into the hands of Republican leaders in the House of Representatives."
Adding to the possibility of gridlock is that government analysts are expected to release new projections this month showing that the federal surplus will be far less than previously projected because of the sagging economy and the Bush tax cut.
That means there will no longer be a windfall of cash to help the parties avoid hard choices as the new fiscal year approaches. Instead, lawmakers will have to put much of their energy into finding a way to pass the annual spending bills and still finance the president's call for a national missile defense system, a more robust Pentagon budget as well as expanding education aid to levels Democrats want.
"It's going to be hard to accommodate all of these promises," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut.
Still, no matter how touch-and-go it was at times, for Republicans today was a day to be savored. A month ago, the president appeared on the defensive. Winning House support for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge seemed a lost cause, and few could see how the Republicans could beat back the Senate's version of the patients' rights bill.
But on the energy issue, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, was particularly instrumental. He sought allies wherever they existed, even meeting quietly with the Teamsters president, James P. Hoffa.
And Mr. DeLay exploited the differences between the Democrats' core constituencies of labor and environmentalists. Crossover Democrats gave him the votes he needed to secure the drilling plan even as moderate Republicans defected.
Republicans credit Mr. Bush personally with defeating the Democrats' version of a patients' rights bill after early months when he seemed off balance on the debate, surprised by how entrenched all sides were on an issue fought over for six years. 
He threatened to veto the version of the bill approved by the Senate even though it is popular and he had campaigned in favor of a national bill of rights. The stand put him in some personal political peril. But it also gave him an argument to use with wavering Republicans who had supported the Democrats' version of the measure in the past. If they voted for the Democrats' bill, he said, they would never see it become law.
Republicans said that Mr. Bush lobbied with an intensity he had not shown on any other issue -- even his tax cut -- and that as the stakes rose for him, so did his mastery of the issue. Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican who had voted with the Democrats in the past, had two meetings with Mr. Bush at the White House.
"I felt, at the first meeting in the Cabinet room, he did not make that good a case," Mr. King recalled. "I almost got the impression he was going through the motions. The second meeting in the Oval Office it almost reminded me what I'd heard of Lyndon Johnson. He totally dominated the meeting."
Then Mr. Bush entered negotiations with Representative Charlie Norwood, a Georgia Republican and a leader of the bipartisan coalition supporting the bill Mr. Bush opposed.
The very fact that Mr. Bush was negotiating helped him within his party. As Mr. Norwood's coalition rejected White House ideas, more Republicans came back into their party's fold, suspicious that the Democrats simply wanted the president to capitulate.
Finally Mr. Norwood, too, came back into the fold, striking a compromise with Mr. Bush that he did not run by his co-sponsors and breaking their coalition. 
The issue now goes to a House-Senate conference committee to become Exhibit No. 1 in the tug of war over whether the parties will compromise or take an issue to the polls. Democrats who have long been the driving force behind the movement to regulate H.M.O.'s believe they have the public well on their side, giving them confidence that they can hold out for further change.
Today they asserted that the compromise would in some cases override state laws that give patients a broader right to sue H.M.O.'s. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, "We are not going to give up or give in."

HEADLINE: To Butt In or Not In Human Rights: The Gap Narrows 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Given all the interest these days in the founding fathers, especially John Adams, it shouldn't be surprising that some writers are citing different Adamses as they wage one of the longest-running debates in American history. What are the respective roles of human rights and the national interest, or morality versus power, in formulating foreign policy?
 In one recent book, "In Our Own Best Interest" by William F. Schulz, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, the Revolutionary leader Samuel Adams is cited to support the argument that human rights should be the essential ingredient of the American national philosophy. "We may look up to armies for our defense, but virtue is our best security," Adams wrote. "It is not possible that any State should long remain free, where virtue is not supremely honored." 
 In contrast, another recent book, "Does America Need a Foreign Policy?" by Henry A. Kissinger, cites a later Adams, John Quincy, who, as secretary of state, asserted that the United States "goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy." Writing in 1821 in response to calls to help Greece in its war of independence against the Ottoman Turks, he elaborated on the reasons for this caution: the country "well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own . . . she would involve herself beyond the power of extrication in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy and ambition, which assume the colors and usurp the standards of freedom." 
Much has been written in recent years about human rights and foreign policy, but the books by Mr. Schulz and Mr. Kissinger -- one a professional human rights advocate, the other the world's most famous foreign policy "realist" -- set out each side of the debate in its most modern guise. Mr. Kissinger's is the broader book, a series of recommendations on many foreign policy questions, including some related to human rights, especially the effort to create an International Court of Justice to deal with human rights crimes. Mr. Schulz's only concerns are human rights and a foreign policy that gives it priority. Together the two books demonstrate the many differences between the two sides in this debate, but they also disclose at least a small degree of convergence as well, one that has been reflected in other writings.
"I would argue that you can pay attention to real concerns and still see human rights as an important part of foreign policy," Joseph Nye, the dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said in a telephone interview. "But while human rights is part of foreign policy, it isn't foreign policy in itself, because a foreign policy is an effort to accomplish several objectives: security, economic benefit as well as humanitarian benefits.
"In the past, the realistic tradition excluded human rights as idealism. But realists thinking only of power and idealists thinking only of morality create a false dichotomy. The question is not an either/or one; it is one of implementation; how do you do it?"
In fact, ever since President Jimmy Carter re-established human rights as a priority in American foreign policy, it has been a part of every administration's foreign policy arsenal. Even Ronald Reagan, deemed generally a realist in foreign policy, often resorted to the language of human rights -- the concept of democracy versus tyranny -- in waging the cold war. Recent American military interventions, from Somalia to Haiti to Kosovo, have been undertaken primarily for humanitarian reasons, to stop or to try to avert atrocities, and President Bill Clinton apologized for not taking action to stop the slaughter in Rwanda.
Meanwhile, actions in the name of human rights have become regular occurrences. President Bush recently appealed to China to stop the prosecutions of Chinese-Americans on what appear to many in the United States to be spurious charges of espionage. A Spanish judge got the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet detained in England for 18 months in what turned out to be an unsuccessful effort to put him on trial for atrocities committed in Chile during his reign.
Meanwhile, one of the world's most infamous human rights violators, former President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, was given over to The Hague to be put on trial. And on Thursday, a former Bosnian Serb general, Radislav Krstic, was convicted of genocide by the United Nations war crimes tribunal and sentenced to 46 years in prison.
Human rights, in other words, is on the agenda, and neither realists nor idealists would remove it.
Mr. Schulz accuses American policy makers of being myopic, for example, in providing arms and training to governments in South America and elsewhere that have been guilty of human rights atrocities. But the main point of his argument is that paying attention to humanitarian considerations is consistent with rigorous concepts of the national interest. In his view, they advance it.
" 'Realists,' " Mr. Schulz argues in his new book, "regard the pursuit of rights as an unnecessary, sometimes even a dangerous extravagance, often at odds with our national interest. What they seem rarely to garner is that in far more cases than they will allow, defending human rights is a prerequisite to protecting that interest." 
Mr. Kissinger, though probably the kind of realist that Mr. Schulz has in mind, does not seem to fit that description, since, in his new book, he allows that human rights is a legitimate goal of foreign policy. "The growing concern with human rights is one of the achievements of our age and is certainly a testament to progress toward a more humane international order," Mr. Kissinger writes.
But Mr. Kissinger, distinguishing himself from those he unfavorably views as moralists, also writes that "humane convictions" have become "so integral a part of the American tradition that both treasure and, in the extreme, lives must be risked to vindicate them anywhere in the world." And this, Mr. Kissinger says, is going too far.
As the contrast between each writer's favorite Adams shows, both are well within a long American tradition. For most of its history, the United States played the international game in accordance with principles laid down by the coolly calculating Alexander Hamilton, whose policy was to encourage a balance of power in Europe so as to keep the countries there too preoccupied to become involved in the affairs of the American continent.
This changed with American entry into World War I, when President Woodrow Wilson asserted what he saw as new and better principles: not merely maintaining a balance of power but also creating a cooperative world order based on the universal applicability of democratic institutions.
In his book, Mr. Schulz, who would seem very much to be in the Wilsonian tradition, lists the many ways he says the national interest would be served by paying greater attention to human rights. His main reason is very similar to one of Wilson's: namely that democracies almost never wage war against each other, and if avoiding war is a primary goal of diplomacy, then, he argues, a foreign policy divorced from human rights is less likely to succeed.
"The conclusion is inescapable," Mr. Schulz writes, "that the more respect for human rights we can help engender in a country, the less likely that country is to go to war with us or other like communities." 
Mr. Kissinger, squarely in the Hamiltonian tradition, argues that the modern-day impulse toward humanitarian intervention is in some ways a return to an old pattern of behavior that preceded the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, after which noninterference in the internal affairs of other countries came to be the first principle of foreign affairs. In what Mr. Kissinger treats as a revolutionary change, this principle has been replaced by another: "The proposition that certain universal principles are deemed enforceable, either by the United Nations or, in extreme situations, by a group of states (for example, NATO in Kosovo)."
The effort of a Spanish judge two years ago to have Mr. Pinochet extradited to Spain for his crimes in Chile, even though Chile's parliament had decided not to prosecute Mr. Pinochet, is a striking example of what Mr. Kissinger calls the international enforcement of "universal principles." That was an effort that pleases Mr. Schulz and that distresses Mr. Kissinger.
Indeed, Mr. Schulz says, "If you commit a crime, you should do the time," meaning that the international community should set up more tribunals like the ones created to deal with war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, so that the worst human rights violators can be held accountable for their acts. He adds, "It is breathtaking to think that it is in the national interest of the United States to isolate itself from an unprecedented global attempt to hold human rights criminals accountable for their crimes." 
Mr. Kissinger finds it "breathtaking" as well, but for a different reason. He is in favor of holding war criminals accountable, but he says the courts that try them must serve clearly stated, limited purposes. For Mr. Kissinger, the Pinochet case was a warning signal of the dangers that could emerge as the concept of universal jurisdiction gains strength. It could mean essentially that any judge in any country could indict any person for any crime, ignoring the mechanisms for justice or for reconciliation established in the country where the crimes were committed. Indeed, one of the objections that has been raised about the treaty that would set up the International Criminal Court is that Mr. Kissinger could be indicted for the role he played as a member of the Nixon administration both in the 1968 bombing of Cambodia and in the overthrow of the Chilean government that brought Mr. Pinochet to power.
"Should any outside group dissatisfied with the reconciliation procedures of, say, South Africa be free to challenge them in their own national courts or those of third countries?" Mr. Kissinger asks rhetorically. "Any universal system," he writes, "should contain procedures not only to punish the wicked but to constrain the righteous."
Yet in the end, the difference is, as Mr. Nye put it, not between two mutually exclusive goals but between two visions of attaining the same goal: more justice in a better world.

HEADLINE: Index of the Service Sector Shows a Slumpin July 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
A gauge of service activity slumped in July, pressed by declines in new orders and prices and weakness in employment.
 The National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday that its monthly nonmanufacturing index fell to 48.9 in July from 52.1 in June. Any reading below 50 suggests activity shrank in the services sector, which includes everything from transportation to legal and financial services. The nonmanufacturing index also fell below 50 in May and April. 
 Economists caution that the four-year-old index has yet to prove itself as a reliable economic indicator. 
 Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at UBS Warburg, said, "When you go through the numbers, it's hard to say we're getting any clear pickup yet." The economy still looks fairly weak, he said, and everything is on track for the Federal Reserve to ease again in August.
 But Mr. O'Sullivan said the economy "is not getting worse than what it was, and it will get better over the second half of the year."
 Economists expect that the Fed's rate cuts so far this year, $38 billion in tax rebates landing in mailboxes nationwide, and a sharp drop in energy prices will help revive growth later in the year.
 The Fed has cut short-term interest rates six times this year in a bid to bolster growth, and it is widely expected to trim rates another quarter percentage point at its next policy meeting on Aug. 21.
 The survey's employment index rose slightly, to 46.4 in July from 45.1 a month earlier, but it indicated that the services sector has shed jobs for five consecutive months.
 The nonmanufacturing new-orders index, seen as a leading indicator of future activity, tumbled to 48.6 in July from 53.1, erasing June's gains. In another sign that demand has fallen off sharply, the backlog-of-orders index fell to its lowest level in five months, to 42.5 from 49.0.
 Prices paid by companies fell for the first time since February 1999 as the slowdown eroded pricing power, with the prices index falling to 49.0 in July from 55.5 in June.

HEADLINE: Back in Hong Kong, Accused Spy Himself Is Being Spied On 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 3 

 BODY:
Security guards stand watch at either end of the long corridor outside Li Shaomin's cramped office here. When visitors drop by, the guards, who wear university badges, track their comings and goings on cellular phones.
 They are there to shield Mr. Li from the sudden notoriety that comes from being a convicted spy who was deported to the United States by Beijing and has returned here to reclaim his teaching job. 
 But they could just as well be watching Mr. Li, a Chinese-born American scholar who was told today that he could keep his position at City University, where he is a marketing professor.
For Mr. Li, 45, the decision puts an end to a painful, frightening chapter in his career. After being convicted of spying for Taiwan, however, he is likely to face continued scrutiny by his employer and his adopted city.
"I never wanted to become famous for something like this," Mr. Li said in a surprisingly relaxed interview as he waited for the decision of the university's executive council.
It is not clear that he can even continue his work. When Mr. Li was detained by the Chinese police on Feb. 25, he had been trying to visit Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, to research several companies as examples of economic development.
Now Mr. Li's ties to those companies are severed. And though his office, in a suburban part of Kowloon, is only a few miles from the border, he may never be allowed to set foot in the land of his birth.
"They told me, 'You hate the Chinese government,' " Mr. Li said of the officials who interrogated him four hours a day during his five-month detention. "But I love my native country. It was because of my concern for China's future that I got involved in activities that got me into trouble."
Mr. Li denies he spied for Taiwan. He believes the charges stem from the fact that his research in the late 1980's and early 1990's was financed by foundations on the island. Mr. Li has written about many aspects of Taiwan-China relations, ranging from economic ties to the growing number of cross-strait marriages. One of his articles is titled "What China Can Learn From Taiwan."
As part of this research, Mr. Li said, he asked another China-born scholar, Gao Zhan, to collect articles for him on a trip to China in the early 1990's. Ms. Gao, a sociologist at American University in Washington, was detained in Beijing on Feb. 11 and accused of passing documents to Mr. Li. She was also tried, convicted and deported. 
Mr. Li said he did not even use the documents in his research, and lost them in moving from the United States to Hong Kong in 1996. "To be honest with you, I don't even remember what they are," he said. "They were so insignificant."
Mr. Li said his research did not involve state secrets. Given China's elastic definition of secret, however, he said it was possible he had used restricted material. "As a scholar, you try to get as much information as you can, regardless of the sources," he said.
Looking back, Mr. Li believes his troubles had less to do with documents than with his politics: as a doctoral student at Princeton, he became involved in the democracy movement that sprang up after the dismissal of Hu Yaobang as Communist Party chief in 1987, and signed an open letter criticizing Beijing.
Mr. Li said he still dreamed of teaching in Beijing. And, as he said he told his interrogators, his criticism of China's government does not make him a spy.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Dow and Nasdaq Both Fall Amid Conflicting Reports

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stocks declined yesterday after a government report showed that employment in July was not quite as weak as many on Wall Street had forecast.
 A slowdown in the number of job losses, to 42,000, and the unchanged unemployment rate of 4.5 percent indicated that economic deterioration might be turning into stagnation. 
 But the report led some investors to think that this, in turn, might discourage the Federal Reserve from continuing its aggressive campaign of cutting interest rates in an effort to avoid a recession. Moreover, the continued economic weakness offered no promise for a rebound in corporate profits any time soon. 
"The employment report creates confusion," James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, said. "It wasn't good enough to say there's going to be an imminent turnaround. On the other hand, it wasn't so terrible that you could say at least the Fed is going to ease."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 38.40 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 10,512.78. For the week, however, it was up 0.9 percent.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 21.05 points, or 1 percent, to 2,066.33, but it rose 1.8 percent for the week.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 6.40 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,214.35. It was up 0.7 percent for the week.
Based on yesterday's employment figures, there was a growing consensus among analysts that the Fed's policy makers were unlikely to cut interest rates more than a quarter of a percentage point when they meet on Aug. 21 and that this might be the last rate cut for a while. That belief weighed on bond prices, although they cut their losses from an early sell-off.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 98 27/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, was also unchanged at 5.16 percent. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/32, to 97 1/32. Its yield was unchanged at 5.58 percent. 
A further sign emerged that corporate profits might not improve any time soon. Thomson Financial/First Call, a research firm, said analysts were now expecting earnings to be flat in the fourth quarter instead of turning around. In July, earnings had been expected to grow 5.5 percent in the quarter.
Still, some investors seemed to be largely engaged in taking any recent profits from the stock market, analysts said. "Chips are giving back their gains, and we have the Friday factor at work, which means reasonably light volume," said Alan Ackerman, chief market strategist at Fahnestock & Company. "We have a market that's still within a tight trading range and no indication that it's likely to break out of that range in the immediate term."
Semiconductor stocks -- which jumped after Merrill Lynch upgraded the sector earlier this week and Intel said the worst was behind it -- were among the day's notable losers.
Intel fell 41 cents, to $31.68; Xilinx lost $1.89, to $41.45; Advanced Micro Devices dropped 51 cents, to $19.25, and Altera lost $1.36, to $31.24. 
Noven Pharmaceuticals, a maker of drug delivery products, tumbled $14.34, to $18.98, after warning that its earnings this year would fall short of expectations because of a drop in orders. 
Cisco Systems fell 20 cents, to $20.05, as investors awaited its earnings report on Tuesday. 
Among the stocks weighing on the Dow were American Express, which dropped 97 cents, to $40.45; Procter & Gamble, which fell $1.24, to $70.22, and Philip Morris, which fell 67 cents, to $45.17.
Sensormatic Electronics, which makes anti-theft equipment, soared $8.18, to $23.12, after Tyco said it would spend $2.3 billion to acquire it. Tyco fell 51 cents, to $53.29. 
Walt Disney rose 10 cents, to $26.60, after it reported quarterly earnings that were at the high end of Wall Street's expectations. 
Lucent Technologies gained 29 cents, to $6.60, after it said Thursday that it had raised nearly $2 billion in a sale of convertible stock that would be used to pay down its debts and for revamping purposes.
Despite yesterday's somewhat disappointing economic data -- the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its nonmanufacturing index fell to 48.9 in July from 52.1 in June -- investors appear to be having more muted reactions to such news.
"Industries and companies are starting to talk about having the worst behind them in their business; and maybe the pickup in orders isn't quite there yet, but there's a growing chorus of, 'Yeah, we think the worst is behind us,' " said Joseph Battipaglia, the chairman of investment policy at Gruntal & Company.
"The statistics that bear out the weakness don't have the same impact that they did 12 months ago," he added.

HEADLINE: Treasury Nominees Confirmed After Trade Protest by Helms 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3 

 BODY:
The Senate confirmed eight nominees to top Treasury Department posts today, including Kenneth W. Dam as deputy Treasury secretary, after the Bush administration agreed to address an unrelated issue raised by a Republican senator who had blocked action on the appointments.
 The Senate approved the nominations without a roll-call vote after the administration agreed to work out a compromise with Senator Jesse A. Helms of North Carolina on a trade dispute involving textile imports. 
 Senator Helms had held up a vote on the nominees for months, leaving Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill without a deputy and slowing work throughout the department. 
Mr. Dam, deputy secretary of state in the Reagan administration, had most recently been a law professor at the University of Chicago and was a director of Alcoa, where Mr. O'Neill was chairman before retiring at the end of last year. 
The other nominees approved today were Peter Fisher as under secretary for domestic finance; Jimmy Gurule as under secretary for enforcement; Michele Davis as assistant secretary for public affairs; Rosario Marin as United States Treasurer; Henrietta Holsman Fore as director of the Mint; Carole L. Brookins as United States executive director of the World Bank; and Randal K. Quarles as United States executive director of the International Monetary Fund.
Senator Helms has been trying to make sure that provisions of a trade law passed last year opening the United States textile market to Caribbean nations would not harm textile producers in North Carolina.
He has been pressing the Customs Service, which is drawing up regulations defining the types of fabric covered by the trade law, to enforce the law in a way favorable to domestic producers. 
In a letter to Senator Helms today, Mr. O'Neill pledged that the administration would not issue final regulations covering the definition but would work with the senator to come up with compromise legislation.
In a statement, Senator Helms said 40,000 jobs in North Carolina and 120,000 jobs nationwide could rest on the definition.

HEADLINE: Jobs Data for July Hint That the Economy May Be Stabilizing 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
American companies continued to eliminate jobs by the thousands last month, but the economy also showed some tentative signs of stabilizing, the government said yesterday.
 Private-sector payrolls fell by another 73,000 jobs in July, roughly similar to the pace in recent months. Manufacturers -- which often provide a glimpse of where the economy is heading -- cut their fewest number of jobs in 10 months, while layoffs in the much larger service sector increased, according to the seasonally adjusted numbers in the Labor Department's monthly jobs report. 
 The nation's unemployment rate held steady for the second consecutive month at 4.5 percent -- surprising analysts, who had generally expected it to rise. The jobless rate and the payroll number are calculated from separate surveys, and the two do not move in tandem every month. 
Still, the unemployment rate has risen since October from a 30-year low of 3.9 percent, and economists expect it to continue increasing for the remainder of the year. In recent weeks, DuPont, JDS Uniphase and PricewaterhouseCoopers, among others, have announced further layoffs.
But yesterday's report, which was the first broad look at the economy in July, suggested that conditions might no longer be deteriorating as rapidly as they were earlier in the year. In addition, the Labor Department said on Thursday that first-time claims for unemployment insurance had fallen in the weeks since it conducted its survey of the job market in July.
"This month's numbers are obviously better than expected," said the labor secretary, Elaine L. Chao. "That suggests some stability." 
She added, "Whether it's an improvement, at this point I think it's a little premature" to say,
Stocks fell slightly yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average off 38.4 points, to 10,512.78; bond yields were unchanged. Analysts said the jobs report added to the evidence indicating that the Federal Reserve would probably reduce lower its benchmark interest rate by another quarter of a percentage point at its meeting later this month. But barring unpleasant surprises in the weeks ahead, the Fed's campaign to restart the economy -- through rate cuts totaling 2.75 percentage points over seven months so far -- is nearly over, analysts predict.
Despite its promising hints, the labor market in July offered little to suggest that an economic recovery had already begun. Including a 31,000 increase in government payrolls, the economy lost 42,000 jobs last month and now employs 132.4 million workers. Since March, it has lost an average of 65,000 jobs a month. From the end of 1996 until March, the economy had added about 235,000 jobs a month.
The government also revised its employment statistics for May and June yesterday, saying the job market was somewhat better than had been initially thought. The private sector lost 120,000 jobs during the two months, not 149,000, and federal, state and local governments created 68,000, not 43,000.
"You can find a few glimmers of hope beneath the surface," said Richard D. Rippe, the chief economist for Prudential Securities, "but nothing absolutely definitive to indicate that there is an upturn or that one will emerge soon."
In recent months, the layoffs have spread to service companies, which account for about four out of every five jobs in the United States. In July, private-service employment fell by 26,000, led by cuts at temporary-employment companies (42,000), department stores (11,000) and supermarket and other food stores (10,000). Restaurants, hospitals and other health care companies continued to add employees.
An economic slowdown typically hurts manufacturers first -- because consumers and executives can more easily delay the purchase of new furniture than the payment of electric or medical bills, for instance -- but the contrast has been unusually severe recently. Manufacturers have been hurt by a strong dollar and the rapid corporate cuts in spending on software and equipment. 
Since April 1998, the portion of American jobs in manufacturing has fallen to 13 percent from 15 percent, said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. It is "an extraordinary shift over a relatively short time," he said
The shift may now be ending, however. Manufacturing employment fell 49,000 in July, less than half the amount it had in the three prior months. This suggests "manufacturing is in the trough of the business cycle and should be poised to make a recovery," said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
It is not clear, however, when manufacturing will begin to grow again. The Labor Department said yesterday that some of the deceleration in the sector's job cuts could have reflected the government's seasonal adjustments, which try to account for typical reductions in factory employment during the summer. 
Across all sectors, weekly earnings for nonsupervisory employees rose 0.3 percent, to $490.77 in July. The increase was smaller than the 0.5 percent increase in June, and many economists expect wage growth to remain mild as unemployment increases.
That, in turn, reduces the chance that the Fed's rate cuts will cause inflation to take off in the coming months.
"There's really no inflation risk in the economy," said Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch, adding that inflation patterns usually lag those of economic growth.
The Labor Department uses two separate surveys -- one of households and one of businesses -- to evaluate the job market each month, and the two surveys offered conflicting pictures yesterday. 
According to the household survey, which also produces the unemployment rate, total employment actually rose by a stunning 447,000 jobs in July. But because the household poll uses a much smaller sample, its month-to-month changes are often misleading, said Thomas J. Nardone, the Labor Department economist who oversees the survey.
Through much of this year, the household poll has reported worse news than the business survey, and this month's swing means that the business survey's earlier results are considered likely to be closer to reality.
In July, the unemployment rate -- which considers only those who are actively looking for work to be jobless -- for blacks fell to 7.9 percent from 8.4 percent. Among Hispanics, it dropped to 6 percent from 6.6 percent.
Even as the job market continues to worsen, it remains in one of its strongest conditions in three decades. July was the 49th consecutive month that the unemployment rate was below 5 percent. It never fell below that point in the years from 1973 to 1996.

PERSON: Robert Miles Runyan 

HEADLINE: Robert Miles Runyan, 76, Adroit Graphic Designer, Dies 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN HELLER 

 BODY:
Robert Miles Runyan, a graphic designer who changed the way that American corporations communicated by designing innovative annual reports, died on July 27 at his home in Ajijic, Mexico. He was 76.
 The cause was Shy-Drager syndrome, a neurodegenerative disease, said Gary Hinsche, his former business partner. 
 Mr. Runyan was a pioneer of visual corporate communications, the concept of an integrated package of logos, trademarks and graphics that establish the identity of businesses in the public's consciousness. 
In 1959, Mr. Runyan produced his breakthrough work, the annual report for Litton Industries, which changed how corporations presented their yearly financial statements to stockholders. Federal law required that this information be released regularly, but most such reports were dry and formulaic. 
The 1959 Litton report, however, looked more like a magazine or even an art book than a spreadsheet. 
Mr. Runyan played a "major role in redefining this genre," the design historian Philip B. Meggs said in "A History of Graphic Design."
He did this by creating a format that combined the editorial pacing of a magazine and the typographic and pictorial elegance of an art book. The Litton report was the first to contain distinctive graphics and modern still-life photographs of antique scientific artifacts, providing what Mr. Runyan called "symbiology," and illustrating a narrative about the young company, which was founded in 1954, and its relationship to the broader history of science. Mr. Runyan viewed the annual report as a tool to build faith and confidence among the employees and stockholders as well as to symbolize the company's overall mission.
Crosby Kelly, Litton's former manager of investor relations, said at the time that this annual report was "something like a flag," useful in bolstering morale. 
Mr. Runyan's work was among the first to present " 'the big picture,' the major social and economic trends of the times -- and then show how the individual company fits within this framework," said a 1971 article in Graphis, a design trade magazine. The report won numerous professional awards and accolades and brought Mr. Runyan hundreds of other commissions. His concept remains the standard in the graphic design field to this day. 
Robert Miles Runyan was born in Falls City, Neb., on April 18, 1925. He joined the Marine Corps in 1943 and later attended both the Art Center and Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles. In 1956, he established Robert Miles Runyan & Associates in Playa del Rey, Calif., initially designing advertisements and record covers. His first corporate assignment was for Litton, which was then an obscure Beverly Hills military contractor. Within a short time, he was in great demand for design typified by abstract iconography and crisp typography. During a single year his firm produced 48 annual reports. 
But despite a list of international clients that he worked for developing logos, identities and packages -- including Transamerica, Times Mirror, Mattel, Vuarnet of France, Unibanco of Mexico, the Los Angeles Rams, Rockwell International, and Caesar's Palace -- Mr. Runyan did not fit the stereotype of a company man. His version of the three-piece business suit was a tight-fitting cowboy shirt, stove-pipe jeans and lizard-skin Western boots, worn with a brush of a mustache that made him look like the Marlboro Man.
Both his office and his Victorian-style home were stuffed with his countless Americana collectibles, ranging from more than a dozen illuminated, working gas pumps to two hundred "Do Not Disturb" door-knob signs. Some of his collection turned up in his designs.
For the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, Mr. Runyan was given what he considered the chance of a lifetime, the opportunity to compete for the commission to design the official symbol. After 3,500 sketches he devised the "Stars in Motion" logo that appeared on everything sold at the games. Of this project, he said: "What I achieved can never be taken away. I'm etched in history."
Mr. Runyan is survived by his wife, Claudette; two daughters, Tevis, of Hartford, and Kimberly, of Playa del Rey; and a grandson.

HEADLINE: Now Playing In Clubland: Hard Times; 
Night Spots Confront Residential Growth And Higher Rents

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO 

 BODY:
When Wetlands, a TriBeCa club famous for fostering the careers of quirky bands, announced this week that it was closing, music fans were devastated, but those in the industry were hardly surprised.
 The building on Hudson Street that houses the club was sold to a group that wants to convert the space into apartments, and Wetlands and its late-night revelers didn't exactly fit into its plans. 
 To club owners, it is a familiar situation. They say it has become harder for nightclubs to survive in New York because of steeply rising rents and changes in zoning that have allowed residents to move into areas that used to be the preserve of industry and business.
With residential neighbors abhorring the same things clubs covet -- crowds, traffic, noise -- and with community boards exerting considerable influence on state and city licensing agencies these days, many areas of the city, especially downtown, are now virtually off limits. Other areas are willing to accept only clubs that open in existing nightclub space, owners say. 
"This is the toughest atmosphere for nightclubs in New York since Prohibition," said Robert Bookman, the lawyer for the New York Nightlife Association, a group representing about 100 nightclubs.
The city's Department of Consumer Affairs, which issues cabaret licenses, says that 319 establishments hold licenses this year, including nightclubs, strip clubs and other businesses with dancing, like restaurants, down from 333 last year.
Club owners say what is more telling is that fewer businesses even make it to the licensing stage because of the difficulties of finding a location. They note that the number of clubs remained virtually flat in recent years while the city itself was in a long period of economic growth.
But if the nightclub industry is looking for sympathy, it will be hard pressed to find any in the city, where quality-of-life issues became one of the hallmarks of the Giuliani administration.
The association of nightclubs said business became trickier in the early 1990's, when new city and state legislation made it harder for a club to obtain a cabaret license for dancing or a state liquor license. One law has also empowered the local community boards to reject a club that wants to open within 500 feet of three existing businesses that serve liquor.
"Residents and clubs just don't mix," said Madelyn Wils, the chairwoman of Community Board 1 in Lower Manhattan, which has successfully fought the openings of clubs. "Nine out of 10 times there are problems."
The Copacabana, the granddaddy of dance clubs in the city, exemplifies the struggle that club owners say is driving some of them away or out of business. In many ways, the Copacabana is in a category of its own. It has operated since 1940 (with a three-year hiatus in the 1970's after its original owner died) in a business where 5 to 10 years is considered a healthy life span. And it has served up the same music for the past 20 years -- salsa and merengue -- in an industry that caters to the latest fad.
But this year, the Copa became just another club pitted against the realities of the city's real estate market. Its rather unglamorous neighborhood of car dealerships and parking lots near the Hudson River suddenly became more economically desirable. So after nine years on a block of low buildings on West 57th Street, the club was forced to move out last month to make way for two new office towers.
John Juliano, who owns the Copa with two partners, said the search for a new home started about a year and a half ago after he was notified by the property's new landlord that the club's 10-year lease would be terminated early. The owners looked at more than 50 locations in spaces ranging from parking lots to the former Studio 54, which was tied up with the musical "Cabaret."
The search was restricted not only by residential encroachment, but also by the club's needs. The owners wanted at least 25,000 square feet. After holding 10-year leases at two previous locations, this time they wanted a lease no shorter than 25 years. They settled for a 47,000-square-foot building at 570 West 34th Street, near 11th Avenue, that used to house offices. The Copacabana will reopen at the new site next summer. In the meantime, it has moved its live music to another club, Ohm, on West 22nd Street, four nights a week.
"It's been a nightmare," said Glee Ballard, the Copa's general manager. "The biggest problem is that you have to go to an area available for a cabaret and a liquor license and then you want a wide open space." She said that the new spot, at a rent at least five times as high as the old site's, is in an industrial area where the club "can't annoy anybody."
"There's no such thing as going to prestigious neighborhoods," she said. "You can go there with a McDonald's or a big department store, but clubs, no. Everybody acts as if entertainment is not desirable."
Deputy Police Commissioner Thomas Antenen, the department's chief spokesman, said both the police and residents had become less tolerant of problems associated with clubs. "It's not so much what happens in the clubs," he said, "but the stuff that happens in the immediate areas: fights, people hanging out, making noise, maybe drinking."
Marty Arret, owner of the Latin Quarter on the Upper West Side, said that in his neighborhood, gentrification had drawn neighbors who opposed his club. The club, at one time known as Club Broadway, has a mostly Hispanic clientele and has been at the same spot for 20 years.
"They call us and say, 'Why don't you go to the Bronx?' " he said.
As it turns out, the Latin Quarter is shutting down on Aug. 31; its landlord decided to rent the space, on Broadway near West 96th Street, to a bank. Mr. Arret said he was looking for a new location but had found that most available places were going for at least double his current monthly rent of $25,000.
David Rabin, who is the president of the New York Nightlife Association and an owner of Lotus, a supper club, said it took him three years to find a site for the club. Lotus opened about two years ago in a former strip club on West 14th Street, in the meatpacking district in Manhattan. Since then, he said, rents per square foot have more than tripled in what used to be "a block full of prostitutes and meatpackers."
Mr. Rabin said he spent $5,000 a week on security and faced constant police inspections. He said he was pursuing his next business deal in Las Vegas.
Kathryn E. Freed, a city councilwoman who represents Lower Manhattan and has been a plaintiff in court cases against several clubs, played down the clubs' concerns. She said clubs and residential neighbors coexisted peacefully in many parts of the city, usually because the clubs had made an effort to minimize any disturbance to the neighborhood. "Night life doesn't have to be disruptive," she said.
Ms. Freed said there was still room for improvement. She said she favored tightening noise regulations and requiring waiting areas inside the clubs to eliminate the velvet rope crowds outside.
Neighbors like Ms. Wils say noise is not the only problem; they cite alcohol, drugs, lewd behavior and sometimes even shootings outside the clubs. In New York, as in other areas of the country, the rising popularity of Ecstasy and other illegal drugs has drawn a police crackdown.
Police officials said that in the past year and a half they had sought to close at least five major clubs for allowing the sale and use of so-called designer drugs on and around their premises. George A. Grasso, deputy police commissioner for legal matters, called the problem a continuing concern, but said it was not necessarily worse than in past years.
Club owners concede there are bad apples among them, but say the clubs need more police presence. In 1999, the nightclub association asked to hire off-duty uniformed police officers, as clubs do in other cities, but the Police Department declined. In a letter to the group, the department said the proposal was not "legally permissible" and could expose the city to "substantial additional risk of civil liability."
Mr. Bookman, the lawyer for the nightclub association, said the city's world-famous reputation for night life was bound to erode unless zoning variances were reined in, the police helped out and there was "respect for the industry as a taxpaying industry." According to a study by the night life association, the industry funnels close to $3 billion a year into the city's economy.
Mr. Juliano at the Copa said he regretted not having bought a building years ago. Now, he said, it would take $10 million to buy one and $5 million to renovate it.
Even for the Copa, that is out of the question, he said. "Just don't have the money."

HEADLINE: In U.S. Illegally, Immigrants Get License to Drive 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: GARNER, N.C., Aug. 1 

 BODY:
The roofer climbed down from the scaffolding around the new strip mall, pulled out his wallet, and fondled the little plastic card inside as if it were enchanted. Though he does not speak English, he was delighted to point to the words on the card: "State of North Carolina Driver License," and underneath, his name, Alejandro.
 "I used to have a Mexican license, which the police didn't like," he said through an interpreter, declining to give his last name because he is in this country illegally. "But here in North Carolina they said I could have this, a real license, and I couldn't believe it. Now I get insurance, and I don't have to worry so much when I get in the car." 
 Three other workers on the same job site in this suburb south of Raleigh said they also had licenses despite their illegal status, and said they get paid as much as $2 an hour more because of the extra versatility the license gives them on the job. 
For these and hundreds of thousands of other illegal immigrants who have taken advantage of North Carolina's liberal rules for a license, driving is no longer a furtive affair, conducted under cover of night and only when absolutely necessary. Their card and the sense of identity it confers allows them at least a partial entry into the mainstream of the United States, a sense of security above the underground of menial jobs and makeshift communities.
The validation conferred by a license, of course, is precisely why most states do not provide them to immigrants in the country illegally, out of concern that it would induce more people to cross the border in violation of national law. Only three other states -- Tennessee, Utah and Virginia -- give licenses to any state resident who can pass the driving test, regardless of their legal status. Other states, including Illinois and New Mexico, have considered the possibility, weighing North Carolina's argument that the licensing and testing process will improve highway safety and see to it that more drivers have insurance.
"In 9 out of 10 cases, people who move here for jobs and opportunities are going to drive, whether they have a license or not," said Wayne J. Hurder, North Carolina's director of driver's license certification. "We think it's in the best interests of everyone in the state if we can get them to learn the laws of the road and get insurance. It's not our job to get into national immigration policy -- this is a purely practical decision."
But that argument, which has been made most vociferously by President Vicente Fox of Mexico, has failed to persuade many of the largest states, where benefits to immigrants remain a touchy emotional and political issue, rather than a matter of practical policy. Even in some states that have begun to extend some benefits, like in-state college tuition, a driver's license is still considered a touchstone of citizenship that remains jealously guarded.
Officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service say they are not happy with licensing procedures like North Carolina's, but that there is nothing they can do about it.
Tennessee's decision in May to grant licenses to illegal immigrants may be an indication of their increasing acceptance in society, and the legislatures in California and Texas have also approved such measures in the last year. But the governors in the two states, a Democrat and a Republican respectively, vetoed the bills, and some states, including Georgia, Minnesota and South Carolina, have moved to tighten restrictions, making licenses far more difficult to obtain for those who cannot document their legal status.
"These are criminals, who slip stealthily and evasively into this country and remain here as fugitives, and I don't think we should reward that kind of behavior with the privilege to drive," said John Graham Altman III, a Republican member of the South Carolina House of Representatives. "North Carolina obviously isn't serious about observing the law, but I think if you encourage the invasion of the illegals, you'll just get more of them."
Earlier this year, Mr. Altman introduced a bill that would ban licenses for illegal immigrants, making explicit a policy already followed by the state. The measure passed the House but was not taken up by the Senate. Independent of that effort, the state motor vehicles division recently decided to require applicants to produce either a Social Security card or a letter from the Social Security Administration stating that the applicant is in the country legally.
North Carolina asks for a Social Security number to comply with a federal law seeking people who do not pay child support, but if an applicant does not have one, the state accepts other identification, including a Mexican military I.D. card and voter registration cards from other countries. In May, Gov. Don Sundquist of Tennessee, a Republican, signed into law a similar policy, producing waiting lines so long that some legislators wanted to repeal the measure. (The lines have since returned to a manageable size.)
The divergence in the states' policies can easily be seen in the waiting rooms of their motor vehicles offices. In North Carolina and Tennessee, branch offices are full of people speaking Spanish, and many can barely keep the Spanish translations of their driving manuals in stock. In South Carolina offices, there is far less Spanish to be heard, and many immigrants say they want nothing to do with the licensing bureaucracy.
"If you go in there and speak Spanish, they give you a big hassle and want to see all kinds of proof," said a welder from Mexico in Spartanburg, S.C., who crossed over illegally. "So we just drive anyway, and stay under the speed limit and hope no one stops us." He added that he had no auto insurance.
North Carolina immigrants, on the other hand, can not only get insurance, but many who were fearful of driving without a license are free from the dependence those who could drive, particularly in an area with almost no public transit. 
"My brothers used to take me places, and a friend of mine drove me to work every day," said a woman from El Salvador who repairs uniforms at a rental company and who got her license in Cary, another Raleigh suburb. "It was bad when I had to wait outside in the cold for a ride. But now I can go anywhere by myself."
The Legislature never formally approved the state's policy, but it began to evolve in the late 1980's when immigrants began arriving in the state in large numbers. Today the state has the nation's fastest-growing Hispanic population, and businesses are eager to see their work force licensed and insured.
Since 1997, Mr. Hurder said, the state has issued more than 400,000 licenses and ID cards to people lacking Social Security numbers, more than 260,000 of whom were Hispanic. Officials say they believe the policy has reduced the number of fake ID's and Social Security numbers often used elsewhere by immigrants.
Some of those, he acknowledged, were not North Carolina residents. The state's policy has become well-known among immigrants across the country, and people from Florida, South Carolina and the northeast have flocked to North Carolina to get a license and then return to their home states. A high school student from Huntington, New York, who was born in El Salvador, said he was in the Garner branch office today for precisely that purpose.
"I need a license in New York in case I get stopped," he said. "Back home, lots of people have a North Carolina license."
To restrict that practice, a bill is now under consideration in the State Legislature to require license applicants to show proof that they are North Carolina residents, which could be a pay stub or a utility bill. But legislators say they do not plan to require applicants to be legal United States residents.
"The ability to drive is very helpful to our newest residents in getting their lives established here," said State Senator Wib Gulley, a Democrat from Durham who is chairman of the transportation subcommittee. "They play a crucial role in our economy, which would be severely hurt if we put a wall up around the state."
In recent months, that message has been carried around the country by Dr. Juan Hernandez, appointed by Mr. Fox as the director of the Office of Mexicans Abroad. Dr. Hernandez said in an interview that he had met with about a dozen American governors, urging them to follow North Carolina's lead, but has encountered considerable resistance.
"Politically, they feel it's a very hot issue for them right now," he said. "But what we tell them is, these people did break one law coming here, but they shouldn't be forced to break other laws. These are the people who are building the roads of America, but they're not allowed to drive on them."

HEADLINE: Matters of Law, And Semantics, In Health Bills 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3 

 BODY:
After six years of bitter debate over patients' rights, the House and the Senate have produced bills that seem very similar. But there are big differences, illustrated by two little words, "a" and "the." 
 Both bills would allow patients to sue health insurance plans in some circumstances. To win damages under the Senate bill, a plaintiff must show that a health plan was negligent and that such negligence was "a proximate cause" of personal injury or death. 
 By contrast, under the House bill, passed on Thursday, a plaintiff must show that the insurer's negligence was "the proximate cause" of injury or death. That could be more difficult. 
The delay or denial of care by an insurer might contribute to severe injury or disability. But the insurer could argue that its action was just one of many factors. It could assert, for example, that a patient already had a chronic condition, or that the patient and the doctor were at fault, because they did not supply all the information that was necessary to rule properly on a claim for benefits.
The difference between "a" and "the" exemplifies the biggest difference between the two bills -- a difference that House and Senate negotiators will try to iron out in coming months. The Senate measure would give patients freer access to the courts, with fewer limits on the damages they could recover from H.M.O.'s and insurance companies.
For years, health plans protected themselves against lawsuits by invoking a federal law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as Erisa. But in recent years, judges have pierced the shield provided by that law, ruling that an H.M.O. can be held "vicariously liable" for the negligence of its doctors and nurses, and directly responsible for arranging inadequate care.
Alan D. Bloom, senior vice president and general counsel of Maxicare Health Plans, a managed care company in Los Angeles, said: "The plaintiff bar was finally figuring out how to get around Erisa. This new legislation stops that momentum and probably gives the H.M.O.'s more protection than they are losing."
For example, Mr. Bloom said, the House bill would limit punitive damages, but most states have no such limits.
How "a" became "the" is a mystery.
When Representative Charlie Norwood, Republican of Georgia, and House members from both parties introduced a patients' bill of rights on July 19, it included the exact words of the Senate bill: "a proximate cause."
But in subsequent negotiations between Mr. Norwood and the White House, the language was changed, and it became "the proximate cause."
John E. Stone, a spokesman for Mr. Norwood, said he did not know how or why the change was made. He agreed that the change could make it more difficult for patients to prevail in court.
"It's a very valid point," Mr. Stone said. "If this is a problem, it can be worked out in conference between the House and the Senate."
A White House official deeply involved in the negotiations could not explain the change. "That's not something that ever came up in our discussions with Dr. Norwood," said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The legal liability of H.M.O.'s might seem to be a technical question. But Representative Robert E. Andrews, Democrat of New Jersey, said it had major implications for consumers. 
"If the H.M.O. is the sole cause of your injury, you can recover," Mr. Andrews said. "But if it is one of many causes of your injury, you cannot." 
Even if few cases go to court, the possibility or the threat of lawsuits can have a profound influence on the behavior of health maintenance organizations, prompting them to approve more care and to pay more claims.
President Bush supports the House bill, with its more limited right to sue, and has threatened to veto the Senate version. Of course, he can significantly influence negotiations between the two chambers.
What difference does it make to patients? Assume, for example, that a person with cancer goes to a doctor, who recommends an expensive, potentially life-saving medical treatment. But the H.M.O. refuses to authorize it, on the ground that it has not been recognized as effective in research published in medical journals.
Under the Senate and House bills, a patient could challenge such a decision by asking the health plan to reconsider. If this "internal appeal" fails, the patient could seek review by independent medical experts. If this "external appeal" fails, the patient could go to court. 
Disputes involving a question of medical judgment would go to state court.
Federal courts would resolve disputes over administrative issues: Is the patient actually enrolled in the health plan? Is a specific service covered under the contract? What is the co-payment?
In trying to write a new body of tort law for H.M.O.'s, Congress is wading into a rapidly changing, immensely complex field. The law appears to be evolving in a direction favorable to plaintiffs. So lawyers say that anything Congress does could erode some of the rights patients have won in courts and in state legislatures.
The House bill would create a federal right to sue H.M.O.'s -- a "federal cause of action" -- in state court. Democrats said this would override provisions of state laws adopted by 10 states, including California, New Jersey and Texas.
The House and Senate bills would both allow injured patients to recover unlimited economic damages, primarily to compensate for medical expenses and lost earnings. The House bill sets a $1.5 million limit on payments for noneconomic damages like pain and suffering, with a separate limit of $1.5 million on punitive damages.
The Senate bill would not set any limit on noneconomic damages. It would allow up to $5 million in civil assessments resembling punitive damages in federal court.
The House bill allows states to set damage limits lower than the federal caps, but states could not set higher limits.
Multimillion-dollar jury verdicts for malpractice by doctors, hospitals and other health care providers are not particularly unusual. If Congress expands the right to sue without imposing strict limits on damages, Mr. Bush says, insurance costs will rise, and people will lose coverage. 
But sponsors of the Senate bill strenuously oppose limits on noneconomic damages. Such damages, they say, compensate victims for very real injuries like chronic pain, loss of a body part, paralysis and loss of reproductive capacity.
Moreover, the senators say, limits on noneconomic damages tend to discriminate against women who are homemakers, and against children and elderly people, including nursing home residents, because they do not necessarily lose wages when they suffer incapacitating injuries. 
The campaign for patients' rights, begun as a crusade to end H.M.O. "horror stories," may end in a Congressional conference committee that sounds like a law school seminar on torts and contracts.
The House and the Senate finally agreed this summer on the substantive protections that patients should have. In virtually identical language, they would guarantee that people with insurance have access to emergency care, medical specialists, prescription drugs and other services when needed.
With agreement on these issues, the dispute over H.M.O. liability looms as the biggest unresolved issue.
Republicans deplore the focus on litigation. "It's sue, sue, sue," said Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate Republican leader. "That's not the answer."
But Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, said the rest of the bill would be worthless without a means to enforce it in court. "A right without a remedy is no right at all," Mr. Dingell said.

PERSON: Paul Vallas 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
What for an Encore? Why Not 'the Education Governor'?

BYLINE:  By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
THE serious man wearing the funny red necktie sits in a chair in a sunny downtown office with his hands folded.
 His name is Paul Vallas. And he is wearing his children's tie, which drapes neatly down the center of a crisp white button-down shirt and bears pictures of smiling schoolchildren and an American flag. 
 Mr. Vallas, who looks more like a school principal than a politician, hopes to wear that necktie or one like it all the way to the governor's office in Springfield. He would like to become known as "the education governor." 
This is the same Paul Vallas who was hired six years ago by Mayor Richard M. Daley to turn around Chicago's troubled education system and who subsequently won praise even from critics for a tough, hands-on corporate style that led to raised test scores and the restoration of respect to the city's schools.
He is the same Paul Vallas who resigned as chief executive of the school system in June, then stepped away from the public light.
Now, just two months later, he is back, looking to fill a different set of shoes. He announced for governor this week.
If the idea of leaping from the management of the nation's third-largest school system to the governorship seems unusual, then listen to Mr. Vallas.
"I've been the chief executive for the second-largest governmental institution in the state of Illinois: Chicago public schools," he said. "For the last 10 years, I have balanced multimillion-dollar budgets."
"I've buried 65 children who have been the victims of gang violence in their own communities," he added. "I've had to deal with day-to-day management issues and day-to-day controversies that my opponents could never imagine. I think this well prepares me. It well prepares me to be governor of Illinois."
Besides all that, there is his prior experience as budget director for the City of Chicago, as the city's director of revenue, as executive director of the Illinois Economic and Fiscal Commission.
He likes his chances, as do those in his camp.
"Paul Vallas," said Jay D. Doherty, a political consultant to the Vallas campaign, "is the one Democrat who can win."
Mr. Vallas is banking on his reputation as the man who saved the Chicago schools, and on the media exposure that the effort earned him during the last six years. He hopes that his campaign message -- largely one of spreading across Illinois the education improvements he made here in his hometown -- will translate into votes not only in Chicago but downstate as well.
Not that winning the governor's seat will be easy: no Democrat has done so in nearly three decades. The last was Daniel Walker, back when bellbottom pants were in, along with long sideburns and disco music, and Mr. Vallas was less than half his current age, 48.
Democrats see an opportunity to win next year's election, though, particularly in light of a federal inquiry into bribes paid for commercial driver's licenses. The bribes went to employees in the office of the secretary of state, who was then George Ryan. Mr. Ryan, now the Republican governor, is expected to announce soon whether he will seek a second term. 
In any event, Mr. Vallas must first capture the Democratic nomination next March, against what promises to be a crowded field. He cites a poll showing him second only to a former member of Congress, Glenn Poshard. Mayor Daley so far has not publicly announced his support for any candidate, but even without the mayor's backing, Mr. Vallas says he is confident and up to the challenge. It won't be his first.
When he took over as Chicago schools chief in 1995, the system had a reputation as the nation's worst. He quickly went to work, enacting a zero-tolerance behavior code, imposing a more rigorous curriculum and putting an end to a policy of social promotion. In time, Chicago schools became a national model. 
BORN in Chicago, Mr. Vallas grew up on the city's South Side. He taught school in the 1970's and began his career in public service as a senior policy analyst with the State Legislature.
He and his wife, Sharon, a retired police officer, have three sons.
Earlier this year, Mr. Vallas dismissed public speculation that he was going to run for governor, saying he wanted to concentrate on his job as schools chief.
Then came his resignation, and soon news that he had joined the gubernatorial fray.
Why does he want to do it?
"By becoming governor, I'm going to be able to complete the job that I started at the local level," Mr. Vallas said. "I'm not talking about just completing the job for Chicago. I'm talking about completing the job for all local government and throughout the state of Illinois."
So the Paul Vallas for Governor Web site is up and running, and his campaign offices will open soon, he said energetically in that downtown office today, wearing his funny red necktie.
He thought of another Illinois Democrat, a former senator, and said with a laugh, "If Paul Simon could get elected with his bowtie, I can get elected with my children's tie." 
A campaign consultant standing nearby suggested that he get about 500 of the ties.
After all, it's a long road to Springfield.

HEADLINE: Subsidies for Clean Coal Miss Mark, Critics Say 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Aug. 1 

 BODY:
Compared with many alternatives, a coal-fired power plant being built here will be anything but clean. It will emit several times as much smog-causing pollution and heat-trapping gas as the the same utility's new plant, fired by natural gas, a few miles away.
 But it is the coal-fired plant, not the gas-burning plant, that is being subsidized by the federal government, under a 15-year-old program that has spent $1.8 billion to promote so-called clean-coal technology in 38 projects. That aid would triple under the energy bill passed by the House of Representatives, to $5.3 billion over the next 10 years, including new tax credits. 
 The coal industry and the utilities say the subsidies are necessary to help make coal, the country's dirtiest fuel, but also its cheapest and most abundant one, as clean as possible. But critics say the program has fallen badly off the mark, by paying utilities like the Jacksonville Electric Authority here to install technologies they would probably be adopting on their own and by encouraging the burning of coal over environmentally friendlier alternatives. 
"Basically, there is no such thing as clean coal," said Kate Abend, an energy expert with the United States Public Interest Research Group, which is aligned with environmentalists.
Michael N. Lawson, major projects manager at the Jacksonville plant, said it was going to switch to the new coal-burning technology "whether we had Energy Department money or not." The utility is converting a second 300 megawatt generator at the plant without federal help.
The federal aid -- some $73 million from the Energy Department -- is covering a fourth of the $300 million cost of what will soon become the largest coal-fired power plant in the world to use what is known as circulating fluidized bed technology. The conversion to coal, at the utility's Northside generating station, on a waterway near the Atlantic Ocean, will increase the output of a power plant built in 1972 by 240 percent, while reducing its emissions of the pollutants that cause smog by 10 percent.
The technology, which burns coal at lower temperatures and uses limestone to capture many emissions, is about 50 percent cleaner than the technology used at a typical new coal-burning power plant. The converted Northside plant, with no visible emissions, will be cleaner than a nearby 1980's coal-burning plant, which has visible plumes.
But the converted coal plant will still allow 10 times the emissions of smog-causing nitrogen oxide as generators fueled by natural gas, like the Brandy Branch plant, which the utility opened in Jacksonville this year. The Northside plant will also emit more than twice as much carbon dioxide, which traps heat and contributes to global warming, and considerable sulfur dioxide, an ingredient in smog and acid rain that is not generated by natural gas.
Nor is the technology being installed here state of the art. A process known as coal gasification, being tested at plants in Tampa, Fla., and Terre Haute, Ind., has shown much more promise in reducing emissions of pollutants, including carbon dioxide. The ostensible purpose of the federal financing is to demonstrate clean coal's commercial possibilities, but years of delays have meant that even before the Jacksonville plant begins operating next year, others will have begun installing the technology without federal help.
The federally backed plant will become the latest of 400 fluidized-bed units operating around the world, most built without subsidies.
Walt Bussells, the chief executive of the Jacksonville Electric Authority, the eighth largest utility in the country, said the federal aid was "a deciding factor" in the project. But he said that in proceeding with a coal-fired plant and a gas-fired plant at roughly the same time, the authority was mainly concerned with avoiding the mistakes of the late 1970's, when reliance on one fuel -- oil -- left it vulnerable to soaring prices.
The Northside plant, built to burn oil and gas, is among a handful built or converted to burn coal in the last five years, a period in which utilities embraced the cheaper, cleaner-burning natural gas plants.
But more than half of the country's electricity is still generated by burning coal, and the recent volatility in natural gas prices has prompted some utilities to give coal a second look. In the last six months, plans have been announced for at least 24 new coal-fired plants nationwide, and most analysts expect that trend to accelerate if the Senate approves the new clean-coal subsidies. The details of the Senate version of the bill are still being worked out.
Whether building more coal-fired plants is good is a subject of debate.
The National Mining Association said large subsidies were crucial to an economically and environmentally sound coal industry. The Bush administration, which proposed $2 billion in new money for clean coal, has supported the even larger subsidies approved by the House, on grounds that they are needed to promote diversity in the country's energy supply.
"For the environmental benefits in particular, there's a natural reason to move this thing forward," said Robert S. Kripowicz, acting assistant secretary of energy for fossil fuels and the main overseer of the clean-coal program. "And because of our need for energy, it's important to promote a balance of technologies."
Mr. Kripowicz conceded that the federal clean-coal program had had many setbacks, including project delays and bankruptcies. The General Accounting Office has criticized the program, prompting Congress to take back more than $400 million of the roughly $2.4 billion it appropriated in the late 1980's. The money for the Jacksonville project was approved in the early 1980's, when the project was to be in Tallahassee, Fla.
If the department were making the decision today, Mr. Kripowicz said, it might not have financed what is now a widely used technology. But he pointed out that two-thirds of the cost of federally backed demonstration projects had been borne by industry and the states, and he said the investment had helped coal-burning power plants to cut their emissions since 1970 even as the use of coal to generate electricity had tripled.
Coal is not the only energy industry that would benefit from the House bill. Oil and gas producers would be exempted from certain royalty payments to the government and eligible for a variety of tax credits; so would investors in nuclear energy.
But most analysts see the coal industry as the biggest winner. It would benefit not only from the $2 billion to promote clean-coal technology over the next 10 years, but also from $3.3 billion in investment and tax credits to encourage the use of coal to generate electricity, subject to certain performance standards. That has caused resentment among advocates of natural gas, who believe the government should more actively embrace their cleaner technology.
Under the House measure, most of the $2 billion in development financing would be reserved for technologies that convert coal to a gas before burning it for electricity. These processes have already shown more success than other approaches in reducing emissions of pollutants that cause smog.
Coal gasification is also seen as the most promising technology for capturing carbon dioxide, which scientists regard as a major contributor to global warming, but which is not being reduced under existing pollution controls.
People who have studied the bill, however, say the standards of eligibility for the tax credits could include coal-burning generators no cleaner than many existing ones. Environmentalists who believe the industry should be driven toward cleaner technologies by regulation rather than subsidies particularly object to tax credits, saying they will give coal an advantage over wind and water power and other clean, renewable ways to generate electricity.
"The net result is that this would put coal back in a position where it would outcompete the better environmental performers in the marketplace," said David G. Hawkins, a former senior official at the Environmental Protection Agency who now works for the Natural Resources Defense Council. "It would make the situation worse by expanding the taxpayer subsidies for the world's dirtiest fuel."
But David Parham, chief executive of Foster Wheeler, a principal manufacturer of coal-burning systems and a beneficiary of the subsidies, argued that major federal aid made sense.
"Of course, gas is a cleaner fuel to burn than coal," Mr. Parham said. "But we need a balanced approach to generating electricity, and coal is still our biggest energy resource."

HEADLINE: Legislature Is Assailed By Pataki Over Budget 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 3 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki traveled the state today to attack the Legislature for passing a bare-bones budget over his objections and vowed the move would not coerce him into spending more than he originally proposed.
 "This is a thin attempt to try to force me to pass a budget that spends billions more than the state can afford," he said at a news conference in Niagara Falls. "It's not going to happen." 
 The governor did not move to block the budget in court, even though he said that he still thought that aspects of the budget were unconstitutional and that he was considering a lawsuit or a veto. 
The state comptroller, meanwhile, said the budget would keep the government running for the rest of the fiscal year, despite being full of painful cuts. The comptroller's decision meant the Pataki administration had to release paychecks to lawmakers that were being held until a budget was passed under a 1998 law.
As the dust settled from the parliamentary battle late Thursday night, the Republican governor appeared to be mounting a political rather than a legal challenge to the Legislature, trying in news conferences across the state to shift blame for the lean budget to legislative leaders. 
The Democrat-led Assembly and the Republican-led Senate overcame partisan differences to pass the stripped-down plan in a last-ditch effort to compel the governor to talk about adding some spending to his budget. For months, Mr. Pataki has said the state cannot afford to spend more than the $83.6 billion he proposed in January because of the shaky national economy.
Michael McKeon, the governor's chief spokesman, said, "The governor's going to make it clear to the people of this state in every corner of this state that he stands against the Albany insiders who want to spend more than the people can afford." 
The comptroller, H. Carl McCall, a Democrat who is planning to run for governor next year, said the $79.6 billion spending plan the Legislature passed was "not a good budget" but laid the blame squarely at Mr. Pataki's feet. He said the governor had avoided Albany and failed to broker a deal with lawmakers.
The budget essentially holds spending at last year's levels or lower in most state programs, except for a $382 million increase in school aid. It cuts about $4 billion from the governor's proposed budget, including several large blocks of money used for economic development and welfare programs. Legislative leaders are betting it will inflict so much pain on local governments that political pressure will mount on the governor to negotiate a supplemental budget that will include some of the lawmakers' priorities.
There is no question that the budget will make it difficult for Mr. Pataki to govern. Dozens of social service programs, from Medicaid payments to day care for the working poor, are facing a $1.5 billion shortfall this year unless an ancillary budget is passed, the governor's budget office said. 
But the Legislature also eliminated a number of large funds dear to Mr. Pataki over which it has little control. Among them is a $150 million fund for conserving wilderness, a $1.5 billion fund of unspent federal welfare money that can be used for social programs and more than $300 million in economic development grants. 
Mr. Pataki began the day with a fishing exhibition in Syracuse and then held news conferences in Rochester and Buffalo before returning to Albany late in the day to speak to reporters. All day, he hammered away at the Legislature for passing what he said was a budget full of holes that would cause many programs to run out of money. He also chastised lawmakers for taking a vacation before finishing the job.
Lawmakers, however, countered that it was the governor who had avoided working out a compromise while traveling around the state and country for ribbon-cuttings, fund-raisers and other minor announcements.
"Instead of hiding from his responsibilities, it would be helpful to the people he was elected to serve if he stayed in Albany negotiating a budget with the Senate and Assembly," Charles Carrier, a spokesman for the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said of the governor.
Underlying the struggle over the budget is a larger constitutional fight over which branch of government shapes the state's spending. The constitution gives the governor enormous sway over spending. The Legislature must act on his budget bills before proposing its own. Lawmakers also can only strike out an appropriation, reduce it or add extra money in a separate bill. The governor can veto any additions.

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 The home furnishings maker and seller Ethan Allen Interiors said yesterday that its fiscal fourth-quarter profits fell by a third, meeting its lowered estimate, but it also warned that sales and earnings in its first financial quarter would be lower than expected, because of softer economic activity. The retailer, which sells its furnishings through a network of 312 retail locations, said its net income for the fourth quarter ended June 30, excluding a $6.9 million restructuring and impairment charge, was $20.1 million, or 50 cents a diluted share. Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call had expected the company, based in Danbury, Conn., to post a profit in the range of 40 to 50 cents, with a mean estimate of 46 cents a share.

HEADLINE: Lack of Advertising Forces Theglobe.comto Shut Web Sites 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Theglobe.com, whose meteoric rise in its first day of trading helped fuel the frenzy for initial public offerings from Internet companies, announced yesterday that it planned to shut most of its Web operations. 
 The closings will cost 60 employees their jobs -- about half its work force -- and all but bring to an end one of the most closely watched Internet companies in Silicon Alley in Manhattan. The company plans to shut all its community Web sites, which were aimed at young adults, and many of those that offer games by Aug. 15, officials said. The sites include www.theglobe.com and www.webjump.com. 
 Chuck Peck, the chief executive of Theglobe.com, said yesterday that the company's troubles could be attributed to an online advertising market that "remains severely depressed, and there are few signs of a rebound in the near-term."
Mr. Peck said the company, which never reported a profit, was exploring the possibilities of being acquired by another company and selling its game properties.
On Nov. 12, 1998, Theglobe's stock was first offered at $4.50 a share. The price soared to $97 that day before closing at $63.50, making it the most successful public offering of stock ever. Theglobe was the first rising dot-com to go public in the aftermath of the stock downturn that followed the Asian economic crisis.
The stock's rise was influenced in part by the story of its youthful founders, Todd Krizelman and Stephan Paternot, friends who started the company together in a Cornell University dormitory room and then became overnight millionaires at age 24.
They put their first Web site online in April 1995 after they raised $15,000 from family and friends to buy equipment.
But by January 2000, with the dot-com bubble beginning to show slight cracks, Theglobe.com's quarterly losses were widening and its stock price had dropped to about $9. That month, Mr. Paternot and Mr. Krizelman, who served as co-chief executives, stepped down.
The company's stock rose less than a cent, to 13.5 cents, yesterday.

HEADLINE: Hevesi Is Pledging Efficiency And a Style That Won't Hurt 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, said yesterday that if he were elected mayor he would offer New Yorkers "the best of Rudy Giuliani without the worst."
 Mr. Hevesi said that as mayor he would work to continue the current administration's success in driving crime down, but would work to curb police misconduct at the same time. He pledged to improve the school system with smaller class sizes, saying that public education has been neglected for too long. And he said that he would use city money to create a trust fund to build more affordable housing. 
 "I intend, as mayor, to offer what's the best of Rudy Giuliani without the worst, to govern in a way that's very positive, as he has in some respects, and to abandon or reject some of the style or decisions that he has made that have been hurtful to the people of this city," he said. 
In a 90-minute interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times, Mr. Hevesi cast himself as someone who could deliver the best of both worlds: a strong, efficient government that he said would be more sensitive and open. He spoke of fostering better relationships between City Hall and black and Hispanic residents, of forming a government that "looks like the city," of building consensus on issues like education.
He outlined a series of proposals, some of which could prove costly. He called for a "substantial increase" in schools spending, but did not say how much. He said that police officers deserved a "substantial raise" -- much more, he said, than the raise that the city recently agreed to pay other uniformed workers (10 percent over two and a half years). He said that he would set aside roughly $150 million a year into a fund to build affordable housing. And he said he would establish 200 storefront computer training centers to teach job skills. 
But Mr. Hevesi acknowledged that the worsening economy and anticipated budget gaps in the coming years might make some of his proposals difficult to put in effect. "If that happens, we will have austerity budgets, and we better have a mayor who knows how to handle those budgets," Mr. Hevesi said.
He said he favored some business tax cuts if they could be demonstrably linked to job growth. But he added that, if necessary, he would consider reinstating an income-tax surcharge to pay for his education proposals. And he said that he could not rule out further tax increases if the economy soured. "You never rule out anything," he said. "Anybody who rules it out is not telling you the truth."
Mr. Hevesi, 61, the comptroller for the past seven and a half years, said that he possessed a variety of skills that made him suited to be mayor. 
He said that his 22 years as a state assemblyman left him with an understanding of the legislative process and a good working relationship with state officials whose support is crucial to the city. In his current post, he said, he has not only managed a staff of 800 but has also been a "manager of the managers," since his staff audits all the other city agencies to look for waste. And he said that his experience as an educator -- he has taught political science at Queens College and Columbia University -- would guide his school policy. 
The extent to which Rudolph W. Giuliani continues to loom over the race to replace him was reflected in the amount of time Mr. Hevesi devoted to discussing the current mayor. Mr. Hevesi, a Democrat, found much to praise about Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, saying that the mayor "shattered the myth that you can't govern New York," made the city much safer, improved its image and drew large numbers of tourists back.
But Mr. Hevesi also found much to criticize, saying that Mr. Giuliani had not done nearly enough to improve the city's public schools, that he had been "in denial" about the problem of police misconduct and that he had alienated many people with his combative governing style. 
By contrast, he hardly mentioned the three rivals he will face on Sept. 11 in the Democratic primary: Public Advocate Mark Green; the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone; and the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer. Mr. Hevesi did single out Mr. Vallone, a fellow moderate who is also from Queens, for some criticism, questioning at one point how Mr. Vallone would pay for his education plan. 
And, without mentioning him by name, Mr. Hevesi criticized Mr. Ferrer for his campaign pledge to represent "the other New York," which Mr. Ferrer defines as the people left behind in the last economic boom. Mr. Hevesi said that he believed "this is one city and that it is not helpful -- that it is divisive -- to define it as something else, as two cities."
On education, the issue that he has defined as his first priority, Mr. Hevesi staked out different positions from some of his rivals. He said that he did not favor abolishing the Board of Education, for example, but would prefer to see it restructured and expanded so its members would be required to have backgrounds in education and management. "They wouldn't be the mayor's friend or crony or deputy mayor," he said. 
He said that he would explore lengthening the school day and the school year to help deal with the current overcrowding problems. 
Mr. Hevesi also said that he approved of the job done by Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, whose background is in business. But he would not say whether he would support keeping Mr. Levy on if he were elected mayor. And unlike some of his rivals, he added that he did not believe that a background in education should be a prerequisite for the chancellor's post. "I think a lot of what a chancellor has to do is management," he said. "Maybe the second in command is the educator." 
And Mr. Hevesi offered conciliatory words for the teachers' union, which has become a frequent target of politicians in recent years, and whose endorsement he is seeking. He said he thought the union, the United Federation of Teachers, should be included in efforts to reform the system and said that people who try to "demonize" the union were seeking a simplistic answer to a complex problem. He said that teachers should be paid more, but added that he would push to speed up the disciplinary process used to remove poor teachers. 
But, in the interview, he said that he would try to revamp poorly performing schools by consulting with nearly every "stake-holder" in the field -- calling on teachers, parents, administrators, legislators, the construction industry and others to map out a plan, and set a timetable for improvements. 
If the economy should slow further, Mr. Hevesi said, he would try to exempt the schools, along with the police and the Fire Department, from budget cuts. But he declined to say which areas he would cut, saying that it was "completely theoretical."
To build more affordable housing, Mr. Hevesi, like some of the other candidates, suggested setting aside the $100 million the city is expected to collect each year in real estate taxes now that the World Trade Center has been sold to a private developer. He said that he would add to that the roughly $50 million the city collects each year in profits from Battery Park City -- money that was always supposed to have been used to build affordable housing but which has more often simply gone into the general fund.
Still, Mr. Hevesi acknowledged that his proposals could change if the economy weakened. "I don't want to suggest that we're going into recession, because I'm not sure that we are," he said. "I think we have to be cautious."
To try to foster job growth, Mr. Hevesi said, he would support the creation of an Office of Science and Technology to help keep Internet companies in the city by helping them find investors and deal with logistical problems. And he suggested that the city should do more to encourage the growing film industry, by helping build more sound stages so that the productions that currently film on location here would be able to stay to film their interior shots.
Mr. Hevesi rejected the suggestion that, as comptroller, he was not critical of Mayor Giuliani, proudly describing their battles over bond refinancing and the city's watershed.
And he said that he would work hard to improve the relations between City Hall and the city's culturally diverse communities. 
"I think the mayor has to have a warm, trusting relationship with the leadership of every ethnic community, starting with the African-American and Latino communities in their diversity," he said. "And that's hard work, that's reaching out, that's hiring the best people from their communities into government so the government looks like the city. And that's an enormous talent bank that's been ignored by the mayor."

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Ready for Brazil and Argentina Rescues 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund said today that it was prepared to lend $15 billion to Brazil and speed financial aid for Argentina as concerns rose that the two nations' financial problems had worsened and begun to spread through Latin America.
 The long-term aid packages announced this afternoon came with the blessing of the Bush administration, which has supported several large financial rescues even though administration officials have often said they intend to avoid international bailouts like those arranged in the Clinton administration. 
 Troubles in Argentina, Brazil and another recent aid recipient, Turkey, are reminiscent of the financial contagion that spread throughout the developing world in the late 1990's. 
Although some economists say the situation is less serious this time, emerging markets are finding it difficult to stoke growth through exports or attract high levels of foreign investment, with the United States, Europe and Japan all suffering slow growth or outright recession. 
Officials of the monetary fund and the Bush administration have said they are especially wary about the continued slide of Argentina, which received hefty multilateral loans that totaled $13.7 billion late last year but has failed to break out of a three-year-old recession. Investors are worried that Buenos Aires will default on its $128 billion debt.
Neighboring Brazil, though by most measures economically healthier, has seen its currency, the real, fall sharply against the dollar, making its sizable foreign debt harder to repay and leading the central bank to raise interest rates.
The managing director of the I.M.F., Horst Kohler, said the fund was ready to accelerate $1.2 billion in aid to Argentina. The money was already included in the earlier aid package, but by changing the terms of the package and speeding up the loan, the fund and the United States effectively acknowledge that the situation there has deteriorated.
The commitment to provide the $15 billion line of credit to Brazil, a surprise, represents the second time in three years that Brazil has successfully appealed for a multi-year emergency program. Mr. Kohler said Brazil could begin receiving loans next month, with the first installment totaling $4.6 billion.
The monetary fund organized a $41 billion rescue package for Brazil in late 1998. Until recently, that program had been viewed as a success, and it had been scheduled to end this year. But a team of Brazilian economic officials has been in Washington for more than a week meeting with officials from the monetary fund, the World Bank and the United States Treasury Department to discuss ways to extend the program.
Administration officials appeared to be fully supporting the new packages. President Bush discussed Latin American problems today with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain, the White House said. The administration sent Treasury Under Secretary John Taylor to Buenos Aires for consultations.
In a statement late today, Mr. Taylor called his talks fruitful and detailed. "I was happy to hear that the I.M.F. has recommended an accelerated disbursement to Argentina," he said.
As recently as last month, however, administration officials had expressed reluctance to provide more aid. Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, said Argentina needed to take steps domestically to improve its economy, viewed at the time as a rejection of the requests for fresh loans.
The Brazil package is the largest single emergency aid plan approved in the Bush administration. It may help restore investor confidence there when markets reopen on Monday. Such multilateral aid is intended to instill faith that the country will not default on its foreign debt, and officials obviously hope that sentiment will change so that Brazil will not be forced to draw on the aid.
"The Brazilian authorities are strengthening fiscal and monetary policies and implementing their structural reform agenda in the face of a difficult external environment," Mr. Kohler said.
Argentina's problems are more entrenched. It has not adhered fully to the terms of the aid package that it received late last year, and it shows few signs of being able to meet its commitments, including a promise to eliminate its budget deficit. But the pressure to continue lending is intense, in part because of the threat that a sudden default would send shock waves through Brazil and other neighbors.
Argentina has pushed the fund to provide an additional $6 billion in loans. It received just a pledge to speed up the committed loans. That violates an unwritten rule of international bailouts, that they are of limited use unless they give the markets a pleasant surprise.
While the aid package was smaller than Argentina had wanted, the White House said Mr. Bush endorsed the Argentine government's austerity programs, calling it the best way to stabilize the nation's economy.

HEADLINE: SENATE APPROVES FARM SUBSIDY BILL PRESIDENT BACKED 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3 

 BODY:
The Senate's Democratic leaders bowed to a White House veto threat today and approved a farm-aid bill that contained $2 billion less than Democrats wanted, offering a preview of the far more divisive budget battles expected this fall.
 The struggle over the agriculture bill turned bitter in its final hours, with Democrats accusing the White House of abandoning farmers who have been hit hard by a drop in commodities prices. 
 Democrats said they had little choice but to approve a Republican $5.5 billion farm bill -- rather than the $7.5 billion Democratic bill that Mr. Bush had threatened to veto -- after they lost a procedural vote that would have allowed quick passage of the more generous subsidy plan. 
"The gun was held to our heads and the White House refused to compromise," said Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who heads the Senate Agriculture Committee.
President Bush welcomed the Senate's voice vote to approve the $5.5 billion bill as "a victory for our nation's farmers at a time when they need it the most."
The impasse had threatened to delay the Senate's traditional August recess, which will now begin as schedule on Saturday; the House began its recess on Thursday. As members of Congress jammed airports and train stations to begin their summer break, Mr. Bush made final preparations for his departure this weekend for an extended vacation at his ranch in Crawford, Tex.
The president and members of Congress will now have about a month to rest up before returning to the capital for what is expected to be one of the most rancorous budget debates in several years.
Later this month, government analysts are expected to release projections showing that the federal budget surplus will be much smaller than they had forecast only weeks ago.
The projections are expected to attribute the decline in the surplus to the faltering economy and to the $1.3 trillion tax-cut package that Mr. Bush pushed through Congress this spring.
The new findings would leave Congress and the White House haggling for months about a variety of unpalatable options -- from cuts in popular government programs, to raids on the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, to a drastic rethinking of Mr. Bush's plans to increase spending at the Pentagon.
"Lady luck seems to have taken a hike," said Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia. Mr. Byrd, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, warned today of the possibility of a "13-car pileup" in the budget process this fall. 
"Because of the flashy tax cut and a sluggish economy, we are poised to spend the Medicare surpluses, disrupt our debt-retirement efforts and dive right back into the deficit doldrums," Mr. Byrd said on the Senate floor.
Joyous over other legislative triumphs this week in House votes on patients' rights and energy policy, the White House suggested that today's Senate vote on the farm bill was a sign that fiscal discipline might be taking hold in Washington at Mr. Bush's prodding, and that a balanced budget remained in reach.
The White House and Republican supporters of the agriculture bill said there was no need for larger subsidies because some livestock and crop prices had increased in recent months, easing what had been a crisis for many farmers.
"I praise the Senate for agreeing to the House bill and look forward to signing this helpful measure into law," Mr. Bush said.
There were no similar words of praise for the president from Senate Democratic leaders, who appeared startled by Mr. Bush's recent string of victories on Capitol Hill after several weeks in which the president seemed disengaged from major policy issues before Congress.
The Senate debate today over the $2 billion difference between the rival agriculture bills gave a hint of the struggles -- and the rhetorical venom -- to come.
While conceding defeat on the issue for now, Democrats said that the White House's refusal to support $2 billion more in farm aid was proof of the Bush administration's cold-heartedness.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, said he would fight to find the extra money for farmers when the Senate returns next month, despite the veto threats. He described Mr. Bush as willing to expand government programs only so long as they benefited his wealthy corporate supporters.
"If it's an oil company, he'll spend money," Mr. Daschle said. "But when you want to give additional money for agriculture or when you fight for additional resources for education, the president says there's nothing there, we can't commit the resources. Well, that dichotomy is one that's not lost on the American people."
Senator Harkin said the bill that was passed today, which originated in the Republican-controlled House, was "totally inadequate to meet the needs of our farmers across the country." He said the White House was willing to provide farmers with "just enough to keep them in the basement."
Though the subsidies in the bill were labeled as emergency aid, they have in fact become routine in the five years since Congress passed legislation that was intended to end farm subsidy programs that date to the 1930's and 1940's.
Ending the subsidies has proved impossible in the face of intense pressure from lobbyists for farmers and agribusiness companies.
And so each year, Congress approves a bill offering "emergency" aid to farmers: $7.1 billion last year, $8.6 billion in 1999 and $5.7 billion in 1998. This year's aid level, $5.5 billion, is about a fifth smaller than last year's, which Republicans said was appropriate given the recent increase in some farm prices.
"Obviously we've had good livestock prices across the board, milk prices have been fairly good recently and even on the grains, we've seen some slight increase in prices," Ann M. Veneman, the secretary of agriculture, said. "I would say there's some easing of the downturn."

HEADLINE: A Focus on Management as the City Heads Into an Unsure Economic Future 

 BODY:
 Following are excerpts from an interview yesterday with Alan G. Hevesi, the comptroller and a Democratic candidate for mayor. The interview was conducted by editors and reporters of The New York Times, and it was the last in a series of interviews with the major candidates.

Q. Four candidates on the Democratic side, all familiar, all experienced in politics. What are the stakes here? Why should people get interested?

A. . . . First of all, there are differences here and there, are choices that are quite dramatic, choices to be made in this election. I intend, as mayor, to offer what's the best of Rudy Giuliani without the worst, to govern in a way that's very positive, as he has in some respects, and to abandon or reject some of the style and decisions that he has made that have been hurtful to the people of this city.
I also believe this is one city and that it is not helpful, that it is divisive, to define it as something else, as two cities. I fully appreciate how complex and diverse the city is. . . .

Q. May I stop you ----

A. Yeah.

Q. ---- and push you back a couple of steps? You said you would take the best of Rudy Giuliani and reject the worst. Tell us in specific terms what you would do that reflects the best and what you would do that rejects the worst.

A. O.K., giving credit where it's due, I think Rudy's major long-term contribution for the city is to have shattered the myth that you can't govern New York, that if you've got the smarts and you've got the strength, you can govern New York. It's very hard, it's very tough, but you can do that. . . .
Rudy's very smart, he's focused. He gets enormous credit for the reduction in crime, which is a baseline change and shift in the city, the 72-percent reduction in the murder rates I think has been a tremendous boon to the city. It's tremendously important, and has to be sustained. . . .
However, and there are huge howevers, stylistically my view of Rudy Giuliani is that he has only one M.O. He decides on a public policy; he doesn't do it by consensus, he doesn't do it by bringing in the best and most knowledgeable people in the city, which is an enormous talent bank. And he makes the decision and he single focuses, which is a strength and then it's a weakness because his only M.O. is if you disagree with him, he fights with you and he tries to humiliate you. . . .

Q. Do you have other things beyond style? In other words, how would a Hevesi ----

A. Yes, I think his unwillingness to deal with public education, I think, is a very serious criticism that I would make of him. . . . Obviously there were some positive changes in the public school system. But I think what the mayor did was systematically create the impression that he was powerless to affect school policy when it's not true. And when he had to, he affected school policy. . . .
The issue is smaller schools and paying teachers sufficiently so we can deal with the shortage of teachers. You've got 21,000 teachers who are eligible to retire. What induces them to stay on when we have 85,000 kids right now who don't have classrooms and the number keeps growing because the city is a magnet? Where is the program to train parents to navigate the school system, to have expectations for their kids, to help with homework, create an environment in the home? That's a critical variable at any learning process.
Where is the longer school day? Where are the management techniques? I mean, this idea of overcrowding with the Board of Education, whose only answer is give us $11 billion, we'll build new schools. Well, you've got to be a little bit creative as a manager. . . .

Q. What do you think of the teachers?

A. I think there are some great teachers and some terrible teachers. And if you talk about the union itself, my attitude toward the union is I come out of the labor movement, so I have a sort of an appreciation that a labor leader's job is to protect their members. And sometimes I'll disagree with how they do that. But the answer to that is not to demonize the union, for a couple of reasons. I don't think they deserve it. These are professional people. Most teachers are idealists. The starting teachers are working for $31,000 a year, in New York. That's why we're losing a lot of them. . . .

Q. You want to have -- spend more on schools, spend at least the same, more on cops, raise their salaries. Where's it going to come from in this climate?

A. No. 1, hopefully, first, we do have surpluses for this -- for the fiscal year that just ended. And hopefully for this next 12-month period. Two, I think we're going to have to be much more cautious and austere in subsequent budgets. And that means as mayor, the first thing I will do in January is instruct my commissioners, should I be the mayor, to offer budget submissions at the same dollar figure as the year before. That we go into these discussions with an inflation rate saving. And then make the judgments as to where we provide exceptions. . . .

Q. So if you're mayor, can New Yorkers expect, in three or four or five years, either substantial cuts in services or increases in taxes or some combination of those things?

A. If the economy goes sour, they could expect that from whoever the mayor is. I think that's the reality. That's what you expected when we were in recession. That's what you expected with Rudy Giuliani. There were dramatic reductions in services in the first two years of the Giuliani administration. Hopefully that doesn't happen. . . .

Q. What are your priorities for cuts?

A. The reason I'm not itemizing now is, No. 1, it's all theoretical. Lots of people get upset. I think the first cut would be, with some exceptions like police, fire and public schools, probably start with an across-the-board strategy that everybody has to come up with plans to live within the number figures from the prior year as a baseline. . . .

Q. Would any services be inviolate from cuts? Would you take any and say, "No matter what happens, I'm not going to touch this service?"

A. Yes, policing -- although there are reforms internally that you could make that will offset some of the losses. And schools is driven by law. If you have more kids in the schools, you have to have teachers and classrooms.

Q. Taxes in an austere period -- are you open to increases if necessary?

A. All I wish to suggest is if we needed to, I would reestablish that income tax surcharge.

Q. But you're not ruling out any other tax increases, depending on the situation of the economy?

A. You just absolutely don't want to do that, but you don't rule out anything. You never ever rule out anything. Anybody who rules it out is not telling you the truth. You don't know what the circumstances -- how bad does it get. But you make every effort to avoid across-the-board tax increases. . . .

Q. How do you respond to people who might suggest that sometimes you get too caught up in the minutia, percentages of debt, the different sections of the budget, and that you don't have necessarily broader thoughts about policy and the effect of the policy on the different areas of government on the citizens?

A. I don't know who those people are, I've never heard that. I think that that's the claim of someone who is not knowledgeable about government. That somebody who is knowledgeable ----

Q. The mayor says that about you at times, that you're lost in your budget numbers and that you don't really understand the broader picture.

A. No, the mayor's purpose in doing that is to avoid whatever the criticism I'm making. It's a bit called diversion. He either says that or he says, "Oh, you're being political." He said you're being political about 1,100 times in his term. Being political means they're criticizing me, they're really right. I have no answer to it, but I've got to respond in some way. I mean, that's nonsense.
I've just outlined for you a global view of this city, where we ought to be going. I haven't even gotten into detail about how we ought to interact as a people in the context of our ethnic diversity. And there again I'll be a critic of the mayor. I think the mayor has to have a warm, trusting relationship with the leadership of every ethnic community, starting with the African-American and Latino communities in their diversity, or the complex communities. And that's hard work, that's reaching out, that's hiring the best people from their communities into government so the government looks like the city. And that's an enormous talent bank that's been ignored by the mayor. . . .

Q. Are there people, though, who work for him, say, Commissioner Kerik, who seemed to give the mayor credit for some of the policing in the city, or Chancellor Levy, who you might keep in your administration if you were elected?

A. Everything's open. I think Kerik's done a good job. I like Harold Levy. I'm carefully not identifying a short list of people I would hire, that's the ultimate -- I'm just not prepared to do that until I get elected. . . .

Q. You like Harold Levy?

A. I like Harold Levy.

Q. Does that mean you think he's done a good job?

A. I think on many fronts he's skillful and has done a good job. I think he probably shouldn't have mixed into the politics. . . .

Q. And your view is that if the mayor were a different person, then the current structure, the Board of Ed., a chancellor, could exist, that they should stay? . . .

A. What I would seek to do is have an 11-member board -- I proposed this seven or eight months ago -- an 11-member board, six appointed by the mayor, with one major additional variable that's different. Which is, each of the 11 members of this board would have their credentials fixed in statute. They wouldn't be the mayor's friend or crony or deputy mayor. They would have to have some established credential that allows them to contribute expertise to the job of the board, which I would also restrict and define. . . .

Q. Let me take you back to policing. All the candidates have professed admiration for Rudy Giuliani's police management. But when you scratch the surface, they often would do things very differently. . . .They aren't so happy with a lot of quality-of-life initiatives. Where do you stand on the particulars?

A. . . . I think now it's a question of, on the margins, continuing to reduce the crime rates; we want to keep doing that. But you do that by heavier doses of prevention. That's community policing, that's requiring precinct commanders to be in regular, institutionalized contact with community leaders, church leaders, elected officials to develop a focus, to develop priorities, to develop strategies. It's to put cops on the beat who have good relationships with the store owners and with the local community groups so that there's an exchange of information so there's a trust. It's establishing that the behavior of the police is no less aggressive than it was, but aggressive when it's necessary, not aggressive routinely, which causes a great deal of tension and friction and suspicion, particularly in the minority communities. It means fewer street sweeps probably. It means shifting -- it could be the same tactics, but on a precinct level.
Now, those are decisions that I don't make as mayor: my commissioner makes, his commanders make, the community leaders make. We create a climate where they can do that. 
My style of management, by the way, is not to tell my investment bankers or the lawyers who deal with the claims operation how to make the specific decision. I create the climate where they can use their expertise, because they're much more expert than I am in running their operations. . . .

Q. Do you believe the police deserve a raise beyond what the uniform coalition has bargained for?

A. Yeah, probably. Yes, I do.

Q. Substantially more?

A. Yeah, and again, don't hold me to numbers because I don't want to get into negotiations through this on-the-record interview. But here's a Police Department. If you believe in performance standards, however that's measured, the Police Department of the City of New York has done an extraordinary job in terms of performance, it really has over time. . . .

Q. We've spent a lot of time, understandably, talking about public safety, talking about education. Let's say you think those are the first two most important things. What's three, four and five?

A. Job growth. Developing strategies to sustain jobs and industry in the city and encourage new industry to come to the city. It is -- the resources we get to meet our mission come from the wealth in the city. When Wall Street pays out $13 billion in bonuses, we tax that. That pays for case managers and teachers and cops and firefighters. And that is -- let me phrase it this way: information technology and the revolution we're going through is New York City's great opportunity. It's also a great danger. The opportunity is we're smarter than anybody, we'll find a way to profit from somebody's new invention. If they didn't invent it here, they'll bring it here to market it, they'll bring it here to do the I.P.O., they'll bring it here to hire the lawyers to beat the I.R.S. We'll profit from it.
The danger is, however, for example with Wall Street, no Wall Street firm with modern technology needs to be in New York. They can be in Boise, Idaho or Fiji. That's not the threat. The threat is they take one stop on the PATH train out to Jersey.

Q. Has your campaign been fair? There's obviously assertions that you have not properly charged services to the cost of the campaign, the Campaign Finance Board as of Monday meets to decide whether or not to give you matching funds. . . .

A. The answer is I don't know. They're doing an audit of our campaign. They're doing audits of every campaign. Most of the time these audits in the past with every campaign have found a problem here or a problem there or a technical ignoring of some provision or they come up with a new interpretation. I know former candidates for mayor, there's an incumbent mayor that has had huge fines. Is there a willful intent on it? The answer is no.

Q. An important issue we haven't touched is housing. Everybody agrees there's not enough of it and it's too expensive. Do you lean toward greater use of city housing subsidies to create government, in essence, government housing?

A. . . . What we have proposed is to amortize the debt using some revenue streams that either exist, which I'll mention, or that are potentially brand new. It's better to be lucky than good.

Q. Are you talking about the World Trade Center?

A. The World Trade Center, yeah. And my understanding -- here's the World Trade Center run by the Port Authority, pays the city a fee in lieu of taxes, pilots, payments in lieu of taxes of $30 million. And that when Silverstein management company takes over, that they're going to pay real estate taxes of about $100 million. So that's $70 million new money for the city.
Battery Park City . . . throws off a profit that's approaching $50 million, each year, that comes to the city. The mayor puts that in the general fund. I think if you take that plus the $70 million new or the $100 million total from the World Trade Center plus the $50 million, amortize it -- and by the way the $50 million goes up each year -- it's $37 million, it's $41 million -- that you have right there a billion and a half dollars in a housing trust fund. . . .

HEADLINE: Q & A; 
Reading Statistical Tea Leaves

BYLINE:  By Karen W. Arenson; Karen W. Arenson covers higher education for The Times.

 BODY:
Harold Hodgkinson likes to say that "demography is destiny." As a demographer focused on education, he has looked at how births, ethnic backgrounds, family income and other factors shape education. He is convinced that careful scrutiny of such data can lead to better education policy. A former dean at Simmons and Bard colleges, Dr. Hodgkinson led the National Institute of Education under President Gerald R. Ford. Since 1987, he has directed the Center for Demographic Policy at the Institute for Educational Leadership in Washington. 
 What is the most important demographic trend affecting higher education? 
 The No. 1 demographic change is probably the increase in ethnic diversity in America. If you look 20 years out, 63 percent of the new population growth in the United States will be Hispanic and Asian. And virtually all of the diversity in America is concentrated in 10 states. Hispanics are now the largest minority group in the United States, and 34 percent of them live in California, 19 percent in Texas, 10 percent in New York and 7 percent in Florida. All of the other states are under 5 percent. Of the Asian population in America, nearly half live in three metropolitan areas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. And 75 percent of the black population is in the Southeast and the Mississippi Delta. 
What does that mean for colleges?
There is a move afoot to have every college be a mirror of the national population distribution. Given that 80 percent of kids going to college do so in their own state, looking like the country as a whole becomes a challenge in a state where minorities are 10 percent of the population. It also raises the issue of whether you should have the same proportion of minority faculty. The recruitment of minority faculty becomes a real crisis, because graduate schools are not turning out that many minority Ph.D.'s. One area where there will be a real problem is in developing new teachers. There has been a fairly pervasive decline in the number of blacks and Hispanics majoring in education -- a decline of about 30 percent.
You say you like demographics because population trends are predictable. Have there been any surprises in the last 20 years?
There was only one surprise: the percentage of children living below the poverty line. 
The strong economy pushed it down somewhat in recent years, but for decades the number was about 20 percent of American children. Any lessons there for colleges and universities?
For the lowest 20 percent, the amount of household income required to send children to college has increased, while their income has not increased at all. Tuition as a proportion of income has risen. But as we look at programs to help the poor, we have to remember that they are not all minorities. We tend to associate poverty mostly with minorities. But the largest number of poor children are white. Of the 14 million poor children in 1999, 8.9 million were white, 4 million were black and 3.9 million were Hispanic. But the children in poverty represented 16 percent of all white children, 37 percent of all black children and 36 percent of Hispanic children. 
What are some of the other demographic trends? 
People are moving much more frequently. About 43 million Americans move every year. That means people are changing jobs, and employers need to know who they are and what they can do. So they need a piece of paper -- a college diploma or a certificate stating their skills. That is putting pressure on universities and colleges for those pieces of paper to mean the same thing. But there is almost no way you can guarantee that they do. It will only be a matter of time before states require tests to show what students have learned in college. But that would be terrible. 
Did anyone predict there would be so many adult students?
Nobody in 1980 assumed that the number of adults going to college would be so high today. Of the 15 million students in college, almost half of them are adults with kids and jobs. The Joe College stereotype -- the 18- to-22-year-old full-time student in residence on a campus -- accounts for only 20 percent of the 15 million students. 
Has the increase in older students run its course, or do you think it will continue?
I think it will continue. A lot of people are beginning to come back to higher education for a capstone experience in their 40's, 50's and 60's. Not for a better job, but for a vindication of their life. I was speaking at a commencement a few months ago and an older man walked across the stage to receive his doctoral degree. Someone shouted out, "Way to go, grandpa." I just love it. There is no reason to think that higher education was designed solely for the post-pubescent adolescent.
What does that mean for colleges faced with serving such students?
Older students have different needs. A whole lot of 30- and 40-year-olds have been out of education a long time. They may have a lot of innate smarts, but they don't remember the quadratic equation. So a lot of remedial education is to get 40-year-olds to remember how to write a good theme, and that is fine.
Many of the immigrants who come to the United States count on higher education to help them make it. How well does it work for them?
American higher education performs a unique function. No other country takes such a diverse group of people and turns them into the middle class. In the 1900's, it worked for Italians, Germans, French and English-speaking immigrants. Now it is working for Koreans and the Hmong. It is even working for the black population that is already here. Twenty percent of black households now have a higher income than the average for white households. That's never been true before. The mobility machine is clicking along like it should. We're very cynical, especially about our education system. But we need some appreciation for the kind of miracle we accomplish that doesn't happen in other countries -- it's all due to our system of education. 
So is college really available to all?
The percentage of college students who are minorities is virtually the same in every state as the percentage of high school students who are minorities. In California, for example, 54 percent of high school graduates are minorities, while 53 percent of college students are minorities. In Minnesota, 10 percent of high school graduates are minorities, while 9 percent of college students are minorities.
If you had a billion dollars to invest in education, how would you spend it?
I would spend most of it on the years before college, not on colleges. Money spent on Head Start and Trio and other precollege programs saves lots of money later on. To remediate someone at age 20 when their last 14 years were misused is really a chore. It can be done. But it is not efficient. College is really the icing on the cake.

HEADLINE: Volunteers on Vacation 

BYLINE:  By Randy Kennedy; Randy Kennedy, a reporter for The Times, writes the Tunnel Vision column in the Metro Section.

DATELINE: Mongouge, St. Lucia 

 BODY:
A young teacher sat atop a windswept ridge on this Caribbean island and read to a group of student volunteers part of the stirring speech that Robert F. Kennedy delivered to an earlier generation of students at the University of California in 1966:
 "You live in the most privileged nation on earth. You are the most privileged citizens of that privileged nation. . . . You can use your enormous privilege and opportunity to seek purely private pleasure and gain. But history will judge you, and as the years pass, you will ultimately judge yourself, on the extent to which you have used your gifts to lighten and enrich the lives of your fellow man." 
 Considering the setting, it was hard to keep from wondering whether this was quite what Kennedy had in mind. 
In the distance, behind the teacher and the students, the blue Caribbean shimmered. Set off against it like a Turner seascape was the grandeur of Gros Piton, one of two volcanic peaks that make St. Lucia probably the most picturesque tourist destination in the Caribbean.
The families of the 19 students, who had come from high schools around the United States, had paid some $3,500, plus at least $700 in airfare, to send the teenagers to this island for four weeks with an international community service organization called Global Routes.
Before traveling to Mongouge, a rural village where they would live for two and a half weeks to help build a community center for older residents, the students spent a week getting used to the island at Balenbouche Estate, an inn on a beautiful, wooded former sugar plantation that overlooks the ocean. The students hiked and swam beneath a waterfall and snacked on passion fruit from a farmer's trees.
And as soon as they finished with their volunteer project, they would spend the remaining days having what the brochure described as "fun, adventure and reflection," snorkeling, sailing and sightseeing on nearby Martinique.
Even after reading the enticing brochures back home, the students seemed a little surprised that helping the world was turning out to be so, well, alluring.
"It's been a lot cozier than I thought," said Kate Wheatcroft, 16, from Westboro, Mass. "I thought we were just going to be eating rice and beans."
This is not to suggest that what the students experienced was anything like the Caribbean vacations many had been on with their parents. In the village, a good number of the students lived in cinderblock homes with no running water, and many were seeing poverty up close for the first time. Even at their sugar plantation retreat, they had no air-conditioning, no hot water for their showers and armies of fire ants to fend off.
But their time on the island was at least as many parts exotic, multicultural summer camp as it was Peace Corps. And it is those two ingredients, in a wide variety of proportions, that are fueling a growing cottage industry for affluent high school students who -- instead of packing off to camp or to Europe with mom and dad -- want to spend their summers bettering themselves (and in many cases their college applications) by helping to better the world.
Such summer programs are doing more than simply helping high school students find new ways to perform community service, which is often required by their schools. They are also doing more than adding a fancy new international twist to candy striping or pitching in at the local soup kitchen.
They are, in essence, creating a new philosophy for the next generation about how to exercise global concern. Yes, you are privileged and you should use your gifts to help others around the world. But there is no reason not to have fun and adventure and some degree of American comfort at the same time. Yes, it is a good thing to help build a community center or clear jungle for a soccer field. But that does not mean you shouldn't spend your money -- usually a much larger sum than you are giving to the volunteer project -- to relax and sightsee while you are there, to go elephant riding while in Nepal or on safari in Kenya.
"It's really hard to look at this as a kind of junior Peace Corps," said Sandy Bass, editor and publisher of Private School Insider, a monthly newsletter that reports on schools in the New York region. "It's different. But maybe it's the only way it will work. Many of these kids are not going to go to another country just to sleep on the ground and work all day."
Companies that arrange foreign trips with time devoted to volunteerism have grown from a mere handful in the late 1980's to more than 50 today, with hundreds of excursions every summer, some costing up to $6,000 for six weeks. The trend has been spurred partly by the heavy emphasis American high schools now place on volunteerism -- also called service learning -- as an important element of secondary education. And the programs seem to be where many students are looking to find that element. The organizations, both nonprofit and commercial, provide not only the experience but also something almost as important: certificates attesting to the number of hours spent volunteering. 
The trips, especially to more exotic locales like Southeast Asia and Africa, have become the summer thing to do, according to the students in St. Lucia. "It's a really popular trend where I live in Connecticut," said Amanda Listfield, 16, from Weston, Conn., a boarding student at the Hill School in Pottstown, Pa.
There is a great deal of disagreement among educators over whether these kinds of programs truly teach students the value of volunteerism or simply provide them with glorified vacations. That debate echoes the broader discussion over whether community service should be required at all.
Judging by the thousands of applications this summer for trips from Tortola to Tanzania, students do not seem to be as concerned about the questions.
"When people go to Africa, one of the first things they think of is a safari," said Kenneth Hahn, a director of Global Routes, a nonprofit organization based in Berkeley, Calif., that began in 1986 by taking one group of students to Kenya and this summer has 18 groups visiting 13 countries. "It would be a bit of a raw deal to go all the way to Africa and not get that sense of that part of Kenya," said Mr. Hahn, whose organization is one of the most respected in the field.
He added that the programs' creators view the cultural aspects -- especially the time students spend living in villagers' homes, learning about language and values and teaching a bit about their own -- to be as important, if not more, than the labor and money they contribute. The tourism and adventure elements that usually bookend every trip are intended to be a part of that cultural education, too.
"The way we look at it is frosting on the cake," he said. "They've worked very hard to make their cake, and then they get to eat a little frosting."
Whoa, hot dogs and French fries!"
It was a breezy and balmy Saturday afternoon, July 7, the fifth and last day of orientation at the sugar plantation for the students who had traveled to St. Lucia.
The next morning, they would load up their backpacks and suitcases and move several miles to the three rural villages -- Mongouge, Morne Sion and Ponyon -- that would be home away from home until almost the end of the month.
There was a low-volume hum of anxiety about what was to come. An exercise the previous night had presented the group, composed of 15 girls and 4 boys, with some uncomfortable cultural situations they might encounter with their new neighbors: "A community member who is extremely helpful every day on the work site is asking you to marry him every day." ("Are they really going to ask you to marry them?" asked one girl.) 
So it was perhaps fitting that their next-to-last meal before leaving was so all-American. The dogs and fries were served on the veranda of the estate house, a genteel 18th-century French manor surrounded by flaming-red Flamboyant trees and ambling horses.
The majority of students who gathered around the tables were from New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Most attended suburban public schools, although six went to private schools, including two boarding schools. They were, by and large, upper middle class, though three described themselves as middle class. There was one African-American and one Asian-American among them. And their parents were generally well-paid professionals -- lawyers, doctors, publishers, architects -- though there was a cook, a security guard and a teacher.
About three-quarters of their schools required community service hours, and nearly all of the students had taken part in volunteer projects at home -- some minor, some impressive. A few had traveled within the United States for volunteer projects like Habitat for Humanity and a couple had made this kind of trip before. Most said volunteerism was an important part of their lives.
But college, clearly, was on the minds of nearly every student. On the wish lists were destinations ranging from Stanford, Columbia and other highly competitive universities to small liberal arts colleges and state schools. 
Most took pains to stress that their main reason for taking the trip was not to make themselves more attractive to colleges. And anyone who did it just for that reason, they said, was not going to fool any college admissions officer. "If any club in school has the name 'leader' or 'service' on it, everybody's in it because they think it will look good on college applications, and I'm just sick of things like that," said Kate Wheatcroft. 
But the students said they believed that community service, be it just down the road or in Dominica, would help present them as more fully rounded applicants. 
"My college adviser said that community service is going to be my hook," said Sean Chan, 17, who attends Lawrenceville, a prestigious boarding school in southern New Jersey, and who has been on two other Global Routes trips. (He said he wants to make a career of running such programs.)
Those students on their first foreign service trip said they had chosen St. Lucia because they saw it as a perfect introduction to helping the world: tropical, fun, beautiful, but also a place where there was poverty and a culture at least somewhat unlike their own. One 17-year-old girl had spent the summer before in France with another service organization, Global Works, sprucing up an archeological site. She said the culture was not much different, and she hadn't worked very hard -- "Mostly, it just ended up being digging weeds."
Another student, Alison Herland, 17, from Clarks Summit, Pa., said she had originally wanted to go to Thailand on a Global Routes program that would have cost about $6,000. But she had college visits to make during the summer -- New York University, Tulane and Boston University are among her top choices -- so she needed a shorter trip.
"And also, I think that the Caribbean is beautiful and the culture is different," she said. "Not so different, but enough to get a kind of a culture shock."
The culture shocks that St. Lucia administered as the students began the volunteer portion of their trip were of the kind that seem increasingly more common in a postmodern world. Some of the shocks, in fact, were not from St. Lucian culture at all but from their own, reflected back at them.
For example, St. Lucians love reggae and calypso and soca music. It turns out they also love American country-and-western music. And so, as the students began their first scorching day mixing cement in tiny Mongouge, they were exposed to a strange new music that most had never listened to before: Dolly Parton, George Jones and Merle Haggard blasting out of the sound system from a nearby house. ("While you're cheatin' on me," sang the Louvin Brothers, "I'm praying for you.")
The modest local homes, in which the students were living in groups of twos and threes, were also an unexpected mix of the crude and the comfortable, with elements of privation in one room and big American appliances in another. There was poverty, undeniably, but not the desperate kind that Derek Walcott, the Nobel Prize-winning poet, mentions in his writings about growing up on St. Lucia.
Tammi Wyka, from Montvale, N.J., was one of those who had no running water in her house. "The bucket shower was insane," she reported after the first night in the village. "It's not something I want to do again."
But later she mentioned how nice the family's stereo was. "They have the same stereo system I have at home," she said, smiling. "I told them, I'm like, 'Dude, I have that back home!' "
Despite such recognitions, it appeared that the students were clearly learning things about lives very unlike their own. And also about a kind of labor that many had seen before only at a comfortable distance. 
They stacked cinderblocks and lumber and carried bags of cement heavier than some of the girls. They took turns with a wobbly pickax to carve a sewer pit into the rock-hard earth next to the center. They learned how to follow orders from the construction foreman, a somber local man named Lawrence Alphonse. And they saw the beneficiaries of the building they were helping to erect: elderly villagers, on their way up the hill, shaded from the strong sun under their black umbrellas.
Also, of course, because they were high school students, the young volunteers occasionally seemed to be playing their parts in an episode of "Real World."
"Sam, take it off!" the girls yelled as one student, Sam Scott, pulled off his T-shirt.
Because of the $300 that each student had to contribute to the project -- a sum in addition to the price of the trip and that most had solicited from friends and family -- the students seemed much more invested in what they were doing. That money paid for all the supplies and tools to build the center. Perhaps in part because of those contributions, the villagers were very welcoming of the students. (The families who put up students in their homes were also paid for doing so.)
It was the second year that Mongouge and the nearby villages had been host to a group of students from Global Routes. Mary Pierre, a former health aide who serves as unofficial mayor of Mongouge and plays a large role in deciding what projects the villages need -- last year, students built outhouses -- said the students and townspeople got to know one another well in a short time. "When they were leaving, last year, everybody was sharing tears," she said. "The students were very hard-working. I did not expect so much from them."
The students had not known what to expect from the villagers, either, and seemed surprised at how easy it was to fit in. They started picking up phrases in French patois, spoken in rural areas almost as often as English, the official language of the island. They spent their evenings eating dorado and stewed chicken and dasheen -- and sometimes macaroni and cheese -- with their families. And also, usually, watching American sitcoms on television. (Several families have cable.)
The girls who stayed in Mrs. Pierre's home immediately took to calling her mom. And during the first night spent there, local teenage girls braided the American girls' hair into cornrows, a fashion trend that quickly caught on among the girls in the group.
But the group also found that the level of comfort they enjoyed in the community meant learning harsh lessons about how some St. Lucians viewed America, or at least how the St. Lucians thought Americans viewed them.
One night, a local man told some of the students about the time he had spent working in the United States. 
"He said, 'People come here and we're all nice and friendly to you,' " recounted one student, Katrina Reiser, 15, from Lincoln, Mass. "But when he went to America, he said, people were unfriendly and they were racists. He said they were like beasts."
Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., believes programs like the one in St. Lucia can open the eyes of privileged students who would probably not learn much about poverty or see their country from such a critical perspective during a European semester abroad or traveling with their parents. 
But he and many other education officials question whether most community service trips teach the right lessons about volunteerism. Do they serve only to make students feel good about themselves for having accomplished something? Do the programs really teach anything about how the world works?
"The point of a Peace Corps kind of service is that you have something to offer, some special skills or something of value to teach," he said. "And on the learning side, the only programs like this that really work are intensive programs of service and learning that are integrated, such as studying economics while working for a poverty program in some country."
Elizabeth Hollander, executive director of Campus Compact, a coalition of 800 colleges and universities advocating service learning, said that ideal community service is "an opportunity to be active in the community and to reflect on the conditions you're seeing in the community and asking yourself the larger questions."
"To us," she said, "the larger questions are: Why do these conditions exist, who should be fixing them and what's my responsibility as an American citizen? It's not just sending them to a place but helping prepare them for what they're going to see, what their role is and how they can be responsible in that role. And what kind of connection to the project is made by the community, so it becomes something that was not just done to them?"
Mr. Botstein said students should first concentrate on community service within their own community. 
"It's not that the Caribbean isn't a good place to go," he said. "Yes, there is poverty in the Caribbean. But for goodness' sake, there's Caribbean poverty right here in the United States."
Calling the trips no more than junkets, he added: "Any student who needs to have this experience to write about in their college essay is not going to get admitted to a first-class university." (Putney Student Travel reprints on its Web site a sampler of admissions essays from happy customers who got into the college of their choice.)
Other college officials say that even the most vacationlike volunteerism program can still teach positive values. "I don't think it's possible to misuse this opportunity," said Peter V. Johnson, senior associate director of undergraduate admissions at Columbia University. "Some students do this because they think it's going to look good on their resume. But even if they do, they're going to derive a benefit from this experience 90 percent of the time."
The proportions of work and play in the programs vary widely. Along the spectrum, Global Routes falls somewhere in the middle, with slightly more time spent working and living in the communities than on recreation, tourism and summer-camp team-building activities.
Other programs, like Amigos de las Americas, which has sent volunteers to Mexico and Central and South America since 1965, charge comparatively modest costs to cover expenses, and participants spend nearly all the time in the community that is being helped.
At the other end of the spectrum is Rustic Pathways, a commercial operation that offers trips to Australia, New Zealand, Africa, Thailand and the Fiji Islands. The company advertises community service "add ons" to its purely recreational trips, in which students can, for example, surf in Fiji for 10 days for $2,195 and then participate in a seven-day community service project in a Fijian village at the end of the trip for an additional $995. The program's Web site calls the project "a community service 'snapshot' in a welcoming, clean and interesting environment." 
Compared to, say, Habitat for Humanity, which provides no recreational extras and costs nothing but a small donation, the community service trips can seem -- and do, to many parents -- very expensive. 
Mr. Hahn says the costs of his organization's trips pay for the staff members who care for the students, the families who lodge them, local transportation, food and insurance policies, as well as for the tourism and recreation portions, like guided hikes, boat trips and safaris. Global Routes, like a handful of other nonprofit programs, helps find grants for some applicants who can't afford the trips, or provides scholarships when space is available.
Some parents believe the companies, many of which visit high schools and arrange "coffee nights" to promote their offerings, simply charge too much for what they provide.
"Why spend all that money to go to some exotic place when there are people you can help right in your own backyard?" said Lynda Ludwigson, whose son, Jake, as a student at the American School in London, had pushed to take a community service trip to Tortola, in the British Virgin Islands. Classmates were going, anxious for every advantage on their college applications. But Jake's parents were skeptical, and he instead spent three weeks last summer tutoring an impoverished Afghani student in a local school. He wrote about the experience in his essay to Georgetown University, where he will start in the fall.
One American School classmate, Matthew Christoph, went to Tortola three summers ago and then to Kenya. "There are so many kids going on these things," he said. Some students went to Tortola for the wrong reasons, he admitted, and a few girls were kicked off the trip, apparently for drinking. But Matthew said he got a lot out of his experiences. "The President of the United States hasn't even been to half the countries these kids have gone to," he added.
For many parents, apparently, the costs of such experiences clearly do not outweigh their benefits. "We get some families that if we double-billed them, I don't think they would notice," said Chris Yager, director and founder of Where There Be Dragons, which runs adventure programs in Asia with an element of community service.
And despite the costs and the questions about their value -- for building better citizens and bolstering college applications -- the movement is showing no signs of slowing down.
"When we started this in 1986, it wasn't any more or less popular than any of our other programs," said Mr. Hahn of Global Routes. "Today we have more students doing community service programs than we have in all of our other travel programs combined."
The students in St. Lucia have no trouble explaining why.
"It feels so good to be doing this," said Alison Herland. Later, she glanced past the rising cinderblock walls they were building to the green mountains and blue waters beyond.
"Look at this view while we're working!"

HEADLINE: Community Schools 

BYLINE:  By Philip Nobel; Philip Nobel is a New York design critic.

DATELINE: Craryville, N.Y. 

 BODY:
On a Friday afternoon toward the end of the school year, the streets were quiet in this rural upstate town. There were two or three cars at the gas station, four at a local diner, and the odd tractor-trailer rolling through the empty fields toward the Massachusetts border, 10 miles away over the crest of the Taconic Hills.
 But in the Taconic Hills Central School, whose sports fields straddle County Route 11A, the community life that seemed lacking elsewhere was in full view. The school's two media centers were filled with researchers young and old. A community room, just inside the public entrance, showed signs of a welcome party for some French exchange students, and later that day it would be host to a local food co-op. The school's "aquatic center" and weight room -- the envy of any big-city health club -- would also open later for public use: $1 for district residents, $2 for everyone else. Preparations were also under way for a summer concert series at the school's 1,000-seat auditorium that can, weather permitting, open into an outdoor public amphitheater built into the front of the school. 
 And all around, the 1,850 students in kindergarten through 12th grade were going about the business of learning in a school that represents a bold new direction in school design. 
The United States is in the sixth year of a school building boom. While budget overruns in New York City have threatened to stall construction, the pace nationally is not expected to slow through 2003, according to the annual education construction report by American School and University, a magazine on school facilities. With so much once-in-a-lifetime municipal financing being applied to school construction -- $36 billion was spent last year, up more than 20 percent from 1999 -- this period will define for decades the shape of the schools that shape young minds. And most new schools, public and private, are being built along the lines of Taconic Hills. 
"About 2,000 new school buildings were built in 2000, and I would say that every single one had to make concessions to the community to get funded," said Joe Agron, the magazine's editor in chief. "It's not a far stretch if you think about it. Seniors don't have school-age kids anymore."
An idea that first emerged in the late 1960's but didn't fly until the 90's, the concept is variously known as community schools, community learning centers, shared facilities or full-service schools. Where older buildings endeavored to create an icon to represent "education" within the community -- but kept that community at bay by creating an insular world of learning within -- these new schools are attempting to bring the life of the community into the building itself.
This can take the form of schools that integrate public libraries, performing-arts centers and recreation centers -- community functions that have long existed informally in schools but are now being expanded with an eye to extracurricular patrons. Municipalities are finding it easier to sell taxpayers on the idea of a school if it gives back something more tangible than education.
"It's a survival thing," Mr. Agron said. "What schools are finding is that the only way they can get a bond act passed is to build in community centers, offer evening classes or open the recreation center to the public."
At Taconic Hills, the integrated community solution helped break a construction impasse that had lasted for nearly 30 years. The site was bought in 1968, but no agreement was reached on what to build or how to finance it until 1997; after 11 other design solutions foundered, the combined approach suggested by J. Louis Turpin of Rhinebeck Architecture and Planning was approved.
"The reality is that schools need to serve the broader community," Mr. Turpin said, "whether it's to fulfill economic or educational needs."
Last year, to free up more classroom space, New York City's chancellor evicted community groups that were not needed for instruction. And in new construction, the city has only dabbled in the trend, segregating common areas in anticipation of public access. But in May, ground was broken in Jamaica, Queens, on the High School for Law Enforcement and Public Safety/Police Athletic League Community Center. The 900-student school, being built on the league's site, is aimed at low-income children interested in law-enforcement careers. While the school and league will not overlap, they will share recreation facilities to get "maximum bang for the buck," says Dan Andrews, spokesman for the Queens borough president, who threw in $5 million in discretionary funds; the league is contributing $4.25 million to the $108 million project.
In Nashville, the Park Avenue Elementary School has spaces for a host of community functions -- a free health clinic, continuing education and recreation as well as a small police post. The hope was for students to learn, by their proximity, to trust the police, but also to add more police presence to a low-income neighborhood. 
Park Avenue and four similar Nashville schools were conceived as part of a larger settlement of a longstanding desegregation court order: along with enhanced educational options and facilities, the community thrust is intended to help level the playing field for inner-city students. "It brings the parents into the schools," said Tracy Libros, director of student assignment services for Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools. "It brings services to people rather than people to services." The downside, she notes, is the expense of running programs not usually found in schools.
Other districts have introduced more commercial services. The Fort Crawford Elementary School in New Kensington, Pa., completed in January 2000, was designed from the ground up to accommodate after-hours use as a business teleconferencing center ($200 an hour, plus line charges). The room, which can be entered without passing through class areas, is set up to receive satellite transmissions and for two-way teleconferencing. During school hours, the technology can be put to use for educational exchanges or virtual field trips. Private industry donated the equipment.
The increase in integrated-service schools concerns some educators. Roger Hart, director of the Children's Environmental Research Group at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, balks at the idea of opening schools to outside functions that could pave the way for the increasing commercialization of schools.
"If it's a need relating to social development in the community, I love that idea," he said. "But if it's purely a business relationship, it could be deleterious -- it's confusing to students. There should be sufficient funding for local schools to survive without turning to business. I get scared when what is clearly the public domain is moved in on by private resources." 
Dr. Hart, co-author of "Cities for Children: Children's Rights, Poverty and Urban Management," ticks off what he thinks should be brought into the discussion: "Who's protecting the neutrality, if you like, of the school? Are the peripheral uses compatible with education and appropriately conceived? There is potentially a problem if there is too much activity not connected to learning going on. There's also good evidence that small schools are better for students, particularly for lower grades."
To accommodate the extra services, multiuse schools tend to be large. At 330,000 square feet -- about the size of a medium-sized shopping mall -- Taconic Hills is the largest public building in its 230-square-mile district. In this rural area, it offers students an alternative to hanging out at the mall.
About a third of the school consists of spaces that are at times available to the public, including the performing arts center. The theater was intended to bring the arts closer to the students but also as a way to appeal to the broader community, which includes an arts-oriented weekend crowd that flocks to this region not far from Tanglewood and the other cultural institutions of western Massachusetts.
"We were a tax bill to them and now we have something to offer," said John T. Oates, the superintendent of schools for the Taconic Hills district, as he showed off the auditorium. "They can enjoy our tennis courts, and our pool, and this theater." 
As the boom in school construction continues, the simple logic of the integrated school -- the economies of scale, the appeal to taxpayers, the perceived benefits to students -- may sway more school committees to put all their eggs in one basket. "There's that adage, 'It takes a village,' "Mr. Turpin said. "How can you do that if you're segregating people from the school?"

BYLINE:  By Peggy Orenstein; Peggy Orenstein is a contributing writer for the magazine and author of "Flux: Women on Sex, Work, Love, Kids and Life in a Half-Changed World."

 BODY:
Bob's diner on Polk Street is just two blocks up from where tourists catch the cable car for a joy ride to downtown San Francisco and just beyond where the hustlers and junkies stroll. Plastic grapes festoon the walls above cracked gray vinyl booths. The chow is strictly short order. In the center of the restaurant, her tweed coat slipping onto the speckled linoleum, a 40-year-old woman sketches in a notebook. When she looks up, time bends. Phoebe Gloeckner has expectant hazel eyes and brown hair shot through with red highlights. She wears round antique spectacles over a small Band-Aid where her 2-year-old accidentally jammed them into the bridge of her nose. She may be an established medical illustrator and mother of two married to a chemistry professor, but she also, quite startlingly, has the face of her 15-year-old alter ego, Minnie, the subject of Gloeckner's semiautobiographical cartoons. Minnie, who was booted from some of the finest Bay Area private schools. Minnie, who was sexually involved with her mother's boyfriend. Minnie, whose best friend dosed her with Quaaludes then traded Minnie's body for more drugs. In fact, if you set the Way Back machine to a quarter-century ago, you could find the teenage Phoebe sitting in this very spot, scribbling in her diary, bearing witness to her life. Bob's was her refuge; safely above the street scene's DMZ, she wasn't likely to run into anyone here who would question what she was writing or why. 
 Now, in 2001, Gloeckner is only visiting her former stomping grounds. She lives on Long Island these days, where she is finishing "Diary of a Teenage Girl," a hybrid between a conventional and graphic novel based on the very journals she penned in this diner. The book mines the same territory as "A Child's Life and Other Stories," Gloeckner's first book, a story collection in cartoon form that R. Crumb says includes "one of the comic book masterpieces of all time." Like Crumb's, Gloeckner's work is challenging stuff, graphic in every sense of the word. But while the images are similarly explicit -- and have raised comparable charges of obscenity -- the context could not be more different. The Minnie stories describe an adolescence that is at once traumatic and picaresque. They explore the power a girl feels in her emerging sexuality as well as the damage inflicted by those who prey upon it. In the process, they raise unsettling questions about vulnerability, desire and the nature of a young woman's victimization. "Phoebe looks square in the face of extremely disturbing subject matter," says Kim Thompson, co-publisher of Fantagraphics Books, the largest publisher of alternative comics. "But she has this illustrative style that's so beautiful. It's like going to a movie that looks like Merchant-Ivory but turns out to have a Charles Bukowski story." 
 Confessional comics are an intriguing, surprisingly supple medium in which to tell young women's stories. Gloeckner is arguably the brightest light among a small cadre of semiautobiographical cartoonists -- including Debbie Drechsler and Julie Doucet -- who are creating some of the edgiest work about young women's lives in any medium. The narratives are often presented as diaries, that quintessential literary form of female adolescence. (There is virtually no tradition of diarists among teenage boys.) Perversely, even their marginalization -- as cartoonists, as literary cartoonists, as female literary cartoonists -- works in these artists' favor. Free from the pressures of the marketplace, they can explore taboo aspects of girls' lives with the illusion of safety; since their work is usually hidden behind racks of "X-Men" in shops that smell like a sweat sock, few people are likely to stumble across it. "They're like what independent films were before they stopped really being independent," says Drechsler, whose collection "Summer of Love" will be released this month. "You have total freedom. Nobody cares what you're doing because nobody's going to make money off of it."
That's how it has been for Gloeckner for years. Some call her a "cartoonist's cartoonist," a backhanded compliment that both acknowledges her exacting skill as an artist and the fact that, even for comics, her work has not sold especially well. "Phoebe is one of the most accomplished artists in terms of mastery of the medium," says Bill Griffith, the creator of Zippy the Pinhead. Griffith was among the first to publish Gloeckner's work, when she was in her late teens. "Her drawing conveys a lot of the underlying feeling of what's going on in the same way a movie can have a shot without dialogue that's a major turning point or a major insight into a character. It's a delicate balancing act. The pictures have to propel the story without overtaking it. That balance -- it's almost a tension -- occurs when a cartoonist is equally good as a writer and artist, and it's very rare."
Richard Grossinger, publisher of North Atlantic Books/Frog Ltd., which put out "A Child's Life," says: "In a perfect world, she would have as large an audience as R. Crumb or Art Spiegelman. She's that good. But we haven't been successful in letting that world know about it."
"Diary of a Teenage Girl," which will be published next spring, could change that. Inspired by, among other things, the illustrated novels of the Victorian period, it takes the form a step further. Instead of a fully illustrated graphic novel, like Spiegelman's "Maus" or Daniel Clowes's "Ghost World," Gloeckner's book is largely text that periodically bursts into comics the way a musical bursts into song: with no warning whatsoever, as if it's normal. Because its raunchier themes are explored through prose rather than through images, "Diary" has a better shot at being picked up by conventional bookstores than "A Child's Life" did. Gloeckner is the first to admit that's an exciting opportunity. She's also the first to question whether it's one she wants. 
In conversation about her work, Phoebe Gloeckner shifts arbitrarily between referring to "Minnie" and "me." "I was so needy," she remembers of herself as a teenager, followed immediately by, "In that sense, there was nothing particularly remarkable about Minnie." Because of the permeable boundary between fact and fiction in Gloeckner's life, I find myself, at times, picking peculiar arguments with her. "One of the things that interests me about Minnie," I say, "is that she is very pretty. We talk a lot about the damage done to girls by unrealistic standards of beauty but not about the vulnerability that comes when you actually meet them." 
Gloeckner replies: "I don't think Minnie was beautiful. I honestly don't."
"Well," I say, "I think she probably was. She turns heads wherever she goes." We both laugh awkwardly at the perversity of speaking in the third person. 
Gloeckner considers this for a moment. "I always hoped people would think I was pretty, but I always felt painfully ugly," she says slowly. "Painfully. Whether that was the reality or not. I know a lot of girls feel that way. I could not deal with my appearance or my sexuality. I just wanted someone to see who I was for real and love me for it. So I would talk to anybody, go anyplace with anybody in the hope that they would see me and help me." She shakes her head. "And I can't even say how I meant that."
Gloeckner is the daughter of a librarian from a blue-collar family (her mother) and an unemployed artist from a blue-nosed one (her dad). They divorced when she was 4. Eight years later, her mother remarried and moved the family from Philadelphia to San Francisco. The early Minnie stories portray a stepfather who was arbitrarily cruel and who leered at Minnie and dropped sexual innuendos. In real life, the marriage quickly deteriorated, and to shield her from the tension, Phoebe was shipped off to an elite boarding school. By the time she returned home at 15, her mother was dating again. 
There is an image that Gloeckner returns to in her work that acts as a kind of pivot point, a defining moment both in her own life and her character's. She drew it in one of her first comics at 16. It appears again, in writing this time, in "Diary of a Teenage Girl." It is not one of the more lurid images in her repertoire, but it may be the most chilling: it shows one of her mother's boyfriends, someone Minnie trusted and admired, running a casual finger across her bare midriff. It is his first tentative crossing of a line, quite literally sending out a feeler to gauge the girl's vulnerability. "When he first made those advances, my initial thought was, 'This is not right,"' she says, "but then I thought, 'Maybe it is and I don't know.' Minnie had been bombarded with adults who had no boundaries and were overtly sexual with children. You get used to that, and at a certain point you think of yourself and value yourself solely as a sexual being."
Whatever tenuous stability Minnie had felt at home crumbled as that initial touch turned into an affair. In "Minnie's 3rd Love, or Nightmare on Polk Street," a story in "A Child's Life," Gloeckner's alter ego is seen on her knees in the laundry room of her apartment building. Next to her is a "Hello Kitty" diary. Minnie looks tearfully up at her lover-surrogate father, on whom she is about to perform oral sex, begging him to tell her he loves her. In her right hand, she clutches a bottle whose label reads, "The kind of good cheap California wine that makes girls cry and perform oral sex on jerks." To escape both her shame and her obsession with her mother's boyfriend, Minnie runs away to Polk Street with another girl, a teenage junkie with whom she falls in love. She takes whatever drugs come her way, then is pimped by the girlfriend for more. "I was in a lot of pain, so I would do anything," Gloeckner says about her own life at that time. "If someone said, 'Shoot up this' or 'Take this pill,' I'd do it. I guess I didn't really care." 
Though Frog Ltd. was eager to publish "A Child's Life," its printers balked. One refused outright, the other agreed, but backed off after staff members objected to the graphic imagery in "Minnie's 3rd Love." Eventually, the second company did print the book after work hours. Gloeckner had caused controversy before: in 1995, British customs officials seized an anthology of comics that included an earlier version of the same story, claiming the laundry-room panel was child pornography. "There's resistance to something that's drawn that wouldn't exist if it were written," says Frog's Richard Grossinger. "If you're talking about child sexual abuse, 'Bastard Out of Carolina' is in many ways harsher than Phoebe's work. If you drew that, you'd be marginalized."
A British judge eventually ruled in favor of the book's distributor, but last year, when "A Child's Life" was confiscated at the French border, there was no such reversal: the book never was allowed into the country (although, interestingly, R. Crumb's comics depicting his sometimes violent sexual fantasies are readily available). "Some people think what I draw is pornography," Gloeckner says. "But there are children who experience this, who have this penis in front of their faces. They see it, so why can't I show it to make the impact clear?" 
It's a question she hasn't fully answered herself. Gloeckner describes her creative process as a wrestling match between the compulsive demands of her own vision and a fear of those who might label it "dirty." There's the voice of her publisher, who has -- no pressure -- mentioned that without the images of erect penises, her books would be easier to market. There's the voice of her mother, who has "not been pleased" with the Minnie stories. There's the voice of herself as a mother, fretful over what her daughters will think when they are old enough to see her work. There's the voice of her own shame. "I'm constantly fighting with it," she says, "But if I censor myself, it makes me feel sick. Actually physically ill." 
Ultimately, Gloeckner says, she has no choice but rigorous honesty, including this: Gloeckner doesn't flinch from the blurry lines between experimentation and exploitation. A panel in "A Child's Life" shows Minnie reading "Lolita." In "Diary," Minnie describes her excitement at provoking desire in adult men in a bar (as well as her revulsion when they respond). She confides the thrill of picking up strangers in Golden Gate Park. And she admits to actively participating in the affair with her mother's boyfriend after he made the first move. Even at her most debased, Minnie sometimes seems to be having fun. As her fellow cartoonist Clowes says: "Phoebe doesn't paint herself as either a hero or as a victim or say that this guy is evil and this guy is good. She's just there in the world as she should be, and you have to interpret the events she depicts." Minnie's complicity doesn't change the fact of her abuse, but it does provide insight into its dynamics. It's a daring subtheme, and it is part of what makes Gloeckner's work ring true, what makes it transcend the genre of most child-abuse memoirs. 
In a way, the European border patrol was onto something -- Gloeckner's cartoons may be devastating, but they can be arousing as well, because that, too, is part of Minnie's experience. The most explicit images threaten to implicate the reader, transforming a sympathetic eye into a voyeuristic one. That quality may be what offends censors and raises red flags among the bookstore buyers who won't carry her work. "Maybe it is titillating," Gloeckner admits. "It can be titillating for the child in a way. But it's also confusing, destructive and horrifying and can be rape and everything else. So to draw things as either black or white is a lie. Because that titillation is in you. I'm not saying it's good, but it's there."
Even so, Gloeckner remains ambivalent, veering in our conversations between self-righteousness and embarrassment, between dreaming of a larger audience and hoping no one she knows will ever see her books. When asked what her suburban neighbors think of her comics, she laughs. "I just tell them I'm a medical illustrator," Gloeckner says. "I don't think they would let their children play with my children if they knew what I drew."
Of course, she's telling this to a reporter from The New York Times, which has a substantial circulation on Long Island. Chances are she's about to be outed. "I know, I know," she groans. "But I haven't lived there that long and I don't know anyone really well. . . . " She trails off for a moment, snared in her own loopy logic. "Well, I don't know how many people will recognize my name," she concludes, weakly. "So I think it's not going to be that bad."
There was no great epiphany, no moment of being scared straight, no hitting bottom, despite how low she sank. Hers was an incremental awakening. At 17, Gloeckner was still prowling Polk Street, shoplifting on the side. She remembers thinking that in another year, if she were caught, she could be jailed, and that scared her. Then there was her grandmother, a doctor back in Philadelphia, whom Gloeckner admired and wanted to emulate. Instead, she seemed to be taking after her father, who had become irretrievably lost in drug and alcohol addiction. And Gloeckner knew she had a gift; even at her lowest ebb, she drew comics on paper bags or in her diary. "They weren't very good, but they sustained me," she says. "I felt good about that part of myself -- and only that part of myself -- but it was something I could feel good about. It made me feel there was some hope that I could do something if I tried." 
She managed to squeak through what she describes as a "school for incorrigibles" and did well enough on her SAT's to enroll at San Francisco State. "I don't know exactly how I made that leap back to normal life," she says. "I wish I did. I suppose that even though I got kicked out of all those private schools, they had given me a sense that there was something else to strive for. Other kids I knew didn't have that." 
Eventually, Gloeckner studied art and medicine, earning a master's in medical illustration. It's a career that suits an artist as meticulous as she. ("It's really hard for me not to fill up every space with crosshatching," she jokes.) But more than that, it's the perfect day job for a person compelled to make the hidden visible, then present it for public display. "I was always aware that the interior was as much a part of my body as the exterior," she says. "I've always done things like try to imagine what it looks like inside when I'm swallowing. Or what it looks like inside when you have sex. So I wanted to understand the interior better. I guess interior life in general."
There is a triptych of Minnie in "a child's Life." In the first drawing, she is eating candy dots, those bits of colored sugar peeled from strips of paper, and looking up at a chevron of migrating birds. In the next, which faces it, she holds a Tootsie Pop. Both are archetypal images of childhood. But turn the page and "Little Minnie" is about to kiss a grown woman, her mouth wet and open, her eyes glazed in anticipation. Is Minnie a child or an adult? Innocent or carnal? "That adult woman is me," Gloeckner says. "I was having a hard time doing the book. I was really nervous about it. So I thought: 'How do I feel about this little girl? Well, I like her, and I want to tell this story for her sake. And I just have to look at it that way and not worry about what people will say.' So that picture is supposed to be me as an adult kissing Minnie. In a sense, it's myself kissing myself. And there is something sexual about it because we're blending in my brain. So I could see that people would interpret it differently." She shrugs. "But that's O.K." 
It may be that you have to be 40 before you can reconcile with 14, before you can reach back in time and offer a consoling embrace. Gloeckner imagines teenage girls would be the natural audience for her work if it were more readily available in conventional bookstores. But for the most part, it doesn't cross their paths. Even so, the dedication of "Diary of a Teenage Girl" reads, "For the girls after they've grown." 
"Although I was exposed to all those things when I was a kid, I don't think everyone should be, even through a book," she says. "So the dedication is hopeful in that sense. It is for girls, but let them stay as ignorant as they can be of these things until they're stronger or know more. Unless, of course, they're forced to grow up too soon."

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
T.W.A. Is Slowly Nudged Into Aviation History

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
IN late June, a Trans World Airlines jet rolled out of a hangar in Kansas City, Mo., with a new look. Gone was the red, gold, blue and white of T.W.A.'s old paint scheme. In its place was a polished aluminum fuselage with red, white and blue stripes along its length.
 Apart from the T.W.A. decals on the tail and near the nose, the plane looked as if it belonged to American Airlines. And that was the point. Since AMR Corporation, American's parent, bought T.W.A. in a bankruptcy sale in April for $742 million, it has been working on a grand plan to integrate the two airlines with the least disruption possible. The new design was the latest and most visible sign of many coming changes. 
 Airline mergers are notoriously messy -- as well as expensive -- and the combination of American and T.W.A. will be the biggest in history. When the job is done, American will have 130,000 employees and 900 aircraft, making it the world's largest airline (United previously held that position).
But before that can happen there are literally hundreds of things that need to be changed, from replacing the food carts on T.W.A.'s airplanes to aligning maintenance schedules to standardizing the cockpits. 
American knows how badly things can go wrong. After it bought tiny Reno Air in 1998, its pilots charged that the company had violated their contract and staged an extensive sickout that forced American to cancel thousands of flights.
To avoid disruption, American has adopted a go-slow approach. It has opened its airport clubs to T.W.A. club members and begun moving T.W.A. and American ticket counters and other operations next to each other at some airports. But American estimates that it will be two years or more before T.W.A. is fully integrated. Until then, T.W.A. will operate as a separate airline.
So far, American has received high marks from industry analysts for the way it has handled the process. "They seem to be putting it together pretty well," said Terry Trippler, who follows the airlines from Minneapolis for the Web site OneTravel.com. 
But Mr. Trippler and others say the difficult hurdles are still to come. Perhaps the biggest is scheduled for early December, when American plans to move T.W.A. to the Sabre computer reservation system. Until then, the two airlines cannot really combine schedules or trade in-depth information about passengers because T.W.A. uses a rival system, WorldSpan. 
Three years ago US Airways switched to the Sabre system after months of training. But after the switch was flipped, passengers were still inconvenienced by foulups that were not completely ironed out for months.
Another challenge will be how unions at the two carriers integrate their members. The pay and schedules of pilots and flight attendants are determined by seniority, which a merger can affect. The unions representing the pilots, attendants and mechanics at American gave their blessings to the merger, but they must work out integration schemes with their T.W.A. counterparts.
As these changes happen, T.W.A.'s identity, forged over 76 years, is slowly disappearing. American said it would complete the makeover of T.W.A.'s fleet of 160 planes by April. The new design makes it easy to replace the T.W.A. decal with the familiar AA logo on the tail and "American" near the nose after the interiors and cockpits are converted to American's specifications. American has said that by fall it will have removed seats in all T.W.A. jets to offer the same expanded legroom in economy class now found on American aircraft. 
T.W.A. flights are already circulating the American in-flight magazine and on July 1, they switched over to American's in-flight movies -- an improvement for T.W.A. passengers because American changes its movies twice a month while the cash-strapped T.W.A. was on a monthly schedule.
The two airlines' schedules remain largely unchanged. One of the biggest areas of overlap is in the Caribbean. T.W.A. cut service from Miami, Aruba and the Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico, routes already served by American. It also ended a daily flight from Kennedy Airport to Puerto Rico, leaving 10 daily by the two airlines. T.W.A. also eliminated one of its five daily flights from Boston to Puerto Rico but added one from Boston to the Dominican Republic.
American has not yet decided what changes it will make at T.W.A.'s hub in St. Louis. Because T.W.A. operated only one hub, the airport was congested. Most experts believe that American will reconfigure the schedule and use St. Louis to relieve pressure on its hubs in Chicago and Dallas. 
One thing T.W.A. passengers do not have to worry about is their frequent flier miles. While T.W.A. Aviators miles cannot be used for American flights, T.W.A. passengers can choose to get American AAdvantage miles from T.W.A. flights. Holders of American miles can use them for T.W.A. flights. 
American plans to end the Aviators program Nov. 30. After that, all outstanding Aviators miles will become AAdvantage miles. "The bottom line we give to the Aviators members is your miles are safe," said Mark Abels, a T.W.A. spokesman.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 8-5-01; 
Out of Retirement

BYLINE:  By Nelson W. Aldrich Jr.; Nelson W. Aldrich Jr. is the author of "Old Money" and a contributing editor at Worth magazine.

 BODY:
I was brooding about money the other day, when it occurred to me that my friends and I, most of us in (let's call it) upper upper-middle-age, are being remarkably stoical about our nest eggs now rotting away in the stock market. Other vicissitudes of aging get us going volubly enough, in a way I fear we'll soon find pathetically inadequate to the occasion. But the stock market's blow to our retirement security seems to have left us unmoved.
 Maybe the implications haven't sunk in. There hasn't been much about it in the newspapers and magazines I read, despite the revelation, last month, that in 2000 the average 401(k) lost money for the first time in its history. The columnists seem more concerned with gauging the depth and duration of the slump than with its consequences for upper upper-middles. 
 Surely this is a journalistic mistake: my age group is not very large, but in matters of retirement, we're the canaries for vast multitudes of aging baby boomers. We and they, 40 million of us, presumably invested great hope for retirement in 401(k)'s -- and so, too, has President Bush, who is counting on 401(k)-like plans to privatize responsibility for Social Security. But if the president or the people were frightened or enraged by the downturn or drew any conclusions with respect to their retirement policies, it didn't show.
My friends may not have understood the implications either. "What do you expect?" my old college roommate growled. "Market goes up, market goes down. Nothing to get exercised about." Well, I could think of something: the upper upper-middle-aged might croak before the market recoups our losses.
I hadn't the wit to point this out at the time, but I'm not sure it would have mattered if I had. Our wealth group corresponds roughly to our age group: upper-upper middle. Perhaps he thinks we've got enough savings to save our retirement from a mere slump. Except he's too smart to believe that. In America, only monks possess a firm sense of "enough." For the rest of us, it's always just out of reach, like the grapes of Tantalus.
Most likely, my old pal is just blase. This country delights in keeping even its more comfortable citizens insecure -- motivated," the economists say -- and one of the ways it has done so since even before the arrival of 401(k)'s is by wiring our sensoriums to the pacemaker on Wall Street. Thus a certain sprezzatura in the face of its sickening irregularities may reflect long experience, as well as a good supply of ideological Dramamine. Losses, we know, are hardly worth talking about except as cases in point of the risks they run, which justify the rewards.
Until the news came out, I never cared much about the fate of my retirement funds. Why should I? I intended never to retire. At reunions and suchlike events, when people asked me what I was doing, I'd say: "Working. Can't stop." My voice betrayed a little pride, I'm sure, and a little pity for the friends who asked. Many are already retired, some (you can never tell who) unwillingly. These days, the corporate guardians of our livelihoods are shoving off the middle-aged, never mind the upper upper-middles. I have been sent up that creek myself.
But luckily I've always found a paddle. I love work. I love it for all the good things we have been told to expect from work: freedom, autonomy, identity, purpose, discipline, respect and self-respect. It braces my character, which needs bracing as much as any exile from welfare-as-we-knew-it. It gives me surcease from self-consciousness, morbid in my case. (I'm not going gently into the next stretch of creek after this, damn it; without work, I'd be there already.)
I suspect that many people expect to go on working if they can. I hear it from my children's generation. "I don't plan to retire," they say. "Besides, Social Security will be such a pittance by then, I won't be able to." Yet pride is there, too, the can-do entrepreneurial spirit.
But the news about the 401(k)'s has got me nervous. I'm delighted if it foils the plot to securitize Social Security, which strikes me as yet another instance of our becoming like post-Soviet Russia -- tearing apart our common wealth to enrich our corporate oligarchs and liberating the rest of us, as someone once said, to go sleep under a bridge. Personally, though, what the 401(k) slump does is wake me up to the false consciousness that work is the great thing I wanted to do in my sunset years. This is macho nonsense. I've been suckered by the grotesquely high moral, therapeutic and social value this country puts on work. In my case, anyway, none of the aforementioned virtues are relevant. It's too late to brace my character further. There are better ways than work to deny death. And my sort of work is too badly paid to make up for my savings shortfall.
But the worst part of my vanishing retirement, I see now, is that my work always had quotation marks around it, invisible to me. It somehow feels different to imagine that I won't be taken care of, that I work because I have to, not just because I want to. How will it feel now that it's for real and earnest, my cocktail party claim that I'm working, now that events have called me on it? Not good, I imagine.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Kensington; 
An Old Neighborhood Is Rediscovered

BYLINE:  By JOYCE COHEN 

 BODY:
UNTIL they drove by the house they ended up buying -- it had a wraparound porch and five stained-glass windows -- Christopher James Quinn and his wife, Nanette Fuentes, were only dimly aware of Kensington's existence. They visited the house many times, bought it in March 2000, renovated it top to bottom and grew fond of their little-known neighborhood on the far side of Prospect Park.
 "Can't stop talking about Kensington!" Mr. Quinn said. "The area has some rough edges but is so obviously on the upswing that it's exhilarating." 
 The neighborhood remains solidly middle class, though the Italian and Irish immigrant families from a generation ago are giving way to those from around the world, as well as to New Yorkers moving farther into Brooklyn as they uncover the more affordable homes there. 
"Two new homeowners within two houses have moved in," Mr. Quinn said. "We've met lots of young couples, and there is this energy about the area, with people settling here for good."
Mr. Quinn, who does computer work for the city's Department of Transportation when he is not acting -- his small part in "The Sopranos" was featured in the promos for the series' first season -- said he and his wife had received a warm welcome. "Building the porch railing was a great way to meet many new neighbors -- as they passed by, they cheered us on," he said. "We've become good friends with the people across the street, a family from Trinidad. He's a plumber who did some work for me and wouldn't take money. When his computer breaks, I go over and fix it."
Mr. Quinn and Ms. Fuentes, who works in the development office at Long Island University, own a detached single-family house with a yard, driveway and garage. Across the street are attached row houses. The mix of styles is typical of Kensington, where rows of brick or brownstone homes face larger detached homes. Many houses have been remodeled, some with enclosed or bricked-in porches, fake flagstone facades, high fences and other details that do not always fit the rest of the home. A few yards are landscaped with topiary and flowers while others are decorated with lawn ornaments; some are strewn with toys or debris.
"Every house is different," said Mr. Quinn, who added that it was impossible to tell from the outside what awaits inside. "There are a lot of houses that have character and potential."
Houses in Kensington, both attached and detached, tend to be for one or two families. There is also a mix of prewar and postwar apartment houses, five or six stories tall. The rental market includes units in rent-stabilized buildings, co-ops and private homes. 
"Kensington is an old neighborhood," said Marcia J. Miller, owner of Open Options Real Estate, based in neighboring Windsor Terrace. "It is turning around now, and a lot of the properties need renovation. Some blocks are better than others."
Arrivals include "young urban professionals of all nationalities, same-sex couples, young married couples starting a family and religious Jewish people who desire large houses with a lot of bedrooms," she said. "They want to be near the park and want to see trees and flowers. They want to raise their children in a diverse neighborhood. I call it the league of all nations, a real Brooklyn diverse community."
Single-family houses "in a decent area" cluster in a range of $275,000 to $300,000, while two-family houses sell for $350,000 to $450,000, she said. A small home "needing a lot of work" might be $250,000, while a larger home in good condition would be closer to $500,000.
Ms. Miller has seen prices soar over the last two years. "It might be leveling off a little bit now but is still very much in demand," she said. Houses sell quickly. A month ago, she put a two-family house on an established block up for sale. "We put a sign on it and listed it in two papers, and we're going crazy," she said. "I got 33 calls the first weekend." The house, now in contract, sold for its full asking price, $449,950.
Rental prices have also climbed. "We have a newly renovated two-bedroom-plus-den in a limestone building, and the rent is $1,850," Ms. Miller said. "I can't believe the prices." But not everything is so expensive. "We just rented a two-bedroom in a so-so building for $1,300," she said. One-bedroom apartments rent for about $1,000 on average.
IN one typical postwar midrise building, one-bedroom co-ops are selling for about $45,000, while those with two bedrooms are going for about $65,000. But many of Kensington's more luxurious co-ops are in the large prewar buildings that line the grand and graceful Ocean Parkway.There, one-bedroom co-ops sell for $90,000 to $140,000, and two-bedroom units go for $110,000 to $175,000.
"Our prices had been pretty low, so we had room to grow," said Merrie Melman, who sells apartments in her Ocean Parkway building and elsewhere in the area. Ocean Parkway's apartments are "huge," Ms. Melman said, with large rooms and spacious closets. The coveted three-bedroom, two-bathroom units sell for about $250,000.
"We are getting a big exodus from Park Slope, which has prices comparable to Manhattan, and also from Windsor Terrace," Ms. Melman said. "Kensington is being discovered. The area is just jumping now."
It was price that brought Mr. Quinn and Ms. Fuentes to Kensington. They had been living in Canarsie, where Mr. Quinn grew up, and looked at first for a home in Windsor Terrace. But all they found were small row houses they did not like and could not afford. 
"I grew up in a detached house, and my wife grew up in a Manhattan apartment," Mr. Quinn said. "She loved the idea of having a house and a yard. But the first house we saw in Windsor Terrace was a three-quarter family house -- it was so small, it felt claustrophobic. We were wildly depressed by that but then started seeing biggish houses in Kensington in our price range. We bought this house thinking the block had great potential for quality of life, but we didn't have to wait for it to be a nice place to live. We realized it was there already." 
Kensington, originally settled by Dutch farmers, was once part of Flatbush, one of Brooklyn's six towns. Development started in 1851. Ocean Parkway, finished in 1876, forms a lush promenade, with its central drive, landscaped malls, benches, chess tables and paths for walking and biking.
Around the turn of the century, Kensington was named after the borough in West London. Home building started in earnest during the 1920's, attracting Irish and Italian immigrants. By the early 1980's, as the original immigrants died or moved away, the melting pot grew to include people from Asia, Europe, South and Central America and Russia, as well as Orthodox Jews. Conversations overheard on the street are seldom in English. 
"It wasn't a place where people stayed -- it was a place to get started," said Michael Consiglio, a neurologist who lived in his family's Kensington house for nearly 60 years and moved to Long Island just a few years ago after he was married. His grandparents were Sicilian immigrants.
"That's what's happening all over again," he said. "There are other nationalities coming to the area. They have gone from tenements to multiperson dwellings and own detached houses for the first time, so it's wonderful for them. Though the area is now ethnically mixed, the people are economically similar -- hard-working immigrants."
The cultural diversity was a draw for Paul Campbell, a visual artist, and his wife, Susan Campbell, an occupational therapist. Seven years ago, they moved from a loft in Williamsburg to a four-story detached house in Kensington. They have a yard, a driveway and a garage. 
"We really love living here," Mr. Campbell said. "Before we bought the house, I watched the kids getting out of school and have never seen such a diverse group of people waiting for their kids. That was something really appealing to us about the neighborhood."
Still, he said, "the flip side of the ethnically mixed neighborhood is the ethnic groups don't mix as much as one would like. Everybody seems to coexist peacefully and amicably, but apart from religious organizations there don't seem to be common meeting places, like art galleries, bars, cafes and restaurants."
THE Campbells moved, in part, for the school district. Many of Kensington's children attend P.S. 130 or P.S. 230, both in Community School District 15. Those living in the southernmost part of Kensington attend P.S. 179, in District 20. All three schools have programs for the gifted. The area has two parochial schools, Immaculate Heart of Mary and St. Rose of Lima, both with about 250 children in prekindergarten through eighth grade.
The New Kensington Neighborhood Association keeps an eye on quality-of-life issues, especially those that affect the elderly. The group pushed for smooth curb cuts and traffic signs along Ocean Parkway, one of the city's busiest thoroughfares.
The main shopping street is Church Avenue, which Mr. Campbell called "basic but not upscale." There are several supermarkets and chain drugstores, plus dozens of ethnic grocery stores and restaurants. McDonald Avenue is filled with Pakistani restaurants. Another commercial strip, Ditmas Avenue, has a branch of the Brooklyn Public Library.
Near Prospect Park, a takeout shop for ice cream and Italian ices -- Uncle Luigi's, on the border of Kensington and Windsor Terrace -- brings upscale foot traffic to a dingy stretch of Coney Island Avenue. Another nearby draw is Kensington Stables, which occupies a low-slung red barn as well as "the little gray barn" across the street. An hourlong trail ride in Prospect Park costs $25. An urban pony ride -- up and down the block -- is $2.

Two tiny, one-block streets at the edge of Green-Wood Cemetery were later named Bill's Place and Micieli Place. Map of Brooklyn highlighting Kensington.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION/RADIO; 
A Chance to See 'Salesman' as if for the First Time

BYLINE:  By JULIE SALAMON 

 BODY:
WHEN CBS first broadcast "Death of a Salesman" in 1966, critics hoped its substantial ratings might ignite a new golden age of television. "The little box in the parlor suddenly stopped its raucous babbling and spoke with power and beauty," Jack Gould wrote in The New York Times. "The public response to the superb interpretation of the tragedy of Willy Loman could not have been more heartening."
 But "Bonanza" drew an even bigger audience that night. And television's raucous babbling has only amplified since. "Death of a Salesman" endures, however, and now audiences can once again watch the transcendent performances of Lee J. Cobb and Mildred Dunnock, who were recreating their original Broadway roles. 
 Last shown on television in 1973, the CBS production of the 1949 Arthur Miller play will become available today on videocassette through www.broadwayarchive.com and at some retail stores. On Sept. 30 it will be shown on Trio, a digital cable and satellite television channel owned by USA Networks, and it has been licensed by many PBS stations for later broadcasts.
The days of theater as a big television event are gone. (Indeed, the days of big television are gone: few shows of any kind command audiences of more than 20 million people, the number who watched "Death of a Salesman" on CBS 35 years ago.) Cable channels like Showtime and HBO occasionally offer theater pieces (including Brian Dennehy's powerful portrayal of Willy Loman in Showtime's filmed presentation last year). PBS continues to be an important source of televised theater through "PBS Hollywood Presents" from KCET, "Stage on Screen" from Thirteen/WNET and "ExxonMobil Masterpiece Theater's American Collection" from WGBH. ABC and CBS still dabble in theatrical productions, but stick to crowd-pleasers like "South Pacific" and "On Golden Pond" -- the networks have lost both the power and the will to foist high culture on the mass audience. "Death of a Salesman" in any form can't touch the public consciousness like "Survivor" or "The Sopranos." This revival of the old CBS production demonstrates the opportunities opened up by technology. People who love theater have new ways to find it.
For Basil Hero, the release of "Death of a Salesman" is a significant marker in his quest to find Broadway productions that were adapted for television and to restore the aging films and tapes using digital technology. The co-founder and president of Broadway Theater Archive, which is releasing "Death of a Salesman," Mr. Hero has spent several years trying to renovate and distribute hundreds of televised theater productions hidden primarily in public television archives. He obtained the cooperation of two major public television stations, KCET in Los Angeles and WNET in New York, and financing from Michael Fuchs, former chairman of HBO, and Chase Mishkin, a Broadway producer.
There was vast material to choose from, including "A Moon for the Misbegotten" with Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst (1975), "King Lear" with James Earl Jones, Raul Julia and Paul Sorvino (1974) and "The Iceman Cometh' with Jason Robards and Robert Redford (1960). These are among the 85 titles currently available through Broadway Theater Archive; about 60 more will be available soon.
Besides the expensive and delicate process of restoring the master tapes, many of which were quite fragile, there were legal hurdles to overcome. "The $64,000 question hanging over the operation was, would we get the cooperation of the writers and agents of the works?" Mr. Hero said. The rights he wanted most were those for the 1966 version of "Death of a Salesman," a work Mr. Hero, now 46, remembers reciting line by line as a teenager. He couldn't stop himself from quoting the play during an interview. "You can't eat the orange and throw away the peel," he said. "A man isn't a piece of fruit."
Television's interest in serious theater, which had been strong in the medium's early years, was revived in the mid-1960's by David Susskind, who produced a series of drama programs, with playwrights themselves shaping the television adaptations. Tennessee Williams approved cuts for "The Glass Menagerie." Arthur Miller wrote the television versions of both "Death of a Salesman" and "The Crucible."
Despite his cooperation back then, Mr. Miller was reluctant to have the CBS production exhumed. "Frankly, that production we're talking about is a condensed version and that bothers me a lot," Mr. Miller said in an interview. "However, there's a lot of very good acting going on in it and it will reach a lot of people, so I can't complain. But I would much rather have people see the whole thing, which is what Brian Dennehy did." The Dennehy version is not available on video, though Dustin Hoffman's idiosyncratic 1984 Broadway rendition, which was also shown by CBS, is.
Mr. Miller said he was persuaded because, while he has admired subsequent productions of the play, none of them have evoked the emotion he felt in 1949, watching his written characters emerge as flesh and blood. "The first one is the most passionately felt because that's the one when you discover the play, and after that you're basically playing with that discovery, so it's a different set of feelings," he said. "It's a bit like the first time you have a child. The following children are terrific, but it's not quite the same miracle as the first time."
So despite his reservations about the abbreviated CBS version, Mr. Miller decided its value outweighed his objections. "Anything with Lee in it, that really swung it for me," he said. "I thought other actors might want to see what he was like and that's the only chance they're going to get."
What a gift this is. Far removed from their historic context, the play's themes and these performances remain amazingly alive. Mr. Cobb's exquisite rendering of Willy remains a touchstone for the character. In this bearish man you see Willy's monumental self-deception, but also the sweet dreaminess and sexual force that explain why his wife, Linda, loves him despite everything. Linda could seem like a sap for defending the contradictory and foolish Willy at their children's expense. But Mildred Dunning conveys the necessity of her self-delusion with heartbreaking clarity. If she doesn't believe in Willy, what has her life been?
The shattering effects of Willy's flawed dream should resonate today, with young dot-commers or "old economy" employees who have been laid off, bought out or otherwise downsized. "Things are worse now, from what I've heard," Mr. Miller said. "There is no corporate personality at all. When you lose whatever value you have for the company, you go. At least Willy has a very hot argument with his late boss's son. Now there's probably no argument. Just turn off the light."
Critics continually reevaluate the play, analyzing whether it is a dated piece of social realism or a timeless psychological drama. But Mr. Miller's attitude toward Willy Loman has remained constant for more than a half century. "My feelings haven't changed that much, to tell the truth," he said. "I feel that Willy is foolish and he's wonderful and a terribly human person. I felt that, way back, and I still do."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 19, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 5 about the 1966 television adaptation of "Death of a Salesman" used an incorrect surname at one point for the actress who played Willy Loman's wife, Linda. She was Mildred Dunnock, not Dunning.

HEADLINE: DANCE; 
Guru in an Outpost Of Ballet Wisdom

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH CARMAN; Joseph Carman, a former dancer with American Ballet Theater, writes about dance.

DATELINE: CARLISLE, Pa. 

 BODY:
LONDON, Paris, St. Petersburg and New York are well known for their first-rate ballet academies, training many of the best dancers in the classical form. Add to that list Carlisle, Pa., a town with fewer than 20,000 people and a modest economy driven by state government jobs and the defense industry.
 For the last 46 years, Marcia Dale Weary and her Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet have produced dancers well known in the ballet world. Sean Lavery, Tina LeBlanc, Deborah Wingert, Lisa de Ribere and Ethan Stiefel are just a few of Ms. Weary's former students. When artistic directors hear that a dancer has been trained by Ms. Weary, they prick up their ears and sometimes even make the pilgrimage here to recruit the prospect themselves. 
 At a gala performance at the Sunoco Performance Theater in Harrisburg last month, Ms. Weary invited an array of her illustrious alumni back home to dance excerpts from the classical and neo-classical repertory. Among those dancing were Ashley Bouder, Adam Hendrickson and Ryan Kelly from New York City Ballet; Kristin Long and Vanessa Zahorian, stars of San Francisco Ballet; and Adrienne Schulte from American Ballet Theater. 
There were sibling teams as well: Ms. LeBlanc and her sister, Sherri LeBlanc, from San Francisco Ballet; Abi and Jonathan Stafford from New York City Ballet; and Tara and Zachary Hench, soloists with Boston Ballet and San Francisco Ballet, respectively. The selections ranged from standards like "The Sleeping Beauty" and "Don Quixote" to Balanchine works like "Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux" and his seldom seen "Pavane."
Assembling the dancers was an emotional as well as artistic challenge. Most of the dancers, who consider themselves a big family but come from all over, had trained together with Ms. Weary since they were toddlers, recipients of what they call Ms. Weary's "daily medicine," a combination of rigorous discipline and practice of the language of ballet.
A majority of the students, ages 4 to 19, live in central Pennsylvania, and those who can't commute stay in dormitories at Dickinson College or in private homes. Students are required to attend at least 15 ballet classes each week. (A grant from the General Mills Foundation now provides scholarships for children from low-income families.)
"We're grooming for the professional world," said Darla Hoover, a former New York City Ballet dancer who is now Ms. Weary's associate director.
Mr. Stafford agreed: "The training really set us up for being in a company. You work from 10:30 in the morning to 10:30 at night, especially at New York City Ballet."
Although Ms. Weary clearly commands respect ("She would scare the living daylights out of us," said Ms. LeBlanc, a principal ballerina in San Francisco), she is not the cane-wielding taskmaster one might expect. At just over five feet tall with soft bangs, a softer voice and a touch of Southern gentility cultivated in her youth in Alabama, Ms. Weary has a childlike quality that belies her tough-love attitude toward teaching.
She opened her school in 1955, after studying in New York with Thalia Mara and attending seminars by George Balanchine. She realized that at the age of 19 it was too late for a career as a dancer, but she was determined to teach and so opened the school. In the beginning, she said, "it was trial and error."
"I didn't have wonderful bodies, like at the School of American Ballet," Ms. Weary said. "You have to figure out a way to make children who don't have good bodies look good. And that makes you think and work to develop ways of breaking things down for children. We still do that." 
Teaching children how to concentrate is paramount, she said, particularly at a time when children's attention spans have, by her account, grown disturbingly shorter. "A 7-year-old is like a 4-year-old was 30 years ago," Ms. Weary said. In class, she added, "I expect them to pay attention all the time, and after six months or a year, most of them have learned how to focus. They're not afraid of me, but they kind of are."
Ms. Weary keeps class work simple, often repeating the same lesson for a month until the students get it right. The method is effective, said Ms. Wingert, a New York City Ballet alumnus who frequently teaches at the school. "With that kind of repetition, you don't have to think," she said. "Tendu is just tendu."
Although the school has expanded to include a larger complex called "the Warehouse," containing six ample, climate-controlled studios with sprung wood floors to accommodate 560 summer session students, Ms. Weary prefers to work in the Barn, a renovated farm shelter that houses three small studios. There, she teaches the newest generation of 5-year-old ballerinas with names like Chloe, Tiffany and Allegra. In her mid-60's, Ms. Weary will get down on her hands and knees to help a child stretch her leg or articulate her feet. 
"In many ways, Marcia lives in her own time," said Ms. Hoover. "Her refusal to give up any of her values -- she never lessens them -- and what she imparts to her students haven't changed since I was 6."
Ms. LeBlanc added: "We knew that Marcia was a little eccentric. She's her own person and does things her way, and that was just accepted." (Ms. Weary's swift, steely glare at an established ballerina can instantly signal that she is breaking the school's dress code.)
In keeping with her aim to prepare dancers for professional companies, Ms. Weary does not advocate any one style of dancing over another. Her guest faculty, in addition to former students, includes ballet teachers from Cuba, Paris, Russia and New York. "That way you can be a chameleon," Ms. Wingert said. "You can absorb different styles." Ms. Zahorian, now a soloist with San Francisco Ballet, added: "She had us watch videotapes of Russian ballets, Balanchine works -- Cecchetti to Bournonville. It broadens your knowledge of dance."
Ms. Weary insists that Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet is more a training ground than a company. Still, the group performs four times a year and is a member of the Northeast Regional Ballet Association. Alan Hineline has been engaged as a resident choreographer to produce classical works for the age group, and the dancers regularly perform full-length classical ballets. There is also a solid relationship with the Balanchine Trust, which has granted the company rights to many of its ballets. "They know the quality of dancers down here, so they don't usually flinch," Ms. Hoover said. "They know they can handle anything."
What is the secret to Ms. Weary's success? "I'm close enough to New York and yet far enough away that they just can't go running off to New York," Ms. Weary said of her students. "You can make the rules and they find out that the rules work."
Ms. Wingert said the demand for perfection is the key: "Marcia once said to me that you are only as good as your worst student." But to Ms. Le Blanc, elements of Ms. Weary's formula remain a mystery. "I still look at this lady and think, 'How does she do it?' " she said. "I still don't get it."

Available Office Space Jumps in Fairfield County

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
THE availability rate for office space in Fairfield County has almost doubled in the last year, Stamford real estate companies say, adding that the jump is the most dramatic rise in a decade.
 Of the almost 44 million square feet of office space across the county's 627 square miles, 4.4 million square feet are vacant, up from 2.5 million square feet at this time last year, plus or minus some footage depending on variations in statistics compiled by the individual companies. 
 But executives of those companies are qualifying the statistics by saying that the news is not all that bad. The increase follows a year when the market was so overheated that bidding wars were commonplace.
The jump reflects a slowdown in leasing and a rise in subleasing and is regarded by brokers as manageable, at least for now. As long as downsizing tenants continue to pay rent, make buyout deals with their landlords or sublease space when they need to dispose of disused square footage, brokers believe the office market will ride out this choppy economic sea. 
"The key is layoffs," said James Fagan, senior managing director of suburban real estate at CB Richard Ellis. "Right now, people want to see how things shake out before committing leasing dollars. If a lot of layoffs continue to hit the market, you'll see less of a need for office space."
Jeffrey Dunne, a senior vice president at CB Richard Ellis, added: "People are exaggerating the dovetailing of two things: businesses contracting and the summer doldrums. They are overstating the negative this year because the market was so strong in 2000." But, Mr. Dunne said, "I don't think we're at the end yet." 
Noting that the investment market was still strong, he said, "we're selling about $100 million worth in Fairfield and Westchester, from 50,000 to 200,000 square feet, all 95 percent occupied."
Older buildings along Stamford's Summer Street, north of the business district, are having more difficulty and are less likely to recover as quickly as their more desirably located downtown counterparts, brokers say. Among them is 707 Summer Street, with its 75,000 square feet fully leased to the Cendant Corporation for one more year. Cendant had been leasing four Stamford buildings.
After three leases expired, it consolidated at 100 Connecticut Avenue in Norwalk three months ago. The Summer Street building, owned by the Hoffman Brothers, Stamford developers, is up for sale, "to relieve ourselves of the taxes," said Steven Hoffman. It is being marketed for subleasing to reduce some of Cendant's remaining lease obligation, he added.
Members of a focus group of 22 top executives of area companies brought together by Christopher P. Bruhl, executive director of the Southwestern (Connecticut) Area Commerce and Industry Association in Stamford, reported that the demand for temporary staffing, an economic indicator, was down countywide, and that the pace of business was slower than last year. But the group members said they expected solid growth by this year's fourth quarter or the first quarter of 2002.
"There are no cash-flow problems," Mr. Bruhl said, "no credit crunch, no loans being called by banks. Consumer confidence is supporting restaurants and service businesses. In retail, higher-priced sales are being made by fewer people. It's too soon to know if it's seasonal, value-oriented or driven by high-income customers."
According to statistics compiled by the association, unemployment in the county rose to 2.3 percent this year from 2.1 percent last year, representing 10,064 people of 447,138 countywide. How much of the total was office staff is not clear.
"There is no panic," said Kenneth M. Krasnow, regional managing director at Cushman & Wakefield. "We are not seeing rents go down. That's because a large portion of the space that's come back is sublet, not directly affecting most landlords. Landlords are protected with guarantees and security on a lot of these deals because they had the leverage to ask for what they wanted when they had people vying for the space."
STAMFORD asking rents averaging $25.50 a square foot annually last year have climbed to $36.75 this year, but countywide averages declined marginally in the second quarter to $31.38 from $31.65.
W & M Properties of Stamford and Manhattan, like other landlords, limits vacancies by leasing or renewing leases up to two years in advance. In today's market, it is negotiating buyout agreements with tenants with excess space. Information Resources, at W & M's Merritt View in Norwalk since 1996, paid $100,000 to be let out of 11,000 square feet of its total of almost 50,000 square feet. 
"It would have cost them more," said Jeffrey Newman, executive vice president of W & M Properties, "to pay commission on a sublease for the remainder of the lease, plus retrofitting the space and having to take a shortfall in rent from the $33 a square foot they are paying to the $27 or $28 they would be able to charge in a sublease, plus having primary liability if the sublease tenant defaults."
Xerox appears to be the largest potential source of available space. Its 255,000-square-foot headquarters at 800 Long Ridge Road in Stamford, built, owned and occupied by the company since 1978, has been for sale since March 29. "Our opinion is it's best laid out for a single tenant," said Kara Choquette, a spokeswoman for the company. "It can accommodate 630 people, but we employ only half that now, so we are looking for a building half this size." 
The former Champion International building, which became the International Paper building last year and after changing hands again in January is now called 400 Atlantic Street, has 180,000 square feet empty out of 500,000 square feet. "We are talking to people locally and in New York who could be full-floor or smaller users," said Scott Landis, head of the Landis Group, which now owns the building. Asking rents start at $45 a foot and rise to $48 a foot on the third floor, where landscaped outdoor terraces are included in the leases.
Existing tenants include International Paper's world headquarters, with 132,000 square feet on four floors; UBS Warburg, with 75,000 square feet; and Arthur Andersen, with a full floor of 37,000 square feet. New leases include the regional headquarters of the law firm of Wiggin & Dana and the United States headquarters of Abbey National, one of Europe's larger banks. 
Foot-dragging among possible tenants might abate by the time two office buildings under construction in Norwalk are completed. A sixth building of 255,000 square feet at the five-building complex called Merritt Seven on Route 7 will be ready for occupancy next summer. And a 350,000-square-foot building at 3545 Glover Avenue, next to Merritt 7, will be ready in 22 months, said its developer, Carl Kuehner, president of Building and Land Technologies in Norwalk.
Stamford, of course, bears the brunt of the slowdown and the greater amount of available space, jumping to 12.9 percent rate from 6.5 percent last year. Eastern Fairfield County has the lowest availability rate in the county at 8.8 percent, due in part to the preleasing of a 150,000-square-foot building at 4 Enterprise Drive in Shelton and attractive rents around $25 a square foot.
Greenwich continues to command the highest rents in the county, ranging from the low $50's a square foot to the low $70's. But CB Richard Ellis says that the asking rate for space at Greenwich Plaza, an office complex at the Central Greenwich railroad station, just dropped to $69 a square foot from $72. 
SUBLEASE space of 135,000 square feet at Greenwich American Center on King Street, the 605,000-square-foot former headquarters of the American Can Company, is being marketed by Cushman & Wakefield at only $35 a square foot "because of the location in the northwest corner of town, away from the business district," said Jay Hruska, executive director for Cushman & Wakefield in Connecticut. 
Availability in northern Fairfield County rose two percentage points, to 13.4 percent, according to statistics from Insignia/ESG, mostly due to the closing of the Microcast Company, which returned 92,000 square feet to the market at 33 Turner Road in Danbury. 
Dean J. Shapiro, executive director of Insignia/ESG's Connecticut-Westchester operations, said: "I'm not sure we know how much rents have fallen because there hasn't been enough leasing activity. A lot of what we've seen has been renewals. I'm looking for new tenants floating through this market." 
Ed Tonnessen, executive vice president at Albert B. Ashforth Inc., added: "There is no doubt that demand has cooled and vacancies have increased. Couple those factors with the sublet influence and prices are going to depress. But it's not the Nasdaq."

HEADLINE: Housing Shortage Is Alive and Well 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
A LEGISLATIVE commission that studied the affordable housing issue in Connecticut last year concluded that despite laws that make it a lot tougher for towns and cities to reject developers' proposals, there is still a 68,000-unit shortfall of affordable housing in the state. 
 Housing advocates said that the nearly 2,000 units of affordable housing and at least another 5,000 units with rents below market value have been created as a result of the 1989 legislation. They said that although those units have made only a small dent in reducing the overall need, without the law the shortage would be even worse. 
 They said there are many reasons the gains have come so slowly, including the persistent battles waged by many towns and their zoning boards against not only affordable housing, but against any new housing at all. 
Housing advocates, such as the commission's co-chairman, Patrick Flaherty, a Democratic state representative from Coventry, and Jeffrey Freiser, executive director of the Connecticut Housing Coalition, said that only 30 of the state's 169 municipalities are at the 10 percent affordable housing level that allows towns and cities to be exempt from the mandate.
They said some towns are so far from the 10 percent number that it is unlikely they will ever reach it. But they said that when the law was created, the expectation was not that every town reach the 10 percent minimum standard, only that they would be motivated to take some action to lessen the shortage.
"It's not just that towns are so resistant to affordable housing, it's that they are strongly opposed to new housing of any kind that is making our efforts to make significant progress difficult," Mr. Flaherty said. "For the most part I think these towns just don't want to have to pay for the increase in their populations, particularly adding children to their schools systems that could impact taxes."
Mr. Flaherty said he was frustrated by affordable housing opponents who "on one hand say that the affordable housing law is having this devastating impact on their communities because they are being forced to allow so much new housing, but at the same they say the law is not helping to create enough units and isn't working. You can't have it both ways."
Opponents of the law said they are not against affordable housing, just to a mandate they said has not been effective.
"Promoting many of these developments as affordable is misleading at best," said Trumbull First Selectman Kenneth Halaby.
He said his town was making efforts to add "real affordable housing in smaller clusters instead of luxury apartments in massive developments that hurt the town."
Mr. Freiser said the efforts by towns to prevent the housing units hurt the entire state because the lack of housing discourages companies from relocating to Connecticut when they learn their employees cannot afford to live in many parts of the state.
"That was one of the main reasons the law was created in the first place," Mr. Freiser said.
He said that according to the 1990 Census, the last census from which the state's housing numbers are available, nearly half of the total 405,000 renter households lived in either sub-standard conditions or pay rent considered to be excessive.
"Everybody says they want to see more housing provided, but many of the towns just want to do whatever it takes to keep taxes from going up," Mr. Freiser said. "Eventually, the lack of housing is going to seriously impact the state's economy. Maybe that's what it will take for people to realize the lack of housing is a crucial issue."

Making Way for Bigger Ships

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
WITH traffic through the port of New York expected to double by the end of the decade and continue growing, and with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey having voted to accelerate a plan to dredge channels to accommodate a new generation of big ships, the authority is making other changes to speed the flow of cargo across its docks.
 Efficient movement of cargo across the docks and into the economy is essential if New York is to remain the premier port on the East Coast, government officials and private consultants agree. 
 This will require changes in the transportation network, with an emphasis on movement of goods by railroad and water. The increased volume of freight may also provide an opportunity to develop contaminated land known as brownfields near the port. 
Most of what is officially called the port of New York is in New Jersey. The 2,100 acres that constitute the ports of Newark and Elizabeth swarm with activity on a typical day. Giant crablike machines swallow up cargo containers the size of truck trailers and swiftly move them off the dock to waiting rail cars or trailer chassis. 
Ultraconcentrated orange juice from Brazil is diluted with local water at the port, and wallboard is manufactured there as well, using imported gypsum rocks that are ground up and placed between sheets of cardboard.
The Port Authority, which operates the region's major seaport on what were once marshy lands in the two cities, is planning for rapid increases in imports as the region's demand for consumer goods grows and manufacturing increasingly shifts to Asia.
Late in July, the agency voted to spend $2.3 billion to dredge the harbor's channels down to a depth of 50 feet, to accommodate the new class of giant container ship, which can carry 5,000 to 7,000 trailer-size containers, compared with 3,000 to 4,000 on a typical ship now in use. The new ships are expected to be in service by the end of the decade. Failure to accommodate them, agency officials said, would divert the ships to other ports along the Atlantic seaboard, depriving the metropolitan area of the jobs and other economic benefits of trade.
Worse, they said, is the likelihood that the contents of containers unloaded in another port would find their way back to this area by truck, worsening an already choked highway system.
To accommodate increased shipping traffic, the authority is trying to move nonessential warehousing and distribution operations out of the port itself to nearby locations. The result, brokers report, is an increased interest in industrial land close to the port, although most bemoan the scarcity of suitable sites.
This, in turn, has prompted some planning agencies to propose channeling some of this demand to abandoned or underused land that is chemically contaminated but could be adapted for processing freight. Known as brownfields, these sites dot the region, the result of manufacturing and chemical processing. Many are near both the seaport and Newark Airport, which is on the west side of the New Jersey Turnpike.
"A warehouse is a good use for a brownfield," said Ann Strauss-Wieder, a freight and transportation consultant, at a recent conference on the issue at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. "You cap the site with a concrete floor for the warehouse and parking lots outside. The issues are how much it is going to cost to remediate and how long it will take to get permits."
Benjamin Katz, a senior managing director of Insignia/ESG, the real estate services company, said: "I'm bullish on space near the port and the airport as well. Some of those imports need processing, so we are going to see modern, high-bay warehouses. And we may recapture some brownfields, using just the surface for containers."
But some real estate executives are skeptical that large numbers of developers will be willing to invest in sites where the likelihood of turning a profit is unclear. "Brownfields take a long time to bring back into a revenue-producing use," said Irving Weiss, a senior vice president at SBWE, a real estate services company with extensive experience in industrial properties. 
And, he said, municipalities in the area tend to favor office and retail development over industrial projects. In Elizabeth, he said, land near both the seaport and airport -- and the Jersey Gardens shopping mall -- has been rezoned for these more lucrative uses and is unavailable for industrial purposes.
The immediate issue may be dredging shipping channels to accommodate larger ships, but the ships are just a reflection of increased trade, said Richard M. Larrabee, director of the authority's Port Commerce Department. He said that American consumers' seemingly unquenchable thirst for imported goods, as well as changing patterns of trade, are expected to increase the amount of cargo coming through the port.
The big new ships are simply a more economical way to move that river of cargo. The Port Authority estimates that the volume of cargo could rise from the present level of about 2.5 million boxes a year to about 6 million by 2010, and as many as 16 million by 2040.
EVEN at its current level of activity, the port is an economic engine for the region. The Port Authority estimates that ocean trade accounts for $23 billion in economic activity annually and provides, directly or indirectly, jobs for 166,500 workers in the 17-county metropolitan region. Freight growth by 2040 could add as many as 238,000 jobs, the agency said.
Until recently, most goods originating in Asia were sent by ship to ports on the West Coast, notably Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., and cargo intended for sale in the Midwest and on the East Coast was shipped east by train. But, according to Port Authority consultants, the rail leg of the trip could account for more than half the total cost.
Shipment by water is cheaper, and shipping companies are increasingly inclined to send vessels westward through the Suez Canal to markets in Europe and the United states. "We are seeing a significant increase in the amount of cargo coming directly by sea to here," Mr. Larrabee said. "The ships are coming now. And the big ships, which are a response to trade, will be coming soon."
On a recent afternoon the ship Leverkusen Express, which is owned by the Hapag-Lloyd line and based in Bremen, Germany, moved gingerly out of the port in Elizabeth with what appeared to be a full load and with the assistance of a tug.
"That's about the biggest we can handle now," said Robert W. Harley, a supervisor at the terminal. The ship, about 960 feet long, can carry about 4,800 containers. To accommodate the ships that will carry 6,000-plus containers, the port will need, in addition to deeper channels and berths, larger cranes that can reach all the way across the wider ships. 
Because the big ships are so costly, the shipping lines want to keep them moving and reduce the number of ports of call, the Port Authority said. This puts New York in competition with cities like Baltimore, Norfolk, Va., and Halifax, Nova Scotia, to be the hub port for goods intended for the eastern part of North America.
"Over time, container traffic will become more and more concentrated in fewer and fewer ports," the Port Authority said in a report, "Building a 21st Century Port." And because shipping companies want to limit their investments in terminal operations, ports capable of handling the big ships will likely be the destinations for smaller ones as well.
With the Maersk-Sealand ship line signed to a long-term lease and with P&O lines moving in, the Port Authority is rearranging the upland parts of its ports in Newark and Elizabeth. Warehouses covering about 50 acres are being torn down to provide more space for container storage and handling, and a grade-level rail crossing is being converted to an overpass to eliminate traffic jams several times a day.
Even so, the agency's ability to expand operations is limited. There are plans to expand the container port at Howland Hook on the north shore of Staten Island and perhaps add a container port at the Military Ocean Terminal, which the federal government is returning to the city of Bayonne, N.J. There are also studies about reviving the docks in Brooklyn, but transportation difficulties may limit this possibility. 
Port Authority officials have said they would like to move the automobile unloading operations out of the main port area to the Port Reading area of Woodbridge Township, N.J.
Although the auto transport ships are huge, they are not as densely loaded as the container ships and can use shallower channels and berths. "Those ships draw about 35 feet, not 45 like the big container ships, and they would be fine down there," said Daniel Maynard, a government and community relations manager for the Port Authority.
In the meantime, the answer is to keep the containers moving, rather than sitting at the dock for days after being unloaded from a ship, port officials said. "We move 1,300 containers per acre a year," Mr. Larrabee of the Port Authority said. "Singapore does 15,000, although that is a different system." He said the Port Authority is making investments in equipment and systems to increase the port's capacity. "What we need to do is improve to 3,500 containers per acre a year over the next decade," he said.
Given the highly trafficked nature of the streets near the port and the jams on the turnpike, any increase in cargo that puts more trucks on the road will only increase a congestion problem that already costs the regional economy $10 billion a year, Port Authority officials said.
Currently, 87 percent of the cargo unloaded from ships in the port goes out by truck, with only 12 percent by rail and the remainder by other means, including barge.. Rail-car loading facilities are being built close to the docks to increase the use of rail, but several transportation specialists said that CSX and Norfolk Southern, the companies that bought and divided up Conrail, have not been rushing to increase the capacity of their tracks or freight yards. 
Another complication, the specialists add, is pressure from state and local governments to use freight tracks for commuter trains at certain times of the day.
IF, inevitably, there are going to be more shipments by truck, efforts are under way to keep trucks in the vicinity of the port off of public roads. In New Jersey, state transportation officials have begun construction of Portway, a trucks-only route between the port and transportation hubs, such as the CSX's rail yard in Kearney and Norfolk Southern's Croxton terminal in Secaucus. 
The project will use existing roads such as Doremus Avenue in Newark but with upgrades to roadways and the replacement of damaged or partly dismantled bridges to handle containers too heavy to use the highway system in New Jersey.
Containers weighing more than highway load limits must be partially unloaded so they can be shipped. Many planners hope that the same buildings used to unload containers will also be used to add value to the products, by, say, sorting clothing and adding price tags.
The Portway project would include a new lift bridge over the Passaic River -- the Coast Guard insists on such a bridge since it considers the waterway navigable -- and a trucks-only entrance to the turnpike. State officials said the project might be ready by the end of the decade.
A huge increase in container imports would increase pressure to put trucks on the highways because, unlike most railroads, trucks can deliver goods to their final destination. But Port Authority executives are developing plans to rely more on waterways than highways to get the containers out of the port to regional distribution centers.
"We have looked at the way ports in Europe, places like Antwerp and Rotterdam, have handled their distribution," said William E. Ellis, a Port Authority planning manager. "They use their rivers and other waterways as alternatives to trucks."
The agency has developed a plan it calls the Port Inland Distribution Network. The idea is to move containers out of the New York port as quickly as possible by train or barge to regional distribution centers. From these regional centers, the containers would be moved by truck, but the trucks would be operating in less congested areas.
Among the locations being considered for these regional centers are Albany, which would require a barge trip up the Hudson River. Other possible sites include Camden, N.J., Bridgeport or New Haven, Conn., and Fall River, Mass.
The goal, Mr. Ellis said, would be to ship about 40 percent of the containers out of the port by barges with self-loading capabilities and 20 to 30 percent by rail, with the remainder being moved by truck.
Long distance shipments by barge, such as between New York and Boston and Baltimore, have been undertaken by private-sector companies, Mr. Ellis said. Whether shorter distances will prove economical as well has yet to be demonstrated, he said.
The regional distribution plan might help solve another related problem, the pileup of empty containers near the port. The containers are accumulating because the nation imports more than it exports and shippers find it cheaper to buy new containers in Asia than ship the empties back. As a result neighborhoods near the port find themselves facing mountains of containers, sometimes stacked seven high.
The inland distribution system would shift the empty containers closer to places where things are still actually made. Upstate New York has close to a balance of trade, Mr. Ellis said, so empty containers could be used for outgoing loads. "A producer could pick up an empty at Port Albany and use it to ship goods out," he said.
Although the Port Authority, attuned to decades of bistate tensions, is always careful to mention projects in New York as well as New Jersey, New Jersey-based planning officials note that 90 percent of the container traffic in the port comes through Newark and Elizabeth.
John V. Hummer of the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority said that unless brownfields close to the port are developed for warehouse-distribution facilities, highway traffic will grow even worse. "Based on current real estate trends, many of these businesses are choosing to locate on greenfield sites on the fringes of the region where land and development costs are lowest," the agency said in a recent report produced in conjunction with New Jersey Institute of Technology.
THIS raises the prospect of goods being shipped by truck to the southern part of the state or to eastern Pennsylvania for processing, only to return by truck for final sale.
Mr. Hummer said the planning agency had found a site as large as 800 acres in the Kearney area and another of 160 acres along the Hackensack River in the same town. He said the agency is looking into the feasibility of developing the brownfield sites for industrial distribution and processing, including the land's likely value if development is permitted. The land will not be developed, he said, unless it will be worth more than the cost.
Some brokers are advising clients with property near the port to lie low while the market develops. "I have a client with a building in Kearney who asked me what he should do," said Donald Eisen, manager of New Jersey operations for Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate services company.
"My advice to him was to do nothing," he said. "In five to 10 years it will be worth gold."

HEADLINE: Jobs Up Amid Hints Of a Slump 

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
THERE has been mostly good economic news in Westchester in recent months, with the only worrisome notes being a rise in unemployment and an increasing commercial vacancy rate in downtown White Plains.
 Statistics for June show an all-time high in jobs, 428,300, which surpasses the previous record set in December 2000, when the county had 424,500 jobs. In March it had 415,200 jobs. 
 Westchester has now recouped all the jobs lost in the recession of the early 90's, showing an 18 percent growth -- 66,000 jobs -- since the recession's low point of 362,000 jobs in January 1994. Of the jobs recovered, more than 41,800 have been added since January 1998, the county's figures show.
Since June, Westchester jobs jumped 1.6 percent, a growth rate exceeding that of the state and nation for the same period. Frank M. Surdey, a regional economist for the State Department of Labor, said Westchester is one of the top job producers among the 16 metropolitan areas in the state. He noted that the county's job growth rate topped the statewide figure, which increased 1.1 percent over the same time period, as well as the national rate of 0.3 percent.
Yet, unemployment is rising slightly, according to figures from the State Department of Labor. The jobless rate in Westchester for June was 3.1 percent, up from 2.8 percent in May, and Mr. Surdey said, "We're beginning to see some signs of softening."
Manufacturing jobs, for example, were down in June by 500 or 1.4 percent from last June, when there were 35,800 jobs. Finance, insurance and real estate jobs were down to 26,800 in June from 26,900 a year ago.
But construction jobs in June were up to their highest level since 1988, to 26,500 -- 5.2 percent more than last June, Mr. Surdey said. The services job category (health, social, high-tech and business services, and software development) grew to 159,400 -- up 2.6 percent from a year ago.
The commercial vacancy rate in buildings in the central business district of White Plains was 18.9 percent at the end of the second quarter of this year, up from 17.3 percent at the end of the first quarter and 15.1 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2000.
"We always have to keep an eye on what's happening nationally," Mr. Surdey said. "Eventually that affects Westchester and New York City. There is no area that's insulated from an economic slowdown, even though Westchester is performing above state and national levels."

Curative Health Services Posts Break-Even Quarter
Curative Health Services (Nasdaq: CURE) of Hauppauge said Tuesday that its second-quarter revenues edged up slightly to $24 million, compared with $21.6 million in the same quarter last year.
 The company, which operates a national network of 100 wound-care centers in hospitals, reported net income of $10,000. 
 Curative spent $670,000 during the quarter on legal expenses, largely responding to directives from the Justice Department relating to Curative's $37.3 million merger agreement four months ago with Millennium Health, a specialty pharmaceutical distributor in Santa Clara, Calif.
Joseph Feshbach, Curative's chairman, said recent discussions with Justice Department officials had been constructive, although a company spokesman would not elaborate further.
Mr. Feshbach also said he was "cautiously optimistic" that revenues would increase in the next quarter.
He added, "We believe the wound-care business continues the process of stabilization."

For Women, Extra Hazards on the Golf Course

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
THEORETICALLY, it is possible to do business on Long Island and never take a swing at a golf ball. But Christine McInerney wonders why anyone would test the theory.
 Ms. McInerney, a partner in Ruskin, Moscou, Evans & Faltischek, a Mineola law firm, is not exactly neutral on the subject. As the founding president of the Long Island chapter of the Executive Women's Golf Association, she recruits members by tapping the pent-up demand among local businesswomen to get out on the links. 
 "Golf is where business gets done," Ms. McInerney said. "On Long Island in particular, women are largely excluded from that. It just isn't as common for women to play golf. When you go to corporate-sponsored golf outings, you look around, and you just don't see a lot of women." 
Organizations like the Executive Women's Golf Association are trying to change that by allowing women to learn the game and its social niceties in a no-pressure, single-sex setting. And in doing this, they are coming face to face with resistance from country clubs that are apparently not eager to see the old ways change.
Last year, the Long Island chapter Ms. McInerney founded was among the fastest-growing of the national association's 98 chapters, enrolling over 200 members its first year. Nearly 100 more members have joined this year. Another group, the seven-year-old Businesswomen's Golf Association of Long Island, has nearly 400 members.
Nationally, women are heading to golf courses in increasing numbers. About six million women now play, accounting for nearly a quarter of the nation's golfers, according to the National Golf Foundation. 
The influx of women has roiled the tradition-bound world of country clubs, where most business golf is played. Despite some pressure from organizations like the United States Golf Association, many private clubs continue to maintain sex-based policies and practices, a number of women contend. 
Susan Slavin, a civil-rights lawyer and partner in Slavin, Angiulo, & Horowitz, a Jericho law firm, said she has heard from a number of women who complain about how they are treated at Long Island country clubs. "It's appalling," Ms. Slavin said of the "blatantly discriminatory policies and practices" that prevail, she contends, at membership clubs like the Glen Head Country Country Club and the Huntington Crescent Club. 
"The Huntington Crescent Club does not allow women to be members unless they are the daughters of current members," Ms. Slavin said. "And they have a men's grill, where women are not allowed in. The Glen Head Country Club until a few months ago also had a men's grill, where women could not walk in."
At the Glen Head club the grill is now open to members. Ed Closs, the club's general manager, said that three or four of its 235 members were women. "That seems to be how people join," he said. "If a woman wants to join the club, she can do so."
Louis Kerner, the club's president, said: "I think it's an economic issue. I don't think a single woman wants to spend $50,000 to join and pay $20,000 a year membership and not have other women to play golf with." 
John Tangorra, the manager of the Huntington Crescent, did not return three calls seeking comment. 
While many women who play golf say that sex discrimination is waning, some still chafe at inequities. These are their chief complaints:
*They feel unwelcome or are ignored in clubhouse restaurants.
*The best tee times are reserved for men.
*Membership privileges are open only to women who are married to members or are the daughters of members.
Few women will address the discrimination issue publicly for fear of being labeled bad sports and finding doors permanently closed to them or to their husbands or parents.
"Most women won't speak up about this because they're afraid of being ostracized and their husbands ostracized," Ms. Slavin said. In August 1989, Ms. Slavin filed a discrimination charge with the New York State division of human rights on behalf of Nancy Saunders, a real estate broker who joined a Westchester country club where she intended to entertain business clients. In her complaint Ms. Slavin alleged that the club refused to allow Ms. Saunders to play on Saturday mornings or Wednesday afternoon, two of the most-desired tee times.
In its ruling the human-rights division said that it had no jurisdiction over the private club. The case is now in the hands of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, and it could be heard as soon as this fall, she said. 
Despite the obstacles women who have taken up golf say that by playing regularly in with other women, they are learning the game and its etiquette. And this, they say, is the best way to defuse resentment from the male golfing establishment. 
"For years, men have had men's clubs that play on Saturday mornings, and women are pooh-poohed," said Sally LaMay, who founded the Businesswomen's Golf Association of Long Island. "Do you know what G-O-L-F really stands for? Gentlemen Only, Ladies Forbidden."
For many golfers, etiquette matters as much -- some would say more -- than the final score. "The most common blunder is talking too loudly," said Ms. LaMay, a vice president at the Bank of Smithtown until her retirement five years ago. Beginners are prone to other social lapses, she said, like getting in the way of fellow golfers, obstructing the green with their carts and fumbling over which club to select.
"And you can't spend too much time looking for the ball," she added. "You get five minutes, and that's a long time. Then use a new one."
Although women may plan to play in mixed foursomes eventually, they say they feel more comfortable learning the ins and outs of the game in the company of other women. Tracy Dellomo, an assistant vice president at Merrill Lynch in Melville and a member of the Long Island Executive Women's Golf Association, cited the endurance of old stereotypes.
"If four women go onto a course," he said, "they immediately get a look from the men, like 'Oh, they're going to slow us down.' It can be intimidating. Often the guys don't play better than the women, but they know the rules. If you're a businesswoman, you don't want to go into a situation where you're at a disadvantage."
Still, the appeal of the game seems only to grow, particularly for businesswomen. "Golf is a great way to get to know someone," Ms. McInerney said. "You watch someone play, and you learn so much about their style. Do they line up the shot very carefully, deliberate over which club to select, or jump right into it? Do they select the most challenging shot or the easiest?"
For many years, Mary Jane Hartigan, a Manhasset consultant who helps clients improve their public speaking skills, played in golf tournaments, but today her golfing is usually business-related. Ms. Hartigan, whose business is called Speaking Professionally, said: "These days, I'm more interested in enjoying the afternoon with the people I'm playing with, and getting to know them as people. The final score isn't the only thing anymore."

HEADLINE: MEMO FROM WATERBURY; 
Another Mayor, Another Fine Mess, but Hey, There's Hope

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
BELIEVE it or not, there is a bright side to Waterbury's latest mess. And who better to recognize it than Gov. John G. Rowland, perhaps the city's greatest champion and most loyal native son.
 "It's not like we lost the guy who was running the budget," Mr. Rowland said in an interview last week. "It's not like we lost the guy who was making the critical decisions." 
 The guy who was lost, of course, is Mayor Philip A. Giordano, who was arrested July 26 on federal charges that he lured a child for sex. And the bright side is timing. While Mr. Giordano's future is uncertain on many fronts, as mayor he has not mattered much since March 9 and has mattered even less since July 18. 
March 9 was the day that Mr. Rowland signed a law passed by both houses of the State Legislature to save Waterbury from financial collapse. Most important, the law gave a state oversight board almost total control of the city's finances.
July 18 was the day that Mr. Giordano, a 38-year-old Republican, announced that he would not run for a fourth term.
"Musical chairs have been played in the city of Waterbury for some time," he said. "Unfortunately the music stopped under my administration and I couldn't find a chair to sit in."
It is unclear whether Mr. Giordano knew at that point, a week and a day before his arrest, that he was a target of a federal corruption inquiry. What is clear, officials concerned about Waterbury's future say, is that by the time the corruption investigation took an unexpected twist and resulted in Mr. Giordano's arrest on sex charges, the fate of the city was already largely out of his hands. 
"There is no loss," Governor Rowland said. "His being in jail is not a loss to the city at all." 
In the wake of Mr. Giordano's arrest, the state oversight board moved to consolidate its control of city finances by appointing Robert Dakers, a member of the board and an official with the state's Office of Management and Budget, as Waterbury's emergency financial director.
Sam S. F. Caligiuri, the president of the Board of Aldermen who has been serving as acting mayor, said that Mr. Dakers had already been serving in the role and that the unanimous decision by the board formalized the arrangement, giving Mr. Dakers added authority over fiscal policy.
Mr. Rowland said the city is already on the road to fiscal recovery. "We will weather this," he said. He also pointed to $45 million in state bonds recently approved for downtown redevelopment.
Mr. Giordano's arrest may have left residents of Waterbury more dispirited than ever. And the revelation of a wider, ongoing federal investigation into municipal graft has further tarnished the city's reputation.
But local officials said they were starting to pick up the pieces.
"Everyone is devastated by this," Mr. Caligiuri said. "But you got to get up the next morning and dust yourself off and do what you have to do."
In an interview last week in the mayor's office, Mr. Caligiuri, a 34-year-old corporate lawyer who is not running for re-election to the Board of Aldermen, said, "Waterbury has got problems, but they are all problems that can be fixed."
The weeks and months ahead will be painful, Mr. Caligiuri said, but he noted that the process had already begun. On the same day that Mr. Giordano was arrested, Waterbury residents began receiving their new tax bills, including a 30 percent increase, to help balance the city's budget.
"The first thing I envision is stabilizing the city's financial condition and paying the piper, so to speak, for years of financial mismanagement," Mr. Caligiuri said. "So the first step is to pay the price of the sins of the past, but to do so in a way that holds on to our citizenry and keeps them intact."
This will not be easy. In addition to the current property tax increase, Waterbury is facing its first revaluation in more than two decades. As a result of the city's depleted commercial tax base, the tax burden on homeowners is going to increase, with tax bills expected to double for some.
"Then," Mr. Caligiuri said, "we have to aggressively develop an economic vision for this city that is proactive and positive and is not simply reactive and based on having a Home Depot here and a mall there. It's got to be more aggressive than that."
Such a plan, Mr. Caligiuri said, could not possibly be developed in the five months left in Mr. Giordano's term. And so the burden will fall to Mr. Giordano's successor, even as the powers of the new mayor will be severely limited by the state financial oversight board.
The candidates include three Democrats: Larry DePillo, a self-employed computer consultant; Mike Jarjura, a state representative; and Ron Napoli, a longtime alderman; and one Republican: Dennis Odle, an executive with I.B.M. The Democratic primary is Sept. 11.
Mr. Jarjura, who sponsored the bill for the state's emergency financial takeover in Waterbury, said he saw a brighter future.
"The story of Waterbury is not the story people are hearing," he said. "We have an excellent skilled work force and a plentiful work force. We have very affordable housing. We have an excellent infrastructure in terms of roads and bridges.
"We have the ingredients that are necessary to do economic development on a massive scale. What we need to do is market those areas out to the business community across the United States and internationally. I think once that message gets out there we will be on the road to economic recovery."
Like the other mayoral candidates, Mr. Jarjura is also calling for efforts to prevent future corruption, including revision of the City Charter and greater accountability for elected officials. 
But even some residents who profess deep loyalty to Waterbury said they doubt the city will be able to bounce back quickly. Ellen Gambini, a 59-year-old librarian and lifelong Waterbury resident, said that she has childhood memories of Mayor T. Frank Hayes, who was sent to jail for corruption. "He used to walk around like he was King Tut," she said. 
Mrs. Gambini raised two children in Waterbury. All four of her grandparents were born here. And she has no plans to move. But she said she believed that the city was still suffering from its last corrupt mayor, Joseph J. Santopietro, who was convicted in 1992 and sentenced to nine years in prison. 
"I don't think we've really recovered yet from the Santopietro administration's wrongdoing," he said. Ten library workers were laid off in the last year because of budget cuts, she said, and many municipal offices are understaffed. "I don't think the oversight board knew how far down we were," she said. "We had taken off all the cream. We were down to skim milk." 
She said that she was worried about what the Federal investigation would reveal and that she was apprehensive about all of the current mayoral candidates. 
"Are these people they are bringing forth now any better?" she asked. "It's going to take an awful long time to dig out of all our other problems." 
Mr. Caligiuri, Mr. Rowland and Mr. Jarjura said the digging had begun.
"The future does look bright," Mr. Jarjura said. "Sometimes they say the darkest minute is before the dawn. I think we are going through one of the darkest moments in our history."

HEADLINE: Affordable Housing Fight Will Not Let Up 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
MORE than a decade ago, the General Assembly passed legislation forcing many towns and cities that lacked substantial affordable housing to approve such housing developments in their communities.
 Ever since then towns, many of them affluent, have been crying foul, insisting the mandate provides undue advantage to developers who use the law to force local zoning boards to approve high density, massive housing developments that only include a minimum of affordable units that are not really all that affordable. 
 Town officials maintain the developments put an undue strain on town services, are far too dense, worsen already existing traffic and pollution problems and add too many students to their already swelling school systems.
But proponents insist housing, particularly affordable housing, is so desperately needed in many suburban towns that even moderate-income households cannot afford to pay the rent there, let alone buy a home or condominium.
These advocates said the affordable housing mandate that forces towns to approve developments that include affordable housing, which can cover a vast range of rents as low as a few hundred dollars a month to more than $2,000 -- may be even more needed today than when originally established in 1989. 
Towns with fewer than 10 percent of their housing stock deemed affordable under complex state guidelines can be forced by the courts to approve the developments, even after the applications are denied by local zoning boards and town councils. They said the law is needed to counter opposition in suburban towns because of racism, classism, fear of diminishing property values and often just an effort by towns to reject anything they believe will lead to bigger budgets and higher taxes.
"The fundamental issue is that towns have to understand their borders are not immigration borders and the state has a right to intercede after seeing a pattern of thinly veiled racism and other motives behind their denials of affordable housing," said Jeffrey Freiser, executive director of the Connecticut Housing Coalition, a private organization.
Others say the law just helps developers.
"The only people benefiting from this law are developers who are using it to force massive projects down the throats of small towns by providing a few units of what they call affordable," said Rick Altschuler, a lawyer from Orange who opposes the law.
Now, both opponents and supporters of the law are wondering what the impact will be of a State Supreme Court ruling made last month that upheld a Superior Court judge's decision ordering the town of Orange to allow a proposed 168-unit affordable housing development that its zoning board had denied. 
The issue is not unfamiliar to the state's highest court, which seven years ago, acting for the first time under the affordable housing statute, issued a landmark decision that allowed a 10-unit affordable housing co-op to be built in West Hartford, ruling there were not valid reasons for the Town Council to have denied the application. That is how the Flagg Road apartments proposed by the nonprofit West Hartford Interfaith Coalition (a group of members from local churches and synagogues) ended up being built in 1994 despite strong community opposition and denial by the West Hartford Town Council.
Mayor Robert Bouvier of West Hartford, a member of the council at the time, said the council was not against affordable housing -- and still isn't -- but denied the application based on its density at a small location. The council last year raised some eyebrows when it also denied the development's application to add six parking spaces at the site, again citing lack of space.
"This has been an absolute miracle for me; it's made it possible for me to have a real life again," said Nancy Geissler, 52, a former human resources worker who lives on Social Security disability after losing a leg to diabetes.
Ms. Geissler, who lives on one of the development's two disability units, said that paying 30 percent of her income for rent now instead of more than two thirds as she did before "has allowed me to have more than the $50 I was left every month after rent." 
But in many of the larger affordable housing developments, tenants often pay between $1,000 and $2,000 a month and many of the units are advertised as luxury apartments, said critics of the affordable housing law.
In the past, the rents were based on an area's median income, but in 1995, the State Legislature changed the formula and it is now based on the lower of either the area median income or the state median income. But the change did not apply to units already built.
Several legislators, including State Representative T. R. Rowe, a Republican representing Trumbull, and various zoning and town officials in communities like Orange, Trumbull and Milford, have introduced legislation to repeal or at least modify the affordable housing law on numerous occasions.
Last year a special legislative commission issued a report on the issue and made some recommendations it said would make the law better, including a provision that allows even towns below the 10 percent minimum affordable housing requirement to place a three-year moratorium on the developments if they meet a complicated formula that includes increasing the affordable housing stock by 2 percent, with a good deal of those added units targeted for low-income people.
Opponents insisted the changes are only cosmetic -- an assertion refuted by commission members -- and does not go nearly far enough to address the real problems in the law, which they said unfairly gives developers the upper hand by putting the onus on local zoning boards to approve applications for developments that set aside at least 30 percent of its units as affordable. Towns with less than 10 percent of its units deemed affordable are subject to the state mandate.
"It's just a terrible law that doesn't even do what it was intended to do, and the way it is written we could add affordable housing developments every year for the next decade and not have enough units to be unshackled by the law's 10 percent minimum requirement," said Mr. Rowe, a member of the legislature's committee on housing who has unsuccessfully introduced three separate repeal bills the last few years.
Mr. Rowe said that in his town there had been about a half dozen projects built under the mandate, including a project that includes more than 300 units, and pointed out that Trumbull was the only town in the state that had added enough units to place a three-year moratorium on the projects, which is expected to go into effect shortly.
Now, towns around the state are wondering how the higher court's recent ruling could affect the debate, and ultimately, the law itself. In that case, the state's highest court last year interceded on its own to consider a pending Appellate Court appeal filed by Orange in its legal battle to stop a Wilton developer's court-ordered plan to build a 168-unit affordable housing complex on a 9.5 acre Prindle Hill Road site off exit 41 of the Connecticut Turnpike.
Though the town's zoning commission originally denied the application, a Superior Court judge ordered the town to approve it, and the Supreme Court has now upheld that decision -- though in the ruling the court provided the town with language officials said they believed will allow them to still prepare a new strategy to stop the development through the creation of a new industrial park plan, which would include the site where the housing development would be built.
Orange First Selectman Mitchell Goldblatt said: "It's not that we're against affordable housing; we're against massive housing projects of any kind in an area where we targeted the creation of an industrial park."
Mark Forlenza, vice president of development for AvalonBay Communities, which is behind the Orange development, said he has heard that answer before.
"Town officials always say things like that in defending their opposition to affordable housing, but the truth is they will go to any lengths to stop us," Mr. Forlenza said.
His company has built affordable housing projects in Trumbull and Wilton, is about to start construction in New Canaan and is proposing similar projects despite opposition in Darien, Stratford and Milford.
Timothy Hollister, a lawyer for AvalonBay who was an adviser to the legislative panel that drafted the law 12 years ago, said the law was designed to force local zoning boards to be more inclusive precisely because they were being exclusionary, and he said the law is working.
"The law was made necessary because of the exclusionary actions of local zoning boards that would rarely, if ever, approve affordable housing projects, even when it was blatantly obvious that their communities desperately needed more housing," Mr. Hollister said. "Some people may not like the law, but I strongly believe it was and continues to be necessary."
Mr. Forlenza said his company was forced to spend millions of dollars in legal fees in an effort to battle denials by towns, spending more than $1 million on the Orange case alone. He said that while the claim by critics that developers like AvalonBay are mainly interested in making profits, "it is also true there is a dire need for housing throughout the state, particularly in southwestern Connecticut where we are providing affordable housing for low- and moderate-income individuals and families."
Many city and state housing proponents agreed with that.
"We have seen virulent opposition by communities and town officials to both small, nonprofit sponsored developments that are 100 percent affordable, and also to the larger projects with 30 percent affordable units," Mr. Freiser of the Connecticut Housing Coalition said. 
But not all communities have opposed affordable housing. In Stamford, which has been among the leaders in the state in providing not only affordable housing, but overall housing in recent years, Ellen Bromley, the city's social services coordinator, has worked as a housing advocate and pointed proudly to the more than 4,000 affordable housing units and hundreds more that are being built.
"We're aware that around the state there is often opposition," Ms. Bromley said. "But we believe government needs to be active in providing housing for its citizens, it's something our city has been strongly committed to."
Ms. Bromley has served as a liaison since 1997 for the city, developers and the Stamford Housing Authority, which she said have worked together to provide more housing for the very poor and elderly, but also for moderate-income people, too.
"We have a need for affordable housing throughout Connecticut to cover a wide range of income levels because our population and its housing needs are so economically diverse," she said. "I'm proud to say that in Stamford we haven't needed the state statute to ensure affordable housing, but we are certainly aware there are places that do."

HEADLINE: In Palm Beach, the Ultraluxury Market Is Sizzling 

DATELINE: PALM BEACH, Fla. 

 BODY:
ONE million dollars doesn't go far in Palm Beach's high-end residential hyper market. In some new properties, it may just cover hardware costs, said Jeffrey W. Smith, an architect leading the current mega-mansion revival in this oceanfront resort. 
 "Some clients may spend $1 million just for decorative hardware," said Mr. Smith, noting that hand-tooled, gold-plated French hinges for a front door can cost $1,400 a pair. Multiplying such decorative touches by the number of knobs, grilles and lighting fixtures that might go into a 40-room house, he said, means that "Hardware can really change your budget." 
 In recent years, Mr. Smith has designed new homes on a scale not seen since the Jazz Age, when architects like Addison Mizner and Maurice Fatio were creating Mediterranean-influenced piles for the superrich. 
Want big? Try the Smith-designed winter estate of Terry Allen Kramer, a Broadway producer, and her late husband, Irwin, a New York investment banker. 
"Mrs. Kramer originally was thinking along the lines of 20,000 square feet," Mr. Smith said. "But once we sat down and discussed the details, down to the staff rooms and wine cellar, we came up with 43,000 square feet." While Mr. Smith declined to give the construction cost of the estate, he said that the owner recently turned down an offer of $60 million. 
Construction costs ranging from $500 to $1,000 a square foot appear not to discourage buyers as much as the limited availability of space on which to build. The town is an island just 14 miles long and one-half mile wide at its widest point, locked between the ocean and Lake Worth and the Intracoastal Waterway. There are 10,000 year-round residents, a figure that swells to 32,000 in the winter season, living in some 2,500 single-family homes and town houses, 5,486 condominiums and 1,040 co-ops. 
"What keeps Palm Beach so far ahead of the game is we have so little vacant land," said Liz Schuler, a broker with Sotheby's International Realty. "Many of the large estates built during the 1920's have already been subdivided into smaller lots with houses built on them."
Given the resort's social cachet and the success of the financial markets in the last decade, competition to add a Palm Beach address to one's portfolio has been white hot in recent years. 
The taxable real estate valuation in the resort jumped from $4.7 billion in 1997 to $6.8 billion today, a gain of about 44 percent, according to the Palm Beach County tax assessor's office. In that period, the average sales price of a Palm Beach dwelling went from $1.5 million to $2.7 million, said Joy Hearn, a senior appraiser in the office.
"People who want to live in Palm Beach won't settle for anywhere else, so prices are constantly going up," Ms. Hearn remarked. "If the correction on Wall Street has caused a downturn in some markets, we haven't seen it yet. People with significant assets tend to leave the stock market and put it into quality real estate." 
Brad Hunter, a real estate economist with the American Metro/Study Corporation, a Florida research firm, agreed. "The ultraluxury housing sector remains extraordinarily strong," he said. 
"There have been scattered reports of lost sales and deposits, but these cases tend to be sales in the $500,000- to $1-million range, where people are stretching for a second home and can live without it if things get tight. But at the $10-million-and-up category it's a whole different ball game. Nothing's going to change their lifestyles."
A growing trend among restless buyers in Palm Beach, also seen in other exclusive ocean communities where real estate is tight, like Boca Raton and Key Biscayne, is to purchase a property, bulldoze the existing house or houses and build a new one. This may mean an investment of $1 million for a buildable lot before the new foundation goes in, and more for waterfront properties. 
"So many Palm Beach homes were built a long time ago and people want modern conveniences," said Pamela Hoffpauer, president of Martha A. Gottfried real estate and president of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce. "More than new plumbing and kitchens," she continued, "they want features to complement their lifestyles."
Among those features: Electronic media rooms. Private theaters for movies or recitals. Colonnaded loggias with retractable window walls. Richly paneled and upholstered bars and club rooms. Bowling alleys.
SOME properties are in their second makeovers. Howard Kessler, chief executive of Kessler Financial Services of Boston, recently agreed to spend $30 million for a Palm Beach house, a Florida record for a single-family residence. The five-acre property once held an imposing 1920's Mizner mansion called Phipps Castle by the locals. But a new owner in 1975 replaced it with a contemporary 21,720-square-foot house (six bedrooms, nine baths). 
Mr. Kessler, according to a real-estate executive familiar with the transaction, plans a complete facelift for his new purchase but will not raze it. One reason for the $30 million price tag: the property includes 370 feet of private ocean beach. 
By comparison, Jim Clark, a founder of Silicon Graphics and Netscape, the pioneering Internet-browser company, landed a bargain when he bought a Fatio-designed 40,000-square foot mansion called Il Palmetio in 1999 for $11 million. The Italian palazzo-styled villa on the 5.4-acre ocean-to-Lake Worth property was built in 1930, at a cost of $2 million, for Joseph E. Widener, founder of Hialeah Park racetrack, and was last held by the late Janet Annenberg Hooker, a sister of Walter Annenberg, the publishing magnate and former ambassador to Britain. Mr. Clark has been busy with renovations ever since, however, and the buzz around town is that remodeling may cost him twice the purchase price. 
Palm Beach attracts wealthy and socially active individuals, and it remains an internationally recognized name compared with its tony but more muted neighbors like Jupiter Island and Manalapan. At last count, in the Forbes magazine annual list of the world's richest people, Palm Beach had 16 billionaires and, according to local lore, possibly more millionaires than palm trees. 
Lists of Palm Beach house sales are peppered with existing properties going for $10 to $20 million, well above what they changed hands for just a few years before.
For those who want to start from scratch, the classic style now in vogue is French Regency formality with marble floors and gilt mirrors. Mr. Smith, the architect, prefers working in the Italian 
Renaissance/Spanish Moorish style with mellow exterior stones and hip roofs of red clay tiles, the historic Palm Beach theme he incorporated into a design for Joya del Mar, the winter home of Rose and Norman Peslar.
At the south end of town are expensive condominium clusters whose owners can avoid the declasse description "high rise" because the buildings are limited to an eight-story height. Most units sell in the mid-six figures. 
In 1980, when resort hotel business sagged as individuals sought ownership in winter residences, the venerable Biltmore Hotel on the island's north side converted to condominiums. A penthouse that sold 21 years ago for $620,000 recently changed hands for $3.9 million. 
Now an existing building, Dorset House in Palm Beach, has been gutted, renamed Il Lugano and remodeled from 65 apartments to 19 ultraluxury units, ranging up to 6,000 square feet, carrying price tags of $1,000 per square foot. Marina "dockominium" slips on the property could be purchased for prices up to $325,000. 
"They sold out immediately," said Ms. Hoffpauer of Martha Gottfried realty. "The whole condo market is going like wildfire." 
No one in Palm Beach has yet tried the ultimate act of recycling attempted earlier this year by two partners in nearby Manalapan. They bought a 1928 vintage Mizner mansion, La Encantada, for $7,391,237, cut it into three pieces and planned to barge it up the inland waterway to a riverfront lot in Stuart, Fla. The barge hit all kinds of manmade and natural obstacles before the months-long odyssey was scuttled and the mansion demolished. 
In today's exclusive Palm Beach market, that's about the only way to get people talking about mobile homes.

HEADLINE: A Gadfly Focuses His Attention on Asbury Park 

BYLINE:  By KIRSTY SUCATO 

DATELINE: LONG BRANCH 

 BODY:
IN 1977, Mike Booth's fledgling weekly newspaper, The Atlanticville -- in sore need of advertisers -- was failing.
 Mr. Booth's business partners, Judi Beach and Lynne James, seemed more interested in publishing poetry and horoscopes than the tabloid-style hometown news that fired his blood. He decided to part ways, and sold his share to his partners for a dollar. 
 After leaving the newspaper's makeshift offices in Ms. Beach's apartment on Atlantic Avenue here, Mr. Booth crossed the street to Jimmy's Luncheonette to spend his dollar on a cup of tea. 
He was tormented by the fact that he had lost about $10,000 in time and money on the venture. On a whim, he spent the dollar on a lottery ticket and won $10,000. 
"Same dollar, same 15 minutes," Mr. Booth said recently, still incredulous. 
A year later, he bought back The Atlanticville for $1,000 and set about transforming it from a whimsical pet project to a cornerstone of the Long Branch establishment: a colorful and crusading tabloid with a crucial role in furthering the city's redevelopment efforts. Although Mr. Booth's friends readily describe the 53-year-old publisher as a "wack job," he has become a respected pillar and something of a local legend. 
Last summer, Mr. Booth came upon another windfall when a newspaper chain, Greater Media Inc., offered more than $1 million for The Atlanticville, with 8,000 paid subscribers in the coastal towns of Long Branch, Monmouth Beach, Oceanport, West Long Branch and Sea Bright. His wife and two other partners -- who together controlled 72.5 percent of the company -- decided to accept. 
"I've had a hundred people come up to me," said Mr. Booth, tan from all the golf he has been playing in his spare time. "Fifty expressed condolences and 50 have congratulated me. I think that pretty much sums up how I feel." 
The deal gave Mr. Booth the equivalent of a five-year salary so he would not compete with the new owners, as well as a two-thirds share in The Coaster, a 4,000-circulation weekly newspaper in Asbury Park. 
Now people are hoping that Mr. Booth can do for that struggling city what he has done for his hometown: boost redevelopment efforts through dogged coverage of local news. 
"A lot of that so-called outreach would not have been possible without his support, painstakingly writing article after article," said Pratap Talwar, a principal for the Thompson Design Group, which designed the city's master plan. "That's how it became so much in people eyes. It was a table at which everybody was welcome. Mike is an amazing guy. I have to say Asbury Park is lucky to have him."
But Mr. Booth seems a little weary.
"I don't know if I'll have the enthusiasm I had," he said. "It's not my town."
But admirers are sure he will successfully make the transition. 
"For those who don't know Mike Booth in Asbury Park, I can assure them that he is a great asset," said Dan Jacobson, the publisher of The Tri-City News, an alternative weekly newspaper in the struggling city. "He shakes things up."

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES; 
At Least One Kind of Shock Is Good for Some Stocks

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT

 BODY:
I PREDICT that within a few years, Morningstar, the mutual fund rating service, will face a typesetting challenge. I base my forecast on a new study that, if it becomes as widely accepted as I believe it will be, may persuade Morningstar to add a third dimension to its famous "style box," transforming it into a "style cube."
 Morningstar's style box, which looks like an enclosed tick-tack-toe grid, is used to classify equity mutual funds along two axes -- market capitalization (small, medium or large) and valuation (value, blend and growth) It is based on research assessing the performance of stocks according to where they fall along these two dimensions, which are referred to as styles. 
 The new study, however, by Lubos Pastor of the University of Chicago and Robert Stambaugh of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has discovered the basis for a new investing style that may be just as important as the current two. Note carefully, however, that you should not criticize Morningstar for not yet incorporating the discovery. Only in mid-July did this study even begin circulating among academics (http://finance.wharton.upenn
.edu/stambaug/liquidity.pdf).
The study focused on the stock market's overall liquidity. That focus might seem odd, because liquidity is usually defined at the level of individual stocks, generally referring to the ability to trade large quantities of that stock quickly, at low cost, without moving its price. But Professor Pastor and Professor Stambaugh were able to demonstrate that certain stocks were much more sensitive than others to changes in the market's overall liquidity.
The phenomenon is well illustrated by what happens during so-called liquidity shocks -- events like the 1987 market crash or the 1998 tumble of Long Term Capital Management. Liquidity shrinks sharply during these events, and not just for individual companies but for the market as a whole. In the wake of liquidity shocks, some stocks plummet while others barely budge.
It turns out that, over the long term, the stocks that are most vulnerable to liquidity shocks outperform those that are least vulnerable to them. From the beginning of 1966 to the end of 1999, the professors found, the most vulnerable stocks outperformed the most immune ones by an annual average of 7.5 percent. Moreover, this performance difference could not be shown in Morningstar's existing style box; it held up regardless of whether a stock was small or large cap, growth or value.
Economics 101 helps us to understand this liquidity-related style: To induce investors to own stocks that plummet during liquidity shocks, they must be rewarded with higher long-term returns. Otherwise, they would prefer stocks that are less vulnerable.
Though the two professors found that no single historical characteristic was a perfect predictor of how a stock would react to liquidity shocks, one of the useful indicators was how it reacts to large "buy" or "sell" orders. They found that if a stock tended to reverse direction the day after such orders, then more often than not it was sensitive to liquidity shocks. In contrast, a stock was relatively immune to liquidity shocks if it was less subject to such daily reversals.
But be careful not to confuse a stock's vulnerability to liquidity shocks with its volatility -- a measure of the fluctuation in its price. Such vulnerability is but one of many causes of volatility. In fact, many stocks are relatively immune to liquidity shocks but nonetheless quite volatile.
We can hope that over the next several years, Wall Street's research departments will start reporting stocks' sensitivity to liquidity shocks. If such data is made widely available, individual investors will be able to increase their long-term returns simply by filling their portfolios with the stocks that are most sensitive. But even if liquidity data is not so widely disseminated, the study shows clearly that Wall Street professionals need to add this variable to their analytical models. 
As usual, however, there is no free lunch. Without a willingness to hold such stocks through liquidity shocks, during which there will be huge short-term casualties, investors will not be able to realize the stocks' long-term potential.

HEADLINE: 2 Communities Become One to Promote Arts 

BYLINE:  By MARC FERRIS 

 BODY:
THE communities of South Orange and Maplewood have long been associated. They were one political unit until 1928, for instance, when Maplewood broke off, although the school system remains shared. Now, they trumpet the slogan "two towns, one community" and local artists have fashioned a hip sobriquet, SoMa, which evokes the central role that the arts play in both places.
 Artists have long settled in the area. The painter Asher B. Durand lived in Maplewood from 1869 until his death in 1886 and the sculptor Tony Smith, born in 1912, grew up in South Orange. Recently, residents have noticed an increase in the number of creative types who call the two towns home. 
 That recognition has led to an artistic renaissance: Sculpture is sprouting in public spaces of South Orange, and a Maplewood artist has donated a building to the town for use as an art space. By fall, ground will be broken for South Orange's $10 million Performing Arts Center, the focal point of a downtown revitalization program. 
Most observers point to New Jersey Transit's establishment of a one-seat ride to Midtown Manhattan along the Morrison-Essex Line in June 1996 as a major catalyst for the latest artistic flowering. Ending the need to transfer to the PATH train at Hoboken shaved at least 20 minutes from the trip, which now takes just under a half hour.
Before, said John Lee, a jazz bass player who has lived in South Orange since 1988, "if you didn't time it correctly, you'd be left standing there, and on weekends the services didn't mesh well."
"Now, you open your newspaper and you're in Manhattan," he said.
As word of mouth about the towns and about the improved train service spread, more and more dancers, musicians and Broadway performers began moving in. "In the late afternoons, you see people with trumpet and violin cases along the platform on the Manhattan-bound side while commuters toting attache cases arrive home," said James Buchanan, assistant director of recreation and cultural affairs in Maplewood.
The establishment of an artists network about two years ago also generated creative ferment. It began when Frank Gordon, a jazz trumpeter who has since moved to South Carolina, expressed a desire to collaborate with a choreographer. Word of his quest spread, and Ellen Greenfield, a Maplewood resident, decided to arrange for an array of local artists to meet and get acquainted. Although a light turnout was expected, almost 100 people attended the first gathering and the SoMa ArtNet was born.
"All of a sudden, we turned around and said, 'Whoa, we have an unusual number of artists out here,' " Ms. Greenfield said. "People realized that there are others doing the same thing. Visual artists, especially, are isolated so it's nice to have some kind of connection."
Joanne Miller Rafferty, a Maplewood-based painter, began to socialize with several peers who still meet regularly to critique one another's work and attend openings and exhibitions in Manhattan. "I had never run into these people before I got the flier," she said. "Now we all feel like we're coming out of our boxes. It's wonderful."
On the surface, South Orange and Maplewood are placid, affluent suburbs where broad lawns surround colonial and Victorian homes. Behind closed doors, though, artists have converted attics, basements, spare rooms, and garages into studios.
For Mr. Lee, moving to Maplewood fostered his creativity rather than stifled it. "I lived in Midtown Manhattan for 14 years, and people would sometimes bang on the walls when I practiced," he said. "Now I have a studio in my house and can play music whenever I want to without interruption." Since he travels the world performing with various ensembles, including the Dizzy Gillespie All-Stars, proximity to Newark Airport is another fringe benefit: "All those years struggling to get to J.F.K. and La Guardia are over; now, Newark is 15 hassle-free minutes away."
The towns also derive much of their vitality from their diversity. In each town, 2000 Census figures indicate that Latinos, African-Americans and Asians constitute about 40 percent of the population. They also have large gay populations.
Whenever townsfolk gather, an artistic endeavor often takes center stage.
In May, South Orange held an event called ArtWorks. Poets and musicians circulated throughout the downtown area and a local park, volunteers adorned a New Jersey Transit tunnel with a mural, and high school students painted landscapes on store windows. Maplewood celebrated the Fourth of July by holding a red, white and blue paint-in dubbed "Christo's Wall Meets Jackson Pollack."
Artists have revitalized gritty areas. "Artists are not afraid to go in and upgrade a rundown area," said Judy Wukitsch, assistant director of recreation and cultural affairs in South Orange. "Look at TriBeCa, SoHo or Hoboken. The artists moved in, the places improved, then the artists couldn't afford to stay and moved out. But we hope that doesn't happen here."
To hasten the process, both town governments are seeking sites to house artists' studios. Maplewood has got a head start, thanks to the sculptor June Cater. She has donated a one-story studio building at 1978 Springfield Avenue to the town.
Known as the "head shop," because of a series of busts that sit in the window, the building's exact future is hazy, though Ms. Cater expressly stipulated that the building be used to foster some sort of artistic pursuit. "I'm not dictating," she said. "It is intended for the use of art and artists. A committee is trying to figure out how to work it."
Efforts to secure studio space in South Orange have centered on two buildings, one owned by New Jersey Transit on South Orange Avenue, the other on Irvington Avenue, an area ripe for redevelopment.
The precedent for the South Orange government's involvement in the arts dates to 1994, when it encouraged volunteers to convert an empty room in the local community center into a professional-caliber art gallery. "No municipality operated as fast in approving the gallery as did ours," said Ms. Wukitsch, who oversees the gallery's operations.
The centerpiece of the downtown renewal plan is the performing arts center. The village purchased the land and will finance a portion of the $10 million building costs, but has formed a nonprofit corporation to coordinate the programming and oversee day-to-day operations.
The building will house a 300-seat theater, a banquet hall that can be converted into a 150-seat performance space, and a five-screen movie theater. "Almost every theater loses money," said William Calabrese, the village president. "I'm a businessman and I was looking at how to save costs and money so there would be less of a strain on the performing arts side to pay the bills."
Though the center's completion is at least a year away, there's enough going on in SoMa to draw and keep creative people. "We came here not for the artistic side of Maplewood but for the family side," said Ms. Rafferty, the painter, as she stood in her tidy basement studio. "Now that my children are in their 20's and on their own, I can find myself again. Since there's more and more artistic things happening around town, there's really no reason to leave."

HEADLINE: IN BRIEF; 
Island's Cost of Living Is Highest, Report Says

BYLINE:  By Stewart Ain 

 BODY:
A couple with two children on Long Island need an income of at least $52,114 a year to maintain a decent standard of living -- the highest of any area in the nation, according to a study by the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute.
 The primary reason is the high cost of housing, according to Chauna Brocht, a co-author of the study, which was released last week. 
She said the study used figures from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, which in 1999 put the cost of a two-bedroom apartment on Long Island at $1,100 a month. 
 The study also said a family of four would need $510 a month for food (not including eating out); $975 a month for licensed child care for children 4 and 8 years old; $240 a month for transportation (assuming the couple share one car); $741 a month for taxes; $273 for health care insurance; and $500 for other necessities. The only entertainment included was cable television. Vacation costs were not included.
Ms. Brocht said that although the federal government puts the poverty line at $17,000 a year for a family of four, that does not take into account the cost of living in different areas of the country.
Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, said the figures were "not surprising but a little misleading" because communities like Greenwich, Conn., and some suburbs of Chicago are more expensive but were not included.
But she acknowledged that "there is very little rental housing and no affordable housing" on the Island. "Young families find it difficult to live on Long Island," she said, "and they have the best education and skills we need." Stewart Ain

Airlines Are Clearing a Nonstop Path to the Plane

BYLINE:  By AILEEN CHO 

 BODY:
AT Baltimore-Washington International Airport, about 30 aviation industry designers and contractors gathered recently to exchange ideas on how to manage expansion plans at their home airports.
 Discussions of terminal design, rail connections and the best flooring for automated walkways took up much of the time. Then a vendor from a company called the Eye Ticket Corporation rose to explain a new product that caught everyone's attention: an optical security device that identifies passengers by scanning their eyeballs. 
 For William Fife, aviation director at DMJM & Harris, an engineering and design company, it was a defining moment.
"If you thought about half of these things five years ago, they would have committed you," said Mr. Fife, who has been in the airport construction management business for 30 years. "Technology is happening so rapidly, you can't keep up with it." 
From optical scanning ID to boarding passes printed at home, airports and airlines are working on ways to minimize the bottlenecks for passengers before they board the airplane.
Buying a ticket over the Internet, a novelty just a few years ago, is now routine for many travelers. Some airlines are moving toward complete automation of ticketing and baggage check-in -- eliminating the ticket counters that have been a basic part of airport architecture since commercial aviation began. Others are paging passengers automatically through wireless technology -- even before they arrive at the airport -- to alert them of flight delays or cancellations.
"All the airlines are working on a bunch of initiatives intended to reduce the number of times you have to interface with an agent," said Ginger Evans, vice president of Carter & Burgess, a design engineering firm in Fort Worth. "They call it 'giving time back to the passenger.' "
THE technological advances coincide with major expansions at many airports -- more terminal lounges, people movers, parking lots and access roads -- to handle the crowding on the ground that has come with the crowding in the skies.
Even in a weakening economy, the air traffic has been rising. More than 715 million paying passengers are expected to board planes in the United States this year, a 3.1 percent increase over last year, Federal Aviation Administration data shows. Airports Council International, a trade group in Geneva, said that of the 10 cities worldwide with the most air passengers last year, seven are in the United States: New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Houston, Las Vegas and Washington.
"You have technology for service, technology for operations and technology for expansion," said Gerald FitzGerald, president of PB Aviation Inc., a subsidiary of Parsons Brinckerhoff, an engineering firm based in New York. "All of these are undergoing a lot of changes."
Alaska Airlines has 374 self-serve kiosks where passengers can buy tickets and check in for their flights at the airport. The airline says the machines are now used by one-third of its passengers. Both Alaska and Northwest Airlines also allow passengers to print boarding passes at home, from their personal computers.
"Before even arriving at the airport, you are able to go to our Web site, bring up your reservation and check-in, print out your boarding pass," said Jack Walsh, spokesman for Alaska Airlines. "If you have no bags to check, you can head straight to the gate, show your ID and head down the jetway. On the other hand, if you have bags to check, we're doing things to facilitate that."
In Anchorage and Portland, Ore., Alaska is testing a self-service kiosk that prints a passenger's luggage destination tags. The passenger attaches the tag to the bag, drops it on a conveyor belt and heads to the plane.
At San Jose International Airport in California, American Airlines is testing a telephone check-in service, self-serve ticketing and even roving agents, who use hand-held computers to issue boarding passes. At La Guardia Airport in New York, US Airways allows passengers to use Palm Pilots to check in.
"The theory is that in 10 years we'll be wondering what to do with all that ticket lobby space," said Kim Day, deputy executive director at Los Angeles World Airports, the agency that runs Los Angeles International Airport. In fact, when Alaska Airlines rebuilds its terminal at Anchorage, it plans to remove the traditional row of ticket counters at the entrance. Instead, there will be islands of kiosks. 
Dan Wong, senior transportation planner at San Francisco International Airport, said the diminished importance of ticket counters would change the look of an airport departure terminal.
"You'll see a huge difference," he said. "There'll be better information displays, retail shops with the ability to transmit information to passengers."
Some airlines are concentrating on new ways to accommodate passengers whose flights have been delayed or canceled. United Airlines, for example, said it was pushing forward with a system that informs passengers by pager of the next available flight, even if it is on another carrier. 
Privacy and security, of course, are potential problems in systems that assume that passengers will use credit cards at kiosks or have personal information stored on a database. 
"For something to be successful, you have to have customer acceptance," Mr. Walsh said. 
But airline officials say that if the success of Internet ticketing is any indication, they are optimistic. And there is anecdotal evidence that the newest technology is a hit, at least among frequent fliers.
David Cohen, who with his brother owns a computer design business in New York, said he had started to use the self-serve kiosks regularly. "They speed up the time of check-in immensely," he said. But he added, "my only concern is that no one checked my ID; I know I am O.K., but that is a bit scary with other people."
Mr. Cohen said he would welcome other technology. He would gladly print out his boarding passes at home, he said, or use eyeball-scanning identification at the airport.
EyeTicket is a leader in optical scanning security technology, which identifies a person by recognizing his or her iris, the ring around the pupil of the eye. Stewart Mann, chief executive of the company, based in McLean, Va., said the technology had not been developed with a specific airport use in mind. But when the prototype was ready in 2000, the International Air Transport Association was the first industry group to be given a presentation.
"Sometimes this industry is slow to change, but the fact of the matter is, it is looking for better solutions and products," Mr. Mann said.
Last month, EyeTicket and the association announced an experiment at Heathrow Airport, near London, in cooperation with British Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways, to provide what it called "one stop" passenger processing to 2,000 frequent fliers registered on a database. Passing near a camera, the travelers will have their identities confirmed instantly from their iris patterns, allowing them speedy entry that bypasses customs and immigration bottlenecks.
Anticipating more such tests, Mr. Mann said officials at other airports "have been opposite of skeptical -- they've been as receptive as we could hope for."
"Two years in this industry is light speed," he said, referring to the time it took for tests of his product to begin.
SOME airport logistics, of course, are less open to advancements. The designers of the moving sidewalk at Denver International Airport, constructed in the 1980's, made it one-third wider than most conventional conveyors, said Ms. Evans, who oversaw the construction. That increased the comfort level of passengers, she added, so that they would accept "slightly higher walkway speeds." But, she said, people movers "are not changing much in technology."
Mr. Fife, too, said that even with all the advancements, an airport's ability to minimize crowding can go only so far. "We're not at the level of 'beam me aboard, Scotty,' " he said.

After a Death, the Song Remains the Same

BYLINE:  By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
IT has been almost a year since Anthony Amato buried his wife, Sally, in a cemetery near their home on City Island in the Bronx. Mr. Amato, 81, visits daily, sometimes talking to the memory of the woman with whom he founded the tiny opera company that bears his name. The company, which began in 1948, is fabled as much as for making opera accessible to the masses as for surviving for decades on passion and a shoestring.
 Of all the changes at the company, which begins its 54th season in September with "Aida," the greatest is the absence of the vivacious Mrs. Amato, who used to greet people at the door, run the box office, operate the lighting board and make costumes. In the Amato Theater Company's white brick building at 319 Bowery, near Second Steeet, she was the mom to Mr. Amato's pop; a pop who selects the operas, auditions singers, directs and conducts. 
 "She did everything," Mr. Amato said. "That's how we survived." He is a short, white-haired man with a gallant manner who is the company's executive director. A tenor, he met his wife, a singer and actress, in 1943 when they were both performing at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J. They married two years later and spent their lives building their populist vision of repertory opera.
These days, regular adult tickets at the 107-seat house cost $28. Tickets at the Metropolitan Opera can cost as much as $190.
"The theater has been my savior," Mr. Amato said. "I'm here in the morning and I go home 10 or 15 hours later. I feel Sally is with me always."
Although Mrs. Amato died nearly a year ago, at 82, in the year since the Amato's mailing list grew by 2,500 to 9,700, and for the first time the company hired a certified public accountant to handle the record $180,000 budget. Only in the last two years have staff workers or performers been paid.
There were times when Mr. Amato feared they could keep going only by operating as a supper club. It took a quarter of a century for the economy and the neighborhood to catch up with their vision of a place where beginners could perfect their craft before an audience of devotees with slim wallets. The neighborhood now is downright hip, with new restaurants and clubs, and a poetry center is set to open across the street.
"The Amato is a historic and cultural gem," said Jack Needle, a history teacher at Brookdale Community College in Lyncroft, N.J., who has been sending busloads of fans to the Amato for 20 years. "I've been told by opera students that it's similar to the houses for opera students throughout Europe. Tony and Sally provided that opportunity when those opportunities were strictly limited."
It was not surprising to Mr. Amato that several months ago representatives from Coral Realty, a company in Little Italy, offered to buy the opera house to use the land for a New York University dormitory. After some soul-searching, Mr. Amato decided to stay small and keep the building in the family. Coral Realty then bought the property now occupied by the Chelsea Garden Center at 321 Bowery, next door to the Amato.
Still being negotiated is whether the 128-foot-tall dormitory, going up in September, will allow the Amato's performers space to get on and off the stage, which is just 18 feet wide. For three years, performers have scurried into the garden next door without being seen by the audience. Some of Mr. Amato's neighbors have also expressed concern about the height of the new building, which will be the tallest on the block, and about the noise associated with student housing. 
"We're going to help Tony maintain his exit," said Tom Whalen, the project manager for Coral Realty. "We are exploring three or four options with the architect that allows them to use our building." 
The company has been housed in the 22-foot-wide building since 1963, after giving its first performances in the basement of a Greenwich Village church. But the Amato, of course, is more than just a building. 
"People would have thought 20 years ago that the time had passed for them," said Steve Zeitlin, executive director of City Lore, a folklore center that documents the city's cultural heritage.
In 1998, the center installed the Amatos into its People's Hall of Fame. "After Tony dies, they will need someone as passionate as Tony to keep it going," Mr. Zeitlin said. "That will determine if it works, no matter how New York changes."

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY; 
In Genoa's Noise, a Trumpet for Capitalism

BYLINE:  By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE latest protest-riddled meeting of the world's industrialized powers is over, but not before inspiring more unease about the whole idea of these high-level schmoozefests. A single demonstrator in Genoa, Italy, was killed -- in the act of hurling a fire extinguisher at a police van -- and many influential people suddenly began to fret very loudly in public. 
 Any death is sad, but it is important not to let this one obscure what these protests signify. I do not mean anarchy, although they may seem to imply that. Nor do they mean the beginning of the end of growing world trade and spreading international development. Hardly. 
 No, the protests are mainly advertisements for the strength of the capitalist democracies that provoke them. These ardent young people, who plan their trips to these conferences on the Internet, carry cell phones and arrive by jet, often without having to stop at customs because of relaxed rules in the new Europe. They are symbols for the wonders of the very system they're so worked up about. 
The Group of 8 nations are so successful, in fact, that they can spare their young citizens the travails of pointless war, periodic famines or subsistence farming. Instead, capitalism offers them the balm of extended studies lasting well into adulthood, punctuated only by public tantrums over the failure of their imagined utopia to materialize. It's a system so adept at producing freedom, leisure and long life that it gives us ample opportunity to indulge the harmless luxury of "a nihilist avant-garde," as John Updike's fictional novelist Henry Bech called it in noting its absence from what was then Communist Czechoslovakia.
Of course, this luxury is only harmless while the grown-ups act grown up. These protesters, however, have no coherent idea what they're after. In general, there is talk of a better shake for the world's poor, yet the demonstrators appear to be against the only thing giving the world's poorest nations any hope at all: continued global economic growth, led by import-happy Americans whose purchases help put food on the table from Bolivia to Bangladesh.
That is why, young and handsome and idealistic as these protesters so often are, it is important to crush them -- figuratively, of course -- if they won't go home and find other means of exorcising their great guilt at their own good fortune. You may not like the collection of aging white men who, thanks in part to the power of corporations, lead the world's richest nations. But for all their flaws, the economic vision they represent is infinitely more plausible and more humane than the one their critics appear unable even to articulate.
And while these demonstrators mainly demonstrate how wildly successful capitalism has been in the various G-8 countries, their ideas are a threat to the very people they seem bent on helping. The worry is that a few of the G-8 leaders, experienced at caving in to protesting train workers and the like, will lose a little of their fervor not only for international conferences, but also for internationalism generally. 
Soon after the Genoa meetings ended last month, for instance, President Jacques Chirac of France said it was time to give serious thought to what was prompting so many people to turn up in the streets. "There is an anxiety, a concern there," Mr. Chirac said. "We cannot pretend that it doesn't exist." 
Le Monde went further. "Public opinion will no longer support these reunions, the violence they trigger and the decisions they produce," it wrote. "It is time to review the formula."
But how can it be bad that some of the world's leaders meet? And what about the hundreds of millions of people around the world who benefit from the decisions that come from these sessions? For the world's downtrodden, the rise of global trade and investment is the best hope not just for a better life but also for greater human rights, political power and a more peaceful world. The other things that have been tried so far, like collectivized agriculture and huge foreign loans, are part of a litany of failures with side effects too vast to enumerate here. 
All we need now are Western leaders with the guts to act on what they already know.

HEADLINE: Business; 
Yamaha Is Mining Its Musical Strength

BYLINE:  By MIKI TANIKAWA 

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
AS Japan lapses into its fourth recession in 10 years, many big Japanese multinational corporations are confronting an even more dismal outlook than before. Not the Yamaha Corporation, the world's largest maker of musical instruments.
 In a turnaround story unusual for an old established Japanese brand that had fallen on hard times, Yamaha has gone from years of stagnation to a strong profit. Its stock price is up 44 percent from an October low, while the broader market is down nearly 20 percent over the same period. 
 Defying skeptics who wondered how a company that had historically depended on sales of acoustic pianos into a relatively limited market could survive, Yamaha has exploited its strength in music. It has successfully marketed an electronic instrument technology it pioneered in the mid-1990's that enables musicians -- indeed, entire orchestras -- to practice silently, hearing only themselves and not disturbing others.
Yamaha, which owns one third of the Yamaha Motor Company, the motorcycle maker, has also grown to dominate other kinds of music technology. It is a leading maker of amplifiers used in home theater equipment and computerized programmable player pianos that are popular in the United States, the company's biggest foreign market, which accounts for nearly 20 percent of Yamaha's overall sales.
And in the last few years, Yamaha has developed a new business in Japan -- making the programmable ringing-sound chips in millions of wireless phones, as well as selling the ringing tones for the phones over the Internet. The tones are highly popular in Japan, where many people download them weekly or even daily as a way to differentiate and personalize their wireless phones.
"This year was a turnaround year," said Shuji Ito, a career Yamaha executive promoted from senior managing director to president and chief executive in April 2000. Mr. Ito's predecessor, Kazukiyo Ishimura, resigned after the company lost a record 40.7 billion yen, or about $380 million, on sales of 527.9 billion yen for the fiscal year ended in March 2000. In the fiscal year ended this last March, the company earned 13.3 billion yen, or about $120 million, on sales of 519.1 billion yen. 
YAMAHA'S music technology is not the only reason for its improvement. The company has done what many big Japanese corporations are loath to do: dismiss workers. Last year, Yamaha cut 1,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its total. The company also quit making computer disk drive components, a business in which it had invested heavily and but had never made money.
Yamaha's comeback is significant for another reason. While navigating the economic slump in Japan, Yamaha has been dealing with broader challenges: a dwindling young population in Japan and the collapse in the popularity of studying piano in Japan, where the company derives more than half its sales.
After enjoying strong growth in the 1960's and 1970's, capitalizing on mass production techniques that helped lower costs and enabled a middle-class Japanese family to own an acoustic piano, the company suffered a long decline in acoustic piano sales, which at the time were the largest source of Yamaha's business. 
The proliferation of electronic organs and keyboards during the 1980's and the collapse of Japan's bubble economy in the early 1990's were considered partly responsible. But more important, fewer Japanese children were playing Yamaha pianos.
Previously, piano study was widespread in Japan because of a belief among parents that it helped "cultivate young children's aesthetic sensitivity," said Saburo Seki, a Yamaha spokesman.
At its peak, Yamaha sold 238,000 acoustic pianos annually. Last year, it sold 108,000.
Yamaha sought to compensate for the decline by inventing new versions of its classic instruments that it hoped would invigorate sales. 
The most significant innovation was its Silent Series acoustic piano. The piano is equipped with a switch that stops the hammers from striking the strings. Electronic sensors reproduce the sounds the hammers would have made, transmitting them to the musician's headset. 
The idea, developed by Yamaha engineers in 1993, was received enthusiastically in Japan and Europe, where scarcity of space and privacy often made practicing musical instruments difficult at home. Sales of the pianos surged.
Yamaha has since broadened the technology to the violin, cello, trumpet and tuba. It has even extended it to drums -- from which outsiders hear only a quiet tapping.
With an array of neighbor-friendly instruments, small orchestras can hold a silent rehearsal or concerts -- players listen to one another's sounds with headsets, while people around them hear nothing.
WHILE the technology has strengthened Yamaha sales, not all musicians are happy with it. Many serious players of brass instruments, for example, are critical because they think the artificial sound is deceptively good through the headset, providing a false sense of quality. 
Yuka Matsushita, 28, a trumpeter who plays in an amateur brass band in Hyogo prefecture in western Japan, near Osaka, said one negative of the silent feature is that it "beautifies your performance." 
The company's musical successes have occasionally been overshadowed by some big nonmusical mistakes. Its biggest, electronics industry analysts say, was in 1991, when it started a business manufacturing computer disk drive components, which require huge amounts of investment capital and research. It soon became clear that Yamaha could not compete with other manufacturers.
Part of the reason Yamaha floundered was its motive -- trying to find something to do for its excess engineers, whom the company was reluctant to lay off, said Katsuhiko Sugiyama, an executive fellow at the Ichiyoshi Institute of Research in Tokyo and a veteran analyst of the electronics industry. 
Some products closer to Yamaha's musical roots began to blossom only recently. The popularity in ringing tones for wireless phones, and the demand for better sound, created enormous demand for the tiny sound chips that Yamaha excels in manufacturing.
The phone-sound business, which Yamaha started last year, was responsible for 7.5 billion yen, or 1.5 percent, of the company's 519.1 billion yen in revenue for the fiscal year ended in March, but it is one of the fastest-growing Yamaha operations. 
Analysts said Yamaha's new challenge was to build on its musical instrument technology and cultivate new customers.
Mr. Ito says Yamaha has two markets in mind: the very young and the very old. 
To attract the young, Yamaha has created a Web site called Music Front, where aspiring musicians apply to have their music evaluated for commercial potential. Yamaha will give musicians who pass the screening an online debut and help them win contracts with recording companies. Yamaha plans to make money on the site by retaining the original rights to the musicians' work, ensuring that it receives a share of the profits should the musician turn successful later.
And to capitalize on the growing number of elderly Japanese who are looking for ways to enjoy life in retirement, Yamaha is opening schools around the country that teach senior citizens how to play musical instruments.
"The days are gone when people bought instruments without us having to tell them to," Mr. Ito said.

HEADLINE: TALKING MONEY WITH/KEN FOLLETT; 
No Plot Twists In a Novelist's Portfolio

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
IN many of Ken Follett's blockbuster thrillers, men with seedy pasts are prepared to kill, often to serve their governments. Beautiful women, seduced by these men, escape from their sexual hold only when they face almost certain -- and painful -- death. Danger lurks everywhere.
 The tales are played out on a global stage -- a storm-whipped, nearly deserted Scottish island, or maybe in Afghanistan or Iran. 
 It is not just Mr. Follett's stories that are unfettered by national boundaries. Mr. Follett, who has lived in Britain most of his life, is himself something of a multinational enterprise. The author of 13 best sellers -- including "Eye of the Needle," "The Man from St. Petersburg" and "The Key to Rebecca" -- that have been translated into more than a dozen languages, he figures that sales of his books last year "were probably 50 percent in dollars, 30 percent in euros and 20 percent in everything from sterling to yen." 
"My home market is very small," he said during a recent interview here on the terrace of Parliament, where his wife, Barbara, is a member of the House of Commons. "The bulk of my income comes from exports."
So Mr. Follett, 52, who sometimes acts more like a chief executive than a master storyteller, watches foreign economies and stock markets closely for their effects on his revenue streams. "If the American stock market is down, and I mean big movements in the stock market, it affects the American economy," said the dapper Mr. Follett, who was dressed, as is often the case, in a well-tailored suit. "Ultimately, that affects how much money people have to buy books."
His many loyal readers have enabled him to reach a net worth that he puts at more than $17 million. It is money he has amassed with the same care to details that he gives to the murders his villains commit in, say, their third-rate hotel rooms.
Unlike his protagonists, Mr. Follett adheres to strict limits on the risks he is willing to take -- at least financially. For the most part, he shies away from buying stocks, an endeavor he considers pure gambling. Even Warren E. Buffett, the legendary American investor, "is just lucky," Mr. Follett said.
"He doesn't know any more than anyone else," he added.
Instead, Mr. Follett has most of his money in real estate and cash or in short-term instruments like bank certificates or Eurodollars, which are dollars held by banks outside the United States; he also spends freely. He is intent on preserving, rather than vastly enlarging, what he earns, and on enjoying the fruits of his labor. Experts aren't for him. He is the one who closely monitors his fortune, using off-the-shelf personal finance software, and who does most of the investing.
Mr. Follett tends his income carefully by striking publishing deals that have brought him as much as $6 million just for the American rights to a single book -- more than all but a handful of authors receive, though not in the league of Tom Clancy or Michael Crichton, who get several times that. He likes to negotiate payments in monthly installments -- a rare demand for authors, who usually receive several payments as a book is completed and published.
"It's a comfort," he said. "It's pleasant to know how much money is coming in every month." 
Although he has had no formal financial training, Mr. Follett worked with his bankers to hedge his income from the fluctuations in value of the currencies in which he is paid. That way, when almost all of his income was in dollars, and they were declining against the pound, his income did not suffer.
But he also enjoys living luxuriously. Mr. Follett owns three homes, and just sold a fourth one, in France. His airplane of choice is the Concorde, he hobnobs with celebrities and he used to be a highly visible fund-raiser for the Labor Party.
He may be a socialist, but "I am not St. Augustine," he said, laughing. "I am not interested in wearing a hair shirt," he added.
His associates can attest to that. They say he is generous to others as well as himself. "He doesn't skimp," said Albert Zuckerman, Mr. Follett's longtime agent and the chairman of Writer's House, a group of American literary agents. "He takes suites in first-class hotels and flies first class. He doesn't sit on his money."
BUT until Mr. Follett's first best seller, "Eye of the Needle," was published when he was 29, he had no money to sit on.
He grew up, first in Cardiff, Wales, then in London, the oldest of three children in what he calls a perfectly typical family. His parents "were not desperately poor, but they had no disposable income," he recalled.
"We almost never went to restaurants," he added. "My father began as a clerk for the Inland Revenue. But he worked very hard. Before too long he passed his accountancy exam and he became an inspector," a lesson to his son in the value of hard work.
The family was also deeply religious and belonged to the Plymouth Brethren, a fundamentalist Protestant sect. His mother kept house.
When he was 18, Ken Follett married for the first time, to his girlfriend, Mary, "because we got pregnant," he said. Still, he attended University College London, majoring in philosophy, then became a reporter for The South Wales Echo, in part because of his interest in politics.
His book-writing career began for a most practical reason. His car, a Vauxhall Ventora, needed a $:200 repair, and he had seen a television show on which a guest talked of getting a $:200 advance for a first book.
Soon, Mr. Follett sealed himself in the bedroom after work and began writing "The Big Needle," a novel about drug dealers that was published by Everest Books, a small company in London that hired him shortly after the book came out.
Ten more followed, many with working-class British backdrops. "None of those books were successful," Mr. Follett said. "But my advances started to go up. I got $:500. You could take the family on holiday to Spain for two weeks for $:250 in those days, so it was real money."
But it was not real success until he followed some advice from Mr. Zuckerman, the agent he met in 1973 and who began representing him. "Al told me, the American book buyer is not interested in the details of English working-class life; people are not interested in the humdrum."
Mr. Follett paid heed, producing "Eye of the Needle." An outline for the book, a taut World War II thriller, earned a $:1,500 advance in England in 1977, about $2,600 at that time.
He then sold hardcover rights in the United States for $20,000. When the paperback rights were auctioned, based on a second draft, "the floor was $50,000 and someone had told me it would never go for more than that," he remembered.
"I was sitting in my little tract house," he added. "At about 4 o'clock, I called New York and Al told me that it had reached $500,000, of which two-thirds would have been mine because there was a share for the hardcover publisher.
"Then around 8 o'clock that night, Al called me and told me the bidding had stopped at $800,000. I calculated that if I had stayed in my job -- though I had recently quit the publishing position -- until I was 65, the amount of money I would have earned was about the same as the amount of money that phone call gave me."
THAT night, Mr. Follett did what he always did when he sold a book: he bought Champagne. The ritual began with his first book deal, because "I had a check in my hand for $:150 that I hadn't budgeted for and a bottle of Champagne cost $:5." Now, he said, he has Champagne every night.
The book sold by the cartload in the United States, and still sells 100,000 copies a year around the world, he estimated. Within a year, Mr. Follett had saved $1 million. His investment strategy was simple and typically English. He opened a bank account in Switzerland and soon moved to France, where the taxes and the elements were less oppressive than in England.
"Suddenly, you make all this money," Mr. Follett said. "My immediate thought was the south of France. I had been there. I liked it. I liked sunny weather."
The Folletts and their two children moved to Grasse. Though he had an account at a Swiss bank, generally he did not do much investing. "I talked to them about investment, but I kept nearly all my money in cash," he said. "In those days interest rates were quite good. And the Eurodollar market was quite good, so we used to keep our money in dollars."
After two or three years, however, he missed England, so he returned despite the heavy tax burden.
The return had major personal as well as financial consequences. Mr. Follett had become active in the Labor Party after college ("I never accepted my parents' theology, but the habit of belonging to some group with a mission was probably bred into me," he reflected) and reactivated his membership upon his return. At a 1982 Labor Party gathering, he met Barbara Broer. Though he initially found her bossy, and she thought he looked like a weasel, over time they fell in love and left their respective mates. They married in 1984.
During this period, he wrote some of his best-known thrillers, including "The Key to Rebecca," another World War II spy novel. He typically spends about eight months on an outline, often revising it eight or nine times, and then a year writing.
Over the years, he has had his differences with some of his publishers. One deal in particular made news: Mr. Follett and Dell Publishing fought in 1994 over the second book of a two-book, $12.3 million deal. When Dell did not like the proposed theme -- an 18th-century tale of a Scottish countryman who wound up in Kentucky -- the two sides withdrew from the deal, and Mr. Follett moved to Crown Publishers. Since then, Mr. Follett, who has continued to stray from what many people feel is his strength, has had fewer blockbusters and is said to be commanding about $4 million a book for United States rights, a figure he does not dispute. He is now with Penguin Putnam, which is publishing his next book, "Jackdaws," and has returned to writing thrillers set during World War II or the cold war, in hopes of recapturing his core audience.
A smaller part of his income -- about $2.5 million -- has come from adaptations on the big and the small screen. "Eye of the Needle" was a hit film in 1981. "On Wings of Eagles" became a mini-series, as did several other Follett books. (Ross Perot, the billionaire and founder of Electronic Data Systems, selected Mr. Follett to write "On Wings of Eagles," the story of a 1979 mission organized by Mr. Perot to rescue two E.D.S. employees from an Iranian prison.) And Douglas Wick, a producer of "Gladiator," just paid $200,000 to option film rights on "Code to Zero," published last year.
All told, it appears that his deals could be worth about $60 million.
Of course, Mr. Zuckerman has received his 10 percent fee, some of which went to Mary Follett after the divorce, and then there are those onerous British taxes.
Guided by a conservative investing bent, Mr. Follett estimates that about half of his fortune is in real estate. His three homes include a town house, built in 1732, in the Soho district of London. Then there is a nine-bedroom former rectory, complete with a tunnel from the living room to an indoor swimming pool, in Stevenage, the constituency north of London that Barbara Follett represents. A two-bedroom house on Antigua in the Caribbean has its own pool and tennis court. Most of the rest of his assets are in highly liquid investments.
Though his bankers make some equity investments -- which he declines to name -- Mr. Follett generally dismisses the market. (He does, however, have a healthy respect for people who run companies well. "That is not luck at all," he said. "It is character, brains, determination and imagination." Mr. Perot, he said, "did not get this rich because he knows computers; he got rich because he can get other people to work their socks off for him.")
In investing, it is not the risk that bothers Mr. Follett. "It is all that effort I made on the book going up in smoke," he said. "That's what I hate."
Protecting his assets, rather than scoring big, was also the reason he took to hedging. In the 1980's and early 1990's, when most of his income was in dollars, he hedged, he said, to help reduce the risk that a slump in the dollar would mean trading it for fewer pounds. Now, he said, his royalty income comes in so many currencies that they effectively hedge one another.
He says he watches his money for a simple reason: "Some people make investments on my behalf, but I would never let one person have control of everything because who takes care of your money like you do?"
If Mr. Follett's insistence on keeping tight control over his finances suggests arrogance, some publishing executives say privately that he can be imperious and that he does not take editorial direction well. Mr. Follett bristles at that notion, because "I am so focused on pleasing the reader that any good criticism is important to me." Still, he added: "I admit I know best. The decision to take the advice remains with me."
Even when he is at work on a new book, he keeps an eye on his finances, tracking them on Quicken, the computer program. "I have a bookkeeper who inputs the data and writes checks," he said. "It is for ordinary people, and anytime you switch it on, it tells you your net worth."
Mr. Follett doesn't pretend that his attempts to control his fortune will guarantee success, though he feels confident that it is the best route for him. And he dismisses reports in the British media that he has a much bigger fortune, $:25 million pounds (nearly $36 million). "My net worth is actually about $:12 million," he said. "Journalists in this country simply make stuff up."
Given that he is from Britain, where mum tends to be the word, and is a leftist member of the Labor Party, he is surprisingly willing to talk about his wealth. He attributes that directness in part to his Welsh background, and thinks that Richard Burton, another famous Welshman, was a good illustration. "He had a big appetite for life and was open about it -- no stiff-upper-lip nonsense," Mr. Follett said.
Howard Stringer, the Welsh-born chairman of the Sony Corporation of America and a friend of Mr. Follett's, is not surprised by his openness or pride in accomplishment. "Because 50 percent of the work force was in coal mining, there is not much for entrepreneurs" in Wales, Mr. Stringer said. "The Welsh are kind of thrilled when you make it. They cheer you on."
The author says that after all these years of work, "I kind of feel entitled" to the financial rewards. Besides, he said, he is having too much fun to hide it. "How could you hide it?" he asked. "People see the books on the best-seller list. They know we live well and entertain a lot."
Still, friends and associates say he is not pretentious. Mr. Stringer recalled a dinner several years ago at Mr. Follett's London town house, with about 14 people, including the former Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman. "We ate in the kitchen, and family members kept coming and going," Mr. Stringer said, "but there was a superb bottle of Bordeaux."
Among those he counts as friends is his former wife, Mary. Mr. Follett's son from his first marriage, Emanuele, recalled that his parents' divorce was difficult for him and his sister, Marie-Claire, as well as for the three children of his stepmother, Barbara. Mr. Follett conceded that the divorce was "terrible" but said the couple never fought over money. "We had been poor together and we got rich together," he said, "and I thought she was absolutely entitled to what she got."
"We never used a divorce lawyer -- we did it ourselves," he added. And after he had paid alimony for seven years, he said, "she phoned me up and said: 'Seven years is long enough. I think you should stop.' "
THE current Mrs. Follett is a graduate of the London School of Economics who has worked within her party to support women who are running for Parliament. 
She is, however, far more private about her money. Over lunch in the Churchill Room in Parliament, Mrs. Follett, who helped train political figures for public appearances before she became the Labor Party representative from Stevenage in 1997, bristled when asked about her finances. "I don't know that I really want to talk about my money if you don't mind," she said.
But both Folletts clearly have strong views about financial responsibility, and about how to impart such values to children. All five of theirs are now grown. "They are 26 to 36 years old, and most of them are in the arts," Mr. Follett said. "We have a very simple rule. We gave them an allowance when they were in full-time education. And when they stopped, we didn't give them any money. My daughter is an actress, so that when she came out of drama school, she wasn't making enough money to live on. She washed up in Ed's Diner, that kind of thing.
"There is something about rich kids that bothers me," he continued. "The experience of working -- of having to work for money -- is kind of an important growing-up experience. Knowing that somebody does not give a curse about you as an individual -- he just wants you to wash the damn dishes. If you do it, he will pay you, and if you don't, he won't. That is a growing-up experience."
But Mr. Follett is not as inflexible as he sounds. He helped Emanuele, now 33, buy a building in which he runs rehearsal studios for rock groups. And socialist desires notwithstanding, Mr. Follett intends to leave his fortune to his children when he dies. "I guess looking after your children in the end is more important than living in a just world," he said.

His wife, Barbara, far left, is a graduate of the London School of Economics and a Labor Party member of Britain's House of Commons, where her interests include economic development, foreign relations and equal rights for women.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Price Targets Are Hazardous to Investors' Wealth

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
LAST Dec. 5, Andrew J. Neff, a computer analyst at Bear, Stearns, issued a report extolling the virtues of Palm Inc., the maker of hand-held computers. After meeting with Palm's management, Mr. Neff had come away a believer in the company's future and its battered shares. With the stock near $44, Palm was well below its March 2000 peak of $165, reached on its first day of trading. He put a 12-month price target of $80 on the shares, reflecting his belief that they would trade at 19 times his 2001 sales estimate for the company.
 By the next week, Palm shares had climbed to $56.625. But then they began to sink, until, on Jan. 3, they had reached $27.88. That day, Mr. Neff cut his target to a range of $37 to $48. Two months later, with Palm in the mid-teens, Mr. Neff lowered his target again. Finally, on May 17, the shares stood at $7.05 when he slashed his target to around $5. It closed on Friday at $5.36. 
 Mr. Neff was by no means alone on Wall Street in his misplaced optimism regarding Palm. But his remarkable and almost certainly unreachable target of $80 for Palm shares does exemplify one of the most deplorable practices found among analysts during the stock market mania: the assignment of target prices that were based more on fantasy than reality. 
"Those price targets were the equivalent of snake oil being sold off the back of covered wagons in the Wild West," said Stefan D. Abrams, chief investment officer for asset allocation at the Trust Company of the West in New York. "The mere fact that you could not defend them by any rational means is evidence that these were nothing more than sales hype." 
Yet while money managers like Mr. Abrams recognized price targets for what they were -- and laughed them off -- many individuals bought stocks at least in part on their promise. Now they are sorry.
Early in the mania, of course, investors who bought stocks based on wild targets did well. Amazon.com blew through Henry Blodget's famous $400 target about a month after he assigned it in December 1998. And for every seemingly crazy target that was subsequently met, the next one became more credible. 
Because analysts kept raising their price targets as the stocks neared them, investors were emboldened to stay at the party even after the band had gone home. Rather than advising investors to sell overpriced stocks, analysts, with their escalating price targets, kept investors in the shares long after they had begun to fall.
Mr. Neff said his early optimism about Palm was based on a less rigorous methodology than he applied to the stock later. But he said that "it doesn't make intellectual sense to have an investment rating unless you have some sort of price target in mind."
Big and bold price targets are a relatively new phenomenon in Wall Street research reports. In the 1980's, an analyst might estimate a range within which a stock could trade, based on what the analyst expected the company to earn. But such targets were low profile and typically surrounded by caveats.
Robert A. Olstein, manager of the Olstein Financial Alert fund, said today's use of dubious targets was an extension of a trend among analysts toward predicting next week's earnings instead of valuing companies. "Today's analysts are soothsayers, because they're trying to predict where the crowd frenzy is going to take a stock," he said. "No one has ever been able to do that with any degree of certainty." 
Other investment veterans say that howlingly high price targets became the rage in the late 1990's because analysts, in the midst of the huge bull market, found it difficult to differentiate themselves from the herd. "It was a way for an analyst to establish himself as the most bullish person on a particular issue," said Mitch Zacks, vice president of Zacks Investment Research in Chicago. "That was very useful for the investment banking business of the firm." 
Surprisingly, while share prices of many former darlings are now in the cellar, and while Wall Street analysts, with their myriad conflicts of interest, are sweating under an increasingly unpleasant spotlight, wildly optimistic price targets can still be found on stocks. Instead of owning up to their too-rosy predictions, two of the largest brokerage firms acknowledge that in some cases, their analysts simply eliminate the price targets altogether without comment. 
According to research conducted by Zacks, price targets on the nation's largest technology stocks are currently so high that their stocks would have to rise 80 percent, on average, to meet them. 
Lucent Technologies, as of last Wednesday's close, would have to vault 204 percent to meet analysts' average target price, EMC would have to almost double and Hewlett-Packard would have rise 40 percent.
"The price target is the piece of data produced by Wall Street that is least tied to reality," Mr. Zacks said. "They tend to be overly optimistic. They tend to be very, very slow to change because lowering a target is a signal to the investment community that things have gone permanently sour."
RiskMetrics, a software analytics company based in New York that specializes in risk assessment for the financial community, recently conducted a study for Money & Business that examined 550 price targets assigned to some 300 technology stocks as of June 22. It looked at five major Wall Street firms' targets for companies in computer software, hardware and semiconductors, and calculated the probabilities that these targets would be met within the next 12 months. The firms are Goldman, Sachs; Merrill Lynch; Morgan Stanley Dean Witter; Prudential Securities; and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup.
Fewer than 1 percent of the price targets in the study were below the stocks' levels as of July 24. While many of the targets had a better than 50-50 probability of being met based on past price action, 46 companies carried targets that had less than a 20 percent chance of being hit. 
Consider a $50 price target on Inet Technologies, a communications software provider that closed at $9 on Friday. According to RiskMetrics, this stock has an 11 percent chance of reaching that price. An $80 target on Orbotech, a maker of optical inspection systems that closed on Friday at $26.35, has a 17 percent likelihood of being met. "There's no consistency even within a brokerage house in the creation of a price target," said Michael Thompson, RiskMetrics' global market commentator. "Too many times, these things come out of the air."
The RiskMetric study showed that the Prudential analysts had the highest percentage of price targets that were most likely to be reached -- 67 percent. Salomon Smith Barney took second place with 64 percent, followed by Merrill Lynch at 58 percent and Morgan Stanley at 57 percent. Goldman was last, at 49 percent. 
A word of caution on these figures: this study was focused on one sector of the economy and based on data collected without the firms' help. The results could be quite different for research in other sectors.
Ed Canaday, a spokesman for Goldman, said target prices are based on a moment in time and are not intended to be continuous, because so much about a stock can change.
So why do firms keep outlandish targets on stocks? The answer may be akin to the reason Wall Street issue so few sell ratings: the fear of losing investment banking business. 
The firms deny that price targets are used to draw in banking business or to keep clients happy. But in the RiskMetrics study, in more than one-fourth of the cases when stocks carried an outlandish price target from a brokerage firm, that broker underwrote shares or provided other investment banking services for the company. 
Individual investors should do as their institutional brethren do and pay no heed to price targets. As RiskMetrics' Mr. Thompson said, "We've got to stop the mumbo jumbo that's really not based on anything terribly meaningful."

HEADLINE: The World; 
The Route to Real Safety May Be the Open Road

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
AMERICAN truck drivers and their union, along with a number of Democrats and Republicans, have been battling to keep Mexican trucks in Mexico. In doing so, they have shaped the debate so that it seems to be about safety and not protectionism. But another way to think about it is as a fight over economic power and how to use it in a rapidly globalizing world.
 The fundamental premise behind international trade pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement is that when countries work together, the result of their combined efforts is greater than what any of them could deliver to their people by controlling their economies alone. In other words, under this theory, the best way to stronger, more equitable economies is not by relying on traditional methods of sovereign control, in which strong powers dictate to weak ones, often sowing resentment, resistance and retribution. 
 Rather, nations in cross-border compacts knowingly cede some control over how their economies work in exchange for advantages like open access and equality of treatment that are supposed to level the playing field for everyone. And that, in turn, increases trade and spreads the wealth. 
That's been the theory, anyway. Now, as the agreements begin to mature, it is becoming clearer that power is not shared equally. And so the strongest members, when they worry about surrendering sovereignty, may be worrying for nothing. Their economic might, it turns out, is often not diminished at all, but simply transformed into a kind of stealth power, enabling them to exert even greater influence and achieve broader goals.
Take the border ban. The truckers want the United States to use power in the old way to keep out Mexicans drivers and their rigs, requiring them to undergo special safety inspections on the premise that many are unsafe. Underlying this is a calculation that this gives the American trucking industry, and its drivers, a more secure future. The decision by the United States, dating to the Clinton administration, to ignore the provisions of Nafta that would have freed long-haul trucks from Mexico, the United States and Canada -- the third leg of the Nafta trinity -- to cross the borders unhindered, clearly violates the agreement that took effect in 1994. And, in the minds of many experts, it is also likely to hurt the American trucking fleet more than it helps it. 
What often gets overlooked, these experts say, is that the border ban is reciprocal -- and that the American trucking industry is in a position to play that to its own advantage. Aaron Dichter, Mexico's under secretary for transportation, said American trucks operating in Mexico face the same restriction as Mexican trucks in the United States. They can cross the border but cannot leave a narrow commercial zone that extends no more than 20 miles. Like Mexican drivers on the other side, they drop loads at transfer points, from which domestic trucks and drivers complete the delivery. 
Mexican trucking executives say that even if border blockades are lifted by the end of this year, as President Bush has promised, only a few of the biggest Mexican rigs could make deliveries deep into the United States. The patchwork of regulations, including a requirement that trucks be licensed in every state where they operate, intimidates most truckers. 
WHAT is most likely to happen, say Mexico experts like George W. Grayson of the College of William and Mary, is that the better-financed and more competitive American trucking outfits will enter the growing Mexican market either through joint ventures or in head-to-head competition. "I'd be surprised if, two or three years after the border was opened, 80 to 85 percent of long hauls from Mexico weren't handled by the U.S. trucking fleet," Professor Grayson said. 
Of course, this example echoes the basic argument for the efficiencies of global trade that have been put forward by all recent American presidents, from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush. "If you relax your total control, you can more effectively enhance your economy and your development," said Robert A. Pastor, an Emory University political scientist and former member of the National Security Council. 
In the old days, when bashing the United States was a stock in trade for many Latin American populists, Mexico built walls around its economy to keep from being smothered by the United States. But those walls didn't feed their people. However much that protectionism gratified Mexican nationalists, "they found themselves deteriorating behind the walls and eventually had to dismantle them," Professor Pastor said. As a result, since Nafta came into effect in 1994, exports from Mexico have grown faster than from any other nation. But in the same period, American investments in almost every sector of the Mexican economy have grown too. 
Similarly, Canada has long resented American arrogance and for many years tried to keep the United States out. In the 1970's, the nationalist government of Pierre Trudeau severely limited foreign investment in Canadian oil and controlled prices. Exploration and drilling all but stopped, and the industry stagnated. 
After entering free trade agreements with the United States, Canada lost the power to erect such obstacles. But its energy exports have boomed, and it is now the United States' No. 1 foreign supplier of oil and natural gas.
Pierre S. Pettigrew, Canada's minister of international trade, sees the growth of American power and accepts it because of the benefits it brings Canada. "There are certain things that can no longer be legislated because we've signed international agreements," he said. "But in so doing, the U.S. ends up being even more powerful because you have another kind of relationship that is growing, that is developing, that is strengthening all elements of the three countries." 
While such a system produces winners in all three countries, it also produces friction, especially when it seems that a state's sovereignty has been compromised. Mr. Pettigrew was in Washington last week to meet with his American and Mexican counterparts to tinker with the part of Nafta that gives unelected tribunals the power to secretly resolve disputes between international investors and governments. 
Still, most nations -- including the United States under President Bush -- are eager to join international trade agreements, if only as a measure of self-protection against the growing power of competing trade blocs in other areas, like the European Union.
THAT doesn't mean, however, that the Bush administration likes all international agreements to the same degree, especially compacts that are not about trade. President Bush has steadfastly refused to submit to international agreements like the Kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases, the small-arms control pact and other treaties. The inconsistency has angered allies and given opponents issues to focus on. 
"The White House should follow its own advice consistently," said one, Thomas F. McLarty III, who was President Clinton's chief of staff. "It's pretty clear that in an interconnected world, the U.S. is going to have to engage with, and not dictate, to our partners."
In contrast to the Clinton administration's approach to international agreements, the current administration clearly prefers to pick only those compacts where surrendering control may actually increase American economic power, while passing on those that simply acknowledge the globe's interconnectedness.

HEADLINE: Sunday Q&A 

 BODY:
 Sunday Q & A appears in this section weekly. Readers are invited to send in questions about national or international affairs; those selected will be answered by Times correspondents who specialize in those issues. Information about submitting questions appears below.

Collateral Effect of Atomic Explosions

Q. Recent talks between India and Pakistan bring up the question of possible use of nuclear weapons. If there were, say, 2 to 20 atomic explosions in that part of the world, aside from the disastrous consequences at the point of detonation, what would be the likely effects on other continents?

A. James Glanz, a science correspondent for The Times, responds:
 By breaking a taboo that has existed for more than half a century, a nuclear exchange of that magnitude would make the world an infinitely more dangerous place and lead to consequences no one could foresee. With millions dead by blast, fire and radiation poisoning on the Indian subcontinent, civilizations there could collapse into chaos, potentially destabilizing governments around the globe.
The physical effects outside the region would be the least of the world's worries -- assuming the horrific situation did not spark nuclear war elsewhere. Before 1963, when a treaty banned the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, radioactive strontium, a fission byproduct, wafted around the globe and generated international outrage. Closer to the explosions, a radioactive isotope of iodine rained from the sky onto plants eaten by cows and goats, which then produced radioactive milk. Those distressing episodes would be replayed in the wake of a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.
The global economic consequences of such a disaster are incalculable. The world would somehow have to intervene to help more than a billion people whose governments had neglected their interests in the most repugnant way imaginable.
Finally, the United States and other Western countries would rightly fear that the end of the nuclear taboo would mean an increase in proliferation, possibly leading to an era in which nuclear terrorism became a credible threat. The effect of a shadow that dark on humanity's fortunes is beyond reckoning.

The Meaning of the Five Olympic Rings

Q. What is the origin of the five-circle Olympic logo?

A. Jere Longman, a sports reporter for The Times who has covered eight Olympics, responds:
The five interlocking Olympic rings symbolize the union of the original continents that participated in the modern Games -- Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe -- as well as the meeting of the athletes from those continents, according to the United States Olympic Committee. Baron Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Games in 1896, designed the symbol in 1913.
The five colors of the rings, always appearing in the same order from top to bottom and left to right, are blue, black, red, yellow and green. The colors chosen by the International Olympic Committee no longer carry a special meaning, although previously, at least one of the five colors was found in the national flag of every nation participating in the Olympic movement.

The Ins and Outs of Warning Labels

Q. Why are there so many consumer warnings on products sold in the United States, and why do the admonishments on so many of them seem so obvious?

A. Greg Winter, a consumer products correspondent for The Times, responds:
 Consumers are filing fewer product liability cases than they have in years, but the fear of them is still strong. Many consumer product manufacturers put warning labels on their products just to make sure they are not vulnerable to lawsuits.
Of course, some of those warnings would appear to be self-evident, and few of them are actually required by the government. But regulators often suggest, sometimes quite strongly, that manufacturers put them on anyway, even if they seem obvious. 
The way most government agencies see it, intelligence, or even common sense, is not a prerequisite for buying, so leaving it to the consumer to figure out what is safe is merely an invitation to more accidents. For many a regulator, protecting consumers has little to do with having faith in them. 
Still, most warnings are voluntary, and in some cases they are actually a mixed blessing for consumers. Take the trend to adding words like "may contain peanuts" on a number of foods, particularly cookies, candies and other products with nuts. The disclaimer is meant to protect people with food allergies, who sometimes die from eating just a small amount of everyday ingredients that most consumers take for granted. 
That would seem to be a service to allergic consumers, especially because specks of nuts often get into products where they are not supposed to be, usually without the manufacturer's knowledge. But as more and more companies slap these warning labels on their foods, shoring up against lawsuits, people with food allergies complain that they are left with fewer and fewer things to eat. 
Allergic consumers complain that instead of actually making sure their products do not have nuts or other undisclosed ingredients, manufacturers are taking the easy way out, protecting themselves at the expense of those who most rely on their diligence.

HEADLINE: Drug Use Begetting AIDS in Central Asia 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: TEMIRTAU, Kazakhstan 

 BODY:
The five nations of Central Asia may be at the brink of an explosive growth in AIDS, medical experts and government officials say.
 "There is a growing drug trade, declining standards of living and social chaos," said Jay Dobkin, director of the AIDS program at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, who has visited the region three times in recent months. "It's hard to know if there is going to be an explosion, but it's smarter not to wait and see." 
 So far, the official number of people with AIDS or who are H.I.V. positive is relatively low in most of the countries -- Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan -- but experts believe the figures are underreported. 
Two decades after AIDS began taking its toll on the rest of the world, these isolated nations -- all formerly republics of the Soviet Union -- are still hobbled by taboos, meager resources and authoritarian bureaucracies. They have been slow to develop programs to counter the steep rise in drug abuse and to educate people about AIDS. 
In Kyrgyzstan the government allots just $26,500 for AIDS prevention and awareness programs, and throughout the area there are almost no treatment centers. 
In June the United Nations concluded there was a basis for more people getting AIDS in all five countries. It cited the rapid increase in drug use, high levels of sexually transmitted diseases, widespread prostitution and a population with more than half its people under 25.
Oxsana, 27, said she started using drugs seven years ago, at the age of 20, here in Temirtau. There was nothing to do, she said. "I decided to try with my friends the first time," she said. "It was easy to buy drugs." 
By the time she started using a mixture of opium and flour in 1994, there were plenty of abandoned apartments where drug users would congregate. Nobody had heard of AIDS in Temirtau and, as in the culture of drugs elsewhere, they shared needles. 
The specter of AIDS follows the path of heroin and opium trafficking from Afghanistan to Kazakhstan and its Central Asian neighbors, all of which are way stations for drugs headed to Russia and Europe. 
As inevitably happens, transit countries have turned into user countries. Where there were almost no intravenous drug users a decade ago, today there are an estimated 300,000 among the region's 55 million people. 
In Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, the most fragile and poorest countries in the region, a full-blown AIDS crisis could overwhelm medical resources and cause political and social instability, experts warn. For now, the crisis is worst in Kazakhstan, a nation of 17 million people.
The United Nations estimates that 3,500 people here are H.I.V. positive or have AIDS; the Kazakhstan government puts the figure at 1,700 and unofficial estimates are as high as 10,000. Official figures put the totals at about 100 people in each of the other four countries in the region, though those figures are also thought to be low. 
Ground zero is Temirtau, a city of 160,000 in central Kazakhstan. It is a laboratory for the effects of the social and economic woes that swept across the region like a medieval plague after the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. 
Temirtau was built during World War II, to produce steel using coal from nearby mines. When the Soviet Union collapsed, so did the city's economy and the social institutions. Almost overnight, people were trapped by unemployment, poverty, crime and disillusionment. 
Temirtau, near the primary road from Afghanistan to Russia, proved fertile territory for the drug business. Some people sold drugs to survive; more used them to cope. 
Oxsana's boyfriend, Sasha, a 28-year-old intravenous drug user who still manages to hold onto his job at a steel plant, said drugs are easy to find and cheap to buy. After eight years of using opium, he said he needs about $3 a day to maintain a level mood, more to get high. 
Sasha and Oxsana have watched many friends die from AIDS. There is no rehabilitation program to help them get off drugs, but they visit a city-run needle-exchange program to get free syringes and condoms. 
The center, in a converted kindergarten, financed by the United Nations and a local steel company, provides checkups and some medication for people with AIDS or who are H.I.V. positive. Space and resources are limited and there is no treatment capacity.
No one is sure how the virus that causes AIDS came to this isolated town on the steppes. 
Abdygaliev Berik, the deputy mayor, and Svetlana Krukovskaya, a supervisor at the AIDS center, said the prevailing theory is that a businessman contracted the virus in Moscow and brought it back here. 
The first known case in Temirtau was discovered in 1996 when a drug user was arrested and tested. Since then the number of cases has grown and the latest figures show that 918 people are H.I.V. positive, nearly 1 in 1,600, and 106 have died of AIDS-related illnesses. 
Experts are convinced AIDS is equally severe elsewhere in Kazakhstan. Most cases are discovered when drug users and prostitutes are arrested and tested. Temirtau is the only place where international attention led to widespread testing of the general population. 
"H.I.V. and AIDS in Kazakhstan are not just in Temirtau, unfortunately," said Valeriya Gourevich, a doctor who runs a public health program in Almaty, the country's most populous city with 1.2 million people. The program is sponsored by the New York-based Soros Foundation. 
She listed six other cities, from Aktobe in oil-rich western Kazakhstan to Pavlodar near the Russian border in the northeast and Shymkent in the south, where heavy drug use indicates widespread AIDS. 
In Kazakhstan, 80 percent of those found to be H.I.V. positive are intravenous drug users, experts say. But data from Temirtau presented at a United Nations conference in June found an increasing percentage of cases transmitted by sexual activity. The disclosure alarmed experts because it indicates drug users are spreading the virus to spouses and lovers, increasing the potential for an epidemic. 
The risk of contracting AIDS is high throughout Central Asia partly because deeply rooted attitudes prevent appropriate education and preventive techniques, said Dr. Gourevich. Parents rarely discuss sex with children and cases sexually transmitted diseases are increasing sharply.
Evgenia Misurevich, 26, was one of the first people in Temirtau to find out she was H.I.V. positive. She said she had never heard of the virus or AIDS before she got it in 1996 from sharing a needle. 
Drugs first arrived in Temirtau a decade ago and Ms. Misurevich said she was eager to try them. "It was a new thing and we thought it was cool," she said.
She said she got the virus from a cellmate in prison, where drug use was rampant. Ms. Misurevich was serving a four-year sentence for theft to support her drug habit.
"I understood something was wrong when the doctor said I needed to go to a separate cell," she said, waiting for a checkup in the bleak examining room of the AIDS center. 
Ms. Misurevich stopped using drugs after contracting the virus in prison. But she said she returned to drug use when she was released last year, though she said she used her own needle. Five months ago, she entered a rehabilitation program run by the Roman Catholic Church, one of two religion-based rehabilitation programs in the country of 17 million. She said she is drug-free and feels well. 
Despite the highest incidence of AIDS in the region, Kazakhstan has no government-operated treatment centers. 
The situation is the same in Almaty, 600 miles south. Medical officials said there is no place where people who are H.I.V. positive or have AIDS can get treatment and few education programs. 
Dr. Dobkin of Columbia-Presbyterian said a bureaucracy has grown up around the issue without taking concrete steps to tackle AIDS yet. "There are a lot of people with AIDS on their business cards, but I couldn't find any evidence of anybody getting any treatment," he said. 
"We have never figured out what leads to an epidemic in one place and not others, but there is no time to waste here."

HEADLINE: Dallas Bleeds as Job Cuts Rake Tech Sector 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: RICHARDSON, Tex., Aug. 3 

 BODY:
Early last year, with the Dallas area unemployment rate hovering at about 3 percent, companies in the Telecom Corridor here in the northern suburbs were so frantic to lure talent that one of them asked whether it could pay professors at the University of Texas at Dallas $5,000 for each recruit, said the school's engineering and computer science dean, William P. Osborne. "I said: 'It's a free country. I can't stop you from doing that, but I'm absolutely opposed.' "
 But now, pink slips are being handed out like last year's signing bonuses. With the severe downturn in telecommunications that began late last year, the flow of cash from investors and orders from customers has ceased, throwing out of work thousands of prosperous employees who had never likened their job security to working at a dot-com. The local unemployment rate in June stood at 4.2 percent, still moderate but up 50 percent, from 2.8 percent, in six months, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. 
 Compared with the rest of Texas, Dallas has always had a fairly diversified economy, with plenty of jobs in financial services, real estate, transportation, retail and energy. In recent years, the region has also capitalized on the nation's technology boom, establishing in Richardson a niche for designing, building and selling telecommunications gear. 
Since the end of last year, however, more than 10,000 Dallas-area high-technology employees have lost their jobs, industry officials say, most of them in and around Richardson at companies including Nortel Networks, Alcatel and Ericsson. The region's experience illustrates how the carnage from the collapse of the corporate spending-and-investment binge, led by technology, has spread far beyond places like Austin and Silicon Valley.
Today's unemployment report indicated that across the nation, corporations continued to cut their payrolls in July, although the unemployment rate was steady. Economists are debating whether the continuing cutbacks in corporate spending, especially on technology, will leave the economy at a standstill, or worse. 
The economic reversal has been especially abrupt for victims like Denny Buck, 50, who made a six-figure salary working at Alcatel, the French telecommunications giant, which has announced about 1,400 layoffs here in the last four months. Mr. Buck fears he might have to sell his house if he does not find work. He has some optimism, but he notes there are now thousands of similarly skilled people in his predicament. "It doesn't help to have all those people battling for the same jobs," he said. 
Fiona Sigalla, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, confirms that Mr. Buck is not alone. "High tech in general -- but telecom in particular -- provided a tremendous positive stimulus for economic growth here during the last five years," she said. But with the telecommunications bust, "we've gone from having an industry hiring rapidly and building lots of space to an industry contracting and laying off large numbers of people." 
In Texas, as in much of the country, technology has become an increasingly important part of the economy. In the state's electrical and electronic equipment industries, total industrial production has soared 125 percent since 1987, according to the Dallas Fed. By comparison, oil and gas extraction experienced only a 4.9 percent gain over the same period. 
The telecommunications industry's sharp downturn helps explain the rise in the nation's unemployment rate over the last year, from 3.9 percent in October to 4.5 percent last month. Across Texas, the June unemployment rate stood at 4.6 percent, according to the Dallas Fed, up from 3.7 percent at year-end.
As one of the nation's more rapidly growing areas, Dallas is likely to continue to outperform much of the nation, economists say. "Dallas is large enough and diverse enough to withstand this, particularly if this is temporary, and we think it will be," said Ray Perryman, head of an economic consulting firm in Waco, halfway between Austin and Dallas.
He predicts the region's economic output will grow 3.5 percent annually over the next few years while employment grows at slightly more than 2 percent, aided by gains in businesses including those that support aviation and international trade. That growth is "well below the last couple of years, but a lot of cities would love to have it," Mr. Perryman said.
But in addition to the layoffs, there are other clear signs of the industry's retrenchment affecting the region. Office vacancy rates in Richardson and neighboring Plano have more than doubled in the last year, to 14 percent from 6 percent, according to Tracy Fults, an executive director in the Dallas office of Kennedy-Wilson International, a real estate firm. 
Tenants in the two cities have vacated about 580,000 square feet of office space, the rough equivalent of a 30-story office building, since the beginning of the year, and plans for another 450,000 square feet have been stalled, Mr. Fults said. 
Last year, for example, Cisco Systems announced plans for a seven-building campus in Richardson. But the company recently scaled back those plans, putting two of the buildings on hold, and said it would build, but not occupy, one of the others.
Similarly, venture capital investment in Dallas has plunged, in line with a nationwide pattern. In the second quarter, Dallas companies received $176 million in venture capital investment in 17 deals, according to VentureWire, a New York firm that tracks venture capital investment. In the period last year, Dallas companies got $469 million in 37 deals.
The Dallas area's emergence as a telecommunications center goes back to the early 1980's. Richardson was uniquely prepared to capitalize on the breakup of American Telephone and Telegraph. It boasted not only Texas Instruments, which remains one of the largest employers, but also Collins Radio, then a division of Rockwell International, which specialized in military telecommunications and was one of the few companies that had technological sophistication to rival AT&T's. 
Civic and business leaders had also worked to establish a new branch of the state university system, the University of Texas at Dallas, to train technology workers. Situated in Richardson, the university is now one of the largest producers of computer science graduates. In all, more than 600 technology companies are within five miles of the school, employing more than 80,000 workers.
But their rapid growth ended abruptly last year, as the flow of capital from Wall Street ceased while large companies curtailed spending on telecommunications equipment. Some customers pushed large amounts of inventory back to their suppliers. 
"The basic problem was manufacturers were building and service providers were buying and installing on forecasts for demand that just could not go on forever," said Dean Osborne, who believes an industry rebound could be a year or more away. "You won't see the telecom industry have this bad a downturn again in our lifetime."
One of the region's business leaders, however, said that the impact of the cutbacks might be overstated because as many as 40 percent of those who have been laid off have found new jobs in the industry. 
"There is a perception in the tech world that nobody is hiring, but I don't think that's true here," said Ron Robinson, who as president of the Technology Business Council, a trade group in Richardson, has played a large role in luring new employers. In particular, many small companies are hiring, he said. 
But at after-work retreats like Nedley's, a bar and restaurant here, farewell gatherings have replaced the celebrations of a year or two ago for co-workers who had landed jobs with promising start-ups. 
Employees who are stunned to find they have lost their jobs often want to go out for drinks with their colleagues, said Ned Gilblom, the restaurant's owner. "If they just drop the bomb on them," he said, "they say, 'We need to go to a bar.' " His lunch business, he added, is off 30 percent. 
Many of those laid off this year have been socked with another setback as the value of their past compensation -- much of it based on shares of company stock, including 401(k)'s -- has plunged. "I know friends who have lost millions; it's awful," said Stephanie Schweizer, 36, who was laid off by Nortel Networks in April after six years with the company and has yet to find another job. Shares of Nortel, which closed Friday at $8.04, have fallen 90 percent in the last year.
Until recently, Ms. Schweizer said she had considered her job secure. "I never thought telecom was going to go away," she said. "We were a family. We were just soaring. Everyone was making their numbers. It was just such a positive place to work." 
Recently, she ran into a former co-worker who had taken a job selling women's clothes at a local mall. "It's really sad to see someone basically be reduced to working as if they had never gotten a college degree," she said. "It's like a death. Every day, I'm talking to people about who is on the chopping block next."

HEADLINE: CNN Aims at Young Viewers As It Revamps News Format 

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG 

 BODY:
To hear AOL Time Warner executives talk about their plans to revamp CNN's Headline News, you might think they were talking about plans to start a music channel. 
 They have promised splashier graphics, a multisectioned screen that resembles a Web site, background music of techno and alternative rock guitar. The channel has been promoted in commercials featuring Moby, the D.J. and singer, and New Order, the alternative pop band. 
 One anchor will be Andrea Thompson, until last year an actress on "NYPD Blue," who was hired by CNN after spending 11 months in a local news boot camp in New Mexico, where she gained her only professional experience in journalism.
The changes at Headline News, shepherded by two Hollywood entertainment executives and scheduled to begin Monday, are among the most aggressive attempts in television news to lure a younger audience. The reason behind the revamping reflects a fundamental problem for TV news divisions: their audience tends to be older but television is increasingly driven by advertisers demanding a younger audience. The median age of Headline News viewers this year is about 54; CNN's is 64. 
The issue has become an urgent one for the news divisions, whose corporate parents are increasingly under pressure to produce financial growth. But it also raises a tricky question: How do you reach younger people, many of them weaned on MTV, without alienating the core older viewers?
How Headline News bridges the divide will be closely watched in the television industry. Headline News is much like all-news radio, giving quick reports on the major stories. The channel will continue to report breaking news and give viewers the crucial headlines of the moment. But it will also place greater emphasis on entertainment, health and fitness, the environment and technology, with in-studio correspondents who specialize in these subjects.
It will be easy to trip up. Networks trying similar strategies have at times been ridiculed. ABC News drew the scorn of critics and had a near-revolt among its staff in the spring of 2000 when it featured the actor Leonardo DiCaprio as the host of a prime-time special on the environment. He even interviewed President Bill Clinton. In ratings parlance, it bombed.
But CNN says the new Headline News will be more subtle and alluring. "What we're trying to do is be more fascinating, be a little broader in our definition of what's interesting to people and attract people of all ages, period," said Walter Isaacson, the new CNN chairman and former editorial director of Time Inc.
The new look was not developed by Mr. Isaacson, who only signed on at CNN last month. Mr. Isaacson, however, applied the same theory to Time magazine, and is believed to have given it a greater youth appeal.
CNN's new approach was developed with help from two executives who have specialized in teasing younger viewers to television sets -- Jamie Kellner and Garth Ancier. Mr. Kellner, the chief executive of Turner Broadcasting System -- the AOL Time Warner division that oversees CNN -- led the Fox and WB networks, which brought to television "The Simpsons" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer." Mr. Ancier, the new Turner executive vice president, was a top programmer at both networks, as well as the president of NBC Entertainment.
Still, CNN executives said they did not expect too many in Generation Y to tune in. They said they were mostly aiming at those on the older side of Generation X, in the 35 range, and baby boomers.
The main bet is that younger viewers want news fast, to fit their busy lives. So reports will be short and fast-paced. The screen will be bordered by panels with bits of information all at once -- weather, stock indexes, quick headlines -- in a more extreme version of the Internet-style information bars on the Fox News Channel, MSNBC and CNN.
Last month, at a gathering of television reporters and critics in Pasadena, Calif., Turner Broadcasting executives introducing the new network look were heckled over its fast pace and busy screen. But Mr. Kellner argued back. Mr. Kellner, 54, acknowledged that the new style might not appeal to older viewers. "People my age," he said, "are going to have a harder time, maybe, buying in. But my 29-year-old daughter is going to sit there glued to it, and it's going to be servicing her needs to get a lot of different information."
By the standards of television news, a 29-year-old is a spring hatchling. The median age of the audience for the television news generally hovers around 60 and above. 
In years past, the age of the news audience was not much of an issue. But advertising executives have put a growing premium on younger viewers, who they say are more open to messages but harder than ever to reach because they have so many new media choices while leading very busy lives. Corporate owners, meanwhile, under pressure from Wall Street to increase revenue and profit, are less willing to exempt their news divisions from the forces of the marketplace.
And while news divisions could once rest easy in the knowledge that the apathetic young people would tune in eventually, when they had families and more income and a greater stake in society, that is no longer the case. The younger generations now have a wealth of options for news, from the Internet to the Comedy Central channel's "The Daily Show With Jon Stewart," a nightly satire that became such a source for campaign news last fall that Nielsen, the predominant audience measurement service, included it in its ratings report for election night.
"I think that there is more awareness of the demographic performance of news programs on the part of news people, certainly," said Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News. "And on the part of parent companies, too, than there was five years ago. That's to some degree the increasingly businesslike scrutiny that news divisions operate under."
Mr. Heyward said that pressure might be increasing with the success this last year of so-called reality programs like CBS's "Survivor," which have done exceptionally well with younger viewers -- proving to the news divisions' corporate parents that younger people can be drawn to nonfiction programming if it is tailored to their tastes.
In fact, the CBS morning news program, "The Early Show," has relied heavily on coverage of "Survivor" to increase its younger audience, which, Mr. Heyward said, has helped it significantly raise revenue.
Driving the strategy of news executives is their belief that younger viewers -- who came of age in the relatively peaceful times and prolonged economic growth of the 1990's -- are not as interested in traditional news areas like Washington politics and foreign affairs.
MSNBC's more straightforward evening news program, "The News With Brian Williams," draws an older audience than do the network's feature programs, like the biography program "Headliners and Legends" (among this past week's subjects were the actresses Halle Berry and Elizabeth Montgomery) or "MSNBC Investigates" (last Tuesday night featured the murder of a Los Angeles police officer who became a strip club mogul.) They have helped give MSNBC the youngest of the news audiences, with a median age of about 51.
Network news traditionalists often scoff at MSNBC's approach as pandering. But Erik Sorenson, the MSNBC president and general manager, said that television news must accommodate the needs of baby boomers and Generation X.
"For our parents' and grandparents' generation, it was relatively straightforward," he said. "We were in a dangerous cold-war era, our shores were not considered safe, we could still remember the Depression so the actions of our government in Washington were crucial."
The younger generations, he said, "grew up much more skeptical of Washington, feeling less threatened, much more secure, both economically and physically, and we have a much broader definition of what's relevant."
The experiment at Headline News, however, involves a very different sort of beast -- one that has essentially served as a generic wire service of straightforward news reports whose viewers may be scared off by all the pizazz. 
CNN, however, seems to believe it can afford to experiment with Headline News, available in 78 million homes. Though the network remains profitable because of its low expenses -- it uses the news produced by its larger sibling CNN -- the audience for Headline News, has declined in recent years. At any given time its average audience has 170,000 people, down from 219,000 people in 1996. CNN's is 319,000 so far this year.
So AOL Time Warner executives hardly seemed upset by all the criticism they received for hiring Ms. Thompson, the actress, as an anchor -- even after nude photographs taken of her years ago for a 1986 film, "Manhattan Gigolo," surfaced on the Internet last spring. After all, attention is attention.
At the Pasadena news conference, Ms. Thompson, 41, was asked if she thought her experience on "NYPD Blue" helped her get the Headline News job. "Certainly I am not a seasoned journalist," she said. "If my stardom or past has something to do with that, then what I say is, you know what? Use me, baby."

HEADLINE: New Melting Pot of Museums Downtown; 
A Cultural Hub Takes Shape in Manhattan's Oldest Quarter

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
Never mind the Met, the Frick, the Guggenheim. New York's new Museum Mile is taking shape from Chambers Street to State Street.
 With little fanfare, Lower Manhattan has become a cultural destination in its own right, coming out of a strong economy and capitalizing on the growing popular interest in heritage and history. A dozen museums are now operating, and several important ones will be arriving in the next few years. 
 In fact, keep the Guggenheim in mind. It may end up as the 800-pound, titanium-skinned gorilla on the downtown museum scene, providing a critical cultural mass that has not yet been reached, though it certainly feels close. 
"There's a significant synergy when you have cultural institutions within walking distance," said David G. Marwell, director of the Museum of Jewish Heritage -- A Living Memorial to the Holocaust, which opened in 1997 at Battery Park City. "People can plan an entire day around them."
It seems almost inevitable that the oldest quarter of New York should emerge as a museum nexus, something more than a stopping-off point on the way to the top of the World Trade Center or over to Liberty and Ellis Islands. Served by almost every subway line, Lower Manhattan is compact and eminently strollable, its bewildering ancient street patchwork rendered more navigable with way-finding signs installed by the Alliance for Downtown New York.
Hotels are opening. Restaurants and stores are doing business on weekends. It is even possible to see a movie without using a MetroCard.
Though no one seriously proposes that Lower Manhattan will soon overtake the Upper East Side as a destination for cultural tourism, it has some special advantages in being wrapped by waterfront.
"We have boat models that are 300 feet long," noted Peter A. Aron, trustee and chairman emeritus of the South Street Seaport Museum.
Lower Manhattan also has a form of transportation unavailable along Fifth Avenue. Three percent of visitors to the Museum of Jewish Heritage arrive by ferry, said Abby R. Spilka, the director of communications. "I dare the Metropolitan Museum of Art to give you that statistic," she said.
Another distinct characteristic is that almost every museum downtown is historically connected in some way to the building it occupies or the land on which it stands. "We have heritage down here," said Valerie Lewis, assistant vice president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, which runs the Lower Manhattan Business Improvement District. "That's our niche."
And this seems to be the moment for heritage. "New Yorkers are coming to understand and appreciate that they do have a history," said Robert R. Macdonald, director of the Museum of the City of New York, which is planning to move from the Upper East Side to the Tweed Courthouse behind City Hall in two years.
John Haworth, director of the George Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the American Indian, has noted many visitors from Brazil, France, Germany, Britain, Canada and Mexico. "There's a lot of interest in what's really American," Mr. Haworth said.
The Heye Center (pronounced "high") is a branch of the Smithsonian Institution that sprawls through the Beaux-Arts chambers of the former United States Custom House on Bowling Green. As it happens, this marks the end of what was once the Wiechquaekeck Trail, an important Algonquian trading route.
A cultural hub unto itself, the Heye Center is currently presenting Seth Eastman's watercolors of the Dakota, decorated Plains Indian shirts and a show examining the relation between American Indians and the medium of photography.
The museum moved in 1994 from Audubon Terrace at Broadway and 155th Street, where 35,000 people visited a year. "We attract that many visitors in a month down here," Mr. Haworth said.
Audubon Terrace will soon be losing another institution, the American Numismatic Society, to Lower Manhattan.
Early next year, the society will move into the seven-story former Fidelity and Deposit Company Building at 140 William Street, on the corner of Fulton Street, where it plans to build its own museum.
For the next five years, beginning Oct. 18, the society will present "Drachmas, Doubloons and Dollars: The History of Money" in a 5,000-square-foot exhibition space at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at 33 Liberty Street.
By December, the New York City Police Museum will have moved out of the former Cunard Building at 25 Broadway and into its own home in the former First Precinct station house at 100 Old Slip, on the East River, where it will have 8,000 square feet of exhibition space.
Also by the end of the year, a designer may have been chosen for the Museum of Women: the Leadership Center, cater-corner from the Museum of Jewish Heritage, said Timothy S. Carey, president of the Battery Park City Authority.
In March 2002, the Irish Hunger Memorial will open in Battery Park City. Though not strictly a museum, the 96-by-170-foot installation will have a real 19th-century stone cottage from Attymass, Ireland, as the centerpiece of a landscape meant to evoke the Irish countryside. It was designed by Brian Tolle, 1100 Architects and Gail Eileen Wittwer.
The authority also plans to set aside 3,000 to 4,000 square feet in a future development to serve as a world hunger information center, Mr. Carey said.
Later in 2002, the Skyscraper Museum will open at the base of the Ritz-Carlton Downtown, on the third corner of Battery Park City's museum crossroads. This $7 million, 5,800-square-foot space, by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, will be the first true home of an institution that has bounced around the skyscrapers of Lower Manhattan since its opening four years ago.
The year 2003 should prove to be a cultural watershed for downtown.
In the fall, the Museum of the City of New York is to open in the Tweed Courthouse, which is nearing the end of a meticulous city-financed restoration. The museum will have up to 40,000 square feet of exhibition space, more than twice what it has at Fifth Avenue and 103rd Street. The design is by Ralph Appelbaum Associates and Cooper Robertson & Partners. There will be a restaurant, a gift shop and perhaps a visitors center in conjunction with NYC & Company, the convention and visitors bureau.
In September 2003, the Museum of Jewish Heritage plans to open a $60 million, 70,000-square-foot east wing to its existing museum, designed by the same architects, Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo & Associates. Within the new wing will be the Edmond J. Safra Hall for public programs like films, concerts, lectures, dramatic productions and discussions.
Toward the end of 2003, the South Street Seaport Museum plans to complete a $20 million renovation of Schermerhorn Row on Fulton Street and the adjacent A. A. Low Building. This 30,000-square-foot space, designed by Beyer Blinder Belle, is to house an ambitious permanent exhibition, "World Port New York." Also in 2003, the Heye Center will open a $3 million education center in a 6,400-square-foot space under the grand rotunda.
At that point, the Guggenheim proposal -- a cloudlike fantasy designed by Frank O. Gehry that would be constructed on connecting platforms over the East River -- will still be going through governmental review. The $678 million project would include a 570,000-square-foot building and more than six acres of public park and outdoor sculpture areas.
Big as it would be, the downtown Guggenheim is envisioned by Thomas Krens, director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, as the portal to something even larger, said Laurie Beckelman, deputy director for special projects.
Imagine new cultural sites on Governors Island, she said, and art galleries in the Port Authority pier sheds at the foot of Brooklyn Heights, all linked across the harbor by ferries or water taxis. "It will go beyond Manhattan," Ms. Beckelman said.
Which raises a question. How long is a Museum Nautical Mile?

HEADLINE: In Bronx Revival, Ferrer Is Credited With Only a Supporting Role 

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

 BODY:
A few steps from the South Bronx curbside where Fernando Ferrer kicked off his run for mayor sits the site of his childhood home -- the long-vanished wellspring, he says, of his campaign for the city's highest office.
 Mr. Ferrer left his childhood home, a five-story walk-up at 588 Fox Street, in 1965, moving with his mother and sister to a nicer apartment a few blocks away. Eleven years later, with thousands of people fleeing the crumbling borough, the first of four fires raced through the Fox Street building. In 1978, now gutted and charred, it was demolished and swept away. 
 "I saw my own neighborhood go up in smoke," said Mr. Ferrer, the Bronx borough president since 1987. "I took it personally. It really did ignite all that I'm about in public life." 
As he travels New York's four other boroughs in his quest to become mayor, Mr. Ferrer has taken much of the credit for the Bronx's renaissance. He is selling the image of the rebuilt borough as a model for serving "the other New York" that he says was left out of the city's economic surge of the 1990's. Mr. Ferrer promises that if elected, he will set aside $13 billion to build 150,000 homes and apartments over the next 10 years.
Mr. Ferrer's old building never came back, but Fox Street did, and so did the rest of the South Bronx. In a transformation that is now nearly legendary, the Bronx rebuilt itself, adding nearly 70,000 new or rebuilt homes since 1987. The exodus ended, too: since 1980, the Bronx's population has risen by more than 160,000 people.
There is once again a hum of activity on Fox Street, a long string of town houses and apartments framing a scene of commerce and commotion. Mr. Ferrer's old building may be gone, but in its place stands a modern, two-family town house in immaculate shape. "It's a touch of suburbia here," said Frances Nater, a retired nurse, whose home occupies the spot where Mr. Ferrer once lived.
Mr. Ferrer offers few specifics on his exact role in the Bronx's comeback, even though it is the central event of his political career. He tosses out mostly general statements. "I packed the pipeline tight with projects," Mr. Ferrer said during a recent interview. "I was in the middle of everything."
In fact, the reconstruction of the South Bronx was a sprawling and complicated undertaking, costing hundreds of millions of dollars and summoning the efforts of hundreds of people. Interviews with some of the central players suggest that in his 14 years as borough president, Mr. Ferrer was a relentless advocate for rebuilding the Bronx, though he lacked the power to direct the effort himself. He was not the star, say many people who worked with Mr. Ferrer at the time, but he was not on the sideline either.
"He could have been an impediment, but he was an asset," said former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who helped bring about the Bronx's renaissance in the 1980's. "He was cooperative." 
According to several of the players, when Mr. Ferrer became borough president in 1987, the most important decision affecting the future of his borough had already been made. The year before, the Koch administration had set aside more than $4 billion as part of a 10-year plan to rebuild the city's crumbling housing stock.
Over the next decade, as Mr. Ferrer reigned as borough president, the Koch administration and its successors channeled millions of dollars to neighborhood groups and developers willing to work in the area. When the dollars first began to flow, many of those neighborhood groups were made up of little more than pioneers and stubborn residents who refused to abandon their homes.
Today, 15 years after Mayor Koch's initial commitment, much of the Bronx's refurbished housing stock is still controlled by these once-informal groups. Their leaders give most of the credit for the Bronx's revival to themselves and to former Mayor Koch. Mr. Ferrer, they say, often played a supporting role, helping them negotiate with the city government and helping shape the projects to their desires.
"I give Koch a lot of credit; he set the money aside," said Ralph Porter, executive director of the Mid-Bronx Desperadoes, one of the early nonprofit groups, which now manages 1,170 units in 38 buildings across the South Bronx. "But Ferrer always fought for us."
After 1990, even blocking projects was largely beyond Mr. Ferrer's power. In that year, New York City significantly changed the structure of its government, and Mr. Ferrer -- along with the rest of the city's borough presidents -- saw much of his power stripped away. Mr. Ferrer's power in land-use decisions was reduced to a largely advisory role.
"He didn't oppose anything," said the Rev. Louis R. Gigante, founder of the Southeast Bronx Community Organization, or Sebco, which manages about 3,500 apartments. "Freddie's borough was destroyed. He wasn't going to turn down the money."
Still, Father Gigante and others who participated in the reconstruction of the South Bronx credit Mr. Ferrer with doing what he could with his relatively meager resources. Mr. Ferrer directed much of the money still at his disposal -- about $28 million over 14 years -- to renovate old apartments and build new ones.
Often Mr. Ferrer acted as a middleman, fending off the heavier-handed efforts of City Hall. In the late 1980's, when city planners were preparing to earmark buildings for exclusive occupancy by homeless people, Mr. Ferrer helped persuade the planners to allow for more diversity. And in the early 1990's, when city planners wanted to bulldoze much of a 33-block area near Yankee Stadium, Mr. Ferrer helped persuade City Hall to give way. He helped devise a new plan for the area, called Melrose Commons, that allowed the residents to stay put. Today, about 200 homes have been built or reconstructed, with 1,100 more in the works.
"The people in the area were really angry, and Freddie got the city to back off," said Harold DeRienzo, founder of the Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association, a South Bronx nonprofit group that renovated more than 2,000 apartments.
Many people also credit Mr. Ferrer with the wisdom to back off himself. Some of the people active in housing issues in the 1990's say that Mr. Ferrer rarely tried to delay projects or steer contracts to his friends. Some of the same housing experts point to Harlem as an example of where interference by elected officials sometimes derailed rebuilding. "In Harlem, they wanted to turn it into a political patronage operation," Mr. Koch said. "Freddie did not in any way. By not demanding, he got a larger share."
Mr. Ferrer, who now lives in Riverdale, says he sometimes returns to Fox Street to draw inspiration. The more permanent residents have taken notice.
Roberto Reyes, who lives at 546 Fox Street, recalled the afternoon four years ago when Mr. Ferrer stood on his back porch and listened to him complain about the junkyard behind his home. "Ferrer told me he would do something about it, and we shook hands," Mr. Reyes said, looking over the edge of his porch. "Two weeks later, they started building a shopping center."

HEADLINE: Few Local Issues at Anti-Immigrant Gathering 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SACHS and AL BAKER 

DATELINE: CENTEREACH, N.Y., Aug. 4 

 BODY:
An anti-immigration gathering drew only about 100 people here today for an educational conference that included speeches condemning illegal immigrants as invaders and criminals who are destroying suburban neighborhoods. 
 The turnout was a disappointment to members of the Sachem Quality of Life Organization, a Farmingville group that wants the government to deport illegal immigrants and end what it calls the "atrocities" the immigrants have brought to the suburbs. 
 About 30 minutes before the meeting was scheduled to begin, Ray Wysolmierski, a Sachem spokesman, was ebulliently predicting a rousing event. 
"It's going to be a great American moment," he said. "We're going to change history today." 
An hour later, he dismissed the small showing as unimportant. 
"People are symbolic," Mr. Wysolmierski said. "I don't care if I get one or 1,000."
Several years ago, the Sachem group started pressing municipal officials for help in controlling the day laborers who congregated on the streets of Farmingville waiting for work. It has since forged links with a number of the groups that led California's anti-immigrant movement in the mid-1990's and have been seeking a national platform ever since. 
The main speakers at the meeting represented the John Birch Society and several of the California groups, which describe Mexican immigrants as the front line of an occupying force. 
The groups have been struggling to revive the same passions about immigration that once fueled California's Proposition 187, which denied public schooling and other services to illegal immigrants. The 1994 proposition was passed by voters but was later rejected as unconstitutional by a federal court.
Now the anti-immigrant forces are focusing on proposals under discussion in Washington to allow illegal Mexican immigrants a chance to become legal residents. Several speakers, including members of the Sachem group, described the ideas as treason. 
"They are willing to sell our sovereignty to the highest bidder, and we all know who the highest bidder is: Mexico," said Barbara Coe, president of the right-wing California Citizens for Immigration Reform. 
She went on to refer to illegal immigrants as robbers and rapists. 
Estimates by demographers and the Immigration and Naturalization Service put the number of illegal immigrants in the United States at 6 million to 11 million. The majority of those are believed to be of Mexican descent. 
Most of the speakers here today, all veterans of the California immigration battles, framed their comments about illegal immigrants in terms of their state's politics. One, admitting that he knew little about New York, complained about the Los Angeles City Council to an audience that dwindled, over the course of the day, to about 30 people. 
Critics of the Sachem group said the attempt to make Farmingville a rallying point for a national anti-immigration movement would probably fail. 
"If you're talking about 1,500 Mexicans in Farmingville as a national issue, it's insane," said Edward Hernandez, who heads a group called Brookhaven Citizens for Peaceful Solutions. 
The concerns raised initially in Farmingville were legitimate, he said, but the Sachem group forfeited its place in any community dialogue by allying itself with contentious figures like Mrs. Coe. 
"You have to take them out of the equation because they've taken an extreme position that says there is no alternative but deportation," Mr. Hernandez said. 
The conflict over illegal immigrants that has roiled Farmingville over the past three years -- encapsulated in a bitter fight to block the building of a hiring hall for laborers -- reflects the demographic shifts occurring across the country as Hispanics settle in communities long unaccustomed to immigrants. 
While the numbers in places like Farmingville are not large, the influx of Hispanics has had a dramatic effect. In 1990, according to adjusted census figures, Hispanics made up just 6.7 percent of the Farmingville population. Ten years later, they represented 8.1 percent. 
Farmingville remains overwhelmingly white, but the changes have clearly unsettled many residents. The booming economy helped exacerbate the tensions by attracting an influx of illegal workers who ended up crammed into small apartments in residential neighborhoods. 
Tthe local issues played only a marginal role in the gathering today in a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in Centereach. Sachem leaders and their guest speakers instead framed the day-laborer dispute as a reflection of a government conspiracy to abandon the suburbs to an immigrant invasion and forfeit American sovereignty through globalization. 
Members of the John Birch Society sold pamphlets and books warning of a communist threat and a United Nations "crusade against God and family." 
Many speakers blamed the media, "ethnic special-interest lobbies" and liberals, among others, for the modest attendance. 
"When there's been a campaign to depict us as hatemongers and racists, it scares away a lot of people," said Glenn Spencer, director of the California-based American Patrol and one of the most outspoken proponents of the view that Mexico wants to invade the United States.
"They don't want to be associated in any way. I wouldn't be surprised if that had an effect on our turnout."

To the Editor:
Re "Unmasking the Poor," by Bob Herbert (column, July 30):
 It is not surprising to learn of the plight of the "millions upon millions" of poor people in America today. Mr. 
Herbert refers to Barbara Ehrenreich's adventure as she tried to survive working for $6 to $7 an hour. 
The reality, however, is that these people are not "hidden" and their day-to-day struggles exist. Perhaps television and newspapers should keep us informed of this crisis on a more regular basis. Instead of broadcasting programs like "Survivor," the networks could devote more time to genuine "reality" programs. 
My suggestion is to educate the "well-to-do" about the daily hardships of the poor that have been brought to light through the writing of Ms. Ehrenreich. Perhaps we'll learn that the poor are not hidden, just conveniently misplaced.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Those not moved by Barbara Ehrenreich's account of trying to live for two years on $6 or $7 an hour, discussed by Bob Herbert (column, July 30), need to check whether they have a caraway seed for a heart. 
 Her account should silence all arguments against raising the minimum wage and increasing food-stamp allotments; against companies that contract with cities and states having to pay a living wage of $10 to $12 an hour; against increased financing for early childhood programs and 24-hour day care; and against reforming Temporary Assistance to Needy Families so that it raises people out of poverty instead off just knocking them off the caseload file. 
For the poor, these programs are vital to survival. 
Ms. Ehrenreich's book should be required reading for every member of Congress. Maybe then it will be ready to pass legislation to lift the poor out of poverty.

PERSON: Richard N. Barton 

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
New Journey of a Travel Pioneer

BYLINE:  By JANE L. LEVERE 

 BODY:
FOR Richard N. Barton, the success of Expedia Inc., the online travel agency he created five years ago in Redmond, Wash., is not unlike the satisfaction of painting a house.
 It was on the opposite coast, in New Canaan, Conn., 10 years before he went into the travel business, that Mr. Barton discovered his entrepreneurial skills as he painted other people's homes during summer vacations. 
 "I had a crew of four, including myself," Mr. Barton, 34, said in a recent telephone interview. "It taught me how to run a business, hire people, manage clients, do quality work. I fell in love with running my own thing. And painting made me feel really good, especially when I was finished." 
Mr. Barton has reason to feel good now, but he is still not finished. Expedia, which he founded while working as a product manager for the Microsoft Corporation, has grown into one of the largest travel agencies in the country. And last month, Microsoft agreed to sell control of Expedia for an estimated $1.3 billion to USA Networks, the cable television company, which wants Mr. Barton to expand Expedia further, via television.
Expedia, now with headquarters in Bellevue, Wash., has already become what Mr. Barton calls a "travel superstore on the Internet," selling everything from discount air fares and vacation packages to island hideaway rentals. Its work force has swelled to 800 from its original 50. Its offices, once confined to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, now extend to Las Vegas and to outposts in Canada, Britain and Germany.
Unlike many other e-commerce ventures, Expedia makes money. With one-time accounting adjustments excluded, Expedia earned $15 million in the quarter ended June 30, compared with a loss of $13.1 million in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue more than doubled, to $78.5 million.
But Mr. Barton's continued success is not assured. Expedia is in an intense rivalry with Travelocity, a bigger Internet travel agency, which is also profitable, and Orbitz, a new Web site started by the five largest American airlines. Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst at Forrester Research in San Francisco, called Expedia and Travelocity "the Hatfields and the McCoys, with not quite the same level of vitriol. Orbitz throws a wrench into this competition."
Expedia's new relationship with USA Networks has clearly rattled investors in Travelocity. While Expedia's shares closed Friday at $44.60, little changed from the $44.89 closing price when the deal was announced July 16, Travelocity's have fallen 19 percent since then, to $26.30, on fears that Expedia had a powerful new competitive edge. But Michael Stacy, senior vice president for consumer marketing at Travelocity, based in Fort Worth, said of Mr. Barton's group: "We have to stay one step ahead of them and so far we've demonstrated that we have."
Mr. Barton said the USA Networks deal could create opportunities to sell travel that competitors lack. USA Networks' Ticketmaster business, for example, could enable Expedia to sell Las Vegas vacations that include music or sports events. "I like the Dave Matthews band," Mr. Barton said. "Hopefully, there will be Dave Matthews packages available on Expedia with two nights at the Bellagio, airline tickets and tickets to see the concert. That's cool."
Travel industry analysts say Expedia's success so far partly reflects what they called Mr. Barton's correct analysis of the Internet's unique ability to attract travel customers. 
"I think Rich is pretty visionary," said Robert LaFleur, an analyst who follows the online travel industry for Bear Stearns. "He saw the Internet was the perfect medium to sell travel, because buyers and sellers are dispersed, and travel is an information-intense product."
It also helped that the incubator was Microsoft, where Mr. Barton went to work in 1991 a few years after he graduated from Stanford with a degree in industrial engineering.
Mr. Barton came up with the idea when Bill Gates asked him to develop a CD-ROM business involving travel guides. Mr. Barton convinced Mr. Gates that the CD-ROM idea would fail but that an online travel agency might succeed. Expedia began operating in late 1996 and went public three years later at a price of $14 a share. Microsoft then owned 70 percent of Expedia's stock.
USA Networks will use its own stock and other securities to buy up to a 75 percent stake in Expedia. Microsoft is thus obtaining a minority stake in USA Networks; it will still use Expedia to sell travel on the Microsoft Network, its online service.
Mr. Barton's former boss at Microsoft, Brad Chase, attributes his success to qualities he likens to those attained by the scarecrow, lion and tin man in "The Wizard of Oz."
"He's got a brain, he's smart and has good strategic skills," said Mr. Chase, who until April was a senior vice president of Microsoft and is a member of Expedia's board. "He has a lot of courage and is willing to make tough bets. And he's got a heart; he's a warm guy." 
At travel industry conferences, Mr. Barton often shows photographs of himself on vacation with his wife, Sarah, a Seattle obstretrician, and son, William, who coincidentally was born the day of Expedia's initial public offering in 1999.
Mr. Barton also is known for his ability to motivate, epitomized by his willingness to shave off his hair just before embarking on Expedia's road show in advance of the initial public offering. He had promised his staff he would do that if they finished a project on schedule.
"His hair was still spiky when he went out on the road show," said Greg Maffei, a former chief financial officer of Microsoft who is chairman of Expedia's board.
Some acquaintances say Mr. Barton's youth and relative lack of experience are potential liabilities. "He's not seen it all, he doesn't have the bruises, the ups and downs in business the old-timers do," said Gerald Grinstein, a board member of Expedia and Delta Air Lines and the non-executive chairman of Agilent Technologies. "But the fact that he listens very carefully is a strength."
How Mr. Barton fares under the management of USA Networks, of course, remains to be seen. Its chairman and chief executive, Barry Diller, a legend of the broadcast entertainment industry, is 25 years older than Mr. Barton and clearly has his own agenda for Expedia.
"As good as Expedia's services are," Mr. Diller said, "they have a long way to go to serve the customer in every possible configuration."

HEADLINE: Bush administration showing willingness to enforce law on visiting Cuba 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
Few of the tens of thousands of Americans who every year break the law by visiting Cuba ever hear a peep from the federal government, whose prosecution of a Treasury Department prohibition against spending tourist dollars there is scattershot at best.
 But according to administration officials, lawyers and travel agents who arrange trips to Cuba, examples of that ban being enforced have multiplied this year and could become more prevalent in the wake of an announced crackdown by President Bush several weeks ago. 
 "We've observed a marked increase, over the last five to six months, in the number of phone calls and inquiries we get," said Nancy Chang, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights in Manhattan, which does legal advocacy work for Americans facing fines for going to Cuba.
These travelers usually call the center after receiving letters from the Treasury Department threatening them with penalties, typically about $7,500. About a month ago, when the number of cases that the center was working on reached 400, it stopped accepting more. 
Figures from the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the arm of the Treasury Department that enforces the restriction, show that the number of letters sent to Americans it suspects of violating that ban has been rising markedly. In 2000, the last year of the Clinton administration, OFAC sent 188 letters, according to Tasia Scolinos, a spokeswoman for the agency. Between May 4 and July 18 this year, she said, it sent 443 letters.
That still represents a fraction of the Americans who violate the restriction. Although the United States government has no estimates for how many Americans visit Cuba illegally, an analysis of figures from the Cuban government suggests that perhaps 40,000 to 50,000 did so last year.
Cuban soil is not actually off-limits to Americans. But the Treasury Department forbids United States citizens to spend money there without authorization, effectively barring tourist travel. Even prepaid tours booked in another country are illegal without authorization. On paper, although not in practice, a violation can lead to a fine of up to $55,000. Theoretically, violators could also face criminal prosecution and a fine of up to $250,000 and 10 years in prison. 
The Treasury Department permits Americans to spend money in Cuba if they are traveling there for such reasons as academic excursions, cultural exchanges, religious missions, journalistic ventures and visits to relatives. In all but those last two cases, a license authorizing the trip is required. 
And tour operators have become more savvy about -- and more successful at -- sending groups under these auspices. Such travelers can fly directly to Cuba from the United States on charters from New York, Los Angeles and Miami.
But a greater number of tourists go without authorization, traveling through the Bahamas, Canada or Mexico. Cuban authorities do not stamp these travelers' passports, making it difficult for American officials to determine if an American has been to Cuba.
One way that American officials catch offenders is by watching for tourists who arrive in the Bahamas or Canada on flights from Cuba and then proceed directly to a connecting flight to the United States. A Brooklyn woman who was recently threatened with a fine said that she was caught that way. The woman, who insisted on anonymity, said that a United States Customs agent in Montreal had stopped her, said he knew she had been to Cuba and took down her name and address. 
Weeks later, she got a letter from the Office of Foreign Assets Control requesting information about how much money she had spent in Cuba, which is usually the prelude to a fine. The Center for Constitutional Rights is handling her case.
Ms. Chang said that although OFAC typically assesses travelers with a $7,500 fine, it often accepts a payment of between $700 and $2,500. Travelers can try to avoid paying a fine by exercising their right to request a hearing; lawyers and Cuba experts said that the agency, short on personnel, had not actually held such a hearing in 10 years.
But administration officials said that that could change. When President Bush announced his crackdown, which critics attribute to his desire for good political relations with Cuban-American leaders in southern Florida, he said he would devote more resources to enforcement of the ban.
Even so, some lawyers and other experts said that Americans traveling to Cuba without authorization would still probably be playing a game of odds that was decidedly in their favor.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME; 
Owners Get Fee Relief From City

BYLINE:  By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
EARLIER this year, the New York City Department of Finance evoked a collective gasp among rental landlords and co-op boards when officials suddenly ratcheted up efforts to collect unpaid registration fees that owners of rent-stabilized apartments are required to pay the city under a 1984 law -- along with compounded interest on past-due amounts.
 Like an unrelated city decision on tax abatements for co-ops and condominiums, the registration-fee matter was discussed in this column; there have been subsequent developments on both issues. 
 The registration-fee move infuriated many landlords and boards, both because it was the first time officials had made a concerted effort to collect the past-due fees and interest and because it was doing so by adding overdue amounts to property tax bills.
In June, after being prodded by representatives of the landlords and boards the City Council enacted, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani signed, legislation that provided some relief to those who -- in some cases -- could have been liable for thousands of dollars in unpaid fees and interest. 
As reported in this space in April, landlords and co-op boards in thousands of buildings were unpleasantly surprised upon getting tax delinquency notices that consolidated, for the first time, all charges for past-due rent-stabilization registration fees and interest.
And while the owners did not dispute the $10 registration fee, representatives of property owners said that when compounded interest was added to the bills, the amounts due in some buildings amounted to thousands of dollars.
Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a Manhattan organization that represents owners of multifamily buildings, said at the time that some owners were getting bills amounting to four times the original registration fees, while others were being billed for fees that they had already paid.
Co-op boards were particularly concerned because while the unpaid fees were almost always the legal responsibility of the building's sponsor, the inclusion of the past-due amounts on the co-op's tax bill made it appear that the co-op was ultimately responsible.
In fact, co-op lawyers said at the time, lenders who held mortgages on the building and who paid property taxes from escrow accounts could inadvertently pay the amount demanded by the city without first determining who was ultimately responsible for paying it. 
Moreover, they said, the indication of unpaid taxes on the city's records would make it difficult for buyers to get share loans.
Because of the concerns expressed by representatives of property owners and co-op boards and lawyers, however, city officials recently agreed to a compromise on the amount being claimed by the city.
Mr. Strasburg of the Rent Stabilization Association said that on June 18, Mayor Giuliani signed legislation that eliminated interest assessed on unpaid registration fees due for 1984 through 1998. 
"Now, only the actual fees have to be paid," he said. 
In addition, Mr. Strasburg said, the legislation provides that if an owner made the required payments for 1993 through 1998, the city will waive all fees and interest that would otherwise have been due for 1984 through 1992.
Lisa Maluf, chief of staff for the Department of Finance, said that last week the city began sending out amended bills for the unpaid fees through 1998. 
And when the bills for 1999 and 2000 go out later this year, Ms. Maluf said, interest will be calculated only from the date of billing and not retroactively to when the fee was originally due. 
For property owners to be eligible for the concessions offered by the city, she said, all amounts due must be paid within 90 days of billing. Moreover, Ms. Maluf said, co-ops will not be held responsible for charges accrued by sponsors.
Errol A. Brett, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that co-op boards that might have already paid fees or interest for which they are not responsible -- either directly or through payments made from escrow by a lender -- should contact the Department of Finance to ensure that they are properly credited according to the terms of the new legislation. 
The number to call is (718) 935-6723.
Another matter of concern to co-op and condominium owners that has been covered in this space and now needs updating relates to what appears to be a temporary cessation of property tax abatements that apartment owners in the city have enjoyed since 1996.
Stuart A. Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that because tax assessments on co-ops and condominiums were calculated differently than assessments on one- , two- , and three-family homes, apartment owners ended up paying proportionately higher property taxes than homeowners.
As a result, he said, the legislature in 1996 enacted a law that mandated more than $200 million in property tax abatements for co-op and condominium owners in New York City.
The abatements, which increased gradually over three years, ultimately resulted in a 25 percent savings for buildings with average unit assessments of $15,000 or less, and a 17.5 percent savings for buildings with average assessments larger than $15,000. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Saft said, there was nothing in the legislation that guaranteed a continuation of the abatements after the first three years.
And while the legislation directed officials to devise a permanent plan to ensure future tax parity between homes and apartments, that plan, he said, is still on the drawing boards. As a result, he said, co-op boards and condo owners who have become accustomed to finding the abatement reflected on bills mailed out by the city in June will be disappointed this year.
"We're all assuming that the abatements will be reflected on bills that will be sent out later this year," he said.
He explained that although the City Council included the abatements in this year's budget and both houses of the Legislature passed a bill extending the abatement program for three more years, the bill has not yet been signed by Gov. George E. Pataki.
Mollie Fullington, a spokeswoman for Governor Pataki, said that the legislation was under review.

DATELINE: LONG BRANCH 

 BODY:
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN wrote a song about Asbury Park last year called "My City of Ruins" -- and it is not a stretch. The city's beachfront, once blanketed with beach umbrellas and oiled bodies, is nearly deserted, its skyline marred by the corpse of a half-built high rise, the most blatant reminder of a bankruptcy case that has stymied the city's redevelopment for nearly a decade.
 The Beaux Arts Casino Building, designed by the architects of Grand Central Terminal, is vacant and crumbling, its interior gutted for a now-defunct indoor skateboarding park. This resort city, once proud and now eroded by decades of disinvestment and white flight, teeters on the brink of state financial takeover. 
 Just last week hope was reawakened, however, when the new city council struck a deal with an investment company to put up $6.5 million to resuscitate the waterfront. 
It did not have to be such a protracted process.
After all, only five miles away, Long Branch, a city of 32,000, has begun attacking its blight with a $265 million oceanfront redevelopment project designed by the architects of the South Street Seaport in lower Manhattan. Last month, bulldozers flattened a derelict water slide park, a once-thriving attraction that in recent years had become a playground for rats and feral cats.
By next summer, the city will have razed about 60 homes and the few shabby arcades and restaurants that have clung to life on the boardwalk since the amusement pier burned down in 1987. And by 2015, officials say, more than 135 acres of the five-mile beachfront will have been completely rebuilt with a tightly packed grid of homes, stores and parks with a "festive marketplace atmosphere."
The Long Branch project, six years in the making and hailed as a model of good planning, is poised to take advantage of the economic times. It is the product of a stable local government, strong community involvement and close ties between state and local agencies.
But for cities like Asbury Park, the formula remains tantalizingly out of reach.
"When the local leadership is strong and you have a vision in local leadership, that's when good things happen," said Jane M. Kenny, the commissioner of the State Department of Community Affairs, who oversees the state's urban redevelopment initiatives. "When there's instability in town hall, it's very difficult to get off the ground with some of these programs."
In its heyday during the 1860's, Long Branch -- like its neighbor Asbury Park to the south -- was considered among the finest Victorian resorts in the nation. The beachfront was packed with grand hotels like the Continental, at the time the largest summer hotel in the country, with stables and a ballroom that could comfortably hold 1,200.
President Ulysses S. Grant summered in Long Branch, and its grassy bluffs inspired the artist Winslow Homer, whose 1869 oil painting "Long Branch, New Jersey," depicts two Victorian ladies, parasols in hand, peering at a beach packed with bathers and cabanas. 
But both Long Branch and Asbury Park began to lose their appeal at the turn of the century.
"With all these hotels getting older, they were less attractive to the modern crowd," said George H. Moss, Monmouth County's official historian who wrote "Victorian Summers at the Grand Hotels at Long Branch." "People were going to more fashionable places like the Hamptons."
Then came the automobile, air-conditioning, cheaper airplane fares and large shopping malls -- all conspiring to send tourists elsewhere. 
While the cities share a glorious past, there are substantial differences today. Long Branch, a city of 5.1 square miles, has retained a more representative racial mix, with 73.5 percent of the population white, compared with 35 percent in Asbury Park. It also has a slightly higher median household income: $23,736 as against $20,754 in Asbury Park, according to 1990 census data.
Long Branch has also had better luck holding on to its tax base. Only a mile or so from the blighted boardwalk lies the tony Elberon section, indistinguishable from neighboring Deal with its multimillion-dollar seaside mansions. 
To be sure, Asbury Park, with 16,799 residents within its 1.5 square miles, has been cursed with political instability -- to put it gently. In the past 15 years, there have been seven mayors, six city managers, six redevelopment lawyers and an ever-shifting slate of council members. But the chief impediment to the city's rebirth has been a nine-year legal battle with a Connecticut builder, Carabetta Enterprises Inc., who claims sole rights to redevelop a 1.4-mile stretch of oceanfront.
In hindsight, it was not wise to put all of the city's eggs in one basket. In 1986, the city awarded exclusive rights to Carabetta to rebuild the city's neglected beachfront and business district. The $700 million plan called for 2,500 luxury condominiums, renovation of the historic Paramount Theater and Convention Hall at the north end of the boardwalk, and the Casino building at the south end. The centerpiece was to be a luxury high rise with a rooftop swimming pool that was sold out before it was even built. 
"The dream was surfacing," said Deborah M. Collins, a real estate agent who has lived in the city for 15 years and vacationed there as a child. "Everyone was very excited about the condos; my in-laws were going to purchase a retirement condo there. It was very exciting, the thought that my children were going to be exposed to some of my memories through the revitalization of Asbury Park."
But the developer, Joseph H. Carabetta, was caught off guard by the recession in the late 198o's. When his financial backers, the Bank of Boston, pulled back on part of a $40 million loan in 1992, Mr. Carabetta declared bankruptcy, leaving 48 vacant properties, including the unfinished high rise.
As a result, for a decade the oceanfront had been locked in a ghostly state of legal limbo. Mr. Carabetta sued the city in 1993, claiming that officials interfered with his attempts to restart the project. The city counter-sued, claiming that Mr. Carabetta was no longer entitled to the redevelopment rights.
Despite yeares of mediation and dozens of offers from developers willing to buy the rights, the city and Mr. Carabetta failed to settle. All the while, his properties in Asbury Park ran up $12 million back taxes.
That was until last Wednesday, when the council voted to sell Mr. Carabetta's tax liens to a group of investors for $6.5 million. In hasty negotiations that afternoon, Mr. Carabetta also agreed to sell his redevelopment rights to M. D. Sass Municipal Finance Partners III of New York for an undisclosed amount. 
The city had been under a deadline to balance this year's municipal budget, which faced a $4 million deficitr, or be placed under supervision by the Local Finance Board, an arm of the state Division of Local Government Services.
"It is a desperate measure brought on by desperate times," said James G. Aaron, the city's special counsel and current redevelopment lawyer of the tax lien sale. "The council believes and the mayor believes that the city council has been held hostage for an extended period of time and is trying to balance the budget for all of the citizens."
Under the agreement, the city will transfer the redevelopment rights to the company after terms are arrived at on a new plan for the waterfront. 
"That ends all of the litigation, so there is no more litigation, and finally something is going to get done down there because it's a beautiful place," Mr. Carabetta said.
But, he added, 'It's not a done deal yet. It still must be approved by the city, and this is not the first time we went to the city to get an investor approved and they didn't grant the approval."
For now, the newly energized officials -- following the lead of Long Branch -- are seeking to split the project into smaller sections using developers with different specialties. An ideal offer, Mr. Aaron said, would allow the city to revise its 1986 master plan to incorporate a greater mix of residential, commercial and recreational uses.
"I don't have a preference for what goes down there, but I want something to go down there now," said Kevin G. Sanders, the city's new mayor and a sixth-generation resident of Asbury Park. "I want to get out of this gridlock of nothing happening. Something is much better than nothing." 
Mr. Aaron said that if officials had not come to terms with a developer, they would have pursued litigation. He noted that the city had already been considering an offer from the state Department of Community Affairs, which had pledged $6 million over three years as well as legal assistance in fighting Mr. Carabetta's claim in exchange for setting up a state-controlled redevelopment authority. 
The council came close to approving the measure last summer, but the federal bankruptcy court judge overseeing Mr. Carabetta's case, Alan H. W. Shiff, enjoined the city from voting on the measure. 
"It's very frustrating, probably the most frustrating thing I've been involved with," said Charles A. Richman, the assistant commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, "and I've been in government for 30 years." 
Observers said previous city councils deserved much of the blame, insisting that officials could have ended the deadlock years ago had they pursued the lawsuit more aggressively. 
"The problem with Asbury simply is that the city government for 15 years did not have the will to move against Carabetta either to make him perform or to get rid of him," said Joseph Barry, president of the Applied Development Company of Hoboken, whose company -- which specializes in urban renewal projects -- is the designated redeveloper for part of Long Branch. 
Mr. Barry and others blamed political pressure from supporters of Mr. Carabetta, like a former business partner, Henry Vaccaro, who has tinkered around the edges of local politics for years. Others said officials were simply disorganized. 
"They have not had any unity and have bounced back and forth between positions, one meeting taking a position that is completely, 180 degrees opposite to the position they've taken before," said Mr. Aaron. "By contrast," he said, "the new mayor and council, installed July 1, are 150 percent committed to moving in one direction." 
Perhaps surprisingly, Mr. Carabetta agreed. 
"I don't like to get in a finger-pointing contest, but there's a lot of things that happened down there, and some of the people in previous administrations didn't really have the best for the city at heart," he said. "But this council, thank God, is very aggressive and they want something to happen."
Regardless of who is at fault in Asbury Park's sorry tale, Long Branch has learned well from its sister city's woes. Indeed, its master plan calls for five separate redevelopment zones.
To be sure, Long Branch never fell as far and as hard as Asbury Park. Until a fire in 1987, the Kids World Pier drew crowds to its haunted mansion and amusement arcades. Early redevelopment efforts attracted a Hilton hotel to the beachfront, now the Ocean Place Resort and Conference Center. And a federal sand replenishment project, completed in 1998, created wide beautiful beaches.
But in the absence of commerce, the area surrounding the hotel deteriorated quickly. Vacant lots, run-down rental properties and rooming houses became plagued with crime and drugs. 
"If it changed, it only got worse," said the mayor of Long Branch, Adam Schneider, whose administration has shepherded the redevelopment process. 
The challenges attracted the attention of the Thompson Design Group, a Boston firm that designed Baltimore's Harbor Place, the South Street Seaport in Manhattan and Faneuil Hall in Boston. The company said it was was interested in "smart growth," or planning that avoided sprawl by resuscitating blighted urban areas. When a citizens' group called Long Branch Tomorrow asked for the company's help in 1995, it readily agreed.
"Here was a pretty diverse local group with goals that were extremely parallel, but from the bottom up, asking for the kind of growth that the state was trying to convince the citizens to do," said Pratap Talwar, a principal in the Thomas Design Group who is the manager of the Long Branch project. "It was very strange. It was a unique opportunity in a way."
The citizens group, founded by the businessman Robert J. Furlong, who has since died, paid $150,000 for the design work, then stepped to the sidelines as the mayor and council began a series of more than 20 public meetings to develop a master plan. In 1996, the city approved the five-zone concept, then rewrote its land-use regulations for the 135-acre area. 
A year later, the state Department of Environmental Protection agreed to an unprecedented program to give developers fast-track consideration by the state's Coastal Area Facilities Review Board, which examines all coastal development. The process, which has been known to take up to a year, was reduced to no more than 40 days after the local planning board's review. It was an acknowledgement that the city's painstaking design guidelines met the state's own specifications.
"It was a big incentive to developers," Mayor Schneider said. "The tenor of developers took a 180-degree turn."
The city has benefited from its relationship with state agencies, which, both sides agree, has been carefully nurtured. So far, those agencies have pledged more than $13 million in loans and grants for the entire redevelopment project, including $2 million to transform Ocean Boulevard from a seven-lane highway that separates much of the town from the beach to a much more manageable four-lane street. 
"The reason the state was so forthcoming with its resources was because of the good planning process that took place and the fact that city hall was engaged and so was the community," said Ms. Kenny, the commissioner of the state Department of Community Affairs. 
After strong competition among developers, the city last year awarded the first two zones to the Applied Development Company, the builders of Port Liberte in Jersey City and Hoboken's Shipyard development. Builders will break ground on the first phase -- a midrise residential development of about 350 homes -- early next year and complete it in about two years. The second phase, 150 more homes -- ranging from studio apartments to four-bedroom town houses -- should follow 18 months after the first phase begins, said Greg Russo, the company's vice president.
Tucked behind a 2.5-acre oceanfront great lawn, the development will eventually stretch from Seven Presidents Park to the Ocean Place Resort and Conference Center.
As Mayor Schneider put it, the project is designed to change peoples' minds about the area, or "bust the zone."
Next comes the part of the project that officials hope will attract tourists -- a "pier village" to try to bring shops, restaurants, nightclubs and amusements back to the boardwalk. Within about three years, the entire area -- from the hotel to Melrose Terrace -- will be razed and rebuilt, featuring 100,000 square feet of retail space and 420 apartments above.
In addition, city officials want to build a new pier and introduce a ferry service to New York like the one that served the city in the 1800's. But at a cost of about $40 million, officials are not ready to make a final commitment.
The city is currently reviewing proposals for the third development zone, a cluster of six- to seven-story apartment buildings at the southern end of the boardwalk. They hope two other sectors will follow as momentum builds for the redevelopment: one is the expansion of the Ocean Place Resort and Conference Center, and the other is the redevelopment of the gateway to lower Broadway, the city's struggling main drag. Officials plan to add lower Broadway as a sixth redevelopment zone later this month.
Not that everyone here is happy about the changes. About 100 residents will be relocated to make way for the development. It has devastated some old-timers, like the 73-year-old businessman Jimmy Liu, who has been offered $900,000 plus relocation expenses -- which he considers too low -- for his nine boardwalk properties. But the city has been even-handed, giving residents one last summer to enjoy their neighborhood. 
"They've made the decision that it has to go, and I think they've tried to be reasonable about the way they have to go about it," said Mr. Liu's lawyer, Peter H. Wegener. "Nobody's coming in with jack boots or anything."
The signs of gentrification are everywhere, like two new luxury condominium developments at the southern end of the boardwalk and a sparkling new beach club called the Promenade. Home sales are said to be brisk, and new construction can be seen all around the city, including 18 units of low-income housing on Joline Avenue. 
"Property values are going up a lot," Mayor Schneider said. "I think a lot of people are anticipating what is going to happen. You didn't necessarily think you would hear that about Long Branch."
But amid the euphoria, some observers fear that the development will not be as bright as its architectural renderings suggest. 
"It's got potential to be great," said Dan Jacobsen a former state assemblyman and the outspoken publisher of the Tri-City News, an alternative weekly newspaper that covers Asbury Park, Red Bank and Long Branch. "Also, it's got the potential to be condoland on the sea, like overdeveloped sections of Florida."
Perhaps as Asbury Park's renewal gets under way, the city -- ike Long Branch before it -- will also learn from earlier mistakes.
In the past three years, the downtown business district has been quietly transformed from a ghost town to a trendy multicultural arts community with galleries, antique stores, and even a coffee shop. It is a community-based process that might not have been possible amid the speculative rush of a huge redevelopment project. 
"We're seeing rising property values and investors fixing up buildings despite the stalled waterfront and despite unstable city councils," Mr. Jacobson said.
As Mayor Sanders put it: "Asbury has been as low as we can possibly go. We are on the rise."
Even Mr. Springsteen's song proclaims: "My city of ruins. Come on rise up!"

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Walking The Trade Tightrope, Confidently

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
ROBERT B. ZOELLICK, the United States trade representative, is an optimistic guy. He needs to be, given the difficulties he faces in pushing the free-trade agenda of the Bush administration.
 At home, he has trouble in Congress, where the already tenuous support for trade initiatives has been weakened further by the slowing economy. 
 Abroad, he is struggling to stitch together support for a new round of worldwide trade-liberalization talks this fall, and to build some momentum for a trade pact encompassing North and South America. 
Everywhere he turns, he is faced with questions about whether the global economy has become the enemy of ordinary workers. And even governments inclined to support trade agreements as a powerful source of economic growth have had second thoughts since the collapse of the last effort to push ahead -- in Seattle in 1999. The violence last month at the Group of 8 summit in Genoa, Italy, has only underscored their concern.
"There's an odd balance," Mr. Zoellick said. "There's this tremendous opportunity for political and economic influence through trade. And there's an atmosphere after Seattle of wondering if globalization is a force that is in some way threatened by retrograde movements."
Mr. Zoellick's most immediate challenge is to win authority from Congress to negotiate trade deals that could not be picked apart through amendments. Without such negotiating power -- long known as fast-track but now renamed trade promotion authority -- it could be hard to persuade trading partners to come to the table prepared for serious give-and-take on tariff reduction and market-opening agreements.
President Bill Clinton could not persuade Congress to give him the authority in his second term, and his trade agenda languished. Congressional Democrats want provisions covering labor and environmental standards in trade deals, a stance opposed by most Republicans, who want the issues dealt with separately. 
Last week, Mr. Zoellick had some cause for hope. The House passed a bill that would slash tariffs on trade with Jordan; the legislation included provisions to discourage Jordan from loosening its labor and environmental laws in search of a cost advantage in exporting to the United States.
Republicans in the House, where trade bills face their toughest test, have been offering some concessions in the hope of attracting enough Democrats to pass trade promotion authority. But on the day that the Jordan bill passed, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, postponed consideration of the measure until September.
Then, on Wednesday, the administration suffered a setback in trade with Mexico. Prodded by organized labor, the Senate voted to impose a variety of safety and insurance restrictions on Mexican trucking companies operating in the United States.
Mr. Zoellick wants to have negotiating authority in his pocket by November, when the 141 members of the World Trade Organization gather in Qatar to try to start a new round of global trade talks. Even trade proponents acknowledge that failure to get talks off the ground this time could mean a long period of stagnation at best and backsliding into protectionism at worst.
BUT it has been difficult for the United States to agree with its trading partners on what trade issues should be on the table, much less to resolve their differences. 
Mr. Zoellick has been pressing for a focus on agriculture and service industries. Europe, with its tradition of heavily subsidizing farmers, is reluctant to concentrate too much on agriculture and wants to include topics like environmental protection and antitrust policy. Developing nations are concerned about being forced to make good on previous market-opening commitments that they have not carried out. 
The job will not get easier if the United States and the rest of the world continue to suffer from weakening economic growth. Exposing local employers to more global competition at a time when they are shedding jobs -- even with the promise of new export opportunities -- is a tough vote for any elected official in any country. 
The good news, from Mr. Zoellick's perspective, is that trade is at least back on the front burner, providing him an opportunity to make the case for the economic and political benefits that he says open markets can bring. "Both on the global side, because of the dispirited atmosphere after Seattle and the economic slowdown, and on the domestic side, the agenda was in some danger," Mr. Zoellick said. "Now at least the game is joined again."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Why Traders Keep Playing With Trucks And Trains

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
HIGH energy prices and a soft economy have clobbered commercial airline stocks. But the rest of the transportation patch is doing just fine. 
 The Bloomberg U.S. Trucking index and the Standard & Poor's Railroad index bottomed within a week of each other in March 2000. Since then, the trucking index is up 37 percent. And the S.& P. rail index has risen a tidy 53 percent. 
 Warren E. Buffett, no slave to fashion, decided last week that he wanted a piece of the action and bought the Xtra Corporation, a container leasing company, for $590 million. 
Gary Yablon, a managing director and transportation analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, took time last week to talk about transportation. Following are excerpts from the conversation: 

Q. Why hasn't the run-up in energy prices hammered these companies?

A. Energy represents somewhere between 5 percent and 13 percent of each revenue dollar, with trucking companies at the upper end and railroads and air cargo companies at the lower end.
That has hurt the income statements. But the ability of companies to pass through those increases to customers is important. All of them have been able to do that, but the railroads have done less well than the others. That ability is important, because to the extent I can create a surcharge that is a pass-through. 
That said, the railroad industry is starting to see better pricing, is raising rates and is seeing them hold. That hasn't happened in many years.

Q. Why are the railroads able to raise rates now? Is consolidation part of the answer?

A. It is hard to parse out the whys and
wherefores. But consolidation is probably playing a part. The industry had seven major players in 1995. Now we have four. That is a lot of consolidation.
But service has improved a lot over the last 18 months. Transit times in the Eastern United States have improved by 25 percent to 35 percent during that period. And the on-time index has increased about 30 percent over the last year. Those sorts of figures give companies more leverage with their customers when talking about a rate increase.

Q. Warren Buffett buys companies that do things he understands. And he isn't known for overpaying. What does he see in Xtra?

A. Broadly speaking, Xtra is a transportation leasing company. It leases drive van trailers, trailers that can be put on a railroad flatcar and domestic marine containers. They are a large player in all of their markets.
There are not many transportation companies that are comparable. Xtra has strong and predictable cash flows and discretionary capital expenditures. 
If Xtra decides to slow their growth dramatically in a given year, they don't buy new equipment. I don't have that luxury if I am a railroad company, because I have a fair amount of capital expenditure to maintain physical plant. One could make the same statement for the air freight and trucking sectors. 

Q. As groups, these stocks have done very well over the last 14 months. Are they about to run out of gas?

A. The Street has treated the stocks very well, but I don't think their day is done.
You have to get a bit more selective as stocks and groups move up, but we continue to be positive on both trucking and railroad stocks, and there are some thematic things going on that we like beyond ways to play the economy. I already mentioned the firmer pricing for railroads. 
In trucking, which pulls 80 percent of the freight in the United States, the last couple of years have been very hard times. A bad economy, high fuel prices, rising insurance costs and a very weak market for used trucks have hurt. 
Now, many people are leaving the business. That is reducing the number of companies out there and is driving the stocks of the publicly traded companies. There are fewer players in the market and the stronger survivors are getting stronger. 

Q. At what sorts of price-to-earnings multiples are these stocks trading?

A. The air freight companies are tracking almost in line with the market multiple. The railroads are trading at a 30 percent discount and the trucks at a discount of about 15 percent to 20 percent.

Q. Which stocks do you like?

A. We like five railroad companies: CSX, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific, Canadian Pacific and Canadian National.
Among trucking companies, we like Swift Transportation, Knight Transportation, USFreightways and CNF. 
We have a buy rating on United Parcel Service as a terrific long-term play. And in the logistics area we like C. H. Robinson Worldwide, Expeditors International of Washington and Landstar System.

HEADLINE: Reform and an Evolving Electorate 

BYLINE:  By Alex Keyssar; Alex Keyssar, professor of history and social policy at Harvard's Kennedy School, is author of "The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States."

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C. 

 BODY:
The report of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform, issued last week, has the unmistakable earmarks of political compromise. Led by former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford and populated by notables from both major parties (with a few eminent civilians thrown in), the commission endorsed an array of election reforms that will not rock many boats. The commission remained squarely within a long tradition of minimal federal involvement in the conduct of American elections.
 Indeed, there is a certain innocence about the report -- an innocence of history and of the hard-knuckled realities of American politics. The text and recommendations read as though the problems with Election 2000 were inadvertent and accidental: somehow, a nation fully committed to democratic processes let things slip, and we ended up with hanging chads, antiquated machinery, an enraged black community and a surfeit of lawyers. 
 But our history suggests otherwise: the very unpretty election of last November emerged from deep currents in American political life. Although we don't like to acknowledge it, there have always been strong antidemocratic forces in the United States. Large numbers of Americans, throughout our history, have not believed in universal suffrage and have acted accordingly. Their presence delayed the achievement of a fully enfranchised population until roughly 1970 and produced many episodes in which the right to vote contracted.
The most extreme and well-known examples involve African-Americans in the South who were deprived of their constitutionally protected right to vote for more than 70 years. But antidemocratic Southerners have had plenty of company, and not just in the early days of the republic when voting was limited to men of property. National women's suffrage was not finally adopted until 1920. Rhode Island imposed a property qualification on all foreign-born citizens for much of the 19th century; California went to great lengths to prevent Asians from voting; New York adopted an English language literacy test in 1921 that was still disfranchising hundreds of thousands of people in the 1960's. In the 1930's, an organization headed by George Wickersham, a former United States attorney general, actively sought to disfranchise unemployed workers who were receiving federal relief.
The resistance to democracy affected voting procedures as well as the right to vote itself; indeed, the erection of procedural obstacles to voting was often a strategic response to the formal enfranchisement of people considered undesirable. The registration systems that emerged in the late 19th century, for example, were not simply good government reforms designed to eliminate corruption (which is how the Carter-Ford commission describes them); they were also efforts to keep immigrants and the poor from voting by interposing layers of paperwork and deadlines between potential voters and the ballot box.
The decline in turnout in American elections, which began at the end of the 19th century, was not an accident or the symptom of a mysterious malady. Both in the North and in the South, turnout was reduced, in good part, by laws designed to keep citizens from the polls and to prevent popular dissident parties from effectively contesting elections. Alabama's disfranchisement of men convicted of crimes like vagrancy and adultery -- even after time had been served -- was expressly crafted at the turn of the century to limit black participation in politics. (Similar laws limit black Alabaman voting today. Such permanent disfranchisement would be eliminated by the Carter-Ford recommendations.) In 1907, Pittsburgh's newly created voter registration board crowed about the "good results obtained" under a recently passed Pennsylvania registration law: in two years, the number of registrants was nearly halved.
The two major political parties have been key actors in this long-running drama, and neither has an umblemished record of embracing democratic principles. While Republicans courageously (and self-interestedly) pressed for the enfranchisement of African-Americans after the Civil War, they made it difficult for immigrant workers to vote in Northern cities. The Democrats took the opposite position, fighting to include immigrants while staunchly defending racial barriers in the South. Republican state parties often instituted complex registration and procedural rules to limit the number of votes cast by supporters of urban Democratic machines; frequently the machines, dominated by Irish politicians, learned to live with the rules and then used them to restrict the participation of other immigrant groups.
This should not surprise us. The two major parties are in the business of winning elections rather than promoting democracy, and elections can be won by disfranchising opponents, making it procedurally difficult for them to vote or not counting their votes at all. As political professionals learned long ago, an electorate that is predictable in size and composition is generally far preferable to large turnouts and mass participation.
There is an innocence, too, in the Carter-Ford commission's reluctance to recommend greater national authority over the conduct of elections. The issue, to be sure, is a delicate one. But democracy is a national value, and there is nothing inappropriate about the national government's enforcing its fulfillment. Throughout our history, the claim that voting was a state matter, rather than a federal one, has invariably been deployed by those who wanted to restrict any expansion of the franchise. "States' rights" was the cry of opponents of the 15th Amendment, the 19th Amendment and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Indeed, the revolution in voting rights of the 1960's -- and it was nothing less than that -- came from Congress and the federal courts precisely because both believed that the national government ought to be the guarantor of democracy and that states with undemocratic political institutions could not be trusted to democratize themselves.
If the recommendations of the national commission are implemented, and many of them probably will be, the chances of having a replay of last year's electoral crisis will be greatly diminished. But political crises rarely repeat themselves according to the same script, and the prescriptions offered will do little to address the more subterranean faults in our political life that became visible during and after Election 2000: the alienation and anger of much of the black community; the pitfalls of the Electoral College and the ways in which it skews political campaigns; the high rates of nonvoting, particularly among the poor and less educated; the dangers of partisan control of election administration; the cavalier and disrespectful treatment of voters in many locales; and the absence, as the Supreme Court observed in Bush v. Gore, of a constitutional right to vote for president. If our electoral system is to become, as the commission hopes, "a source of national pride and a model to all the world," a great deal of work remains to be done.

HEADLINE: The World: Play the Japan Card?; 
Facing Down China Without Riling It Up

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia 

 BODY:
IN their first few months in office, President Bush and his foreign policy advisers proclaimed a harsher line toward China than their immediate predecessors. On his trip to Asia last month, however, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell sounded far more conciliatory, and the Chinese seemed to echo the tone.
 The new calm seems to reflect a realization by the Bush team that steady confrontation is no way to deal with China, and that on some level the two countries simply have to deal normally with each other. 
 But that may only mask the potential for new tensions ahead. For underneath the calmer talk, it became clear on Mr. Powell's trip, the Bush administration still plans to emphasize America's military arrangements in the region in ways that the Chinese seem likely to find provocative -- including encouraging Japan to rethink the ways it can use its long harnessed military. 
At bottom, the problem before the Bush team is a familiar one. For America, China is a potentially valuable trade partner and a potentially dangerous adversary, and nobody really knows which potential will be realized. For decades, every American administration has assumed that it must be ready for anything, but also that China should not be pushed toward antagonism.
So the question for the administration, so evident on this recent trip, is this: In re-emphasizing the military side of its policies, will it unwittingly derail accommodation?
During his Asia tour, which included a stop of less than 24 hours in China, Secretary Powell played both sides of the equation. His words were conciliatory, but he also heard and saw trends that made the region appear more unstable than at any time since the 1970's -- an atmosphere unlikely to dissuade him from trying to strengthen America's presence in Asia.
In most countries -- including China, where a succession looms next year -- political leadership is in flux. In Indonesia, one president was pushed out and another was sworn in during a transition that remains an unfinished story. In South Korea, Mr. Powell met with a lame-duck president, Kim Dae Jung, while North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, trekked off by train to Moscow, ignoring an invitation by Washington for talks. And while the Japanese had just elected a popular new prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, their country's economy remained tormented by a decade of stagnation. 
In sum, according to an assessment presented to the conference of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that Mr. Powell attended in Hanoi, the rest of the world sees the region as one whose economy has weakened, leaving its politics unstable, and the area "in disarray." Moreover, according to a United Nations world investment report, these days China is sucking up the vast bulk of direct foreign investment in Asia, leaving only scraps for others.
The administration is using the trends to explain its eagerness to bolster American support for the Asia-Pacific region, which is nervous about Beijing's intentions but fearful of antagonizing China.
"The Bush people," said Robert Suettinger, an analyst at the RAND Corporation who was an Asia expert at the National Security Council during the Clinton administration, "are casting about to find what kind of reassurances they can give to the region, which is jittery about China, but at the same not be unduly provocative of a very touchy China." The question, of course, is how this affects relations with China.
For the moment, the Chinese leadership seems to be in one of its more relaxed moods. Recent public opinion polls on Taiwan reflect a relatively sanguine view of the mainland, and Taiwanese investment in China continues to grow. The Chinese are quite happy that the conventional submarines that Washington promised to sell Taiwan this spring will take much longer to deliver than expected. And according to an account given by an official traveling with Mr. Powell, the Chinese premier, Zhu Rongji, seemed unruffled by the Bush administration's policies. After asking the secretary the meaning of the phrase "strategic competitor," he accepted a bland answer without protest, the official said.
How long bland answers will get such bland replies is another question, though, because the Bush administration has made it clear that it will not back away from its plans to shift its strategic focus from Europe to the Pacific, a strategy in which China is seen as a potential enemy.
SECRETARY POWELL certainly indicated that the administration was sticking by its goals of reviving military alliances in Asia. This does not mean reinventing the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, a cold war alliance that disbanded in 1977. Few Asian countries want to be put in such an anti-China posture.
But it does mean encouraging the Japanese -- who still harbor critical American military bases, especially on Okinawa -- to reinterpret the "peace constitution" that was imposed on them after World War II (but is now highly valued) so that their Self-Defense Force can be used, at the very least, for peacekeeping missions. In this, the White House appears to have a willing partner in Mr. Koizumi. But even a modestly remilitarized Japan "is certain to arouse concern and opposition in Beijing," a former American ambassador to China, J. Stapleton Roy, said in a speech recently.
Sensitivities are so strong that there was some skepticism among Australian defense experts when Secretary Powell said that Washington wanted to promote stronger coordination of the defense strategies of Japan, South Korea, Australia and the United States. A former senior official in the Australian Defense Department, Paul Dibb, cautioned that such an arrangement should stop short of a formal alliance that China could interpret as a hostile effort to contain it. Joint planning for military contingencies, he said, should be ruled out.
In another move that China might interpret as part of an encirclement strategy, the administration last week began to re-establish ties with the Indonesian Army, on which President Megawati Sukarnoputri is expected to rely as a national unifier.
Mr. Suettinger summed up the tricky balance required in the American-Chinese relationship this way: "This is a huge thing that has to be managed. We don't know where China is going; China doesn't know where China is going. We have to be prepared for a variety of contingencies. If containment is necessary, we want to be prepared for it with the minimum of fuss."

Feeling OPEC's Pain

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
George W. Bush said something interesting about economics the other day. No, really. It wasn't his usual line about how tax cuts are the answer to whatever ails you; he said something unscripted, something that reflected what he really thinks and feels. You might say that his remarks gave us a sense of his soul. And it turns out that his soul -- or maybe it's just his heart -- belongs to people, of whatever nationality, who sell oil. 
 Recently Mr. Bush was asked about the decision of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce output by a million barrels a day. That's about as much as the Department of Energy's estimate of peak daily production if we drill in the Alaskan tundra -- a peak that won't come until the middle of the next decade. And OPEC cut production in order to keep oil prices high despite slumping world demand, which would seem to be against U.S. interests. 
 Yet Mr. Bush was remarkably sympathetic to OPEC's cause; it seems that he feels the oil exporters' pain. "It's very important for there to be stability in a marketplace. I've read some comments from the OPEC ministers who said this was just a matter to make sure the market remains stable and predictable," he declared. Just in case you wonder whether this was really an endorsement of price-fixing, or whether Mr. Bush was just being polite, his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, left no doubt: "The president thinks it's important to have stability, and stability can come in the form of low prices, stability can come in the form of moderate prices."
This is the same man who boasted during last year's campaign that he would force OPEC to "open the spigot." Did OPEC take Mr. Bush's remarks as a green light for further cuts? According to one oil analyst interviewed by Reuters, Mr. Bush's apparent expression of support for their efforts to keep prices high "excited a lot of OPEC ministers."
Funny, isn't it? When California complains about high electricity prices, it gets a lecture about how you can't defy the laws of supply and demand. But when foreign producers collude to prevent prices from falling in the face of an oil glut, the administration not only signals its approval but endorses the old, discredited theory that cartels are in consumers' interest.
This was not the only case in which the administration dropped its principles when the subject turned to oil. The energy bill the House passed last week was notable for its indifference to environmental consequences and its lack of serious conservation measures -- increased fuel-efficiency standards could easily save far more oil than we'll ever get by punching holes in the tundra. But the most amazing thing is that the bill contains more than $30 billion in subsidies and special tax breaks for energy producers. That's even more amazing given that money is looking very tight: Republicans are nervously awaiting new budget projections, which everyone in Washington expects will show that the tax cut has wiped out the non-trust-fund budget surplus for the foreseeable future. 
So it seems that many of the administration's principles contain a special clause, making an exception when it comes to oil. The administration tells people that they should place their trust in the free market, and accept the fact that prices will move up and down with changes in supply and demand -- unless those people happen to be selling oil. The administration tells people that they should be self-reliant, and should not expect subsidies from the federal government -- unless those people happen to be selling oil. And the administration tells countries that they must expect the United States to stand up for its own interests, and that our government doesn't worry about offending their delicate sensibilities -- unless those countries happen to be selling oil. 
Mr. Bush was, needless to say, naive in ascribing any altruistic motives to the OPEC ministers. They don't want stability, they want money -- your money. And their action didn't do the world economy a favor -- on the contrary, falling oil prices were one of the things that economists had hoped might reduce the risk of a global recession. So OPEC's decision to cut output, which Mr. Bush seems to condone, was bad for the world, and bad for the people of the United States -- except, of course, for those people who happen to be selling oil.

HEADLINE: North Korean, With Putin, Vows to Curb Missile Program 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 4 

 BODY:
The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, today repeated a promise to suspend ballistic missile launchings until 2003, saying in a declaration with President Vladimir V. Putin here that his nation's missile program "does not present a threat to nations respecting North Korea's sovereignty."
 The declaration, aimed squarely at the United States' proposal to build a defense against ballistic missile attacks by so-called rogue states, came at a Kremlin meeting of the two leaders that capped Mr. Kim's 10-day journey to Moscow by rail. 
 The United States has repeatedly cited a threat from North Korea as part of its rationale for wanting to build a shield, which Russia opposes for fear it would challenge its own arsenal and scuttle an important arms control agreement with the United States. 
The statement today was the major development of the secretive and at times strange visit here by the Stalinist leader, which one television commentator said "created the feeling of a time capsule" in Red Square. 
Mr. Putin and Mr. Kim spent much of the day in negotiations, privately and with advisers, that centered largely on economic issues. The joint declaration, issued at midday, was a striking exception in which Mr. Putin appeared to give moral support -- and perhaps reassurance -- to a nation making one of its first tentative efforts to enter the world at large. 
North Korea first pledged to suspend missile launches in 1999, during an effort by President Clinton's White House to curb missile and nuclear programs that had threatened to escalate into a military crisis on the Korean Peninsula.
The statement today was the second iteration of that guarantee and the first such overture to President Bush, who only recently renewed efforts to cultivate North Korea after a review of American policy.
It also was a victory for Mr. Putin, who not only wants to curb the programs for Russia's strategic reasons but also wants to position himself as an intermediary for North Korea's dealings with the West. 
The declaration committed North Korea and Russia to the boilerplate language of Russian foreign policy, the "formation of a new fair world order" framed by international law and beyond the domination of any single power. But it also pointedly committed them to combat international terrorism, underscoring North Korea's insistence that it is not the unpredictable rogue nation that the United States describes.
And it repeated that the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty should remain the foundation of arms control efforts. The United States says the treaty, which prohibits missile defenses like the one Washington proposes, is outmoded and must be scrapped.
In the document, the Kremlin also expressed "understanding" -- though not agreement -- for North Korea's demand that the United States remove its forces from South Korea, a move it says would speed reunification talks on the peninsula.
Mr. Kim's two-day visit to Moscow began on the same flat note of constricting security that has marked his entire journey on the Trans-Siberian Railroad since July 26. Foreign news media have been barred from covering the Moscow talks, and the Kremlin said North Korea had rejected the news conference that often accompanies such events.
The arrival of Mr. Kim's 21-car armored train shut down one of Moscow's busiest train stations, whose walls had been retouched with paint, its rafters embellished with new flags and its Lenin statue stripped of bird droppings for the occasion. Mr. Kim spent the night in the Kremlin guest house used by his father, Kim Il Sung, when he visited the Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev in 1984.
This morning, swaddled in a motorcade of nearly 20 cars and watched over by sharpshooters in Kremlin towers, he roared out of the Kremlin gate and onto Red Square. There, clad in a gray military-style tunic and dark glasses, he accompanied goose-stepping guards in laying wreaths at Lenin's mausoleum and the tomb of the unknown soldier.
For the event, the Kremlin restored an honor guard that had been removed from Lenin's Tomb after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.The entire affair was filmed by North Korean crews using ancient 35 millimeter film cameras -- an eerie scene which, to older Russians, recalled the glory days of Soviet rule.
"It has to be mentioned that it all looked very natural at this place, Red Square," a reporter for the NTV television network said during its coverage of the event. "There was an expression some time ago -- 'some chilliness goes down behind the collar.' This is kind of what I felt.' "
Back inside the Kremlin, a one-on-one meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Kim ran 40 minutes past its scheduled end. But, aside from their joint declaration, there was no indication of what the two men discussed.
North Korea has said virtually nothing about Mr. Kim's visit first official trip to a non-Communist nation, a journey watched by Westerners for markers of North Korea's slow engagement with the outside world. 
Still, what North Korea wants from the Kremlin is not hard to divine. Increased trade, military hardware and moral support in its tortuous dealings with the United States and South Korea are atop the list.
Trade between the two nations is minuscule -- only about $105 million last year, and rising about 5 percent annually -- and since North Korea has virtually nothing to sell, its exports consist mostly of labor.
North Korea's creaking military machine consists mostly of outdated Russian- and Chinese-made tanks and Chinese knockoffs of older models of Russia's MIG fighter jets. A Russian arms expert quoted by the news service Interfax called the North Korean Navy motley.
The Kremlin has not ruled out the possibility of selling arms to North Korea. But any sales are likely to be small, given North Korea's estimated military budget of barely $100 million a year.
But in more than a few ways it was Russia, a country on the uptick following a decade of chaos, that stood to reap the most benefit from one of the oddest and most secretive state visits in recent history. By acting as Mr. Kim's intermediary with the outside world, Mr. Putin not only burnishes Russia's diplomatic status but also gives it a chip to play in relations with the United States.
More than that, North Korea stands solidly between Russia and a pre-eminent goal in Asia: an economic link to South Korea and by extension to the rest of the Pacific.
Russia has cultivated ties to South Korea since the early days of Boris N. Yeltsin's presidency. Mr. Putin has grand plans for the relationship, including a pipeline that would deliver Russian natural gas to South Korean homes and factories, and an extension of the Trans-Siberian Railroad to South Korea's booming ports.
The Kremlin is promoting the Trans-Siberian as a freight highway from Asia to Europe that could cut the shipping costs of manufacturers and customers on both ends by as much as half. 
"South Korea is the more important partner of Russia, by force of at least economic considerations, than is North Korea," Sergei Karaganov, deputy director of the Council of Europe, said this week on the Moscow news radio station Echo Moskvy. "We're interested in military and technical cooperation with South Korea, first of all because they have money. Keeping in mind that there will be a process of reunification in the future, we should try to reap the maximum benefits."
Mr. Kim's marathon rail trip is not over. After a private concert and a visit to Russian space facilities outside Moscow on Sunday, he will head north by rail to St. Petersburg -- and then, after a stop there, retrace his 6,000-mile-plus steps back home.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 7, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the Kremlin meeting of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, and the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, misidentified the Russian president with whom Mr. Kim's father met similarly in 1984. It was Konstantin U. Chernenko; Leonid I. Brezhnev died in 1982.

HEADLINE: AFTER SIX MONTHS, BUSH TEAM PLANS CHANGE OF FOCUS 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4 

 BODY:
Midway through his first year, President Bush is planning a significant change in focus that includes renewed attention to issues like education and immigration and a vigorous discussion of values.
 According to interviews with many administration officials, Mr. Bush wants to move beyond the conventional Republican agenda of tax cuts and energy production that mainly defined the beginning of his presidency and tackle issues and themes that strike Americans in a more emotional, personal way. 
 He hopes to put an extra emphasis on what he has called the "compassionate" nature of his conservatism with events and remarks this month, during a summer vacation in Texas, and with the initiatives he pursues when he returns to the White House after Labor Day. His aides, and Republican lawmakers who are up for re-election in 2002, hope that in the process Mr. Bush will improve his and his party's standing with moderates, independents and women. 
The president's effort will also include a shift in the staging of his events, as aides look for ways to shove aside lecterns and put Mr. Bush in less formal settings, with small groups of voters. Administration officials and their allies have long bemoaned Mr. Bush's stiffness and, in some cases, clumsiness in front of a microphone, and they have worried that his public appearances do not demonstrate the warmth that they see in him, or his firm grasp of policy.
"We want to let the country get a glimpse of the real George W. Bush," said Nicholas E. Calio, the administration's chief liaison to Congress, adding that the administration also wanted Americans to "see the ease with which he understands and talks about issues."
"We've got to find a way to bring those elements out," Mr. Calio said.
As Mr. Bush pivots from his first six months in office to the rest of a year fraught with political dangers, the important adjustments that he and his aides are deliberating and making partly reflect his movement from old to new items on his legislative and political check list.
But these changes also underscore a recognition by administration officials that while the president is leaving for his summer break today with a seemingly solid job approval rating and several important legislative victories under his belt, he could be doing much better and has numerous political vulnerabilities.
In particular, Mr. Bush continues to battle many Americans' perceptions of him as someone who does not necessarily understand their problems or worry as much about them as he does about business. Polls suggest that most voters like and respect him, but that many find him, in a sense, ideologically aloof.
"That's one of the big frustrations," a Republican strategist with close ties to the administration said. The strategist then recalled the way Mr. Bush sought to sell himself during the presidential campaign.
"Remember the term 'different kind of Republican'?" the strategist said. "They want to get back to that. So far, in fact and in perception, be it the tax cut or the pro-business regulatory moves, Bush is a fairly orthodox Republican."
So he will do less orthodox things over the coming months, his aides and allies say. He will push for a prescription drug benefit for elderly Americans and for a more accommodating approach to illegal immigrants, something he has already begun advocating.
He will talk more about values and possibly promote government initiatives to help parents protect their children from certain cultural influences and to reduce teen pregnancy through abstinence-based programs. He will exhort Americans to pitch in and help those who need it, instead of relying on the government to do so.
And while some of this is traditional music to socially conservative ears, the administration is looking for a broader audience and trying to accomplish more than solidifying its support on the right.
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, said Mr. Bush had his work cut out for him in convincing Americans that he was a champion of their basic concerns, because many voters see his tax cut as a gift to the rich and believe he is sheltering corporations from environmental responsibility.
"He is perceived to be too much on the side of wealthy, big-business, monied interests, and it's really starting to permeate broad assumptions about him," Ms. Lake said. "This fall will be very telling."
One senior administration official said having Mr. Bush address issues like teen pregnancy and adoption would give voters "a glimpse of George Bush the man and the things he cares about" and would focus on "the commonality that he has with the others in the country."
Another official said this values-based discussion, occurring under the rubric "Communities of Character," was a way to "put some emphasis on his commitment to compassionate, activist government."
Mr. Bush will essentially begin doing that this month, with sporadic events during trips from his ranch in Crawford, Tex. His aides have given the month a theme, "Home to the Heartland," and Mr. Bush on Friday offered a preview of how he will seek to position himself.
"We must help disadvantaged Americans find opportunity," he said, foreshadowing what he planned to discuss over coming months. "We must show that our welcoming society values the ideals and contributions of immigrants. We must challenge Americans to be citizens, not spectators, in the renewal of their neighborhoods and their cities."
Mr. Bush and his aides are also bracing for what they acknowledge will be one of the biggest -- and perhaps most defining -- decisions of his presidency, whether to permit federal financing for research on embryonic stem cells and under what conditions. He said today that he intends to make his decision before Congress returns in September.
In the process, he could reassure or alienate conservatives, and he could strengthen or surrender a claim to the center. Republicans who think Mr. Bush has tilted too far to the right see the stem cell decision as a critical opportunity for him to find a different political equilibrium.
Kenneth M. Duberstein, a former chief of staff for President Ronald Reagan, envisioned a way in which the coming weeks and months could, in his view, work powerfully to Mr. Bush's benefit.
"If you have him in the Rose Garden surrounded by Republican and Democratic legislators signing a patients' bill of rights, and then he makes what I would term the right decision on stem cell -- i.e., federal funding for it -- then he has put real meat on the bones of compassionate conservatism," Mr. Duberstein said.
Administration officials say moral principle, not political calculus, will guide Mr. Bush's stem cell decision. But whatever he decides, these officials concede that his fluency in talking about it, and persuading Americans that he put intense thought into it, is crucial. The administration has been exhaustively deliberating how to handle the announcement.
Aides have weighed possibilities as disparate as a televised address from the Oval Office and the release of a written document stating Mr. Bush's position. The likeliest scenario, several administration allies say, is some kind of news conference.
"I believe that the explanation is probably just as important as the decision," said Andrew H. Card Jr., Mr. Bush's chief of staff, adding that this was much "bigger than traditional policy decisions."
The administration's determination to present Mr. Bush as thoughtful and ruminative dovetails with its desire to focus on issues that are not simply about dollars and cents.
In both cases, Mr. Bush and his aides would like voters to see him as more than a tax-cutting conservative. A more rounded portrait could help the administration -- and the party -- during the inevitable battles over appropriations bills this fall, when Democratic leaders will say the tax cut Mr. Bush signed is starving vital spending.
Their hand could be strengthened considerably by the new surplus estimates the Congressional Budget Office will probably release later this month. Economists and lawmakers expect those estimates to be smaller than previous ones, buttressing many Democrats' claims that the tax cut was not affordable.
That will also complicate another of Mr. Bush's goals: military reforms, including national missile defense.
"Because of the budget implications, they have to get that done sooner rather than later," said Charlie Black, a Republican strategist who has advised the administration. "That's going to be a big sales job."
In addition, Mr. Bush's record on foreign policy will come under fresh review when he takes the most ambitious of his overseas trips as president, traveling to China in October.
Political analysts said that his break with allies on a global warming treaty, other decisions related to the environment and his focus on the tax cut last winter combined to emphasize Mr. Bush's conservatism.
"He needs to do more for the center," said Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican.
Mr. Specter said that Mr. Bush was being personally attentive to moderates like him, but that the president "has to do more on the issues." Mr. Specter added that stem cell research, which he favors, would be a perfect place to start.
Mr. Bush's aides feel that inadequate attention has been paid to what they see as his centrist credentials and accomplishments on education. Mr. Bush dropped vouchers from education bills that, in different forms, were passed by the House and Senate, and he and his aides are intent on seeing those bills successfully reconciled and sent to his desk.
"We've got to get that education package through the conference committee," Mr. Card said, later adding, "He's going to keep talking about education, even after he signs education into law."
"He's also going to do an awful lot on the environment," Mr. Card said, although he did not specify what that would be.
What was clear was that, bit by bit, the administration would try to address Mr. Bush's vulnerabilities and cast him as someone who cares deeply and can talk articulately about Americans' noneconomic concerns. The administration is hatching ideas for addressing those issues.
"They want him to connect more with average citizens," said the strategist who worried that Mr. Bush had not established himself as a "different kind of Republican."
"If you're stuck in box of Republican orthodoxy," the strategist said, "and you came on the scene as a different kind of Republican, you better get flat to it."

Who Do You Trust?

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT Bush won a major victory on patients' rights legislation in the House last week, but it was like so many other victories in Washington these days: close, partisan and probably fleeting. Ahead lies a far more difficult policy agenda that touches on profound philosophical divisions -- and Medicare is at the top of the list.
 After three years of debate, hundreds of campaign commercials and political commitments from all sides, the idea of creating prescription drug benefits for the 40 million elderly and disabled Americans on Medicare would appear to be an issue whose time has come. 
 Instead, as Congress headed home last week, the issue seemed intractable. Every attempt to add benefits or reshape the 36-year-old Medicare program keeps running into a fundamental conflict over the role of government: How much should Americans trust the innovation and energy of the private market -- in this case to deliver health benefits to the elderly? How much should they rely on the security and stability of the government? 
Medicare, like so much else in the nation's social policy, seems caught between two worlds: the glory days of the Great Society, when triumphant liberals considered Medicare the first step toward a system of universal government health insurance; and the heyday of Ronald Reagan and the Gingrich revolution, when triumphant conservatives dreamed of replacing the bureaucracy of many government programs with vouchers for use in a vibrant private marketplace.
This conflict over the role of government shapes much of the domestic agenda, from the debate over adding private investment accounts to Social Security to the struggle over creating vouchers so families can opt out of the public school system. And it was key to the debate over the $1.35 trillion tax cut won earlier this year by President Bush, who argued, "It's the people's money; it's not the government's money."
"Security" is the rallying cry for one side, which argues that government programs were put in place to address the failures of the private sector -- Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal are the touchstones -- and that Americans can do things as a group that they cannot do alone. "Choice" is the rallying cry for the other side, which argues that individuals, given the opportunity, can make better decisions for themselves than any government bureaucrat could.
For all the attempts to blur distinctions and appeal to the center, from "compassionate conservatism" to "the third way," this conflict has proved as sharp as a razor's edge in an evenly divided government. Nowhere is it more apparent than Medicare, the sturdy social insurance program pushed through Congress by President Lyndon B. Johnson. "There's an ideological stalemate similar to what preceded the creation of Medicare," said Theodore R. Marmor, a Yale professor and author of "The Politics of Medicare." "We are tied in knots in Congress about the role of government."
ALMOST no one believes Medicare should go unchanged. There is a clear need for prescription drug benefits; about a quarter of the elderly have none, the rest have limited, often unreliable coverage from former employers, supplemental plans or H.M.O.'s. There is also a powerful lobby and voting bloc -- the AARP delivered birthday cakes to every Congressional office last week to mark Medicare's birthday, with a piece cut out to symbolize the missing drug benefits.
Still, there is no consensus on how to add those benefits, whether they should be part of a broader overhaul, how much to spend on them, whether they should be provided primarily by private health plans or through the traditional Medicare program.
One camp, mostly Republican but including a few Democrats, wants to see drug benefits enacted only if Medicare is restructured to get more private health plans involved. Another camp, mostly Democrats, is suspicious of efforts to expand the role of private health plans, or, as Representative John Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, sometimes says, turning the elderly over to the "tender mercies of the H.M.O.'s."
For this is about two different worldviews. Traditional Democrats argue that the vaunted health insurance marketplace has never met the needs of the elderly -- not before the creation of Medicare, when half had no health insurance; and not in the current, limited experiment with H.M.O.'s in Medicare, which has seen numerous pullouts by private health plans complaining that they could not make a profit.
Medicare works, the traditionalists argue, because everyone contributes, everyone shares the risk, and everyone gets the same benefits -- with government administering the program and regulating payment levels.
The surest sign of its success, they argue, is its popularity, particularly in comparison to the world of managed care. "If you go up to the average citizen and say, we've got a great idea, we're going to help you, we're going to take Medicare and replace it with H.M.O.'s, people would think you were nuts," said Bruce C. Vladeck, the head of Medicare in the first Clinton administration.
Conservatives who advocate a more privatized Medicare argue that a system of one-size-fits-all benefits, which can essentially be changed only by an act of Congress, with rigid regulations imposed by the federal government, is outmoded. In President Bush's vision, the elderly will get a fixed amount of money to be spent in a marketplace of private plans competing for their business. And while older Americans could choose to stay with traditional Medicare, the market advocates have no doubt about where they will want to go.
"The plans will compete with each other, forcing them to offer better service, extra benefits and lower premiums," Mr. Bush has said. "We must trust seniors to make the right decisions for themselves." Conservatives also argue that the Medicare program, a last bastion of fee-for-service medicine, must become more cost-efficient before the onslaught of the baby boom retirees about a decade from now; more competition, they argue, will force that efficiency.
Much of this debate, on Medicare, Social Security and other issues, is driven by almost religious convictions -- like the belief that individuals will make wiser decisions about their retirement money than government. This debate, inevitably, is shaped by the times. The pro-market, pro-competition theology gained strength during the extraordinary economic expansion of the 1990's. Now, in a time of economic uncertainty, after a historically close election, the two camps seem far more balanced.
Robert J. Blendon, a professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, said the public is closely divided on whether government is doing too much or too little. But on Medicare, it's not a close call, particularly among the elderly.
Bill McInturff, who advises Republicans, said he tells his clients: "Seniors love the current Medicare program. This is not the time to relitigate the role of the federal government." Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, explained: "As you move down in the generations, there is probably a greater attraction to the idea of individual empowerment. But a lot of these debates, at the end of the day, are not about government versus individuals. They're about government versus big business." 
That, at least, is how the Democrats like to frame it; their enemy is rapacious drug companies and health insurers; the Republican demonology revolves around big government bureaucrats, though the Bush campaign managed an effective fusion last year, railing against "big government H.M.O.'s."
The positive case for social insurance is heard less often, says Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard. "There's an ambivalence that probably runs through both parties and runs through the minds of many Americans," she says, "because there haven't been frank statements in our political discourse about the value of sharing resources and sharing risks for a long time."
A conservative counterpoint comes from Stuart M. Butler, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation: "If you looked at it from outside, you'd say it clearly wouldn't work, and lo and behold, it doesn't."
In the debate over Medicare this fall, and later over Social Security, these worldviews will collide. Many analysts suggest that this deadlock can only be broken the way it was broken in the past -- one side wins, big, on Election Day, and gets a chance to try and legislate its vision.

HEADLINE: Al, Again 

 BODY:
Al Gore is coming back. We should have expected him. Bill Clinton came back last week, at a giddy welcoming party from the neighbors of his new Harlem office. The former president was looking so charismatic that it seemed it would be only a matter of time before Mr. Gore would pop up, too, so we could make unfavorable comparisons of his people skills.
 While Mr. Gore has been vacationing in Spain, growing a beard and working on a book with his wife, he has also been laying the groundwork for his re-emergence into public life. Later this month, he'll run some training sessions in Tennessee for young political activists. He intends to campaign for Democratic candidates this fall, and to start a new political action committee to help Congressional candidates in 2002. All this has naturally led to speculation that Mr. Gore is preparing to run again for president. 
 A lot has happened since the former vice president withdrew from public activity after George W. Bush's inauguration. Congress passed the tax-cut plan that Mr. Gore had denounced during the campaign. Mr. Bush shelved the international treaty on global warming that Mr. Gore had done so much to nurture. Last week, the House approved an energy bill that gave environmentalists the shivers.
Mr. Gore has always been one of his party's smartest and most articulate leaders -- on foreign affairs, communications issues and finance, as well as the environment. But he kept his reactions to himself, saying he wanted to refrain from criticizing the new president so America would have time to recover from the trauma of the Florida recount. Meanwhile, Mr. Bush and his allies used that time to promote programs that may have an effect on the country long after Florida has become a historical footnote.
Some Democrats were furious at the silence from the top. Others are still so angry about the loss of the White House that they don't have room for additional ire. It is probably fair to say that a sizable chunk of his party would be perfectly happy if Mr. Gore stayed out of sight indefinitely. He is, after all, the man who wrested defeat out of the longest economic boom in American history, the champion debater who managed to go 1 for 3 against George W. Bush.
Mr. Gore's fans point out that Richard Nixon rebuilt his political career after narrowly losing a race he should have won against John F. Kennedy. (It is a measure of Mr. Gore's luck that even his friends wind up comparing him to people like Mr. Nixon. And that 500,000-vote winning margin in the popular vote will mean a lifetime of being lumped with fellow Electoral College victims Samuel Tilden and Grover Cleveland.)
Obviously, Mr. Gore has a right to leap back into the presidential sweepstakes and take his chances. The number of invitations he gets to campaign for Democratic candidates in high-profile races over the next year will be one indication of how good his standing in the party is, and his success or failure as a drawing card may indicate something about the public's sentiments. It could be a tough comeback. There are plenty of other people, including virtually every Democrat in the Senate, who think they could have run a better race last year and are ready to try to prove it.
But Mr. Gore is sorely needed as a voice on behalf of the issues he championed in 2000. The Democrats have missed having a leader in the national debate over the Bush policies, particularly in foreign affairs and the environment. And if Mr. Gore decides to opt for being a sort of elder statesman rather than a presidential hopeful, he will never have to hear another critique of his wardrobe.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
In Both Substance and Style, Successor Will Be No Giuliani

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
For months, the six major candidates for mayor of New York City have encouraged voters to measure them by Rudolph W. Giuliani's yardstick. Even as they criticized Mr. Giuliani's style, they sought to assure New Yorkers that the change in leadership at City Hall next year would not bring an end to the policies that are widely credited with moving the city in the right direction.
 But a weeklong series of interviews with the candidates by editors and reporters of The New York Times suggests that the differences between Mr. Giuliani and the men trying to succeed him are more stark than the candidates want voters to think -- and go beyond the criticisms of Mr. Giuliani's style that they all have incorporated in their appeals. To varying degrees, and on many issues -- from police management to housing policy to the role of government in dealing with social problems -- the candidates presented ideas and views of government that were often quite different from anything New York has experienced in the past eight years. 
 On one level, the fact that the four Democratic candidates are beginning to promise a departure from Giuliani policies is not surprising, given their political backgrounds, their previous entanglements with the mayor and the fact that they are moving into the final five weeks of a party primary that has not yet seemed to capture the attention of voters. 
But even Herman Badillo, a Republican and the candidate who was the most effusive in his praise for Mr. Giuliani, moved in a flash from presenting his prospective mayoralty as an extension of Mr. Giuliani's to pledging to change the racial composition of the Police Department, and to require all 40,000 officers to undergo sensitivity training. Those are initiatives that would be hard to imagine coming out of the current City Hall.
The Democrats have spent the past six months trying to simultaneously criticize and praise a mayor who clearly remains popular among many voters. 
"I intend, as mayor, to offer what's the best of Rudy Giuliani without the worst," Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, said on Friday, in a remark that any of the six candidates could have made.
Still, the details that they laid out over the past week suggested that the exit of Mr. Giuliani would lead, as the mayor himself has predicted unhappily to his associates, to a return to policies that were in place before Mr. Giuliani became the city's first Republican mayor in nearly 20 years.
They talked about an increase in government services to help the poor, large public subsidies for housing construction and transportation, and rolling back tax cuts Mr. Giuliani had advocated. They talked about putting police officers back on the beat, and moving away from some aggressive police practices of the past eight years, even as they described the drop in crime that took place under Mr. Giuliani's Police Department as one of his biggest achievements.
Even Michael R. Bloomberg, Mr. Badillo's opponent in the Republican primary, advocated spending more money on the homeless, and financing and pushing ahead with big municipal construction projects even if the city's economic situation should turn bad, a contrast with the austerity that Mr. Giuliani preached during the last bad fiscal patch in New York.
Although the candidates uniformly described repairing the city school system as the biggest task facing the next mayor, they shied away from endorsing the proposals that Mr. Giuliani championed without success in this city dominated by Democrats and with a powerful teachers' union: experimentation with school vouchers and merit-pay raises for individual teachers. And, except for Mr. Badillo, none of the candidates displayed much of an appetite for challenging union policies, like cumbersome disciplinary procedures for bad teachers, which some educators argue must come to an end if there is to be a turnaround in New York's schools.
The extent of any differences that the candidates might have with the outgoing mayor has, until now, been masked by the perception that the city is moving in the right direction under Mr. Giuliani. Unlike, say, in 1993, when Mr. Giuliani was first elected, or in 1989, when David N. Dinkins defeated Edward I. Koch for the Democratic nomination, there is no great cry for change, no unpopular incumbent to run against.
This is creating complications for all the candidates as they try to come up with a campaign theme to ripple this placid race. With the exception of Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president who has approached the race as if Mr. Giuliani's name is on the ballot again, the candidates have taken a much more nuanced approach in criticizing a mayor who continues to occupy a large platform and shows no sign of staying on the sideline in the race to succeed him. That has usually meant criticizing his personal style, or his relationship with minority residents, while crediting him for an improvement in the areas of crime and quality of life.
But the series of interviews also made clear that there are gradations in the candidates' feelings toward Mr. Giuliani. At least three of them -- Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Badillo and Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker and a Democrat -- would like Mr. Giuliani's political support, or at least the support of the New Yorkers who have voted for him, and did not seem too eager to make him an issue.
By contrast, Mr. Hevesi and Mark Green, the public advocate and a Democrat, would like the support of Democrats who have not been happy with Mr. Giuliani -- and who, most politicians believe, will vote in large numbers in the primary on Sept. 11 -- as well as the potentially significant group of voters who approve of the mayor's performance and might have voted for him again if he were not stepping aside because of term limits. 
Thus, Mr. Green has moved from being persistently critical of Mr. Giuliani during his years as public advocate to trying (though not always successfully) to ratchet down his attacks on Mr. Giuliani, part of an attempt by Mr. Green to present himself as a more temperate and moderate public figure. 
By contrast, Mr. Hevesi, who has been criticized by some Democrats for standing in the shadows while his party colleagues battled Mr. Giuliani on a variety of fronts before the start of this election season, went out of his way in the interview to enumerate differences he said he had had with the Republican mayor over the years.
In inching away from Mr. Giuliani, all six major-party candidates are also beginning to draw some distinctions among themselves, providing an indication of the different ways they might govern the city. On the question of taxes, the centerpiece of Mr. Giuliani's economic policy, Mr. Vallone and Mr. Badillo ruled out any tax hike over the next four or eight years, and said they would push for further tax cuts in the years ahead, describing that as the best tonic for an ailing economy.
Mr. Hevesi said he would consider, in an economic downturn, pushing for a higher surcharge on the city's personal income tax, to pay for increased spending on schools. Such a surcharge would be similar to one that was used to finance an expansion of the Police Department under Mr. Dinkins.
Mr. Ferrer said he opposed the reduction in the income tax surcharge pushed through by Mr. Giuliani this year and would want to reinstitute the tax to pay for after-school programs for schoolchildren.
Mr. Green would not rule out raising taxes, though he said it was very unlikely. He said he was not certain whether he would push for any tax cuts.
Of all the candidates, Mr. Bloomberg had by far the most dire outlook on the city's economy, taking note of a series of signs -- declines on Wall Street, a drop in tourism -- that he said signaled that the next mayor would have to devote much energy to dealing with the budget. But Mr. Bloomberg sounded like the career public officials he is competing against in declining to spell out areas in city government that he might look to cut, should that prove necessary.
While the candidates, for the most part, declined to say what they would cut, they did use the interviews to name city departments that they said would be immune from cuts, offering suggestions of their top priorities for City Hall. Mr. Vallone said the city parks system, which he described as already beleaguered by budget cutbacks under Mr. Giuliani, would be spared further cuts. 
Mr. Green and Mr. Hevesi said they would not cut spending on the Police Department or public schools. Mr. Green also ruled out cuts for programs for elderly New Yorkers, while Mr. Hevesi said he would not make cuts in the Fire Department.
Mr. Badillo, sounding like Mr. Giuliani, said nothing would be exempt, while Mr. Bloomberg said he would protect the Police Department from cuts if the crime rate started moving up.
Even as they were vague about what they might do to save money, the Democrats and Mr. Bloomberg offered a variety of ways in which they would supported increased spending. All the candidates said teachers were not paid enough, arguing that that accounted in part for New York's inability to retain enough teachers to staff its schools. Mr. Ferrer said there should be a 30 percent increase in teacher salaries in exchange for some contract givebacks. His rivals declined to put a number on the table, saying it would complicate the collective-bargaining process.
Mr. Hevesi said the city's police officers should get larger raises than other uniformed officials, breaking from the way New York has historically negotiated contracts with its unions. He declined to offer a figure, or say how he would pay for that. Mr. Green offered arguments on both sides of that issue, saying that if elected, he would appoint a "labor czar" to advise him. 
Mr. Green pledged to hold class sizes to 19 students through the third grade. He said he would divert money, now being used to pay overtime to police officers to fight street crime, toward tuition assistance programs for young police officers. Mr. Ferrer called for weekend and after-school programs for children. Mr. Hevesi said he would establish 200 storefront computer centers around the city to help New Yorkers become computer literate.
On housing, nearly all the candidates seized on the promise of new revenues from the sale of the World Trade Center, promising to use much of that money to finance new housing. Mr. Bloomberg, though, said he would not support committing that revenue to housing, because the city should encourage private development by relieving regulations that he described as cumbersome.
Mr. Green separated himself from his Democratic colleagues by saying he would push to use the World Trade Center money to finance public transportation projects. He said he would support a large, subsidized housing construction project but would not say how he would pay for it. Instead, he vowed that should he win, he would appoint a committee of people to advise him on where to find the housing money.

When Love and Work Clash in the Valley

 BODY:
 It has not been an easy year for Bruce Claflin, the chief executive of 3Com, the Silicon Valley networking equipment company that has been hit especially hard by the economic slowdown. But Mr. 
Claflin, 49, said during a visit to New York last week that the most difficult period for him was in January, just after he was appointed to the job. Worried about a sharp falloff in business, Mr. Claflin moved to cut thousands of jobs. He was among the first prominent technology executive to say publicly that things were looking bad. But what really gnawed at Mr. Claflin, he said, was that his wife preferred to believe the less gloomy outlook offered at the time by John Chambers, the chief executive of 3Com's rival, Cisco Systems. "My wife said she loved me, but that John Chambers knew a lot more than I did," he recalled. "Then it was personal."

HEADLINE: A Scholarship And a Crisis 

BYLINE:  By Peter Lagerquist; Peter Lagerquist, a freelance writer, contributes regularly to Middle East International, a London-based magazine.

DATELINE: Ramallah, West Bank 

 BODY:
The Palestinian uprising that erupted last fall put an abrupt end to Bill Clinton's efforts to secure a foreign policy legacy -- a lasting peace in the Middle East. Almost one year later, scores of Israelis and hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, with thousands wounded. 
 Against this backdrop, the first of the Clinton Scholars -- prospective leaders of Palestinian industry, civil society and government -- are returning home from graduate school in the United States, as dozens more leave to begin their studies. The Clinton Scholarship aims to strengthen American-Palestinian relations and to encourage social and economic development in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But the students -- future entrepreneurs, teachers and public servants -- face a daunting mission: since the uprising, relations with the United States have been strained by continuing Palestinian confrontations with Israel, and the Palestinian economy they are charged with rebuilding has collapsed. 
 The scholarship, under the auspices of the United States Agency for International Development, or U.S.A.I.D., grew out of the 1998 Wye River memorandum, an agreement signed in Wye River, Md., committing Israel and the Palestinian Authority to restart then-stalled peace negotiations. To bolster Palestinian support for the accord, President Clinton pushed through Congress $400 million in development assistance to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a significant portion going to people-to-people programs, including $15 million for a scholarship. 
"The intent was to further Palestinian development by fostering a free-market economy, training skilled businesspeople to be its future captains of industry," said Pat Kabra, a consulate spokeswoman in Jerusalem. "Over all, this is the kind of thing U.S.A.I.D. supports through its educational initiatives around the world. It improves the ability of that country to act as a business interlocutor for us."
The scholarship, which the Bush administration is to review once funds are exhausted, will fully finance 95 students: 80 have been accepted since the program began in June 1999, with 40 expected to be enrolled this fall in American universities and 20 more in preparatory courses. Applicants are screened with an emphasis on undergraduate performance and their ability to articulate how their training would benefit their community. As with the agency's other educational programs, politics are not discussed, and participation in the uprisings does not necessarily disqualify Palestinians from entry into the United States, according to consular officials. 
The Palestinian territories have some of the highest university enrollment rates in the Arab Middle East, and as elsewhere in the developing world, American master's degrees are highly sought after. With average annual incomes of $2,000, most Palestinians would find the scholarship difficult to pass up, despite wariness about furthering an official American agenda in the region. "The U.S. has certain goals for the world and especially the third world -- to think like them and embrace the free market -- so they send us to U.S. universities," concluded Raed Awashreh, a Clinton Scholar who arrived in the United States this summer. But he envisions the scholarship as a chance to build mutual understanding. "All the time I have wanted to know more about American society," he said. "I will meet new people and be open-minded to other religions and cultures." Laila al-Haddad, who is a year into her master's in public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, is similarly ambivalent. "Did I get the scholarship to implement their values?" she wondered. "But I'm doing what I want to do. This is something that is good for Palestine."
For this year's recipients, the chance to study in the United States has been especially hard fought. Frequent fighting, coupled with Israeli road blockades, has made travel both time-consuming and dangerous. The Academy for Educational Development, an American organization that administers the program from offices in Ramallah and Gaza City, reports fewer applicants than when the program started. "People can't get to our offices to pick up the paperwork," said Jamilah Abed, a training assistant with the organization. Some candidates in the fall class had to be interviewed over the phone; since March, this has become standard procedure out of fairness to all applicants. And since the Graduate Management Admissions Test, or G.M.A.T., is not offered in Gaza, business school candidates who live there have not been able to fulfill their test requirements. 
The uprising has only intensified already existing social and economic problems. With peace and Palestinian self-rule in the mid-90's, the West Bank and Gaza Strip began to see some development, but the Palestinian Authority was soon criticized as corrupt and its security forces as repressive. The territories continued to depend on Israel for jobs and access to international markets. Now, the closing of roads and border crossings has brought the economy to a standstill. About 100,000 Palestinian workers have lost jobs in Israel, and one in every three Palestinians has fallen below the poverty line of $2 a day, according to World Bank estimates. 
"It is ironic," Ms. al-Haddad said. "This scholarship was meant to be Clinton's legacy. At the same time, as we arrived in the U.S., we saw this legacy crumble before our eyes, along with the society and infrastructure we were supposed to build."
Amid the disillusionment and violence, some of the Clinton Scholars spoke about past and future challenges, their goals and their encounters with America.
Raed Awashreh, 31, was arrested by the Israeli Army during the first Palestinian uprising, from 1987 to 1993, and released after three years in military detention camps. After the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, he joined a high school refresher course for former detainees, which allowed him to enroll in 1995 in Bir Zeit, the premier Palestinian university, located just outside Ramallah. With a major in business administration and minor in journalism, he went on to work as a journalist and researcher. Mr. Awashreh, who would like to teach, will study public administration this fall at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California, where he is taking a class this summer in English as a second language.
"I was participating in the first intifada. For one year and a half I was wanted by the Israelis, living on the run. Sometimes I slept under buildings or trees. During the interrogation they tortured me -- beatings, they hung me from a pole. I don't like to speak about it, because it is very private, and it is the past. But I remember in particular the 'zinzana,' a room the size of a box, so small you can't lie down, where they put me for a week. 
"The prison was both good and bad, however. We ran a good education program, which helped me when I went to university. Some of the books came from the Red Cross, others the prisoners smuggled in without the knowledge of the army. Some materials the prisoners themselves wrote. I read art, economics, psychology, sociology. 
"In the prison I also started working as a journalist. I wrote a magazine without the knowledge of Israeli guards. There were a number of other contributors -- in truth, every person in the prison wanted to be a journalist. Today, if you look at the people working for television and radio stations here, you'll find they are all graduates of the prisons. 
"I started to work for the Bank of Jordan as a credit analyst. I liked it. They give you the chance to work and to improve yourself. They paid for me to take English language courses at the British consulate.
"There are two problems with journalism. First, the money is not enough -- I have a family. Second, there isn't sufficient freedom of expression here, not enough democracy. In 1998, I participated in a Bir Zeit student march. It was in solidarity with Nablus University, whose campus had been raided by the Palestinian security forces. We marched on a government building under the banner of 'Democracy.' Two months later Palestinian security forces arrested me on the pretext that I had participated in an illegal march. I was only kept in jail for 14 days, but they put me in a zinzana, too smiling , though it was slightly bigger than the Israeli one.
"As for politics, I am not impressed by any American administration, because of what I have seen on the ground here in the West Bank and Gaza. This scholarship is perhaps the first good thing America has done for us. However, I think U.S. society is not well informed about us -- they imagine us as not quite human perhaps. I think Americans are quite straightforward, and I hope that I can maybe give them a better understanding of myself and my country."
 Hisham Jabi, 31, was hired in 1994 by the Modern Arabian Business Corporation, or Mabco, an office technology equipment retailer and service provider, to open a branch in the territories. By the beginning of the uprising, it had grown to 40 employees with $2.5 million in annual revenues. In 1999, Mr. Jabi co-founded the Palestinian Information Technology Association, or PITA, a trade group of 45 companies, and has since become a spokesman for the local high-tech industry. ("Yes, there is one," he said, smiling. "I've had Americans ask me that. Do they think we live in tents?") Mr. Jabi, whose family runs a successful trucking company, is now in Boulder, Colo., at the Economics Institute, where scholarship winners in business administration take courses to improve their G.M.A.T. scores and chances of landing in a preferred university. As head of the Ramallah chapter of the Rotary Club, he is also giving talks at the local club and volunteering at a hospital -- "not only to meet Americans but to do something that makes you belong to their community."
"At the moment I stepped into class at Bir Zeit, the first intifada started. We had to get our classes sometimes in lecture halls, sometimes in churches, sometimes in public facility buildings. It took me six years to finish my degree in accounting.
"One year later I was offered a job to establish Mabco in Palestine. They had high expectations of the new era in Palestine after the peace process. But despite our autonomy, we had tremendous barriers in establishing businesses here. We had to import our products through Israeli ports and airports. I had to learn Hebrew fluently in the first year to argue with them. I had to learn Israeli law by heart.
"I wanted to show Israelis that even Palestinians who could not have the chance to live in Georgetown or New York can be civilized and tell the world that we are professionals not only at bombs, but are able to communicate with the whole world in a professional business manner. I wanted to show my friends in Israel that we can do it. 
"People here are suspicious of trade with Israel and the U.S. There is talk of them trying to penetrate the Middle East, to establish economic hegemony. But if globalization really is this irresistible wave, then there is no hiding from it. We have to use it to our advantage and to learn from others. It was my activities in PITA that made me feel I have to go into an M.B.A. program. I have been traveling all over the world -- Thailand, Taiwan, China, Japan, Singapore -- meeting multinational organizations, and talking about information technology as a vehicle to develop the Palestinian economy. For me to realize this I need communication skills, better English, better managerial skills, better I.T. exposure, better multinational business exposure. If I stay in Palestine I will never get this experience. 
"It will depend on our performance, if the scholarship is to endure. Taxpayers in the U.S. understand figures. I will try as much as I can to talk business, to talk figures. I am hoping to put Palestine on the global map. It is in the heart of every Christian, Jew and Muslim. Now Israel controls the valves of our economy. We have no control of our own destiny. In the future, everything is possible, once they remove the tanks from our roads."
Laila al-Haddad, 23, the only Clinton Scholar at an Ivy League university, was born in Kuwait and attended school in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Both her parents, who are doctors, have returned to their homeland, Gaza. Ms. al-Haddad graduated magna cum laude from Duke University in May 2000. This summer, on a grant from the Women and Public Policy Program at the Kennedy School at Harvard, she is working in Ramallah with a democracy and human rights organization run by Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Arab League and a former Palestinian politician. 
"The last question that the scholarship interview committee asked me was: 'You have a formidable background, and opportunities abroad. Why would you want to go back to Gaza?' I said simply that my roots are here, and that's where I think my education can be of most use. I felt a strong sense of responsibility after the intifada broke out. I wanted to be on the ground right now. The social and economic infrastructure is deteriorating now.
"I met Ashrawi when I was president of the Arab Student Society at Duke and we invited her to come and speak. I always found her very inspiring and have looked up to her since I was a teenager. People relate to what she says in humanistic terms, and that is something I see myself doing on a small scale. She gets criticized by Israelis for the positions she takes, but also by Palestinians. I am not surprised to hear it. It's only natural of a woman working in this field. 
"For personal reasons I wear a head scarf, and I have gotten very used to being perceived as backward and uneducated. In the U.S. I often get asked, 'What does it feel like to be oppressed?' It's a huge factor in developing myself to prove that not only Arab women but Muslim women can be leaders. It is also a perception in the Arab world that, both religiously and culturally, it's not where women should be. The way to deal with it is to set an example in how you conduct yourself. This is how I feel I am making an impact. 
"It's an important point for the Clinton Scholarship to get more women. I am constantly harassing them about this. There aren't many Palestinian women leaders in business, and as a program that primarily targets this field, they have problems getting female applicants. We have a high percentage of women with degrees, particularly compared to other Arab countries. The problem is getting them into the labor force. 
"I was and am still a believer in people-to-people contact, and being in a policy school has been a unique opportunity in that regard. There were people at the school who make decisions for the U.S. government, for the Israeli government. A number of them were lawyers and had worked as chief negotiators with the Palestinians. In the beginning of the intifada they were very confused -- they didn't know what was happening or why. They didn't see the frustration on the ground, that the fruits of the peace process were only reaped by the Palestinian Authority, not the population. Their only other contact with Palestinians was during the first intifada, serving as soldiers in Gaza. The only relationship they knew was of occupier/occupied. I felt that in the end, I made them understand. I used to go with workers in Gaza through the Israeli checkpoints when I was doing research. It gave me a different perspective.
"There are always ebbs and flows in any conflict, looking at Northern Ireland, for instance. Sometimes breakthroughs come after an extended period of violence. But I am positive in a cynical way -- Palestinians are pessoptimists."
Mohammed Said, 36, returned home in June from Colorado State University in Fort Collins as the first graduate of the Clinton Scholarship. A carpenter's son, he grew up in a West Bank village with six brothers and two sisters. He supported himself selling home improvement supplies as a student at Bir Zeit, but because of frequent Israeli closings of Palestinian universities during the first intifada, it took seven years to get his degree in business administration. He most recently worked as financial manager for a government citizens' rights organization. Mr. Said is considering teaching business administration or consulting.
"My father doesn't own any land and could just earn our daily bread, so we struggled. My mother is a housekeeper -- she is illiterate, but I respect her a lot. During the intifada, one of my brothers was arrested for two years, a second was wanted by the Israelis and on the run. We didn't see him for five years. My kid brother was arrested when he was 13 for throwing stones at the Israelis, and jailed for one and a half years. He lost his education, his future. He has opened a car workshop. It's a pity, because Palestinians have one resource, education. If you look at my village, in every family there are at least two children nowadays with university degrees.
"If you have democracy and raise awareness of human rights, you can build a new nation on a rock, not on sand. We Palestinians are better off than neighboring Arab countries, maybe because we have some 20 organizations active in human rights. But there are lots of violations. We lack institutions, such as a strong legislative council, and good public sector management. 
"To be frank I had been dreaming of doing an M.B.A. in the U.S. I tried many times and was accepted in many universities, but I didn't have the resources to go. I was unlucky for some time -- I was 35 when I got this scholarship. They have a lot of resources we miss at home -- the library, the Internet -- and I appreciate that the professors are always available. But the most important thing was the teamwork. We had to work in groups for a number of projects. We had some Chinese and Indian students and it was very rewarding to encounter and share differences, experiences and views. 
"I wrote a business plan for my course, to start an Internet service provider in Palestine, because being online with other cultures is very important to both society and economy in Palestine. One of our problems is that we have just one supplier through Israel, so I suggest making a strategic alliance with an Israeli firm. I can see opportunity on the horizon, not just financially, but as a national symbol of independence and modernization. In Europe after World War II, they sought to join economic interests to make sure they didn't fight again, and this worked. I believe this will work here, too. We have a lot to learn from the Israelis; they have a lot of experience in finance, information technology and industry. We cannot go on with bloodshed like this.
"When I came to the U.S., everyone had their stereotypes and prejudices. Everywhere I met people, in the market, in the stores, and I talked to them. When I went to the barber I initiated political discussions. It was foremost in my mind that as Americans they support Israel. And they had ideas about me. But I found that the majority of American people are very nice, very open-minded. When you listen to them, you see there is a logic in their views. They ask, 'Why should we, American taxpayers, care about what goes on in the world?' I think they should care, because they are, as they put it, leaders of the free world. Maybe it's in their interest to help others. I think it's in our mutual interest."

HEADLINE: Smithsonian Must Exhibit Ingenuity in the Face of Overlapping Gifts 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5 

 BODY:
The Smithsonian Institution has discovered that it is indeed possible to have an embarrassment of riches.
 The institution's National Museum of American History has accepted two gifts for permanent exhibitions that cover much of the same ground and would together take up about 10 percent of the museum's exhibition space. The gifts come from two of the museum's largest donors, so museum officials are now in the unusual position of trying to determine how to honor both contracts. 
 Earlier this year the Catherine B. Reynolds Foundation pledged $38 million for what was widely characterized as a hall of fame of achievers. Ms. Reynolds's contract with the Smithsonian says the money will finance "an interactive exhibition that tells the life stories of eminent Americans, describes their personal characteristics that contributed to their achievements and highlights those achievements." 
But the museum and its advisory board realized only belatedly that the project overlapped with one that was financed last year with part of an $80 million gift from Kenneth E. Behring, a California real estate developer. His was the largest single gift in the Smithsonian's history and followed a gift of $20 million he made in 1997. 
About $20 million of Mr. Behring's $80 million is to pay, his contract with the Smithsonian says, for a "thematic hall" that will focus on "American legends and legacies" and be "a tribute to deceased individuals who made great contributions to our country and who truly epitomize the 'American spirit.' " 
Under the terms of that contract the museum must allot 18,000 to 20,000 square feet to this exhibition. The contract with Ms. Reynolds says that her exhibition will encompass 10,000 square feet and include a related awards program. 
Copies of the contracts, which have not been made public, were made available by Smithsonian officials who do not want the projects to proceed. 
Ivan Selin, the chairman of the museum, said the museum did not realize the potential conflict between the two exhibitions until it was too late. "The museum didn't accept the Reynolds gift knowing that we had a conflict with the Behring gift," he said. "Only as we looked into it did it become clear that there was overlap and that the potential for duplication and confusion was high. We don't know how this is going to work out right now." 
The negotiations with Ms. Reynolds, particularly in the early stages, were largely carried out by Lawrence M. Small, the Smithsonian's secretary, and Sheila Burke, an under secretary, with little input from the museum staff and its board, Mr. Selin said. A result, he added, was "a lack of mutual understanding of what the Reynolds project would be before the Smithsonian agreed to the gift."
"It isn't fatal," he continued, "but it has left open questions that might have been answered before the contract was signed."
Museum officials acknowledge the risk of duplication. "We have to think this through to make sure the halls are complementary and that there not be repetition," Spencer R. Crew, the museum's director, said in a telephone interview. "We need to sit down and talk about that now."
Mr. Selin, a businessman and former under secretary of state for management and former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that his advisory board was prepared to monitor both projects closely. "If it seems to be turning out to be quite difficult to make these exhibitions complementary, we will become much more involved," he said. 
Asked whether it was possible to fuse or link the exhibitions, Mr. Selin said, "That's one of the many alternatives that the museum is giving consideration to."
But museum officials said linkage was no longer an option. "It wouldn't be a Behring-Reynolds exhibition hall," said Martha Morris, the museum's deputy director. Each contract explicitly names each exhibition's hall after the donor or donor designee, subject to approval by the museum's board of regents. 
Each of the Smithsonian's 16 museums has its own advisory board, but the boards vary in their level of involvement and oversight. The Smithsonian's board of regents, led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, serves as the institution's governing body. Because the regents meet only three times a year, they do not study many issues in detail.
Mr. Crew said the museum considered consolidating the exhibitions several months ago, with Mr. Behring's focusing on dead Americans and Ms. Reynolds's focusing on living ones. But as Ms. Reynolds's project became more historical in nature, he added, "our thinking began to change." Ms. Reynolds declined a request for an interview. Sheila Tate, the spokeswoman for her foundation, said, "Mrs. Reynolds believes the exhibitions are complementary, and it is the museum's business to mesh the concepts."
Mr. Behring was traveling and unavailable for comment. His son, David, a member of the museum's board, did not return phone calls. Both Mr. Crew and Ms. Morris said they had not begun substantive discussions with Mr. Behring on how to define his exhibition, although such work had begun on Ms. Reynolds's project. Asked what might be proposed to Mr. Behring, Mr. Crew said: "There is nowhere in the museum where the breadth of American history is laid out. We could still highlight American achievers but do it in a timeline." 
Mr. Behring's attention has been focused on some of his projects at the history museum, including its redesign and renovation and another $20 million "thematic hall" that is to largely replace the existing military hall, encompass 18,000 to 20,000 square feet and be named for him "as he designates," his contract states. 
The museum has already fulfilled the clause in the $80 million contract that requires the words "Behring Center" to "appear prominently" at two entrances of the museum and to be used on all of the museum's signs, catalogs, Web sites, virtual tours and outreach and educational programs whenever the name of the museum is used. Both the Reynolds and Behring gifts have been criticized in the museum world. Some museum professionals charge that Mr. Small has allowed wealthy donors to dictate the nature and content of the museum's exhibitions. The museum, like the Smithsonian as a whole, receives about 70 percent of its funds from Congress.
Last spring a group of curators, historians and researchers wrote a letter to the regents complaining that the Behring and Reynolds gifts "breach established standards of museum practice and professional ethics." The Organization of American Historians has asked the regents to reconsider the agreement with Ms. Reynolds, calling reports about the role of private donors in shaping museum exhibitions troubling. 
The museum held a two-day session in June that brought together Ms. Reynolds, historians, designers, and museum officials. They agreed that the Reynolds exhibition would tell "inspiring stories" of living and dead Americans within a "broader historical context that explores changing perceptions of achievement over time," according to a memo drafted after the meeting. The story of Rosa Parks, the civil rights pioneer, for example, would frame her life within the broader civil rights movement, the memo says.
Since attracting teenagers is an important goal of the exhibition, "special attention will be given to high-profile exemplars and issues that resonate with teenagers," the memo says. The exhibition also is to include lesser-known Americans who show how one person can have an impact on events, and stories that embrace differences in "race, class, gender, age, national origin and economic station," the memo says. 
The exhibition is also to deal with people who had "less than noble motives," like the financier J. P. Morgan, the memo adds, and others who were considered "controversial in their time," like the architect Maya Lin or the songwriter and performer Bob Dylan, and others who became controversial later, like the aviator Charles A. Lindbergh. 
Ms. Reynolds said in an interview in May that her list of potential candidates included the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jonas Salk, Martha Stewart, Oprah Winfrey and Michael Jordan. Her contract says the Smithsonian retains final approval over the exhibition.

A Caustic Look In the Mirror From Boomers

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Joe Queenan is 50 years old and sorely ashamed of it.
 "I loathe my generation," he said last week. "We became culturally frozen in time at a very early age and continue to think of ourselves as trailblazers. It's completely pathetic." 
 A writer who contributes frequently to GQ and Forbes, Mr. Queenan's latest book, "Balsamic Dreams: A Short but Self-Important History of the Baby Boomer Generation" (Henry Holt), chronicles the cultural irrelevance of his generation, which is -- at least to Mr. Queenan -- a whiny, narcissistic bunch of paunchy, corporatized losers.
And he is not alone in his distaste. 
A body of literature -- call it boomer bashing -- has emerged from the trenches of American popular writing. As the 80 million Americans born from 1945 to 1963 have begun to slip en masse over the dreaded benchmark known as the big five-oh, a squadron of journalists, editors and authors have begun to question the abilities and point out the failures of the Woodstock Generation. Because most of those churning out the criticism are boomers themselves, the bashing also has the distinct whiff of boomer self-loathing.
Along with Mr. Queenan's book, this year also saw the publication of "What if Boomers Can't Retire? How to Build Real Security, Not Phantom Wealth," by Thornton Parker (Berrett-Koehler Publishers), which criticized their reliance on the stock market as a kind of phantom wealth that could eventually derail the entire American economy. Pow! 
David Brooks's excoriation of yuppie boomers, "Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There" (Simon & Schuster, 2000), stayed on best-seller lists last year for four months, urging boomers to recognize themselves as hypocritical sellouts. Blam!
There was Marty Asher's darkly comic novel, "The Boomer" (Knopf, 2000), which opens with the birth of a baby boomer on a Friday and after a lifetime of excruciating banality ends in "a small, tidy cemetery with a view of the ocean." Ooof! 
In June of last year, Time magazine published an article called "Twilight of the Boomers" in which Daniel Okrent described the boomers as preening, self-congratulatory, cavilling solipsists. Sock-o! 
And that was the nice part. He then slammed his readers. "If you're like the overwhelming majority of boomers, your career has hit a brick wall, you haven't saved enough, your pension is underfunded, your health is deteriorating, even the medical advances that will probably extend your life will, in an especially cruel paradox, probably mean that later life will be meaner and more spartan."
Mr. Okrent, 53, said that boomers were pretty much fatuous, self-important and lazy, and that's why they arouse so much resentment from Americans in their 20's and 30's. 
"There is so, so much to loathe about the boomers," Mr. Okrent said, as he spoke by telephone from his vacation home in sunny Cape Cod, doing his own boomer duty to arouse resentment. "And there is this sudden spate of attention to boomers because they have finally reached real age. They used to think they would be young forever, and now they know they will not."
"My loathing is not for the fact of being a boomer," he said. "It is for the boomers' self-involvement, and for my generation's belief that we were special. It was just another generation."
Really? Even with the Vietnam War, Woodstock, Kent State? 
"We were powerful in numbers, and we had something to react against," he said. "That was the virtue of the Vietnam War. It gave us direction."
While the boomer-bashers are happy to skewer "their desperate and pathetic cult of the self," to use Mr. Queenan's words, there are also boomer apologists to prop up their ever-jowlier self-esteem and explain away their sins.
Priscilla Painton, an assistant managing editor at Time magazine who oversaw last week's Time cover story, "Do Kids Have Too Much Power?", said that Time's boomer readers were always hungry for more information about whether they are raising their kids to be spoiled brats. Last week, the answer -- according to Time -- was no. 
"The story really looked at the criticism leveled at baby boomers, that they have given their children too much power," Ms. Painton said. "And we came to the conclusion that these kids are turning out to be one of the healthiest generations, so maybe there is no blame to lay on the boomers."
Susan Faludi's last book, "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man" (William Morrow, 1999), advanced the theory that the male boomers, especially those born immediately after World War II, were emotionally disfigured by their fathers, cold and patriarchal men who taught their sons that power -- not the nurturing of family or community -- was the only goal worthy of male aspiration. So for that set of male boomers, their stunted self-absorption was not their fault, but that of their Archie Bunker-esque fathers. 
Betsy Carter, the editor in chief of My Generation, the boomer magazine published by AARP, said that boomer-bashing literature was the outgrowth of unprecedented navel-gazing. 
"You have never had a group that is so primed to be analytical and examine themselves," she said. "And we're also the first generation to be so vocal and so public about our failures and our misgivings."
Ms. Carter, 56, said that boomers' eagerness to talk about themselves may also be why other generations -- or other boomers -- tire of the ceaseless boomer meditations.
"We tell everybody everything," she said. "We can yack and yack and yack. If you're not one of us, it probably gets really boring."
Mr. Queenan said that it was precisely that endless yacking and the parading of bad taste as good taste that inspired him to write "Balsamic Dreams."
"When soft rock hit in the early 1970's, I think people just thought the generation was taking a nap," he said. "In reality, we were going to sleep. We never woke up again."
That soporific cultural stupor is why Sylvester Stallone is a highly paid movie star, Mr. Queenan said, and why Andrea Bocelli has become a cultural staple masquerading as high art when he should really be accorded the status of, say, Zamfir, master of the pan flute.
"I am still amazed that it is my generation that actually supported Sylvester Stallone's career and watched those movies," Mr. Queenan said. "That wasn't the way it was supposed to play out. We weren't all supposed to buy the same foods, watch the same movies, listen to the same music. I mean, does everyone have to listen to Andrea Bocelli? Does every boomer have to go to the same four towns in Northern Italy? Has any boomer ever gone to Southern Italy? Say, Sicily? There's a tremendous pack mentality."
David Brooks, the author of "Bobos in Paradise," said there was only more to come. 
"Boomers have to exhaust all varieties of narcissistic experience, and having run through self-adoration and self-love and all the other self-somethings, now they have to do self-loathing," he said. "They have just begun to tap into it."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
An annual survey forecasts slow growth in communications spending for the next five years.

BYLINE:  By Jane L. Levere 

 BODY:
THE investment banking firm of Veronis Suhler is forecasting an increase in advertising spending next year but a slowdown through 2005 in the growth of this spending and in the communications industry as a whole.
 In its 15th annual communications industry forecast, released today, the firm, which specializes in the media, predicted that advertising spending in the United States would increase 6.9 percent next year. 
 This would follow an 11.1 percent increase in 2000 -- which was driven by double-digit growth in broadcast television, consumer magazine, Internet and radio advertising -- and what it expects will be a 1.1 percent decline this year "as advertisers reduce their budgets in the wake of the economic downturn and dot-com shakeout."
For 2000 to 2005, the firm expects total spending to climb 4.9 percent a year; in the previous five years, growth was 8.9 percent a year. 
Through 2005, the firm also expects a slowdown in growth in the communications industry, including advertising spending, marketing services and specialty media like direct mail and the purchases of books, home videos or trade magazines. 
From 1995 to 2000, the firm said, the communications industry grew 7.9 percent a year, while for the period 2000 to 2005, it predicted that the industry would grow 5.5 percent.
Noting that communications was the second-fastest-growing sector of the economy from 1995 to 2000, Veronis Suhler projected that it would be only the sixth-fastest in the next five years. The firm attributed this decline to "a slower-growing economy, slower growth in advertising expenditures and tamer consumer spending."
James P. Rutherfurd, the firm's executive vice president, said the slower growth was a result of the maturing of certain industry segments and a slowdown in the general economy.
Mr. Rutherfurd said that the economy grew 6 percent a year from 1995 to 2000 and that Veronis Suhler expected growth of 5 percent a year from 2000 to 2005.
"Some communications businesses are getting more mature than they were in previous years," he said. "For example, cable is still the highest-growing business, but its growth is getting less because it's almost doubled in size in the last five years. Now it's penetrating a lot more households. The broadcast TV market is getting tougher and tougher. And the Internet, which barely existed five years ago, is in a maturing process."
In addition, he said businesses like books, magazines and newspapers are "very mature and growing at slower and slower rates."
But Mr. Rutherfurd said he did not find the slower growth alarming.
"In the context of five years of incredible boom times in the national and communications economy," he said, "it's pretty hard to replicate these growth rates, with some exceptions. It looks like for the industry as a whole it's steady-as-you-go growth, with pockets of high growth and pockets of slower growth."
One segment projected to have a high growth rate is cable, including cable TV access, advertising sales and licensing fees. These are expected to increase 9.1 percent a year through 2005, which will make cable the largest segment of the communications industry, replacing newspapers. Internet access and advertising are expected to increase 7.3 percent, while outdoor advertising is expected to rise 7.6 percent and sponsorships are expected to increase 9.4 percent.
Segments with the smallest increase are books, estimated to grow 2.4 percent; broadcast television, expected to rise 3.1 percent; and consumer magazines and newspapers, both expected to grow 3.7 percent.
Besides slower growth in the communications industry through 2005, Veronis Suhler is also predicting a decline in consumer spending on media. Consumer spending increased 7.8 percent from 1995 to 2000; it is expected to grow 5.4 percent through 2005.
Consumer spending on the Internet, which grew 44.7 percent from 1995 to 2000, is expected to increase 9.6 percent through 2005, while spending on home videos is expected to grow 5 percent after an increase of 7.7 percent in the previous five years. Video games, whose spending jumped 19.9 percent from 1995 to 2000, will increase 10.3 percent through 2005.
In addition, the firm found that people spent less time with media that have significant advertiser support -- broadcast TV, newspapers, magazines and radio. The annual hours spent on these media fell 9.2 percent from 1995 to 2000, while the time was expected to increase slightly, 0.4 percent, from 2000 to 2005. 
The time spent on media supported predominantly by consumers -- cable and satellite television, recorded music, books, home video and video games, film and the Internet -- increased 37.2 percent from 1995 to 2000 and is projected to rise an additional 12.2 percent from 2000 to 2005. 
Veronis Suhler also found that in 1995, 69.3 percent of consumers' time was spent with media with advertiser support, while this figure fell to 60 percent in 2000 and is expected to drop to 57.2 percent in 2005.
Mr. Rutherfurd said changes in consumer preferences "are clearly not a good sign for advertisers."
"Over time, people are spending more and more time with the media they buy themselves," he said. "Advertisers are going to have to fight harder and harder for attention in an increasingly cluttered world, even before they fight for attention among themselves."

BT Offered $25.7 Billion For Its Fixed-Line Network
A consortium led by a major German bank has offered to buy the fixed-line network of British Telecommunications for $:18 billion, or $25.7 billion, people close to the discussions said.
 The offer, by Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, is more comprehensive than an earlier $11.4 billion bid for British Telecom's local loop -- the copper wires that connect 28 million customers to its network. BT rebuffed that offer, from an American group made up of Babcock & Brown, an asset finance company, and Chancery Lane Capital, an investment bank, late last month. Page C2. 

Ratings Plunge for Network Reruns
Ratings for repeats of the networks' series are mostly in free fall this summer, giving another headache to executives, who were already facing a sharp falloff in advertising dollars for this fall's programs. The summertime flight from the networks has been especially intense for dramatic shows that have been on the air a number of years. Even "ER," the most popular and expensive show in network television, is seeing its repeats hit all-time lows; ratings are down 16 percent. Executives are wondering whether the demise of the summer rerun means that the economic model for network TV, which has always been based on getting two runs of every series episode, is facing collapse.

Web Merchants Turn to Offline Mail
Ever since e-commerce companies began to slump, e-mail marketing has been hailed as a low-cost way to reach consumers and bring customers back for more.

Telephone Fight Shifts in Brazil
Executives of Brasil Telecom, one of the largest fixed-line telephone companies in Brazil, are hoping that the purchase in late July of Telecom Italia -- by the Pirelli and Benetton groups of Italy -- will end a squabble between Telecom Italia and a Brazilian investment bank, Grupo Opportunity, which are partners in the fixed-line business.

HEADLINE: Brazilians Uneasy Despite Help by I.M.F. 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 5 

 BODY:
The $15 billion in loans that the International Monetary Fund unexpectedly offered Brazil on Friday puts some distance between this country and its troubled neighbor Argentina. But the deal is likely to fall short, financial analysts here predicted this weekend, of establishing the foolproof fire wall from the troubles next door that Brazil has been seeking.
 The monetary fund's latest support plan for Brazil is a result of a deepening recession in Argentina and of growing fears that the government there will default on $128 billion in debt. 
 The events of 1997 and 1998, when a financial crisis in Asia spread to Russia and eventually forced Brazil to devalue its currency by 40 percent, are still fresh in investors' minds. And so the action is intended to calm fears of a "contagion" that would spread from one afflicted economy to all developing nations. 
In announcing the new loan package late on Friday, after markets here and in the United States had closed, the fund's managing director, Horst Kohler, was careful to distinguish Brazil's situation from Argentina's. 
He praised what he called "Brazil's strong track record" and lauded the Brazilian authorities for "strengthening fiscal and monetary policies and implementing their structural reform agenda in the face of a difficult external environment."
That ringing endorsement for the world's eighth-largest economy promises to calm, at least temporarily, the stock and foreign exchange markets here, both of which have been buffeted in recent months by spillover from the crisis in Argentina.
Since February, for instance, the value of Brazil's currency, the real, has fallen by nearly 25 percent against the United States dollar, closing on Friday at 2.505 to the dollar.
The timing of the agreement and, above all, the rapidity with which it was reached, came as a surprise to many here. Brazil signed a $41.5 billion accord with international lenders in November 1998. But that agreement expires on Dec. 1, and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said several times earlier this year that it would not be necessary to renew it.
But late in July, with Argentina's situation worsening, Arminio Fraga, the president of Brazil's Central Bank, made a quick trip to Washington, where he met with officials of the monetary fund. 
At the time, I.M.F. and Brazilian officials characterized the contacts as just preliminary consultations and indicated that the process of negotiating a new agreement, should one be needed at all, might take several months.
"With things unraveling in Argentina, it appears that both sides decided they had no time to waste," a diplomat here said this weekend. "Any delay was only going to feed uncertainty in the markets and make things worse."
The sudden announcement of the standby credit line for Brazil was not the only move the monetary fund made on Friday in an effort to calm markets. 
The fund also said it would lend $1.5 billion to Turkey, another developing country that has been shaken by economic woes, and accelerate a $1.2 billion disbursement to Argentina. But it offered no additional money to supplement the $40 billion package that Argentina negotiated with international lenders late last year.
In Buenos Aires, John Taylor, the United States under secretary of the Treasury, held two days of talks with Argentine officials late last week. Argentine officials said afterward that the Bush administration understood the nation's financial problems and supported austerity moves to trim the deficit by at least $1.5 billion this year.
Officials also told local newspapers that they were confident that the United States and other economic powers would agree that I.M.F. payments to Argentina would be accelerated to assure that it could meet its debt obligations for the months to come.
Though much is made of the contagion effect of the Argentine crisis, Brazil trades much more with Europe and the United States than it does with Argentina or its other partners in Mercosur, the South American common market. 
In recent years, with the world economy booming, Brazil has received as much as $30 billion in new foreign investment annually. Even more than the funds obtained in the 1998 rescue package, that money has helped Brazil reduce its current account deficit and meet the targets that it promised the monetary fund it would fulfill.
During the first half of this year, in contrast, Brazil received only $9.9 billion in direct foreign investment, according to Central Bank statistics, compared with $13.4 billion during the first half of last year. 
The Brazilian government has already reduced its estimates of such capital inflows for this year, from $24 billion to $20 billion, but it may be forced to lower them even further if the United States and Europe plunge into recession or their nervousness about Argentina continues.
In recognition of that situation, the bulk of the package from the monetary fund consists of a $12.5 billion "supplementary reserve facility" that the fund's statement described as a purely "precautionary" measure. Officials indicated this weekend that the money would be used only if Brazil encountered problems in its balance of payments this year or next, after which the new accord is scheduled to expire.
Reaction to the agreement has been muted here so far, in large part because no one outside the government knows the terms of the accord yet. The announcement of whatever new commitments Brazil has made to hold the public deficit and inflation in check is expected to come this week, but everything points toward continued austerity.
With the country heading into a presidential election year, any additional cuts in government spending and investment would probably strengthen the appeal of the left-leaning opposition, some parts of which are opposed to dealings with the monetary fund and support a moratorium on repayment of Brazil's foreign debt.
In addition, Brazil's 170 million people have been living with rationing of electricity since June as the result of a drought and lack of investment in energy production. 
The government has promised an expensive crash program to build new dams and power plants, but Brazilian newspapers this weekend have been asking whether the government will still be able to meet those commitments.
Nor does the latest loan "alter the structural and fiscal weakness from the recession that is unveiling itself" here, the daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted in an editorial published on Saturday. "If I.M.F. support is seen as a necessary condition to avoid a deeper crisis, then this support is far from being sufficient."

HEADLINE: Putting Her Money Where Maine's Woods Are 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WINTER HARBOR, Me. 

 BODY:
Roxanne Quimby was too excited to steer. Her minivan meandered along the road in Acadia National Park, her knees bracing the wheel as she waved to park rangers or pointed out shoreline rocks where seals sometimes bask. She feels something spiritual in parks like this, she said.
 "I do hug trees," Ms. Quimby said. 
 In some ways, Ms. Quimby is like any naturalist enjoying a park; she just happens to be a very rich one. And that is what frightens some Maine residents. 
Since co-founding the natural skin care products company Burt's Bees in 1984, Ms. Quimby says, she has turned a profit large enough to allow her to start giving back to the earth. So she has been buying chunks of Maine's North Woods, which she hopes will one day be included in a new national park.
She bought 5,800 acres of forestland near Baxter State Park for $1.63 million; 2,350 acres near the Appalachian Trail for $570,000; 285 acres encompassing Little Greenwood Pond for $375,000; and 77 acres at the base of Mount Kineo for $350,000. She has a $2.2 million land deal in the works. Since news of her shopping spree became public in July, she has become a popular topic on the opinion pages of local newspapers.
To some she is a hero, a reincarnation of Percival Baxter, the wealthy governor who bequeathed to Maine what is now Baxter State Park. To others, she might as well be a flatlander for all the respect she shows for Maine's heritage as a lumber producer. 
"Message from northern Maine to Quimby: Leave us and our way of life alone," Eugene J. Conlogue, the town manager for Millinocket, wrote in a letter to The Bangor Daily News. "We don't want your park or your unfortunate, inaccurate and unfair depictions of the hard-working people of our part of the state."
The controversy over that park began a few years ago, when the paper companies that own much of Maine's forests began putting millions of acres on the market. Restore the North Woods, a conservation group, proposed turning 3.2 million of those acres in the northern central part of the state into a national park. 
But many people who live near the proposed park area say it would irreparably change the economy of the region, driving out the paper products industry and the jobs that go with it. Several communities in northern Maine have passed resolutions opposing the park, and the state's Congressional delegation and governor have spoken against the idea as well.
That does not discourage Ms. Quimby, a member of Restore's board of directors, who points out that people initially fought Grand Teton and several other national parks.
"They talk about the economy as if there were something at stake," she said. "It's the shakiest and most fragile economy I have ever seen."
Ms. Quimby, 51, has scrutinized Maine's rural economy as a company president and as a single mother who worked three part-time waitress jobs. She came to Maine when she was 24, not long out of the San Francisco Art Institute. With $3,000 in savings she bought 30 acres of land and built a cabin with her future husband. For several years the two of them lived without electricity, hauling their own water, growing their own food, and, when their twins were born, watching diapers freeze on the clothesline.
She and her husband eventually split, and as her children grew, she knew that her income from making Christmas wreaths and other crafts would not pay for college. She traded at flea markets and waited on tables to make ends meet.
Then she met Burt Shavitz, a beekeeper. Mr. Shavitz had been selling his honey in bulk, but Ms. Quimby figured it would be far more profitable to sell it in small jars with decorative labels. 
"He said, 'Go for it, Roxy, and by the way, I've got 2,000 pounds of beeswax in the shed,' " Ms. Quimby recalled. 
She turned the beeswax into candles, and later lip balm, hand salve and other skin care products that were sold under the Burt's Bees label. By 1993, the company had grown too big to operate profitably in northern Maine, so they moved it to North Carolina. But two years later she was back. She settled in quiet Winter Harbor, just steps from Schoodic Point, a less-visited peninsula in Acadia National Park.
Having bought out Mr. Shavitz, Ms. Quimby is now sole owner of Burt's Bees, which had revenues of $23 million last year and expects around $32 million this year. She runs the company from her home, with regular trips to the offices in Durham, N.C.
Ms. Quimby says she is ready to put every cent she has into buying land. Even then, says Jym St. Pierre, Maine director for Restore the North Woods, she will not be able to buy all the land needed for the park, but she sets an example for others.
"I look at these as seeds; these are the seeds around which we'll be able to grow a pearl," Mr. St. Pierre said. 
Ms. Quimby does not mind being the sand in the oyster. Every day she stops by the bakery run by her children to read the newspaper and find out what her neighbors are saying about her.
What they say is that they will be left to run motels and join the tourist trade. When Ms. Quimby says earnestly that "half of them would make excellent tour guides," they wince. 
Whether or not the park becomes a reality, she says, she hopes her legacy will have more to do with trees than with beeswax, "I don't think people will be saying, 'She created really great carrot cream -- three cheers for her!' "

HEADLINE: Bare-Bones Budgeting 

 BODY:
In its 17 straight years of failing to pass a budget on time, the State Legislature has shown remarkable creativity in finding new methods of avoidance. Last week, in a burst of ingenuity, it approved something called a "bare-bones budget." It's a creation that lies somewhere between a real budget and an emergency appropriation, a package with just enough money to keep the state idling along at minimal speed until mid-September, when everybody may be in the mood to try again. 
 The budget cuts all extras, including not only the Legislature's pet projects but most of the governor's as well. Environmental initiatives and economic development would come to a screeching halt. Some programs to help welfare recipients get work would run out of money for new clients in the fall, and local schools would receive far less state aid than they had been hoping for. 
 The view from the floors of the State Assembly and Senate is that this emaciated budget was necessary for one key reason -- it had to be ugly enough to force Gov. George Pataki and his people to the conference committee tables to negotiate a full-blown budget this fiscal year.
The governor's staff argues loudly that there were less lofty motives, namely paychecks and the August vacations. Legislators' pay has been held hostage since the budget missed its April 1 deadline. Once a budget is passed -- and State Comptroller Carl McCall decreed that had been done as of Friday -- the backlog of checks can be distributed. Overdue vacations also loomed large on the legislative horizon. Members of the Assembly and Senate have been marching sullenly to Albany a day or two a week all summer. Now, despite protests of school leaders, civic groups and some of their own leaders, many suddenly flush lawmakers plan to head for the hills -- or seashore.
The budget process is back where it should have been in February -- with the governor and legislators arguing about the bottom line. Given the economic slowdown that could cut revenues, it is clear that the governor is correct to say that the Assembly Democrats propose spending too much money for fiscal safety. But Mr. Pataki's schedule of tax cuts, enacted in better times, is also beginning to make too much of a dent in the revenue projections. 
Schools face the worst problems from Albany's budget swamp, particularly in poorer upstate areas and urban districts like New York City's. This skimpy new budget, which sticks close to Governor Pataki's proposed operating aid for schools, falls far short of what is needed in these districts, which are struggling to keep up with new state standards. 
To assess blame for the latest budget sump in Albany is, of course, a futile exercise, since there is now so much of it to go around. But the Legislature should not be leaving town, and the governor needs to spend more time in the Capitol overseeing his share of the budget process, even if it means all parties have to cancel their fund-raising trips or summer cruises. Some critics have suggested locking everyone in an open-air arena until there is a reasonable budget. What seemed like an outlandish idea a few months ago is beginning to sound like a workable option.

Arab With Rifle Wounds 10 At Israeli Defense Ministry
A Palestinian man stepped out of a car and sprayed automatic rifle fire outside the Israeli Defense Ministry, wounding 10 people, most of them soldiers on their lunch break. The gunman was shot in the head and killed by a traffic policeman as he tried to get away. Earlier, the Israeli army fired missiles at a car in the West Bank city of Tulkarm, killing an Islamic militant accused of anti-Israel terrorism. A1

Ehud Barak, Israel's former prime minister, said it was time for Israel and other countries to get tougher with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, by "isolating" him. Mr. Barak also challenged recent accounts of last year's Camp David negotiations, which say that the blame for their failure should not be solely on Mr. Arafat. A3

Hope Fading in Sri Lanka
Recent events in Sri Lanka, where almost two decades of warfare have sent hundreds of thousands of people fleeing for their lives, have stirred a menacing sense of foreboding. An effort to restore peace talks has gone nowhere, the country has plunged into political turmoil and a rebel attack on the country's international airport seemed to complete a collapse into despair. A1

Effort to Resolve Iran Impasse
Iran's top arbitration body scheduled an emergency meeting for today in an attempt to resolve a potential constitutional crisis over the swearing-in of President Mohammad Khatami for a second term. A3

Brazilians Uneasy Despite Help
Financial analysts predicted that the $15 billion in loans the International Monetary Fund offered Brazil on Friday will fall short of plans to deflect the economic troubles of neighboring Argentina. They believe overcoming the effects of economic slowdowns in the United States and Europe, rather than in Argentina, is Brazil's biggest challenge. A7

Bosnians Return for a Burial
Hundreds of Bosnian Muslims made a rare visit to Visegrad, a town in eastern Bosnia, to bury 152 members of their families believed to have been killed by Serbs in the Bosnian war. Community officials hoped the heavily guarded ceremony might speed the return of refugees. The dead had been exhumed over the last year from several mass and individual graves in the area. (Reuters)

Higher Standards of Living Are Shown in Census Data
American standards of living increased markedly throughout most of the country in the 1990's, bringing gains in education, housing and mobility along with higher incomes, comprehensive new census data shows. But if people's homes are bigger, so are their mortgages, and if they own more cars, they also commute more hours to work. A1

Tropical Storm Barry, nearing wind speeds that almost made it the season's first hurricane, aimed toward the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama, carrying the threat of torrential rains and weeks of flooding. A8

A New Nader Movement
Ralph Nader kicked off a "grass-roots movement" that he calls Democracy Rising with a rally Saturday in Portland, Ore. Though Mr. Nader made virtually no mention of presidential campaigns past or future in his speech and said the rally was "not a political or Green Party event," he remained unrepentant at a news conference about any corollary effects of his candidacy last year.

Jury Awards in Line With Judges'
A study of nearly 9,000 trials across the country has found that judges award punitive damages about as often as juries and generally in about the same proportions. A9

Freeh Was Spared Censure
An internal Justice Department inquiry recommended that Louis J. Freeh, the former F.B.I. director, and three other officials be censured for managerial failures during follow-up investigations of the deadly standoff at Ruby Ridge in Idaho in 1992, but Justice officials rejected any disciplinary action, government lawyers said.

HEADLINE: CENSUS DATA SHOW A SHARP INCREASE IN LIVING STANDARD 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5 

 BODY:
American standards of living increased markedly throughout most of the country in the 1990's, bringing gains in education, housing and mobility along with higher incomes, according to comprehensive new census data being released on Monday.
 But if people's homes are bigger, so are their mortgages, and if they own more cars, they also commute more hours to work, the new survey shows. "It's the American dream updated," said Robert E. Lang, an urban analyst with the Fannie Mae Foundation, an independent research organization. 
 And the survey provides the latest evidence that the magnet of readily available jobs is attracting immigrants at an ever faster pace. About 44 percent of the nation's 30.5 million foreign-born residents, or 13.3 million people, arrived here in the 1990's. Immigrants make up 11 percent of the country's population, the largest share since the 1930's, and nearly one in five Americans does not speak English at home. 
Much of the nation's wealth is still concentrated in the Northeast, but that region lost some of its edge in the decade as jobs and people migrated to fast-growing, economically vibrant areas like the Southeast and the West. 
It is no surprise, of course, that the latter half of the 1990's in particular was a boom time. But these new figures provide fresh details about the pinpoints of prosperity, especially useful to government planners and businesses because they are available a year earlier than usual after a decennial census. And they show the pockets of impoverishment where governments are struggling to provide services for the needy.
These are among the highlights: 
*More than two million grandparents are rearing their grandchildren, the first time the Census Bureau has kept track of that statistic.
*In 2000, 82 percent of people 25 and older had graduated from high school and 25 percent had at least a bachelor's degree. In 1990, the figures were 75 percent and 20 percent, respectively.
*More than 90 percent of households owned a car, van or truck in 2000, the highest share ever, and 18 percent owned three or more vehicles. Seventy-six percent of workers drove to work alone, up 3 percent from 1990. People are spending more time driving to work, often from rural settings where better-paying jobs are scarce. West Virginians logged the largest increase, to an average of 25.5 minutes each way in 2000 from 21 minutes in 1990, as jobs in the Washington suburbs beckoned. More than four million people worked at home in 2000, a sharp increase over a decade ago.
*The incomes of families grew and so did their homes, as more than one in four homes has seven rooms or more, up slightly from 1990. This confirms data showing that nearly one of five new houses exceeds 3,000 square feet. In 2000, the median monthly mortgage was $1,307, much higher than a decade ago. 
In a preview of official 2000 census data to be issued next year from the questionnaire known as the long form, the Census Bureau on Monday will release these and other results of a test survey of 700,000 households conducted simultaneously with the decennial head count.
Census officials want to replace the detailed long form, which yields important demographic and socioeconomic figures once a decade, with an annual survey that would provide similar information every year. In effect, it would be a rolling annual census, but a statistical sample rather than a comprehensive count. 
Both questionnaires are designed to measure education, housing, population and commuting characteristics, information that is used by the federal, state and local governments in an array of activities, including planning environmental protections, building roads, and developing health care programs for the elderly.
The survey shows that in 2000, New York became the first state where residents commuted more than 30 minutes on average each way to their jobs. Reflecting population shifts in the West, nearly one in four Nevadans lived in a different residence in 2000 than in 1999. Thirty-five percent of adults in Massachusetts had at least a four-year college degree. And 40 percent of Californians spoke a language other than English at home.
The Census Bureau is asking Congress to make this new method permanent, which would represent perhaps the biggest shift in the federal gathering of statistics since sampling techniques were introduced in the 1940 census. With some lawmakers worried that the new approach might duplicate other surveys or violate citizens' privacy by asking new questions, census officials and their allies hope this kind of useful detail will help them sell the idea.
A yearly survey would "enable local government decision makers to remove some of the guesswork and insert hard evidence into their decision-making process," Barbara Welty, the clerk of Kathio Township, Minn., told the House subcommittee on the census in June. 
J. Gregory Williams, the Alaska state demographer, said the new approach would help Alaska officials track the impact of military base closings, assess the impact of floods and other natural disasters, and monitor the social consequences of the volatile logging, mining and fishing industries.
If approved, the new annual sampling, called the American Community Survey, would by 2004 begin producing yearly estimates for geographic areas and population groups of 65,000 or more. Estimates for smaller areas would be available by 2008. Official population counts would continue to come from the shorter census form that all households are required by law to complete every 10 years.
The data to be released have limitations. The survey included only residential households and excluded troops in military barracks, students in college dormitories and people in other group quarters. Many characteristics, like income and poverty statistics, are not directly comparable to similar data from the 1990 or 2000 counts. 
For example, nearly 48 percent of Hispanics responding to the 2000 Census identified themselves as white and 42 percent said they were "some other race." In the test survey, which used highly trained enumerators to follow up with households that did not respond by mail, 63 percent of Hispanics identified themselves as white and 29 percent said they were "some other race."
"It certainly means we need more information about how Latinos are viewing race and what it means about how the census collects that information," said Sonia M. Perez, a demographer with the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group.
That said, demographers who reviewed the test survey results before their public release said they discovered intriguing trends about the nation's standards of living. 
There are still troubling signs from the test survey of groups being left behind. Nearly 13 percent of the country was living in poverty in 2000, down slightly from 1990 levels that are not strictly comparable. Among the poor are 17 percent of children under 18 and 11 percent of adults 65 or older. Seventeen percent of households received some sort of public assistance. About 530,000 homes lacked plumbing and 3.2 million households did not have telephone service, although both figures represent sharp declines from 1990 levels. 
In a surprising development to demographers that may reflect housing shortages in the booming economy or more profound changes in the nuclear family, 42 percent of grandparents living in the same house as their grandchildren were responsible for the youngsters. More than one-third of those two million grandparents had been taking care of the grandchildren for five or more years.
"In terms of looking at family situations," said Martin O'Connell, chief of the Census Bureau's fertility and family statistics branch, "this shows that we have to extend our horizons beyond Mother and Dad."
Over all, though, the test survey results show a prosperity that is shifting geographically. Eight of the 20 states with median household incomes above the national average of $41,343 in 2000 were in the Northeast. New Jersey ranked first with $54,226, edging out Connecticut, with $53,108. 
Wendell Primus, director of income security at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a research group, noted that a swath of Northeastern states from Maryland to Vermont lost ground over the decade in household income. 
The booming economy attracted many new immigrants, who arrived lawfully and unlawfully. Jeffrey S. Passel, a demographer with the Urban Institute, a social policy research group, said the test survey results supported his estimates that eight million to nine million immigrants now live illegally in the United States, including 4.5 million to 5 million Mexicans. The figures for both categories are about 1.5 million more than the Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates.
Reflecting this new diversity, 18 percent of all residents who were at least 5 years old spoke a language other than English at home, up 4 percent from 1990. Of those people, 60 percent spoke Spanish, and 43 percent reported that they did not speak English "very well." 
Immigrants are also dispersing across the country, as earlier census figures had shown. According to William H. Frey, a demographer at the University of Michigan, the populations of 27 states are now at least 5 percent foreign-born, compared with 14 states in 1980. States with large populations of new immigrants tended to ride the economic upswing. In a dozen states, including Nevada, more than half the population was born in other states or overseas, Mr. Frey said. Those states tend to have younger age structures and are more economically vibrant. Conversely, he said, those states with large proportions of residents who were born in the state, like Louisiana and Pennsylvania, have fewer migrants and have been economically stagnant for decades.
In another measure of mobility, about 15 percent of the population lived in a different residence in 2000 than the previous year. In five Western states -- Nevada, Alaska, Oregon, Colorado and Arizona -- more than 20 percent of residents had moved within the year, reflecting overall growth as well as transient college and military populations.
As the economy thrived, the nation's average commuting time to work increased to 24.3 minutes in 2000, from 22.4 minutes in 1990 and 21.7 minutes in 1980. (The 2000 figures are slightly inflated because of a difference in counting methods, but they still show that Americans are spending more time in their cars.) In 2000, 14.6 percent of workers 16 or older had commutes of more than 45 minutes, compared with 12.5 percent of commuters a decade ago.
"The trick with these numbers is that you don't know whether the same trip is taking longer or people are taking longer trips," said Alan E. Pisarski, a transportation specialist in Falls Church, Va., and author of "Commuting in America." "It's very likely a little bit of both."
Car-pooling continued to decline, to 11 percent from 13 percent in 1990, while use of public transportation to get to work hovered just above 5 percent, unchanged from 1990.

Bell Companies Are Blamed For the Slow Start Of a Fast Internet Service

BYLINE:  By KATIE HAFNER 

 BODY:
A year ago, Hossein Farmani, president of aNet Communications, a small Internet service provider in Los Angeles, catered to a loyal group of longtime customers. ANet was no AOL, but Mr. Farmani was content to preside over a small community of 5,000 or so users.
 Yet the customer loyalty proved to be highly elastic. Mr. Farmani discovered that providing competitively priced D.S.L. service -- a form of high-speed Internet connection -- had become close to impossible. Lured by lower prices to Pacific Bell Internet, the big telephone company's own Internet unit, half of Mr. Farmani's customers had deserted aNet. 
 "In a year or so, we won't have any customers at all," Mr. Farmani said. He added he could not lower his prices to match Pacific Bell's because of the high fees the telephone company charged him to connect his own D.S.L. customers to the network. Unlike some rates that telephone companies charge, fees for D.S.L. connections are typically not regulated. 
Small Internet service providers like aNet represent the last vestige of the Internet's original homespun character. Yet the aNets of the world are struggling, and many of them blame the regional Bell operating companies for their endangered status.
If it were simply a matter of the giant telephone companies' using their greater economies of scale to provide better, more affordable high-speed Internet service, the issue might be nothing more than a poignant tale of a declining mom-and-pop industry. But many business and consumers complain that D.S.L. remains too costly and too difficult to obtain simply to cede the field to the Bell companies. 
So far, according to the Yankee Group, a research firm, fewer than three million American households have D.S.L., a fraction of the households with slower-speed Internet access.
"Being the local-loop carrier puts the Bells in a monopolistic situation," said Zeus Kerravala, a Yankee Group analyst. "They have deep pockets and strong market share and can wait out any economic downturn. So they make promises they have no intention of keeping."
Mr. Farmani, for his part, is one of hundreds of Internet service providers across the country who have become increasingly disgruntled with the regional Bells. The service providers say the big phone companies unfairly use their market dominance and control of the local phone networks to make it difficult for them to provide D.S.L., or digital subscriber line, service. 
Although D.S.L. signals travel over regular phone wires, the service requires installation of a special modem for the customer's computer and requires third-party providers to place special equipment at or near the phone company's central office -- or to buy such connections from the phone company. The connection fees the phone companies charge service providers, as well as the degree of cooperation that phone companies extend to the providers, have a big impact on how effectively the outside providers can compete with the phone companies' own Internet services.
Last month, a group of California Internet service providers that included aNet complained to state regulators that Pacific Bell was using its network dominance to create a monopoly in D.S.L. service. 
The group's grievance has not been the only one. In April, after a complaint by a local Internet company, the Kentucky Public Service Commission ordered BellSouth to lower its D.S.L. rates to smaller Internet service providers. Dozens of similar complaints have found their way to regulators in other states and to the Federal Communications Commission.
The California complaint came after months of discussions with Pacific Bell and its owner, SBC Communications, said David Simpson, a lawyer representing the Internet service providers. 
"We brought I.S.P.'s from hither and yon to meet and talk with them in good faith about dozens of problems we wanted to solve, and it turned out to be a complete waste of time," Mr. Simpson said. 
Mr. Farmani and others say that pricing is one of the biggest problems. 
A Pacific Bell affiliate, SBC ASI, sells its D.S.L. lines to aNet at $30 a connection. To break even, many I.S.P.'s must charge at least $60 a month. With such an advantage, Pacific Bell Internet was recently able to raise its own customer rates for residential D.S.L. service by $10 a month to $49.95.
"It's like 'let us shoot ourselves in the head, please,' " said Dane Jasper, owner of Sonic.net, an Internet provider in Santa Rosa, Calif. "This is draconian. They'll get away with whatever they can get away with for as long as they can, until someone makes them stop."
Mr. Jasper, who joined in the complaint to the California commission and is considering further legal action, said he had lost hundreds of customers to Pacific Bell.
Joe Izbrand, an SBC spokesman, said the issues could be resolved without regulators' intervention. "We intend to continue working closely with I.S.P.'s who resell our D.S.L. service," Mr. Izbrand said.
According to a paper released last month by the School of Information Management and Systems at the University of California at Berkeley, the regional Bell operating companies control 90 percent of the residential D.S.L. market nationwide. The paper concludes that the nation's Bell companies have maintained "unreasonable delays" in providing D.S.L. connections to Internet service providers while charging wholesale prices that are "unjustifiably high."
A network equipment company, 3Com, formerly sold consumer D.S.L. modems, but stopped making the devices because the business was growing too slow. 
Bruce L. Claflin, 3Com's president and chief executive, said he believed there was latent demand for D.S.L. among consumers but that "the service providers are insufficiently able to capture the demand." 
The phone companies have been reluctant to make a big push into D.S.L., Mr. Claflin said, because the profit margins have not looked attractive enough. At the same time, he said, the phone companies have little incentive to make it easy for others to build D.S.L. businesses. 
In New York, Bway.net is an Internet service provider that says it has received too little cooperation from the region's Bell company, Verizon Communications. 
When possible, said Joe Plotkin, director of D.S.L. marketing for Bway.net, the company avoids Verizon, choosing instead to resell D.S.L. service from companies like Covad Communications that compete with the regional Bells in the D.S.L. business. Still, Covad and other third-party suppliers rely on Verizon for the physical connections and, Mr. Plotkin said, Verizon has repeatedly delayed installing them.
"We've had Verizon installers not show up on a specific appointment date, and we've had them claim there was no access to the client -- in the middle of the business day," Mr. Plotkin said. "What are the clients doing? Hiding under their desks?
"They've taken their monopoly advantage and leveraged it to get 80 percent of the market in D.S.L.," Mr. Plotkin said of the Bells. "It's not what the 1996 Telecommunications Act was supposed to do."
That law required the Bell companies to provide direct competitors like Covad with equal access to their network equipment for delivering a D.S.L. connection to a customer's premises. But Mr. Kerravala of the Yankee Group said the Bells had repeatedly delayed installation of lines. "They drag their heels when they're not the primary company selling the service," he said.
Eric Rabe, a Verizon spokesman, countered the critics. "I'd say we treat these people as customers," he said, "and we're doing our best to serve them." 
Of prices, Mr. Rabe said: "Certainly any customer would like to buy what they're buying at a lower rate. But the fact is that D.S.L. is an expensive technology. Verizon has spent $1 billion in the last couple of years to provide D.S.L. service to our customers."
Where true competition seems to exist for high-speed Internet access is not between the Bells and other D.S.L. providers. Instead, it is between D.S.L. technology and a type of high-speed access provided by the cable television companies via cable modems. Although the number of cable modem subscribers remains fairly low, the technology is more popular than D.S.L., in part because it has been in place longer and in part because there are fewer technical hurdles involved in providing cable modem service. There were 4.7 million residential cable modem subscribers at end of this year's first quarter -- compared with only 2.2 million residential D.S.L. subscribers -- according to the Yankee Group.
"We should be their foot soldiers, going in and getting D.S.L. customers for them so they can compete against the cable companies," Mr. Farmani said of the Bell companies. "But they treat us so badly we are encouraging our clients to sign up with the cable companies rather than the phone company's D.S.L."
Many customers, meanwhile, are expressing frustration over spotty D.S.L. service and inferior technical support from the phone companies. 
One disgruntled customer is Jason Greene, a Web-site content manager who works from his home in Boulder, Colo. Highly dependent on speedy access, Mr. Greene got his first D.S.L. connection nearly three years ago. Qwest Communications International, his regional Bell company, supplied the line, and Peak to Peak Internet, a service provider in Boulder, supplied his Internet service.
"I knew when I signed on that it wouldn't be a perfect service," Mr. Greene said. Little did he foresee, however, just how imperfect the setup might be. 
"One day it went down and didn't go up," Mr. Greene recalled. In that instance, Mr. Greene was without service for nearly two weeks. Even when the link was restored, for several months after, his D.S.L. connection periodically continued to fail.
"I had no other option on my phone line if I wanted a high-speed connection," he said. "No one else could give me D.S.L. service."
That changed a few months ago when Mr. Greene heard that cable modem service was available for $45 a month through his local cable provider, AT&T. Now he has both kinds of connections, having kept the $85-a-month D.S.L. service because, he said, it is much faster than the cable modem for uploading large files.
In Los Angeles, meantime, Mr. Farmani of aNet has all but acknowledged defeat. He plans to shift his focus to operating Web sites for clients -- even if he is not sanguine about his business prospects. "Web-site hosting is a very, very tough market," he said. But it is not as tough as D.S.L.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
In another telecommunications dispute, this time in Brazil, the new owners for Telecom Italia may need to settle a fight.

BYLINE:  By Jennifer L. Rich 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil 

 BODY:
ON one point, almost everyone agrees: it can't get any worse. 
 Or at least that is what industry experts here say about the relationship between Telecom Italia and a Brazilian investment bank, Grupo Opportunity, partners in one of the largest fixed-line telephone companies in the country, Brasil Telecom. 
With the purchase in late July of Telecom Italia by the Pirelli and Benetton groups of Italy, company officials are hoping to put to an end an acrimonious shareholder squabble -- a fight that has threatened the future of Brasil Telecom and Telecom Italia's plan to start building a wireless network throughout Brazil in 2002. 
With communications companies in Europe still bemoaning the billions they spent on wireless spectrum auctions, and American companies still sorting out the effects of the telecommunications meltdown, Telecom Italia's experience in Brazil demonstrates that telecommunications remorse knows no borders. 
Telecom Italia, through its Brazilian subsidiary, refused to comment on the possibility of changes in its Brazilian strategy until after a review of the Pirelli takeover by European regulators, which is expected to be completed in September. The Italian company also refused to discuss its rocky relationship with Grupo Opportunity. 
Luis Octavio da Motta Veiga, the chairman of Brasil Telecom, represents the interests of Opportunity. He says that relations started to sour between the partners soon after Telecom Italia was taken over in June 1999 by the Olivetti group, headed by Roberto Colaninno.
"Those guys in Italy weren't easy; it can only be good for the company that they are gone," Mr. Motta Veiga said. "Good or bad, Pirelli is a multinational company that has to have practices that are more conventional that those of Colaninno and his group."
But Opportunity and Telecom Italia were unlikely partners from the start, back in 1998, when they agreed to bid jointly on assets in Brazil's privatization of the state-owned telephone system, Telebras.
"They came together as partners somewhat by default during the privatization," said Tucker Grinnan, a Latin America analyst at Deutsche Bank. "They weren't necessarily each other's first choice."
Partnerships were forming quickly though, and at that time, few multinational phone companies felt they could afford to sit out this dance -- the largest telecommunications privatization in Latin American. And Opportunity had lots of cash, controlling a multibillion-dollar investment fund made up of resources from Citigroup and Brazil's largest pension funds. 
The Telecom Italia-Opportunity group spent about $1 billion to win the concession for a block of nine telephone companies in the southern and west-central parts of the country; the resulting company became Brasil Telecom. Opportunity had a 62 percent stake and control the board; Telecom Italia got a 38 percent stake and veto power. 
Three years later, there are two major lawsuits pending. In the first, the Opportunity faction has accused Telecom Italia of conducting closed-door dealings the suit says have caused Brasil Telecom to overpay by more than $100 million for a stake in another local phone company. Telecom Italia has denied the accusations. 
In the meantime, Telecom Italia's wireless subsidiary, Telecom Italia Mobile, won three cellular telephone licenses that the Brazilian government auctioned in 2000. The Opportunity faction within Brasil Telecom filed a lawsuit accusing Telecom Italia of acting acted in bad faith by demanding financial restrictions that forced Brasil Telecom to withdraw from bidding for the same licenses. 
The fight continues. Under Brazilian regulations meant to keep the wire-line telephone network moving forward even as cellular systems are built, Telecom Italia will not be allowed to start its wireless service in January, as it had hoped, unless Brasil Telecom agreed to speed construction of the wired telephone network by a year. In a move that was largely considered spite, the Opportunity-controlled Brasil Telecom board recently approved a budget that would not enable it to complete the work a year early. 
Telecom Italia has vetoed that budget. If the deadlock is not resolved by October, the issue will go to arbitration. 
"Telecom Italia is in a very difficult position because in contrast to Opportunity, the clock is really ticking for them," Mr. Grinnan from Deutsche Bank said. "If they are not able to launch in a timely manner, it really raises questions about the viability of their Brazilian wireless strategy."
A spokesman for Brazil's telecommunications regulator, Anatel, said the agency was reviewing the rules for a loophole that would allow Telecom Italia to begin wireless operations regardless of Brazil Telecom's construction schedule. Otherwise, Anatel does not intend to grant an exception.
What's more, Anatel has also said that it would consider taking the licenses away from Telecom Italia if the differences with Opportunity are not resolved quickly. With no other buyers on the horizon, though, analysts doubt that the government would be willing to take that step.
Critics accuse Opportunity of using the disputes to try to force Telecom Italia to sell its stake in Brasil Telecom. But analysts hope that new management in Rome will achieve a detente in relations among the shareholders, so that some sort of agreement can be worked out to allow Telecom Italia to begin its Brazilian wireless operations next year. 
"For Telecom Italia, selling Brasil Telecom means losing a lot of money, since they paid much more for the company than it is worth now," said Alexandre Constantini, a Bear, Stearns analyst in Sao Paulo. "It is going to force Telecom Italia to come to some sort of understanding with Opportunity in the short term, in order to later make a decision whether to sell or buy Brasil Telecom." 
Many analysts agree that one of the partners will eventually have to leave. Shares in Brasil Telecom have been undervalued since the beginning of the dispute, they say, and minority shareholders will continue to be skeptical even if disagreements between the partners are resolved.
Opportunity, as it turns out, has an expanding caseload of disputes with its partners. The Brazilian pension funds have filed nearly two dozen lawsuits against the group under a variety of criticisms, including accusations that management fees are unreasonably high. There is also a continuing dispute with Telecommunication and Wireless of Canada, which is Opportunity's partner in two other cellular telephone assets in Brazil. 
"What we have to recognize," Mr. Constantini said, "is that no one is a saint here."

PERSON: Senator Robert C. Byrd 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Old Hand on a Collision Course With the White House

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
SENATOR Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia knows precisely what he will do with his $600 tax rebate check when it lands in the mailbox sometime in the next few weeks. He will place it carefully in an envelope -- and send it straight back to the United States Treasury.
 "They were very generous in handing this money out to me, and I'm going to be very generous in sending it back," said the 83-year-old chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, his tone equal parts sarcasm and bitter defiance. 
 "I can't be as vocal a critic as I've been of this stupid tax cut and then put the money in the pocket," he said. "I'm not doing this for show. I'll do it because I think I'd be a hypocrite otherwise." 
In what would otherwise be the twilight of one of the Senate's longest careers, Robert Carlyle Byrd -- the fiddle-playing son of a coal-miner, the self-taught Constitutional scholar and Thucydides-quoting historian, the legendary Senate power player and undisputed master of its rules -- finds himself girding for battle this fall with the White House.
"We don't hit much off," he said of his difficult relationship with the Bush administration. "I seldom hear from them. I do my work. They do theirs." He paused for effect then added, with understatement, "I guess at some point there may be some little bits of collision."
When the Democrats took control of the Senate this spring, Mr. Byrd was returned to the chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee. The perch allows him to determine which government agencies and programs are financed each year -- and which ones are not.
When he ran the committee for six years beginning in 1989, Mr. Byrd relished the job, arguably the most powerful post in the Senate apart from majority leader; the panel determines where the government steers billions of dollars in public works projects.
In his first stint as chairman, Mr. Byrd made certain that many of those dollars finished up in West Virginia for roads, water projects and government offices and laboratories. "I want to be West Virginia's billion-dollar industry," he vowed in 1990. 
What others described as wasteful pork-barrel spending, Mr. Byrd called an effort to help an impoverished coal-mining state that had been overlooked in the federal budget.
"I would think that I had been a miserable failure if the people of West Virginia had sent me to Washington and I never did anything to help them," he said. "The way my people look at it is this: They say for many years we didn't get anything. Now we're getting our fair share."
But now, with Washington facing a budget crunch that could mean the abrupt return of deficit spending, Mr. Byrd said he almost wished he had not taken the job again. "Sometimes, I have to tell you, I'd rather not be chairman," he said. "Having this title is a mere figment of what it was."
His plight should become more dire this month, when the government releases projections showing that the federal surplus will be much smaller than was forecast only a few weeks ago. 
The culprits for the fast-shrinking surplus: the faltering economy and the $1.3 trillion tax-cut package that President Bush pushed through Congress this spring and that Mr. Byrd so sharply opposed.
The squeeze would mean less money for Congressional appropriators to spend on home-state projects, and Mr. Byrd said he had been blunt with senators who have asked him for special appropriations for their states.
"I've already said to them that we don't have the money," he said. "The money isn't there because it's already committed by this huge tax cut. We stepped out on a limb and enacted a tax cut based on surpluses that were always very vulnerable."
THE situation has left Mr. Byrd in a sour mood, especially because he has reason to suspect that the White House will single him out for blame if the government's discretionary spending exceeds the $661 billion permitted under this year's budget. His committee is responsible for approving 13 spending bills before the end of the fiscal year next month.
The White House seems certain to attack him, he knows, if too much money appears to be headed to West Virginia, a prospect that makes him angry. "If I earmark something, it's because the people of West Virginia need it," he said, bouncing his index finger on a table. "Nobody from the White House can lecture me."
Mr. Byrd entered the Senate in 1959, when some of his current colleagues were in diapers, and he seems a lonely, fragile figure as he slowly walks the halls, many of his closest friends from the Senate either retired or dead.
He said he seriously considered retirement when his term came up last year. But after what he said were long, tearful conversations with Erma, his wife of 64 years, he decided that he had to run again if the remainder of his life was to have meaning. He won 78 percent of the vote. "I would probably be much better off to retire than to serve here; it's tremendous stress," he said. "But all I would have to look forward to is the tombstone."

HEADLINE: SATELLITE TV RIVAL IN BID FOR HUGHES 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
EchoStar, the nation's second-largest satellite television company, made a $30.4 billion unsolicited bid yesterday for its larger rival, Hughes Electronics, the owner of DirecTV. The offer is an effort to pre-empt the sale of Hughes to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which has been negotiating to buy the company for months.
 If EchoStar's bid succeeds, the deal would probably face tough scrutiny from regulators because EchoStar would then control more than 90 percent of satellite television services for the home in the United States. Indeed, Hughes and its parent, General Motors, privately spurned a buyout offer weeks earlier from EchoStar over worries that antitrust officials would block the deal, according to executives involved in the talks. 
 EchoStar, known to consumers through its Dish network, says that merging the companies, with more than 15 million subscribers combined, would give it the heft to better compete against a shrinking number of cable television operators.
Because Hughes is a G.M. division, EchoStar cannot carry out a direct offer to shareholders for control of the business. But by making its offer public, EchoStar is hoping that shareholders of G.M. and Hughes, which has its own publicly traded stock, will push for the rejection of the News Corporation's offer in favor of EchoStar's bid. The tactic is known as a bear hug.
"We wanted to go directly to the shareholders," Charles W. Ergen, EchoStar's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. "The economics are so compelling. We couldn't walk away."
EchoStar's bid comes just two days before a meeting of G.M.'s board scheduled for Tuesday, when it was expected to review the final preparations for its sale to the News Corporation, according to executives taking part in those negotiations.
G.M. has struggled to sell Hughes for nearly a year, originally hoping to get as much as $45 billion. But with only one strong suitor -- the News Corporation -- gaining that price has been difficult. G.M.'s effort has been hampered even more because the News Corporation can hardly afford to pay for the business, and has offered no premium to Hughes's current stock price.
EchoStar's latest offer represents an 18 percent premium over Hughes's stock price on Friday. It offered to exchange 0.75 EchoStar share -- worth about $22.83 -- for each share of Hughes, which trades as a tracking stock. A tracking stock reflects the performance of a specific part of a company's business but does not provide actual ownership. G.M. owns about 30 percent of the shares in Hughes but controls all of its assets.
The News Corporation's proposal is much more complex. It calls for the News Corporation to merge its satellite business -- the largest in the world -- with that of Hughes in a new company, creating a worldwide satellite television operation worth $50 billion, according to the executives taking part in the negotiations. While the News Corporation would own only about 35 percent of the combined company, it would have control. The Hughes shareholders would own more than half of the company -- making the sale tax-free for them -- but would have no control, the executives said.
Proponents of that deal suggest that the News Corporation, despite offering no premium, would give G.M. and Hughes shareholders benefits from putting the businesses together, an assertion that some shareholders and analysts regard as dubious.
"There's enough discontent among the shareholders that they could vote against a Murdoch deal," said Robert Kaimowitz, an analyst at SG Cowen.
Mr. Kaimowitz's firm had a study done on whether an EchoStar deal would be approved by regulators. "It's doable," he said. "They have to prove that consumers would benefit."
Some experts worry that combining EchoStar and Hughes would harm competition in rural markets that typically rely on satellite television services because cable television is unavailable.
Mr. Ergen answered that the combined company would be able to offer more local channels and that it would consider a nationwide pricing plan so that rural customers -- who often cost more to serve -- would pay the same as urban subscribers.
"There will be naysayers, but I'm confident there will be no regulatory problem," Mr. Ergen said. "We're still a relatively small fish in a big pond."
To advise on its strategy, his company has hired David Boies, who prosecuted the government's antitrust case against Microsoft, and Joel I. Klein, the Justice Department's former antitrust chief. 
Mr. Ergen said that the continuing consolidation of the cable television industry -- like Comcast's recent unsolicited bid for AT&T's cable business -- could create even more powerful competitors for his business.
A spokesman for G.M. said it would consider EchoStar's proposal, which it had not yet reviewed as of late yesterday. A spokesman for the News Corporation declined to comment.
In a letter to G.M. setting out EchoStar's proposal, Mr. Ergen stated that it would create $56 billion in savings through steps like reducing the cost of programming, lowering costs to attract new subscribers, and lowering administrative expenses.
An executive close to G.M. said the level of savings Mr. Ergen spoke of was "absurd." The executive said that G.M. was "more than open" to a deal with EchoStar, but that the antitrust hurdles were just too high. "We don't want to do the deal, spend 18 month waiting for approval only to be blocked, and then be back at square one again," the executive said.
Mr. Ergen appeared to abandon his pursuit of Hughes last month. But, with his stock up almost 34 percent this year, he may be able to outbid Mr. Murdoch.
Hughes, based in El Segundo, Calif., has 9.5 million subscribers, compared with slightly more than 6 million for EchoStar, based in Littleton, Colo. But analysts say that EchoStar has done better lately at signing up new subscribers.

HEADLINE: Free Trade and Mexican Trucking 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is rightly concerned about the nation's failure to comply with a provision of the North American Free Trade Agreement granting trucks from Mexico and the United States the right to deliver goods in each other's markets. Highway safety concerns and organized labor's protectionist pressure led the Clinton administration to delay granting Mexican trucks access beyond a 20-mile-deep border area. A Nafta arbitration panel ruled in February that the United States was in violation of its treaty obligations. Yet Congress is still seeking, ill-advisedly, to obstruct President Bush's plans to open the border by next year. 
 There is no reason why the United States cannot address legitimate safety issues and comply with its treaty obligations at the same time. The Teamsters union and some of its Congressional allies have grossly overblown the threat to American highway safety posed by an opening of the border. Mexico's long-haul trucking fleet is a lot more modern and its drivers are a lot more professional than the union's scare tactics would suggest. In any case, the trade agreement does not require a watering down of American regulations. The only serious unresolved issue is how to strengthen inspection requirements so that they can be effectively enforced against Mexican trucks. 
 The House of Representatives lamentably avoided that issue when it passed a transportation spending bill for 2002. The bill rejected the White House's request for funds to bolster safety inspections at the border, and instead opted for a continued ban on Mexican trucking. The Senate was more subtle. It passed a measure last week that imposes a battery of new discriminatory regulations on Mexican trucks so excessive and burdensome as to effectively prevent compliance with the treaty for a long time. This would needlessly damage America's relationship with Mexico at an especially promising moment.
Mr. Bush has threatened to veto the $60.1 billion transportation spending bill if the protectionist trucking provision survives a House-Senate conference. There is no principled reason for Democratic leaders to test his resolve. They should work with the administration to reach a compromise that champions highway safety without tying up vital spending for other transportation needs or jeopardizing the nation's credentials as a free trader. 
Senators John McCain and Phil Gramm have laid the groundwork for a compromise that should be acceptable to those genuinely concerned with matters of safety rather than simply scoring points with labor interests that are still fighting a rear-guard action against free trade. The senators want the federal government to carry out reasonable on-site safety reviews of companies in Mexico and to emulate California's successful inspection program, which requires that all Mexican trucks be thoroughly inspected at the border once every 90 days. Mexican trucks would still be treated differently from Canadian trucks, but the differences would be acceptable.
The free-trade agreement has tripled commerce between Mexico and the United States in less than a decade, undeniably benefiting both economies. Congressional Democrats should work with the White House to address highway safety concerns without undermining the free-trade agreement and America's relationship with Mexico.

HEADLINE: An Unrepentant Nader Unveils a New Grass-Roots Project 

BYLINE:  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Aug. 5 

 BODY:
"We've got to raise our expectation level, folks!" Ralph Nader shouted to a thunderous ovation here on Saturday night at what he billed as the first major rally to kick off a new "grass-roots movement" that he calls Democracy Rising. "We've got to raise our expectations! 
 "Our elections are not for sale!" said Mr. Nader, applause from the crowd of 7,500 people nearly drowning him out. "Our democracy is not for sale! Our government is not for sale! Our children are not for sale! Our environment, not for sale!" 
 Plenty of people may still be furious with Mr. Nader, believing that his Green Party presidential candidacy did little more than tip the 2000 election to George W. Bush. At least two dozen of them showed up outside Portland's professional basketball arena, the Rose Garden, to protest Mr. Nader's speech. 
They carried satirical placards, all depicting Mr. Nader, the 67-year-old consumer advocate, as a pawn and a dupe: "Right-wing freaks coalition for Nader." "Back-alley abortionists for Nader." "Defense contractors for Nader." "Citizens against tundra." "Unelectable at any speed." They handed out leaflets pleading with people going inside to persuade Mr. Nader not to run for president again, but instead to use his influence to move the Democratic Party to the left. 
But in the 20,000-seat arena, which was curtained off, giving the illusion of being packed, it was hard to find anyone with a negative word for Mr. Nader or his candidacy. Nearly all in attendance had paid $10 to hear him speak, and others contributed even more in the "democracyrising.org" cardboard boxes that were passed among the crowd. 
Though Mr. Nader made virtually no mention of presidential campaigns past or future in his 57-minute speech and declared that the rally was "not a political or Green Party event," he remained unrepentant at a news conference just before about any corollary effects of his candidacy last year. He reiterated that his sole regret was that he had not received more votes. (He got about 3 percent nationwide, ranging from 10 percent in Alaska down to zero in the five states where he was kept off the ballot.) 
Mr. Nader brushed aside a question about all those self-identified progressives who believe his campaign helped nudge Mr. Bush into the White House. These included protesters outside the arena like Marty Smith, 34, a Web site developer who said progressives should strive to be "that 'nutso,' must-placate faction of the Democratic Party in the same way the religious right is something the Republicans have to deal with," and those who took note of the Nader trip to Portland with a letter to the editor in The Oregonian, the state's biggest newspapers, urging him to "be an organizer and evangelizer, not a candidate." 
Mr. Nader snapped: "They're getting over it -- I mean, it takes a few months. I was under the impression that Al Gore won the election. I thought that's what they believe." He depicted his candidacy as having ultimately helped tip the Senate to Democratic control because, he said, Green Party voters were clearly a factor in the razor-thin victory of Maria Cantwell, the Democratic candidate in Washington state. 
In any event, he added: "All this talk really comes down to one issue. They don't think the Democrats should be challenged by any party of the progressive wing. They haven't been challenged since 1948, with the Henry Wallace progressive party. They've gotten used to not being challenged. They've gotten used to telling progressives they have no place to go." 
For a man who disdains professional politicians, Mr. Nader has gotten one trick of the trade down pat, the standard assertion that he is "not even thinking" about whether to run next time.
"I don't believe in long campaigns," he said, "it's far too early." 
And in his depiction, he never really wanted to run in the first place but saw no other choice. "I'm a civic advocate; I have been for 40 years," he said. "When the doors are closed on citizen groups in Washington, you've got to go into the political arena, but that's just a means to a broader strengthening of the citizenry. I read my Jefferson early." 
Mr. Nader said he was hoping that the Portland rally would be the first of several in big cities that were ultimately designed to spark a "million-hundred-hundred" movement of the citizenry: one million people devoting at least 100 hours a year and $100 to a variety of causes like economic and environmental justice, universal health care, campaign finance revisions, union organizing, solar energy and better public transportation. 
He received prolonged applause during an attack on genetic engineering. "The new slavery," he said, "is the ownership and control of the genetic inheritance of the world -- the flora, the fauna and the human genes." 
The "Nader Rocks the Rose Garden" Portland rally included speeches and singing by a variety of Green Party figures and professional entertainers like Danny Glover, Jello Biafra and Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam. Mr. Nader declared it all a big success. 
"You just have to ask yourself, is anyone else doing this, is anybody else bringing out thousands of people?" he said. "That's really the comparative measure. There's a lot of empty arenas in this country, built by taxpayer money, I might add, and they need to be filled."

HEADLINE: SCIENTIST AT WORK/Bjorn Lomborg; 
From an Unlikely Quarter, Eco-Optimism

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS WADE 

 BODY:
The news from environmental organizations is almost always bleak. The climate is out of whack. Insidious chemicals taint food and drink. Tropical forests are disappearing. Species are perishing en masse. Industrial poisons pollute air, earth and water. Ecosystems are being stressed to the breaking point by the greedy, wasteful consumption of the Western lifestyle and its would-be imitators.
 So it is a surprise to meet someone who calls himself an environmentalist but who asserts that things are getting better, that the rate of human population growth is past its peak, that agriculture is sustainable and pollution is ebbing, that forests are not disappearing, that there is no wholesale destruction of plant and animal species and that even global warming is not as serious as commonly portrayed. 
 Strange to say, the author of this happy thesis is not a steely-eyed economist at a conservative Washington think tank but a vegetarian, backpack-toting academic who was a member of Greenpeace for four years. He is Dr. Bjorn Lomborg, a 36-year-old political scientist and professor of statistics at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. Dr. Lomborg arrived at this position, much to his own astonishment, through a journey that began in a Los Angeles bookshop in February 1997. 
Dr. Lomborg was leafing through an issue of Wired magazine and started reading an interview with Dr. Julian L. Simon, a University of Maryland economist who argued in several books that population was unlikely to outrun natural resources.
But Dr. Simon, who died in 1998, is more widely known for his solution to the airline overbooking problem (having airlines pay passengers to take a later flight) and for a 1980 bet with Dr. Paul Ehrlich, president of Stanford University's Center for Conservation Biology. Dr. Lomborg bet that any five metals chosen by Dr. Ehrlich would be cheaper in 1990; Dr. Ehrlich lost on all five.
Dr. Lomborg felt sure that Dr. Simon's arguments were "simple American right-wing propaganda," though presented with enough seriousness that they would be worth rebutting. Back in Aarhus, he started nightly study sessions with his statistics students to debunk Dr. Simon's contentions, using figures drawn from reports of the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the International Panel on Climate Change and other gatherers of official facts.
"Three months into the project, we were convinced that we were being debunked instead," Dr. Lomborg said. "Not everything he said is right. He has a definite right-wing slant. But most of the important things were actually correct."
Dr. Lomborg has presented his findings in "The Skeptical Environmentalist," a book to be published in September by Cambridge University Press. The primary targets of the book, a substantial work of analysis with almost 3,000 footnotes, are statements made by environmental organizations like the Worldwatch Institute, the World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace. He refers to the persistently gloomy fare from these groups as the Litany, a collection of statements that he argues are exaggerations or outright myths.
Dr. Lomborg also chides journalists, saying they uncritically spread the Litany, and he accuses the public of an unfounded readiness to believe the worst.
"The Litany has pervaded the debate so deeply and so long," Dr. Lomborg writes, "that blatantly false claims can be made again and again, without any references, and yet still be believed." This is the fault not of academic environmental research, which is balanced and competent, he says, but rather of "the communication of environmental knowledge, which taps deeply into our doomsday beliefs."
To understand the world as it is, Dr. Lomborg says, it is necessary to look at long-term global trends that tell more of the whole story than short-term trends and are less easy to manipulate.
For example, the Worldwatch Institute, in its 1998 "State of the World" report, said, "The world's forest estate has declined significantly in both area and quality in recent decades." But the longest data series of annual figures available from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization shows that global forest cover has in fact increased, to 30.89 percent in 1994 from 30.04 percent of global land cover in 1950. The Worldwatch report goes on to claim that because of soaring demand for paper, "Canada is losing some 200,000 hectares of forest a year." The cited reference, however, says that "in fact Canada grew 174,600 more hectares of forest each year," Dr. Lomborg writes.
Janet Abramovitz, Worldwatch's forest expert, said the world forest cover had shrunk significantly in the last 20 years. She based that contention on a different, shorter series of Food and Agriculture Organization statistics but declined to cite a percentage. The institute's figure on Canadian forest loss was an error, she said.
In its report for 2000, the Worldwatch Institute cited the dangers it had foreseen in 1984 -- "record rates of population growth, soaring oil prices, debilitating levels of international debt and extensive damage to forests from the new phenomenon of acid rain" -- and lamented that "we are about to enter a new century having solved few of these problems."
But in his book, Dr. Lomborg cites figures from the United States Census Bureau, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Environment Agency to show that the rate of world population growth has actually been dropping sharply since 1964; the level of international debt decreased slightly from 1984 to 1999; the price of oil, adjusted for inflation, is half what it was in the early 1980's; and the sulfur emissions that generate acid rain (which has turned out to do little if any damage to forests, though some to lakes) have been cut substantially since 1984.
In an interview, the president of the Worldwatch Institute, Christopher Flavin, agreed that progress had been made in the four problems cited in the institute's 1984 report, but he said that had been mentioned in other institute reports. "If you read through our materials as a whole," Mr. Flavin said, "many of these improvements are acknowledged."
Dr. Lomborg has also been unable to find strong support in the official statistics for the regular predictions of disaster from Dr. Ehrlich. "In the course of the 1970's," Dr. Ehrlich wrote in "The Population Bomb," published in 1968, "the world will experience starvation of tragic proportions -- hundreds of millions of people will starve to death."
Although world population has doubled since 1961, Dr. Lomborg writes, calorie intake has increased by 24 percent as a whole and by 38 percent in developing countries.
Dr. Lomborg also takes issue with some global warming predictions. In assessing how waste gases could warm the world's climate, he says, there are four wild cards that affect the climate change models. 
One is the multiplier effect of carbon dioxide -- as it heats the atmosphere a little, the air can hold more water, and that heats the atmosphere a lot more. How much more is in question, but Dr. Lomborg cites satellite and weather balloon data that seem to weaken the case for a strong multiplier effect.
The other three wild cards, Dr. Lomborg says, are the role of clouds, the effect of aerosols and the effect of the sunspot cycle on earth's climate.
Dr. Lomborg believes that when it comes to computer models of climate change, the International Panel on Climate Change deals all four wild cards in a way that exaggerates the effect of greenhouse gases. This means, in his view, that the actual warming will be at the cooler end of the panel's predicted range.
He contends that the internationally agreed Kyoto targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions will impose vast costs for little result. A more effective approach, according to Dr. Lomborg, would be to increase research on alternative sources of energy, like solar and fusion.
But Dr. Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research said that new satellite data were likely to point toward a strong multiplier effect for carbon dioxide.
And while Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an expert on global warming at Environmental Defense, agrees that clouds and aerosols are still weak points in the climate models, he says Dr. Lomborg's contention on the effects of the sunspot cycle is not widely accepted. As to Dr. Lomborg's policy recommendations, Dr. Oppenheimer said that investing in technology alone was "like betting the farm on a policy in which we have less confidence than emissions reduction." In his view, a broad-based technology push would turn into a pork-barrel program and be far less efficient than the technology that would develop in response to a requirement to reduce emissions. 
"The Skeptical Environmentalist" portrays several other elements of the Litany as little more than urban myths. One is the prediction that the world's forests and a large number of species are headed for catastrophe.
Dr. Lomborg believes that forest loss has been less serious than is often described -- only 20 percent since the dawn of agriculture, not 67 percent, as stated by the World Wildlife Fund. He also puts the present annual rate of loss at 0.46 percent, as calculated by the Food and Agriculture Organization, rather than at 2 percent or more, the figure cited by many environmentalists.
Given that the forests are not doing that badly, he is skeptical of claims that the world is about to lose half or more of its species. The often quoted figure that 40,000 species are lost every year comes from a 1979 article by Dr. Norman Myers, an ecologist at Oxford University. But this figure, Dr. Lomborg says, was not based on any evidence, just on Dr. Myers's conjecture that one million species might be lost from 1975 to 2000, which works out to be 40,000 species a year.
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which maintains the Red Book of endangered species, concluded in 1992 that the extinction figures for mammals and birds were "very small" and that the total extinction rate, assuming 30 million species, was probably 2,300 species a year.
Nonetheless, Dr. Lomborg says, Dr. Myers repeated his estimate in 1999 with a warning that "we are into the opening stages of a human-caused biotic holocaust."
Dr. Myers confirmed in an interview that the figure of 40,000 extinctions a year had come from his estimate. He said that it was an illustration used to make his argument clear and that he gave figures only "when I am speaking to a political leader or policy maker who says that in order to sell his message, he absolutely must have some number."
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature's estimate was too low, Dr. Myers said, because it considered a species extinct only after none of its members had been sighted for 50 years. "All I am trying to do is to demonstrate that we are in the opening phase of a mass extinction," he said.
Though no longer a member of Greenpeace, Dr. Lomborg still counts himself as an environmentalist and portrays his critique as based on the outlook of a leftist. "I'm a left-wing guy," he says, "and a vegetarian because I don't want to kill animals -- you can't play the 'he's right-wing so he's wrong' argument." 
He believes that the environment must be protected and that regulation is often necessary. But exaggerating problems distorts society's priorities, he says, and makes it hard for society to make the best decisions.
Writing about environmentalists, he says, "The worse they can portray the environment, the easier it is for them to convince us that we need to spend more money on the environment rather than on hospitals, child day care, etc."
Those who abandon long-held faiths are often strident advocates of their new views. But Dr. Lomborg displays little of the convert's zeal. His aim is not to preach free-market solutions for every problem or to deny that threats to the environment exist.
His motive, he says, is simply to document that the facts, in his view, tell a far brighter story than the Litany. Thomas Malthus argued in 1798 that population growth was certain to outrun food supply. As Dr. Lomborg sees it, Malthus's gloomy predictions still hold an iron grip over many minds, and are still wrong.

HEADLINE: Women Now Look Beyond H.I.V., to Children and Grandchildren 

BYLINE:  By LINDA VILLAROSA 

 BODY:
Mindy Prager, a psychiatrist who turns 40 this year, is trying to have a baby. Like many other women who delayed pregnancy, she has several concerns.
 She wonders if she is too old to begin motherhood, if she is still fertile and if her boyfriend of four years is as committed to the idea as she is. But Dr. Prager also has other things on her mind. She will need artificial insemination to conceive, and if it works she will have to balance the needs of pregnancy with the handful of pills she needs every day to stay alive. Dr. Prager is H.I.V. positive. 
 "In the past, I never allowed myself to think about having a baby or even look at a baby. I was just waiting to die," said Dr. Prager, a New Yorker living in Istanbul, who was infected with H.I.V. 15 years ago after being pricked by a needle during her medical residency. "But now, everything has changed, and I suddenly have the opportunity to have a child." 
A few years ago it was almost unheard of for a woman who knew she was infected with H.I.V. to attempt to become pregnant. Most women who knew they were H.I.V. positive were not willing to risk the 25 percent chance they would have a child carrying the virus. But now, with a regimen of medication, an H.I.V.-positive woman can reduce the chance of infecting her child to almost zero.
Armed with this information, small but increasing numbers of H.I.V.-positive women are deciding to have children.
But even as they embrace motherhood, many worry about the uncertain future that comes with a life-threatening disease. They worry about their children's health as well as their own. Although a vast majority of the children are thriving, it is too soon to tell whether the powerful antiretroviral drugs the women took during pregnancy will have long-term effects on the children.
Experts say the reduction in mother-to-child transmission is one of the few success stories in the 20-year history of AIDS in America.
"As far as perinatal transmission, there has been a remarkable change over the last decade," said Dr. Howard Minkoff, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. "Over all, the risk of any American woman having a child with a major birth defect is 2 to 3 percent. In comparison, an H.I.V.-infected woman who does everything right can now be reasonably sure that there is a 99 percent chance that her baby will be born free of the virus."
Rebecca Denison, founder of an advocacy group for H.I.V.-positive women, said, "The number of women who I've talked to about having children has skyrocketed."
The group, Women Organized to Respond to Life Threatening Diseases, based in Oakland, Calif., is assisting about 40 pregnant women who are H.I.V. positive.
Ms. Denison, who is 39 and found out she was H.I.V. positive 10 years ago, is the mother of twin girls born in 1996. "In the old days there were a handful of us who would get together and talk about how much grief we had because we wanted to be mothers, but were positive and would never be able to have kids," she said. "Now most of us have either done it, are gathering information about it or trying to get the treatment regimens stable enough to get pregnant."
But, she continued, "Whether we will live to see our children grow up is something that we talk about a lot. In my case, I hope to see my children graduate from high school. But sometimes it crosses my mind that I am so glad that they have their father who can take care of them in case something happens to me." (The children's father, Daniel Johnston, does not have H.I.V.)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that every year 6,000 H.I.V.-infected women give birth in the United States, and most are on some kind of antiretroviral therapy. In the era before medication was recommended for pregnant H.I.V.-infected women, 1,000 to 2,000 babies were born with the virus each year. But from 1992 to 1999, there has been a vast decrease in children born with H.I.V. Now, about 300 to 400 H.I.V.-infected babies are born each year.
In the past, most H.I.V.-positive pregnant women had no idea they were infected until after they became pregnant and it was discovered by routine testing. But that has changed.
Dr. Janet Stein, associate director of perinatology at Beth Israel Hospital in New York, who treats about 20 to 40 H.I.V.-positive pregnant women each year, said: "Before, most women who came to me happened to be positive and happened to be pregnant. Now we're seeing more women who know they're positive, who are well and are deciding to have children."
The first trickle of good news came in 1994 when a study of 477 women found that administering a three-part regimen of the drug AZT to an H.I.V.-positive pregnant woman could reduce the rate of mother-to-child viral transmission by nearly 70 percent. The findings were so important that the research trial was stopped in order to offer AZT to women in the group who had received the placebo but had not yet delivered, and to their infants less than 6 weeks old. 
Because of the new information, the following year, the Public Health Service recommended universal prenatal H.I.V. counseling and H.I.V. testing with consent for all pregnant women in the United States. (In 1997, New York State began the controversial practice of mandatory testing of newborns without consent; only New York and Connecticut have such testing in place.)
More recently, studies have shown that combination therapy, the regimen of combining several antiretroviral medications that has prolonged life for many people infected with H.I.V., can, along with AZT, lower the risk of perinatal transmission even further. Taking combination therapy to reduce the amount of virus in the bloodstream to undetectable levels can decrease the chance of mother-to-child transmission to about 1 percent.
Despite the success stories, researchers remain troubled by the possibility of long-term effects from very potent medication on both mother and child.
"None of the drugs are nontoxic," said Dr. Lynne M. Mofenson, associate branch chief for clinical research at the Pediatric, Adolescent and Maternal AIDS Branch of the National Institutes of Health. "These findings should not deter women from taking the medication, but it's very important to acknowledge that babies need follow-up long term to monitor any potential effects in the future."
Although a continuing seven-year follow-up of the original mothers and infants involved in the 1994 AZT research does not point to any significant differences in health problems between children exposed to the medication before birth and those whose mothers received the placebo, other research has proved worrisome. Animal studies have shown an elevated risk of cancer in rats whose mothers were exposed to AZT while pregnant. These problems, however, have not been seen in human studies, though it may be too soon to tell.
Also of concern are the deaths of four children exposed to AZT, or AZT and other antiretrovirals, from a rare condition known as mitochondrial toxicity. This problem can lead to central nervous system disorders and gastrointestinal problems.
"Ultimately, the long-term effects of anti retroviral therapies on the fetus are unknown," said Dr. Ruth Tuomala, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Harvard Medical School and a principal investigator on the Women and Infants Transmission study, an H.I.V./AIDS project financed by the National Institutes of Health. "There is a continual need to follow up through the lifetimes of children who received these very potent substances."
H.I.V.-infected women and their physicians can learn how to prevent transmitting the virus to their babies by consulting the Public Health Services perinatal guidelines, which are posted on the H.I.V./AIDS Treatment Information Service Web site (www.hivatis.org). 
Dr. Stein said she checked the Web site frequently for updates. She said most of her patients were already on some kind of anti retroviral therapy before they first saw her. In that case, she said, they would stay on the therapy throughout the pregnancy and then receive an intravenous dose of AZT during delivery, the time of greatest risk of perinatal transmission. The baby would then be given AZT for six weeks after birth and be tested for H.I.V. at age one month.
A woman may also choose to deliver by Caesarean section, which may lower the risk of transmission in some cases. But the surgery has risks of its own, and doctors say it may not always be the best option.
Although everything may go right, much can go wrong. Juggling combinations of medications with the complexities of pregnancy can be tricky. Jill, a 37-year-old patient of Dr. Stein's, who asked that her full name not be used, decided to get pregnant in the mid-90's after hearing about the AZT study. But once she was ready, she found that she needed fertility treatments to conceive. After several years, she became pregnant, only to find herself resistant to AZT. She stayed on the other antiretroviral drugs she had taken since 1996 and decided on a scheduled Caesarean section, to lower her risk of transmitting the virus. 
After a nerve-racking premature labor, she delivered her son, who at 8 months old is H.I.V. negative.
"I went through thinking I was going to die, to then considering surrogacy and adoption and then finally considered the possibility of actually getting pregnant," she said. "After all that, to now have a healthy baby after all that we went through is truly a miracle."
For some women, the joy of motherhood may be tempered by the stress of caring for a baby while also struggling with their own health problems. Marcya G. Owens of Atlanta discovered she was infected with H.I.V. in 1994, while pregnant with her daughter, who was born uninfected. After learning about the reduced risk of perinatal transmission, she and her husband, Roy, decided a few years ago to have another child, and her 2-year-old son is also H.I.V. negative. Still, even though she is on combination therapy, she worries that her illness will interfere with her ability to take care of her children. 
"Women with kids get tired and worn out, so you can imagine what it's like fighting a disease as well," said Ms. Owens, 31, who works for the DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company. "Last year I had pneumonia and the kids saw me taken away in an ambulance. Having a positive mother takes a toll on my children."
Still, she remains upbeat. "My long-term progress is good," she said. "I really expect to see my kids graduate from high school, go to college and give me some grandchildren. Being a mother is an experience I'm grateful that I didn't have to miss."
Previous articles in this series have examined current research on new treatments and vaccines; the effect of AIDS on New York City; the lives of AIDS doctors; the effect of AIDS on the federal government; the economics of the care of AIDS patients; and the toll of AIDS on black women in the rural South.
Later articles will examine increases in risky sexual behavior and the effects of AIDS on the arts.

HEADLINE: Time of Growing Pains for Information Age 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS OVERBYE 

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, Conn. 

 BODY:
These would seem to be heady times to be a computer scientist. This is the information age, in which, we are told, biology is defined by a three-billion-letter instruction manual called the genome and human thoughts are analogous to digital bits flowing through a computer. And, we are warned, human intellect will soon be dwarfed by superintelligent machines.
 "All kinds of people," said Jaron Lanier, a computer scientist and musician, "are happy to tell us what we do is the central metaphor, the best explanation of everything from biology to economics to aesthetics to child rearing, sex, you name it. It's very ego-gratifying." 
 Mr. Lanier is the lead scientist of the National Tele-Immersion Initiative, a virtual reality system that has been designed for the Internet. 
He and six other scientists were sitting under a maple tree one recent afternoon worrying whether this headiness was justified. They found instead that they could not even agree on useful definitions of their field's most common terms, like "information" and "complexity," let alone the meaning and future of this revolution.
The other scientists were two computer science professors, Dr. David Gelernter of Yale and Dr. Jordan Pollack of Brandeis University; three physicists, Dr. Brian Greene of Columbia, Dr. Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Dr. Lee Smolin of the Center for Gravitational Physics and Geometry at Penn State; and a psychologist and neuroscientist, Dr. Marc Hauser of Harvard.
John Brockman, a literary agent who represents these scientists, had convened them at the country house here that he shares with his wife and partner, Katinka Matson. Mr. Brockman said he had been inspired to gather the group by a conversation with Dr. Seth Lloyd, a professor of mechanical engineering and quantum computing expert at M.I.T. Mr. Brockman recently posted Dr. Lloyd's statement on his Web site, www.edge.org: "Of course, one way of thinking about all of life and civilization," Dr. Lloyd said, "is as being about how the world registers and processes information. Certainly that's what sex is about; that's what history is about."
Humans have always tended to try to envision the world and themselves in terms of the latest technology. In the 17th and 18th centuries, for example, workings of the cosmos were thought of as the workings of a clock, and the building of clockwork automata was fashionable. But not everybody in the world of computers and science agrees with Dr. Lloyd that the computation metaphor is ready for prime time.
Several of the people gathered under the maple tree had come in the hopes of debating that issue with Dr. Lloyd, but he could not attend at the last moment. Others were drawn by what Dr. Greene called "the glimmer of a unified language" in which to talk about physics, biology, neuroscience and other realms of thought. What happened instead was an illustration of how hard it is to define a revolution from the inside.
Scientifically, the information age can be said to have begun in 1948 when Dr. Claude E. Shannon, a researcher at Bell Laboratories, proposed that information could be defined as the number of ones and zeros -- bits -- that it took to encode a message in binary language. His mathematical formulation of that implied a link between information and entropy, a measure of disorder that plays a deep role in many areas of physics, like heat, gases and black holes.
Some scientists have suggested applying Dr. Shannon's definition of information to situations other than the sending of messages, to things like the human genome or even the universe. According to one interpretation of recent theories in high-energy particle physics, the universe can be portrayed as nothing more than a vast network of information flow -- that is to say, as a computer.
In principle, Dr. Smolin said, a piece of metal or an orange could be said to have an information content and the object's behavior, rusting or ripening, could be thought of as a computation. But he added, "We have not yet constructed physics on those grounds and have no idea if we will be able to."
The assembled scientists, however, argued that Dr. Shannon's definition of information, based on counting bits, did not give a meaningful result in every situation. For example, if you have two copies of a book, you have twice as many bits and thus twice as much information, but you are not necessarily better informed.
Not all bits are equal, after all. The words "I do," spoken in one context, say, by the participants in a wedding, have a much larger consequence than if spoken elsewhere. An article on the front page of a newspaper receives more attention than one of equal length inside.
The recently completed sequencing of the human genome furnishes another example of the futility of counting bits. The first analysis revealed far fewer genes than expected. The potency of the genome, biologists are saying, arises from relationships among the genes and from their interactions in the environment of a womb, rather than their sheer number. The different parts of the genetic code are, in effect, able to turn one another on and off.
Such effects, in a long computer code or in the various contexts of real life, Mr. Lanier said, "create lenses" that magnify some bits while the rest are lost in statistical noise and never affect the world. How to distinguish and quantify the bit that have an impact? Mr. Lanier suggested making a distinction between the maximum potential information in a system -- the total number of bits -- and the causal impact of those bits.
The ambiguities in the meaning of information make it even more difficult to define a way to measure another much bandied-about concept in computer science, namely complexity. Which is a problem, Dr. Pollack explained, because without a quantitative definition of complexity, scientists have no objective way to evaluate the intelligence of a new robot or a computer program or of the process that created them.
One difficulty, Dr. Smolin and the others pointed out, is that a simple program can give a complex result. Examples are the beautiful fractal patterns, depicting shapes within shapes within shapes, known as the Mandelbrot set, after the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot. They can be generated by a simple computer code. So where does the complexity reside?
Another example, maintained Dr. Pollack, is life itself, which, he pointed out had begun billions of years ago as a pool of random chemicals, running its own "simple program" and baking in the sun. "Over time you would wind up with something that I would argue was more complex than the initial program," he said.
On the other hand there are things that appear simpler than their beginnings, like a fine novel whose polished prose belies the many drafts and years of struggle it took to write. Living organisms today are made of a relatively few number of genes and amino acids, but that is the result of billions of years of evolution in nature's computer.
Any useful definition of complexity of some system, the scientists suggested, should include some measure of how much energy or time or computation it took to produce or change the system. "I think complexity is mostly sort of crummy stuff that is there because it's too expensive to change the interface," Mr. Lanier said.
Woven among the day's discussions was a running criticism, often scathing, of the state of modern computer technology as it applies to ordinary people. Dr. Gelernter described current software as "crummy," and modern computers, laden with incomprehensible user manuals and unneeded features, as "more a source of irritation, dissatisfaction and angst than a positive benefit."
He was particularly scornful of the ubiquitous organization of information into folders and files, a notion he said belonged in offices of the 1940's. He said he expected it to be replaced by a scheme in which computers receive and catalog information chronologically in a continuous stream.
But his colleagues saw little hope for such a change, as attractive as it might be. The reason, Dr. Pollack and Mr. Lanier bothsaid, was that in the evolution of computer systems, as in biological evolution, old and inefficient features often became embedded in the system, like the blind spot in the retina of the eye. Natural selection, he said, does not optimize every aspect of an organism. In short, files now, files forever.
Dr. Pollack had come armed with a demonstration of the vicissitudes of evolution in the form of his lab's latest robot, a tinkertoy assemblage of arms and joints. It was the knobby result of a process of evolution that had taken place inside a computer commanded to design a robot that would move, then to simulate the behavior of the robot, tweak the design, simulate the behavior of the next robot, and so on. Another computer was then commanded to build the robot that resulted.
Let loose, the battery-powered "tinkerbot" stretched and folded sporadically, like a crab shuffling across the table. Someone asked what a pair of extensions sticking out sideways from the middle of the robot were for. "We don't know," Dr. Pollack answered. Then one of the robot's legs fell off, perhaps illustrating its lack of Darwinian fitness.
Extracting a conclusion from this daylong session was an exercise in information and complexity theory itself. Dr. Gelernter expressed dismay at what he called his colleagues' "defeatist" attitude toward current technology. "The idea that we can't change is indefensible," he said. "They know the field has been turned over every five years."
Mr. Lanier judged the day as "a notch upward" in his efforts to engage the physicists in a dialogue. Dr. Greene said the most interesting aspect was "how hard it was to define something that seems so obvious."
"I'm still trying to figure out what happened," said Dr. Pollack, who described the day as "searching for a vocabulary." He said he been surprised and heartened to find that other people were asking the same questions he was, even if they didn't get the same answers. "I felt like I found a soul mate," he said.

HEADLINE: More Than Just a Nuisance, A Virtuoso of Disease 

BYLINE:  By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
It is the height of summer, and the mosquito is out and about, determined to spoil everyone's good time.
 But for millions of people, including thousands in this country each year, the mosquito is far more than a pest. For them this insect -- a quarter-inch long and weighing a tiny fraction of an ounce -- carries serious disease and sometimes death. Mosquitoes and the malaria they carry may even be the leading impediment to economic growth in the developing world. And, medical science is learning, mosquitoes are full of surprises. 
 Two years ago, New Yorkers learned what Dr. Andrew Spielman calls the first law of mosquitoes: expect the unexpected. 
Until August 1999, most city residents found mosquitoes but occasional summertime pests, to be endured perhaps at an evening concert in Central Park. Then came the news that, somehow or other, a native mosquito, Culex pipiens, the so-called common house mosquito that hangs out in storm sewers and sump pumps but rarely bites people, had acquired an exotic virus that could cause a fatal brain infection, West Nile encephalitis. The virus, named for its discovery in 1937 in the blood of a feverish woman in the West Nile district of Uganda, had never before been seen on this side of the Atlantic. 
But how had the West Nile virus arrived on these shores? Did it enter by way of an infected traveler, by infected mosquitoes that hitched a ride on a plane or ship? Epidemiologists worry it is but the first of many exotic viruses that could use local mosquito species as an incubator and transport system for infecting countless people in the United States.
"It's amazing that it happened, and it may happen again and again," said Dr. Spielman, a Harvard professor and an expert on mosquito-borne illness. With the journalist Michael D'Antonio, Dr. Spielman has written a new book on the subject of his life's work, "Mosquito: A Natural History of Our Most Persistent and Deadly Foe."
"There are other viruses out there -- Rift Valley fever virus, Japanese B encephalitis virus, among them -- that could be imported," said Dr. Spielman, 70.
"However," he said in an interview, "there's no need to reach overseas for exotic viruses transmitted by mosquitoes. There's an enormous number of viruses here now that could bridge from animals to humans via the mosquito."
The 2,500 known species of mosquitoes (150 of them in the United States) cover the gamut of ecological niches and bite at all times of the day and night. Some, like Aedes aegypti, a transmitter of deadly dengue fever in Puerto Rico, reside in or near people's homes, making mass eradication by communitywide spraying a virtual impossibility. Aedes mcintoshi, a vector of Rift Valley fever virus, which has caused huge outbreaks in the Middle East, can survive in its egg stage for decades in a dessicated desert, hatching when it rains. 
C. pipiens, the mosquito that is host to West Nile in New York, seeks its blood meal in the evening. Dr. Spielman said, "It is the mosquito in built-up areas, but it rarely bites people." He has encountered it covering the walls of an African hut like a living carpet, as well as in Paris's subway, the Ginza shopping district of Tokyo and Confucius' graveyard in China.
Like other mosquito species, the female C. pipiens (only females bite) needs just one mating to acquire sufficient sperm to lay two batches of eggs. Each batch consists of about 240 eggs that form a canoe-shaped raft the size of a rice grain.
The eggs are deposited in any available water -- children's pools, trays under flower pots, birdbaths and storm sewers -- and take a week or so to go to larva to pupa to adult. The females bite almost anything to get the blood they need to support egg development. In the process they can acquire, incubate and then transfer several potentially deadly viruses.
In the New York area, the West Nile virus has been isolated from thousands of birds, both wild and zoo-dwelling, as well as from horses, cats, bats, chipmunks, skunks, squirrels, domestic rabbits and raccoons. It has spread along the East Coast from Maine to Florida, and as far west as Ohio.
Experts predict it will take a few summers at most for this viral import to invade most developed areas in the United States. While healthy children and younger adults typically get only a mild infection, the virus can be devastating in the elderly and chronically ill, especially people with diabetes. In its first appearance in New York in August and September 1999, about 60 patients, with an average age of 71, were hospitalized with a documented West Nile infection. Most had signs of encephalitis, and seven died. There were 21 cases, with two deaths, in the nation in 2000. This year, two human cases have been reported, both in Florida.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta reports that for every one person with an obvious West Nile infection, four others have a subclinical illness that goes undetected. The virus multiplies in and often kills birds, the so-called amplifying hosts, and multiplies further in mosquitoes that take blood from birds.
But West Nile is far from the worst mosquito-borne infection now in this hemisphere. Dengue fever, relatively unknown in the West until the 1970's, when an epidemic swept through Cuba and other Caribbean countries, produces a spectrum of symptoms, the worst of which is fatal hemorrhagic fever. Aedes aegypti, a daytime biter that prefers human blood, is the principal vector of yellow fever as well as dengue. Dengue is primarily a disease of the tropics, though it threatens to invade the American South.
In Puerto Rico, Dr. Spielman reports, the mosquito that transmits dengue can be found "virtually everywhere on the island, including in a flower vase in my San Juan hotel room during a meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene." At least one person attending the meeting was stricken.
Some experts believe dengue is fast becoming a plague of worldwide dimensions that with global warming may one day eclipse malaria as the most important mosquito-borne illness in people. Now, malaria claims two million lives a year, plus an enormous cost in lost productivity among those who become infected and ill but do not die. It is transmitted by the nighttime bite of an Anopheles mosquito, which threatens about 40 percent of the world's population.
In this country, West Nile is not the only form of mosquito-borne encephalitis that threatens people. Every summer, about 120 people are stricken with St. Louis encephalitis, a brain infection transmitted by C. pipiens, the West Nile vector. The virus can survive the winter in blood-gorged females that take refuge in barns, caves and other protected places. About 15 percent of victims die, and some survivors suffer lasting emotional disturbances.
La Crosse encephalitis, named for the Wisconsin city where it was discovered in the 1960's in a child who died, now occurs widely across the country. It is spread by a late-afternoon biter, Aedes triseriatus, a woodland dweller that breeds in water-filled tree holes and old tires.
The virus can be transmitted from the mother mosquito to her eggs, so no animal host is needed to perpetuate it. Nearly all victims of La Crosse encephalitis are children under 15, and 90 percent are males. One in 25 who are infected develop encephalitis, and 1 percent die.
Western equine encephalitis, spread by Culex tarsalis in the Western states, also can cause serious illness, especially in children. But here the risk of developing encephalitis from an infected bite is only one in a thousand, with a death rate of 5 percent.
The deadliest mosquito-borne viral infection is Eastern equine encephalitis, a disease of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts that can strike people of all ages with a mortality rate of 30 percent to 50 percent. Fortunately, it is still rare, and it is likely to remain so. The virus infects birds that roost near freshwater swamps, where the swamp mosquito Culiseta melanura dwells. But this insect almost never bites people. Rather, people acquire the disease when some other mosquito, known as a bridge vector, bites an infected bird and then bites a person.
The most feared mosquito these days, the aggressive Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is unlikely to cause more than an annoying, itchy bite. Although it carries disease in Asia, this pest, which arrived here in the 1960's in tire shipments from Japan, "is willing to feed on almost anything," and that willingness invalidates it as a host for infection, Dr. Spielman said. "Since the female mosquito usually feeds on blood only twice," he said, "if it bites the wrong host where the virus cannot multiply, it's a dead end."
It is perhaps of little consolation to know four facts about mosquitoes: the most common biter here, the well-named warm weather mosquito, Aedes vexans, along with A. excrucians of the northern woods and A. tormentor of the southern woods, are at worst bridge vectors; mosquitoes cannot transmit the AIDS virus; human blood is usually inferior to that from other animals for fostering mosquito egg development, and for many mosquito-borne viruses people are dead-end hosts.
This last fact means that viruses cannot multiply adequately in human blood to infect the next mosquito that bites. Thus, it is unlikely that a disease like West Nile arrived here via an infected person traveling from an endemic area, according to Dr. Kenneth L. Tyler of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver.
In an editorial in June in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Tyler urged his fellow physicians to "remain alert for new outbreaks of disease in animals, which may herald related events in humans."
Do mosquitoes have a saving grace? Not according to Dr. Spielman, who said he knew of no species of plant or animal that was completely dependent upon the mosquito for survival. True, nectar-feeding male and female mosquitoes help to pollinate some flowers, and mosquito larvae and adults are fare for fish, frogs, bats, birds, dragonflies and other insects. But all would survive if suddenly every mosquito were to disappear from the face of the earth, not that this is likely to happen soon enough for people who have already lost a pint of blood this summer to mosquitoes that hatched after the spring floods in the South and Midwest.

With mosquitoes, says Dr. Andrew Spielman, an expert on the illnesses they carry, people should expect the unexpected.

Waiting for a Train, Waiting for Stardom

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
 If you go down into the subway with a notebook and a pen and try to ask people questions -- even if you display a card that identifies you as an employee of a major metropolitan newspaper -- you will get reactions that can be broken down into the following broad categories.

1. Please leave me alone, you nut, or I will scream.
2. What sort of a scam are you running, man?
3. That's nice. I'm late for work.
4. Am I really going to be in the newspaper?
 These reactions are not usually expressed out loud. They are conveyed by the eyes, the facial expressions or by the feet, walking away from you. The fourth reaction is the rarest, and always a little surprising when it happens.
This is what made it all the more interesting to spend an afternoon in the subway watching people from the television channel MetroTV produce a show called "Subway Q & A," a kind of cult hit on cable in which subway riders are asked funny or embarrassing questions or are propositioned to participate in wacky stunts.
The lesson learned was not a particularly original one, especially these days, but it was still amazing to experience firsthand: by and large, human beings will give their unqualified trust and cooperation to anyone carrying a professional-looking video camera.
An executive on Wall Street will agree to go bowling with an unemployed security guard and a man who lives in his van. Parents will hand over their children to be tended by total strangers. A woman will go fishing with you in Sheepshead Bay.
That this can occur even in the subway, the place where New Yorkers go to perfect the thousand-yard stare and the vow of silence, is a testament to something. To people's intense longing for their 15 minutes, maybe. But perhaps more to the feeling that nothing bad can happen in the presence of a television camera because, somewhere, tens of thousands of witnesses must be watching.
This feeling seems to be even more pronounced in the subway, where a faint shadow remains of the fear that once darkened the system.
The aura of television protection extends to those behind the camera, too: recently, the host of the show, Rich Collier, was trusting enough to put on a suit of body armor and go into the subway with a baseball bat, offering people the opportunity to take out their frustrations on him.
"That was probably the scariest thing I ever did in my life," said Mr. Collier, 36. But it was all for television, and, of course, everything turned out O.K. ("Rich is less neurotic than most talent," said Matthew Kells, the program's producer.)
The program being taped on Thursday did not require as much trust, on either side of the camera. But it was still a good demonstration of the principle. Mr. Collier and a crew of six jammed themselves onto 1 and 9 trains with a prodigious amount of equipment, a bunch of art supplies and a blank stretched canvas, asking ordinary riders to contribute their artistic gifts to make a collective subway painting. The idea was then to find someone who would agree to let the television crew hang the painting in their home.
Vanessa Morales, a recent high school graduate waiting for a train at the 181st Street station, was persuaded in under a minute to get down onto her hands and knees on the platform and sling paint at the canvas like Jackson Pollock. She even seemed to heed Mr. Collier's advice that to become a really good artist, she would need to drink more and generally "become a freaky recluse."
"I think I can try," said Ms. Morales solemnly, paint on her face.
During the afternoon, two midwives, a psychologist, a retired shipping clerk, a cartoonist, a young tourist from North Carolina and several others gladly missed trains and stops to help Mr. Collier in his mission. And then without much trouble he and the crew managed to find a woman named Juliet at the Pennsylvania Station stop who took them all to her mother's new apartment in Bayside, Queens, to hang the painting, which by that point had come to resemble a scary cross between a Basquiat and a Rorschach. ("Why not?" said Juliet's mother, gleefully.)
Of course, there were a few riders who simply would not be persuaded to join the global media village. One woman continued to read "The Picture of Dorian Gray" with no apparent lack of concentration caused by the huge Panasonic camera near her head. An elderly man told Mr. Collier, "I am not interested in whatever it is you're doing."
But many who refused seemed to be almost embarrassed by their unneighborliness. "I am so tired," explained Vebi Muriqi, a porter.
Even the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which can be touchy about taping in the subway, appears to have acquiesced.
"One time we decided to do a re-creation of the Revolutionary War in the subway," Mr. Collier said. "The M.T.A. said, 'So. You're going to chase people around the subway in powdered wigs?' "
"And we said, 'Basically, yeah.' "

HEADLINE: Job Cut Announcements Climbed 65% in July 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
Job cut announcements jumped 65 percent to a record level in July, led by telecommunications, computer, electronic and industrial companies, a report by the outplacement firm of Challenger, Gray & Christmas said today. 
 Announced job cuts in July hit 205,975, up from 124,852 in June. July's total was more than three times the level of job cuts recorded in the same month last year, the report said. 
 "Job cuts tell us as much about the economy's future as they do about the present. Companies are looking at their staffing needs for the balance of 2001 and the numbers do not present a very positive picture," said John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The survey began in 1993. 
For the first half of 2001, United States companies said they planned to cut 777,362 jobs, more than three times the number announced in the first six months of last year. 
The telecommunications sector overtook the technology sector in July in recording the highest number of job-cut announcements. With 44,908 job cuts announced in July, the total number of layoffs announced in the sector hit 175,350 for the first seven months this year. 
Technology companies announced 26,321 layoffs in July bringing the total to 101,044 for the year to date. 
"This is a very, very big surge in layoffs. Basically it says two things: One is that the employment situation is not going to turn around in the near future and will continue to get worse during summer months. It also means that claims will edge higher," said Eric Green, chief economist with BNP Paribas, referring to claims for jobless benefits. 
"But it does not mean much for the market. Everyone knows the labor market is weak and will continue to get weaker in the coming months," he added.

HEADLINE: Hypothesis: Science Gap. Cause: Japan's Ways 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
The paraphernalia of the scientist are nowhere in sight in the huge, anonymous office in central Tokyo where Hideki Shirakawa, a Nobel laureate in chemistry in 2000, spends most of his time these days.
 In between the tedious evaluation of research proposals, his task as head of a new national commission to re-energize Japanese science involves reflecting long and hard on why his country's laboratories have produced so few stars on his level. 
 "Fundamentally, Japanese culture is based on rice farming," said Dr. Shirakawa, 65, reaching for a time-honored explanation for a widely perceived aversion to individual initiative. "Rice cultivation requires a lot of water, and water must be shared evenly by everyone. Planting rice also required teams of people walking from row to row, at the same speed. And all of this has meant that uniqueness had to be suppressed." 
Officially, Dr. Shirakawa's brief involves nothing less than devising a strategy for Japan to win 30 more Nobel prizes in the sciences over the next 50 years. "The figure is way too high," he says with a shrug and a wry smile. "In the last 50 years we've only had six."
Dr. Shirakawa is diplomatic in raising the question of culture in evaluating why Japan, immensely rich with more than a century of universal education and the world's second largest economy, performs more like a modestly endowed middle-ranking country. Others in the scientific community are more scathing in their self-appraisal, and have begun calling for a revolution in the nation's laboratories and classrooms.
The problems they cite include excessive government control over both research funding and education, faculties still steeped in Confucian ideals of age grade promotion and piety toward seniors, and a generalized penchant for seeking incremental advancement of knowledge at the expense of bold experimentation.
But most important of all, disillusioned scientists say that Japan's research community has never managed to fully embrace peer review and criticism, whose sparks have always served to light creative fires in the West -- from Newton and Hooke to Einstein and Planck.
"There is a lack of competition and critical evaluation in Japan," said Ikuo Kushiro, director of the Institute of Frontier Research of Earth Evolution, a former vice president of Tokyo University, whose role in this highly centralized country roughly approximates that of Harvard, Stanford and M.I.T. combined. "Promotions don't depend on the size of one's contribution, but rather on their years of service, and scientists are very friendly, and tend to avoid debate. 
"I worked at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, and I knew two eminent scientists who were good friends, but once it came to their work, they would have severe debates, even in the journals. That kind of thing happens in the United States, but in Japan, never."
Although few outside Japan worry about the problem, the stakes are truly global. Just as Japan's economy, mired in recurrent recessions for 11 years, now constitutes a huge drag on the world's economy, the underperformance of the world's second richest country in scientific matters exacts a steep, but invisible cost in issues as diverse as fighting malaria and AIDS to understanding global warming.
"Global science needs as many competent players as possible to address the thorny problems of health and the environment, and to make accurate statements on issues ranging from world climatic change to species endangerment and antibiotic-resistant organisms," wrote Samuel J. Coleman, author of "Japanese Science: From the Inside," (Routledge, 1999) in a recent essay. "As long as Japan is unable to translate its wealth and talent into substantial scientific contributions we are all the poorer for it." 
On the surface, things might not appear so bleak for Japanese science. From the early 1990's, spending on research increased dramatically, as media reports here focused on the shoddy state of the country's university laboratories. Japan has sought to break out of the scientific ghetto of applied research, the long-favored emphasis on research with direct commercial applications. 
Japan now spends roughly half as much on scientific research as the United States ($118 billion compared with $229 billion in 1999, according to government statistics), more than twice as much as its closest rival in the West, Germany. As a result of those efforts, 9 percent of the articles published in scientific and technical journals worldwide in 1995 were by Japanese authors, according to the National Science Foundation, a United States Government agency.
The spending increase may yield future leaps in knowledge, and garner Nobels, which are often awarded for work done several years earlier. In the last decade, however, Dr. Shirakawa was the only Japanese scientist to win a Nobel, for his work with other scientists to create a plastic that conducts electricity like a metal. Scientists in the United States won 44 Nobels in the last 10 years, Germany five, and France three.
Nobel prizes are, of course, only one way to measure scientific output. But even a recent government paper here acknowledged that Japanese global influence on scientific research remains modest. 
"The Japanese government usually thinks it must increase funding to research," said Syukuro Manabe, a renowned climate physicist who has spent most of his career working in the United States. "But that alone will not enhance research productivity. Research funding must go to those who deserve funding rather than distributing it equally. They have to find some way to support the really distinguished researchers who deserve support, rather than those who do research for the sake of research. What we need to create is job insecurity rather than security to make people compete more."
Dr. Manabe recently returned to Japan after 40 years spent mostly in American government climate laboratories abroad to head the Frontier Research System for Global Change, a richly government-funded climate study institute. He created a stir last week, however, with a surprise announcement that he had decided to leave Japan once again for the United States. 
"In the funding system here decisions are made by a committee of distinguished scientists appointed by the ministry of education, but if we want to do better, we'll have to come up with true peer review system, like the one maintained by the National Science Foundation in the United States," Dr. Manabe said. "Many of my fellow scientists agree with me, but then they say I am too Americanized, and complain that real peer review in Japan won't work. 
"The reason we have difficulty establishing a peer review system has to do with a kind of an Asian culture. You don't want to speak openly in criticism of someone else's work. It is kind of a mutual admiration society, and that has real consequences."
At Japan's ministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology, a gigantic bureaucracy that controls most of the grants for research here, officials say they have recognized that simply throwing huge sums of money at science will not increase scientific output.
"We've introduced a term system for researchers in our national labs, and increased merit rewards for people with good ideas," said Nobuaki Kawakami, director of the ministry's division of planning and evaluation. "We've been trying to increase competitiveness and career mobility in science because we recognize this as one of the most important problems we have to tackle."
Repeating a grievance that was echoed by many scientists themselves, he said, "Our researchers tend to choose easy projects, which is to say, building on things that are already known, so that they can expect results quickly."
Many scientists applaud those kinds of changes, but insist that much more will need to be done in order to lift Japan to the ranks of a real power in science.
"Things are changing and that is very encouraging," said Okamoto Hitoshi, an expert in vertebrate development who at 43 is a relatively young laboratory chief. "But the slots available to young people, although no longer zero, are still very few compared to the United States. 
"Our level is not so low that you can get a promotion without doing good science these days. But it is true that the criticism between us is not so great. Teachers still tell you that eloquence may be silver, but silence is golden."

HEADLINE: Town Stakes Out Future on Higher Ground 

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: GRUNDY, Va., July 31 

 BODY:
The rains keep falling here in the heart of Appalachia, turning old coal towns into flooded disaster zones and destroying hundreds of houses of stoic residents who can only accept what nature has cruelly delivered this summer. But not so here, not in this fading riverfront town that hopes to resurrect itself with an ingenious leap across the river in one of the most complex flood control projects in the nation. 
 Grundy, a western Virginia town with a population of 1,175, plans to move its downtown to higher ground by digging into a mountain just across the chronically treacherous Levisa River. The flattened mountain tract is to be the base for a new town center replete with wireless communications and usable land that will double the size of the current six-acre, flood-sodden commercial heart. 
 The Army Corps of Engineers, which wrestles with the nation's flood problems, says that in 65 years of flood control projects, this is the first time something so elaborate has been attempted by carving fresh space to save a town in such a tight turn of steep mountains and narrow hollows. Though the project is not without opposition, town officials say it is far from a pork barrel windfall and will, in fact, save Grundy as well as federal and state money by combining flood control with a highway project. 
"The trick all along has been how to do this without killing the town you're trying to save," said Chuck Crabtree, the town manager, as he watched surveyors take the measure of the mountain that looms just 100 yards west of the town's riverfront. "This is survival. We have to make it happen." 
With its $1.5 million annual budget, Grundy has managed to become the beneficiary of a $177 million project combining resources of the Corps of Engineers and the State Department of Transportation. The remake is to leave this old lumber and coal town higher and drier. In the end, a picturesque bend in the river that has often given way to flood waters is to become a futuristic swath of Appalachian levee with a highway on top. 
"We're on track, ready to cut the top of the mountain," said Mayor W. Harold Trivett of the plan to blast away 300 feet. "My shop will eventually be taken, but what can you do when you've been flooded out three times?" The mayor had to refinance his home and his clothing store after the 1977 flood, which killed three people and caused $15 million in damages. 
Jim Twohig, the corps' project director, said that after studying a variety of alternatives, from dams to channel widening, the mountain shaving approach was chosen as less expensive and more beneficial for Grundy. The corps has built more than 370 large and small dams in more than half a century under its congressional mandate of flood control. This project has thus far avoided the environmental litigation that many dam projects have spurred.
"This is going to be like a laboratory project because there are so many people interested in it in terms of utilities, of opportunities in communications and all the rest," said Steve Wright of the corps. "The more people find out about it, the more excitement is building."
Planners say the combined project will save tens of millions of dollars for the corps and Virginia. The state was facing a federal mandate to make a four-lane highway of old U.S. 460, the town's main street, a project local officials say would have bypassed Grundy and killed the town. Instead, the road is to lace across the top of a new eight-foot-high levee, just across the river from the transported downtown, with short bridges unifying Grundy's new center and old remains.
"Congressman Rick Boucher put all the pieces together and got everyone to look at the project in a different way," Mr. Crabtree said. After years of doubts and disputes, Mr. Boucher, a Democrat, proposed dovetailing the projects of corps and highway planners, who usually operate as powerful separate fiefs. 
One result is that the $25 million share required by the federal government from the town -- an impossible sum for Grundy -- will be put up in the form of land acquisitions that the state agreed to donate to the town because of the cost savings in combining the projects. The new land is to be created by flattening the mountain, then spilling the 2.3 million cubic yards of earthen residue into Wellmore Hollow, a nearby valley that is to be raised. 
More than three dozen storefronts and businesses and at least 16 homes are to be razed in the old town's floodway along the Levisa's east shore. Behind the levee, various structures will be spared, including the Grundy Bible Church and the historic Buchanan County Courthouse. At the edge of the levee, owners of attractive riverfront homes may sell to the government or accept flood-proofing and have their properties raised four feet.
Critics of the project, noting it would take up to 10 years to complete, say it is too elaborate and risk-laden with no certainty that the new town will fulfill development hopes for 50 housing units and dozens of stores and offices. While federal flood control money is assured, the state's continuing share for highway construction will depend on future legislatures, opponents emphasize.
"We need some flood-proofing but it could be done much less expensively," said Michael G. McGlothlin, a lawyer. Mr. McGlothlin contends that the old downtown charm will be lost while the cut mountain and the levee across the way will make the new town seem as if it sits in a rock quarry.
"This puts us in a state of limbo for years and years in the midst of a project that is all-consuming," Mr. McGlothlin said. 
But the doomed properties are mostly dowdy, Depression-era storefronts, Mr. Crabtree said. "We're building a new town and wiping out old blight," he said. 
With the region suffering unemployment in excess of 10 percent as coal mining fades, Grundy, the county seat, is the key to revival hopes extending well beyond its narrow straits. 
"My granddad was a coal miner and his blood, sweat and tears are in this country," Mr. Crabtree said. "This project means as much to the past as it does to the future," he said, looking down into the steep greenery of Wellmore Hollow where some of the new Grundy is to arise.

HEADLINE: A Tight Call As New Jersey Celebrates Its Affluence 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
Which state is the richest?
 It looked yesterday as if New Jersey had hit the jackpot, at least according to news reports on an experimental Census Bureau survey in which a sampling of people across the country were asked a lot of questions about such things as whether they had a flush toilet in their mobile home, what kind of fuel they used and how much money they had made the previous year. 
 "A State of Affluence," one New Jersey front page crowed. "A Land of Plenty," said another. The nation's "epicenter of affluence" had "shifted a few golf courses to the southwest, to New Jersey," readers were informed. Even the state's Department of Labor concluded, "New Jersey's median household income ranked as the highest in the nation." 
Connecticut, the suggestion went, was slipping. And look who was on top. Never mind that New Jersey, Connecticut and Alaska have had the highest median household incomes for years, and that their numbers are too close to be reliably ranked.
And never mind that Connecticut's per capita income still tops New Jersey's, and that the Census Bureau itself had warned that the numbers from the new survey, conducted in 2000, might not be strictly comparable with earlier ones.
"Scientifically speaking, if you tested for statistical significance, the difference between New Jersey and Connecticut most likely would not be statistically significant," said Kirby Posey, a survey statistician in the income surveys branch of the Census Bureau. "When you're looking at rankings like this, you have to be careful."
James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said that any difference between the two states' household-income figures was minimal.
"If you're No. 1 or No. 2 or No. 3, you're still very affluent," he said. "So the few dollars' difference between them on per capita income and median household income really does not differentiate one strongly from the other."
The numbers came from something confusingly called the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey, which is not the 2000 census but rather a test of a new way of collecting detailed census data. Under the program being tested, to go into effect later in the decade, the bureau would collect detailed data from a national sample of three million households each year.
According to the numbers made public yesterday, the estimate of New Jersey's median household income in the previous year was $54,226. Connecticut's was $53,108 and Alaska's $52,876. But because of the uncertainty of those figures -- given the limitations of any such surveys -- the ranges of certainty for all three states overlapped.
Mr. Posey and others said it was not possible to reliably rank median household incomes from those three states because of the overlap. Mr. Posey said, "You can say with statistical certainty that New Jersey's was higher than Nebraska's, but you can't say with certainty that New Jersey's was higher than Connecticut's."
"Connecticut has always been No. 1 in per capita income and New Jersey is usually second or third in per capita," Mr. Hughes said. "But on the annual Current Population Survey data, New Jersey's household and family income is usually higher than Connecticut's. So it's not surprising that New Jersey has the highest median household income."
Both measures are important methods of calculating overall wealth, he said. And both are used widely in such things as placing new stores and marketing services and products.
As for which state is now more lucrative territory, Mr. Hughes said yesterday, "Any chain worth its salt is going to want to be in both markets."

HEADLINE: Operating Profit Is Off at British Air 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 6 

 BODY:
British Airways, Europe's leading airline, which is seeking an alliance with American Airlines, said today that its operating profit fell 48 percent in the quarter ended June 30. The company blamed an array of factors -- from Britain's continuing foot-and-mouth disease crisis to higher fuel costs -- and said its situation would probably remain bleak until next summer.
 Analysts and investors said the results were roughly what had been expected, and British Airways stock rose 1.2 percent, to 343 pence ($4.90) a share. 
 As more European vacationers turn to fast-growing discount airlines like Ryanair and easyJet, British Airways has been moving decisively toward the upper end of the market, cutting the number of economy seats on its flights to concentrate on pampering business travelers. From July 2000 to last month, British Airways cut the overall capacity of its fleet 9.1 percent.
The bias toward business class helped partly insulate it from a falloff in tourist travel to Britain, particularly among Americans troubled by the sight of sheep and cattle carcasses being burned to combat foot-and-mouth disease. But a larger economic slowdown, particularly in the United States, tightened corporate travel budgets, the company said.
British Airways' strategy produced one surprise for analysts in the quarterly results: A sharp 12.9 percent increase in yield -- revenue the airline earns per passenger for each mile flown -- compared with the similar quarter in 2000. 
Against that, though, came a 0.6 percent fall in total sales, coupled with a 7.8 percent increase in costs, pushing operating profit down to $:50 million ($71.4 million) from $:97 million in the period last year. Higher fuel prices, exchange-rate shifts and capacity-reduction measures pushed up costs, the company said. After a gain of $:100 million from selling Go, a discount subsidiary, British Airways posted a $:26 million net profit; it lost $:42 million in the 2000 quarter.
Rod Eddington, the chief executive, said tougher times were ahead. "The real challenge will come in the winter period," he said. "It's too early to say with any certainty what that period is going to look like."
That gloomy assessment was echoed when KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said today that it would cut capacity 3 percent this winter.
British Airways usually earns the bulk of its profits in summer, but recent figures suggest that the slowdown this year has taken a toll on business- and economy-class travel.
The difficulties have added urgency to British Airways' plans, announced last Friday, to renew efforts to form a cost-cutting alliance with American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation. Mr. Eddington said the two airlines would seek an exemption from American antitrust laws in the next few days and would also ask British and European regulators to approve an alliance. Regulators are expected to require the two carriers to give up some landing and takeoff slots at London's congested Heathrow airport. 
"That is a matter for the regulators to decide what the price will be, and we will then decide whether or not the deal is worth doing based on the regulatory price," Mr. Eddington said.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Britain: Bank Profit 

BYLINE:  By Alan Cowell (NYT) 

 BODY:
 After a $20 billion acquisition spree the last two years to move away from dependence on emerging markets, HSBC, the biggest British bank, beat some analysts' forecasts with a 4 percent rise in first-half net profit to $3.67 billion. 
The figure included a one-time gain of $667 million from disposals. Analysts said profits rose because of growing European business, particularly from the acquisition of Credit de Commercial de France, and lower-than-expected provisions against bad debts. John Bond, HSBC's chairman, warned, however, that the outlook for the financial services industry was unclear because of increasingly fragile economic conditions in certain emerging markets and the slowdown in the United States economy.

BYLINE:  By Kevin Sack (NYT)

 BODY:
 Civil rights veterans like the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Andrew J. Young and Joseph E. Lowery appeared at the annual meeting of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Montgomery to support Martin Luther King III, above, the organization's embattled president. Mr. 
King had been criticized by the chairman of the group's board as arrogant and ineffectual.
