HEADLINE: DOLLAR, IN PLUNGE, HITS ALL-TIME LOW AGAINST THE MARK

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar, plagued by a weak economy and more attractive interest rates abroad, plunged to all-time lows against the German mark yesterday. The decline dragged down the American bond and stock markets and raised fears of economic disruptions both in the United States and Europe.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.5 percent, or 50.79 points, to close at 3,254.10, while the bond market gave up gains it made in the last two weeks. The sharp fall in the markets is an unwelcome development for the President, who in his acceptance speech on Thursday night asked voters to trust him as the better steward of the nation's economy. 
 Initially, traders appeared to be granting the President his wish, as stocks and bonds rose, but those rallies were turned into routs.
 
Currency Traders Lead
 "The whole downdraft in stocks and bonds is off the dollar," said Joseph Liro, a financial economist at S. G. Warburg & Company in New York. "The central banks came in, rattled their swords, and they scared nobody."
If the dollar's slide cannot be contained, confidence in the American economy could be damaged. The cost of imports could rise, increasing inflation. And investors could push up long-term interest rates, threatening an already fragile recovery. The dollar's fall, analysts said, could also intensify the tensions within the European Community, where the mark is the dominant currency, forcing even higher interest rates there and threatening the chances for a smooth transition to a unified Europe by the end of the century.
 
Repeated Efforts Fail
 The Federal Reserve, 14 European central banks and the Bank of Canada bought dollars repeatedly in the foreign exchange market yesterday in an unsuccessful effort to support the sinking currency. By the end of the day, the dollar had fallen more than 1 percent against the mark.
Analysts are anxious about the outlook both here and in Europe because there is no simple way to halt a further decline in the dollar. Higher interest rates would support the dollar by attracting more foreign investment, but the Federal Reserve cannot raise short-term interest rates without strangling an economic recovery that is already nearly lifeless. Still, the mere possibility of higher rates upset the stock and bond markets.
Conversely, a cut in European rates would narrow the differential of more than six percentage points that now favors the mark and other European currencies over the dollar. But such rate cuts are unlikely because the Germans, who set the European economic tone, have insisted on higher rates to fight inflation after the unification of the two Germanys.
This leaves international economic cooperation, which is supposed to ease the transition through difficult economic times, in gridlock. Intervention in the foreign exchange markets by central banks is the only tool left to support the dollar. But it may not be effective alone, if traders are betting that the United States and its economic allies will not take more powerful economic steps to support the foundering currency.
"You are raising all kinds of concerns," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation in New York.
In late trading in New York, the dollar was at 1.4295 against the mark, 1 percent below the previous record closing low in New York of 1.4470, which it reached Thursday. The dollar also easily pierced the 1.4430 level, the lowest level reached in intraday trading since the mark was created in 1948. The dollar also fell sharply against the pound, the Swiss franc and the French franc. It fell less sharply against the yen because Japan's economy is in crisis and interest rates in Japan are not very high.
 
Intervention Called Mild
 John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said one reason the intervention was not very effective was that the amount of dollar buying was not large, although there were as many as five rounds of intervention, and 16 central banks involved. And, he added, the mildness of the intervention effort might signal that the United States and its allies did not care if the dollar declined further, as long as the fall is slow and orderly.
In the bond market, the failure of the intervention wiped out a rally that came in part on relief that Mr. Bush emphasized the need to reduce Federal spending and the budget deficits. It had pushed up the price on the Treasury's 30-year bond and reduced yields to levels not seen since the summer of 1986. But in late trading the price of the 30-year bond was down almost half a point, or $4 for a $1,000 face value, and the yield had jumped to 7.35 percent, from 7.26 percent earlier in the day.
The dollar has been falling since the spring for two main reasons: the lack of a strong economic recovery here and the wide difference in interest rates available to investors here and in Europe. A strong economic recovery in the United States would have attracted foreign investment and, therefore, dollar buying.
In addition, interest rates in Europe are three times higher than in America. This makes it very costly to hold dollars instead of marks or other European currencies.
 
Regulating the Rate of Decline
 Analysts said the dollar-intervention effort had two purposes. One goal was to keep the dollar's decline, which has been persistent but slow recently, from shifting into high gear. Such a fall could panic investors by shaking confidence in the outlook for the United States economy. The Federal Reserve might be prevented from lowering interest rates further to help the recovery because that could weaken the dollar more.
The second goal is to weaken the German mark and reduce the tension that is threatening harmony within the European Monetary System. The French are to vote in September on the Maastricht Treaty, which outlines the road to a political and economic union in Europe by 1999. A fall in the dollar could force a realignment of the exchange rates within the system or an increase in interest rates. Either move could play into the hands of the opponents of a unified Europe and lead to a French vote against the Maastricht Treaty. That would definitely set back the drive to unity.
 
Good and Bad Effects
 Beyond the impact of a sudden or uncontrolled fall, the dollar decline has good and bad effects. It is costly for Americans traveling abroad: trips to Europe now can cost 13 percent more than four months ago. The fall can also increase inflation by making imports more expensive, but that is less of a threat with the American economy growing so slowly.
On the other hand, a weak dollar can make American products more competitive abroad. Mr. Bush highlighted exports in his acceptance speech, because if more foreigners buy American goods, more Americans will be employed producing them.

HEADLINE: $113 Million Is Estimated As a Surplus

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 21

 BODY:
Connecticut will close the books on its first fiscal year with a state income tax with a surplus of almost $113 million in its $8 billion budget, according to an estimate from the Legislature's budget office.
The projection was released late Thursday, only two days before the one-year anniversary of the income tax law on Saturday, and it prompted angry denunciations all over again by tax opponents who said it only proved their assertion that the state was worsening the recession by taking too much money out of residents' wallets. Last month, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. predicted a surplus of only $30 million; four months ago, the surplus was expected to come in at $100,000. 
 "This just shows that taxpayers were overtaxed," said the House minority leader, Representative Edward C. Krawiecki Jr., a Republican from Bristol.
Most of the surplus, however, did not arise from collecting too much in income taxes. The director of the General Assembly's Office of Fiscal Analysis, Ralph J. Caruso, said that income tax collections had actually come in $57 million less than predicted for the year that ended June 30. Sales tax collections were also down, coming in $31.5 million less than predicted, Mr. Caruso said.
He said the surplus was mainly due to a windfall of more than $100 million in Federal grant money that was applied for during the fiscal year, but not planned on when the budget bill was signed a year ago.
Under state law, the surplus must be used to make an accelerated payment on the $966 million in loans taken out by the state government last year to pay for two years of accumulated deficits.
The State Comptroller, William E. Curry Jr., whose office will issue its final report next week closing the books on year one of the income tax, said his numbers generally agreed with the Legislature's.
Shortly after Mr. Weicker announced last month that Connecticut would show its first surplus in five years, Mr. Curry said he was investigating whether the Department of Revenue Services -- the administration's tax arm -- had deliberately held back some tax refund checks until after the start of the fiscal year to "pad" the surplus.
Mr. Curry said in an interview today that his office would release its final report on that issue next week, along with a final word on the total value of the checks held over.
Preliminary reports said that perhaps $10 million to $12 million in refunds had been held up, and Mr. Curry said the total had in fact been "over that," though he declined to provide specifics. Officials at the tax department have said that larger refunds are routinely held to recheck the math, and such in-house audits accounted for the fiscal-year deadline slipping past.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
CLINTON SAYS BUSH IS UNTRUSTWORTHY ON JOBS AND TAXES

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 21

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton accused President Bush today of using lies and distortions to sidestep responsibility for the nation's economic woes and to paint the Democratic opposition as unworthy of public trust.
Mr. Clinton, who saw his once-commanding lead in public opinion surveys shrink as the Republican convention took center stage this week, used today's speech and remarks afterward to direct his sharpest criticism yet at Mr. Bush and to try to recapture the public's attention from the Republicans. 
 "Last night we heard a desperate candidate for President promise another short-term capital-gains tax cut for the rich, the fool's gold of an across-the-board tax cut in the face of a $400 billion deficit, and a balanced-budget amendment with no serious proposal to balance the budget," he said. "These promises are false, and they too will betray us, if we follow them."
 
Bush Called 'Untrustworthy'
 Mr. Clinton's assessment grew even more harsh when he responded to reporters' questions immediately after the speech to the Detroit Economic Club. He said that voters should consider the President "personally untrustworthy" because he broke his promise not to raise taxes and did not create the 15 million new jobs he promised in his 1988 Republican campaign.
"It was appalling to me that a man that has the Presidency of the United States is so desperate to hold onto his job that he would say something that absolutely flew in the face of the plain truth," he said of the President's as sessment of Mr. Clinton's own record.
"He didn't tell the truth last night about my tax record or his," Mr. Clinton said. "He didn't tell the truth last night about my tax proposals."
The Democratic nominee used the speech, which had been billed as a major address on the economy, to mount a new phase of his campaign. Now that the Republican convention has concluded, Mr. Clinton plans to hurry to remind voters of the problems he will hold the President responsible for during the final months of the campaign.
 
Comparing Records
 By turning around Mr. Bush's discussion of trustworthiness and returning the debate to the troubled economy, the Democrats also hope to undermine Republican efforts to raise character questions about Mr. Clinton.
"We've heard it all before," the Arkansas Governor said. "We've seen it all before. We've tried it all before. It's read-my-lips all over again, except this time we can read the record."
The President's speech, he said, relied on twisting the facts about Mr. Clinton's record in Arkansas and personal background to turn the political debate into an ill-defined discussion of family values instead of one about the state of the economy.
"He is a great fearmonger," Mr. Clinton said of the President. "That's what they're good at. That's what they know to do. 'If you're not with us, you're not American' -- all that kind of stuff. That's what they're good at. I tell you this. The American people are not going to let this country continue to go in the wrong direction. They cannot believe that he is totally free of responsibility."
Mr. Clinton said his economic plan was more far-reaching than anything Mr. Bush had proposed. He said he would cut the deficit in half within four years, create tax credits to help the development of new technologies and to aid the working poor, and create a new college scholarship and apprenticeship programs.
"I do believe people should take responsibility for their actions," said Mr. Clinton, who has often said his economic plan would create more opportunity but require greater individual responsibility in return. "And that includes the President of the United States."
Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore, and their wives will leave Ohio this weekend for a three-state bus tour, on which they are expected to use their most effective strategy to try to regain some of the popularity they enjoyed before the Republicans' convention.
 
Attacks Both Ways
 Each side used the phrase "smoke screen" to assail the other's strategy today. Torie Clarke, the press secretary for the Bush-Quayle campaign, said that Mr. Clinton "has got the political conscience of a weather vane."
The Republicans have said that Mr. Clinton has offered conflicting versions of his stand on abortion and his record of military service.
But Mr. Clinton said Mr. Bush's conflicts are more fundamental and affect the lives of all Americans.
"The test of Presidential character is whether we use the power of this office to help the American people realize their potential," he said. "The test of family values is not whether Al Gore and I love our wives and children as much as George Bush and Dan Quayle do, but whether we get up every day worrying about your children and your future."
Mr. Clinton dismissed Mr. Bush's plan for an across-the-board tax cut that would be offset by spending cuts and another proposal to reduce the deficit by allowing taxpayers to make voluntary contributions as "campaign fantasies."
"Three years and seven months into his Presidency, George Bush still has no agenda, no strategy, no vision -- nothing to say about creating jobs in America," Mr. Clinton said.
 
Address to Black Journalists
 At an earlier address today to the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists, Mr. Clinton faulted Mr. Bush for blaming Congress for his Administration's failures. The nation, he said, had become "decidedly more unequal" and had been hobbled by flawed economic theories promoted by Republican leaders.
"The thing that's holding us back today is the blinders that are on so many people who have had their heads filled up so long with all this supply-side, trickle-down rhetoric," he said.
Mr. Clinton also took specific aim at elements of the President's acceptance speech. He disputed Mr. Bush's assertion that he had raised taxes 128 times in Arkansas during his 11 years in office. By the yardstick the Republicans used to reach that total -- including routine increases in fees and surcharges, in addition to tax increases -- Mr. Bush had raised Federal taxes 78 times in three years, Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Clinton also said that Mr. Bush's efforts to blame Congress for budgets that increased the deficit was off the mark because, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the budgets Mr. Bush sent to Congress would have increased the deficit by $1 billion.
"This is something I want to read in every article about this from now on," Mr. Clinton told the journalists.
Mr. Clinton also defended his record on welfare restructuring and improving graduation rates in his home state.
Mr. Bush, he said, wanted to take "credit for every victory around the world" but take no responsibility for the problems created by a flagging economy.
"Of all the whoppers George Bush tried to get away with in his speech last night, the biggest one wasn't even about me," Mr. Clinton said. "It came at the end, when this President compared himself to Harry Truman. Harry Truman had a sign on his desk in the Oval Office that said, 'The buck stops here.' If George Bush had a sign on his desk, it would say, 'Don't blame me. I'm just the President."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Wives Are Defended
 CLEVELAND, Aug. 21 (Special to The New York Times) -- In Cleveland, speaking to 5,000 people who had gathered in the heart of the business district for a late afternoon rally, Mr. Clinton fairly shouted out a defense of his wife, Hillary, and his running mate's wife, Tipper.
"Did you believe it?" he asked the cheering, partisan crowd, referring to repeated references Thursday night by Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle to traditional American values and to scornful Republican references to Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Gore throughout the Houston convention.
"They said that the election was about family values," he continued. "When Tipper Gore was leading a national effort to get the record companies of this country to voluntarily label their music, they thought she was great. She didn't become the enemy of family values until she wanted to kick them out of the White House.
"When my wife was helping cut the infant mortality rate in our state and in our region by half, sticking up for the kids of this country, Mrs. Bush wrote a book and bragged about Hillary. She didn't become an enemy of the family until she wanted to kick George Bush out of the White House for sticking it to the American family.
"Family values? Give me a break!"
Then Mr. Clinton accused Mr. Bush of bending the truth of campaign rhetoric more than any other President in the past half century or so.
"Last night, for the first time in my lifetime," he said, "a President of the United States stood before the American people and said things about his opponent that he knew were downright false, that he had been called on repeatedly. But he said them anyway."

Bill Clinton today, but the newly renominated Mr. Bush also confronted the sudden re-emergence of a split between men and women in support of his ticket, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
The poll, taken overnight among 500 registered voters, seemed to put the Presidential race in a virtual dead heat, although the results were considered somewhat less reliable than most polls that question more people and last several days. 
 As the race ended the nominating phase and moved into a head-to-head contest that will include as many as three Presidential debates, Mr. Bush left Houston today for a three-day Southern campaign swing sounding combative.
"They say Clinton has a good reaction squad," he shouted at a final rally here before heading off to Mississippi to resume his attack on Mr. Clinton and the Democrats in Congress. "We're going to give them plenty to react to, every single minute."[Page 8.]
Mr. Bush clearly got some of what he had wanted from his convention. The new poll showed Mr. Clinton ahead of Mr. Bush by 45 percent to 42 percent, compared with his lead of 52 percent to 35 percent before the convention. The margin of sampling error in the nationwide telephone poll last night was plus or minus five percentage points.
At 14 points, Mr. Bush's post-convention surge, significantly smaller than Mr. Clinton's own 24-point boost after his convention, was about average for a Presidential candidate, according to a historical analysis provided by the Gallup Organization.
 
Gender Gap Growing
 Both sides said that the results of polls like this one, conducted immediately after a dramatic event, can be fleeting. And there were several warning signs for the President's re-election team that tempered the results. One that suddenly re-emerged after disappearing following the Democratic convention in July was the gap between men and women voters: women favored Mr. Clinton over Mr. Bush by a significant margin, while men were shifting to Mr. Bush by a smaller margin.
Although Mr. Bush's all-but-inevitable post-convention bounce was somewhat larger than had been expected, his low job-performance ratings remained virtually unchanged. His overall image was somewhat improved, but on balance, voters still said they had an unfavorable opinion of him.
 
No Impact on Congress
 After four days in which the Republicans suggested that working mothers made the wrong choice, demanded a ban on abortion and launched a strong personal attack on Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, the number of Americans who said Mr. Bush was mostly on the attack and not explaining his positions increased.
And despite the heavy focus on attacking Congress at the Republican convention, voters did not indicate any change in whom they planned to vote for, with the Democrats slightly favored. When asked whom they would vote for in their House district, without reference to names on any ballot, 43 percent said they would vote for the Democratic candidate; 37 percent said they would vote for the Republican.
But the poll also showed that voters' views of Mr. Clinton had shifted from positive to slightly negative. After four days of Mr. Clinton's punching back at Mr. Bush from outside the convention, the number who thought Mr. Clinton was doing more attacking than talking about his own positions had risen slightly, although most still said he was primarily promoting his own ideas.
Mr. Bush made clear in a farewell talk to party leaders here today that he did not intend to slow his assault on Mr. Clinton.
In an unusually blunt preview of his fall campaign strategy, Mr. Bush announced that he also planned to step up his assault on Congress by traveling to Congressional districts and attacking individual lawmakers. That strategy, used by Harry S. Truman in 1948 and by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940, carries the risk of making Mr. Bush appear even more negative in his campaigning.
Campaign strategists said that Mr. Bush's targets would include Democratic leaders and the 12 Democrats who had co-sponsored a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget, which Mr. Bush supports, and then voted against the measure on the House floor this summer.
 
Guilt by Association
 Mr. Bush said his goal would be to link Mr. Clinton with Congress in voters' minds and to tar the Democrat with the scandals and mismanagement on Capitol Hill. "Let them try to sever that umbilical cord," Mr. Bush said, chopping at the air with his hands.
The President's campaign strategists were heartened by the polls and by his decision to include economic proposals, however vague, in his acceptance speech after months of indecision and inaction at the White House.
"That gives us something to run on the rest of the way that provides the most dramatic contrast with Clinton," Charles Black, a senior campaign strategist, said as the Bush team headed back to Washington to prepare for Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to take over the White House staff and the campaign operation on Monday.
"It's clear we seized momentum at this convention and that we've made this a competitive race," Mr. Black said.
But he tried to temper his enthusiasm, given the expectation in the Bush and Clinton camps that Mr. Bush may slip back in the polls a bit, perhaps as early as this weekend, as the glow of the convention fades.
In 1980, when President Jimmy Carter's handling of the economy had the same low approval among voters as Mr. Bush's performance, the race between Mr. Carter and Ronald Reagan also was in a dead heat after the incumbent Democrat's convention.
"The convention reminds people of the differences between Republicans and Democrats, and what they like about having Republicans in the White House, and what makes them hesitant about having Democrats in the White House," Mr. Black said. "But the personal numbers are something entirely different."
The Clinton campaign's internal polling also reflected Mr. Bush's surge from the convention, Clinton aides said. But the Democrats took heart from other findings that suggested, as the New York Times/CBS News poll did, that voters still give Mr. Bush's performance poor reviews.
Only 40 percent of those surveyed said they approved of the way Mr. Bush had handled his job, essentially unchanged from 38 percent who held that opinion in a poll taken before the convention.
"Bush may have helped himself in the short run, but he's left himself with a lot of long-term vulnerabilities," said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director. "His job-performance rating is still low."
In the last three Presidential elections, the Republican candidate has won despite having considerably less support among women than among men. But this is the year of family values, and Republican and Democratic strategists alike suggested that Mr. Bush was feeling the effects of the convention's offensive on that front. At times, that offensive turned into a biting assault on the lives led by Mr. Clinton and his wife, who did not give up her legal career when she had a child.
Throughout the campaign, there has been no consistent difference in support for Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton among men and women. After the Democratic convention in July, public opinion polls showed no split between the sexes.
But the new poll showed that men now say they favor Mr. Bush over Mr. Clinton by 47 percent to 40 percent, while women favor Mr. Clinton by 49 percent to 37 percent.
The re-emergence of a gap between men and women was due almost entirely to a shift by men toward Mr. Bush. Before the Republican convention, men gave Mr. Clinton a 19-point margin of support, while women similarly gave him a 15-point margin. But in Thursday's polling men had shifted to give Mr. Bush a 7-point margin, while women had remained with Mr. Clinton by a 12-point margin.
Although attacks on homosexuals emerged as a central part of the family-values theme at the convention, the poll results suggest that the Republicans may have a hard time using that in the campaign. While 50 percent of adults said homosexuality should not be considered an acceptable way of life, 79 percent said in a separate question that homosexuals should have equal rights in terms of job opportunities.
 
On to the Debates
 Two other national polls that included interviewing on Thursday also showed a tightening contest, although to a lesser degree. An ABC News poll of 469 likely voters surveyed on Thursday showed a 9-point Clinton lead. A Gallup Poll for CNN and USA Today taken Wednesday and Thursday, based on 801 registered voters, showed a 12-point Clinton advantage. Each result was narrower than the respective polling organization's pre-convention sounding.
With the conventions behind them, the next major milestone the candidates are facing is the debates. Mr. Bush has accepted Mr. Clinton's challenge for the traditional debates, but he has not formally agreed to dates or conditions for the encounters.
The Commission on Presidential Debates, an unofficial bipartisan group that sponsored the 1988 campaign debates, has proposed three 90-minute, nationally televised Presidential debates and one Vice-Presidential debate this year. The group wants to replace the familiar panel of journalists with one moderator to encourage give-and-take between the candidates.
How the Poll Was Conducted
 
 
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Thursday evening with 656 adults around the United States, exclud ing Alaska and Hawaii, of whom 500 said they were registered voters.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its popu lation. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers werethen screened so that calls would be placed to residences only. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll.
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relat ing to region, race, sex, age and educa tion.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than five percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all regis tered voters in the country.
The potential sampling error for small er subgroups is larger. For example, for results based on men it is plus or minus seven percentage points, while for wom en it is six percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the prac tical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. And polls conducted in just one night can be subject to further error because of the limited time available to call back respondents who are difficult to reach.

Hoping Tourists Will Say Sayonara

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRNS, Australia

 BODY:
Capt. James Cook discovered the endless beaches and dense rain forests here along the Great Barrier Reef in 1770. The Japanese rediscovered them sometime in the late 1980's, and that, the locals say, is when everything began to change.
On the main street of this once isolated town, advertisements are in both English and Japanese. With Japan's offices emptying for August, the glass-bottomed tour boats bobbing up and down over the reef are filled with what the Australians call "YOL's," the "young office ladies" who fly in from Tokyo to ooh and ahhh at the tropical fish below. 
 And as recession has gripped most of Australia, the region of Queensland that stretches from the glitzy hotels of the Gold Coast to the blue-green waters of the reef has become a comparatively prosperous object of envy.
 
A Whiff of Extortion
 Nonetheless, Lionel Van Dorssen and his fellow retailers in Cairns say they are not happy. Just behind the waves of tourists, they contend, came a wave of Japanese businesses that bought up a startling number of the best hotels and golf courses and staffed many of them with Japanese.
Then Japanese tour operators visited the stores and demanded big commissions -- 20 or 30 percent of the sales they generate -- for bring busloads of tourists to the front door.
"What's getting up the noses of everyone in town," said Mr. Van Dorssen, a former member of the town council, "is that Japanese tourists are here for three or four days, and unless you've been willing to pay the price, you never see them."
What triggered all this, of course, was something the residents of the reef could not have anticipated: For many Japanese, Hawaii has become a bit passe. Young Japanese in Tokyo complain that the beaches of Honolulu, the No. 1 destination for Japanese tourists, are now far too crowded with their compatriots.
 
Some Unhappy Memories
 The barrier reef is an alluring alternative, only six and a half hours from Tokyo, plenty of sand and golf courses, a carefully nurtured frontier image and -- best of all for weary office workers on a six-day holiday -- no jet lag.
Last year more than a half million Japanese visited Australia, including nearly a quarter of all of Japan's honeymooners. That is twice the number of Americans.
But if the arrival of jumbo jets full of infinitely polite tourists eager to spend heavily once seemed like an easier form of gold prospecting, it has turned out to be considerably more complicated. Throughout Australia, particularly in a conservative corner like this where some people are eager to remind visitors of the Japanese bombing of Darwin a half-century ago, Japan periodically crops up as a political football.
 
Investment Withers
 Two years ago a plan to build a major new high-tech city outside of Adelaide became an emotional issue in the federal elections. Critics said the plan, developed by Japan's Ministry for International Trade and Industry, was the first step in a Japanese takeover of Australia.
(Now the complaint is the opposite. Hit by a recession back home, the biggest worry is that the Japanese will abandon the project.)
With elections approaching, the current question is how to deal with giant tour buses like the one that pulled up the other day in front of Bentines. The neon-lit store is staffed almost entirely by Japanese who push Australian opals, Crocodile Dundee-style hats and toy koalas.
"Be very careful in this town," a young Japanese tour guide told her wards as they disembarked, to glares from some nearby storekeepers. The stores she was leading them to, she said, all had offices in Tokyo to deal with any returned goods, and they knew how demanding Japanese customers can be. "Other stores may not be as reliable," she said. "You should be very, very careful."
 
Who Guides the Guides?
 With emotions already high, another Japanese tour company wandered into trouble a few weeks ago when it asked permission to bring in 2,000 Japanese tour guides over the next three years. So many Japanese tourists are pouring into the country, they said, particularly older people with little or no English, that the meager language skills of the local tourist industry were being overwhelmed.
Queenslanders saw it differently. If Japanese tourists wanted to pet fuzzy hopping animals or dive the reef, they said with typical national directness, they should do it with Australian guides, drawn from the 30 percent of young people who the Government says are unemployed.
But even with 90,000 Australian students now learning Japanese, the Government has little sympathy for the complaints of the Queenslanders. "They are biting the hand that feeds them," said Richard Woolcott, one of the country's top diplomats.
Perhaps surprisingly, the Australians get a more sympathetic hearing at the Japanese Embassy. Fearful that the bus tours give Japan a bad image, Japan's Foreign Ministry has been encouraging more young people to travel independently, out of the reach of the Tokyo tour operators.
"Their No. 1 complaint," said Yasukuni Enoki, the embassy's senior political officer, "is that when they go out on the streets of Sydney or walk along the beach, they see too many Japanese."

Markets
The dollar plunged to record lows against the German mark. The decline dragged down the American bond and stock markets and raised fears of economic disruptions both in the United States and Europe. The slide, attributed to the weak economy and more attractive interest rates abroad, is an unwelcome development for President Bush, who has asked voters to trust him as the better steward of the nation's economy. [Page 1.]
Stock prices plunged as a falling dollar and worries that an economic recovery would be stifled by higher interest rates set off a wave of computer-driven sell programs. The Dow fell 50.79, or 1.5 percent, to 3,254.10, its lowest close in four months. [36.] 
 Treasury bond prices sank as the dollar's fall ended a rally the bond market had been staging in response to President Bush's acceptance speech Thursday night. [36.]
The dollar's plunge came despite the intervention of 16 central banks to support it. [42.]
Grain and soybean futures settled higher in quiet trading. [42.]
 
 International
Japan's stock market staged a spectacular rally this week, following heavy Government intervention to stabilize the nation's faltering financial system. Still, many analysts doubted the rally would be sustained or that the economy was really regaining its footing. They attributed the market's gains to what is known as short-covering, quick purchases to replace borrowed stock, rather than to a long-term surge in demand. [34.]
 
The Economy
Customs duties on imports from China of up to 100 percent on $3.9 billion worth of goods were threatened by the Bush Administration unless China opened its markets to American goods. [33.]
The President's idea to force the Government to spend less by allowing the public to earmark tax payments for debt reduction implies spending cuts far more severe than are politically feasible, various budget analysts said. [33.]
 
Companies
An advertising agency can be culpable for false claims, a Federal judge ruled. She decided that Friedman Benjamin Inc., which wrote razor blade ads for Wilkinson Sword, was just as liable as the blade maker and should share responsibility for $953,000 in damages that she ordered paid to Gillette. [33.]
Efforts to reorganize T.W.A. so it can emerge from bankruptcy were said to be progressing. Carl C. Icahn, the airline's chairman, and its creditors have made major concessions to make the carrier's pension fund viable and to guarantee jobs for its pilots, people involved in the talks said. [33.]
Honeywell settled patent infringement cases with seven camera makers that it had accused of using its patented technology for autofocus lenses. It will be paid more than $124 million. The agreements were negotiated separately with Canon Inc., the Eastman Kodak Company, Konica, the Kyocera Corporation, Matsushita, Nikon and Premier. [35.]
Travelers plans loss insurance for theft of telephone services, which occurs when criminals tap into certain corporate telephone systems and steal long-distance calls. Most industry consultants agree that annual costs from all types of telephone fraud might exceed $2.2 billion. [35.]
 
Today's Columns
An Administration effort to simplify depositing payroll withholding taxes for small business has come under an unforeseen barrage of criticism from small-business advocates in industry, in Congress and within the Administration itself. Everyone agrees the notoriously complex regulations need changing, however. John H. Cushman Jr.: Your Taxes. [34.]
A microwave camera was patented to allow pilots to peer through fog and see the runway. It was invented at the Thermotrex Corporation, a military electronics company based in San Diego. Edmund L. Andrews: Patents. [34.]

 NEW YORK CITY
 
 WILLIAMSBURG DUSTED
WITH LEAD PAINT
A painting crew sandblasting the Williamsburg Bridge repeatedly rained sand, dust and lead-paint chips into Brooklyn earlier this summer before city officials suspended the project under pressure from the state. The maintenance of the aging bridge has been halted for more than a month, and in the community beneath it, residents are anxious about findings of "elevated"' and potentially dangerous levels of lead in dust around the bridge. Page 1.
 
 A REPRIEVE FOR COUNCIL PRESIDENT
Mayor Dinkins and the City Council agree that the office of City Council President should be abolished. They just can't agree how to do it. An effort to put a referendum on the November ballot that would abolish the office failed because Council leaders and the administration could not agree on the details. Page 25.
 
 POLICE SHOOTING CALLED JUSTIFIED
A police detective who fatally shot a robbery suspect in May, sparking angry demonstrations in Brooklyn, will not be prosecuted. District Attorney Charles J. Hynes said, "There is no evidence that the police conduct in this incident was anything but justified." A spokesman for Mr. Hynes said the office had been unable to find anyone who disputed the police account and that the shooting was so clearly justified that the case was not presented to a grand jury.

Connecticut will close the books on its first fiscal year with a state income tax with a surplus of almost $113 million, according to an estimate from the legislature's budget office. The projection was released only two days before the one-year anniversary of the income-tax law, prompting angry denunciations all over again by tax opponents who said it only proved that the state was worsening the recession by taking too much money from residents.

 CUOMO RESPONDS TO BUSH CRITICISM
Lest anyone misinterpret President Bush's convention-speech swipe at Mario M. Cuomo as a throwaway line, the New York Governor charged today that the Republicans were using him and his state to reinforce the country's ethnic and racial prejudices. Page 26.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: With the Convention Over, Americans Pause to Talk Politics;
In a Reagan Democrat Area, Signs of Unease Over Bush

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARDEN GROVE, Calif., Aug. 21

 BODY:
If President Bush is to be re-elected he must retain the Reagan Democrats who deserted their party in the 1980's. And here, deep in the heart of Reagan Democrat country, in northern Orange County suburbs hit hard by the recession, it is anything but certain that he can do so.
"He's out of touch," said Pat Kinda, a housewife preparing dinner on Thursday evening as the President prepared to accept the Republican nomination in Houston. She said she had eagerly voted for Ronald Reagan, and less eagerly for George Bush four years ago. 
 "He's a nice guy, but he and Barbara were raised rich," she said, explaining why she, long a registered Democrat, would not vote Republican this year. "They have no idea how people live. We feel helpless."
On Election Day, Mrs. Kinda said, she and her husband, Joe, who runs a silk-screen business, will vote neither for Mr. Bush nor his Democratic rival, Bill Clinton ("He'd give the store away"), but for Ross Perot, writing in his name if necessary.
 
Unease and Unhappiness
 Mrs. Kinda's voice reflected the political unease and unhappiness flowing through blue-collar Democratic precincts in northern Orange County cities that voted heavily for Mr. Reagan in the booming 1980's, but now, with this corner of Reagan Country particularly hard hit by the troubled economy, the Republican message on abortion and "family values" falls flat.
"These are working-class people and they are the first to get laid off," said George T. Urch, chief of staff to Tom Umberg, the State Assemblyman who represents Garden Grove in Sacramento. "During the last recession we were insulated. But this time we have not been insulated at all."
Mr. Umberg's constituents are mostly people who migrated to California from the Midwest, seeking a better life and finding it in lush Orange County. But now they see it all threatened by a slumping economy, by factory layoffs and, increasingly, by foreign immigration.
Out of disgust for what they saw as the liberal drift of the Democratic Party, they have voted overwhelmingly Republican in the last three Presidential elections.
Even Mr. Umberg's wife, Robin, who described herself as a conservative on military and economic issues, voted for Mr. Reagan in 1980 and 1984, and stuck with Mr. Bush four years ago.
But not this year. "Friends of my children are having terrible hardships," she said. "I am really worried what is happening to families and homes. The cold war is over. Now we need to look at domestic issues. Bush has had his chance."
If the Republicans had hoped that their stand against abortion and the "family values" issue would help keep Reagan Democrats, there was little sign of that in door-to-door interviews with registered Demorats in two precincts here in the hours before Mr. Bush's speech on Thursday.
The President still has some friends in Leonard and Kathleen Kackley, who live in the Fairlane mobile home park and drifted away from their Democratic roots to vote for Mr. Reagan.
Mr. Kackley, a 73-year-old retired school custodian, said he would vote for Mr. Bush again ("I don't think Clinton's got the experience"), but was not impressed with the President's stand on abortion. "I think a woman should have a right to choose," he said.
The family values theme had at least some resonance with Mrs. Kackley, who complained about excessive sexuality in the media, including images of scantily clad women. Asked if he shared such concerns, her husband said, "No, I don't object -- at my age I've got a right to look."
After the President's speech Mrs. Kackley said she generally liked the message. On the economy and Mr. Bush's efforts to end the recession, she said: "I feel like he knows what's going on and would pull us out of it. But you hear people saying, 'You know how Republicans are.' So, I don't know."
Not far away, Robert and Anita Milhollin were holding a garage sale. Mr. Milhollin is a registered Republican, but he talked like a Reagan Democrat. A contractor, he said he had not worked for nine months and is beginning to have trouble making ends meet.
He said he is now ready to go Democratic. "I know quite a few people who've been in their homes for 10 or 15 years who are out of work and are losing their homes," he said.
Then he erupted with a complaint that is common among longtime residents who resent the influx of Vietnamese and Korean immigrants.
"Reagan let in a lot of boat people and gave them carte blanche to buy property up," he said, voice rising. "Now we have Little Saigon here. If you're going to live here, then get away from this Little Saigon, speak English. We're all Americans. We don't have a Dutchtown for me."
Family values? "Bunch of bull-harkey."
Abortion? "I have no right to tell people what to do."

HEADLINE: Black Journalists Tell of Facing New Job Pressures

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 21

 BODY:
Reporters and editors who gathered here for a convention of the National Association of Black Journalists said the Los Angeles riots highlighted both the growing opportunities for blacks in the field and the problem of balancing questions of profession and race.
Indeed, many black reporters, editors and producers say they face mounting job pressures and complexities that they never anticipated, stemming from their emergence into newsrooms, radio stations and television stations that are still dominated largely by whites who have little familiarity with issues that concern blacks. 
 About 1,300 journalists, a number that is down from previous years partly because many black journalists were covering the Republican convention in Houston, attended the association's 17th annual convention, which began Wednesday and ends Sunday.
A report by the organization on news coverage of the Los Angeles riots concluded that "many black reporters believe they were assigned to the story primarily because they are black." The report cited complaints from many that they were not allowed to write important news articles.
 
Flattering Coverage Expected
 Black reporters often say they want to use their jobs to redress negative stereotypes or to focus attention on problems that they believe have been covered by the press inadequately.
However, they say, white supervisors may oppose or fail to understand their ideas. At the same time, black groups or individuals may expect flattering coverage from the reporter, based on common heritage.
"I was constantly harassed by a black mayor who perceived that me and my staff were too harsh," said Vernon Smith, now an assistant managing editor of The Dallas Morning News. "There is an unwritten rule that black journalists are supposed to look after their own."
Another type of pressure from black politicians was typified by remarks by Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan. Addressing a seminar on Wednesday, Mr. Conyers exhorted the journalists, many of whom have had to struggle to get their jobs, "not to fear endangering your careers or getting yourselves fired."
Amplifying his remarks later, Mr. Conyers, who is black, said, "We need activists in journalism" who will "challenge managerial practices."
 
Fairness and Balance
 More often, however, looking after one's own involves addressing issues of fairness and balance.
Michael Ottey, a reporter with The Asbury Park Press in New Jersey, told editors he was offended by a spate of photographs in the newspaper showing black male suspects being led away in handcuffs. "Somehow, whenever a white person was arrested they seemed to dig up his graduation picture for the newspaper," he said.
After a survey of their coverage the editors concluded that Mr. Ottey's objection was valid, said Fred Kerr, the paper's managing editor for news, and wrote a memorandum "to treat these subjects with consistent neutrality with regard to anything that perpetuates racial stereotypes."
In covering the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Jeff Rivers, an associate editor of The Hartford Courant, said, "There were expectations that they could confide in me."
A journalist "must not cross over the line" between objectivity and participation, he said. "Some black organizations have an idea that you will look out for them, so your stories result in disappointment."
Garry Pierre-Pierre, a Haitian-American reporter for The Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) Sun Sentinel, said he believed his choice of story subjects by itself constituted activism. "If I don't do them, who will?" he asked.
But a black reporter who favors stories that deal with issues of economic or social justice may "get pigeon-holed," said Jason Johnson, a reporter with The Dallas Morning News. "It's the price you pay, but otherwise they won't get done very well."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Watch;
View From the Booth: A Faulty Bush Speech

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
It was George Bush's moment to speak directly to the American people.
With the cameras focused mercilessly close in, he looked confident and determined. He spoke forcefully. And he had a bad word to say for just about everyone: Congressional leaders, Bill Clinton, Mario Cuomo, yes, even the King. 
 "I guess you'd say his plan is really 'Elvis economics,' " the President said, referring to Governor Clinton's proposals. "America will be checking into the 'Heartbreak Hotel.' "
Accusing one's opponents of "voodoo economics" is one thing; slighting Elvis is another. But this year, it seems, nothing is off limits, not even cultural icons. And if there was one clear message that viewers took away from the final night of the Republican convention it was that this campaign is likely to set records for nastiness.
"Elvis, of course, is Bill Clinton's patron saint," Andrea Mitchell said Friday morning on the NBC News program "Today." "That was really a low blow."
 
'Laundry List'
 All week long, newscasters, television commentators and even Republican officials had been billing the President's acceptance speech as his last, best hope to explain why he shouldn't lose his job. Mr. Bush's task, they said, was to lay out a compelling vision for the future and clear plan for tackling the nation's domestic problems.
As it turned out, though, this was not the most propitious buildup for a speech that seemed to have contempt for the President's opponents as its only unifying theme.
On Friday morning news programs, the President's supporters tried to put a new spin on the speech, saying its real aim had been to draw the distinctions between the candidates. But most television commentators were less forgiving.
The President's speech, they said, was a disappointment. Several called it a "laundry list" of proposals left over from the President's State of the Union address.
"There was a shortage of new initiatives," said Charles Kuralt of CBS. "I wonder if the President helped himself enough."
"I'd give it a gentleman's 'C,' as they say at Yale," said Tim Russert of NBC. "It was a real missed opportunity."
 
Borrowed Jokes
 The sense that the Bush administration was short on new ideas was evident not just from its proposals, but also from its jokes. If some of the President and Vice President's one-liners seemed familiar to convention viewers, it was because they were. Some, in fact, had been borrowed from the Democrats.
In his acceptance speech, Vice President Dan Quayle twice repeated the refrain "It's time for them to go," a line lifted directly from Senator Al Gore, his Democratic opponent. Mr. Quayle used the line to refer to Democrats in Congress; Mr. Gore had used it to refer to you-know-who.
Mr. Quayle also offered his version of the "you're no Jack Kennedy" line that Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the Democratic candidate for Vice President in 1988, had used so effectively against him, and that former President Ronald Reagan had already recycled on Monday night. Mr. Quayle attacked Mr. Clinton for comparing himself to another Presidential candidate with a background only in state government by saying, "Bill Clinton, you're no Ronald Reagan."
As Tom Brokaw of NBC observed after Mr. Quayle tried the Bentsen line yet again: "They've probably worn that one out."
The Republicans, who had some trouble this year putting on the kind of grand spectacle for which they are famous, did manage to pull off one television coup Thursday night -- the largest balloon drop in convention history. But even here there were bumpy moments.
After the President's speech, tens of thousands balloons, some the size of medicine balls, rained down from the rafters of the Astrodome. Seen in a wide shot, the balloons formed vast, cascading ribbons of red, white and blue. But when the cameras focused in on Mr. and Mrs. Bush, viewers saw they were not just waving from the stage but struggling to fend off some of the enormous balloons that were bouncing off their heads.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: With the Convention Over, Americans Pause to Talk Politics;
If These Are Typical Voters, The President Is in Trouble

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIVER ROUGE, Mich., Aug. 21

 BODY:
Forget the polls and columnists and odds makers. If there are such things as typical voters, a Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer with the pulse of the electorate for all its rage and ambivalence, they are James and Bonnie Szalkie.
They are Midwestern Rust Belt, blue-collar Bush Democrats, ripe for Republican talk about family values and a strong America but on edge about the economy and an Administration they feel has lost touch with the Kmart crowd. 
 They are the kind of voters who can decide elections. For as long as they have been eligible to go to the polls, they have voted for the winner of each Presidential campaign: Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Reagan, Bush.
 
Shaking Their Heads
 Thursday night the Szalkies -- he is 50 years old, she is 49 -- sat in front of their television console, an auto worker and a homemaker in matching brown velour easy chairs, watching the man they last voted into the White House accept the Republican nomination for President and appeal once again for their vote.
As the grainy picture of George Bush pounding on the lectern flickered across the set, they yawned during the part about the end of the cold war, winced at the barbs at Bill Clinton and Mario M. Cuomo, and shook their heads when President Bush said the world economy was in transition, when they see recession.
"He still doesn't see how bad off this country is," Mr. Szalkie said. "I can't believe he's that blind."
Mrs. Szalkie looked into the distant face of a patrician President talking about things that mattered little to her and neared a boil. "He makes we want to reach out across the screen and grab him by the throat and say, 'Wake up, George,' " she said, lighting another cigarette. "I want him to talk about issues, not about other politicians. Forget Cuomo and all the rest."
The Szalkies live in a modest brick house on a narrow street lined with older Fords and pickup trucks in a factory town past its prime. They have watched steel mills and machine shops shut down around them in the last decade, the unemployment rate here hangs at 12 percent and their grown children struggle for jobs earning not much more than minimum wage.
As the economy has worsened, fluctuated and stalled, they have cut back on vacations and dinners out and the once-requisite new car every couple of years. Like many other voters, they have not lost a paycheck during the recent recession, but nonetheless they feel a vague sense of doom and vulnerability.
It is a discontent that goes deeper than the latest consumer index figures. It has to do with the feeling of disconnection from the party that they say seduced them in the 1980's and betrayed them in the 1990's.
Like an inamorata dumped by a suitor, Mrs. Szalkie says she can see through the Republicans and the promises of trickle-down prosperity. She says she has learned her lesson. "I don't care what the Republicans say," she said. "They're for the rich. I guess I'll never be rich, so to hell with them."
She has returned to her Democratic roots with gusto, sporting Clinton bumper stickers in front and back of the car. "Clinton would have to say he's a secret member of the Ku Klux Klan for me not to stick with him now," she said.
Mr. Szalkie has not made up his mind yet, finding the confetti and rhetoric of both parties' conventions more dizzying than enlightening. Like the American electorate, he is a bundle of contradictions. He loves the talk about family values -- although he is not quite certain what the term means -- but believes that women should have the right to an abortion. ("There's no way a man can decide abortion," he said. "They're men. They can't get pregnant.") He was angry that President Bush went back on his promise of no new taxes, but says he is certain that taxes must be raised to pare down the Federal budget deficit.
He turned off the television set on Thursday night disappointed.
"He let me down," Mr. Szalkie said. "He didn't commit himself to nothing. Not one thing did he commit himself to."
Mr. Szalkie did not like the finger-pointing at Congress and the name-calling aimed at the Democrats. "Slashing and slamming the Democrats, that's all he has going for him," Mr. Szalkie said. "It's sleazy. He should be above that."
This is not to say that Mr. Szalkie is sold on Governor Clinton, though. He worries that the Democratic nominee does not have enough foreign policy experience. But as impressed as the Szalkies are with President Bush's stature on the world stage, the President's lingering on the topic only reminded the Szalkies of the other thing that disappointed them about President Bush, the resolution of the Persian Gulf war.
"He was knocking on Saddam Hussein's front door," Mr. Szalkie said. "He should have taken him out when he had the chance."
Mrs. Szalkie chimed in, "That was his biggest mistake."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Ross Perot;
No New Plans? Read My Book, Perot Says

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

 BODY:
Like a nearly forgotten boomerang traveling a long, looping arc, Ross Perot, the Dallas billionaire, is trying to return to the Presidential race, if not as as candidate, then at least as an influence.
Since July 16 when he abruptly pulled out of the Presidential race, Mr. Perot has been financing a grass-roots organization called United We Stand, America that has continued to collect signatures on nominating petitions so that the Texas computer services magnate would qualify for the ballot in all 50 states. 
 Recently Mr. Perot gave a series of interviews with network news shows in which he continued to leave the door open -- a door that was never fully closed -- for his re-entry into the Presidential sweepstakes.
His new book, "United We Stand," went on sale yesterday. The book describes itself as a "plan for the 21st century" and provides specific recommendations to solve many of this country's most nettlesome economic and social problems. Aides to Mr. Perot say he hopes his volunteer network and his presence on the ballot will force President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton to address the issues and concerns laid out in his book.
 
'A Powerful Force'
 "He feels that he can effectively influence the debate," said Sharon Holman, Mr. Perot's press secretary. "He wants to influence the debate. The United We Stand volunteers can be a powerful force to do that. By staying together, and by his staying on the ballot, there is a great deal of leverage to do it."
The latest effort by Mr. Perot to inject himself into the Presidential campagn is a much more modest affair, compared with his last attempt. The Dallas headquarters from which the campaign is being directed occupies just a few rooms in the North Dallas office building that, in his previous attempt, had been just about taken over by Mr. Perot's campaign structure.
Aside from a few accountants and other experts needed to comply with reporting requirements for the Federal Elections Commission, Mr. Perot employs a skeleton staff. Longtime aides like Thomas W. Luce 3d and Morton Meyerson are not involved in Mr. Perot's latest effort. The telephone bank, which is staffed by a group of volunteers, has been reduced to 12 lines to handle incoming calls. At its height in Mr. Perot's abortive campaign, the telephone bank had 100 lines.
 
Offices in Every State
 Mr. Perot is also financing 64 offices in all 50 states to co-ordinate efforts to get him on the ballot and to support his nationwide volunteer force. Ms. Holman declined to say how much Mr. Perot is contributing to the effort.
Mr. Holman said that Mr. Perot is on the ballot in 36 states, and volunteers have turned in petitions in an additional 6 states and the District of Columbia that are awaiting certification. In another 8 states -- New York, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Arizona, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Vermont -- Mr. Perot's volunteers have not yet gathered enough signatures to place his name on the ballot.
In one state, New York, Mr. Perot has difficulty finding enough volunteers to get the job done, and is paying individuals $10 an hour to work in the petition drive. Ms. Holman said New York is the only state where people are being paid to help collect signatures.
While Mr. Perot is listed as the author of the 117-page book, it is actually the product of the research staff headed by John P. White, which developed positions for Mr. Perot in his campaign. Many of these positions have been reported before and some, like the line-item veto, have already been embraced by both Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton. Proceeds from the sale of the book will go to the United We Stand, America organization, Ms. Holman said.
 
Bold Departures Outlined
 Some of the recommendations represent a bold departure from the platform of both the Democratic and Republican parties. For example, Mr. Perot suggests cutting Federal discretionary spending by 15 per cent, eliminating such programs as the space station. He advocates the elimination of all farm subsidies for large agricultural corporations, cutting the tax deduction for business entertainment to 50 percent of its cost from the current 80 percent and scrapping some weapons systems like the B-2 bomber, and the Seawolf submarine.
Mr. Perot also proposes getting rid of the tax deduction for the amount of a home mortgage of more than $250,000 and raising the income tax rate for high income families and individuals to 33 per cent from the present 31 percent. He also advocates a 10-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline in each of the next five years and raising taxes on Social Security receipts for individuals who earn more than $25,000 and families earning more than $32,000.
Since income for retirees generally comes from investments like stocks and bonds, and it would take a rather large investment to earn such amounts, Mr. Perot estimates that his proposal would only affect about 18 percent of all retirees.
Mr. Perot's book, published by Hyperion Press, also contains a number of his folksy recommendations, particularly those concerning what he views as the imperiousness of Federal officials, that he made in his campaign speeches and interviews. For example, he suggests that top government officials be banned from using government airplanes. By making Federal officials fly on commercial airlines, Mr. Perot said, they would stay in touch with the average citizen.
"They should go out to the airport, get in line, lose their baggage, eat a bad meal, and stay in touch with how normal people live," he writes.
As he traveled about the country promoting his candidacy, Mr. Perot always flew in his private jet.

HEADLINE: Uncertainty in Connecticut G.O.P. Stronghold

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MILFORD, Conn., Aug. 21

 BODY:
This is the kind of town that looms large in the Republican vision of America. It has shady streets lined with white clapboard houses, a picturesque town green, and a fondness for self-history that reaches back to pilgrim days.
But the order of Milford masks the dramatic changes of the last few years. More women are working outside the home than ever before; many people have lost the jobs they had at local factories that once seemed so secure, and managing the requirements of a municipality -- from traffic to sewage -- has grown more difficult as revenues have fallen. 
 There seems to be an uncertainty here, about the future and about who would best lead the nation toward it, and this week's speeches and campaign promises from President Bush seem to have done little to dispel that, even in a town that has voted Republican in the last three Presidential elections.
 
Looking Elsewhere
 "It is all very superficial, the things that they're saying," said Marti Reed, a registered Republican who owns a gift shop on Broad Street here and who has been following the convention in the newspaper. "The issues are the economy and world peace. I really think that they've got to have some problem-solving." She described President Bush as "a very nice man" but added that she wasn't sure he was "powerful enough."
On Monday the President is scheduled to speak in Ansonia, a depressed manufacturing city just north of here. "I don't think he's going to be met with a lot of happy faces," Ms. Reed said.
Thursday night, as Mr. Bush delivered his hourlong acceptance speech, he failed to impress David Dyer, a lifelong Republican who lives in a beachfront community here and who had marched into City Hall earlier in the day to switch his party affiliation, a decision prompted, he said, by Patrick J. Buchanan's address on Monday.
"The Republicans are in denial," Mr. Dyer, a 41-year-old data-processing specialist, said as the President promised to preserve family values, cut taxes and oppose abortion. "It's like a family in denial. They refuse to see reality or deal in reality."
"The diehard Republicans are going to go crazy over anything he says," Mr. Dyer added, as placards fluttered on the television screen and the cameras showed delegates wearing elephant tattoos on their cheeks, sunglasses proclaiming "Bush-Quayle," and hats topped with cutouts of the President's grinning face. "But those that are standing on the fence, they want to hear some admission of wrongdoing and what he's going to be doing differently."
 
Worry in Community
 Milford's voters are a mixed lot. There are 8,298 registered Democrats, and 7,159 Republicans. Then there are 12,608 more voters who are unaffiliated, as well as 8 people who joined A Connecticut Party, the party established by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. when he campaigned as an independent two years ago. There are white-collar as well as blue-collar workers, some of whom commute to New York City every morning and others who drive to their jobs, some of them assembling ball-point pens, shavers and other products.
"Connecticut is still hurting very badly," said Kathy Lutz, the Democratic Town Chairman for Milford. "You listen to talk about things are better, but you just can't sell that story around here. Our real estate values are very, very depressed. Lower interest rates have made little or no difference. And people are worried about losing jobs or having their hours cut back.
 At Harrison's Hardware, a Milford institution for 85 years, the hard-pressed economy is seldom far from the minds of shoppers.
The President mentioned hardware stores specifically in his address, saying that if the Democrats recaptured the White House, such stores would display signs advising "Closed for despair." How did that impress workers in Harrison's?
"A place like this is probably a piece of Americana," said David Ryan, a salesman who described himself as a diehard Democrat. "The whole speech sounded like they were in the corner and they better watch out or they'll be ousted."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Opens Fall Campaign, Attacking

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRANSON, Mo., Aug. 21

 BODY:
Offering himself as the 1992 version of Harry S. Truman, President Bush today opened his general election drive in the former President's home state with a torrent of fighting words at Gov. Bill Clinton, Congress and the press.
At spirited rallies before flag-waving partisans at the water's edge in Gulfport, Miss., and then at a country-and-western theme park here in the Ozarks, Mr. Bush pronounced the Republican National Convention a success and said the race was already tightening. 
 But he devoted most of his oratory not to touting his own accomplishments or goals but to bitterly attacking the Governor of the state just south of here as espousing ideas that are "clear, present and dangerous." He also accused Mr. Clinton of "wishy-washy indecision" on the Persian Gulf war.
Except for the Presidential seal on the lecterns, Mr. Bush, his collar open, his sleeves rolled up, looked and sounded more like a challenger than a man who has occupied the White House for nearly four years. He spent more time ridiculing Mr. Clinton's economic policies than seeking support for the across-the-board tax cut that he proposed Thursday night but mentioned only in passing today.
 
Going to the People
 "Two weeks ago they were totally writing off the Bush-Quayle ticket, all those smart talking heads on television," Mr. Bush said as Vice President Quayle stood by his side in Gulfport, both sweating through their dress shirts in the stifling humidity. "But we are going to take it to the American people. We're going to the people with our message.
"For nine months," he continued as the crowd roared, "the Governor of Arkansas has been distorting my record. And I don't care what the polls say, I'm going to take this case to the American people like Truman did -- go against the Congress, go against the opponent, say what I'm for."
Arriving at another rally at the Silver Dollar City park in Branson, the Republican President again sought to shroud himself in the image of the Democratic son of Missouri who took on Congress in the 1948 campaign. "He was a big underdog and he fought back," Mr. Bush said. "And he wrapped another Governor challenging him right around the do-nothing Congress. I'm going to do the same thing with the Governor of Arkansas."
 
Gloom and Doom
 If Mr. Bush's vitriol today is any indication, voters are in store for a political season that will make the Truman race seem tame. Calling his stop in Gulfport "the first step into the future," Mr. Bush sought to build on the political lift from the Republican convention and, indeed, many of his passages today rang familiar to anyone who heard his speech Thursday night.
If anything, Mr. Bush's oratory today was even more pointed. After barely a night's sleep after the convention's closing gavel fell, Mr. Bush wasted no time in mocking those who predict he will not win re-election.
"We came down here to Houston with more dire predictions, more gloom-and-doom negativism than I've ever seen in my long, long time in the political arena or, indeed, the private arena," Mr. Bush said at a brief appearance with Mr. Quayle before the Republican National Committee as he was leaving Houston. "A lot of that is turning around," he said.
The day lacked the spontaneity of the the Clinton-Gore bus caravan after the Democratic National Convention; there were many empty seats at the party's send-off in Houston, and though the two rallies drew thousands of enthusiastic supporters, some campaign officials had predicted larger crowds.
There was no doubt, though, that the reception today -- where supporters repeatedly broke into chants of "four more years, four more years" -- was a welcome improvement over the first post-convention outing of Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle four years ago. It was then, at a stop at Mr. Quayle's hometown of Huntington, Ind., that thousands of supporters greeted the freshly-minted ticket, but caused a ruckus by turning on the press for a stream of reports questioning the Vice President's military record and, more broadly, his preparedness for the office. Mr. Quayle tried, rather unsuccessfully, to defend himself to reporters.
Today the campaign played it safe; there were no news conferences, and Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle parted ways in Mississippi. The crowds were almost all white, and in friendly Southern territory where campaign officials hope to shore up their political base before moving on to more contentious battleground states.
The coming days should bring continued brisk campaigning before receptive audiences. From here, Mr. Bush has scheduled stops in Georgia, Alabama and Texas on Saturday and Illinois on Sunday before returning to Washington. He leaves again on Monday for New Jersey and Connecticut.
Mr. Quayle is also expected to keep up a heavy pace on the road, and today he praised the President's acceptance speech and vowed to press on, speaking everywhere about family values.
"I'm going to say it again and again and again," the Vice President said this morning in Houston. "We will not back down from talking about traditional values."
 
The President's Crusade
 But it was Mr. Bush who dominated the day as he hammered away with sound bites he is sure to repeat over and over in what he calls his "crusade" in next 74 days:
The "gridlocked" Congress: "Throw them out with their PAC's, their privileges and their perks."
Bill Clinton: "Follow that old Elvis Presley song, Return to Sender."
Change: "This election isn't simply about change. It's about who do you trust to make the change work for you."
By the day's end, one thing was clear: this would-be Harry Truman has only begun to bash.

HEADLINE: Doubts Voiced on Bush Plan For Taxpayer to Cut Deficit

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21

 BODY:
The President's idea to force the Government to spend less by allowing the public to earmark tax payments for debt reduction implies spending cuts far more severe than are politically feasible, various budget analysts said today.
The proposal was thus seen as highly unlikely to get the necessary approval of Congress, particularly as currently dominated by Bush adversaries, these skeptics said. 
 "Politically, it represents a huge barrier for Democrats, certainly, and probably a good number of Republicans, to climb over," said Norman Ture, a Reagan Administration Treasury official who now heads the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation.
While some commentators dismissed the checkoff as a gimmick, there was little doubt that the plan, assuming enactment, would be an immensely powerful weapon against the growth of Government spending. Yet even maximum participation by the public would only restrain the growth of the national debt, not pare it back.
Under the plan, taxpayers would be able to specify that up to 10 percent of their tax payments be placed in a special trust fund. A similar checkoff already in effect allows designation of $1 to finance Presidential campaigns. With that checkoff, as with the one proposed, the amount of tax owed is not affected.
What carries the plan's potential beyond a meaningless bookkeeping entry is the companion requirement. "We need to make sure that Congress doesn't just turn around and borrow more money to spend more money," the President said in his speech. "So I will require that for every tax dollar set aside to cut the debt, the ceilings on spending will be cut by an equal amount."
In effect, each earmarked dollar would produce an across-the-board spending cut, an outcome that would indeed serve an Administration goal of empowering taxpayers.
These cuts of as much as $50 billion a year -- the Treasury collects about $500 billion from the individual income tax -- would be in addition to $293 billion in cuts over five years that the Administration proposes to achieve by capping entitlement programs.
To get even half the savings from entitlements, said Carol Cox Wait, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, "you'll still be testing the outer limits of people's tolerance for expenditure restraint." So, in her view, there would be little room for the additional cuts forced by the earmarking mechanism. Such cuts would be spread equally across four areas -- military, domestic, international and certain entitlements.
The Bush plan has its origins in Congress, where a similar proposal was put forward this summer by Representative Robert Walker of Pennsylvania and Senator Robert Smith of New Hampshire, both Republicans. Another one, pressed by Representative Charles E. Bennett, a Florida Democrat, would require taxpayers to supply extra money if they wanted to contribute to a deficit-reduction fund.
 
Raising Money
 The Treasury already has a program under which taxpayers can send extra money for debt reduction when filing their tax return, but this money -- $114,794 last year -- goes directly into general revenues.
Leon E. Panetta, a California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee, said today that the earmarking proposal would create a budget "nightmare," citing among other things "uncertainty" about what would be required.
"Rather than rolling the dice with the budget, the President should take the lead and work with the Congress to set new spending targets and deficit reduction goals, just as was done in 1990," Mr. Panetta said. "Deficit reduction is certainly necessary, but it should be accomplished in an orderly way that allows for advance planning and careful spending decisions."
 
Previous Opposition
 Representative Bennett today was circulating copies of testimony given in May by the Treasury's tax legislative counsel who said the department has "consistently opposed voluntary checkoffs to the tax return, regardless of how meritorious" the purpose, including Federal debt reduction.
"These types of well-intended and seemingly innocent proposals create complexity, confusion and administrative burdens," said Terrill A. Hyde, the Treasury lawyer.
A spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service said today that he foresaw little administrative difficulty, suggesting that the checkoff -- though not necessarily its instructions -- would add only one or two lines to the tax forms.

HEADLINE: Aid for the Rich, Not the Economy

 BODY:
George Bush's acceptance speech echoed the same theme as virtually every other Republican leader at the Houston convention: The problem with the economy is not President Bush's program but an obstinate Congress that refuses to go along. According to this argument, the difference between economic stagnation and growth is a matter of tax cuts proposed by Mr. Bush and rejected by Congressional Democrats.
The theme may make for effective sound bites. But it is nonetheless absurd. The tax cuts proposed by Mr. Bush have more to do with rewarding wealthy friends than jump-starting the economy. Had Congress granted his every wish, including the vague ones he announced in Houston, the overall economy would barely have noticed. 
 Take Mr. Bush's obsessive call for a cut in the tax on capital gains, the profit from selling stocks, bonds and other investments. The evidence is overwhelming that such a cut would have a trivial impact on economic growth. Indeed, based on estimates by the President's own chief economic adviser, Michael Boskin, the cut would boost the economy by -- at most -- a measly 0.2 percent. Yet, disgracefully, it remains the centerpiece of the Mr. Bush's domestic agenda.
The thread that runs through the President's tax cuts is reward for the wealthy. How else can he explain his plan to cut the capital gains tax on past investments? That would produce windfall profits for asset holders, but do nothing to spur investment. Similar proposals to bail out real estate investors would do nothing to redirect investment toward new plant and equipment, the engine of growth.
Even where Mr. Bush was on to something potentially useful -- for example, lowering taxes on retirement accounts to spur saving -- he backed gimmicks that would needlessly line the pockets of high-income families and send the Federal deficit rocketing upward. On net, this tax cut would hurt the economy.
Some supply-side zealots believe tax cuts make an economic program. But the U.S. tried such nostrums in the 1980's, only to find they led to a consumption binge and billowing deficits.
Tax changes can be effective, but in ways Mr. Bush has never dared to propose. What about scrapping the personal and corporate income tax codes, which often discourage savings and investment, in favor of a consumption tax that would encourage them? Such a tax should be structured to protect low-income families.
That would be worth fighting for: pro-growth and fair. Another way to attack economic malaise is to borrow planks from Bill Clinton's platform. The key to growth is putting skilled workers together with state-of-the-art equipment. That would require targeted tax incentives. But it would also require expensive public investments in schools and infrastructure paid for by broad-based taxes.
Judging from this week's convention oratory, Republicans wouldn't go near such a sensible program because to them all taxes seem evil no matter what their purpose.
Mr. Clinton makes impossible claims for his economic program and ducks its costs. But his proposals at least add up to a program. The President's do not, and that's not Congress's fault.

Bush's Big Bash

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
Woody Allen and Fergie, the Duchess of York, were lucky. The stories of their messy family lives reached Houston too late for God's angry Republicans who had loosed their terrible swift swords upon foes of Bushness and Quaylitude.
Has there ever been such a joyful public bashing of the irrelevant by adults presumed capable of running a large, heavily armed institution? The bashers will doubtless reply, "Where were you when the Democrat Party was dishing it out in New York?" 
 To which I can only point out that biology is kind. As it prepares the aged to accept death, so it enables us all to forget with life-restoring swiftness life's most blatant idiocies, our own as well as politicians'. Within a week or two all memory of Houston's squalid summonses to fear and hate will vanish too from memory.
Meantime, however, let us recall those, not so lucky as Woody and Fergie, whom this Convention so loved to hate. They included Hillary Clinton, Bart Simpson, Murphy Brown, homosexuals and liberals en masse, the entire Congress, nonJudeo-Christians and the media, but especially the media elite.
Buses also had a bad week. Buses had made the mistake of serving as vehicles of transport for agents of the Democrat Party. One wanted to sympathize with buses. After all, they are poor people's last hope for getting out of town without committing car theft. Yet they had let themselves be used by the Democrat Party.
The buses were dupes of Democrat-ism, just as clearly as addlepated, pinko, ultra-left-liberal fellow travelers in the old days had been dupes of Communism. Victory in the war against Clintonhood and Goredom will not be won by softness on dupes.
At the Convention's end we had been offered so much to fear and hate that buses seemed the easy place to start the job. People of squeamish personality find it easier to kick a bus in its tires than to put the boot into Mrs. Clinton.
And what was a man to do about the terrible Democrat-Congress situation that had caused all the unemployment, bankruptcies, poverty, savings and loan rip-offs and homelessness, not to mention leaving 35 million people without health insurance plus creating unwed mothers and too much sex in movies and television, despite the heroic ingenuity with which Mr. Bush had fought these catastrophes?
I can tell you what one red-blooded American lad wanted to do: He wanted to go right to Washington and mug a Congressman. He might have done so too, but he realized it was not what a true Judeo-Christian would do. So he said, "All right, I'll do the civilized thing and vote against Congressman Frank Wolf."
"But the Convention doesn't want you to do that," I cautioned. "The Convention is down on Democrat Congressmen, and Wolf is not a Democrat Congressman. He is a Republic Congressman."
It was that kind of week. All that hate building up inside a viewer, and no way to let it out. The Convention seemed to be suffering the same difficulty on its side of the TV tube. You could sense its pain in the occasional dig at Mario Cuomo.
For years the Republics had been preparing to run against Cuomo, had drawn up all those plans, gathered all that data, were just rearing for a crack at Mario. And he had spoiled it all, undone all that preparation, had deprived them of the opportunity to point with horror at squalid Times Square, had Cuomo, the rat!
Things and people that escaped Houston unbashed provide brooding material for heavy thinkers. Most notable of course was Communism. Now flourishing in China with Mr. Bush's indulgent acquiescence, Communism became a non-ism. Chelsea Clinton, daughter of Hillary, escaped unbashed, as did Willie Horton, rap music and bloody violence in TV and movies.
Why Republicans recoil from sex-as-entertainment but are unruffled by entertainment bloodshed is not logically explicable. Mr. Bush, of course, is pals not only with the gun lobby but also with Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose mass cop-killings as "The Terminator" made him a star, but the sense that shows about violence are manly while shows dealing with sex are dirty is anchored deep in the national psyche.
The Woody and Fergie stories are sex stories, but pure soap-opera stuff. It would have been interesting to hear Dan Quayle bash the soaps. Too bad the news arrived too late.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Honeywell Patent Suit Is Settled

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Honeywell Inc. announced yesterday that it had settled with seven camera makers it had accused of infringing its patented technology for autofocus lenses, and would be paid more than $124 million.
 The agreements were negotiated separately with Canon Inc., the Eastman Kodak Company, Konica, the Kyocera Corporation, Matsushita, Nikon and Premier, Honeywell said. 
Investors reacted positively to the news. On a day when broad market averages tumbled, Honeywell's stock price rose by $1.375, to $64.50 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Doing the Accounting
 Christopher J. Steffen, an executive vice president and chief financial officer at the Minneapolis-based company, said Honeywell reported $13.9 million in gross proceeds from the settlement in the second quarter. The remainder will be reported in the current quarter, he said.
 Royalties for camera sales by these companies will continue through March 28, 1995, Honeywell said, when its applicable autofocus patents expire.
 The settlements yesterday follow a $127.5 million payment made in March by the Minolta Camera Company.
 
Verdict in New Jersey
 Minolta made the payment after a Federal jury in New Jersey found in February that Minolta had willfully infringed two patents for the autofocus technology, and awarded Honeywell $96.35 million.
 The money awarded by the trial jury applied only to damages until the trial. It did not reflect compensation for sales outside the United States, interest or other matters that were included in the final settlement.
 Following the Minolta award, Honeywell filed suits to force the largely Japanese camera industry to pay royalties for the autofocus technology, now an integral part of the modern camera.
 Last spring, Honeywell said it would seek patent-infringement settlements from as many as 15 companies.
 
Where Will They Spend It?
 Analysts said Honeywell might use the proceeds from the settlements to continue a five-year, $600 million stock repurchase program announced late last year, or to make an acquisition in one of the company's three key businesses: space and aviation, industrial controls, and home and building controls.
 But the awards do little to alter the company's longer-term prospects, the analysts said.
 "After they have gotten all the cash from these suits, the issue going forward is what does their book of business look like," said Elliott Rogers, a vice president at Cowan & Company in New York.
 "I think Honeywell's growth will be restrained by a slowdown in the aerospace business, which had been one of their key driving forces, as well as sluggish economic growth worldwide, which is dampening demand for their products."

HEADLINE: Drop in Dollar Chokes Off Rally in Bonds

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices sank yesterday as the dollar fell to a record low against the German mark.
 The dollar's decline quashed a rally the bond market had been staging in response to President Bush's speech to the Republican convention on Thursday. 
In the speech, Mr. Bush pledged tax cuts but also said they would be linked to restrained Government spending. The market had been fearful that Mr. Bush would make proposals that would have the effect of increasing the Federal budget deficit. Higher deficits force the Government to issue more debt securities, depressing the prices of existing bonds.
 But yesterday's early rally faltered as bond traders focused on the action in the currency markets, where the dollar's decline defied efforts by central banks to push it higher.
 
Keeping the Dollar Down
 The dollar has fallen recently largely over concern about the direction of the American economy and the higher interest rates available on investments in other countries. Higher rates abroad draw money away from investments denominated in dollars, including Treasury bonds.
 The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond fell 13/32 , or $4.06 for $1,000 in face amount, tumbling from gains of more than $5 in morning trading. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, ended at 7.35 percent, up from 7.32 percent late Thursday.
 In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term maturities had gains of as much as 3/8 point, intermediate maturities gained up to 17/32 and long-term issues rose 7/16 , the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
 The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
 The Lehman Brothers Treasury bond index, which measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.99, to 1,271.90.
 Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 3.13 percent as the discount rate fell a basis point, to 3.07 percent. Yields on six-month bills held at 3.26 percent as their discount stayed at 3.17 percent. Yields on the one-year bills sold at auction Thursday rose to 3.44 percent as the discount gained 4 basis points, to 3.32 percent.
 A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.
 The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, fell to 3 1/8 percent, from 3 1/4 percent late Thursday.
 The Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds was unavailable.

HEADLINE: Fed Division On Rate Cut

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 21

 BODY:
Most Federal Reserve System leaders favored cutting interest rates when they met June 30 and July 1 if new signs of economic weakness appeared, minutes of the session released today show.
 The minutes showed that the panel was divided on the interest rate cut, which occurred July 2. The cut occurred after the Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment rate bounded to 7.8 percent in June from 7.5 percent in May as the number of nonfarm jobs fell by 63,000. 
The Fed pushed the discount rate to 3 percent from 3 1/2 percent on loans that it makes to banks, and pressured the Federal funds rate on loans between banks to a target of 3 1/4 percent from 3 3/4 on July 2.
 The Federal Open Market Committee, which heavily influences the Federal funds rate, was split on whether interest rates should be cut in a 10-to-2 vote during the June 30-July 1 meeting.
 Voting against a rate cut were John P. LaWare, governor of the Federal Reserve Board, and Thomas Melzer, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.

HEADLINE: Economic Fears Cut 50.79 From Dow

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

 BODY:
Stock prices plunged yesterday as a falling dollar and worries that an economic recovery would be stifled by higher interest rates set off a wave of computer-driven sell programs.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.79 points, or 1.5 percent, to 3,254.10, its lowest close in four months. 
Today was a simple case of the dollar killing the bond market, and the stock market following," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer at John Hancock Mutual Funds in Boston. "I think it's a temporary downturn, but there was no stopping it."
 The Dow jumped sharply in the opening minutes of trading, fed by a positive response to President Bush's promise to cut both taxes and spending if he is re-elected in November. But prices were drifting downward just before noon, when traders noticed that efforts by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to prop up the dollar had failed.
 As the dollar sank to its lowest level ever against the German mark, bond traders saw hopes for lower interest rates extinguished, and once they began to sell, stocks began a nose dive of their own.
 
Intervention Failed
 "When news came along that central bank intervention was less than successful," said Philip H. Smyth of Birinyi Associates, "the selling began."
 The largest of seven computerized sell programs tracked yesterday by Mr. Smyth began at 11:45 and lasted about 25 minutes, forcing the Dow down 30 points. It involved about 400 of the 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's index, he said, as well as 100 smaller stocks in the Nasdaq composite index.
 For the day, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 3.41, to 414.85, while the Nasdaq composite index lost 4.16, to 563.70. Gaining stocks, at 667, were smothered by 1,040 losing ones.
 Trading was active, with 204.8 million shares changing hands, up from the 183.4 million on Thursday.
 Other analysts said the selling was compounded by the expiration of stock and index options, which usually encourage program trading in one direction or the other, making the market more vulnerable to wild price swings.
 "Expirations accounted for some of the action," said Gene J. Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal & Company. "There's been a lot of bearishness. At this point, the market is very close to becoming oversold."
 
Bounce Expected Next Week
 Mr. Seagle said he expected a bounce in the market next week, especially ifpolls over the weekend indicated a surge of support for President Bush following the Republican convention.
 "There's been a lot of uncertainty about the election, and a lot of worry about Bush," Mr. Seagle said. "I think we're starting to see a turn in that."
 He also noted that the Dow had come close to 3,250, seen by technical analysts as an important support level. If selling continues, he warned, the Dow could fall much further.
 Mr. Freedman expressed optimism that the market would rebound soon, particularly if the economy continued to move toward recovery.
 "The market is still jittery about the dollar," he said. "But the alternatives to stocks and bonds still aren't there. Maybe the summer rally is over, but there is room to move upward."
 Yesterday's most active stock was USX Marathon, which fell 1/8, to 18 5/8, over concern that the company's board would soon cut its dividend.
 B. F. Goodrich fell 3 1/8, to 40 1/2, after analysts sharply cut their earnings estimates for the chemical concern for two years. Reynolds Metals dropped 3 3/8, to 50, and Alcoa fell 3 1/8, to 64 3/4.
 Among smaller stocks, the Russell index of 2,000 stocks dropped 0.94 point, to 190.01, and the American Stock Exchange index fell 1.56, to 384.31
 Biogen Inc. fell 2 1/8, to 25 3/8, while Gensia Pharmaceuticals fell 2 3/8, to 36 3/8.

 BODY:
THE CHANGING ATMOSPHERE: A Global Challenge, by John Firor. (Yale University, $8.) This book on the environment is strong medicine -- "about as agreeable as a dose of ipecac," our reviewer, Malcolm W. Browne, said in 1990. The author points out that we must be ready either to change our habits or invent substitutes for all that is being destroyed. "Mr. Firor's book is persuasive because it is based more on evenhanded analysis than on advocacy," Mr. Browne noted.
THE ADAPTABLE MAN, by Janet Frame. (Braziller, $9.95.) In this novel, first published 27 years ago, the New Zealand author Janet Frame explores the ways human beings have tried to adapt to the 20th century. One of her characters, Alwyn Maude, has committed an act that seems horrifyingly but quintessentially modern: a senseless murder. In 1965 our reviewer, Wilfrid Sheed, called the book "an original novel, comic, intense, stylish, from one of the most interesting writers around." Braziller is also reissuing DAUGHTER BUFFALO ($8.95), the author's only novel set in New York City and one whose characters, not coincidentally, are all in love with death. "She makes morbidity a spectacle, a brilliant, mutilating feast," Josephine Hendin said here in 1972. 
 WHY GORBACHEV HAPPENED, by Robert G. Kaiser. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14.) The author, who has updated his book with a new introduction, shows how Mikhail Gorbachev succeeded in freeing his country from its Stalinist legacy but was unable to remain its leader. Mr. Gorbachev's political policies ironically strengthened his enemies, while his economic reforms failed to push far enough. Last year our reviewer, Marshall I. Goldman, described this book as an "excellent chronicle. . . . It is hard to find a contemporary drama that is more absorbing." For the former Soviet leader's own perspective, there is THE AUGUST COUP: The Truth and the Lessons (Harper Perennial, $10). Although our reviewer, Philip Taubman, found this memoir a bit wooden and self-serving, "it is hard to begrudge Mr. Gorbachev the chance to see himself as he once was," he said last year. Raisa Gorbachev gets her say in I HOPE, reminiscences and reflections translated by David Floyd (Harper Perennial, $10). Here the former Soviet First Lady proves herself "a woman of considerable intelligence," Jane Taubman said in The Book Review in 1991. "She was more than a bit player in bringing about the reforms that forever changed the course of Russian history."
TRAFFIC AND LAUGHTER, by Ted Mooney. (Vintage Contemporaries, $12.) In this surreal novel, which begins in a slightly skewed contemporary Los Angeles, a female disk jockey and a South African actress become pawns -- along with the atomic bomb -- in an eccentric extortion plot to procure world peace. "This is new-wave literary joke making at its best -- and its most serious," our reviewer, Douglas Glover, said in 1990.
WOODY ALLEN: A Biography, by Eric Lax. (Vintage, $13.) Mr. Lax had full access -- or as full as anyone gets -- to Woody Allen, a film maker whose success with women appears oddly parallel to Cyrano de Bergerac's and who can make New York seem like a place worth escaping to instead of from. "What [Mr. Lax] gives us is Woody Allen as a personality whom we both like and dislike," Molly Haskell said here last year. "The moody maestro wouldn't want it any other way."
AFTER SHOCKS/NEAR ESCAPES, by Stephen Dobyns. (Penguin, $10.) Lucy Recabarren has seen her world literally come apart. A survivor of the enormous earthquake that rocked Chile in 1960, she looks back on its physical losses and emotional repercussions. Last year our reviewer, Ron Loewinsohn, found this novel "intelligently conceived and competently executed."
SIGNS OF THE TIMES: Deconstruction and the Fall of Paul de Man, by David Lehman. (Poseidon, $13.) Deconstruction, the literary theory that held that all meaning in language is essentially relative, shifting and undefinable, was ultimately undermined by the discovery of some very clear meanings in the writings of one of its proponents. In 1987, Paul de Man, a native of Belgium, a Yale professor and a leading deconstructionist who had died four years before, was exposed as the author of a large number of pro-Nazi articles in his youth. This book is a "valuably detailed if sometimes highly polemical account of the ensuing crisis," Malcolm Bradbury said in The Book Review last year.
BEYOND DESERVING, by Sandra Scofield. (Plume, $10.) Winner of an American Book Award, this novel is populated by characters who might have come out of a self-help book like "Smart Women, Foolish Choices." But the women of the Fisher clan, a southern Oregon family, actually prefer their men a little rough around the edges. " 'Beyond Deserving' pleasingly satirizes aspects of our therapeutic society," our reviewer, Rand Richards Cooper, said last year, calling this an "intelligent and observant novel."
THE LAST DETECTIVE, by Peter Lovesey. (Bantam, $4.99.) Mr. Lovesey, who traditionally mines the past for his mysteries, has made this one strictly contemporary, except, perhaps, for the rather Luddite inclinations of his English hero, Detective Superintendent Peter Diamond, who competes against modern forensic technology to find the murderer of a former soap-opera star. Last year our reviewer, Josh Rubins, admired this "bravura performance from a veteran showman."

RUSSIA TRANSFORMED: BREAKTHROUGH TO HOPE
Moscow, August 1991.
By James H. Billington.
202 pp. New York:
The Free Press. $19.95. 
 JAMES H. BILLINGTON, the Librarian of Congress, has spent his life studying, writing and teaching Russian history. In August 1991 he found himself in Moscow on routine library business. He had no way of knowing, of course, that midway through his two-week trip he would become a witness to a major turning point in Russian history -- the ineffectual effort by Communist Party, military and K.G.B. hard-liners to reverse the unmistakable trend toward the breakup of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the Communist Party. The failed coup only accelerated those tendencies.
It was a remarkable time indeed for those in Moscow for the few days in August. Every writer dreams of what it would be like to be present at such a moment. This is particularly true of historians, whose professional careers are spent vicariously reading about the exploits of others. And Mr. Billington is very sympathetic when he says, "It was exhilarating for me, as a historian who had studied Russia for nearly half a century, to be present for events that I knew from the beginning would be historic." He notes that another American, the journalist and political activist John Reed, happened to be in Petrograd when the Bolsheviks carried out their successful takeover in 1917. But Mr. Billington acknowledges that unlike Reed, he did not get very close to any of the major players and took no photos and only a few notes. "Russia Transformed: Breakthrough to Hope," then, is not really a chronicle of the coup, although in its brevity it provides a useful review of the high points. Instead, Mr. Billington's book adds something of a different dimension to supplement the journalistic accounts on this anniversary.
The putsch, as Russians call it, was over quickly. It was announced with forboding on Moscow television in the early hours before people went to work on Monday, Aug. 19, and within 72 hours a shaky Mikhail S. Gorbachev was free from Crimean house arrest and back in Moscow. Unlike the Bolsheviks in 1917, who had no qualms about seizing power brutally, chasing Aleksandr Kerensky into exile and murdering the Czar and his family, the coup leaders had no stomach for violence. As a result, they allowed Boris N. Yeltsin, then the most popular politician in Moscow, to stand them down at his "White House," the headquarters of the Russian Government, which became the rallying point for democrats and all others who wanted to see an end to the old system.
For those who came together around Mr. Yeltsin, the triumph was unexpected, and therefore all the more spectacular. They, and most of Moscow, had assumed on Aug. 19 that the combined powers of the party, the army and the K.G.B. would insure a successful coup and an end to Mr. Gorbachev's experiments in political freedom and economic change, which were generally popular even if Mr. Gorbachev was not. Thus the victory over the coup was regarded by most Russians as a chudo, or miracle, and it took on almost a spiritual dimension, which Mr. Billington, an expert on Russian cultural history, documents very perceptively.
"When free television returned after 48 hours of junta control, the resistance was instantly mythologized in a series of beautiful documentaries that portrayed the struggle in the manner of the ancient chronicles -- the original, Christian literature of Russia -- as a pure struggle between good and evil, light and darkness," he writes. "Moscow was again belokamenny, the 'white-stoned' city of legend."
The trouble was, of course, that Mr. Gorbachev was no Ivan the Terrible or Peter the Great, at a time when the country was desperate for leadership. Mr. Gorbachev's popularity was low before the coup because of the perception that he was a bit of a windbag, with lots of talk and little action. Just as the leaders of the putsch were indecisive, Mr. Gorbachev in victory was equally Hamletlike. He first tried to preserve the Communist Party but then presided over its dissolution.
And after trying to keep the union together with halfhearted diplomatic efforts, he finally resigned as president on Dec. 25, 1991, acknowledging that the Soviet Union had collapsed, with each of the 15 former component republics claiming its own independence and national sovereignty. In turn, Mr. Yeltsin, who in August had been Mr. Gorbachev's savior, now rose to power as the head of the largest state. But from the heights of popularity, Mr. Yeltsin found himself within a year also being mocked for his failure to bring about a dramatic improvement in the Russian people's way of life.
Mr. Billington remains guardedly optimistic. He notes at the end that a year after the coup, in the summer of 1992, "cynicism was great, corruption was increasing, political conflict was in the open; and there was some nostalgia for the relative order and predictability of the Communist era. The near-term prognosis seemed ominous." Yet, he concludes, the Russians had survived their first winter without either internal social upheaval or outright conflict: "Russia's horizons seemed somehow to be widening even as its borders contracted. Russians had been released in August from the fear of power to discover the power of hope."

 BODY:
IN THE COLONNADE outside the Oval Office, Barbara Walters tests the white wrought-iron bench where she will sit to question the President of the United States.
The bench is not the most comfortable place to sit. But the Rose Garden is bathed in sunshine this summer morning, and Dorrance Smith, the assistant to the President for media affairs, thinks the interview will look sensational against that backdrop. 
 Walters sits with a stack of index cards in her lap, each card containing a question she intends to ask. She has already done the research -- most of it herself -- prepared the questions, supervised the publicity and approved the wardrobe, makeup and hair.
Softly la-ti-dah-ing an unidentifiable tune, Walters looks at herself on camera, analyzing the angles, the lighting and the sounds the rustling wind makes in her microphone. As always, she sits camera right, exposing her left side. ("After all this time," she says, "I know that's my better side.")
It is a Monday morning, five days from the broadcast of her ABC news-magazine program, "20/20." The breezy colonnade is the site of the latest episode in the remarkably enduring television institution known as the Barbara Walters Interview.
If anything, the institution has only grown in importance in recent years, fed by ever intensifying competition from other network news magazines and syndicated talk shows. The range of what people are willing to say on television has changed. Walters, who has always sought to establish a personal intimacy with her interview subjects, has unquestionably been the chief agent of the change that has brought to prominence other probers of the personal, from Phil Donahue to Oprah Winfrey.
Though some critics continue to find her unforgivably irritating, and have never stopped complaining that her questions are too soft, her approach too chummy, the 60-year-old Walters has survived an unmatched run of 30 years as the most recognizable woman in network news. Despite the competition and the critics, she remains the interviewer of record for American television.
In the past year, Walters has had one of her strongest runs of big interviews. She has landed exclusive sessions with the former hostage Terry Waite; with the tennis star Arthur Ashe immediately after his revelation that he has AIDS; with the so-called suicide doctor Jack Kevorkian. At a time when politics has become primary programming on television, she has talked with Boris Yeltsin, and with Ross Perot twice -- as he was dipping a toe in and then withdrawing abruptly from the Presidential race.
The White House, extremely careful about its media opportunities, chose Walters as the vehicle for the President's first prime-time interview during the campaign. Smith, who knows television -- and Walters -- well from his days at ABC News, where he was executive producer of "Nightline," says: "We picked Barbara because she's a fair interview. She knows what a prime-time interview is." As Smith hovers, Walters discreetly turns over her stack of index cards -- just in case he might try to take a peek.
The interview with the President and Mrs. Bush is cordial, but not overly chummy. Walters presses the President on his record, and the dissatisfaction of the voters. When she mentions the stories of Perot's "investigating" Bush's sons, the President bristles visibly and answers angrily. His reaction will receive national coverage. That will help spark intensified verbal attacks from both campaigns that wind up diminishing Perot's standing in the opinion polls -- and, apparently, his stomach for major-league politics.
Afterwards, Walters declares herself pleased with the interview. To mark the occasion, the ABC crew assembles to pose with the Bushes for a photograph on the Rose Garden steps. Before leaving, Walters asks the President to autograph one of her index cards.
IN EVERY INTERVIEW, Barbara Walters sits forward in her chair, holding a stack of index cards in her lap, glancing at them quickly, unobtrusively. The rest of the time she leans toward her subject, her eyes boring in, almost squinting with intensity. But her facial expression is benign, her body language unthreatening. The unspoken message behind her gaze is: "I understand; I care; I'm here for you."
Even when her questions seem bland or unchallenging -- her critics would call them cloying -- the people she interviews often feel as though she hasgot way below skin level. Anthony Hopkins, who appeared on her pre-Oscar celebrity interview special in March, found the effect unnerving at first. "The interview was terribly intimate," he said.
Intimacy is expressly what Walters is going for. She gets to people on camera with that look and some deceptively simple questions. "What was the best time for you? The worst time?"
Walters's questions make some people cringe. Part of this has to do with who she is: the journalist as celebrity; the interviewer who rode a speedboat with Don Johnson, who mamboed with Patrick Swayze, the woman who urged Jimmy Carter to "be good to us" and to "be wise with us."
Still, even her most adamant critics would find it hard to dispute her success. Inside an ABC news division top-heavy with stars -- Peter Jennings, Ted Koppel, Diane Sawyer -- Walters is the highest-paid, making an estimated $3 million to $4 million a year in salary. In truth, she is doing even better than that, after recently selling off to ABC the rights to her library of celebrity specials.
ABC is not complaining about a dime. With both "20/20" and the celebrity specials significant moneymakers for the network, Walters probably generates more profits than any other broadcast journalist. And yet, rather stunningly, ABC News almost let its chief rainmaker slip out the door last year. Walters was seriously wooed by CBS. The deal, as Walters describes it, involved "much more money," her own prime-time magazine program, the best producers and correspondents CBS had and a guaranteed time slot: 10 P.M. Monday, after CBS's powerhouse comedies. (The time period was given to "Northern Exposure," which this year became the biggest dramatic hit on television.)
Unaccountably, ABC had simply allowed its exclusive renegotiation period with Walters to lapse.
For Walters, always intensely conscious of her professional standing, an indication that she may not have been an urgent priority for her bosses is not easily shrugged off. "My problems weren't money but sometimes feeling less than part of the team," she says. "I felt I was being neglected in news. I was bringing in all this money, and I was sort of taken for granted."
The CBS deal would have had a downside, however. It would have meant jumping networks for the second time in her career, something that would have guaranteed the kind of relentless scrutiny that accompanied her move to ABC from NBC in 1976. Then, her precedent-setting, $1-million-a-year salary -- to be both anchor of ABC's evening news and do her own specials -- left her open to a fusillade of slams as the symbol of television news selling out to entertainment values.
At the outset, the move to ABC turned into the biggest fiasco of Walters's career. Her teaming with the incumbent anchor, Harry Reasoner, descended quickly into overt hostility. Eventually, the new ABC News president, Roone Arledge, installed a new anchor threesome, reassigning Walters to do special interviews. That project wound up producing Walters's own version of shuttle diplomacy in the late 1970's with her interviews of Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat. Despite those successes, Walters says, "I'm still kind of shell-shocked from 15 years ago."
Late last year, she finally signed on for five more years at ABC, partly out of loyalty to Arledge, mostly because she decided the CBS offer, great as it was, wasn't worth the changes it would mean in her life. "If I had been thinking only of money," Walters says, "I would do a syndicated talk show, because I'm one of the few who could cross over into that. And then I would make $75 million a year. I would make Oprah money."
ON ANOTHER MONDAY MORNING this year, Barbara Walters is getting set up for Desiree Washington, the young woman whom the heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson had been convicted of raping. Representative of the latest source of ratings-generating interviews -- the unexpected headline-maker -- Washington has chosen Walters and "20/20" as the one forum in which to tell her side of the story.
In the days since hearing she had landed Washington for this exclusive interview, Walters worried that the young woman might get cold feet -- or else, and worse, might agree to do an interview with another prominent television questioner first.
"For all I know," Walters fretted the night before the interview, "she could be sitting down with Ed Bradley right now." Bradley, the "60 Minutes" correspondent, had scored one of the bigger coups in the can-you-top-this sweepstakes among the network news-magazine programs: he had landed the first television interview with Anita Hill.
That had been preceded by another interview Walters had missed, with Patricia Bowman, the woman who accused William Kennedy Smith of rape. Diane Sawyer, of the other ABC news magazine, "Prime Time Live," got that one.
"I had gone after Anita Hill and so had Diane and everybody else," Walters says. "I didn't eat my heart out. I knew that Ed Bradley could offer things I could not offer. And Diane had also been turned down."
It would be difficult, of course, to find an interview scorecard that compares with that of Barbara Walters. The list of one-on-one interviews she has conducted reads like the index of a late 20th-century history book: Eisenhower, Nixon, Johnson, Begin, Sadat, Carter, Castro, the Shah, Reagan, Qaddafi, Arafat, Thatcher, Bush, Yeltsin. It would be far easier to list the important world leaders of the past 30 years whom Walters hasn't talked to: among them Gorbachev, Mandela, Ho Chi Minh, Mao.
But as news programs have spread all over network television, the chase for the big interview has clearly become frenzied -- even for the leader of the pack. "One of the things now in television that makes it not as much fun is the enormous competition," Walters says, "and the attitude out there that if you don't get it, somehow you've failed. And the biggest competition that we have is from 'Prime Time,' which is almost the identical program to ours. Diane is my colleague and we like each other very much. But we are probably more competitive than anybody. Diane and I have a kind of feeling that if we don't get the interview, we want the other one to get it, rather than '60 Minutes.' But having said that, I mean, when Diane got the interview with Patricia Bowman, it was as if I'd failed."
So the Desiree Washington interview, though newsworthy on its own, is also clearly a counterpunch. As Walters candidly admits, "I do feel a little grateful she's doing the interview with me."
Going into the interview, Walters expects to feel empathy for Washington, but says that has nothing to do with gratitude. It is simply what almost always happens when she immerses herself through her research in all the intimate details of a person's life. "You really feel you know the person," Walters says of the process.
In Washington's case, Walters says she expects to feel even more. "This girl is barely 18," Walters says, "and I do feel maternal toward her. I can think of my own daughter, who could easily be in this position." Walters's daughter, Jacqueline, now 24, is a frequent reference point in her mother's conversation.
More than anything else, what distinguishes a Barbara Walters interview, whether from her traditional genres -- leaders of the world stage and the Hollywood screen -- or the new category of news makers with a story to tell, is that effort to get at the essence of who a person is, more than simply what he or she may think or have to say.
As one of her regular "20/ 20" producers, Ene Riisna, puts it, "She makes an interview like a play; she always goes for the emotional revelation."
When Washington arrives at the Pierre Hotel suite ABC has set up for the interview, it is instantly obvious that she is even more skittish than Walters anticipated. She has come alone; no lawyers, no parents. As she sits for a microphone test, surrounded by technicians and production assistants, the slightly built, softly pretty young woman looks like a fawn in the middle of a crowded interstate.
Walters immediately senses the danger. She compliments Washington on her clothes, tells her how glamorous she's going to look on camera. But Washington is agitated, and continually pages through a notebook where she has written down what she wants to say.
Nothing could be worse, as far as Walters is concerned. A nervous interview that sounds rehearsed is a disaster. She tells Washington to put away the notes. "Don't worry," Walters says, "I'll help you."
Still, as the crew is set to begin, Washington looks one breath from panic. "Can we practice first?" she asks Walters. It is a suggestion Walters resists, because preinterviewing leads to stilted answers. Walters continues to stroke and soothe Washington verbally, saying, "You've already gone through the most important test of your life, so what does this matter?"
A few seconds later, the cameras roll and the formal interview begins, almost without Desiree Washington realizing it. And it flows; it has the rhythms Walters seeks. As the interview ends, Washington and Walters stand to remove their microphones. Washington looks totally drained. Walters, as if in slow motion, reaches out her arms, puts them around the young woman's shoulders and gives her a hug.
BARBARA WALTERS'S apartment occupies a full floor on Fifth Avenue overlooking the park. It is densely decorated with art and furniture. "I moved here when I got married," Walters says, referring to her third marriage, to the television executive Merv Adelson, whom she is divorcing. "My husband wanted a larger apartment. So he's gone, but the apartment stayed."
Much of the crew who worked on the Desiree Washington interview that morning has assembled in the main working room of the apartment, the library. The entire room is blood-red: walls, bookshelves, floor-to-ceiling cabinet doors. In the middle of the room are two enormous exercise machines, a Stair Master and a treadmill. A giant stuffed tiger sits across the bars of the treadmill, looking like a permanent occupant.
Walters, in slacks and a comfortable-looking purple sweater, is conducting the "paper edit" on the transcript of the Washington interview, the first step before the actual video is edited. (Typically, an hourlong interview will end up as about 22 minutes on the air.) Martin Clancy, the producer, sits next to Walters on a couch. Spread around on the floor are the assistant producers and researchers. The room is a din of conflicting voices. Walters's elderly poodle enters periodically and yaps. The two live-in employees who have been with her for years wander through, bringing cookies and tea, answering phones.
As she works, Walters watches the big-screen television across the room, waiting for a "20/20" promo. "In the past couple of years, the promos have all gone to 'Prime Time,' " Walters says matter-of-factly. "The feeling was they were in chaos."
For the Washington interview, however, Walters wants a big promotional push. At the commercial break, she turns up the sound to hear the promo. Everybody in the room hates it. The consensus is that the promo fails to communicate the obvious strengths of the interview.
Walters picks up the phone and calls the executive producer of "20/20," Victor Neufeld. " 'Prime Time' 's promo tonight was wonderful," she says. "No one is going to watch us."
She then volunteers to work on a new promo in the morning. Watching her in action, Clancy shakes his head and laughs. "The energy level is simply amazing," he says.
After the editing session ends, Walters conducts a brief tour of some of her favorite mementos -- two hallway walls covered with drawings and photographs.
"This is my radical wall," she says proudly, pointing to rows of photos of Castro, Sadat, Begin, Qaddafi, Arafat. She points to the inscription from Arafat, "Revolution until victory," and Castro: "As a remembrance of the most difficult interview that I have had in all the days of my life."
In another section, she points to a group shot. "This is the first group that went to China with Nixon." Walters scans the notable faces in the crowd. "There's Nixon. There's Ron Ziegler. Here I am, pushy cookie." She is up close to Nixon in the middle. "And way over here," she says, tracing her finger to the opposite side of the crowd shot, "that's Diane. She was an assistant press secretary. There were only two women on the trip who were reporters, Helen Thomas and me."
THE SUNSHINE IS garishly bright outside a secluded bungalow deep within the verdant grounds of the Beverly Hills Hotel. Inside, Barbara Walters sits thumbing through her index cards, getting ready for Tom Cruise. "I've restructured the Scientology questions," she says.
Walters has been debating about how much to make of Cruise's membership in the much-debunked Church of Scientology. "I know I've got to ask him about it. But I also know this show will be on Academy Award night and that the audience will find Scientology rather boring."
For Walters this is not going to be a tough call, though she realizes it opens her to more criticism about preferring soft personal information to harder news. Walters's top priority is what prime-time television viewers -- not other news reporters -- want to hear. "A long time ago I decided I couldn't do interviews to please the editors of The New York Times," she says.
In place of debating the merits of Scientology, Walters will emphasize Cruise's childhood. "I have a lot about his father abandoning the family." She pauses and says, sotto voce, "I like difficult childhoods."
All around her there is activity again among the troupe that constitutes the specials unit: Bill Geddie, the executive producer; his production team; Walters's friend Sally Safir, who doubles as fashion consultant; Walters's personal assistants, Monica Caulfield and Moira McCann. Walters's hair stylist, Bryant Renfroe, is spraying and arranging her bangs; her makeup artist, Sajata, who goes by one name only, is dabbing her gently.
After what Geddie calls a long pursuit, Tom Cruise has consented to sit for the interview many Hollywood stars now consider a defining moment in their careers. "It is definitely the American interview you do when you have made it in the movies," Anthony Hopkins says.
Pat Kingsley, Cruise's powerhouse publicity woman, who has delivered about a dozen stars to Walters's side, says: "It's Barbara Walters. This is a woman who has interviewed heads of state, presidents and kings. She's the only one who does that. It's major league."
Beyond that, Walters has maintained good relations with the Hollywood crowd by having a reputation for never giving stars a hard time. "I don't want to hurt them and they know that," Walters says. She makes a definite distinction between how she conducts a celebrity interview and how she conducts a news interview. She won't do a movie star on "20/20."
Still, as Kingsley puts it: "It's not a hard-hitting interview. That would be too risky for the stars. But they are not totally softball questions either. She somehow makes people feel comfortable in a rather awkward situation."
For Cruise, Walters stays mostly with the personal side: his childhood, his failed marriage to the actress Mimi Rogers, his current marriage to the actress Nicole Kidman. She does not press him hard about Scientology. She asks him about it. He answers. She moves on.
Cruise relaxes in the interview, even laughs a lot. In the limousine after the interview, Walters is up, thrilled with how the day has gone. "I liked him enormously," she says. "And he was happy. I like that. I don't want them to go away discouraged."
ONE WEEK WHEN Walters was working on both "Nightline" and "20/20," she said, "I have to laugh because I wonder what all the people who hate me are going to watch this week."
Some people truly detest Barbara Walters. They ridicule the distinctions she makes between celebrities and news figures, saying all her interviews are equally gushy. They point to her own rich and famous life style, her association with powerful friends, and contend such access to power can only compromise a journalist.
Critics cite what they view as an unfailing tendency to fawn on those in power, especially those who may have been targets of a hostile press, as she herself has been. A centerpiece of her interview with Vice President Dan Quayle, for example, was a number of questions about how tough the media and the late-night comedians had been on him and the impact of all the pillorying on his family.
One producer who has worked with her frequently says, "She has a lot of people who are afraid of her." This producer claims Walters is a master at manipulating people. "She's a chameleon," the producer says, adding that she isn't as successful in interviews as her supporters believe her to be. "She's good at getting the interview coup. She always goes for the gotcha question, the one that reveals the person. She doesn't follow up."
Even as far back as her days on the "Today" show, according to another producer, Walters was susceptible to the allure of power. "Barbara has a very strong respect for power and position," the producer Stuart Schulberg was quoted as saying in a 1974 Newsweek profile. "She will not ask the ultimate jugular question."
Walters has heard every sort of criticism for years, of course, but she has not changed her style much in response to it. In the first of her Ross Perot interviews this year, Walters risked the wrath of the hard-news crowd by spending half her time with Margot Perot. But Mrs. Perot had never been interviewed on television, and Walters believed that the similarities and differences among the three wives of the potential candidates was a matter of real viewer interest.
CBS president Howard Stringer, who tried to hire her away last year, says it's pointless to compare Walters with someone with a more bellicose style, like Mike Wallace of "60 Minutes." "Barbara is an idiosyncratic interviewer," Stringer says. "That's part of what makes her effective." The chief idiosyncrasy: Walters questions people but doesn't challenge them. She will probe, she will press; she will not prosecute.
Walters herself emphatically repudiates charges that she's too soft, maintaining, "I don't do silly, giddy interviews." She thinks it simply makes sense for her to spend more time finding out whether Mrs. Perot advises her husband and less time pressing Perot on his plan to cut the deficit. "You have to know when the audience's eyes are going to glaze over," she says.
As for the other consistent criticism of her, her willingness to interview a celebrity one day and a head of state the next, she argues that journalists all over television do both sorts of stories. "I did it all the time on the 'Today' show, when you had the news maker at 7:30 and the celebrity at 8:30 and nobody said a thing."
Walters ruefully remembers her first days at ABC, when she was excoriated by some of her television news colleagues for her exhortation to the Carters to be good and wise. "I do think the statute of limitations should have run out on that one by now," Walters says. "If I had it to do over, I probably wouldn't have said it."
Then there was the infamous Katharine Hepburn tree question. The truth about that one, Walters says, is that Hepburn instigated it by describing herself as an old tree. Walters insists she never said, "If you could be any kind of tree, what kind would you be?" With a real edge in her voice, she dismisses the tree episode as apocryphal. "It's Baba Wawa stuff," Walters says, referring to the apparently still-painful memory of the "Saturday Night Live" parody of her performed by Gilda Radner. "Back then everybody was gunning for me.
"They criticized me for everything at the beginning," Walters recalls. "My salary, the way I pronounce my R's. Who is this terrible person on with this serious newsman, Harry Reasoner? I felt very wounded. I had a mother, a father, a retarded sister and a daughter I was supporting. And my career was finished. I was drowning. I was not only drowning, I was reading every day about people who were happy to put my head under the water. I remember thinking, I should really go to a psychiatrist to work this out. And then I thought: What is there to work out? I'm failing. I made a mistake. What's he going to say to me?"
Walters acknowledges that she still feels the sting of negative comments. After the Perot interview, she was "tremendously offended" when a reporter in this newspaper identified her as "celebrity questioner Barbara Walters." But overall, she says, the critics in the news media are kinder now. "They say, 'Gee, you know, she works hard. It's O.K.' "
Walters attributes her lingering sense of insecurity to growing up with the unpredictability of her father's career as a nightclub owner. That had brought her at an early age into the world of show business and introduced her to a lavish life style. ("I joke and say there isn't a penthouse in New York I haven't lived in.") But after her father, overextended, lost his nightclubs, she was forced into a position of having to support her family. That early push to make it on her own has clearly fueled the unstinting, full-speed-ahead drive that has kept her where she is for so long.
Current producers and co-workers have virtually nothing negative to say about her. Many assert that working with Walters was the best professional experience of their careers. Even the producer who came to dislike her intensely, who charges that "the only thing she values is the image of herself on television," admits: "She is not a prima donna. She is the hardest working woman I have ever known. That's how she's gotten where she's gotten."
As for being too cozy with the elite people she interviews, Walters contends that social connections never interfere with her work. When she talks about how she sets up an interview, the story often includes a detail like: "I ran into Martina in Aspen on New Year's Eve." But that meeting resulted in a news-making interview with the tennis star Martina Navratilova that made "20/ 20" the highest-rated program in television that week.
Walters's friends include Beverly Sills, the agent Mort Janklow and the financier Felix Rohatyn. She dates prominent, powerful men. In recent months she has been seeing a lot of Senator John Warner of Virginia, the former husband of Elizabeth Taylor. (Walters had interviewed the Senator and the actress together in 1977 and, in this instance anyway, appears to have violated her own policy of never dating men she has interviewed.)
For all of Walters's financial success, she knows that as long as she remains at a network, she will never make the kind of money available to stars like Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue in syndication. Yet she refuses to look down her nose at her daytime counterparts. From Walters's point of view, what Oprah and Phil do is not all that different from what she does, even if they occasionally have to concoct a program out of thin women who love fat men and mothers who date their daughters' boyfriends.
"I could do that stuff," Walters says. "We in news are so pure. But the audience doesn't care. They think what Oprah does is news. The audience can't tell the difference."
WHEN Barbara Walters has trouble getting someone to discuss a sensitive subject, she often resorts to a question like: "What is the greatest misconception about you?"
And yet, when asked that question herself, she hesitates. First, she says, she's really very funny in person. Finally, she concludes: "I'm really rather shy."
At times her answers are a bit studied, but often they reveal a surprising vulnerability. That comes through most of all when she's talking about her daughter, Jacqueline. Walters doesn't get to see her often. The adopted daughter of Walters and her second husband, the late theatrical producer Lee Guber, Jacqueline now lives in the Pacific Northwest.
When Walters talks of the price she has paid to be where she is, she invariably invokes Jacqueline. In private moments and even in public speeches, she often tells the same story about the time the young Jacqueline said, "Mummy doesn't drive; Mummy doesn't play games; Mummy burns the meat loaf; all Mummy can do is television."
One longtime associate confirms the clear implication of Walters's quote, that it has been very hard at times for Jacqueline to be Barbara Walters's daughter. If Barbara Walters interviewed herself, she would no doubt focus heavily on the price she has paid in her personal life for her success.
Still, she is unabashedly proud at having done so much in television. "There are not too many people who've been working at this as long as I have and at the level I have -- and are still going," she says in a very soft voice.
Colleagues like Victor Neufeld and Ene Riisna frequently use the word "unrelenting" about her. When Walters says, as she often does these days, "I tell myself that I'm at the point in my life and my career where I have to relax a little," it gets a laugh of disbelief from producer Martin Clancy. One former producer says, "Barbara will die with the red light on."
And yet, Walters maintains, she has changed. She points to the interview with Raisa Gorbachev this spring, which had been promised to her, but which went, through some Russian misunderstanding of American television deadlines, to Maria Shriver on NBC. "Five years ago, I would have said, But, my God, she promised me. I'd get on a plane to Moscow and it would have been on the air that night. But now I'm not going to get on a plane to Moscow." Indeed, she says, the real reason she didn't go to CBS was, "I don't want to climb any more mountains."
But what if there were somebody really interesting at the top? What if she could land, say, Saddam Hussein? "I'd go anywhere for Saddam Hussien," she says immediately. Or Castro, again? "I would leave tomorrow to do Fidel Castro." Or, on the day after the Los Angeles riots last spring, Rodney King? "I'd go today."
"I don't want to tell you that if there was a hot news interview, I wouldn't go in a second," Walters explains. "The difference is if I don't get it, I don't sit up at night.
Walters used to say that she had stopped auditioning. But she really hasn't, she admits. "When I'm on 'Nightline,' I'm probably auditioning for ABC News, saying: 'See, I can do this kind of thing too. Just don't think because I do Anthony Hopkins that I can't do the unemployed. Take me seriously.' If I'm auditioning for anything, it's for them to take me seriously."

HEADLINE: House Revolutionary

BYLINE: By Adam Clymer; Adam Clymer is the chief Congressional correspondent of The New York Times.

 BODY:
A ROOM FULL OF THREE DOZEN CLEAN-CUT COLLEGE Juniors who are spending their summer as volunteers at the Republican National Committee might seem like an unlikely place to recruit revolutionaries. Not to Newt Gingrich.
The House Republican whip rushed over to the Capitol Hill Club, a Republican watering hole, one afternoon last month between critical meetings on enterprise zone bills and speeches assailing Democrats. In a 20-minute break from his war on Congress, he told them the welfare state was strangling their dreams. "We will not make it through your lifetime without radical change," he said. "You're either going to force the changes, or your generation is going to suffer a long, steady decline in the quality of life. 
 "I am essentially a revolutionary," he told them. And like any good revolutionary, he identified enemies: bureaucrats who run city governments for their own comfort and not the public's; senior faculty members out of touch with reality, and, above all, the Democrats. Occasionally, he said, virtuous Democrats do come to Congress, but they are quickly told by their leaders: "If you ever want to get on a decent committee, you better learn to sell out." To whom? To the Democrats' basic elements, "a coalition of big-city machines, trial lawyers, union leaders, left-wing activists and political incumbents."
Although Gingrich tends to say so many words so fast that his high voice gets chirpy, like a tape recorder on fast-forward, the volunteers were captivated. They smiled, asked a few respectful questions and applauded as he exhorted them: "Real revolutions are made by the young. They are made by the energetic. They are made by the risk-takers." Then he dashed back to vote against a Democratic bid to kill Vice President Dan Quayle's White House Council on Competitiveness.
Newton Leroy Gingrich, at age 49, is no longer young, but he is an energetic risk-taker. He leads one of the least-noticed but potentially most far-reaching campaigns of this bizarre political year. Gingrich is trying to use voters' anger at government to end 38 years of Democratic control of the House. Outright Republican control would require winning 52 more seats, an awesome electoral swing, but picking up an attainable 30 or so would enable Republicans to dominate the House in alliance with conservative Democrats. The Republicans now hold 166 seats out of 435. Gingrich says the odds are "better than even that we will be above 200 for the first time since 1956. The odds are very, very good."
Gingrich pursues that goal of Republican control in the well of the House, taunting Democrats as corrupt and despotic. He works at it in Capitol back rooms, hammering out policy statements so that Republicans can argue they stand for change. He nourishes it in the office of his political action committee, Gopac, with telephone hookups that enable dozens of Republican challengers around the country to tie their strategies to his. And he travels the country raising money for Republicans by preaching a gospel of lower taxes as the route to economic growth and more prisons and longer sentences as the path to domestic order.
Largely because of his efforts, the Republican campaign for House seats is more organized than it has been in years, unlike the uncertain Bush campaign. For months, Gingrich has argued openly that the President needed to do more to define his campaign goals, to call for radical change, to sound more like, well, like Gingrich. Relations with the White House have been bumpy as a result.
Yet for all the interest Gingrich claims to have in public policy issues like medical care or better schools, in his 14 years in the House he has spent most of his energy going after one colleague after another on ethical grounds. He says his motives were not partisan, but all but one of his targets have been Democrats. His biggest scalp was Jim Wright's; he brought down the Speaker of the House in 1989, accusing him of circumventing the rules by accepting payoffs and selling a pseudo-book.
He portrays himself as forced by knowledge of evil he has acquired to pursue such charges or become an accomplice. "I don't think I'm a Savanarola," the Baptist lawmaker said in an interview in May in his PAC office. "I don't think I have any great interest in running around and finding sin." But he plays very rough. He insists that one of his own aides who worked against Wright was falsely accused of spreading the rumor in 1989 that incoming Speaker Thomas S. Foley was a homosexual. The reporter who accused her, Lars-Erik Nelson of The Daily News, insists that his article was accurate and says Gingrich sent a letter to his editor, on Congressional stationery, demanding he be fired. Nor does he confine his attacks to colleagues who can fight back. He outraged Foley and many Republicans with a charge they thought far-fetched by saying a Foley aide might have participated in a coverup of corruption in the House post office.
His most strenuous campaign has been on the House bank, coaching and encouraging a group of seven Republican freshmen who made a national scandal out of a peculiar, terribly run, financial institution in which some members' deposits covered their colleagues' sometimes spectacular overdrafts. No taxpayers' money was involved, though Gingrich said the practices reflected "systemic, institutional corruption." But the growing scandal became political dynamite through a combination of Republican attacks, the inability of Speaker Foley to sense political danger and insistent newspaper and radio talk-show arguments that the dubious checks symbolized how remote Congress was from real life. That argument, however distant from the hard work, education and honesty that actually characterizes Congress today, took hold in an environment in which nothing is getting done about health care or schools or crime.
Gingrich argues that Foley's inability to recognize a "tidal wave" of public opinion caused the damage. But a tidal wave is a natural phenomenon; this was more like a forest fire, and Gingrich was there when it started, with gasoline.
His hairsbreadth victory in a July 22 Georgia Republican primary is both the best evidence of his claim to be a revolutionary, ready to take great risks, and of the potency of the enmity he has unleashed. His own 22 overdrafts, including a $9,463 check to the Internal Revenue Service, were the heaviest weapons against him in an anti-incumbent campaign waged by an underfinanced former state senator. After lavishing $1.1 million on the race, Gingrich survived, by 980 votes, and the district is so Republican that he seems a shoo-in in November. If anti-incumbency campaigns like the one waged against him defeat enough Democrats, he may someday achieve his ambition of becoming Speaker of the House. It is a goal he has nourished since his teens, when his stepfather, a combat infantryman, was transferred from Germany to Fort Benning and a bookish Newt entered politics by running a successful high-school student council campaign.
But as his own close call demonstrated, incumbent Republicans are at risk, too. The man he calls "my closest friend in the House," Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota, announced plans to retire after disclosures of 125 overdrafts. Gingrich sounds pained about Weber's decision, though Weber says Gingrich has never told him of his sorrow. "He has no desire to do me any political harm," Weber observes, and adds, "Newt's sense of the cause that he's pursuing outweighs all other causes in his mind."
REPUBLICANS OFTEN follow Gingrich out of frustration with Democratic rule. As Representative Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois Republican and hardly one of Gingrich's leading supporters, argues, House Republicans find themselves in a "legislative ghetto" where they are barely tolerated. "That can be infuriating," he says. "Even a bunny rabbit, when cornered, will fight back."
Gingrich has prodded his traditionally more accommodating boss, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the minority leader, to complain about such indignities as the fact that Democrats hog the committee staff jobs, with an average of 5.3 staffers compared with 2.6 for each Republican, and regularly write floor procedures to keep the Republicans from even offering amendments.
The fractious Democrats need those advantages, because their rank and file appears to want an organizational free lunch, complaining of weak leadership but unable to follow with any discipline. Thus, the Democrats are often barely able to find a consensus in their own party, and they don't dare risk letting a skillfully drawn amendment shatter it. Representative Frank D. Riggs of California, one of Gingrich's noisy freshmen, says he came to Congress to deal with housing and education and got into reform issues only after finding that "the legislative process is effectively closed to constructive minority input."
In all this, the House is quite different from the Senate. There, nothing gets done without bipartisan cooperation, whether it is by Robert J. Dole breaking a logjam on unemployment compensation or John C. Danforth working with Edward M. Kennedy and overcoming the Bush Administration's opposition to a civil rights bill. The Senate's rules and, even more, its traditions dictate respect for the minority. The best lawmakers there, like Kennedy and Dole and Lloyd Bentsen, know how to find allies across party lines.
But in the House, the Democrats seem oblivious to G.O.P. unhappiness. It is Gingrich who makes that cauldron of irritability boil over. As Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute says, "Newt and a handful of allies can take a polarized situation and make it 10 times worse."
AS BEFITS A Revolutionary, Gingrich cuts a rumpled figure as he races to keep appointments and catch planes. He dresses like the assistant professor he once was, carrying more books and papers than conveniently fit under his arm. His distinctive helmet of gray hair provides a low-maintenance signature; it's cut these days at Great Clips of Marietta, Ga., and dries naturally after his morning shower. His airplane reading tends to be heavy stuff: "Lincoln and the Radicals" by T. Harry Williams, "The Conservative Party From Peel to Churchill" by Robert Blake.
On the road, he stops to call his wife, Marianne, several times a day. If he finds the time, he visits local zoos. (He used speaking fees that exceeded what House rules allowed him to help the Atlanta zoo buy two baby rhinoceroses, Bo and Rosie, who have delighted his nieces, Susan and Emmy.)
He has two married daughters from his first marriage, to his high-school math teacher whom he followed after graduation to Emory University and wed. They were divorced soon after he got to Congress, with her campaign help. He married Marianne, an urban planner whom he met on a political trip to Ohio, in 1981. They live quietly in a town house in Marietta; they have a one-bedroom apartment on Capitol Hill.
The family has been little in the public eye, but last month one of the daughters, Kathy Gingrich Lubbers, made news with an abortion-rights appeal. Gingrich firmly opposes abortion and does not quarrel with his party's staunch stand against it, but Lubbers came to Washington from her home in Greensboro, N.C., where she is opening a coffee-bean roasting company, to tell a news conference sponsored by the National Republican Coalition for Choice: "If the Republican Party is to appeal to young people in general and specifically to women, we must throw off the stranglehold that the anti-choice movement has on the apparatus of the party."
She said that her father had never tried to silence her and that "our family is big enough to encompass both sides of this issue." For his part, Gingrich said, "Both my family and my party are strong enough to have healthy, spirited debates."
Gingrich came to the House from the campus of West Georgia College, where he taught history, environmental studies and a course on the future. He won his first election in 1978, on his third try, at age 35. In his speeches, he praises the college for a program it started to encourage third-graders to read by paying them $2 for every book they read and explained to an adult. He says the program shows children that reading is profitable and that adults care about it, lessons he says billions in Federal aid have never taught. He does not say that he financed the program for its first few years, from excess speaking fees.
BUT THE Gingrich revolution is not about endowing zoos, or even reading programs. This is how he defined it in a speech he gave in the House on Jan. 3; the chamber was all but empty, but he was facing the C-Span camera and its dedicated following of a couple of hundred thousand Congress addicts, an audience he has played to with after-session speeches since he arrived:
"Taking the streets back from violent crime and drugs, so local TV news is no longer a death watch, would be a revolution in every major American city. Replacing welfare with workfare and ending a process by which teen-age mothers have children outside marriage with ignorant, irresponsible male children who have sex but are not fathers would be a revolution. Having schools that are disciplined, require homework and beat the Japanese in math and science would be a revolution. Replacing the most expensive, red tape-ridden litigious health-care system in the world with a revitalized, health-oriented private system we can afford, and that would be available to everyone, would be a revolution. Having government bureaucracies that are lean, efficient, courteous and customer-service oriented would be a revolution. Having a tax code that favored work, savings and investment, that helped create more and better jobs, greater productivity and higher take-home pay to make us the fastest growing industrial economy in the world would be a revolution."
Everything on that list, except probably teen-age pregnancy, is something the Federal Government might be able to do something about. Ideas of this sort were Gingrich's passion in his first few years in Congress. With Vin Weber, he founded the Conservative Opportunity Society, and he performed for the C-Span audience, even if he didn't know anyone out there who was watching except some junior Reagan White House staffers.
That sort of follow-through and hard work have not been much in evidence lately. An 11-month effort to write a health-care bill that emphasizes private insurance and individual efforts to cut costs is about the only recent effort in the domain of ideas that he has been a part of. He has taken no action at all on the one concrete promise in his Jan. 3 speech, a commitment to find money and land for prisons so that violent offenders can be kept locked up and not turned loose because of overcrowding. Gingrich asserts he would rather work on ideas and win elections on them. But, he said in an interview in his Gopac office -- in a bland office building near the Capitol where aides prepared for that night's hookup with challengers -- building a consensus on ideas "is a backbreaking, slow, difficult process."
Nor does he think an all-out effort to spell out revolutionary ideas would help Republicans right away with the public. Such efforts, he says, would not get press attention. "It is much easier to communicate, in the current generation of news media, about scandal than about substance," he says. Moreover, conservative ideas have not been much use to House Republicans lately. After winning 192 seats with Ronald Reagan in 1980, a dozen years of supporting two of the most conservative Administrations in history have not led to further gains. Indeed, the Republicans have never won more than 182 seats since. Today's 166 leave them 52 short of a majority, only 7 ahead of where they were the morning of Reagan's election.
No one on Capitol Hill doubts that November's elections will produce more House Republicans. Reapportionment following the census has shifted seats to Republican parts of the country. The subsequent process of drawing the new district maps has helped the G.O.P., too, as Republican appointments to the Federal courts produced rulings at least neutral and sometimes friendly to Republicans when legislatures and governors could not agree.
But there is more to this year's G.O.P. hopes for the House. Active recruiting by the National Republican Congressional Committee and by Gingrich's Gopac has produced 941 Republican hopefuls, half again as many as sought nominations two years ago. Gopac's most important effort now is to find them money, not by giving it to them directly but by finding donors. In direct gifts, it can lawfully give only $10,000 to each candidate. But there is no limit to how much it can steer their way. Its goal is finding 100 donors, or people promising to raise $1,000, for each of 170 nonincumbent Republicans.
That goal will not be reached. Political money is short this year. But because of Gopac, quite a few Republican challengers will get more money than they otherwise would have. Indeed, a Federal Election Commission report this month showed that 208 Republican hopefuls had raised $50,000 by June 30, up from 114 two years ago. One who wasn't there yet, Steve Stockman, went to a lunch atop a Houston bank building where Gingrich was drumming up backing from businessmen and developers. After the pasta salad and speeches, Stockman approached one guest, former Treasury Secretary John B. Connally, and told him he was running against Jack Brooks, the formidable Galveston lawmaker who is finishing his 20th term in the House and heads the Judiciary Committee. Connally gripped his hand and said, "Give me your card and I'll send you $1,000." That night in Irvine, Calif., Gingrich's gospel of Gopac and "revolution" enlisted 35 volunteers to raise or give $1,000 from a crowd of about 400 Republicans.
Money isn't all Gingrich offers. Each Thursday night, he gets on a telephone hookup with 60 to 90 Republican challengers, offering them commentary on recent events and advice about how to campaign. Just after the Los Angeles riots, he warned them to be sure to denounce "racism, police brutality and violence," and not to forget any of the three. Then, once a month, Gingrich stages a press conference in Washington with telephone hookups to their campaign headquarters, so challengers can identify themselves with, or even claim credit for, legislative proposals like the Republican health-care plan or a bill to limit the number of years someone can receive Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
Campaigning on scandal alone may not be enough for Republican challengers if they ignore national problems, Gingrich believes. Or, as he put it in a brief appearance at a candidates' training session just before the April lunch in Houston: "Don't focus in only on scandal on the Hill. They're interesting. They're great soap opera. They're important. But they have to be attached to people's lives." To do this, he said, challengers should list the problems the Democratic Congress is not solving, like health care or jobs, and then say: "And by the way, the guys who are failing you on every front can't manage the Capitol. So they have managed to both screw up the Capitol and screw up your lives and it's their fault."
GINGRICH IS offering advice to others he hasn't followed himself, for his House career has been continually confrontational. And he has brought the House minority leader, Michel, along -- to a degree. They still offer something of a good cop, bad cop routine, with Michel as the genial veteran who can sit down and talk with Foley and Gingrich as the tough guy who boasts that polls now show only a fifth of the public approves of how Congress is doing its job. "We've accommodated pretty well to each other's different traits," Michel says. He adds that when Gingrich won his position as whip by two votes over a Michel ally in 1989, he had feared constant friction between them. He also worried that Gingrich would not attend to the basic duty of "whipping" Republicans into agreement on how to vote. "Some of the earlier concerns I had have dissipated," Michel says. "Quite frankly, we complement one another." He says he hopes that in 1993 he will be Speaker, "being credible and being respected and having a fair and even hand," while Gingrich could be the Republican majority leader "who gives the opposition fits."
That might be a relief for the next Bush Administration, if there is one, for in between his fights with Democrats, Gingrich has tangled with the President and his aides. In 1990, he took on President Bush and the rest of the Republican leadership in both houses over that year's budget agreement, which violated G.O.P. orthodoxy and Bush's own campaign promises by imposing tax increases to accompany spending cuts. In 1991 he harassed the President into asking Congress to pass capital-gains tax cuts instead of adjourning, which made Bush look silly.
But most of the time, he has assaulted Democrats, and on issues of character, not policy. In 1984, he was speaking to an empty House and a C-Span camera, attacking one Democrat after another for supposedly unpatriotic sympathies for the Sandinistas. Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. was enraged when he heard about it, and ordered the cameras to pan to show the empty chamber. Then, O'Neill took the House floor to denounce Gingrich, saying: "My personal opinion is that you deliberately stood in the well before an empty House and you challenged their patriotism, and it is the lowest thing that I have ever seen in my 32 years in the House." Gingrich won that round, when the Speaker suffered the remarkable rebuke of being ruled out of order for using unparliamentary language.
He went on to other battles, pushing the Ethics Committee or the whole House into stiffer sanctions against various Democrats and one Republican, Representative Dan Crane of Illinois, who was censured for having sex with a House page. He put less formal pressure on two other backbench Republicans to resign.
Gingrich's two-year confrontation with Wright over the propriety of the Speaker's money-making schemes had the air of a vendetta. Gingrich was outraged at Wright's personal effort to negotiate a political settlement in Nicaragua. Wright resigned after the Ethics Committee decided there were dozens of charges against him worth pursuing. Soon after, the committee rejected a counterattack from Wright's backers. They had charged that businessmen concealed campaign contributions to Gingrich with $5,000 investments in a book he wrote in 1984. They lost their money when the book did not sell.
His support among Republicans in the House is solid, stronger than when he squeaked through to the whip's job in 1989. A Connecticut moderate like Nancy Johnson sings his praises, recalling how he helped her devise parliamentary tactics to push abortion rights even though he disagreed with her aim. Scott Klug of Wisconsin, one of his freshman followers, found him encouraging on the House bank issue when many senior members were not. Gingrich told them: "If you guys think this is right, go for it." He worries some Republicans, like his friend Weber, who is troubled by the emphasis on personal attacks even as he hails Gingrich as a rare Representative who thinks about politics on a grand scale, beyond the next election or the next amendment.
Some Republicans who will not talk for attribution see him as a destructive force. They agree with Representative David R. Obey, a senior Wisconsin Democrat whom Gingrich says he respects for his diligence and trustworthiness. Obey says he sometimes sees "the ghost of Joe McCarthy" in Gingrich. "Newt enjoys smearing people's character," he says. "He contributes to the destruction of the body politic."
For years, Democrats have said his tactics amount to a desire to burn the House down, in the expectation that since it has a Democratic majority, more Democrats than Republicans will suffer and new Republicans will take their places.
That view of him is now spreading on both sides of the House. One lawmaker after another agrees with the notion that Gingrich is the political equivalent of the Air Force major in a famous interview amid the rubble of Ben Tre in South Vietnam. It was just after the Tet offensive in 1968, and the major explained, "It became necessary to destroy the town in order to save it."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Once and Future Audubon

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
The critic Reyner Banham once wrote that "architecture is that which changes land use," and in built-up cities like New York such changes can be traumatic. Taj Mahal, anyone? Not in my backyard. Even when a good building replaces an eyesore, the disruption can be painful, for it robs us of memories and violates our sense of control. For cities to work as social organisms, people need to feel a proprietary interest in their surroundings. Yet almost every ground-breaking shatters that benign illusion of ownership.
This fall, the jackhammers will start pounding on a piece of property in upper Manhattan that has aroused more than the usual amount of emotional upheaval. The Audubon Research Building, whose design has just been completed, has been a focus of controversy for a decade. The issues it has raised range from the civil rights of minorities to the possible hazards of conducting biological research in populous urban settings. These issues largely lie beyond the scope of architecture. They would remain unresolved no matter how well or badly the Audubon were designed, or even if nothing were built here. But this project is one in which architectural and social values are not easily separated. Indeed, the strength of the building's design, by Davis, Brody & Associates, is in the sensitivity with which it brings these values into coherent relationship. 
 Architecture is not the only thing that changes land use. On Feb. 21, 1965, a hail of bullets struck Malcolm X as he began to lecture from the stage of the Audubon Ballroom. With his assassination, this community meeting and recreation hall at 165th Street and Broadway was transformed into an unofficial landmark in the struggle for civil rights. That is why, when Columbia University announced plans in 1982 to demolish the ballroom and an adjacent theater to build a $22 million commercial science laboratory near Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, many viewed the proposal as an act of violence.
In a city struggling to come to grips with the causes of racial tension, the proposal to tear down the Audubon looked like one more cause. Though the building was decrepit and largely abandoned, it nonetheless overflowed with meaning, and so, alas, did Columbia's proposal. It dripped with disregard for history and for the university's responsibility to help a city heal.
Protests over the proposal forced Columbia back to the drawing boards several times, most recently in 1990, thanks to the persistence of Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger, whose approval was required for public financing. Her determination to improve the plan risked killing it altogether, but it also created an opportunity to review competing visions of a contested urban space.
To the university, the land (leased from the city) represented the potential for profit from renting space to research labs. Columbia-Presbyterian considered the facility essential to attracting research scientists to its staff. The city's Economic Development Corporation and the state's Urban Development Corporation viewed the project as a chance to increase New York's share of the booming biotechnology industry. The focus of the New York Landmarks Conservancy was the building itself, a 1913 classic of decorative art by Thomas Lamb, a leading designer of theaters in the movie palace era. For the Malcolm X Coalition to Save the Audubon Ballroom, the building was valuable because of an event that took place within it.
The Audubon controversy did not come out of nowhere. It arose from a history of tensions between Columbia University and its neighbors. As a building associated with a legendary figure of the 1960's, the Audubon inevitably evoked memories of the campus riots that erupted in 1968 in the wake of Columbia's plan to build a gymnasium in Morningside Park, a public space. And no 60's flashbacks are needed to instill distrust of Columbia-Presbyterian's expansionist ambitions. With its stark walls rising like fortress bulwarks from the streets of Washington Heights, the hospital complex is a case study in architectural alienation.
Yet possibly no one could detest the hospital's buildings more than the people who have to work inside them. And you don't have to be black to be stirred by the life of Malcolm X, rich to have a stake in economic opportunity, or a preservationist to fear change. To live in New York is to embrace contradictions, and even in the contentious atmosphere surrounding the Audubon, common interests transcended factional differences.
Ms. Messinger's mission was to map out that common ground -- and she did it successfully, as it turned out. Under the terms of a plan approved by the city Board of Estimate, Columbia agreed to retain and restore the Audubon's Broadway facade, along with its lobby and about half of the ballroom, including the stage where the assassination took place. The theater structure will be demolished. The ballroom's restored interiors will house a community health clinic as well as a memorial to Malcolm X, for which a design competition will be organized by the city's Department of Cultural Affairs. As part of the package, Columbia will also offer neighborhood job training and medical school scholarships.
Now it has fallen to Max Bond, Lewis Davis and their associates at Davis, Brody to cast this agreement in stone -- and in metal, glass and terra-cotta tile. The firm's design for the Audubon Research Building gives new meaning to the term civil engineering: it seeks to balance by formal means the competing stakes in the land the building will occupy. That balance is achieved most conspicuously in the marriage between the Audubon's restored facade and the lab tower that will rise behind it. The two halves of that marriage, though both the work of Davis, Brody, have been approached almost like separate projects. That makes sense: research in this building will proceed in two directions. The memorial will unearth the past, while, upstairs, lab workers will explore the future.
It would be tragic if the restoration work, supervised by the architect John Torborg, were not made the subject of a show. Heinrich Schliemann didn't lavish nearly so much care on his beloved Troy. Combining archival research, structural analysis and the resuscitation of nearly extinct techniques of applied decoration, this has indeed been a painstaking work of urban archeology. But the Audubon's exterior is more than a historical artifact. It also endows the project with the ready-made elements of superb urban design. The vertical rhythm supplied by Lamb's two-story window bays will make the new building (to be finished in 1994) uncommonly street-friendly. The facade's gleaming white surfaces, set off with green and yellow polychromy, banded by a cornice of gray zinc, will make it a pleasure to walk by.
Inevitably, something will be lost with this pristine re-creation of a 1913 design. It cannot match the emotional intensity of a hastily painted graffito proclaiming that "Malcolm X Lives." Though there are tentative plans to build a memorial park on a wedge-shaped plot across the street, the exterior form of the Audubon will convey no overt sign of his memory. The link between the facade and Malcolm X is that of analogy. Malcolm X's speeches called for grass-roots movements to resist the status quo. Historical preservation is such a movement; its spread to communities like Harlem and Washington Heights is also a legacy of the 1960's.
The six-story research lab, rising from behind the Audubon's facade, is a frankly Modern structure. The lab harmonizes with Lamb's architecture but makes no attempt to emulate its ornate style. Its window mullions echo Lamb's but are set on a different grid. Cast stone panels of buff, green and gray take Lamb's palette to a deeper shade, a backdrop for his polychromy.
The lab tower actually combines two blocks of labs beneath one roof. Set parallel to Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue, the six-story lab units nearly touch at the angle where St. Nicholas meets 165th Street. They are hinged together at the angle by a curved bay that contains the building's entrance.
The exterior massing, or modeling, of these elements is the key to the design's strength. What could have turned out a modern box with a period facade tacked on is instead a visually complex assemblage that changes with the vantage point: a building as multifaceted as the community it will serve. The composition is further enriched by a screen that projects the windows forward. The Audubon's front becomes, in effect, a facade joined to a facade.
Massing -- more accurately, the reduction of mass -- is also the key to the master plan for the Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Center, a complex that will eventually add several more research buildings to the blocks just north of the ballroom. The plan, also designed by Davis, Brody, seeks to alleviate the impact of Columbia-Presbyterian's fortress wall. Unlike the hospital complex, the research park will be aerated by streets passing through it. With their low roof lines and ground-floor shops, the buildings won't be blockbusters. Instead, they'll filter out into the neighborhood like ambassadors of architectural good will.
It will be a challenge for the architects to devise forms for these buildings as visually rich and urbanistically sound as those Lamb left behind. And Lamb's architecture confers another quality that defies duplication: a sense of time, and time's disruptions, a vision of architecture as a slow, patient art that is subject to change and mutation as it takes shape in the public eye. The evocation of that quality is the opportunity offered by many additions to older buildings, a type of architecture that is bound to dominate the cityscape as time goes by.
The growth of a building can be tortuous, and there's no reason why its form should not reflect that. If there are common goals that transcend competing differences, there is also an ideal of difference that can transcend common ground: diversity of opinion, of taste, of priorities that change with time. Architects should not hesitate to embody this ideal. Since the Audubon project was first proposed, it has served to bring conflicts to light, and this process will not end when the building is completed. While the master plan's additional buildings do not jeopardize historic sites, they will no doubt provide grounds for angry outbursts for years to come.
Calling forth such disagreements may in fact be as valid a function of architecture as trying to resolve them through design. The Research Building would not have attained its present design had its opponents remained silent, and if the memorial is to be more than a mute pile of cleaned-up terra cotta, we would do well to keep their contribution in mind. In that way, the building will not only memorialize a historical figure. It will also honor his exercise of a principle in which all have a stake: free speech.

HEADLINE: Law for Disabled

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your "New Federal Law For the Disabled Slow to Take Hold" on July 12 does a lot to underscore the problem of accessibility for individuals with disabilities. The accessibility standard referred to in the article is the Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG). There are over 44 million Americans with disabilities covered by the act. 
 The greatest impact in terms of achieving accessibility lies in new construction. It is in this area that the law is very clear concerning what has to be done: all new construction must comply with the standard. In addition, current estimates are that compliance will only add 1 or 2 percent to the cost of new construction. The retrofitting of facilities to comply with the standard is very often extremely expensive and on occasion may not be even feasible. But the law views "readily achievable" as an ongoing process and what is not readily achievable today may be so tomorrow, either through technological advances or increased economic resources of the entities covered by the act.

HEADLINE: Resolving Property 'Takings'

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
TWO HUNDRED AND ONE years have passed since the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution guaranteed that private property would not be "taken for public use, without just compensation." Judges, landlords and government officials are still trying to figure out exactly what that means.
Several critical cases -- involving a historic Art Deco movie theater in Philadelphia's Center City, oceanfront lots on the Isle of Palms in South Carolina and wetland acreage on Long Beach Island in Ocean County, N.J. -- suggest to some that the ill-defined line between a constitutional land-use regulation and an unconstitutional "taking" may be shifting in owners' favor. 
 "I think the courts have come to place a great value on property rights under the Constitution," said Norman Marcus, former general counsel of the New York City Planning Department and a partner at Bachner, Tally, Polevoy & Misher.
"The 50's, 60's and 70's saw greater value placed on other rights in the Bill of Rights," he said. "The 80's and 90's are seeing property rights coming to the fore."
In 1989, the New York State Court of Appeals struck down as a "taking" a New York City law that banned the conversion, alteration or demolition of single-room-occupancy hotels and required owners to restore and lease units at controlled rents. A year later, in United States Claims Court, the Loveladies Harbor development concern of Long Beach, N.J., which had been barred by the Corps of Engineers from building houses on wetland acreage, won a $2.68 million award, plus interest, on the ground that its property had been taken. The case is on appeal.
BUT there have also been decisions that support regulators. Less than a month ago, for instance, the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court upheld the landmark status of the interior of the Four Seasons restaurant in the Seagram Building. It said that a "taking" claim by the owner was without merit, since the landlord was "not substantially deprived of the economic benefit of this space."
Preservationists nationwide are awaiting, with some trepidation, a new decision from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the case of the former Boyd Theater in Philadelphia, now known as the Sam Eric. It was officially designated as historic in April 1987, subjecting it to municipal oversight akin to that given New York City landmarks.
In July 1991, the court ruled 4 to 3 that by designating the theater over the owner's objections, the Philadelphia Historical Commission had "taken" the property for public use without just compensation, violating a clause in the state constitution that is patterned on the Fifth Amendment.
A month later, the court accepted the case for reargument on the "taking" issue.
Meanwhile, designation efforts in Pennsylvania have been caught in "suspended animation," said Brent D. Glass, the state's historic preservation officer.
"If, indeed, a mere designation is a taking, you don't have to be a nuclear scientist to figure out the potential liability," said Richard Tyler, Philadelphia's historic preservation officer and executive director of the Philadelphia Historical Commission.
"Given the potential liability for a city that is not exactly awash in money," he said, "we've stopped the designation of privately-owned property, unless the owner has expressly asked that it be done."
The proposed Rittenhouse-Fitler Historic District, in and around Rittenhouse Square, with some 2,500 properties, is now on hold, as are districts planned for Society Hill, Girard Estate, Spruce Hill and Penn-Knox, which have about 5,400 properties among them.
At the heart of the controversy is a 65-year-old theater at Chestnut and 19th Streets. It appears outside to be a somewhat elegant, if faded, neighborhood cinema. Inside, it reveals itself as an ornate, cavernous, exuberant movie palace. A 1986 assessment by the commission cited "its spectacular Art Deco design, which remains almost completely intact both on the interior and exterior."
The owner at the time of designation, the Sameric Corporation, objected forcefully and sued the city. Its challenge was continued by United Artists' Theater Circuit, which now owns the building.
In rearguing its case, the City of Philadelphia cited the 1978 decision by the United States Supreme Court that upheld the landmark status of Grand Central Terminal. "Local historic preservation laws, such as Philadelphia's, do not effect a taking under the Fifth Amendment," the city said.
But United Artists' Theater Circuit said that Pennsylvania courts "have applied a stricter standard to 'taking' than the Federal courts" and that "private property occupies a more hallowed ground in our Constitution than it does under the Federal Constitution."
To the extent that the Boyd Theater case rests on the Pennsylvania constitution, it would be more difficult to appeal in Federal courts and, perhaps, more insulated from legal battles in other states.
Laurie Beckelman, the chairwoman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, said she was not worried about any effects locally. "I feel very confident, in looking at case law in New York, that we're in very good shape," she said.
BUT Jerold S. Kayden, a lawyer and senior fellow at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy in Cambridge, Mass., noted that if the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held to its finding of a taking, "private-property advocates can act like constitutional Johnny Appleseeds, attempting to sow the Pennsylvania message in state after state."
A "taking" is apparent enough when the state condemns property under its power of eminent domain, compensates the owners, empties the land of occupants and uses the property for a new high school, a highway right-of-way or an urban renewal project.
Far less clear is the extent to which a regulation amounts to a "taking," when an owner still possesses property but is greatly restricted in using it.
Two months ago, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of David H. Lucas, a developer. He bought two lots on the Isle of Palms in 1986 for $975,000, with the view of building single-family houses on them. But the state's Beachfront Management Act, enacted in 1988, prohibited the construction of permanent habitable structures on the property.
In a 6-to-3 opinion, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court said that "when the owner of real property has been called upon to sacrifice all economically beneficial uses in the name of the common good, that is, to leave his property economically idle, he has suffered a taking."
The justices decided the case under the factual assumption, accepted by the South Carolina courts but disputed by Justice Harry A. Blackmun and others, that Mr. Lucas's lots had been "rendered valueless" under the coastal-zone construction ban.
Justice Scalia and his colleagues in the majority -- Sandra Day O'Connor, William H. Rehnquist, Clarence Thomas and Byron R. White, with Anthony M. Kennedy concurring -- stopped short of declaring that Mr. Lucas had actually suffered a taking, however.
Rather, they returned the case to the South Carolina courts, saying that in order to win its case, the state would have to demonstrate that, even before the 1988 ban, there were existing "background principles of nuisance and property law that prohibit the uses he now intends in the circumstances in which the property is presently found."
Dissenting from the opinion, Justice Blackmun called it "a missile to kill a mouse," and said, "My fear is that the court's new policies will spread beyond the narrow confines of the present case." Justice John Paul Stevens also dissented and Justice David H. Souter filed a separate statement.
Interpretations vary as to the significance of Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council. A forum, "After Lucas," moderated by Mr. Marcus, is scheduled Sept. 17, at 6 P.M., in the New York County Lawyers Association building, 14 Vesey Street, near Broadway.
Mr. Lucas's lawyer, A. Camden Lewis, of Lewis, Babcock & Hawkins in Columbia, S.C., said the court's instruction to focus on "background principles" -- that is, what owners could have expected to do with property at the time of purchase -- "will really help landowners in the long run."
HE also said the opinion "set up a guideline that hadn't heretofore been established," which he defined as follows: "A regulation will always be a taking if it takes away all valuable economic use."
Justices Blackmun and Stevens view this development warily. The rule may "greatly hamper the efforts of local officials and planners who must deal with increasingly complex problems in land-use and environmental regulation," Justice Stevens said.
"The threshold inquiry for imposition of the court's new rule, 'deprivation of all economically valuable use,' itself cannot be determined objectively," Justice Blackmun wrote. "As the court admits, whether the owner has been deprived of all economic value of his property will depend on how 'property' is defined."
"The issue of what is the property interest at stake is going to be a whole new battleground," Mr. Kayden said. "Defining what the property is determines whether the owner wins or loses."
For example, if the developer of a 100-acre rural tract were required to leave 90 percent of it in a natural state, how would the court define the affected property? Would it be the 90 acres that the government had frozen, or the parcel as a whole, within which 10 acres provide an economic return?
This question has particular relevance to the Loveladies Harbor case, in which the developer was barred from building on a 12.5-acre portion of a 250-acre parcel, most of which had already been developed.
IT also is key to the case of Grand Central Terminal, whose landmark status was upheld by the New York Court of Appeals in 1977 and the United States Supreme Court in 1978, against a "taking" claim by the owner, the Penn Central Transportation Company.
In that case, the courts considered the parcel as a whole, saying that even if the terminal could not operate at a reasonable profit, some income from Penn Central's real estate holdings in the area "must realistically be imputed to the terminal."
In Footnote 7 of the Lucas opinion, the justices described this as "an extreme -- and, we think, unsupportable -- view."
"That suggests that Penn Central is in doubt," said Richard A. Samp, chief counsel of the Washington Legal Foundation. About Loveladies Harbor, he said, "The fact that development proceeded in separate tracts and the specific decision by the Corps applied only to this one discrete parcel suggests that, under Footnote 7, the developer will win."
Other than the issue of property definition, however, Mr. Kayden said the Lucas case was "old wine in old bottles."
"The legal reasoning follows pretty squarely on existing Supreme Court jurisprudence," he said. "Further, it's a very narrow decision because it applies only in the case of a 100-percent wipeout. And that situation occurs quite rarely."
"Nothing in the Lucas decision affects routine forms of land-use regulation," said Stephen Neal Dennis, executive director of the National Center for Preservation Law.
For the New York City Planning Department, the message from the Lucas case was that "we need to be very careful as to how we regulate," the counsel, William Valletta, said. But he added, "I don't think it ultimately is going to change the outcomes."
Because the High Court reached no definitive decision, the South Carolina Coastal Council is conducting "business as usual" in regulating beaches, wetlands and coastal waterways, said a spokeswoman, Donna Gress. She noted that under a 1990 revision to the beachfront act, Mr. Lucas would be entitled to apply for a construction permit, although there is no guarantee he would get one.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Tara on Campus;
Westchester Irish Center

 BODY:
A vision of Tara, the ancient seat of Irish kings, is obviously on the minds of a group of Irish investors who have signed a $14 million contract to purchase the 57-acre main campus of King's College in the Westchester village of Briarcliff Manor.
Their plan is to transform the campus into a site for Gaelic football and hurling games, as well as art and drama programs and a genealogy center. 
 "This was a unique opportunity to group a wide selection of Irish cultural activities in one location," said Edward Sheeran, chairman of Tara Circle, the investors' group. Mr. Sheeran is also president of Rockfield Corporation, a golf resort development company.
Several months ago, Tara Circle started looking for a site for Irish sporting events, which used to be played at the now-shuttered Gaelic Park in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
When they found the Briarcliff Manor site, with three athletic fields, a library, gym, banquet halls and a music building, they expanded their plan to suit the accommodations.
The group paid $150,000 last month toward a required $700,000 down payment. The remainer is due in two installments. The balance of the purchase price is expected to be financed by bonds issued through Westchester County's Industrial Development Agency.
According to Mr. Sheeran, the group has already raised $1 million from Irish groups for the project.
The campus was for sale because Kings College is moving to Warwick in Orange County.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Wall Street Leasing;
Cooling a Securities Firm's Wanderlust

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
"IF the economics are comparable, then we get to the convenience issue," said William J. Ahearn, first vice president of Prudential Securities. The economics were made comparable, in the end, with those in Jersey City by tax relief granted by New York City, so downtown Manhattan was free to prove itself on the convenience issue. No trouble there.
Mr. Ahearn was elaborating on the decision-making process that led the nation's third largest securities firm to make a major commitment to the Wall Street area, announced by Mayor David N. Dinkins on Aug. 5. The company is taking a million square feet of space in Chase Manhattan Bank's 2.1-million-square-foot tower at One Water Street, known as One New York Plaza, at the Battery. And it is renewing its lease on 500,000 square feet in Jack Resnick & Sons' One Seaport Plaza, or 199 Water Street, near South Street Seaport. 
 It amounts to a downtown consolidation more than a great expansion. The company is currently in 11 locations with 1.4 million square feet. It is keeping only its Seaport Plaza presence, and giving up locations that include 100 Gold Street, where it has 500,000 square feet, and 127 John Street, with 160,000 square feet.
Still, the decision by Prudential Securities to keep its operations in Manhattan is an important plus for the downtown market, where the latest figures from brokerage houses show that about 20 percent of the space is available. One New York Plaza had one of the largest single blocks of readily available space.
The decision demonstrates that in the current market lower Manhattan can offer costs that are competitive with New Jersey's. That requires cooperation by government, since it is in the area of taxes and energy costs specifically that New York City has been uncompetitive. Tenants still will pay more in New York City to outfit the space they lease, since labor costs are about 20 percent higher than New Jersey's, said Rodger G. Parker, senior vice president for real estate of Prudential Securities.
Mr. Parker was also the senior real estate official at Paine Webber in 1985, when it was deciding where to consolidate its 10 New York City operations. Paine Webber ultimately kept its headquarters and other front-office functions in Manhattan and moved back-office operations to Hartz Mountain's Lincoln Harbor development in Weehawken, N.J.
"Economics drove that deal, too," said Mr. Parker. Three thousand jobs were lost in New York City.
Abatements alone do not make buildings competitive, of course. Chase Manhattan Bank is spending about $50 million on improvements to the lobby, elevator cabs and plaza at One New York Plaza, and an additional $50 million on asbestos removal.
Asbestos-removal costs were a key factor in an assessment reduction won by Chase in a court suit. They vary widely depending on specific conditions in a building, and were a notably high $25 a square foot at One New York Plaza, said Joel R. Marcus, of the Manhattan firm of Pottish & Freyberg, who represented Chase in the suit.
The court cut the assessment to $85 million from $170 million for the contested period, lowering property taxes to about $3.50 a square foot from almost double that amount, Mr. Marcus said. Refund money will help pay for asbestos removal costs, he said.
Beyond that, the city and the Power Authority of the State of New York put together an abatement package worth at least $106 million over 20 years, leading to an average rent of about $28.50 a square foot per year for Prudential Securities. The figure represents base rent plus annual taxes and the tenant's share of operating costs.
In addition, Prudential Securities itself is investing $147 million to prepare its new One New York Plaza space -- almost $150 a square foot. Most of the money is for a data center, trading floor and special generators to assure uninterrupted power. Company headquarters will stay at One Seaport Plaza.
TWO major attractions for Prudential Securities were the building's large floors -- the company is taking the 16 floors in the base of the building, with 62,000 square feet on each floor -- and the availability of the space by 1994, when existing leases expire and the move-in gets under way. The firm's consultants were Joseph Hilton & Associates and LaSalle Partners, both of Manhattan.
"Today downtown needs government stimulus -- a cost structure that makes it competitive," said Martin Turchin of Edward S. Gordon, representing Chase. Instead of the $10 to $14 a square foot per year normally spent on taxes and electricity on a big lease for a heavily computerized brokerage operation, these costs to the tenant must be held to $7 or $8 a square foot, Mr. Turchin said.
This makes it possible more or less to match the fixed taxes over 15 years offered in Jersey City enterprise zones, he said. But the competition is not from the New York region alone. Prudential Securities considered moving back-office operations to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston and West Virginia before narrowing the field to Colgate-Palmolive's 42-acre Jersey City development and lower Manhattan, Mr. Parker said.
The vacancy rate downtown closely reflects the employment situation in the financial services industry and activities related to it. One baromter of this is the employment level in the securities industry and the commodities business in the city, which is tracked by the Federal States Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Employment stands at about 125,000, the bureau says, and it has stabilized this year after a decline since 1987. But it has stabilized at about 125,000 jobs, down 23 percent from the peak of 163,000 in 1987. Most are in the financial district.
"Employment is about where it was in 1985," said said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner. "It hasn't erased the gains of the 70's or before."
Vacancy figures reflect the post-recession business bankruptcies and consolidations that set off the employment drop. Edward S. Gordon, the brokerage firm, counts the inventory below Canal Street as 91 million square feet of rentable space. It says 20.3 million of it is available. In the financial district proper (excluding the City Hall area and the World Trade Center) 15 million square feet of a total of 55 million square feet is available, the firm says. Much of the space is concentrated in a handful of buildings, some with problems that prevent current marketing.
Cushman & Wakefield, another brokerage, finds a downtown vacancy rate of 18 percent in primary buildings and 22 percent in secondary buildings.
A new 12-year tax exemption on renovation work in commercial buildings south of 96th Street should help many buildings. The law allows a 100 percent abatement on taxes attributable to the post-improvement assessment increase for eight years, phasing out to zero abatement over the next four years. North of 23d Street the incentive expires in July 1994. To the south it is good until 1999.
Jon Lukomnik, assistant commissioner of finance, said that the cost of asbestos removal would be calculated as an expense item that lowers a building's net income -- the basis of assessment calculations. In this way a portion of the cost will recovered by the building over 10 years.
One New York Plaza is not the only building facing big costs, including asbestos removal, to remain competitive.
Olympia & York Properties, with well-publicized problems internationally, has told investors who hold notes secured by 55 Water Street, a 53-story development with 3.2 million square feet of space, that 1.5 million square feet of leases are coming due in mid-1993. And 650,000 square feet more will be available by the end of 1997.
The cost of preparing this space for tenants could total $100 million to $200 million or more over five years, the bondholders were told.
And at 55 Broad Street, the Rudin Organization has spent heavily for an asbestos clean-up and other work in a building that was emptied in the aftermath of a move-out by Drexel Burnham & Company. About 387,000 square feet is now on the market.
"We're negotiating with four tenants," said Lewis Rudin. "Hopefully we will make one or two deals. If we don't, we'll keep plugging."

30 More Affordables

 BODY:
One of the oldest community development corporations in New York City, Hope Community Inc., has opened a 30-unit affordable housing complex called Hope Place at 415 East 115th Street in East Harlem.
The development is an important phase in a community-planned strategy to revitalize 115th Street between First and Pleasant Avenues. Thus far, three buildings with 62 units have been completed by the 24-year-old organization, each with the help of more than $500,000 in low-interest loans and grants from the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, as well as $1.1 million in equity from the New York Equity Fund.
"This is one more thing on a whole block that is turning around," said Joan Lebow, a spokesperson for the Local Initiatives entity. 
 Hope Place opened last month and now is totally occupied. It has studios and one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, with 30 percent of the apartments set aside for the homeless. Rents range from $328 to $489 a month. The architect is Herbert L. Mandel of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Auto Insurance: Another View

 BODY:
In his letter to the New Jersey editor on July 19, responding to the article "No-Frills Insurance Proposed for Cars," attorney Paul Hofmann criticized the recent proposals to reduce the minimum liability requirements for New Jersey drivers, contending that innocent victims could suffer "severe financial hardships." 
 What he failed to consider was that many drivers today simply cannot afford the state's current high minimum coverage requirements. As a result, an estimated half-million New Jersey motorists are driving around without any auto insurance. It is these drivers who pose the greatest threat to bankrupting the so-called innocent victims -- not to mention themselves -- should they become involved in accidents.
By lowering the minimum liability requirements, the state can make insurance more affordable and thus encourage more drivers to purchase at least basic policies. Anyone worried about being hit by a driver without substantial liability coverage or a driver with no insurance can purchase additional personal injury protection coverage.
The mini-policies currently being debated are designed to provide drivers with greater options and to help insure that those with limited resources are not priced out of the auto insurance market. By various means, these policies would also help control lawsuits for non-economic loss, a leading generator of high costs that all insured drivers must share.
The American Insurance Association, whose companies write about one-third of New Jersey's total property-casualty insurance premium volume, urges the administration and the Legislature to take a closer look at these mini-policies and support the insurance industry's effort to develop a system that will help make insurance more affordable.

HEADLINE: Doubts Plague Mortgage Plan For Firefighters and the Police

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
WHEN the Residential Mortgage Investment Program was signed into law by Gov. Jim Florio in January, it was hailed by all concerned. It permitted police officers and firefighters to tap into their pension system for mortgages carrying very low interest rates.
But since then, the program has created confusion and dissension in the ranks of the state's 35,000 uniformed employees. 
 The program allows a police officer or a firefighter to borrow up to $175,000 from the $5.7 billion pension fund for financing a first-time home purchase or for refinancing an existing mortgage on a home. The employee would pay an interest rate of 5.57 percent, while current rates are about 8 percent.
"Some people look at this like it's the greatest thing since Scotch and water," said William Flynn, president of the Firemen's Mutual Benevolent Association, a Rahway-based union with 5,000 members statewide. "But we're telling members to be very cautious because there are just too many unanswered questions."
One of those unanswered questions, Mr. Flynn said, is whether the Internal Revenue Service will treat the mortgage as a taxable distribution of retirement funds. That uncertainty might be expected to discourage some who would apply for the loans, but they are also aware that the money available is limited to 10 percent of the pension fund -- so if they hesitate too long, they may miss out.
Some union leaders are concerned that the program will upset the stability of the pension fund itself. As a result, the program has created something of a generational split, with older employees who are closer to drawing their pensions opposing it, and younger employees favoring it.
The law, which was sponsored by State Senator John A. Lynch, Democrat of New Brunswick, allows state pension officials to set aside 10 percent of the Police and Firemen's Retirement System for the mortgages. The retirement fund, which was recently valued at $5.7 billion, has about 35,000 active members.
Police union officials say the pension mortgage program was developed not only to provide low-interest mortgages to members, but also to help stimulate the state's real-estate and construction industries.
"It will put people to work, it's a good move for the economy and it certainly benefits police and firemen," said Frank Casey, consulting coordinator for the state Policemen's Benevolent Association.
 
Low Interest Rate
 The program is being administered by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, an autonomous state agency that administers other low-interest mortgage programs for residential real estate.
Jerry Keelen, assistant director of single-family programs for the agency, said the interest rate for mortgages granted under the program was based on the average yield of United States Treasury bills plus two percentage points. Currently, Mr. Keelen said, the interest rate for a pension mortgage stands at 5.57 percent.
Mr. Keelen said that 25 percent of the funds earmarked for the program was intended for first-time home buyers, with the rest available for refinancing existing mortgages. A first-time home buyer is defined as someone who has not owned a home within the last three years.
About 20 mortgage companies doing business in the state are now taking applications for the mortgages. The companies are allowed to charge only an application fee, which averages about $300, and a flat charge of $1,500 instead of the "points" that are typically charged for mortgages. Each point is 1 percent of the mortgage amount, and lenders usually charge borrowers several points to process a mortgage.
 
Flood of Applications
 In addition, Mr. Keelen said, there is a $325 one-time charge that must be paid by borrowers to his agency to cover the costs of administering the program, and there is also a $30 monthly fee to cover the costs of processing loan payments and to maintain tax, insurance and foreclosure escrows.
Though no mortgages have yet been issued under the program, Mr. Keelen said, "there are literally millions of dollars' worth of applications at the banks."
Most of those, he said, are for refinancing of existing mortgages. "Our projection is that the average loan will be $125,000 and that we'll probably have a maximum of about 4,000 loans," he said, referring to both refinancings and new home purchases.
As an example of the potential savings the new program could provide, a $125,000 30-year loan at an interest rate of 10 percent, not uncommon for an existing mortgage, would cost $1,097 a month. A new 8 percent loan, which is the current conventional mortgage rate, would cost $917 a month. On the other hand, a 5.57 percent loan, the current rate for the pension mortgage program, would cost $715.
 
Substantial Savings
 The difference between a $125,000 30-year loan taken out today at 8 percent and the same loan taken out at 5.57 percent, when paid over the full 30 years, amounts to $72,720.
But some state and union officials are concerned that the Internal Revenue Service might interpret the use of pension funds for private mortgages as a distribution that is subject to income taxes and penalties. Such an interpretation, if upheld by the courts, could cost borrowers many thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties.
Anticipating that problem, the state treasurer's office hired a Washington law firm that specializes in taxes, Arnold & Porter, to determine whether the borrowed money would be taxable. The firm issued an opinion stating that it believed that the mortgages should not be treated as taxable distributions, but then added an ominous caveat.
"You must be aware that the Internal Revenue Service likely would not agree with our opinion, and that, upon audit, the conclusions reached may be challenged," the opinion stated.
 
Concerns Over Tax Status
 Edward J. McBride Jr., an assistant counsel to Governor Florio, said the opinion "speaks for itself" about the possibility that borrowers could be taxed at some point in the future.
"The question that no one can give an answer to at all is whether the I.R.S. will ever say anything about it," Mr. McBride said. "That's not even a legal call."
To alert prospective borrowers to the potential problem, Mr. McBride said, every application package contains a form warning of possible taxes and penalties and advising the applicant to consult with his or her own tax adviser.
But those who want to participate in the program feel a certain sense of urgency despite the unresolved tax question.
Vincent Frammigen, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, a 12,000-member organization of police and corrections officers, said that because of the limited amount of money available, fewer than 15 percent of the pension fund's members would be able to take advantage of the program.
 
Dangers of Real Estate
 Another concern voiced by union officials is that the program will undermine the stability of the pension fund.
"This is no time to be investing in mortgages," Mr. Flynn of the Firemen's Mutual Benevolent Association said. "The economy is just not right. You can go down any street in any town and see houses that are boarded up because of foreclosures."
The last thing the pension fund needs, Mr. Flynn said, is to end up owning houses that it had to take back because borrowers defaulted on their loans. And that, he said, is a distinct possibility, given the potential for layoffs of police officers and firefighters in municipalities strapped for cash.
Peter Smith, president of the 5,500-member New Jersey chapter of the International Association of Fire Fighters, said the younger members were in favor of the program while the more senior members were opposed to it because of concern about the future stability of the pension fund.
"At first blush, we thought this would be a great idea," Mr. Smith said. "But the more we looked into it, the less attractive it became."
 
Support From Police Union
 Some police union officials, on the other hand, staunchly support the program.
"I see no real drawbacks to this," Mr. Casey of the Policemen's Benevolent Association said. "I don't see anything wrong with a policeman getting a mortgage if the money's available and then paying it back like he would to a normal bank."
Mr. Casey added that officials of the Policemen's Benevolent Association, after conferring with tax experts, were confident that the income tax issue would not be a problem. "As far as we know," he said, "our president is telling the membership that the problem is corrected."
The president of the association, Frank Ginesi, did not return several telephone calls seeking his comment.
In the view of Mr. Frammigen, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, the tax issue is still very much alive. He cited the state's requirement that applicants sign documents indicating their awareness of potential tax liability.
"That's getting everybody off the hook except the person who's applying for the mortgage," Mr. Frammigen said.
One potential applicant who has not yet filed is Michael T. Cranwell, a Union City fire captain who wants to refinance his existing mortgage. "I'm on hold until I find out definitely what's going on," he said. "I just knew this sounded too good to be true."

HEADLINE: As Global Talks Stall, Regional Trade Pacts Multiply

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Colombian roses will be more available in Venezuela, Israeli shoes will be more common in Central Europe and Mexican watermelons will be cheaper in the United States. The reason: a striking proliferation of regional free-trade deals.
Countries around the world have signed and ratified more such agreements in the last five years than in the preceding decade. And an even larger batch of regional deals, including the North American Free Trade Agreement that was formally announced by the United States, Mexico and Canada 11 days ago, have been recently struck by negotiators and are at various stages of approval. 
 With the end of the cold war and the stagnation of negotiations aimed at simultaneously lowering trade barriers globally, these regional pacts are emerging as the trade side of what has been widely called the New World Order. The success or failure of these arrangements will help determine economic growth and consumer prices around the world, affecting people in ways from the jobs they hold to the price of vegetables at the local supermarket.
Whether the regional trade agreements are a good thing is a matter of some debate. Many economists worry that they may lead to an undermining of global free-trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 103-nation pact that has set the world's free-trade rules since 1947. They also fear a rise in protectionism as countries use regional agreements to steer business toward their allies, instead of buying goods from whatever country produces them most cheaply.
"My judgment is that the revival of regionalism is unfortunate," wrote Jagdish Bhagwati, an economics professor at Columbia University and special adviser to the GATT, in a paper presented at a recent World Bank conference. "But, given its political appeal and its likely spread, I believe that it is important to contain and shape it" through GATT rules barring protectionist clauses in the agreements.
But the Bush Administration and some academic economists say that the agreements are not a problem, at least in principle, and a book by an M.I.T. scholar, published last week, suggests that regional free-trade deals are better than no free trade at all, and that they help countries force other countries to open their markets.
"I've never heard anyone in the Administration suggesting that regional agreements are a substitute for multilateral agreements -- they can and should be complementary," said Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
The strongest views in favor of regional free-trade pacts come from business groups that see them as a way for the United States to demand deep concessions from its trading partners, while threatening loss of access to the American market if these demands are not met. American officials have been reluctant to pursue this strategy in the GATT, where the American market counts for less.
"Everybody gets caught up with principles instead of threatening retaliation; with some of these countries in the GATT, you can't deal with them civilly," said Harvey E. Bale Jr., the pharmaceutical industry's chief lobbyist on trade issues and a former Reagan Administration trade negotiator.
Whatever the consequences, the rapid spread of free-trade pacts is remarkable. During the past year in the Western hemisphere, five Andean nations have agreed to form a free-trade area, Chile has struck deals with Argentina and Mexico and is negotiating with Venezuela and Costa Rica, and Canada and the United States have agreed to add Mexico to their free-trade area.
Nor is the trend limited to the Americas. The countries of Southeast Asia set up a free-trade area last January, while 11 countries around the Black Sea are moving in that direction. Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland have announced plans to negotiate a free-trade area. The seven-nation European Free Trade Association, or E.F.T.A., has inked separate deals with Israel, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary.
Even the granddaddy of all free-trade areas, the European Community, is joining the tide. It struck a deal last October to eliminate trade barriers with the E.F.T.A.
Little economic research has been done on why the explosion in free-trade pacts should happen now. Yet five basic reasons appear to explain the new profusion:
* The end of the cold war has shattered the economic ties of former Communist countries and left them to form new alliances which tend to be free-trade deals with neighbors and Western countries.
* Latin American countries have been lowering their trade barriers unilaterally to encourage imports of cheap foreign equipment and other goods that make their own industries more efficient and internationally competitive. Once the barriers have been lowered considerably, free-trade pacts require little additional effort.
* Nations in existing regional agreements are bringing in their neighbors to offer larger markets to companies within their borders. The European Community once meant free trade among six northern European countries, but now includes 12 countries extending the length and breadth of Western Europe, and will involve 19 countries when the pact with the E.F.T.A. is concluded.
* Trade agreements mimic cross-border investment patterns, said Karl P. Sauvant, a senior United Nations economist. Big companies increasingly assemble manufactured goods in many countries from parts made in many countries. These corporations are demanding that their international production patterns be protected by trade pacts insuring that restrictions are not imposed on shipments of vital parts and finished goods.
* After years of viewing agreements overseas as plots to exclude American exports, the United States is beginning to forge its own agreements and take a benevolent view at least toward similar deals in Latin America. President Bush has set forth a vision of a free-trade area extending from the Arctic to Tierra del Fuego.
But what the Administration may welcome in principle and at home in the Western Hemisphere, it does not always greet abroad. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who today becomes White House chief of staff, recently delivered a stiff warning against trade deals in Southeast Asia that might keep American goods out of one of the world's fastest-growing economic regions.
Mr. Baker's concern over Southeast Asia reflects the concern many academic economists have about creating regional agreements to steer business toward allies instead of the cheapest producer. Since the publication of a famous book, "The Customs Unions Issue," by Jacob Viner, in 1950, economists have generally agreed that free-trade pacts are bad if they divert more existing trade to neighbors than they create in new trade.
Creating trade is good because it allows each country to specialize in those products it makes most efficiently, thereby increasing world economic output. Diverting trade to regional allies is bad, economists agree, because the allies may make goods that could be produced more efficiently elsewhere.
Yet fears of regional agreements may be overblown. After many years of alarms that the European Community may systematically exclude American goods, the fact remains that American exports to the community have more than doubled in the last six years, while imports from the community have risen only 27.3 percent. As a result, the United States has gone from an $18.65 billion trade deficit with these countries in 1985 to a surplus of $16.73 billion last year.
Part of the improvement may reflect the precipitous fall in the value of the United States dollar since 1985. But economic studies of the European Community have consistently shown that, with the conspicuous exception of farm products, the community has created more international trade than it has diverted.
Many of the same worries about protectionism are being raised about the North American Free Trade Agreement by some conservative analysts. Attention has focused on rules that limit eligibility for lower tariffs to goods produced mainly in North America.
Negotiators in Geneva have been stalled for two years in trying to produce a global free-trade accord. A strong argument in favor of pursuing regional accords while waiting for progress in Geneva is set forth in a just-published book by Kenneth A. Oye, director of the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the book, "Economic Discrimination and Political Exchange: World Political Economy in the 1930's and 1980's" (Princeton University Press), Mr. Oye criticizes the popular notion that regional trading blocs worsened the Great Depression.
Mr. Oye notes the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 raised tariffs on all imports. Other countries were more selective, keeping tariffs low for neighbors or former colonial possessions so as to hold on to those markets. The result was a plunge in the American share of world exports to 10.3 percent in 1933 from 15.6 percent in 1929.
American exporters responded by lobbying successfully for the Regional Trade Agreement Act of 1934, under which the Roosevelt Administration negotiated deals with France and 10 Latin American countries. The expansion of regional trade then was better than no trade, Mr. Oye contends, adding that this argument applies today.
"The stagnation at the level of the GATT quite naturally leads to bilateral and regional bargaining, and I'm saying that's not bad, insofar as the second-best approach can and does lead to increased openness," he said in an interview.
But other economists, led by Mr. Bhagwati, contend that this view underestimates the enormous reductions in worldwide tariffs on manufactured goods that the GATT has already engineered.
 
 
PLAYING BY THE RULES OF ORIGIN
 Largely unnoticed in the debate over regional free-trade agreements is that almost every one has some rules, known as rules of origin, that require that goods be produced within the participating nations to qualify for lower tariffs.
The rules are intended to prevent nations outside the agreement from taking advantage of the lower tariffs. Mexico, for example, has a 10 percent tax on imported asparagus while the United States has a 25 percent tax. The North American accord will eliminate these taxes over 15 years only for asparagus grown in North America. But the taxes had to stay in place for imports from Peru and other countries, so those countries could not circumvent the higher American tariffs by shipping their asparagus to the United States by way of Mexico.
The preference given to Mexican asparagus could cost Peru some sales; indeed, Latin American, Asian and Caribbean nations worry that the North American trade agreement will cost them exports even if they are more efficient producers.
Some European countries have used rules of origin more restrictive than the North American agreement's. For example, the North American accord requires that at least 50 percent of the value of a car be produced in North America for it to qualify for duty-free treatment, and that percentage will rise to 62.5 percent over eight years.
The Ford Motor Company, which wanted a higher standard, complains that when Nissan recently set up a factory in England, France required that at least 80 percent of the cars' value be produced within the borders of European Community countries. To be sure, the French rules for counting local content then were less restrictive than the North American agreement's, but not enough to outweigh a difference of 17.5 percentage points.

The Companies That Make Money From Making Money

BYLINE: By DAVID BERREBY; David Berreby is a Brooklyn-based freelance writer.

 BODY:
Brand-new American products are scarce in the former Soviet Union, but by next month almost every Lithuanian will be using some. The litas, Lithuania's new currency, is made in the U.S.A.
Like the paper currencies of Malaysia, Haiti, Venezuela and a score of other nations, the litas is a product of the United States Banknote Corporation. Its main office is in Manhattan and it prints in plants in Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles (where the 100-litu note, featuring a handsome scene of a peaceful Lithuanian town, was printed). 
 In fact, if history is any guide, the crisp, fresh bills that new regimes and resurrected nations are expected to put into circulation soon will be printed mostly by companies, not government presses.
Whether they are creating a new monetary unit, redesigning notes that now bear the "wrong" portrait or just replacing bills after their 15 months or so of life, all but about 30 countries in the world rely on a small, interlocked world of "security printers."
Such changes are good news for these companies, whose bread and butter was once stock certificates. With stock transactions becoming more and more computerized, the bulk of business and the growth at U.S. Banknote, the largest security printer in the United States, is in currency, travelers' checks and government documents like food stamps, according the Stanley Kreitman, president. Not to mention the holograms that are now placed on many credit cards, another U.S. Banknote product. The company -- the result of a merger in 1990 between United States Banknote and the International Banknote Company -- earned $4.7 million on revenues of $161 million last year.
Winning a government's order for currency "is really like selling any other industrial-type product," said Mark Crickett, divisional marketing manager for currency for Thomas De La Rue & Company. "It's a very specialized type of printed document, but you market it on quality, reliability, price, as you would any other."
Thomas De La Rue, a subsidiary of London-based De La Rue P.L.C., is the leader among money printers, with more than 90 nations among its clients. It had net income of $80 million on revenues of $646 million in the fiscal year that ended March 31.
Mr. Crickett declined to talk about any of his customers specifically. According to the Standard Catalog of World Paper Money, a publication for collectors, De La Rue's clients include Hong Kong, Guyana, Haiti, Peru and both pre- and post-revolutionary Nicaragua. (Substituting Sandino for Somoza on the 1,000-cordoba note posed no great problem for De La Rue's engravers and designers).
 
Push That Sale!
Marketing Counts, As Does Unrest
 As with any other product, marketing is important to the money-printing business, and U.S. Banknote has a well-traveled sales staff of four devoted to currency, Mr. Kreitman said. It paid off in the Baltic, where his company won Lithuania's business and a share of Estonia's, even though other companies, including De La Rue, Giesecke & Devrient of Munich and Johan Enschede en Zonen of the Netherlands, have closer offices and printing plants.
"It was good old-fashioned American salesmanship," said Mr. Kreitman, who declined to reveal the specifics of the litas contract.
Price, service and incentives are the key elements, Mr. Kreitman said. While money does not go on sale, "sometimes, we'll provide financing," he said. Payment, of course, is not taken in product samples, but by a letter of credit for a hard currency.
The unit of sale is a thousand bills, Mr. Kreitman said, and currency usually costs $26 to $45 per thousand to make, depending on what optional features a government orders, either to foil counterfeiters or for other reasons. (Some of Israel's shekels printed by Johan Enschede, for example, have special bumps for blind people to read.)
How much a country orders depends on its population and, more important, its inflation rate, said Mr. Kreitman, "though an order is rarely for less than 50 million notes."
For currency printers, like undertakers and journalists, upheaval and tumult are good for business.
"When inflation really got bad, there were Latin American countries in the 1980's whose largest imports were paper money," said David C. Harper, editor of The Bank Note Reporter, a monthly publication for currency collectors published by Krause Publications in Iola, Wis. The need to remove suddenly unpopular symbols can spur new orders sooner than replacement for normal wear and tear would require, he said.
It's only natural, then, that currency-makers have followed developments in the former Communist world with interest. The Baltic Republics, which declared their independence first, have already provided business. By far the biggest order so far, though, is from Ukraine, which will soon introduce a national currency, the grivna. Last fall, the new nation ordered 1.5 billion notes from the Canadian Bank Note Company of Ottawa, for $36 million (Canadian). The company is a privately held concern that prints some of Canada's own currency (another private company does the rest) and for "five to ten" other countries, said Shirley Arends, a company vice president.
Shipments are expected to arrive in Ukraine in October and again in January, she said. Given the Ukrainian inflation rate, she said, "We think they'll be looking for further notes beyond their initial order."
Earlier this month, the company signed a contract to print currency for Tajikistan.
But the Ukrainian and Baltic orders have been exceptions. So for now, currency makers are seeking other opportunities.
For example, "We also have contracts for stock certificates for the Central Moscow Stock Exchange and the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange," Mr. Kreitman said. And, based on the state of negotiations when the Yugoslav war began, he said, "once the situation settles down I assume we'll be doing Croatia."
 
Counterfeiting
Color Printers Pose New Problems
 During World War II, one of Germany's master engravers was enlisted, along with a gang of conscripts, by the Nazis to churn out counterfeit British pound notes. That continued a style of economic warfare that had been tried much earlier by the British themselves against American rebels.
In June, the issue surfaced again in a congressional Republican task force on terrorism which accused Iran of printing high-quality fake $100 bills. (The Iranians denied the charge.)
The currency enemy now is not so much the experienced forger but the ordinary criminal with access to advanced color photocopiers and computers.
Cynthia Rapp, a spokeswoman for Sicpa S.A., the leading maker of ink used in currencies, cited the case of two Wichita high school students who were charged with counterfeiting in 1988. The authorities said the two had printed about $15,000 in fake cash using a parent's photocopier.
"The color copier makes counterfeiting something that anybody can do with no expertise," Ms. Rapp said.
While currency makers already have an array of design tricks to foil the fakes, including special ink not available for use in copiers, even more are due soon.
Working with its suppliers, U.S. Banknote can offer paper made so that a distinctive thread of another material runs through each note. Some American currency has a polyester; some British pounds have a metal thread. Another anticopier device used in American bills is "microprinting," which creates a legend around the bill's portrait that is so small no copier can reproduce it distinctly.
Despite such safeguards, the dollar remains a favorite target, and a relatively easy one at that.
"U.S. currency is a single color, it's all the same size, there's no watermark," noted Mr. Kreitman.
 
Check It Out
Holograms, Inks Hold Promise
 A possible future security tactic may be to put a hologram on every bill, assuming the technologies are developed to allow printing a hologram directly onto paper. Mr. Kreitman said the flatness of a holographic image on a fake bill would be easy to spot.
Meanwhile, Sicpa, the ink producer, is offering currency printers a special ink that changes color depending on how light strikes it. Thus, a genuine bill will change color when moved, but the fake will not.
This "optically variable ink" is already used in currencies printed for Argentina, Israel, Kenya, Singapore, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates and Zaire, said Ms. Rapp.
"It's a way for the man on the street to check any bill," she said.
 
 
 
THE SWISS CONNECTION
 Around the world, probably fewer than a dozen companies literally make money. When they do, it is almost certainly with the inks supplied by a single privately held Swiss company, on presses made by another Swiss enterprise and with paper from a few specialized providers.
Crane & Company of Dalton, Mass., for example, gets about 30 percent of its revenue from supplying paper for currency, said James Manning, a company spokesman. That includes paper for the United States dollar, for which Crane has an exclusive contract.
The ink for more than 80 percent of the world's currency, including the dollar, comes from Sicpa S.A., based in Lausanne. (The name was originally an acronym for Societe Industrielle et Commerciale des Produits Amon, and the Amon family, which started it, still controls the company.)
Most of the world's currency, including the United States dollar, is produced by the intaglio method of printing, on presses made by De La Rue-Giori S.A., a privately held Swiss company of which De La Rue P.L.C. of London owns 50 percent.
In the intaglio method, letters and images are engraved onto a metal plate. The plate's surface is inked, then wiped clean, so that ink remains only in the etched lines. When the ink is taken up by a piece of paper, it "actually sits on the surface of the note, like a business card," said Carl Meyer, a spokesman for the Secret Service.
The method, more expensive than offset printing, requires special presses and is itself one of the oldest anti-counterfeiting techniques.
Currency paper "isn't made from ground-up trees," said Mr. Manning of Crane. "We use waste cuttings from the textile industry, old blue jeans, and so on. And about 25 years ago, in response to the higher amount of synthetic fibers going into clothes, we started going straight to the cotton plant for raw material."

It's Dim Days on the Bourse

BYLINE: By Roger Cohen

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Battered by high German interest rates, uncertainty over European monetary union and malaise stemming from the war in what was once Yugoslavia, the French stock exchange is in the doldrums. And few analysts expect any significant upswing before the end of the year.
After climbing steadily from the start of the year until May 11, when the 40-stock blue-chip CAC index stood at 2,077, or 17.6 percent above its Jan.1 level, the Bourse has slumped. It closed on Friday at 1,724.18, down 2.3 percent from Jan. 1. 
 Behind the decline lies the evaporation of the hopes that characterized the first few months of 1992. At that time, it was widely believed the United States would emerge more strongly from recession. It was also thought that the fiscal and inflationary pressures on the German economy stemming from unification would be resolved faster, allowing interest rates to come down and spurring a European economic recovery.
Instead, the United States economy has stalled and German (read European) interest rates have continued to go up. Because the currencies of European Community countries are tied within a narrow band by the European Monetary System, interest-rate policies throughout the bloc are effectively pegged to Germany's.
"With interest rates at around 10 percent, there is no immediate hope of an upturn on the Bourse," said Jean Borgeix of the Pinatton brokerage house. "I think we need to get rates down to 8 percent to relaunch investment and attract people back to the stock market."
In this sense, the situation in Europe -- where all stock exchanges have suffered in recent months -- is the opposite of that in the United States, where Wall Street's bull market has been supported by very low interest rates.
Few see any hope of imminent change. "I don't think German rates will budge much before next year," said Alain Ferri, president of the Ferri S.A. securities firm.
On top of this, the new uncertainty surrounding European monetary integration itself has hurt confidence. A French referendum on monetary union will be held Sept. 20, and opinion polls now suggest a close result. Denmark rejected the plan in a vote last June.
If France also rejects the program agreed upon under last year's Maastricht Treaty for the introduction of a single European currency by 1999, the plan will effectively be dead. So, too, will the rigorous budgetary and inflation standards set by the treaty to insure that European economies be sufficiently harmonized to allow a single currency.
The prospect of an abrupt reversal in Europe's 35-year-old process of integration is causing profound uneasiness, several brokers said.
But there is also widespread concern that France's image could suffer from a rejection of monetary union, and that an unraveling of the treaty would lead to pressure on weaker European currencies because the targets and budgetary discipline imposed at Maastricht would no longer apply.
"Investors are concerned that a no vote might put further upward pressure on interest rates because weaker currencies such as the lira would be under attack," said Marc Warnier of Patrice Warnier S.A., a securities firm.
He predicted that the Bourse would continue to decline at least until the Sept. 20 vote. Another school, however, argues that the collapse of the Maastricht Treaty might give individual European economies breathing space by enabling them to maneuver more independently of Germany's current deflationary policies.
"That could eventually lead to an upswing on the Bourse, because the French economy is fundamentally strong," said Mr. Borgeix of Pinatton.
Indeed, with inflation at 3.2 percent and a budget deficit equivalent to just 2 percent of gross national product, the French economy is widely viewed as the strongest in Europe and the best placed to lower interest rates.
The sharp improvement in the country's economic performance over the past four years, combined with the rapid modernization of the Bourse, have transformed the standing of an exchange once shunned by foreigners.
Jean-Francois Theodore, president of the Bourse, said foreign, and particularly United States investment now accounts for about one-third of trading volume. The total capitalization of the Bourse has grown rapidly, to $969 billion, from $603 billion in 1987. "We believe we now have one of the most transparent and highly computerized exchanges," Mr. Theodore said.
A further boost to the Bourse will probably be given by a law that goes into effect Sept. 14. Known as the Plan d'Epargne en Actions, or plan for savings in shares, the law has been widely advertised by banks. It will allow people to invest a maximum of 600,000 francs each, or $120,000, in shares on a tax-free basis, provided they hold the stocks for at least five years.
With the new law imminent, and a French vote in favor of European monetary union still the most likely result, some brokers think the time has come to invest.
Among the stocks widely cited as favorites are the food group BSN, the Michelin tire company, the Peugeot auto group and -- provided a reasonable settlement is reached in the pay dispute between the company and the contractors completing the channel tunnel -- the Eurotunnel group.

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
 
Let the People Pay the Debt 

Though he spoke for 53 minutes in accepting his party's renomination, President Bush had little to say about his accomplishments for the economy. The nation's woes, he said, were the fault of a Congress that failed to pass his economic plan and forced him into a one-time tax increase. Mr. Bush said he would cut taxes if re-elected and enforce a spending freeze on his own, through vetoes. He also outlined a novel approach to trimming the deficit: put a box on Federal tax forms that people could check if they wanted 10 percent of their payments to be used to reduce the deficit. The total would be deducted from spending. "I laughed when I heard it," said Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute. "It will do nothing but shuffle numbers. There are no specifics as to where the cuts will come from."
 
Pentagon Pinch on R.& D.
 
A week after a panel of the National Science Foundation chastised business and government for spending too little on research and development, the General Accounting Office said the Pentagon would reduce its outlays to Sematech, the semiconductor research consortium. Sematech has 12 corporate members as well as the Pentagon and has been credited by several companies with helping them regain strength in manufacturing. The Defense Department had been ponying up $100 million a year for the consortium, but wants to cut back to $80 million and spread it among several organizations. Why? Studies by market research firms like the Dataquest Corporation, of Cambridge, Mass., suggest America is winning back market share from Japan. Dataquest said America's share of the world's chip market was 36.5 percent last year, up from 34.9 percent in 1990.

A Housing Spurt That Wasn't
 
Among economists, the consensus view was that the housing market would pick up a little steam. After all, it is interest-rate sensitive and rates on mortgages are at 20-year lows. The consensus was wrong. The Commerce Department said housing starts fell in July by 2.8 percent, the second decline in a row. The reason for the tumble, analysts said, was flagging consumer confidence. "We've got a tug-of-war going between lower interest rates and the factors causing the lower interest rates," said David Seiders of the National Association of Home Builders.

Behind the Jobless Figures
 
At first glance, the sharp increase in jobless claims looked like grim news: the Labor Department said they reached 474,000 in early August, growing by 71,000, for their largest increase since the 1982 recession. But on closer examination, most of the new claims were the result of a two-week shutdown of Midwestern plants by the General Motors Corporation. Excluding G.M., the jobless claims were virtually unchanged.

Not What Lincoln Said
 
In his eloquent and witty speech to the Republican faithful -- "I knew Jefferson, he was a friend of mine" -- Ronald Reagan portrayed Lincoln in a new light: that of Lincoln the supply-sider. Mr. Reagan quoted Lincoln as saying: "You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves." Mr. Reagan lifted those quotations from "The Toastmaster's Treasure Chest," his secretary said. Trouble is, the words Mr. Reagan put in Lincoln's mouth were those of John Henry Boetcker, a minister and pamphleteer from Erie, Pa., born in 1873.

While high-level Republican honchos spoke in Houston about family values on what was billed as "Family Night," the band played music in between the speeches from the play "La Cage aux Folles." Though the play is about a loving, caring, long-term relationship, it is perhaps not exactly the type of relationship the Republicans had in mind.

Socking It Out in Baseball
 
Baseball -- the owners' game -- is as rough and tumble as anything that happens on the field. To get approval for selling the Giants for $110 million and moving the team to St. Petersburg, Fla., Bob Lurie, the team's owner, is switching positions and backing a group of owners who want to oust Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent from his job, according to baseball insiders. Dissident owners, led by Jerry Reinsdorf of the White Sox, are unhappy with Mr. Vincent's handling of labor relations, television and allocation of expansion money between the leagues. Mr. Lurie needs help from the dissidents to move the Giants since some American League owners don't want Florida to be an all-National League state.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Credit and Blame on Trade
 
America's worldwide trade deficit narrowed in June, but the key word is slightly. The Commerce Department said the deficit was $6.59 billion, while May's gap was revised downward to $7.14 billion. But while the Administration quickly took credit for June's 7.2 percent gain in exports, no one was eager to take credit for the 4.7 percent gain in imports.

Japan's Blindfold Strategy
 
Japan's solution to its stock market woes can be summed up by the maxim, "What you don't know can't hurt you." In an effort to instill a measure of confidence in the stock market and keep investors from selling, Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata said last week that, among other things, financial institutions would be permitted to withhold negative financial news from the public. Though he has no power to enforce it, Mr. Hata also told financial institutions not to sell stocks on which they can still record a profit until after the fiscal year ends Sept. 30. The strategy appears to be working. Though the stock market lost about 60 percent of its value in the last three years -- more than the American market lost in the three years after the 1929 crash -- it staged a comeback last week that was so strong it seemed as if the market was on steroids. The Nikkei climbed 12.8 after Mr. Hata's remarks and closed the week at 16,216.88.

The Honda Motor Company said net income for its first fiscal quarter fell 22.6 percent from a year ago to $131 million due to slack sales in Japan and North America.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
American's Price Turnaround
 
When American Airlines cut its prices and simplified its advance-purchase requirements in April, it sent the financially fragile airline industry into a tizzy. Other airlines said American was trying to drive them out of business. But American, the nation's No. 1 carrier, has taken its share of lumps too. Though it did not disclose an exact figure, the AMR Corporation, American's parent, said last week its third-quarter losses would be even higher than its $48 million operating loss in the second quarter. American earned $70.3 million in its third quarter last year. To stem those losses, American said it would raise fares 15 percent to 25 percent. "Perhaps this will shock the industry into some sensibility," said Julius Maldutis, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.

Bud's Expose on Coors
 
In the bruising beer wars, Anheuser-Busch Inc., which brews Bud Light, has a message for people whose taste in suds runs to Coors. In commercials running in New York and Pennsylvania, the folks at Bud said the "pure Rocky Mountain spring water" in Coors Light is sent by railroad tank car to a processing plant in Virginia where it is mixed with -- horrors -- "local water." To get Anheuser to stop its unflattering -- but true -- ads, the Adolph Coors Company took the folks at Bud to court. Last week, Federal District Judge Michael B. Mukasey ruled Coors could not stop Anheuser-Busch from "hoisting Coors by its own petard." Coors said it was considering an appeal.

Wang Crosses Chapter 11 Line
 
Wang Laboratories, the once high-flying high-tech company founded by An Wang, an Asian immigrant and inventor, landed in Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code after circling around it for three years. Wang, which owned the market for dedicated word processors, saw its market eaten up by more versatile PC's. Though it moved successfully into the minicomputer market, its PC's flopped and it never developed products for the more lucrative work station and networking markets. In its filing, Wang listed $1.3 billion in debt and $1 billion in assets. The filing was "absolutely crucial to our company's survival and the preservation of thousands of jobs," said Richard W. Miller, Wang's chairman. Wang is expected to lay off 5,000 workers in the coming months, leaving it with 8,000. In 1988, it had 31,500 employees.
 
Paying for Broken Heart Valves
 
About 450 replacement heart valves produced by Pfizer Inc.'s Shiley unit have failed. Linked to those failures are 300 deaths. Last week, a Federal District Court judge in Cincinnati approved the settlement of a class-action lawsuit affecting 51,000 people with Shiley replacement valves. In the settlement, Pfizer agreed to pay $500,000 to $2 million for each valve failure, which is expected to cost the company between $165 million and $215 million for the failures to date. Pfizer set aside $300 million for the claims in January. But the settlement could eventually cost the company "several hundred million dollars more," depending on how many more valves fail and have to be replaced, said the judge, S. Arthur Spiegel. Another suit seeking damages for mental anguish has been filed in state court in Orange County, Calif.

Chrysler Muscled the Money
 
After waiting anxiously for weeks, the Chrysler Corporation finally got its 152-member banking syndicate to approve a $6.8 billion line of credit. The new credit replaces loans of equal size to the Chrysler Financial Corporation that are used to finance car sales. But getting a "yes" on the credit line took muscle. Chrysler enlisted the support of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to talk up the company's good points with the banking syndicate's reluctant German members. The German banks were worried about Chrysler's $4 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. The credit rating agencies, which put Chrysler's debt solidly in the "junk" category, were pleased with the agreement. "We view the loan agreement positively because it removes a risk we were worried about," said Solomon Samson, managing director of the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

Investing in Flat Screens
 
Motorola Inc. said last week it would buy a 20 percent piece of In Focus Systems Inc., of Tualatin, Ore., for $22 million. In Focus is one of the few American companies making sophisticated flat-panel display screens.

HEADLINE: Networking;
A New Hub Lets More LAN's Join the Conversation

BYLINE: By STEPHEN C. MILLER

 BODY:
Making a company's disparate computer networks work together is not easy. In many large companies, there is a mainframe network surrounded by a proliferation of local area networks with a hodge-podge of operating systems and wiring schemes. Providing simultaneous translation at the Tower of Babel was a minor matter compared with getting a network with S.N.A. (System Network Architecture -- I.B.M.'s mainframe wiring scheme) to talk to one with Ethernet wiring to talk to one with Token Ring or, Noah forbid, to an Appletalk network.
The job is made somewhat simpler through microprocessor technology known as an intelligent hub, which translates the signals from one kind of network into ones understandable by another. Hubs connect LAN's so that users on a network with one wiring scheme can get data or use peripherals from one with another scheme. 
 Hubs are digital versions of the old PBX patch panel telephone rooms. Now, just as a telephone operator sitting at a computer terminal can reroute a phone extension to a new location with a few key strokes, hub technology can switch computer users to different networks.
One limitation to current hub design is that most can connect LAN's only with one other kind of wiring scheme. The Chipcom Corporation of Southborough, Mass., has developed a hub that lets an administrator mix and match a network with up to three wiring schemes. The hub is called the Online Concentrator. "Being able to route three different networks through the same hub gives a network manager greater control at a lower cost," said Mary Modahl, director of network strategy research for Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.
Another advantage of the Online Concentrator is that it is really two hubs in one, so that if one crashes, the second can handle the network traffic until the first unit is repaired. This is known as fault-tolerance.
The Online concentrator handles Ethernet, Token Ring and F.D.D.I. (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) networks. The biggest Online Concentrator sells for $4,250 and can support up to 128 users depending on the wiring scheme. The smallest (which is not fault tolerant) sells for $1,695 and can handle up to 40 users.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Glitter, but Little Gold, in Regionals

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
While most mutual fund managers scour the country, and often the world, for investment opportunities, a handful prefer stocks from their own backyard. For the most part, their loyalty hasn't paid off.
With a few exceptions, the $820 million group of regional equity funds, which invest chiefly in stocks of companies based in one area, have mediocre performance records, reflecting at least in part the booms and busts of regional American economies. 
 Yet fund sponsors, bursting with regional pride, keep the market for new offerings hopping. The two most recent entrants: the Atlanta Growth Fund and the Arkansas Equity Growth Fund. Next: the Home State Pennsylvania Growth Fund, which debuts in September.
Why the proliferation? "One answer is they are easy to market," said John Reken thaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, an investment newsletter in Chicago. They appeal to local patriotism and are relatively easy to explain to investors.
Then too, regional fund managers presumably have an edge over managers of national funds because they have a smaller area to oversee. They can frequently visit the companies whose shares they hold, establish relationships with management and be alert to changes. Because of the narrow focus of each fund, managers should be in the best position to discover up-and-coming companies taking root in their areas.
Notwithstanding the logic, however, regional funds as a group have had a lackluster record. "It's difficult to separate the stock-picking question from the regional question, but the bottom line is that the funds haven't been successful," Mr. Rekenthaler said.
Basically, the weakness in the funds is the flip side of their strength: When the local economy suffers, so do they. That's bad news for their local investors, whose jobs or financial situations already depend heavily on the health of the regional economy.
Among the regional flops is the Calvert Washington Area Growth Fund, which merged with Calvert-Ariel Appreciation last September after returning nothing at all for the five years ended Aug. 31, 1991. That month, Transamerica Sunbelt, which gained an annual average of 6.8 percent in the same period -- nearly four percentage points behind growth funds, on average -- merged with Transamerica Special Emerging Growth. On Oct. 1, Southeastern Growth changed its name to Mentor Growth and expanded its charter after returning 7.7 percent a year in the same five years. In 1990, the Growth Fund of California lacked enough sponsorship even to get off the ground.
Only two of the regional funds have 10-year records, and one is a dud: the Fund of the Southwest, which invests up to three-quarters of its assets in companies with significant business ties in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico and Arizona. It gained an annual average of 11.2 percent through June 30, 1992, lagging growth funds by about four-and-a-half percentage points.
In its defense, while the Fund of the Southwest languished with the oil-dependent economy of the region during the mid-1980's, a new manager, Sharon Stone, reconfigured it when she took over in late 1987.
She shifted from energy stocks into services, discount retail and consumer nondurables, including Wal-Mart Stores and Dillard Department Stores. The increased diversification removed some of the industry-specific risk, and created a decent five-year track record. The fund, sold with a 4.75 percent load, actually outperformed growth funds for the five years ended June 30, returning an annual average of 10 percent, compared with 8.2 percent.
The other granddaddy of the regionals is its shining star and accounts for more than half of the group's assets: the $500 million IAI Regional Fund, a no-load fund that concentrates its investments in seven states in the upper tier of the Midwest.
Its manager, Bing Carlin, buys a mix of small and large companies; over the years, "the fund has been a very reliable offering, maneuvering handily through a variety of market conditions thanks to good stock picking and well-timed moves to cash," Morningstar analysts say. The fund rose 19.2 percent annually in the decade ended June 30, compared with 15.6 percent for all growth funds.
Another regional fund worth looking at is the Composite Northwest 50, which returned 12.3 percent for the five years ended June 30, compared with the 8.2 percent for all growth funds. It is an index fund duplicating the Composite Northwest 50 Index, which was devised by the fund's sponsors and is made up of 50 companies that do business or are located in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington. The fund is partly sheltered from downturns in the regional economy because while companies like Nike, Microsoft and Boeing (all in the Composite index) depend on the Northwest region for labor, they don't for revenues. While the fund is skewed toward cyclical companies, it has some holdings in most industries.
Or cast an eye on ASO Outlook Regional Equity, a bank-sponsored fund with a 4.5 percent load that invests mainly in small to medium-sized companies in the deep South, including Alabama, Florida and Georgia.

HEADLINE: Technology;
A Way to Look Into the Heart and Detect the Killer Plaque

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

DATELINE: SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.

 BODY:
Physicians have long sought a window into the heart, some means to glimpse the progression of the fatty plaque in coronary arteries before it causes a heart attack. Scientists at Imatron Inc., a small medical technology company here, say they have developed a scanning device that can do just that.
Heart specialists who have used the device say it provides a reliable early indicator of coronary artery disease, or atherosclerosis, and can eliminate for some people the need for more painful, time-consuming and far more expensive tests like the angiogram. The need for such an indicator is compelling, they add, because for many of the 1.5 million people who have heart attacks in the United States annually, the first symptom is death. The situation is all the more tragic because if caught early enough, coronary artery disease can be slowed or reversed with diet changes or drugs. 
 Physicians have had no early indicator because existing tests were either inconclusive or too dangerous and expensive for use on patients with no symptoms. Imatron's device, known as the Ultrafast CT, identifies coronary artery disease by detecting and quantifying the presence of calcium in the arteries. Not related to dietary calcium, arterial calcification is a byproduct of the cholesterol-laden plaque of heart disease.
"I call it the mammogram of the heart," said Arthur S. Agatston, an associate professor at the University of Miami School of Medicine and director of the noninvasive cardiology lab at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami. Just as mammograms are now recommended for all women over 40 for early detection of breast cancer, "there's enough evidence now to recommend mass screening" with Ultrafast CT for coronary artery disease, he said.
Simple cholesterol tests are not a reliable indicator of who will get coronary artery disease because most people who have heart attacks have only average or slightly elevated cholesterol levels, Dr. Agatston said. And even among people with cholesterol levels as low as 180 (the average is 210), heart attacks are still the leading cause of death. Nevertheless, for many people, although not all, lowering cholesterol levels significantly does slow or stop the disease, he said.
"We have to look directly at the disease itself, at the coronary arteries, noninvasively, in a quiet, inexpensive way," Dr. Agatston said. "We have to image the coronaries and see the people who are developing atherosclerosis and treat them aggressively." He has scanned 2,500 patients, none of whom had symptoms, and found 500 with signs of coronary artery disease.
Ultrafast CT works on the same principle as a conventional CT (computed tomography) scan, but, as the name implies, much more rapidly. The speed is essential for recording clear images of the beating heart.
A conventional CT scan mechanically rotates an X-ray tube around a patient to obtain multiple images, or slices, that are then compiled by a computer. The fastest such devices take about a second to complete a scan. While they can be used to make images of other parts of the body, they are not effective for hearts because the heart is in constant motion and the CT images are therefore blurred.
Ultrafast CT places the patient inside a giant X-ray tube and uses a varying electromagnetic field to rotate the electron beam under and around the patient's body. Scans take 50 to 100 milliseconds -- 10 to 20 times faster than the convention CT. As a result they can freeze the moving heart, just as a fast shutter speed on a camera can freeze motion. The calcification can then be identified as a light area on the image, just as bone appears on an X-ray.
Imatron is publicly held, its stock traded over the counter, and had earnings of $1 million, or 1 cent a share, in 1991, on revenues of $18.9 million. Imatron's founders, a group of radiology specialists from the University of California at San Francisco, originally developed Ultrafast CT to record heart function, blood flow through the heart and defects in the heart muscle itself. Because calcium, like bone, blocks the passage of X-rays, and because there is a 100 percent correlation between coronary calcification and atherosclerosis, Ultrafast CT was a natural candidate for early detection of coronary artery disease.
"The nice thing about calcification is it's very easy to see on the Ultrafast CT, and physiologically, the only way you can get calcification is by coronary atherosclerosis," said David G. King, Imatron's director of clinical science and the developer of the coronary artery scan function. "That's why it's very good for screening -- the object is you don't want anybody walking away from the test who has disease undetected."
Mr. King, 44, was on the team at EMI Ltd. of England that developed the first CT scanner in 1973, and had a strong motive for being the first patient scanned by the Ultrafast CT four years ago -- a cholesterol reading of 330, far above the 200 considered normal. Yet a scan of his arteries showed no calcification, fueling his belief that many people are given costly cholesterol-lowering drugs when in fact they do not have atherosclerosis. Coronary artery scanning could reduce or eliminate this unnecessary medication, he said.
In addition to showing the presence of calcium, Ultrafast CT can compute the amount present by computing the square area occupied by the deposits. Follow-up scans can then show the progression of the disease, or the impact of drugs or diet on halting it. About 6 out of 10 asymptomatic patients have no calcium. For the remaining four, two typically have small amounts, and should have follow-up scans; two have advanced disease and should see a cardiologist for drugs or other therapy to lower cholesterol, according to Imatron.
The Ultrafast CT units sell for about $2 million, although most hospitals lease them. Most hospitals charge $350 to $400 to perform an Ultrafast scan. Imatron has sold 50 scanners worldwide, 14 of them last year. Some analysts say sales would be stronger but for the poor marketing skills of a company run by scientists. But some physicians blame the cardiology community itself for clinging to older tests, even though they may be more dangerous and expensive, in the case of angiography (a $1,500 test in which a dye is injected into the arteries and an X-ray is taken), or less conclusive, in the case of treadmill tests or simple cholesterol counts.
"Cardiologists are in love with angiography," said Bruce H. Brundage, chief of cardiology at Harbor U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Torrance, Calif., and the first physician to use Ultrafast CT to scan for coronary artery disease. "The hard facts of life out there are that there is still an economic incentive to do angiograms," he said. "Any relatively inexpensive test might be threatening to them."
AND even some supporters of Ultrafast CT say that Imatron has erred in promoting it so heavily as a screening device for coronary artery disease when it actually has many functions that would better justify its considerable cost. These include imaging the action of the heart muscle, defective valves, and even tumors within the heart itself.
Patrick F. Sheedy 2d, a professor of diagnostic radiology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said the company risks alienating heart specialists by promoting its scan over long-established procedures. "The wild-eyed enthusiast is not going to convince all the cardiologists in the country that this is what they ought to do," he said. Nevertheless, the Mayo Clinic has two Ultrafast CT's and has scanned several hundred patients.
Another question is, "once you find the presence of coronary calcium, what does it mean," said Dr. Brundage of Harbor U.C.L.A. Medical Center, which also has two Imatron devices. "How aggressive should we be once we identify it? It seems to me we should define risk relative to age." One comforting fact, for those whose tests are clean: "the absence of calcium virtually excludes coronary artery disease," Dr. Brundage said.
The reluctance of insurers to pay for costly screening tests like the Ultrafast for asymptomatic patients has contributed to the slow acceptance of Imatron's device. Yet that price could fall as low as $100 in sufficient volume, or about the same as a cholesterol test, which insurers do pay for.
Mr. King said he thinks that ultimately insurers will realize it is less costly to prevent disease than to treat it. "We are spending more and more dollars on people who are sick, people with advanced disease who have had heart attacks," he said. "Finding the disease earlier, preventing the coronary events, preventing people from going on drugs unnecessarily, will save money."

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Women Talk About What They Want

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
SOME time back, when my mother was in the market for her first new car, she called to say that she had been reading up on automobiles and she had been shopping around.
"I think I've found what I want," she said. "But the best thing about it is that the salesman is a woman." 
 We talked about the vehicle -- a Plymouth compact -- and we agreed that it was probably just right for her. "I'm glad," she said, "because I wouldn't buy it if you didn't approve. But I'll tell you something else. I also wouldn't buy it if I couldn't buy it from a woman."
At the time, my mother was 74 years old and not exactly a feminist. But her tour of the showrooms had demonstrated what so many women have learned: Car salesmen frequently treat them with condescension, no matter that they've done their homework.
More and more dealerships are addressing the problem, though, if not because of a social conscience then because it is simply good business. Female buyers now represent nearly half the market, and they influence much of the rest of it.
They also know their own minds, according to a couple of new studies, one by J. D. Power and Associates, the other conducted for Woman's Day magazine.
The Power Report, a newsletter published by the California consulting firm, notes in this month's issue that women were the principal drivers of 46 percent of the new cars registered for personal use between May of 1990 and April 1991. Of those, it says, small and sporty cars predominated.
Tom Healey, director of media and advertising for J. D. Power, said the company's data show that the Geo Storm and the Isuzu I-Mark were the models with the highest incidence of female drivers and that economy seemed to be the primary selling point. Next in popularity with women, he said, were the Nissan Pulsar, Volkswagen Cabriolet and Eagle Summit.
"There is some reflection in the data of how much women can or want to spend for new cars," Healey said. "It seems to me, though, that there is also an element of fun and style in the choices."
Safety, too, is high on the list, according to the Woman's Day survey in which 1,000 women across the country were contacted by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman, an independent polling company. While about a quarter cited operating costs as the most important selling point, 23 percent said they were looking for safety.
The most-wanted feature, cited by 86 percent of the respondents, was a driver's air bag. Passenger bags and antilock brakes tied at 84 percent, followed by traction control (82 percent), anti-theft systems (54 percent), four-wheel drive (44 percent) and keyless remote locks (37 percent).
The study conflicts somewhat with the data from J. D. Power in that the majority of the women said they drove domestic cars. Asked which they thought were better, nearly half said domestic, 32 percent said foreign and 21 percent were unsure.
The vote for "vehicle driven most often" went to sedans, with 52 percent. Hatchbacks and sports cars were predictably most popular with younger and single women, and women with children preferred vans over station wagons.
Also no surprise was the fact that men and women like different sorts of automobiles. Traditional muscle cars such as Chevrolet's Camaro and Ford's Mustang are bought mostly by males, according to the Power survey. Luxury models and high-priced sports cars also tend to have a masculine audience.
Most of the women responding to the poll by Woman's Day said the thing they liked best about their cars was the handling. To nearly half, the car was an expression of their personalities, and 70 percent said the vehicles gave them a sense of independence.
On the negative side, cost of operation was the biggest complaint, but the women also said they were not averse to doing some maintenance jobs themselves. Most said they did not mind filling the gas tank or checking the oil.
Surprisingly in this era of maintenance-free cars, 40 percent also said they would be comfortable jump-starting the engine, and 28 percent said they would change their own flat tire.
Jane Chesnutt, the magazine's editor, said she thinks one of the more interesting aspects of the study also was women's influence in the purchase of family cars.
"Sixty-five percent share the decision equally with their husbands when buying themselves a car, and 22 percent say they're the primary decision maker," she said. "Forty-five percent say they play an equal part in the decision to buy their husbands' cars."
They also say, almost to a woman, that they have veto power over cars that fail to move them.
And, like my mother, nearly two-thirds said salesmen treated them worse than they treated men. Specifically, the women said, the tactics that bothered them most were pushiness and being treated "like an invisible person."
Some of the dealers, it seems, have yet to see the light.

HEADLINE: Pro-Choice Means Women Can Make Decisions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While I respect Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and appreciated his pro-America, pro-change, pro-choice address at the Democratic National Convention, I must take issue with his "Reducing Casualties in the Abortion Battle" (Op-Ed, Aug. 5). 
 As an abortion rights activist, I realize the need to find a common ground between the opposing sides. However, a pro-choice stand encompasses not only the abortion issue; pro-choice is pro-individual freedom. The Governor attempts to include the pro-life ideology to the extent that he misrepresents the pro-choice side, which he publicly advocates.
His emphasis on abstinence, "the path of restraint," is insulting to women and men. Governor Cuomo seems to argue that the only purpose of sex should be reproduction. The decision to have sex for reproduction or for pleasure and intimacy must be made by two consenting, protected individuals; it should not be legislated by government.
With the freedom of self-determination that this country grants comes responsibility. Because unprotected sex can affect more than the individual by passing a disease or bringing a child into the world, we must advocate birth control and safe sex, as Mr. Cuomo states, but ultimately it is up to the individual. Our schools have the responsibility to educate about contraception, as he says. But a problem lies in trying to unite the pro-choice and the pro-life sides because many people who oppose abortion rights also oppose contraception.
Mr. Cuomo's examination of adoption seems also to pander to the pro-life faction. Yes, adoption is an option for women who have white, healthy babies. Minority and handicapped babies often sit in orphanages for years.
I wholeheartedly applaud his suggestion, which follows the New York State model, to aid women financially who decide to bring a child to term, especially as the pro-life movement seems to see life as starting at conception and ending at birth. They force women to have babies and then oppose programs to help impoverished women raise these children.
However, Mr. Cuomo writes of abortion for those women who "consider abortion because of economic extremity," meaning abortion is only acceptable in certain financial situations. What of teen-agers or single parents who do not feel ready to give a child what it needs emotionally?
Governor Cuomo makes a judgment about when it is permissible for a woman to have an abortion. Abortion rights activists fight to keep abortion an option for all women. The pro-choice stand, unlike the pro-life stand, acknowledges women as intelligent, rational beings who can make this very serious and personal decision for themselves without government intervention.
The movement needs Governor Cuomo, a strong pro-choice advocate with acuteness and political power. However, it is vital to acknowledge that pro-choice extends to individual freedom because, without that, this country is not a democracy. This right goes hand in hand with responsibility. However, it is not as easy as Mr. Cuomo suggests to unite both sides of the debate, because the right to choose abortion is not an isolated issue.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Divided Government: Messy, but Not Fatal

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN accepting renomination last week, President Bush sounded one of the fundamental themes of his re-election campaign. He assailed Congress for its failure to approve many of his proposals on education, health care, crime and taxes.
Mr. Bush is sure to hammer that theme again and again in the next 10 weeks, in the hope that voters will blame Congress rather than him for the stagnation of the economy and other domestic problems. Mr. Bush's indictment of Congress reflects the conventional wisdom in Washington, which holds that Government is inevitably paralyzed when one party controls the White House and the other controls Congress. 
 But is that so? In a recent book, "Divided We Govern" (Yale University Press, 1991), Prof. David R. Mayhew, a political scientist at Yale, challenges the conventional wisdom. He studied 267 major laws enacted from 1947 through 1990 and concluded that divided partisan control of Congress and the White House makes "very little difference" in the output of legislation.
"From the Taft-Hartley Act and Marshall Plan of 1947-48 through the Clean Air Act and $490 billion deficit-reduction package of 1990, important laws have materialized at a rate largely unrelated to conditions of party control," Mr. Mayhew says in his book.
His finding suggests that governments with a Republican President and a Democratic Congress, seen as the norm in recent years, may not be cause for so much consternation as many people believe. Conversely, it suggests that Gov. Bill Clinton might not have clear sailing with Congress if he wins the Presidential election.
Words like "deadlock" and "stalemate" are often used to describe the situation on Capitol Hill. Mr. Bush continually rails against "the gridlocked Democratic Congress," as he did in his acceptance speech. Congress, he says, has become a "master of inaction," and he invites voters to "join me in rolling away the roadblock at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue." But Mr. Bush has done less than some of his predecessors to roll away that roadblock.
 
The Great Persuaders
 Professor Mayhew found that strong Presidential leadership and strong commitment to solving national problems could create broad bipartisan majorities for the passage of major bills even in times of divided government.
He cites these examples: the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, the Landrum-Griffin Labor Reform Act of 1959, the Tax Reform Act of 1969, the Clean Air Act of 1970, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the New York City bailout in 1975 and the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.
President Richard M. Nixon extracted large amounts of legislation from a Democratic Congress. If Mr. Bush needs a more recent model for such collaboration, he can look to Ronald Reagan, who blustered, wheedled and manipulated Congress until it passed many of his proposals.
Most notably in 1981, Mr. Reagan persuaded a Democratic House to pass the biggest tax cut in American history and a separate bill that trimmed spending in myriad programs, including welfare, food stamps, Social Security, education, housing and farm subsidies.
Mr. Reagan had a powerful, coherent vision of smaller Government, and he pursued it doggedly. He sensed shifts in national mood and exploited them to advance his budget-cutting, tax-cutting program.
By contrast, Mr. Bush's domestic proposals seemed to have no unifying theme and often read like a laundry list. He has not shown the will to ram legislation through Congress, and he has not given Congress a clear sense of his own priorities. Neither he nor his lieutenants have shown much appetite for a sustained engagement with Congress on the complex details of health-care, budget and tax legislation.
 
Budget Rejected
 When Mr. Bush's budget was laid before the House of Representatives in March of this year, it was rejected by a vote of 370 to 42. Republicans voted against it by a margin of nearly 3 to 1. Representative C. W. Bill Young, Republican of Florida, voted for it, but said he disliked the proposal to increase Medicare premiums for elderly people with incomes over $100,000 for an individual or $125,000 for a couple.
Mr. Bush did little to whip up Congressional support for his budget. The idea of tying Federal payments to family income was a cornerstone of his effort to restrain the growth of benefit programs, which account for half of all Federal spending.
Mr. Mayhew's study suggests that Gov. Bill Clinton may be raising unrealistic expectations if he thinks he can work miracles with a Democratic Congress. President Jimmy Carter had more than a few problems with Democratic power barons on Capitol Hill. "To suppose that an American party winning Congress and the Presidency thereby wins the leeway of a British parliamentary party is to be deluded by the election returns," Professor Mayhew says in his book.
James L. Sundquist, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution, a research center in Washington, says that for much of the period from 1947 to 1990, the Democratic Party was itself deeply divided, and conservative Democrats often collaborated with Republicans.
But many of those conservative Democratic Southern lawmakers have been replaced by moderate Democrats more aligned with the outlook of the national party. So Mr. Clinton, if elected, might have an easier time dealing with Congress than Mr. Carter did. "If Democrats again have an opportunity to run a unified Government," said Mr. Sundquist, "it will be more cohesive and ideologically homogeneous." Of course Mr. Bush argues that electing a Republican President and a Republican Congress would also produce a more cohesive, harmonious and productive government.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Crazy for Country Music

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
TWO guys are running for President.
One lost his father before he was born, was raised by an alcoholic, abusive stepfather, and has a gambling mother who has been married five times, to four men. He's had to own up to some of the most publicized marital troubles of modern times, and has a brother who he helped land hard time for a coke rap. 
 The other was the pride of Greenwich Country Day School, where he arrived each morning in a chauffeured sedan. At Yale, he was tapped by Skull and Bones, America's most exclusive secret society. His mother was a tennis champion and he spends as much time as he can each year at the family compound in Maine.
Which life sounds like a country music song?
"I'm pretty certain there has never been a presidential candidate that seems to spring more clearly from the world of country music than Bill Clinton," said John Morthland, author of the standard 1984 reference book, "The Best of Country Music."
"It's always been about working class people from the Bible Belt," he said. "Democrats mostly, rowdy people who stray and regret it. Unlike what you saw in Houston, the music has always supported a huge diversity of values."
But it is the unrowdy Mr. Bush who subscribes to Country Music magazine, while Mr. Clinton pledges his allegiance to Elvis. (Like the Holy City of Jerusalem -- a touchstone for three of the world's major religions -- the King is considered sacred by fans of both rock and country.)
Over the past four years the President has made much of his love of country music. The devotion is genuine, but it is one that also seeks to remind those disaffected, hard-scrabble Reagan Democrats that their true compatriot in this election from Houston, not from Hope.
 
D-I-V-O-R-C-E
 Nothing could have made that case more forcefully than when Hillary Clinton asserted her identity earlier this year by taking a swipe at "Stand By Your Man," Tammy Wynette's anthem to the long-suffering wife. At the time, nobody mentioned another hit by Ms. Wynette: "D-I-V-O-R-C-E," nor has anybody in the Republican Party lately been heard humming the Johnny Cash classic, "A Boy Named Sue."
Drawing political values from music can be a tricky business, as the Republicans should have noticed by now. Country music in particular has never sold better to the suburban voters whom both parties lust after.
But for every song that evokes nostalgic images of religion, patriotism and plucky independence, there are at least three that go the other way, sounding themes of adultery (George Strait's "All My Ex's Live in Texas" comes to mind), booze and wanton dissolution. Temptation -- whether it's the lure of the bottle (as in George Jones's "If Drinkin' Don't Kill Me, Her Memory Will"), of the road (Roger Miller's "King of the Road"), or of another woman (David Allan Coe's "Now I Lay Me Down to Cheat") -- runs like a ruby red weave through country music.
Just check out the lineup at the convention. Wynonna Judd, one of the Republican's most cherished sweethearts, performed. But so did Tanya Tucker, the 33-year-old one-woman showcase for vocal purity and sexual liberty. Ms. Tucker, who once bragged that she has had more boyfriends than some people have had hot meals and who is an unwed mother of two, is no Murphy Brown. The last time Ms. Tucker appeared at a Republican convention, in 1980, she sang a duet with her beau at the time, Glen Campbell. She was 21, he was 44.
 
Stand by Your Music
 Lee Greenwood introduced Barbara Bush on the night she had staked out to honor traditional families. Mr. Greenwood is from the most commercial strain of country -- a music by and about white people -- and he's as proud of that as he is of America. Just now he is on his fifth wife, who, like Ms. Tucker, has two children born out of wedlock.
"Do these people ever actually listen to our songs?" said Rodney Crowell, a country music veteran whose newest album, "Life is Messy," pretty much sums up the dimestore philosophy of many of his musical colleagues. "George Bush came down to the Country Music Awards show earlier this year. Has this American art form fallen so low in self-esteem that we would just turn our award ceremony into a campaign event for a guy who doesn't even talk about any of our problems?"
Country musicians often address themes the Democrats hope to win with -- the economy, education and jobs. Buck Owen's 1966 hit, for example, "Waiting in Your Welfare Line," is a song ostensibly about a man seeking a handout of love. But they apply their true ardor to songs about God and Mama.
As always, God played a big role at the Republican convention, appearing in almost every speech. But perhaps it was Kitty Wells, the first queen of modern country music, who presented the strongest vision of the Lord's sense of life among the earthy in her signature song, "It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels."
Many people have noted that the real Southerners in the race, Mr. Clinton and, of course, Albert Gore of Tennessee pretty much steer clear of country music.
Perhaps because they don't want to rub the country's face in the fact that they both come from the South, it seems unlikely that they're going to want to spend much time fronting a fiddle band.
But this year the Democrats may be taking an even greater musical risk than the Republicans by favoring rock 'n' roll. Mr. Clinton wanted James Brown's "I Feel Good" as a theme song until an alert aide reminded him that Mr. Brown had just gotten out of prison for aggravated assault and carrying a shotgun. After his staff bought what seemed like half the compact disks in America, he settled for a convention finale of "Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow" by Fleetwood Mac, a group that has had at least its fair share of problems with traditional family values.

Japan Gives Banks a Break To Save the Market As a Recession Threatens

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Japan's Minister of Finance put his finger in the dike last week, announcing measures to discourage banks from dumping shares into the cratering stock market. The move was cheered as a step away from financial panic. But far more is needed to contain the flood.
Like their American counterparts, Japanese banks are sitting on humongous losses in commercial real estate. And to raise money for dividends, they have been tempted to sell securities bought for a song before the market peaked in 1989. 
 But with stocks already down by three-fifths -- some $3 trillion -- and the economy sputtering toward recession, the Government is eager to halt the vicious cycle in which the banks' rush to liquidity tightens the noose on businesses already lacking cash. Under the new rules, banks are allowed to pay dividends without showing profits. And as long as they hang onto stocks that have fallen in value, they can avoid revealing the losses on their balance sheets.
This is a palliative, everyone agrees, not a cure for what ails the over-extended Japanese financial system. Indeed, it smacks of the desperate efforts in the mid-1980's to postpone the day of reckoning for America's savings and loans.
What could make a real difference, though, is a stiff dose of public spending that generates jobs and profits. Just such a $25 billion to $50 billion package was promised at the Munich economic summit in July and is expected to be proposed formally within weeks.

HEADLINE: IDENTITY CRISIS;
Being Whatever It Takes to Win Election

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT'S going to be a crowded autumn.
There are, as far as can be seen through the fog, four serious candidates for the Presidency. On the Democratic side, there is Bill Clinton, the big-government, tax-crazy, special-interests-loving, old-fashioned liberal; and Bill Clinton, the covenant-building, moderate-minded, stand-up-to-the-interest-groups New Democrat. The Republicans have put forward George Bush, the vacillating, pawn-of-the-rich, inside Washington, country-clubbing middle-of-the-roader who wants everything to stay just the way it is; and George Bush, the arch-conservative, deeply religious, tax-cutting, Washington-bashing architect of bold new change. 
 This embarrassment of candidates was nearly inevitable. Men who want to be President, and the men and women whose job it is to get them there, are, despite their predilection for the language of idealism, strictly in the realism business. They do, as Mr. Bush has famously noted, whatever it takes. And what it takes, it has become increasingly clear, is a campaign of relentless, comprehensive distortion.
As the Republicans convened in Houston last week, the NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw offered an observation on the way journalists have come to cover political campaigns:
"The news cycle has become a 24-hour-a-day thing, and it moves very fast all the time now. What happens is that a fragment of information, true or false, gets sucked into the cycle early in the morning, and once it gets into the cycle it gets whipped around to the point that it has gravitas by the end of the day. And, unfortunately, people are so busy chasing that fragment of information that they treat it as a fact, forgetting about whether it is true or not."
The professionals of politics know that Mr. Brokaw is correct, and bank on it. In a time of information overwhelm, with the electoral process uncontrolled by party discipline and with the fates of candidates almost utterly dependent on the whims of passing public perception, they understand that the essential daily achievement of the candidate is to do himself right, and his opponent wrong, by that day's flow of pictures and words.
The flow is so fast, and so endless, that it is impossible for most voters (and for most journalists) to examine its contents except by occasional, shallow dips in the edge of the stream. The result is the campaign of 1992, which, although it still has months to go, has already reached new levels of manipulation of truth. On both the Republican and Democratic sides, the candidates and their campaign staffs are relentless in their efforts to idealize themselves and to demonize each other.
Indeed, this dual task was the only important goal of both the Democratic nominating convention held in New York last month and the Republican gathering in Houston. In both cases, the goal was achieved superbly.
Thus, Mr. Clinton, in the course of his party's nominating convention, and in the weeks since, has drawn a picture of himself as the exemplar of a new breed of Democrats that knows how to say no to constituency groups, is tough on defense, serious about cutting government spending and opposed to radical notions of any sort. There is evident truth in this portrait; the Arkansas Governor is a charter member of the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist group dedicated to these propositions, and his record as governor shows that he consistently has favored the centrist, compromise approach.
In the 1992 campaign, Mr. Clinton has advocated reforming the welfare system to oblige able recipients to work and establishing boot camps that would offer "harsh punishment" to juvenile criminals.
While he has supported legal abortion, he has suggested that states should have the right to impose some limits on abortions, and has argued that the government should do what it can "to make it as rare as possible."
He has angered some black political leaders with his (rather gentle) admonitions to black audiences on the necessity for self-discipline and a sense of responsibility.
But in the crucial matters of his economic plan and his party platform, said a leading policy expert of the left who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to represent the view of any party faction, Mr. Clinton has "put forward the most progressive agenda since 1972, put forward under a smoke screen that this was the most moderate Democratic convention and the most moderate Democratic platform ever."
Mr. Clinton has promised to re-distribute wealth by raising taxes on the rich, to double the rate of cutting the military budget, to invest huge sums in creating jobs by building roads and bridges, to hugely increase education spending, to fully fund Head Start, to provide national health care for everyone and paid for in part by new taxes and to give poor families tax credits.
Several consultants on Democratic policy called it the most progressive redistribution-of-wealth plan since the campaign of George S. McGovern.
Similarly, Mr. Clinton's campaign has in recent weeks put forward an image of his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, as a cookie-baking, home-making old-fashioned candidate's spouse, preferring to ignore her long and substantive career as a lawyer, liberal legal philosopher and advocate of profound change in the legal status and rights of children.
Building on these aspects of Mr. Clinton's views and life, Mr. Bush and his operatives will spend the next several months, as they have spent the past several days, working to create an opponent of nightmarish proportions -- a sort of Bill Dukakis-Carter-McGovern-Clinton.
A classic and important example can be found in the Republicans' charge -- employed by many during the convention week, including Mr. Bush himself -- that Mr. Clinton had raised taxes and fees 128 times in his home state of Arkansas.
As the columnist Michael Kinsley detailed in a recent report, the figure of 128 is false, based on trickery like counting taxes more than once, counting components of certain taxes as separate taxes in themselves, and including a number of minor fee increases that are a routine and inevitable feature of all governments. The accounting also fails to mention tax cuts enacted during Mr. Clinton's tenure as governor, or to note that Arkansas, a poor state, ranks 47th among the states in terms of the taxes it imposes as a share of personal income.
Mr. Bush's attempts to rework his self-portrait have been far more ambitious and more elaborate than Mr. Clinton's; their scope is breathtaking at times.
A President whose primary interest has been foreign affairs, Mr. Bush now depicts himself as a visionary of domestic change frustrated by a Democratic-controlled Congress. The son of a United States Senator, a child of wealth and privilege, the product of Andover, Yale and Greenwich, Conn., he styles himself as a man of down-home Texas country. A career public official who has spent most of his adult life in appointive or elected office in Washington, he now runs -- and rails -- against the bureaucrats and politicians of the Federal city.
An instinctive moderate who earned the enmity of religious and values-oriented conservatives in his first term, he now runs on a 'family values" agenda that the supporters of conservatives like Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson regard as their own. The signatory of a tax increase that broke the defining promise of his 1988 Presidential candidacy, he now places the blame for that increase entirely on Congress, and promises a new tax cut if re-elected.
 
The Bush Bogeyman
 With ammunition like that, Mr. Clinton finds it a simple matter to mold from the stuff of Mr. Bush's record and life a counterpart to the Republican Clinton-bogey, a George Hoover-McCarthy-Goldwater-Bush. The Bush-bogeyman, to hear Mr. Clinton tell it, is an irresponsible do-nothing President who is solely to blame for all that is wrong with the country, and gets no credit for anything that is right. The America Mr. Clinton conjures of the Reagan-Bush years seems a country of such dark, dismal misery as to be at times unrecognizable to one who lived in it.
It is a political given that both candidates will continue on this course; it has worked too well for them not to. Mr. Clinton's convention, with its days of praise for himself and its days of denigration of Mr. Bush, took him from well behind in the polls to far ahead. Mr. Bush's convention, which exceeded even Mr. Clinton in both puffery and calumny, seems to have brought him back on par with his rival.
Neither the mythical candidates of self-creation nor the bogeymen of the other side will be real, but reality-based. And, in the age of the docu-drama, that will be good enough for one of them to win.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Seeing Foreign Policy In a Rear-View Mirror

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
THE striking thing about the discussion of foreign policy so far in this election season is the gap between the weighty issues at stake and the content of the debate. It would be hard to recall a campaign in which so little has been said about so much by so many.
True, at last month's Democratic convention in New York, where Gov. Bill Clinton devoted 141 words to foreign policy in his acceptance speech, Democrats debated foreign policy in the halls. But it was not the traditional arguments between realists and idealists, interventionists and isolationists. The debate almost seemed to be between people who believe that the country should have a foreign policy and people who believe that it should not -- that after the cold war, the focus had to be at home because domestic issues were so pressing. At the Republican convention last week foreign policy figured in almost every speech, but not because there was any serious discussion of the issues. 
 Instead, foreign policy has been turned into the Bush campaign's all-purpose cleanser. It is being used to wipe away or excuse shortcomings of the Bush Presidency.
For instance, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said Mr. Bush had broken his no-new-taxes pledge mainly because he needed Congressional backing for the Persian Gulf War and because the President had a lot of distractions on his mind, including Iraqi "threats to poison the Bethesda, Md., water supply" or to rain missiles on the United States. Mr. Brady said this in all seriousness.
Speaker after speaker at the Astrodome said in effect that George Bush might not have had much of a domestic policy, but that was because he was totally preoccupied with winning the cold war. No one mentioned, however, that Franklin D. Roosevelt had managed simultaneously to promulgate and manage the New Deal while ushering the nation into World War II.
 
Justified in Churchillian Terms
 Even the shift of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to the White House, a desperate political move aimed at rescuing the Bush campaign, was justified in Churchillian terms more appropriate for the Council on Foreign Relations than for a smoke-filled room. In a world where power abroad increasingly depends on economic strength at home, Mr. Bush said, it is crucial to merge foreign and domestic policy in the White House. Why the President just happened to realize this in the heat of the campaign was left unsaid.
In a way, Mr. Bush's own campaign theme -- we saved the world in the first four years, now we will save America in the next four -- has unintentionally nurtured the impression that foreign policy is like a diet you can turn on and off. But foreign policy cannot be put on hold. Indeed, the next President will have to be able to walk and chew gum as never before.
In the wake of the cold war, the United States is entering a period of zero-based foreign policy. All issues -- from whether or not to maintain troops abroad to whether or not to bother solving regional problems like the Middle East -- are up for grabs.
Yet, to the extent that there has been a foreign policy debate in this campaign, it has been entirely backward looking, with Mr. Bush using his successes abroad to excuse shortcomings at home and Mr. Clinton focusing his critique on Mr. Bush's coddling of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq before the gulf war, while trying to ignore Mr. Bush's successful handling of the war itself.
But one wonders whether four years from now this campaign will be looked back on for the paucity of serious discussion about issues as elemental as how to meet the challenge of Japan, or respond to the ethnic violence in Europe.
"One reason for campaigns is to enable the candidate to build a mandate to govern," the foreign policy historian Michael Beschloss said. "When you have a campaign that is a silly season on foreign affairs, the result is that the President has to build a mandate from scratch after he takes office -- without really knowing what support is out there."
The disconnectedness of the current foreign policy debate is underscored by the fact that within the last week the Administration has initiated a dramatic shift of policy toward Iraq. It is a shift that could very easily lead to the disintegration of Iraq, and no one has told the American people, let alone debated it.
Britain, Saudi Arabia and France have agreed in principle to an American proposal to shoot down any Iraqi fighter planes that try to attack the rebellious Shiite Muslims who live below the 32d parallel.
President Hussein has been engaged in a brutal repression of the region's Shiite Muslims, who would like to carve out their own state. Since the end of the gulf war in March 1991, the United States has chosen not to intervene there, arguing that intervention could lead to a breakup of Iraq and that would upset the fragile balance of power in that corner of the world.
 
Why Iraq but Not Bosnia?
 But now Washington and its allies have reversed course and decided that they are ready to risk a disintegration of Iraq to expel Mr. Hussein. Yet no one has really explained this to the public, or explained why Washington would shoot down Iraqi planes that kill Shiites but not Serbian planes that kill Bosnians.
In part, this is because President Bush has long had an aversion to discussing his foreign policy moves in public. His policy has always been like a well-acted silent movie for an audience that enjoys singing along. But it is also because Mr. Clinton has been loath to challenge him on current Iraq policy for fear of looking soft or unpatriotic, and for fear of shifting the debate from at home to abroad, which plays to Mr. Bush's strength.
Moreover, Mr. Clinton does not seem to have made up his own mind on future foreign policy. He is not ready to posit a Wilsonian or Carteresque morally based foreign policy to contrast with Mr. Bush's pragmatic, interest-based handling of the issue. Mr. Clinton has tried to mix moralism with muscle, selectively accusing President Bush of being overly cynical in coddling tyrants from Baghdad to Beijing, but not suggesting that he would be excessively moralistic. This middle-of-the-roadism is not exactly great timber for a fiery debate.
And over and above all this, the poverty of real foreign policy debate can be explained by something very simple: that a bipartisan intuition is now taking hold among Republicans and Democrats.
It is an intuition that the post-cold war world is a tangled mess, where every situation is painted in shades of gray and where there will be no easy victories to be plucked. The reason both parties have focused their debate backwards is because that is the only direction in which they can see clearly any more.

HEADLINE: Women Get Into Political Football -- as the Ball

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
STANDING before a prime-time crowd that screamed their names in adulation, Barbara Bush and Marilyn Quayle led the Republican Party into a frenzy of family values on Wednesday night, taking turns before an audience of 23 million. Signs bearing their names appeared among the faithful. "Barbara for President" was one popular, if less than serious sentiment. And cries of "Ma-ree-lyn" resounded just as loudly as any cheer ever sent up in the Houston Astrodome.
It was a galvanizing moment, the work of pros. 
 So was the script that preceded. In back-to-back interviews leading up to Family Night, Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Quayle protested repeatedly that they were well-meaning but of no real account. Both said they had not bothered to read the party platform and allowed that they were just amazed to be flung up to the political front lines. Barbara Bush warned of an "overrated" speech by an "overrated" speaker. Mrs. Quayle dismissed her contribution as nothing more than "a teeny weeny little talk."
These affecting moments, too, were the work of pros.
At a time of social change, when the stay-at-home images of women are being constantly challenged and reworked, the Republicans last week effectively mixed old "aw shucks" rhetoric with the fact that this cyclone-prone political season has swept women center stage. There are, of course, some hardball politics at work here. Seven million more women than men voted in the last three Presidential elections. Both sides need those votes. Yet, however complicated the living and working arrangements of 1992 may be, simple messages still sell best. So the Republicans brought out an old one: Women, God bless them, are happier at home. And those who aren't can hurt you.
The role of the politicians' wives, so inconsequential in most years, has become a core question. And with no fallback formula, the political solution has become to give voters a little bit of everything.
Republicans have sculpted an array of messages combining competence with a total lack of threat. Mrs. Quayle befuddled a whole generation of women when she said "Most women do not wish to be liberated from their essential natures" -- without explaining whether the receptionist who works for minimum wage because she must has abandoned some profound part of her being. By contrast, Barbara Bush, reputed to be a scrapper in private, bounds about with a self-deprecating grandma demeanor in public. The Democrats, lacking that convincing retro-mom and retro-granny combo, have to face the tougher issues head on. After hailing Hillary Clinton as a model new woman able to balance a family and a thriving law practice, Democrats retreated in the face of stinging criticism and rewrote the script for their leading lady. By early summer, Mrs. Clinton's image had metamorphosed from that of mother, lawyer and outspoken champion of the Children's Defense Fund to a presumably kinder, quieter wife and mother who beams incessantly at her man. The make-over helped quell alarm that she would crash the White House as Mr. Clinton's equal. But the attacks are still coming.
Thus, during the Democratic convention, there was no Hillary Clinton center stage to do anything but clap, smile and do a little dancing. Instead, the Democrats addressed the gender gap by trotting out their female candidates and setting them up in a grand tableau that stretched the length of the Madison Square Garden stage. They also indulged in a fair amount of talk about "skirt-tails," giving a nod to the fact that Bill Clinton could use a boost from Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, the popular Senatorial candidates from California -- not the other way around.
The Republicans never really had that option. Any showcase of their women candidates would have undoubtedly risked awkward reminders of the bitter abortion debate. So they shifted course. "There has been a basic strategy this year by the Democrats saying that it is the 'Year of the Women,' " said Ian Weinschel, a political consultant who helped shape Patrick Buchanan's candidacy. Not wanting to be outdone, the Republicans figured out how to show off one of their prime political assets, Barbara Bush, while also sounding the horn for their favorite family values theme. "From a pure strategy standpoint," said Mr. Weinschel, "it made a lot of sense to put Barbara on."
The result is that Americans are now faced with cardboard cutouts that match political agendas more than real life. "People don't really know what to do with women in power," said Barrie Thorne, the head of the women's studies department at the University of Southern California. "Nancy Reagan was the 'vanity queen' to Barbara Bush's 'Queen Mum.' But these are all like plots of novels."
Low-income women who feel demonized by the Republican attacks on their absence from home, yet unfulfilled by low-paid and low-skilled jobs, often simply can't relate. The First Four Ladies, said Sandy Pope, a former executive director of the Coalition of Labor Union Women, "are financially able to make a whole array of choices that most of us aren't. We are debating about whether somebody should have given up their law practice, or whether someone has a 'real' family because they only had one child. But what is the real message? That these men's wives can stay home with the babies if George Bush goes back to the White House? Fine. But where's the economic program to make that possible?"
There are downsides for both sides. "For the Republicans to have a grandmotherly wife as the symbol of womanhood is a little out of step," said Ruth B. Mandel, director of the Rutgers Center for the American Woman and Politics. "It's a nostalgic image and therefore may seem safer for prime time. But to me it's a sign of total desperation."
Hillary Clinton's image as a softened-up professional has left some voters cold as well. Some working women resent the obvious repackaging as a stab at their own lives. "What is wrong with someone who is a dedicated mother and also works?" said Barbara D. Boehm, a wife, mother and associate curator at New York's Metropolitan Museum.
She believes the women are merely being used to deflect attention from issues like abortion and the economy. She is angry at the prospect of a political catfight. "The idea of pitting women against women is really very disturbing," she said. "I'm particularly troubled that they are going to try and set up a 'good mom' versus 'bad mom' fight."
Christine LaFia, a sociologist at Berkeley, dreads what she sees as a Republican design to "make Hillary appear as the dragon lady and Barbara the nurturing savior of the whole female species."
The day after the Republican convention, the polls showed George Bush and Bill Clinton running nearly neck and neck. Even though many voters may resist intellectually the spectacle of women having at each other, perhaps on some subliminal level the tactic has already proved effective. Whether it will work over the long haul probably will not be known until November. By then the smear campaigns and manipulations by political staffs may have backfired. Elaine La Roche, a Wall Street investment banker and a founder of a Republican group formed to help women candidates, said she objects to the blatant attempts to sculpt the images of the candidates' wives. "I don't know that I am going to see Hillary's name on the ballot," she said. "And I find it curious that we have come to this in 1992."
It may have been easier for everyone when "the wives" were merely a matter of hats, hemlines and hairdos. But unless women do return to home and hearth, it's unlikely that voters will soon be spared a replay of this year's family feuds. It was no coincidence that Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Quayle gave endless interviews in Houston any more than it has been a fluke to see Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Gore fade into a background of towering cornstalks and bales of hay. Is it a backlash? The wives will never say.

NASA Chief Faces a Huge Foe in Cost Cutting

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
NASA's new administrator, lean, mean and ready do things differently, may have met his match as he wrestles with plans he inherited for a monster project that is overweight, over budget and overly political in this election year. The would-be orbiting outpost for astronauts, known as space station Freedom, could easily foil efforts at slenderizing. The cold war's end and a lingering recession have produced a major slump in the aerospace industry that no politician wants to deepen right now with a new round of layoffs.
"He has made it very clear from the beginning that he's going to trim the fat out of NASA," said Jerry Grey, head of science and technology policy for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, an engineering society based in Washington. "But he's not going to make any major changes till after the election." 
 The space station, the centerpiece of NASA's ambitious plans for this decade and the next century, has become an unpleasant example of how badly big science can go awry. When first proposed by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, it was to be a relatively modest, $8 billion project of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that would push back scientific frontiers and be completed in 1992, in time for the 500th anniversary of Columbus' journey to the new world.
Over time, however, its proposed size grew as NASA formed a web of scientific and contractor alliances meant to shield the project from political foes. Today, after $8 billion in design work, it is envisioned as a 350-foot hulk costing between $30 billion and $40 billion to build, with 30-year operating expenses estimated at up to $100 billion. The space shuttles would begin lofting its parts in 1995, and after 18 such flights, the structure would be permanently occupied by about the year 2000.
Its defenders say it would be useful for studying the long-term effects of weightlessness, for growing super-pure materials and crystallizing proteins that medicine needs to study and for enabling astronomical observations. Cynics say it is an extremely expensive way to do research that has either already been done on the Russian space station Mir or is not crucial anyway.
Last year Congress threatened to scrap the outpost, prompting NASA to flood Capitol Hill with promotional packets. "Space station dollars are spent on the ground!" declared one, which added that the project had a "procurement constituency" of more than 2,000 businesses in 40 states. It warned that for the Houston area alone, killing the station would mean a loss of 11,100 jobs.
Enter Daniel S. Goldin, a 52-year-old native New Yorker and industry executive with no Washington job experience who in April took NASA's helm, ready to ignite a revolution and get the agency making innovative spacecraft again -- for less money. "He's a faster, cheaper, better kind of guy," said a White House official. "He's obviously outside the NASA culture."
At TRW Inc., one of the nation's top aerospace contractors, Mr. Goldin had been influenced by the small-is-beautiful school of aerospace design, which argues that the revolution in miniaturization has opened up new ways to explore the heavens inexpensively.
At NASA Mr. Goldin started an exercise in which "red teams" and "blue teams" fought each other to find potential cost reductions of 20 percent to 40 percent. But the results on the station program were lackluster. And he did something more basic, telling the new team to explore the option of lofting the sprawling outpost without using shuttles.
 
Ride a Russian Rocket?
 "It's the first time since 1970 that there will be a serious look at what's the best station to build, rather than the best one that can fit in the shuttle," said Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the space policy institute at George Washington University and a station historian.
The most radical outcome would be for NASA to loft station parts on a 20-story Russian rocket known as Energia, whose services the Russians have repeatedly offered. Energia, which has flown only twice and thus has unproven reliability, can in theory lift five times as much as the shuttle. And pulling back on shuttles might free billions for other NASA projects since they currently consume about half the agency's $15 billion annual budget.
The issue now facing Mr. Goldin is whether rational analysis can be reconciled with bureaucratic inertia and election-year politics. Vice President Dan Quayle, who heads the National Space Council, recently told workers at Douglas Space Systems in Huntington Beach, Calif., a major space station contractor, that their future would be assured if the Republicans stayed in power.
"As long as George Bush is President, space station Freedom is safe and so are your jobs," he told 3,500 workers on Aug. 12. Gov. Bill Clinton, contrary to Mr. Quayle's jab, has voiced support for the outpost and also advocates more teamwork with the Russians.
Experts say some slimming or delays are inevitable no matter who wins, given Congressional cutbacks. The station recently survived a major floor fight in the House, which nonetheless gave it only $1.7 billion of the Bush Administration's $2.25 billion request. The Senate gave it $2.1 billion, and the conference committee will probably split the difference at $1.9 billion.
John E. Pike, head of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists, a private group, said that, in the end, Mr. Goldin would probably be forced to make minor rearrangements in the status quo.
"My hunch," he said, "is that it's going to be like Churchill and democracy -- that space station Freedom is a bad program but all the alternatives are worse."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Overview;
NOMINEES CRITICIZE EACH OTHER'S PLAN TO REVIVE ECONOMY

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22

 BODY:
The race for the Presidency began in earnest this weekend, as President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton engaged in a furious exchange over each other's economic proposals and, by extension, their political character.
The opening debate set the tone and the subject matter for what strategists in both campaigns predict will be a harsh and brutally competitive 10-week struggle that could ultimately come down to a handful of states in the industrial Midwest. 
 Mr. Bush, reveling in polls that show him closing in on the Democrats, rolled through Georgia today with another attack on Mr. Clinton as a committed taxer and spender who would conspire with the Democratic Congress to plunder the budget.
 
Bush Emphasizes Trust
 "I'm going to ask the American people, who do you trust to bring it all home?" Mr. Bush declared at a rally of 20,000 people in Woodstock, Ga. "Foreign policy, security policy, economic policy, who do you trust?"
He added, to a roaring crowd that chanted his name: "If you listen to these guys, and you'd think the deficit is a big game of the 'Wheel of Fortune.' You know that one? They want to buy three vowels -- i.o.u. That's not good enough for the American taxpayer."
Mr. Clinton moved quickly this weekend to try to defuse Mr. Bush's promise of new across-the-board tax cuts by characterizing it as a cynical, empty gimmick with as little shelf life as Mr. Bush's promise four years ago of "no new taxes."
 
Clinton Sees 'Bogus' Claim
 Traveling on another bus trip through the critical state of Ohio, Mr. Clinton asserted that Mr. Bush's plans to revive the economy were "totally bogus." The Democratic nominee, campaigning in Parma, asserted that "he can't battle me on the economy" and contended that Mr. Bush had "imperiled our national security by having no economic policy."
Senator Al Gore, the Vice-Presidential nominee, demanded, "Do you want four more years of a read-my-lips recession?"
The first round of post-convention polls shows, once again, the extraordinary volatility of the electorate this year, with Mr. Clinton's once-formidable lead significantly eroded. A new poll for The Los Angeles Times, conducted Thursday and Friday and released today, showed Mr. Clinton now leading by 8 percentage points, down from a lead of more than 20 points the week before.
 
Travels Reflect Battlefields
 Analysts in both parties said that beneath the wild swings in the polls was the reality of a intensely competitive race in an angry and economically anxious year. "This is the most open, fickle, volatile electorate we've ever seen," said Peter Hart, a Democratic poll taker.
The candidates' travel schedules over the coming week are a road map to where this election will be fought, won and lost. Mr. Bush roared out of his convention this weekend into the South, ordinarily a Republican bastion but newly competitive this year because of the all-Southern Democratic ticket. Bush campaign advisers say they hope to consolidate their electoral base in that region and the Mountain West, then carry the battle to a belt of industrial states, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois.
The Bush advisers say this would enable them to assemble a winning majority in the electoral vote, which is 270, even without carrying California, where the Democrats have had wide leads in this summer's polls. This explains why Mr. Bush will be at the Illinois State Fair on Sunday, and will be back in Illinois and Michigan by midweek, after a swing through Connecticut and New Jersey, where the campaign also has high hopes.
Roman Catholic voters are expected to be an important part of this industrial state strategy; they are a principal target of Mr. Bush's "school-choice" proposal, which would give parents vouchers they can use in private or religious schools. Republicans also expect them to respond to the appeal of "family values."
The Bush campaign hopes to raise economic fears in those states with its attacks on Mr. Clinton as a tax-and-spend liberal and to suggest that the Democratic ticket would put the environment over jobs, particularly jobs in the automobile industry.
 
Messages From the Bus
 The Democrats, for their part, were back in a bus this weekend, rolling through Ohio, Pennsylvania and upstate New York. By midweek, they will be on another bus trip through Texas. While Texas has been a reliable part of the Republican coalition in years past, the Clinton campaign clearly has hopes there this year.
"We're going there for a reason," said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's deputy campaign manager.
The Clinton campaign is also trying hard to regain control of a debate it largely dominated for a solid month after the Democratic convention in New York. "Obviously, the credibility of what Bush said Thursday night will be very important to the future of this race," said Stan Greenberg, the Clinton campaign's poll taker.
Mr. Clinton and his advisers wasted little time in attacking Mr. Bush's economic proposals for across-the-board tax cuts and spending caps. They called them irresponsible gimmicks, with James Carville, a top Clinton strategist, asserting, "We're going to make them eat the numbers."
Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign, countered: "They're just calling Bush a liar, which I don't believe will work. I don't believe they want to get into a contest of who's the most trustworthy, although it's fine with us if that's what they want to do."
The Clinton campaign was also moving quickly to paint the Republicans' "family values" appeal, which reached a peak at this week's convention, as pandering to the party's right wing.
 
Predictions of Ugly Contest
 "We don't believe American families want Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell and Pat Buchanan defining their values," Mr. Carville said. "We're going to remind the American people who was in control of that convention. They are going to hear again and again about Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell running the convention and running the government."
Both sides predicted that the tone of the race would be ugly, and predictably blamed each other for it. "They're going to deliberately make it nasty because they don't want to talk about the real issues," said Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic National chairman.
Mr. Hart, the Democratic poll taker, said the Republican convention was filled with innuendo and outright attacks on the character of Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, who was assailed as a militant feminist who equated marriage with slavery.
Noting that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was back in political control, Mr. Hart said: "The last time around we said it was Lee Atwater's campaign; this time it's clearly Jim Baker's. He's laid his first marker down, and it's going to be brass knuckles."
The Republicans countered that their party hardly had the franchise on negative politics. "I think Clinton's losing his composure and we haven't even started yet," said Mary Matalin, deputy manager of the Bush campaign. "As Phil Gramm said, he's been running up and down the field by himself -- and there's another team on the field now."
The pace of this campaign, already unusually intense for summer, will only escalate, both sides said; the traditional start of a campaign on Labor Day has become a mere formality. Robert M. Teeter, chairman for the Bush campaign, told reporters this week that Mr. Bush "will not take any sustained period of time off and he'll be out campaigning from now on."

Eighteen months after they helped the multi-national coalition chase Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, Egypt and Syria are keeping a distance from their former Western partners, who are bracing for another military showdown with Iraq.
In Damascus, Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said on Friday that his Government rejected outright plans by the United States, Britain and France to bar Iraqi combat planes and helicopters from flying over southern Iraq, where they have been attacking Shiite Muslim dissidents. 
 Although the Syrian Government is a bitter foe of Mr. Hussein, Mr. Sharaa said Syria was as opposed to its former Western allies' threatening the "territorial integrity" of Iraq as it was to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait two years ago.
In its public pronouncements, Egypt, which is heavily dependent on American economic and military aid, has been much more circumspect, and neither President Hosni Mubarak nor anyone else has directly challenged the plan for what the Western allies call a "no fly" zone.
 
No Partition, Egyptian Insists
 But in remarks on Thursday, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa declared that Egypt was opposed to any attempt to "partition" Iraq, a buzzword among Arab critics who see the allied plan as leading to a de facto partition, since it would divide the country into a Kurdish region in the north and a Shiite Muslim region in the south, framing a Sunni Muslim region between them.
So far, the plan to create the protected zone, which British officials say will go into effect sometime early next week, has won the qualified support of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, which will once again furnish landing fields for allied planes involved in the operation.
Editorial comment in Egypt's semi-official press, and Egyptian officials speaking behind the scenes, have been sharply critical of the plan. For example, Samir Ragab, whose commentaries often reflect official thinking, said today that the United States initiative sets a dangerous precedent.
"What Iraq faces today could be repeated tomorrow in many other Arab countries," he wrote in the English-language Egyptian Mail.
 
Al Ahram Watches U.S. Voters
 In another editorial today, Al Ahram, Egypt's leading newspaper, suggested that the timing of any military confrontation with Iraq appeared to be governed by what it described as "narrow political interests," including what it said was President Bush's calculation that a military strike on Iran would benefit him in the fall election.
Such reactions are sharp departures Cairo's strong role in helping shape the allied coalition that faced down Iraq over Kuwait.
Cairo and Damascus not only furnished important political cover for the American-led task force but they also contributed troops to the multinational force, about 35,000 from Egypt and about 20,000 from Syria.
Some Egyptian officials fear that the latest plan is a recipe for instability and could strengthen the hand of Iran. In Mr. Moussa's remarks, in which he also called on Iraq to stop persecuting its own minorities and abide with United Nations accords, the Foreign Minister warned of certain "regional schemes" to exploit the situation.
Western diplomats here said he was making a veiled reference to Iran, which in the past has furnished weapons, money and fighters to support Shiite rebels battling Iraqi forces.
 
The Greater Fear
 Although Persian Gulf countries also fear the Islamic leadership in Iran and do not want to see it extend its reach into the south, they are more worried about the possible revival of Mr. Hussein and his military.
Newspapers and political leaders in Iran have also attacked the allied plan to provide air cover for the Shiites. Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi, the head Iran's judiciary, said Friday that Iran continued to be opposed to all "satanic" designs by the United States.
But at the same time, Iranian radio and news agencies have provided a regular forum for Shiite rebel leaders in Iraq, to make the case to the rest of the world they are under siege by Baghdad and need a safe haven.
In Baghdad today, Prime Minister Mohammed Hamza al-Zubaydi told a special Cabinet meeting that Iraq would mobilize "all our official and popular potential" to resist the allied plan to impose a closed air zone over the south of the country.
"The three imperialist countries are terrified of Iraq's steadfastness in the face of the unjust blockade that has been in force for more than three years," he said.

HEADLINE: Baker's Deputy, Now Acting Secretary, Presses Ahead With a Full Schedule

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the career diplomat whose conservative pinstripes do little to dampen his exuberant personality, takes over as Acting Secretary of State on Sunday with neither illusions nor regrets.
"I am nothing if not clear about who I am," he said in an interview on Thursday in the opulent Deputy Secretary's suite, which he will keep when he assumes direction of the State Department at one of its busiest moments in recent times. Across the foyer, the office of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who moves to the White House as chief of staff, will remain empty. 
 Mr. Eagleburger is expected to remain as Acting Secretary at least until after the elections in November, when the future of the Bush Administration will be decided.
"I'm going to be the Acting Secretary of State for some months through an accident of history, and I understand that," Mr. Eagleburger said. "I also understand that I am not Secretary of State for four years and should therefore not be thinking about whither the foreign policy of the United States in the year 2000."
 
Is He a Caretaker?
 But he added, with the gusto and informality that contrast markedly with the self-controlled demeanor of Mr. Baker: "I'm going to do the best damn job I can do in this period of time."
Does that make him a caretaker?
"If you want to ask a nasty question, I suppose in one sense that's true, yes," he said. "I don't happen to think that makes any difference. I'm going to do what has to be done. I'm going to try to deal with issues in as creative a way as I can."
Last week, Mr. Baker and his departing inner circle of top advisers let it be known that they plan to stay engaged in foreign policy. As one of them told reporters: "The fact that we are going to the White House does not mean that we are in any way precluded from being actively involved to the extent that we have time to be or want to be."
Mr. Eagleburger is a State Department management expert whom colleagues describe as a practical administrator. He reaches down for advice into the far corners of the building's six floors where area specialists often felt neglected by Mr. Baker and his close-knit group.
"I'm going to use all the instruments of the building, whether Foreign Service or not," he said from his seventh-floor suite. "But there are going to be some times when I am going to want to decide things up here."
 
Sees No Major Changes
 He added, however: "I don't think you should expect any very major changes in the way the place operates. I happen to think Jim Baker ran it pretty well."
And he says he will not hesitate to call on Mr. Baker when needed.
"One obvious area I can identify right now, where I wouldn't hesitate for a minute to pick up the phone and call him, is on the Middle East," he said. "He's lived it, he's breathed it, he's created it and it would be insane for me and for the country if I weren't prepared to ask him for help when we needed it. I think that would be less true in other areas."
Mr. Eagleburger, a University of Wisconsin graduate who joined the Foreign Service in 1957, retired from the department in 1984 but returned as Deputy Secretary of State at President Bush's request in 1989. Despite Mr. Baker's shadow, he says he expects to enjoy considerable autonomy at the State Department.
 
In Charge "in Reality"
 "Jim Baker's made it clear to me, the President's made it clear, I'm not only legally but in reality in charge for the period of time left," he said.
The new Acting Secretary of State has a very full schedule.
On Monday, only an hour after a new round of Mideast peace talks are scheduled to begin in Washington, Mr. Eagleburger, who is 62 years old and not in the best of health, will be taking off for London to press for a more coherent international response to the continuing carnage in what was once Yugoslavia, where he served as Ambassador a decade ago.
His long association with Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital and now the center of a Serbian nationalist movement that is tearing Bosnia and Herzegovina apart, has elicited criticisms from Bosnians, Muslims and Croatians, as well as from Democrats in Congress who say he moved too slowly in responding to the crisis. Mr. Eagleburger has acknowledged that he may have misjudged the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, whom he remembered as a more reasonable man before Yugoslavia slid into chaos.
 
Trouble With Iraq Looms
 Mr. Eagleburger is opposed to the use of force against the Serbs to bring peace to Bosnia, saying that Yugoslav history suggests that "putting foreign troops on the soil there would make the situation worse, not better."
In a matter of days, tension building over Iraq may turn into open confrontation if President Saddam Hussein persists in flying sorties against the Shiite Muslim population in the southern region near Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The United States and its allies are expected to issue an ultimatum to Iraq next week that it must stop the flights or risk having the planes shot down.
In September, Washington's Asian economic partners want Mr. Eagleburger to attend a high-level meeting in Bangkok on Pacific area trade and other issues that have been eclipsed by American concentration on the former Soviet empire and the Middle East.
"I'd better have some time for Asia," he said, listing his concerns, among them the intransigence of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, the need to patch up relations with the Philippines and the steady movement toward the diplomatic recognition of Hanoi.
 
The Importance of Japan
 "The real question in the Pacific is obviously Japan," Mr. Eagleburger said. "In the last analysis, the U.S.-Japanese relationship is so important to both of us that neither one of us is going to be so insane that we are going to tear it apart," he said.
Mr. Eagleburger, who left government service in the 1980's to work for the consulting company of his friend and associate Henry A. Kissinger, also said that the consequences of the collapse of the Soviet Union would be "with this Administration for the rest of the term and into the next term and for a long time for all of us."
A motif running through American policy in all areas of the world, Mr. Eagleburger said, is the increasing reliance on international organizations, from the Organization of American States in Haiti to the European Community or the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe for Yugoslavia.
"One of the things we are seeing is that, except in exceptional circumstances like Iraq, one superpower in an otherwise not-superpower world often means that your superpower strength is not applicable," he said. "And therefore you've got to find other instruments and institutions that you can use to bring weight to bear -- including our own superpower status, but in a context that can make it useful."
 
Status of His Health
 Mr. Eagleburger, who frequently walks with a cane after the replacement of a kneecap, and who recently appeared at the State Department with his arm in a cast, is a heavy smoker who alternates cigarettes with squirts of spray to control a perennial problem with asthma. He admits to being overweight.
But the cane and the cast were gone when he strode into the sitting-room area of his suite for an interview, and he greeted a question about his health with a look of resignation.
"I have read enough in the last two weeks to convince myself I have one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel," he said. "But I can assure you that for whatever period of time is necessary, I will be careful not to let the banana peel slip."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush, in Georgia, Questions Clinton's Vision of the Family

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WOODSTOCK, Ga., Aug. 22

 BODY:
In a small Southern town that looked like a set for Andy Griffith's Mayberry, President Bush raised doubts today about the Democrats' vision of family, and his surrogate cited Woody Allen as symbolizing the party's values.
As many as 20,000 exuberant supporters packed the center of town and remained buoyant through a driving rain as Mr. Bush said he understood "the American way" and warned that Mr. Clinton was in league with a "gridlocked Congress" that would neglect the crowd's interests. 
 "It's a choice about the character of the man that you want to lead this nation for another four years," said Mr. Bush, who was drenched after refusing an umbrella. The choice, he added, was about "our belief in a strong defense, in strong families and in leaving the world a better and more prosperous place for the young kids here today."
 
An All-Out Assault
 Signaling that he was primed for battle, Mr. Bush closed with these words: "So you tell Governor Clinton and that Congress, 'If you can't run with the big dogs, stay under the porch.' "
Mr. Bush's feisty language was tame compared with the warm-up act, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who represents this town north of Atlanta and who repeatedly attacked the Democrats as having "weird values."
In his all-out assault on the Democrats before Mr. Bush arrived in this town of storefronts draped with American flags, Mr. Gingrich, the second-ranking House Republican, cited Woody Allen, who has professed love for the daughter of his former lover, Mia Farrow. Ms. Farrow has accused Mr. Allen of sexually abusing her young daughter.
"I call this the Woody Allen plank," Mr. Gingrich said. "It's a weird situation, and it fits the Democratic party platform perfectly. If a Democrat used the word 'family' to raise children in Madison Square Garden, half their party would have rebelled and the other half would not vote."
He added: "Woody Allen had nonincest with his nondaughter because they were a nonfamily."
 
Bush Compliments Gingrich
 The Bush campaign sought to distance the President from Mr. Gingrich's comments. "We do not stand foursquare behind every single statement each of these surrogates makes," said Tony Mitchell, the campaign's deputy press secretary. "And, no, the President does not want to make Woody Allen an issue."
Still, Mr. Bush complimented Mr. Gingrich as someone "who helps us so much in Washington," and went on in his remarks to emphasize the family-values issue. As "the best evidence" of his commitment to family values, the President introduced his wife, Barbara, as "a great First Lady who stands for the family and family values." The crowd then broke into chants of "Barbara! Barbara!"
The President continued his pro-family, anti-Clinton, anti-Congress themes as he went on to another rain-soked rally of thousands in Hoover, Ala., where he accused Mr. Clinton of proposing the biggest tax increase in history, an assertion the Democrat rebuts. "They talk about change," Mr. Bush said. "The only thing you'll have in your pocketbook is change if this guy gets elected."
 
Tax Cut Not Mentioned
 Buoyed by polls that show him closing in on Mr. Clinton since the Republican convention, Mr. Bush has eagerly taken on his rival. But he has barely mentioned the across-the-board tax-cut proposal that was a core theme of his acceptance speech, and he did not disclose details of the plan today.
In fact, Mr. Mitchell said he was not sure "whether the specifics will be decided by the election or not." But he rejected Mr. Clinton's assertion that Mr. Bush was a "great fear monger" on economics. "It's not that we're trying to stir up fears," Mr. Mitchell said. "We're just trying to point out a legitimate economic policy difference."
Mr. Gingrich, who aides said was furious over Mr. Bush's reneging on his "no new taxes" pledge in 1990 but now attacks Mr. Clinton's economic proposals, told reporters the President should lay out details of his proposal. There was no mention of Mr. Gingrich's overdrafts at the House bank when Mr. Bush derided the "rubber-check Congress."
It was Mr. Gingrich's oratory this morning that demonstrated how far the Republicans might go in questioning Mr. Clinton's trustworthiness and character. He was particularly critical of Mr. Clinton's appearance on MTV, when the Democratic candidate said with a smile that maybe he should have inhaled marijuana -- a joke about his oft-repeated comment that he had tried the drug but "didn't inhale."
"He has a deep psychological need to pander to the worst instincts of whatever group he's in front of," Mr. Gingrich said. "He, in effect, said to these kids it was all right to inhale."
Mr. Gingrich called the Governor's comment "a sick thing" and "the most single destructive action by a politician in my lifetime."

CLINTON BORROWS TOUGH G.O.P. TACTIC

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Striving to hold his ground in what polls show is a tightening race for President, Gov. Bill Clinton is relying on a tactic that the Republicans used in their convention and in the campaign: blending attacks on the opponent with softer themes and images intended to make the candidate personally attractive.
For example, on Friday, Mr. Clinton came close to calling President Bush a liar in the morning, then embarked on a telegenically warm and fuzzy bus tour with his running mate, Senator Al Gore, and their wives that afternoon. 
 Even as Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore court enthusiastic crowds in the Rust Belt this weekend and in Texas and Louisiana later this week, the Arkansas Governor's attacks have sharpened, with the veneer of his genial smile softening them only a little.
 
The Opening Salvos
 "George Bush is a lot more interested in beating me than in helping you," Mr. Clinton told the Detroit Economic Club in a speech that included the substantive opening salvos of the fall campaign. "He can't say anything about his record, so he just says anything to stay in power."
In a campaign that suddenly seems more October than August, the attack-and-retreat technique will require tit for tat, slug for slug, and both parties seem prepared to line up their battering rams long before Labor Day.
Although this blend of positive and negative campaigning is closely identified with Republicans in the last three elections, Mr. Clinton got plenty of practice in it during the process of dispensing of his Democratic primary opponents and then building a lead over Mr. Bush in mid-summer.
Mr. Clinton's top aides say they are not alarmed by the new public opinion polls suggesting that the Republican convention helped President Bush erase most of Mr. Clinton's lead. "We planned for it," said Dee Dee Myers, Mr. Clinton's press secretary. "We always expected they would have a convention that was good for them. We planned to be slugging it out all fall. The polls will bounce around and will not settle down before next week."
Mr. Clinton's analysts also say they planned two alternate responses to Mr. Bush's convention speech: one if he introduced dramatic new policy initiatives, which he did not; the other if he did not offer anything substantially new.
 
Intention Was to Respond
 "The intention was always to respond," Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's polltaker said, here after Mr. Clinton's speech on Friday. "Had the President given a genuine policy address and advanced an economic plan, you would have seen economic plan against economic plan. But he raised the trust issue, and we joined the trust issue."
Ms. Myers said: "I think that the long view of the speech is going to be that he proposed an across-the-board tax cut, health care for every American, vouchers to send children to private schools, a capital gains tax cut -- all of that without proposing how he would pay for it. He's going to have a lot of explaining to do once the election unfolds."
The campaign at this point is a contest to see which candidate can emerge as both stronger and more attractive. The Democrats are counting on what they believe is a permanent sense of exasperation with Mr. Bush among the voters, and Clinton strategists are also arguing that their candidate will prove more intrinsically attractive than previous Democratic nominees have.
From the campaign's polling, said one strategist, "the one thing we have here is people who don't want to vote for Bush." The Clinton forces find hope in that because, the strategist added, "Mondale was ahead of Reagan and Carter was ahead of Reagan, but they lost because people just didn't want to vote for Carter and Mondale."
Mr. Clinton and his advisers also sense that an opening exists to persuade voters that Mr. Bush is ultimately responsible for deficits, inflation, joblessness and other economic troubles.
The determination of the Clinton forces to respond quickly to Bush attacks has become an article of faith in the third-floor "war room" at the campaign headquarters in Little Rock, Ark. Mr. Bush was still delivering his acceptance speech at the Republican convention on Thursday night when Clinton aides began dispensing their rebuttal, which was faxed, copied and slipped under the hotel doors of reporters traveling with Mr. Clinton by midnight.
 
Playing the 'Trust' Card
 Quick response, whether to personal accusations, attacks on Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary, or assaults on the specifics of the Democrats' proposals, kills further inquiry, they reason.
At the same time, the Clinton organization is working to build voter trust while exploiting voter distrust of Mr. Bush, using every available opportunity to point out that the President reversed his pledge not to raise taxes. Mr. Bush has made "trust" a major theme of his campaign.
At times, Clinton aides seem to long for their old underdog status. In the role of challengers, they say, they will be better able to drive home another portion of their fall strategy: they want to cast the Republicans as fat-cat insiders who are out of the mainstream.
"They are desperate to hold on to the White House," Mr. Clinton told reporters last week, repeating an observation he had made more than once. "They cannot imagine what life would be like if they didn't have Camp David and they didn't have all the dinners at the White House and they didn't have all the perks and powers of the Presidency. The national Bush crowd think it belongs to them. They will do anything to hold it."
The Democrats were happy to seize on the call by Patrick J. Buchanan, in his run for the Republican nomination, for Americans to "take our culture back." They accuse the Republicans of "narrow casting" their appeal to alienated white males and religious conservatives.
"They are running to the right," said James Carville, a senior Clinton strategist. "The religious right, it's like they wrote the platform."
 
The Scrappy Victims
 Another emerging Clinton theme is that the Democrats are the scrappy and noble victims of unfair Republican attacks.
When Mr. Clinton criticizes Mr. Bush, it is with a slightly pained tone, but he seemed to relish defending his wife when Republican speakers and officials attacked her during their convention last week.
Mrs. Clinton, playing her role in the campaign's master plan, refused to be drawn into the debate, instead letting her husband rise to her defense and to the defense of their daughter, Chelsea, whom they have adamantly protected from the press and the political fray.
"They want one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everybody else," Mr. Clinton complained at one point. "They want to be nice people except when they need votes, in which case they want to trash their opponents. The worst example of all, of course, is the way they have just grossly distorted Hillary's work and tried to target her. They go around and extol family values and attack my family. Before you know it, they'll be after Chelsea."

HEADLINE: Times Sq. Subway Station Plan Is Canceled

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
The postponement of a plan to build four giant office towers in Times Square has forced the New York City Transit Authority to abandon a $165 million project to renovate the ramshackle Times Square subway station, dealing another blow to efforts to revitalize the neighborhood.
The Transit Authority's proposal for the labyrinthine station, the second busiest in the subway system, had depended on an investment of $90 million from the office towers' developers, the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty. But now that the recession has prompted state and city officials to release the developers from their obligation to construct the towers anytime soon, the subway project is neither financially nor structurally feasible. 
 "Frankly, we don't know what we're going to do," said Jerome Forman, senior vice president at the Transit Authority. "The strategy that was in place is not going ahead."
 
Commuters Still Stranded
 The subway project had been a centerpiece of the Times Square redevelopment plan. It was supposed to transform the station, which connects eight subway lines and serves more than 200,000 passengers a day, into a bright, clean and efficient transportation hub, thereby encouraging more people to visit the Times Square area. Commuters have long voiced disgust over the station's gloomy and sometimes threatening corridors.
The renovations, which took a team of 20 architects and engineers more than five years and $16 million to design, would have been the most extensive ever undertaken by the Transit Authority. They had been scheduled to start in 1991, but were delayed by design and engineering problems and concern over the schedule for the office towers.
But even before the tower project was postponed, some subway-rider groups had criticized the plans as excessive, saying that the Transit Authority should use its money for more basic improvements, like new signs and lighting, instead of rebuilding the complex. They also raised concerns about the Transit Authority's policy of relying on money from developers at the mercy of fluctuations of the real-estate market.
 
Station Opened in 1904
 The Times Square station opened in 1904 when the city's first subway, built by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, was completed. Since then, the station has expanded haphazardly, creating a jumble of confusing passageways. The renovation was intended to change that.
The Transit Authority had intended a four-year construction effort. Successive sections of the station were to be renovated as a central rotunda, six new entrances and five elevators for the elderly and the handicapped were built. The plan was so complicated that workers would have raised an entire block of Seventh Avenue by one foot, relocated a 48-inch water main and moved thousands of cables.
To modernize the shuttle to Grand Central Station, contractors would have ripped up one of its tracks and built a central platform for the remaining two. The Transit Authority would have peppered the station with new lights and signs and art by Roy Lichtenstein, Jacob Lawrence and Jack Beal.
But the blueprints for the renovation were intricately linked to the construction of the four towers along Broadway and Seventh Avenue between 41st and 43d streets.
 
An Integrated Design
 "A lot of the configuration of the subway station was predicated on the buildings," Mr. Forman said. "Some of the entrances to the subway would come up through the buildings. It was a very integrated design."
The Transit Authority had expected to combine $75 million from its capital budget with the developers' $90 million, so its own money is still available for a smaller project.
Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, a state agency, said she was exploring a proposal that would allow the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the parent body of the Transit Authority, to supplement the $75 million with money from its capital budget. The extra money is expected to be reimbursed from "project revenues" to the developers when the towers are eventually built, she said.
But Mr. Forman said that even if the Transit Authority received more money, it could not simply trim the old plans because their engineering and architectural specifications were so connected to the tower plans. At the earliest, he estimated, work on a smaller project could not begin before 1994.
He added that even if the Transit Authority decided to confine its renovations to the shuttle platforms, his engineers would still have to redraw much of their previous plan for that section of the station.
"I don't think anybody should rush out and commit these kind of funds to something that isn't well thought out," he said. "At this point, none of the options are great, none of them are easy and they will all take a commitment of time and money."
 
'Back to Square One'
 Some advocates for subway riders said they hoped the postponement of the renovations might force the Transit Authority to re-examine its original project and realize that it was too ambitious.
"They should go back to square one," said Joseph G. Rappaport, coordinator for the Straphangers Campaign. "They should not try to cut the plan in half."
Mr. Rappaport said the Transit Authority was foolish to spend so much money on a single station when much of the subway system's infrastructure was outmoded.
Some commuters who regularly pass through Times Square said they were irked by the prospect of years of delay on the renovations.
"This station is run down and it's unpleasant," Vinette Noel said on Friday morning as she waited for the No. 1 train to take her to the Upper West Side, where she works as a housekeeper. "It makes me feel as if I want to avoid riding the subway. I wish they'd clean it up and get it over with."
Mary Castria, who commutes into Manhattan from New Jersey, said she long ago steeled herself to the station. But she worried about its effect on the legions of tourists who troop through Times Square every day.
"It's dirty and it smells," she said. "You see a lot of people from out of town here and you wonder what they think of it."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Bus Tour;
CLINTON DISMISSES HIS DROP IN POLLS

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARMA, Ohio, Aug. 22

 BODY:
His once-formidable lead in the polls much diminished, Gov. Bill Clinton campaigned relentlessly today in the nation's economically troubled industrial Midwest in search of new campaign momentum.
He dismissed the new voter surveys showing that the Republican National Convention had given President Bush a significant lift. "I didn't trust the polls when I had a big lead and I don't trust them now," he said. "But I don't think the people are going to lose their trust in me on the basis of some Republican attacks in Houston." 
 In the end, the Democrat nominee predicted, the election will be decided by voter dissatisfaction with an incumbent President who, Mr. Clinton asserted, could not be trusted and had no vision to save a nation mired in economic troubles.
"I think as the days go by the people will see the whole thing was a gimmick," Mr. Clinton said when asked about the Republicans' convention, which ended in Houston on Thursday.
 
Vowing to Be Different
 "You've got to remember," he continued, "that they ran the most negative convention in anybody's memory. They threw the kitchen sink at us. They did that on prime-time television."
The Clinton-Gore campaign, the Arkansas Governor vowed, would not stoop to such tactics.
"We're just going to go back to our positive campaign," he said, "and tell people what we're going to do to put them back to work."
The President and Vice President Dan Quayle might take issue with that assertion. Over the past two days, since the polls first indicated that Mr. Bush was closing the gap on Mr. Clinton, the Arkansas Governor and his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, have stepped up and sharpened their attacks.
Again and again they have tried to turn the favorite Republican issues of trust and family values on the President and Mr. Quayle. In more than one instance, Mr. Clinton has accused the President, without equivocation, of knowingly telling untruths about the Clinton and Gore political records.
Again and again Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have asserted that if the President and Mr. Quayle truly believe in family values, they would do more for the children of America.
"How can you be for family values when you don't value family?" Mr. Clinton said at a street rally here this afternoon. "It's harder to raise children now than it was four years ago. I value your children."
 
Some Disenchantment
 Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, along with their wives, Hillary and Tipper, are midway through a three-day bus trip across the southern rim of Lake Erie, from Detroit to Buffalo.
The crowds, ranging from several thousand here to about 5,000 last night in Cleveland, have frequently roared their approval of Mr. Clinton's promises to put American back to work, particularly the people of the industrial Midwest, traditionally an important political battleground in all Presidential campaigns.
But while the crowds along the route of the bus trip have been mostly friendly to Mr. Clinton, random conversations with bystanders indicate the polls very well may be right at this point.
"I just don't know what I'm going to do in November," Anna Anders, an unemployed bookkeeper, said after shaking Mr. Clinton's hand at the street rally here. "I keep trying to get off the fence, but no one has really convinced me to do it yet. I'm worried about my country. But for the moment you could say I'm watching and waiting."
In Cleveland this morning, Mr. Clinton told a clutch of well-wishers and reporters waiting outside his hotel not to be fooled by "all the trash" put out about trust and family values at the Houston convention. He contended that the real issue of the campaign was the economy.
"George Bush can't battle on the economy," he said. "He's got the worst economic record in 50 years. International economics is now part of our national security and he has imperiled national security by having no economic policy."
Later at a rally for senior citizens in East Cleveland, a predominantly black suburb that is dotted with boarded-up factories and rubble-choked lots, Mr. Clinton accused Mr. Bush of ignoring the nation's urban needs.
"You need a President who wakes up every day thinking about these problems," he said.
Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, along on the bus trip to help with the campaigning, warmed up the senior citizens crowd. He characterized the Republican convention as "the biggest cover-up since Watergate."
That brought an audible chuckle from Mr. Clinton. And when it came time for the Governor to take the microphone from Mr. Bradley, he began by noting that Mr. Bradley was a former basketball all-star for the New York Knicks, then said:
"The biggest cover-up since Watergate -- now that's what I call a slam-dunk!"

HEADLINE: Town Rebuffs Big Company, Worrying L.I.

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BROOKVILLE, L.I., Aug. 21

 BODY:
The scene could have come straight from a New York neighborhood fighting to block a drug-treatment program or a shelter for the homeless: outraged neighbors complaining that an intruder would change the character of the streets, set a damaging precedent and lower property values.
The outsider, however, was Canon U.S.A. Inc., precisely the kind of company most communities dream of having in their tax base: a $4 billion nonpolluting giant that wanted to expand its headquarters on Long Island while other companies were shutting down and moving far from New York. 
 Yet despite a carefully drafted proposal intended to meet local concerns, the Japanese-owned camera and electronics company has been told to look elsewhere -- and may do so in another state -- continuing a frustrating, six-year hunt for a bigger home. "A decision like this is devastating," said David Farr, Canon's general manager, after learning of Brookville's intent to block the move.
 
Executives Fear Official Apathy
 Canon's search for a new headquarters has become one of Long Island's longest-running corporate sagas. Before setting its sights on Brookville, the company, which is based in Lake Success, spent two years trying to acquire a 50-acre parcel at Roosevelt Raceway in Hempstead. It finally gave up after the land became entangled in unrelated investigations of possible corruption in its acquisition by the current owners. The inquiry was dropped early this year.
Although Nassau County officials say the company has simply had a run of bad luck, business leaders say Canon's frustrations reflect a sluggishness on the part of state and county officials to keep companies from fleeing New York before it is too late.
"We've had some notorious failures in recent years," said James L. Larocca, president of the Long Island Association, a group representing developers and other major concerns. "This economy has lost one in 10 jobs. It's hard to reconcile that with appearing to thumb our noses at a company with the reputation of Canon."
In addition to frequent complaints about high energy costs and taxes, business leaders feel there is a grass-roots antagonism toward development that has discouraged public officials from openly supporting them, especially in conflicts with other local officials. Public opposition, though, usually focuses on projects that could claim woods or wetlands, and often seem a reaction to overdevelopment of earlier years.
In addition, because home rule gives taxing authority to more than 600 jurisdictions, means county officials are often reluctant to step in on local disputes. That is what happened to Canon.
 
Every Village a Kingdom
 "In our system of allocation of powers, the power to deal with this situation rests with a village government that apparently feels no relationship to the rest of the Long Island economy," Mr. Larocca said, pointing to Brookville's population of 3,000.
"You can't overestimate how important it is," Mitchell L. Moss, director of New York University's Urban Research Center, said of the town's attitude toward Canon. "There's no manufacturing. There's no polluting. It's exactly the kind of activity you want to keep in the region."
The Brookville Taxpayers Association, which spearheaded the local opposition, said it feared increased traffic and, most of all, opening the way for other corporate headquarters.
 Canon's search for a corporate headquarters began six years ago at the sand pits of Oyster Bay, a bleak stretch of industry on Long Island's North Shore. The company never bought the land, however, because soil borings showed the land was made of clay, and unable to support construction, said Richard Ignatow, a landscape architect who studied the soil conditions.
 
Raceway Is Considered
 Canon then considered Roosevelt Raceway, agreeing to pay $1 million an acre for 50 acres, but allegations of corruption involving the defunct raceway, unrelated to Canon's proposal, forced county officials to back out of the deal two years ago.
Around the same time, a board member at the New York Institute of Technology, a private institute in Old Westbury that is struggling through the recession with a $100 million debt, suggested that Canon consider the deSeversky Conference Center, a branch of the school situated on 100 acres in Brookville.
The conference center is an elegant 68-year-old brick mansion, not visible from any road or house in Brookville. Its marble halls, veranda and grand staircase are the stuff of fantasy. Canon had planned to refurbish the house and add another building for a work force it projected would grow by 1,000, to 1,800.
"We thought it was a gentle and low impact development," said William Udry, the school's senior vice president for finance. "The citizens felt it would lead to a precedent." Canon offered $20 million for the house and the land.
 
Local Political Maelstrom
 But Canon did not realize that it was plunging into a maelstrom of local politics in Brookville.
A wealthy enclave of sprawling estates, Brookville has been spared the economic jostles of the 1990's. With property taxes that range from $15,000 to $20,000 a year per home, the major preoccupation here is preserving what is commonly referred to as "a way of life." It is the same phrase North Shore residents used in the late 60's to keep the state from building a bridge connecting Oyster Bay to the rest of America via Rye, N.Y.
Over the course of the following year, Canon met with residents of Brookville and the surrounding villages, who raised a series of objections. Homeowners complained that Brookville's own master plan called for houses on lots of two to five acres. Canon agreed that it would only build on a total of five acres, including the mansion, thus preserving 95 acres of the campus's lawns, majestic oaks and weeping willows.
To answer concerns about the increased traffic, the institute -- whose student body was dwindling anyway -- agreed to lower its maximum enrollment to 6,000 from 7,500. Canon promised to build its parking garage underground. Another objection concerned groundwater protection, though some argued that one corporate headquarters on five acres would pose less of a threat than 20 homes on 100 acres.
 
'Commercialization' vs. Taxes
 Though the Taxpayers Association did not make much of it, Canon would also have put the property back on the tax rolls. According to one Canon-financed study, the company's taxes to Brookville would have totaled 25 percent of the village's total tax base. But since most property taxes go to the county, rather than the village, the impact on residential bills would have been much less than 25 percent.
"The community said the help to their property taxes was not the dominant factor in their mind, but that the further commercialization of the North Shore was," said Michael P. Galgano, the Mayor of Brookville.
The group contended in a flyer that Canon would produce "37 times more sewage, garbage, traffic and pollution" than 20 houses on the 100 acres.
Donald Siegel, a professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said of the association, "They've been somewhat immune to the recession, and that's reflected in their attitude about this."
 
Number of Foes Unclear
 It was never clear, however, whether the objections represented a groundswell or a restive minority.
Steven Glazer, the head of the Taxpayers Association and the losing candidate in the last mayoral election, said that he sent questionnaires to members in Brookville and the surrounding villages, and that nearly all the responses opposed Canon's coming to Brookville. He added, however, that only 10 to 20 percent of the surveys sent out were mailed back.
 
An Out-of-Town Audience
 Also, a sign-up sheet from the most contentious of the meetings between Canon and local homeowners shows that most of the 250 people who attended were not from Brookville but from nearby towns, said Jean Pailet, the Brookville Village Clerk.
Mr. Pailet said that it was a opinion by a lawyer for the village, rather than popular opposition, that swung the Mayor and village trustees against Canon. The decision said that a special exception from the residential zoning granted to the school for the deSeversky center could not be legally extended to Canon.
Canon only learned of the planned rejection after Mr. Galgano wrote to residents in early July that the board would probably turn Canon down at its next meeting.
Once again, the corporate giant was stung. "We genuinely believed that the project was a win-win proposition for all, including the village of Brookville, New York Tech, Canon U.S.A. and the larger Long Island community," Mr. Farr said.
In the aftermath, New York officials have rushed to soothe Canon's wounds. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo called Canon's president in Japan, Hideharu Takemoto, pledging to help Canon stay in New York.
New York officials are fashioning a package of tax breaks and other incentives. They have also proposed other possible homes, including a section of the State University of New York at Old Westbury and the Long Island Developmental Center.
Officials from Connecticut and New Jersey have hinted that they have also been trying to woo the corporate headquarters.
Here in Nassau County, Steven Latham, the man County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta has charged with keeping Canon in Nassau, proposed they take another look at Roosevelt Raceway.
"Now they don't appear to be interested when you could do it, though they were when you couldn't," Mr. Latham said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: News Analysis;
One Economy, 2 Visions

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Their gimmicks and vague promises aside, President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton present contrasting pictures of the state of the American economy and starkly different views about what needs to be done in the next four years.
Mr. Bush maintains that the American economy is inherently healthy and that the Government should take a hands-off approach and leave the free market alone. 
 Mr. Clinton holds that the economy is seriously off track and that the Government should step in and actively change the course.
 
Economy Leads Polls
 The economy is an important issue in any Presidential campaign, but rarely has it been so central as it is now. When voters have been asked in surveys this year what the most important problem is facing the country, the economy swamps all others.
And the Presidential candidates are giving the voters a clear choice on the matter.
Mr. Bush believes that wealthy Americans are taxed too much. Mr. Clinton would raise their taxes.
Mr. Bush would cut Government programs to the bone to lower the budget deficit. Mr. Clinton would expand Government spending on capital projects like roads and bridges, transportation systems and computer networks.
Mr. Bush would loosen Government regulations so businesses could become more prosperous. Mr. Clinton wants new regulations on business to protect the environment and force energy conservation.
Mr. Bush's ideas about health care and job training are grounded in tax incentives. Mr. Clinton would require employers to provide medical insurance and training to their employees or pay money to the Government to do the job for them.
 
Underscoring Differences
 Mr. Bush favors free trade at almost all costs. Mr. Clinton is increasingly taking the view that the United States should be tougher on its trading partners.
The sharp distinctions between the candidates' economic positions were underscored this week.
In his speech Thursday night in Houston accepting the Republican Presidential nomination, Mr. Bush declared, "Don't let anyone tell you that America is second rate." The main problem, he went on, was "a simple fact: Government is too big and spends too much."
Contrast that with what Mr. Clinton told the Detroit Economic Club in an hourlong luncheon speech on Friday.
"Our economy is struggling, and the American dream is in trouble," he asserted. The country, he said, needs the Government to develop "a national economic strategy."
Both candidates bemoan the budget deficit, which will approach $350 billion this year, the highest ever. But neither offers a clear prescription for what to do about it.
Mr. Bush favors a Constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and says he would put a spending cap on "mandatory programs." He offered a new gimmick on Thursday night: He would allow taxpayers to earmark up to 10 percent of their income taxes to reduce the national debt.
But those are empty promises without a specific accounting of which programs would be cut by how much. What would be spent on Medicare and Medicaid, on veterans' pensions, on farm-price supports? What would happen to food stamps, to unemployment compensation, to student loans? As has been the case throughout his Presidency, Mr. Bush declines to provide such an accounting, refusing to say specifically what he would like to cut and what he would like to preserve.
 
Evading Tough Moves
 Mr. Clinton says he would cut the deficit in half in four years. But his numbers are based largely on much more rapid economic growth than most economists think is likely, on lowering military spending by more than the Bush Administration is projecting and on automatic changes in the savings and loan program that will occur regardless of what the next President does. And he has his own gimmick: He would raise, he says, $45 billion over the next four years by tightening tax collection on foreign corporations that do business in the United States, a sum that even strong Clinton supporters see as at best an exaggeration.
The fact of the matter is, the only way to get a firm handle on the deficit is to raise taxes on ordinary Americans, reduce spending on popular programs or both -- steps neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Clinton is prepared to advocate in the heat of an election campaign.
But that does not diminish the contrast in the candidates' principles and programs. Nowhere is it clearer than in the case of taxes.
Mr. Clinton would raise the top tax rate, now 31 percent, to about 36 percent on taxpayers with total incomes above $200,000 a year. He would also stiffen the minimum tax owed by upper-income taxpayers who have many deductions and impose a 10 percent surtax on incomes over $1 million. He would use the revenue raised to give middle-income taxpayers a 10 percent tax cut or to give families with children a tax credit. He has never said precisely who would qualify for the tax cuts.
Mr. Bush promised the Republican convention on Thursday night that he would ask Congress to reduce taxes "across the board" if offsetting spending reductions could be found. The only two specific tax policies he mentioned were a lower capital-gains tax and a larger personal exemption, both of which would give maximum benefit to the wealthiest taxpayers.
Last spring Congress approved a bill that would have given Mr. Bush much of what he wanted in the way of taxes: a lower capital-gains rate for all but the richest 2 percent of taxpayers, expanded individual retirement accounts, tax breaks for the real estate industry and for business investments in plants and equipment, a lower minimum tax and a repeal of luxury taxes on yachts, furs, airplanes and jewelry.
Mr. Bush vetoed the measure because it would have balanced those tax reductions with the kind of higher taxes on the wealthy that Mr. Clinton wants.
The President holds that tax increases for the most affluent taxpayers would quickly devolve into tax increases for ordinary families. Mr. Clinton, the President said Thursday night, "says he wants to tax the rich, but, folks, he defines rich as anyone who has a job."
In his speech in Detroit, Mr. Clinton was equally caustic about Mr. Bush's philosophy, calling it "the wrongheaded notion that prosperity will trickle down if we just make the rich even richer and get the Government out of the way."
In many respects, this is the same argument that has been running through American politics since Roosevelt ran against Hoover, since Eisenhower ran against Stevenson, since Kennedy ran against Nixon -- the debate over the proper role of the Government and who should pay the taxes and whether income should be redistributed.
For all the talk in Madison Square Garden last month and in the Astrodome this week about abortion and welfare and family values and foreign affairs, this division over the economy may well be what decides the election of 1992.

HEADLINE: Art and Commerce: a College's Turbulent Tale

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAVANNAH, Ga.

 BODY:
Even before the pipe bomb explosion that led to the cancellation of graduation exercises, before the $12 million lawsuit by disgruntled students and the purge of skeptical faculty members and trustees, a lot of people here had begun to wonder just what was going on at the Savannah College of Art and Design.
Depending on who's talking, the college is either a model of entrepreneurial education -- an institution that in 14 years has gone from a mere idea to one of the largest of its kind in the nation -- or a place that deserves the contempt of protesting students who call it SCAM instead of SCAD. But at a time when the standard answer to everything from education to the Presidency is that it needs to be run like a business, there's an intriguing tale (call it "The Art College That Ate Savannah") in the combination of art, academics and commerce that surrounds the college. 
 Run by the family that started it, SCAD now enrolls about 2,300 students and owns more than 30 buildings, mostly restored 19th-century structures, in Savannah's historic, moss-draped downtown. "I would hate to think what downtown Savannah would be without SCAD." said Lee Adler, the leader of Savannah's historic-preservation movement.
But a growing number of past and present students, employees, teachers, administrators and trustees say the college's mission has more to do with money and power than with education.
 
A Family Affair
 In dozens of interviews, these critics depict a tax-exempt institution that operates like a family business, routinely provides false information to prospective students and has subordinated educational needs to economic ones.
"SCAD is becoming a pariah institution," Russell Barclay, the former head of the liberal arts department, wrote trustees in May. In an interview, he added, "There's no end to the people who would love to have this kind of a deal: a tax-exempt family with a tuition-driven life style."
SCAD, an accredited four-year college of art and architecture, is a highly unusual academic institution. Professors don't have tenure and are on one-year contracts. They are expected to raise money, generate favorable publicity and recruit students as well as teach.
The president is Richard Rowan, a former Georgia Department of Education administrator with the demeanor of a high-powered salesman. The provost is his wife, Paula Rowan, a former teacher in Atlanta. The vice president for admissions is Mrs. Rowan's mother, May Poetter; the comptroller is her father, Paul Poetter. A school spokesman and editor of the administration-run newspaper is Mrs. Rowan's sister, Pamela Afifi. An architecture professor is Mrs. Afifi's husband, Emad Afifi.
Teachers, students and even former trustees say the Rowans run the school without any real oversight. There is no student government or student newspaper, and a fledgling faculty senate began only after the turmoil of the past year. The college's paid general counsel, Hugh Dorsey 3d, who founded the institution along with Mr. Rowan, is also the head of its trustees.
"I don't think I ever voted on one thing," said Pat Conroy, the novelist, who spent two years on the board and then resigned, worried that there was no oversight to the Rowans' willy-nilly expansion. "It was one of the most bewildering things I've ever been a part of. I left the board because I was afraid that if I stayed on it I would end up in jail."
 
It Started in an Armory
 SCAD's story started in 1978, when the Rowans, neither of whom had a doctorate or a career centered on art, moved to Savannah with the idea of starting an art college. They had considered various kinds of colleges before deciding that the lack of art schools in the Southeast and the rich stock of unused buildings in Savannah's historic downtown made the city a perfect site.
By their own account in the administration newspaper, The Georgia Guardian, they began small, selling their home in Atlanta and trading in their car for a Volkswagen. They bought an abandoned armory, and after doing much of the renovation on their own, attracted 71 students for the college's first year in 1979.
Borrowing aggressively, buying everything from 19th-century buildings for offices and classrooms to an Art Deco diner for a campus eatery, they made the college perhaps the most active real estate player in downtown Savannah. And they gained an reputation for playing hardball with their own employees and with others.
For example, a former professor, Murray Wilson, and a former student, Mickey Youmans, said Mr. Rowan had them use a concealed microphone to bug and tape-record an accrediting team from the Georgia Department of Education visiting the college in 1986. In an interview, Mrs. Rowan denied that such an incident had taken place.
As the college has grown, the Rowans have prospered. They now drive a Mercedes, raise rare Arabian horses and travel extensively on school business, dining at restaurants like Le Cirque in New York and staying at hotels like the Ritz in London. College officials refuse to say how much the Rowans earn, but the college's annual statement to the Internal Revenue Service, required for its tax exemption as a not-for-profit educational institution, says the two together made $358,000 in salary in 1991.
 
Economics and Academics
 In the interview, Mrs. Rowan said much of the conflict surrounding the school stemmed from its innovative policies and its rapid growth in the middle of stodgy Savannah.
"Suddenly things have turned from where some of these people might say, 'Well, you're in our neighborhood,' to realizing that they are in our neighborhood," Mrs. Rowan said. "And I think that has an unsettling effect on some people who would prefer the status quo."
But to critics, the college has become an economic enterprise first and an academic one second, in which everything is driven by a need to attract enough students to pay the bills.
As some faculty members wrote in a recent memorandum to accrediting bodies: "In its bizarre and chaotic organization, in its deceptive admission practices, in its neglect of basic academic resources in favor of showy trappings which which to entice prospective students . . . and especially in the cynical subordination of academic needs to financial concerns in the development and oversight of its academic programs, SCAD has shown a wholesale disregard for the values of American higher education."
In a lawsuit against the college that has not yet come to trial, four students allege that SCAD misrepresents itself to prospective students -- offering facilities that don't exist, making false claims about career placement of graduates and making excessive claims for its degree programs. Mr. Dorsey, the counsel who is also head of the trustees, says the lawsuit is groundless.
In interviews, several former recruiters said they were paid a fee for each student who enrolled. The National Association of College Admission Counselors, of which SCAD is a member, says it expressly forbids that practice. Mrs. Afifi said admissions personnel, like other employees, received a base salary plus periodic bonuses and raises based on merit.
Statistics provided by the college in recent editions of Peterson's College Guide say 45 percent of applicants are accepted. Recruiters say they are told to report average Scholastic Aptitude Test scores around 1,000.
But students, teachers and four former recruiters, in separate interviews, say that virtually anyone who can pay is accepted and that the average S.A.T. score is around 850, with many hundreds of points below that. Mrs. Rowan says the college stands by its figures.
 
Elegant but Empty
 Past and present employees say even basic information on enrollment has been routinely inflated over the years to burnish the institution's image.
The catalogue distributed last year describes the home of the video school as follows: "Among the spaces within the richly ornamented Romanesque-style facade are classrooms, equipment rooms, editing suites, and a 36,000-square-foot sound stage which can be adapted to multiple uses."
The building is an unoccupied shell.
Many students say the college provides an excellent education despite its problems. "The facilities and the faculty are just great," said Alan Bucknam, a photography student. "It's the administration that's just a little screwed up."
But others say they didn't get what they paid for, and several this summer said the college balked at sending out their transcripts when they tried to transfer.
Marissa Magaz, a former graduate student who is one of those suing SCAD, said she gave up a job as head of the fine arts program at a school in Miami to come to Savannah, only to decide that SCAD's unusual degree of master of fine arts in art history was useless in pursuing the doctorate she was seeking. One of her former professors, Jim Rogers, who has since left SCAD, terms it "a bogus degree oriented toward getting as many bodies and keeping as many fees as possible."
The administration's supporters say the problems this year reflect the discontent of a few faculty members. "I see a great future for the college, and I want to be a part of it," said Judith Van Baron, recently named vice president for academic affairs.
But critics say the college is better at marketing and sales than education. "I'd jump in a minute, but most of my credits won't transfer," said Katie Steinwart, who said she hadn't planned to apply to SCAD but enrolled after being offered a $10,000 scholarship, which starts at $1,000 a year and adds $1,000 a year until it's worth $4,000 if a student stays in school as a senior. "Once you're in, they've got you. The whole school is a scam."
 
A Tumultuous Year
 The administration's resistance to a proposed student constitution in the spring set in motion a tumultuous series of events that brought many of the questions about the school into the open. Administration officials, citing a small explosive device found near an administration building on April 6, tried to stop leaders of the student movement from enrolling unless they signed legal documents prepared by the college. A second pipe bomb forced the cancellation of graduation.
Since then, organizations like as the American Association of University Professors and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools have said they plan to investigate the school this year. In the most severe blow thus far, the National Architectural Accrediting Board, which accredits the nation's schools of architecture, put SCAD on probation, forcing it to meet its standards or lose accreditation in 1993.
Three trustees critical of the administration were immediately replaced by the board. Convinced that the college is dependent on an unsustainable rate of growth, some former faculty members and trustees are trying to lure a competing art college to Savannah. The School of Visual Arts in New York has expressed an interest in a possible branch here.
Mr. Dorsey, the head of the trustees, said the college would once again enroll the largest freshman class in its history. But about two dozen faculty members, or more than 20 percent of those who began last year at the college, were either not given new contracts or chose not to return. Over the past year the college lost the two top academic administrators under Mrs. Rowan -- one was dismissed and the other resigned -- as well as four vice presidents and several deans.
The college faces continuing financial pressures and has cut back on its construction and maintenance staff at a time when its 1991 financial statement says $4.5 million in mortgages are coming due between 1992 and 1996. A year ago, the college told the Federal Department of Education that it was scheduling a bond issue. But it has not yet issued any new bonds.
Even the harshest critics say that the Rowans pulled off a miracle in building a college that still has extraordinary potential, and that downtown Savannah desperately needs such an institution. But many now fear the entrepreneurial dazzle that built SCAD is killing it.
"There's nothing wrong with running a college in a businesslike fashion," said Harry Dixon, who was dismissed as academic dean this year after raising questions about the Rowans' management. "But when the business is the bottom line rather than the education, when respect for students and faculty goes out the window, then you've got a real problem. When I started here I think SCAD was about education. I don't think it's about education anymore. It's about building an empire."

HEADLINE: Small Farms Cultivate Way of Life, and Profit

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
The family farm, that white clapboard idyll where Mom cooks in a ruffled apron and Pop works in bib overalls, has for decades been lodged more firmly in the American heart than in the nation's countryside. In the last 30 years the number of farms in the United States has dropped by half, to just over two million.
But as the number of traditional farms dwindles, a new type of farm -- and a new type of farmer -- is sprouting up across America: modest plots tended by savvy, part-time farmers who plow, weed and water as much to cultivate a way of living as to grow profitable crops. 
 "County extension agents and farm-market managers across the country are all seeing a steady infusion of highly educated, part-time farmers sprouting up on the fringes of major cities," said Howard W. (Bud) Kerr, director of the Office for Small Scale Agriculture in the United States Department of Agriculture, which tracks small farmers and publishes a free newsletter for them. "They farm for pleasure and profit, and for the quality of life that it offers."
The tailored lawyer who grows mache lettuce on the weekend, the Southeast Asian immigrant whose day job with a state health department supports his snow-pea patch at home, the Nike-clad math teacher who tends bees after school, the retired steelworker who earns most of his income from an acre of organic herbs -- these contemporary farmers are far from the American Gothic portrait that politicians summon when they extol "the American way of life."
These new-style agriculturalists are rapidly becoming keepers of the mythic American farm.
A study released in July by the Agriculture Department's National Agricultural Statistics Service showed that while the number of large farms -- the average size is now 468 acres -- continued to decline in 1991, the number of small farms with annual sales of $1,000 to $9,999 increased by 3,000, to 1.006 million farms this year from 1.003 million in 1991. But officials say that while the increase is significant because of the continuing drop in other areas of agriculture, it still only hints at the growth of small farms.
Agricultural experts say that the reported income of small farms represents a fraction of the money actually earned by small-scale farmers who sell directly to the public. The experts say that "exurban micro farming" is even more widespread than Government data indicate.
"There is no question that part-time farmers are proliferating," said Karl Ohm, publisher of Rural Enterprise, a quarterly trade magazine for fruit and vegetable growers that is published in Menominee Falls, Wis. Mr. Ohm, like many experts, feels that a confluence of economic and social forces is changing who farms in America and what they farm.
 
Vulnerable Large Farms
 Since World War II, American farms have generally grown to industrial size and become heavily dependent on fuel-intensive equipment, petroleum-based pesticides and fertilizers and large-scale bank financing. When oil prices and finance costs began rising in the late 1970's, large farms were vulnerable. Smaller farms were not as heavily shackled with such overhead and could also respond more quickly to urban-centered, carriage-trade markets demanding specialty produce.
At the same time, Mr. Kerr said, zoning regulations around many major metropolitan areas increasingly forbid the division of small parcels of land. "So basically you have a new generation of gentry," he said. "Zoning makes them buy a five-acre parcel and they aren't sitting in their new house too long before they realize that they can either mow a lot of grass or put in some goats or some row crops."
In addition, Mr. Kerr said, local tax laws sometimes favor agricultural use of land. And for retirees and less wealthy families, he said, turning a profit from the backyard is a way of supplementing income.
 
Cornerstone of Direct Sales
 "It's been a quiet revolution over the past decade," Mr. Ohm said, adding that direct marketing from roadside stands and urban farmers' markets is its cornerstone.
Dr. Donald Albrecht, an associate professor of rural sociology at Texas A & M University who helped analyze the data, points out that the growth of small urban farms means little in terms of the national food supply. "Seventy-five percent of the nation's food still comes from 3 percent of its largest farms," he said.
But sociologically, Dr. Albrecht said, the shift in farm population patterns is significant. "We're looking at a whole new image of the American farmer," he said.
Bernie Brand, a 58-year-old junior high school mathematics teacher and beekeeper in Shoreview, Minn., near Minneapolis, is hardly a portrait of the traditional American farmer.
But he turned his beekeeping hobby into a business for two reasons: to make extra money and to give his two sons a quality of life otherwise lacking in the suburbs. Seventeen years later, he has saved about $20,000 toward his sons' college education. "More importantly, my 14-year-old and 17-year-old don't spend their summers roaming the mall," he said. "They work the bees, extract honey and help sell it at the farmers' market."
His wife, Patty Brand, the manager of the St. Paul Farmers' Markets, said her family mirrors a trend. "It's getting harder and harder for a farm to be the sole support of a family," she said. "We lose about 10 old-time growers a year, and usually they are replaced by people like us, part-time farmers with children and full-time professional lives."
 
Labor-intensive and Profitable
 Generally, Mrs. Brand said, part-time farmers in her area begin with specialty products like herbs, honey or organic produce. Around the country, first-generation immigrant farmers also rely on specialty produce. That trend, which began nearly two decades ago with growing herbs, exotic lettuces and miniature vegetables for restaurants, has grown from a boutique activity to the mainstay of many small family farms, said Pedro Ilic, a farm adviser with the University of California Extension Service in Southern California.
"It's labor-intensive farming that doesn't require a big cash outlay for overhead," Mr. Ilic said. Since 1980, he said, 845 Mexican-American, Southeast Asian and Chinese families have been able to make livings on Fresno County plots averaging 3.3 acres.
Besides profiting from the labor that is often available in large, extended families, immigrant small farmers choose to work the land for the quality of life it offers.
"I can make as much extra money as I need working as a translator," said Chue Vang, a trilingual Laotian who immigrated to Missoula, Mont., in 1979 and works for the State Department of Health there. "But on five acres I can make that money growing long Asian green beans, snow peas and chives, and my son doesn't go with the gangs. He works with me. He gets straight A's and he goes to Outward Bound."
 
Now It's Amber Waves of Herbs
 Mr. Kerr of the Office for Small Scale Agriculture says that, besides young professionals, he has also noted a steady increase in retirees who turn gardening hobbies into sources of income. Leroy Wilton, a 53-year-old retired steelworker in Pasadena, Md., for instance, raised herbs for many of the 26 years he worked at Armco Steel. After being forced into early retirement last year, he said, he built a greenhouse on his one-acre lot and turned his hobby into a year-round source of income.
"My only regret is not doing it sooner," Mr. Wilton said. "I wish I could have given my own kids what I'm giving my grandchildren, working with them on the herbs. The country's falling apart, and this is a way to keep families together."
One- , three- and five-acre plots are far from the amber waves of grain that rustle in the American Dream. The suburban hobby or fun farm that becomes a family's profit center will do little to stem the decline of a far-flung rural culture. And agricultural experts like J. Tevere MacFadyen, author of "Gaining Ground," a study of small farms in America that was published by Holt, Rinehart & Winston in 1984, are quick to point out that the rising breed of small family farms thrives because the society has elevated certain commodities, like herbs and organic produce, into discretionary purchases. But they worry that these farmers are vulnerable to changes in the economy and the fashions of the table.
 
Elbow Room on the Nonfarm
 Dr. John Fraser Hart, who has studied farm life and population patterns as a professor of geography at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, and who wrote "The Land that Feeds Us" (W. W. Norton, 1991), said the new small farmers are tapping another fundamental American characteristic. "They're looking for elbow room, freedom, self-determination," said Dr. Hart, who has just completed a survey of farms along a major highway near Minneapolis and St. Paul.
"Thirty years ago that highway was all large farms," he said. "Today over half are what we've traditionally called 'nonfarms,' places so small they aren't normally tracked by the census. I couldn't find a farmer at home between 9 and 5, because every one of them works full-time jobs in the city. But on the weekends there they were, out in the field with their kids, the happiest, most solid families you can imagine.
"Well, we don't have the right words for any of this yet, I mean, data-wise. But as far as life style goes, what we're seeing is little patches of Americana, that sort of dream that won't die."

HEADLINE: Bias Beating And a Death Shock a City

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CORAL SPRINGS, Fla., Aug. 21

 BODY:
Last weekend in this small Southeast Florida city, a 19-year-old pre-medical student who came to this country as a child with his parents from Vietnam, was fatally beaten by a group of young white men after he objected to a racial slur one of them used.
The student, Luyen Phan Nguyen, of Coral Springs, died Monday. The Broward County Medical Examiner said the fatal blow was a kick behind an ear that fractured a neck bone and severed arteries. 
 On Wednesday, with newspapers and television stations reporting each development, the police began arresting young men they said were tied to the beating.
On Thursday, 175 friends and family members held a Buddhist ceremony for Mr. Nguyen, and some prayed near where he was beaten. Afterward, the county's small Asian community pleaded for justice.
Former classmates at Coral Springs High School said Mr. Nguyen was popular and an excellent student. He was on the school math team, ran track and was in the environmental club. He would have been a sophomore this fall at the University of Miami.
 
Lingering Unease for Residents
 With the arrests and the family's anguish receiving wide publicity, residents said it would take a long time to recover from the kind of violence and bias that were virtually unknown in their upper-middle-class city of 85,000 people.
"This is Coral Springs, a family neighborhood," said Yazid Ali, who moved here a year ago from Jamaica, Queens, with his wife and young son. "In this neighborhood, you can't fix your car in the street. You get a ticket for that. You can't have a sign advertising your business on your car. There are so many rules. I can't understand how this could happen."
The incident began late Saturday at a party attended by Mr. Nguyen and the young men in the apartment complex where Mr. Ali lives. Someone made a derogatory remark about Mr. Nguyen's nationality. He protested and left, witnesses told the police. They said several young men followed Mr. Nguyen out the door.
"It started off with some young guy wanting to be a tough guy, and everybody just got involved," said a police investigator, James P. Milford. "They chased him down like a hunter chases down an injured deer."
Mr. Ali said he heard cursing and "drunk talk" around 11 P.M. in a grassy area between buildings. He went to his balcony and saw 15 to 20 people, some of them hitting someone on the ground.
"I yelled, 'Let him up, let him up!' " Mr. Ali said. "They were really beating up this kid."
 
8 Arrested in Beating
 A neighbor telephoned the police as the beating continued and after a few minutes, Mr. Ali said, it stopped. Witnesses said the attackers got into cars and left as residents tried to help Mr. Nguyen, who appeared to have stopped breathing. Paramedics arrived and took him to a Fort Lauderdale hospital, where officials said he was on a life-support system until he died.
By Friday, the police had arrested eight men in the case, 18 to 22 years old, and charged them with second-degree murder.
Coral Springs's police chief, Roy A. Arigo, said that some of the suspects had minor criminal records but that most were middle-class working men with no record of trouble. One had just returned home after completing Marine boot camp at Camp Lejeune, N.C., and one said he was unemployed. The others said they worked at resorts, automobile dealerships and other businesses.
Rights groups issued pleas for tolerance, saying they feared the incident might be an indication that bias was on the rise here. The state authorities said 43 bias crimes were reported in Broward County in 1991, none involving Asians.
Like Mr. Ali, many Coral Springs residents seemed to fear that the kind of violence they fled in other parts of the country and that they associate with other parts of Southeast Florida seemed to be gaining in the city.
Coral Springs's Mayor, Jeanne Mills, blamed a "party out of control," where "everyone was under some kind of influence."
Chief Arigo said: "Coral Springs enjoys a very low crime rate. In fact, the crime rate is the lowest for a city of our size in Southeast Florida, but this just goes to show you that no matter where you live, violence is part of society."

White, Male, Middle-Aged And Wavering

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

DATELINE: RIDGEWOOD, N.J.

 BODY:
Every Tuesday afternoon, about 100 business executives gather at the Knights of Columbus hall in this prosperous suburb. The group is middle-aged, all white, virtually all men ("A few ladies," says Steven Salaway), with impressive resumes -- vice presidents, division managers, systems analysts. Most are in the $70,000 to $120,000 salary range.
As a group they are not political, but individually, they tend to vote Republican. These are the out-of-work Republicans. It is why they meet, to share job leads. Some, like Mr. Salaway (bank vice president, $86,000) have been out two years. Many Americans who voted for President Bush in 1988 are now jobless. Unemployment is 9.8 percent in New Jersey, (a 10-year high); 9.4 in Michigan; 8.9 in California; 8.6 in Florida, all states that went for Mr. Bush. 
 While Republicans in Houston cheered family values, these people fretted over house payments and health insurance. Many would not give their names because they now call themselves consultants and don't want employers knowing it's a fancy title for jobless. Mr. Salaway has been set back 10 years financially. When William Graham visited his son at camp, the 11-year-old asked, "Dad, you found a job?" The father said, "Not yet." And the boy asked, "Dad, we in the poorhouse yet?"
To businessmen like these, perhaps the single most surreal moment of the Republican convention -- even more surreal than Marilyn Quayle bashing draft dodgers -- was the Secretary of Labor saying, "Are we better off than four years ago? Of course we are!"
The men at the Knights hall (they use it free) are not dinosaurs, not steelworkers or coal miners. They are management information systems specialists, fellows who know how to maximize performance from a computer system. If the economy were growing, they'd be in the thick of it. Most have been laid off during "downsizing" -- the lopping off of entire corporate divisions. Nothing personal. As their job searches stretch on, they view the economy as a downward spiral of shrinking companies going through round after round of layoffs to stay solvent.
Inflation's upward spiral helped unseat a President in 1980 and these people have that spiraling feeling again. "I'm diehard Republican," said Mr. Salaway. "I almost voted for a Democrat once -- I can't remember who." If the election were tomorrow, he said that he could not vote for Mr. Bush and that he had several Republican friends who felt the same. "Bush pretended the economy was fine too long."
"I'm definitely not voting for Bush," said Ted Sogrotzki, another longtime Reagan-Bush man. He came to the meeting like he used to dress for work, in gray suit and carrying a brief case. He's "90 percent sure" he'll vote for Bill Clinton. He found nothing new in the President's speech of a lifetime.
The economy is moving them. Walter Mazuryk voted for Mr. Bush in '88; he's moved to undecided. "I'm afraid to vote for a Democrat but I'm left with no choice." Alex Diamant couldn't get enthusiastic about anyone in '88 and didn't vote; he's moved to Mr. Clinton.
They care about family values, but few look to politicians for them. It is partly that the press has ballyhooed Gennifer and Jennifer to the point that they seem to cancel each other out. But beyond that, does anyone believe a national politician has made family a top priority? "For national businessmen and politicians, family is secondary," said Allan Karan. "Work is primary." Who spends more time raising their children, unwed mothers or the Vice President of the United States? "Family values is a smokescreen to hide the economy," says Mr. Mazuryk.
Weekly meetings are so impressive, they're painful to watch. Most participants arrive 15 minutes early. They bring job leads that didn't work for them, but may help others. Six new members introduced themselves; three had been vice presidents. They sat in rows of 10 so job leads could be efficiently distributed and collated. Free computer courses were announced in subjects like AS400/RPG3. A speaker lectured on interviewing techniques, and they took notes. They make you realize how much work unemployment is.
Each week they survey themselves. "I'd like a count of how many had interviews this week for a real job, not a recruiter or agency?" Sixteen. "How many went on a second interview?" Five. "How many offers?" Zero.
"It's scary how fast we're growing," said Mr. Mazuryk. "Each month we get 20 to 30 new members and maybe six people find a job." Afterward, they raced off. Jim Matulevich, a systems manager, had to get to a $5-an-hour liquor store job. Many will stay with Mr. Bush, but a lot are ready to hold their noses and vote Democrat and this looks to be an election that will be decided by the nose-holders.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
'Thunder' Rumbles In Travers

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., Aug. 22

 BODY:
Thunder Rumble, who delivered a rousing upset three weeks ago when he won the Jim Dandy Stakes at odds of 25-1, delivered just as rousing an encore today when he won the $1 million Travers Stakes by four and a half lengths and shot to the head of the class of 3-year-old colts.
He not only outran Devil His Due and Dance Floor, but all three of them outran the speed demons in the field of 10: Dixie Brass, who led into the homestretch but faded to finish fourth; Furiously, who won his first three races by 31 lengths but ran sixth in the big one, and Alydeed, the Canadian superstar and the favorite today, who stalked the leader for one mile but retreated in the stretch and finished eighth. 
 In the end, racing's celebrated house of upsets lived up to its billing in the 123d running of the Travers before a crowd of 46,372 spectators that thronged the old track in the countryside.
Here was a horse who didn't run in any of the Triple Crown races last spring, who was scratched from the Wood Memorial on the morning of the race with a virus infection, who ran once between the middle of March and the beginning of the Saratoga season, finishing seventh in an allowance race. Even when he won the Jim Dandy and paid $51.80 to anybody smart enough or bold enough to bet $2 on him, people didn't take him seriously.
In the Travers, running against all that speed, he drew the No. 10 post position on the far outside, and he was the fifth choice in the betting at 7-1. And, if all that weren't enough, he was the only horse in the field who was bred in New York State, which hadn't produced a winner of the Travers in this century.
"But I don't tell him he's a New York bred," said Richie O'Connell, who trains Thunder Rumble for Konrad Widmer, an economist from Switzerland who had never seen him win a race.
 
Some Nervous Moments
 Well, Widmer saw him win one today. But as he watched with his trainer, their underdog seemed to be moving from one trap to another.
"I was horrified," O'Connell said later. "He went wide at the first turn. He was frequently in a box. He went wide again on the far turn."
"And, after all that," he said, "he wins drawing off. I'm impressed."
He had a right to be impressed. Three weeks ago, Thunder Rumble won the Jim Dandy at a mile and one-eighth in 1:472/5 , the fastest time in 29 years. Today, he won the Travers at a mile and a quarter in 2:004/5 , delivering the third best time in the history of the race and matching the time set by the renowned Easy Goer three years ago.
Herb McCauley, who has ridden Thunder Rumble in all five victories in his seven starts this year, was impressed, too.
"When the horse broke out of the gate," McCauley said, "I saw Dixie Brass shooting for the lead on the fence. He was obviously the speed. I elected to take my horse back and not swing too wide too early. I didn't know if it would work. I didn't know if he would fire when they got down to serious running."
 
Dixie Whistles
 Most of the serious running was being done by Dixie Brass, who shot the first quarter-mile in 23 seconds and did three-quarters in 1:103/5 . As expected, he was being chased by Alydeed, briefly by Furiously and finally by Thunder Rumble, who made his move with a quarter-mile to go.
"When I let him out between the three-eighths and the quarter pole," McCauley said, "I had a ton of horse."
At the close, the ton of horse had four and a half lengths on Allen Jerkens's Devil His Due, who ran third in the Jim Dandy, and he in turn had four and a half lengths on Dance Floor, who is owned by the rap star Hammer and who had run ninth and last in his last two races.
The winner rewarded his partisans with $17.20 for every $2 bet, and rewarded his stable with $600,000.
Dixie Brass? His trainer, Dennis Brida, put it simply: "He got tired." Then he added: "He hung as tough as he could. Maybe the mile and a quarter is beyond his scope."
Alydeed? His rider, Craig Perret, reported: "I didn't want to go to the lead too soon. But when I asked him to pick it up, he didn't accelerate. I smacked him once, and he didn't give me anything."
Furiously? His rider, Mike Smith, said with regret: "I had it clear down the backstretch. but then I look, and here comes that Thunder Rumble. He flew right by me."

 
 
FINISH LINE
 Alydeed, who has been running on the medication Lasix to control pulmonary bleeding, was examined after the race but no sign of bleeding was found. . . . The weather was clear, the track was fast and the crowd was betting: $6,529,085 was wagered at the track, a record for Saratoga. The total handle at home and away reached $15,777,166. . . . PAT DAY rode the winners of the first four races, but then his streak was broken. In the Travers, he ran ninth aboard the long shot Hold Old Blue. Then he ran eighth on Devil On Ice in the $122,400 King's Bishop Stakes, which was won by D. WAYNE LUKAS'S Salt Lake, who outran the favored Binalong by three lengths with NICK ZITO'S Agincourt next. Salt Lake raced the seven furlongs in 1:212/5 and paid $19 for $2 to win.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL;
3 Find Reality Is Part of the Game

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN

 BODY:
They did not plan to be spectators on Saturday afternoons. After all the letters and phone calls from college football coaches, the visits and decisions, this much seemed clear: Michael Miller, Bryan Fortay and Robert Smith each possessed the gifts to make a difference in a sport that turns nearly all the others into witnesses.
As the structure of college football continues to evolve, with a coalition of bowl games attempting to reshape the sport's decisive moments and with severe economic and pressures threatening further change, there is one factor that has remained constant since the days of the flying wedge. At the highest level, on the most memorable Saturdays, the history of the game is often determined by the remarkable accomplishments of great players. 
 "Ninety-five percent of your athletes have to be good enough not to get you beat, not to lose a game for you," said John Cooper, the Ohio State coach. "But you better have somebody who is going to win the game for you."
Miller, Fortay and Smith still fit that description, even after a difficult season of inactivity in which their careers took sudden detours. In a period of several weeks late last summer, circumstances turned each of them into spectators. The circumstances illustrated the competitive and academic pressures of Division I-A football; the players' return represents an acknowledgement that they had little choice but to come to terms with the system.
Miller, who had been advertised as the next Rocket Ismail before he graduated from Willowridge High School in Sugarland, Tex., left Notre Dame to return home after 31 seconds of playing time, citing the frustration of being injured and the pressures created by Ismail's accomplishments. He returned in January after realizing he had made a mistake and starts his sophomore year at the school in September.
Also a year ago, Fortay, who lost the competition to Gino Torretta for the starting quarterback spot at Miami, was driving north to New Jersey, to transfer to Rutgers, before the 1991 season started.
And Smith, a tailback who had gained 1,147 yards as the Big Ten freshman of the year at Ohio State in 1990, left the team -- but not the school -- last August. Smith's charge that an atmosphere emphasizing athletics over academics was in conflict with his responsibility as a pre-medical student made him a national symbol for academic neglect in athletic departments.
Once the college choices of the three were made, their status as prize recruits had not shielded them from the realities of their business. An injury, or a coach's decision, or an assistant coach's approach, or a breakdown in communication, contributed to problems that had to be addressed.
"To them," Smith said of coaches, "it's a job. To me, it's a way to pay for school. That's a very big conflict."
When their situations became unbearable last season, the only way out was to get out.
"It really wasn't hard at all," Miller said. "One day I woke up. 'Hey, it's time to go.' Things weren't going the way I thought they go. I was disappointed, hurt. I just up and left. I didn't really think. I just did it."
Miller played in one game, at Michigan, returning one punt for 5 yards and three kickoffs for 19. The previous time Notre Dame had played at Michigan, in 1989, Rocket Ismail had returned kickoffs for touchdowns of 92 and 89 yards. Ismail was a sophomore that season, and healthy, and he had been able to develop a knowledge of the system. Miller was an injured freshman standing in the place of a departed legend.
"He looks like Rocket," Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz said in February 1991. "He talks like Rocket. His facial expressions are like Rocket. He's not quite as tall as Rocket, but he's got the same bubbly personality. They tell me he's slightly faster than Rocket. He's very good at kickoff returns and punt returns, and he's more advanced as a wide receiver than Rocket at this stage."
Holtz also said this: "We do not expect him to be another Rocket."
It was too late. The coach's detailed comparisons had already chiseled the expectation into stone.
The coach had omitted one important similarity. Miller has the ability to run 40 yards in 4.35 seconds, but he would rather not be a focal point off the field.
"Another guy on the team," Miller said. "That's the way I prefer it."
A year ago, Miller's speed and potential transformed the 5-foot-7-inch, 155-pound freshman into the college equivalent of a No. 1 draft choice. A summer injury made the expectations unreachable.
"A few guys back home were just in the weight room," Miller remembered. "I was never really a big lifter in high school. It was like, 'Hey, I wonder how much you can squat.' I never squatted in high school. I was like, 'Well, let's see.' "
Miller lifted about 300 pounds, and felt his legs were tired when he ran afterward. He first thought the discomfort was just a cramp, and did not see a doctor for more than a week. But the fatigue turned out to be a severe hamstring pull.
His injury created a cycle that would soon cause him to leave. Missed practice time caused him to fall behind, and his painful hamstring prevented him from catching up. Miller was gone the Monday after the Michigan game, and was soon enrolled as a non-scholarship student at the University of Houston.
"I wouldn't like to see anyone else go through anything like that again," Miller said. "Anyone."
Fortay's problems also began before he left high school. His 4,100 passing yards at East Brunswick High School in New Jersey made him a target of the elite. Fortay listened as Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson and assistant Gary Stevens placed him in the impressive line of Hurricane quarterbacks.
Craig Erickson, the successor to Steve Walsh, had two years left, which would leave Fortay as the starter as a third-year sophomore in 1991.
"I heard Lou Holtz say you should not choose a school for a coach," Fortay said. "But with all other things being equal, why do you choose a school? A guy you feel comfortable with for the next five years, four hours a day, every day. You've got to feel comfortable with him."
Fortay made his commitment before Christmas of 1988. By early March, everything had changed. Johnson had left to coach the Dallas Cowboys, and was replaced by Dennis Erickson of Washington State.
"So here I go from a coach I feel really comfortable with to somebody I've never even spoken to on the phone," Fortay said. "And this is after nine months of perpetual call after call, after letter after letter, to the point where I'm hiding from people. And all of a sudden I've got a coach I've never even talked to. Something is wrong there."
The letter of intent binds the athlete to the school, but a coach's contract does not prevent a sudden departure. Fortay was on the Miami roster as a backup in 1989, and sat out in 1990. A year ago, just over a week before the season, Miami announced its starting quarterback. Erickson acknowledged that Fortay had better statistics in scrimmages, but said he chose Gino Torretta because of the experience. Within days, Fortay was driving north.
Robert Smith's situation did not take him anywhere. He was even in Ohio Stadium for three games last fall, using his evasive tactics. He was just evading a different group of people.
"Just basically scooting in and out," he said. "Getting the head down low a little bit. Getting the hat on, the glasses. I wasn't really seen too much during the games."
Smith's dispute with former assistant coach Elliot Uzelac -- a conflict Smith described as one of ideologies, not personalities -- put a face on the issue of time demands faced by major-college athletes.
"I want exactly what Robert is talking about," said John Cooper, the Ohio State coach. "All we had to do is communicate. If Robert Smith had come to me and said: 'Coach, I have a problem. There's a conflict. What should I do?' Boom -- go to class. It could have been avoided. It should have been avoided."
A year later, Smith has returned to the team, but an edge in his voice brings a reminder of the emotion of the time. "Saying that I caused the controversy is like saying that law causes crime," Smith said.
The controversy was especially intense with the backdrop of all those loyal thousands in scarlet and gray. "If the whole world was against me, I still would have done what I did," Smith said.
Smith considered leaving for Stanford or Southern California, but chose to stay because leaving would have disrupted his academic schedule and forced him to miss another season. The restrictions on athletes who transfer were also a consideration for Miller and Fortay.
Miller was able to return to Notre Dame because he had not gone to Houston as a scholarship student. Fortay, by rushing to enroll at Rutgers before 1991 classes started, became eligible to play this season. Smith remains on schedule to graduate with his class in 1994, and has three more seasons of eligibility.
"I feel a lot more comfortable with Coach Cooper and the coaching staff now, that they are more dedicated to us as students as well as athletes," Smith said.
"I think I'm different mentally. I've put college football into a more clear perspective in my life. I see it as a means to an end even more now. I always did, but I do realize I need to play. How long that is in the future I really don't know."
The fall quarter at Ohio State was weeks away, and for most of the day, Smith was nothing but a football player. Inside Ohio Stadium, workers were reassembling the huge bleachers that fill in the south end of the gray horseshoe and expand its capacity to 91,470. And not far away, on the practice fields outside the massive, $10.6 million Woody Hayes Athletic Center, the Buckeyes were working to meet the standard expectations of all those thousands in scarlet and gray.
As the sun began to set and Smith and his teammates sprinted at the end of their day of work, it seemed as if nothing had changed. There was still a job to be won, a system to be mastered, and a coach to be satisfied.
"It's not my job to keep them happy," Cooper said with a smile. "It's their job to keep me happy. That's the way I look at it."

HEADLINE: Houston's Two Conventions

 BODY:
There were actually two Republican conventions in Houston, not one. The first, aimed at softening up the Democrats while firming up Mr. Bush's right wing, consisted of numbingly repetitive attacks on Congress and coarse slurs about the Clintons. It seemed to go on forever.
The second convention lasted almost an hour: Mr. Bush's acceptance speech. Here, at last, real issues like foreign affairs and the recession were engaged. Mr. Bush mentioned "family values" only once and left Bill and Hillary Clinton's personal life alone. He wasn't mean. Hard-edged, but not mean. 
 Things were choreographed this way, of course -- Bad Cop followed by Good Cop. But the Bad Cops went far beyond the normal bashing expected in politics. Directly or by innuendo, they were often divisive and occasionally savage.
Pat Buchanan derided the Democrats as "pro-lesbian and pro-gay." He spoke movingly of unemployed whites in New Hampshire ("our people") but described Los Angeles's angry blacks as the "mob." Dan Lungren, California's Attorney General, went Mr. Buchanan one better in the whites-are-victims, blacks-are-victimizers game, rehearsing at length the Willie Horton case and applauding the 1988 ads.
Pat Robertson warned that Mr. Clinton would appoint homosexuals to key posts; William Bennett inveighed against "rampant promiscuity." And even Marilyn Quayle, a sort of honorary Bad Cop, got in a few licks by reminding her listeners that not all baby boomers "dropped out, took drugs, joined in the sexual revolution, or dodged the draft."
Abortion, raging feminists and homosexuality seem to be this year's version of the distractions Mr. Bush offered four years ago: school prayer, the Pledge of Allegiance, flag burning. But by Thursday morning, the litany had tired all but the most evangelical Republicans.
Some delegates saw the whole question of "family values" less in terms of cultural issues like abortion and more in terms of economic issues like family leave and day care. Others didn't want to talk about family values at all. "I came down thinking about the economy," said Joan Rader, a Connecticut delegate.
The economy was, in fact, the central political issue for Republicans on their way into Houston and the central political issue on their way out. Mr. Bush spoke at length, and with justifiable pride, of his achievements in foreign policy. He spent many tedious minutes bashing Congress, the weakest part of a speech that seems to have had too many writers and too few editors.
Then he turned to the economy, made sweeping promises, and provided few details.
The centerpiece of his economic program is an unspecified across-the-board tax cut matched by unspecified spending cuts. The only new wrinkle was a proposal to allow taxpayers to dedicate up to 10 percent of their Federal taxes for deficit reduction, with a dollar-for-dollar reduction in Federal spending.
The program makes no economic sense. For starters, it won't jump start a laggard economy. The spending cuts will offset the tax cuts, leaving the net impact on the economy close to zero. Nor does the program address the 20-year slowdown in productivity. Untargeted tax cuts won't channel investment into new equipment or worker training, the engines of economic growth.
Mr. Bush promised more than he could possibly deliver. Neither he nor Congress has summoned the courage to propose enough spending cuts to balance even the current budget, let alone a budget thrown further into the red by a tax cut. Mr. Bush would save money by capping entitlement programs. But he apparently won't touch Social Security and veterans' benefits; to save hundreds of billions a year from what's left, he'd have to virtually eliminate Medicare and Medicaid.
The check-off for deficit reduction amounts to a truly ominous war on government -- indeed, a war on the poor. Instead of having Congress, elected on the basis of one person one vote, decide how much to reduce the deficit, Mr. Bush would empower individuals to decide. Only in his scheme, votes are proportional to income -- in effect giving the rich the power to kill programs for the poor.
After Houston, Mr. Bush hit the campaign trail, much as Bill Clinton did. A wise move: He has but two months to turn a list of dubious and disconnected proposals into a plausible, coherent agenda for growth. No amount of talk about family values can disguise that obligation.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Bush Gets Tough On Iraq

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB; Anna Quindlen is on vacation.

 BODY:
The decision to close the skies to Iraqi aircraft below the 32d parallel makes good sense. It protects Iraqi Shiites from Saddam Hussein's murderous ways. It also could weaken Saddam. His rush to invite U.N. inspectors for a firsthand look at the Shiite situation proves he understands the danger.
But check out the story behind the decision. It shows the lengths to which President Bush will go to win re-election, and how far his foreign friends will lean to help him. It also shows that crass political motives sometimes lead to good foreign policy. 
 Of course, Bush Administration officials say there is an important new element below the 32d parallel, namely Iraqi use of fixed-wing aircraft to bomb Shiites. This factor, they insist, overcame doubts about military action on the part of Mr. Bush and Brent Scowcroft, his national security adviser.
But that explanation sounds limp. Iraqi forces have been using helicopters all along. With fighting now concentrated in the marshlands, helicopters would seem a much more effective weapon than fast-moving fixed-wing aircraft. It is not clear that bombing by aircraft helps much militarily.
In any event, Administration officials are quick to add that Mr. Bush and his coalition partners have a larger purpose in imposing the "no fly" rule. It is to prevent Saddam from committing "genocide" against the Shiites. (So, what about genocide in Bosnia?)
An admirable goal in Iraq, but not credible as the driving reason behind the new decision. Saddam reportedly has been slaughtering the Shiites for 18 months, and the allies never lifted a finger to help.
Administration officials, then, fall back to the deeper reason for the new get-tough policy: toppling Saddam. The idea is to face the highly nationalistic Iraqi military with a choice between preserving the unity of the country and retaining Saddam.
Yet the allies could have put the "no fly" squeeze on Saddam and sent that signal to his military months ago, and saved many Shiite lives to boot.
Again, officials say there are reasons. They wanted and still want to keep Iraq whole to ward off scrambles for Iraqi territory by neighbors. They claim, dubiously, they satisfied Turkish concerns by making clear the U.S. would not support an independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq. Yet they worry about the ties between the Iraqi Shiites and their Iranian brethren, and the threat to Saudi Arabia.
Bush aides say they finally came to realize that the Iraqi Shiites are more "Iraqi" than "Iranian" and "fundamentalist." They now believe they can safely aid the Shiites without actually splitting this territory from Iraq. The aides admit this is a tricky and risky line to walk. Indeed it is, and Mr. Bush -- and especially the Saudis -- chose not to walk it until a few weeks ago.
At that moment of revelation about Shiites a few weeks ago, what was truly new in the situation surfaced not in Iraq but in the U.S. Bill Clinton pulled way ahead in the polls, and Mr. Bush began searching the horizon for a magic campaign bullet. There, he found new resolve to confront the bully who had made him so popular in the first place and whose smiling presence hangs gloomily over the Bush Presidency.
It seems plausible that key Desert Storm partners dropped their strong objections to military action south of the 32d parallel mainly to elevate Mr. Bush's election prospects. Prime Minister John Major owes him for helping his recent comeback in British elections, and King Fahd owes him for saving Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Bush must resort to foreign extravaganzas for November. He cannot hope to turn the economy around in the next 70 days.
So look for whirlwind world action, which James Baker is already orchestrating out of the White House. There soon will be a much-needed, nonstop conference on Yugoslavia and maybe a high-profile Mideast summit meeting. More dramatically, U.S. fighters will shoot down Iraqi planes if Saddam is dumb enough to test the President. Mr. Bush is even ready to go further and use his fighter-bombers against Iraqi tanks and troops if they attack the Shiites again.
While Mr. Bush's motives churn unreliably in political impurities, they carry him toward better policies he has long ignored or resisted.

HEADLINE: American Electric Power: A Help . . .

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Coal-Burning Utility That's Trying to Paint Itself Green," (July 26) leaves the impression that the American Electric Power Corporation's donation of reclaimed land to the International Center for the Preservation of Wild Animals (now known as the Wilds) was a thinly disguised public relations exercise. On the contrary. The loss of jobs in southeastern Ohio resulting from coal-mining cutbacks is a major concern and A.E.P.'s gift ultimately will result in the creation of employment opportunities for the region. 
 Most significantly, it was A.E.P.'s expensive reclamation and careful attention to positive environmental standards over the years that made this area ideal for endangered species breeding and preservation. The mission of the Wilds is to serve as a unique resource for zoological parks and for university and field scientists involved in restoration ecology, species reintroduction and myriad other investigations. Ultimately, the Wilds will attract thousands of visitors who wish to see, experience and learn more about the natural world. These visitors, in turn, will require services and those services mean more jobs for the people of the region.
By providing the land, A.E.P. has contributed to an enormously significant conservation project, and provided a sustainable benefit to the area economy.

Paranoia in the Ranks? No, Realism.

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
Middle- and less-than-middle managers may be forgiven if the current terms of art in human resources -- including downsizing and streamlining -- seem more like euphemisms for bloodletting. According to Workplace Trends, a newsletter that keeps track of corporate staff cuts at all levels nationwide, 550,000 lost their jobs last year, up from 110,000 in 1989, when Workplace began collecting the data.
Because much of the current cutting is coming from their ranks, middle managers may also be forgiven for feeling that they have been forced into a nasty game of duck-and-cover by senior executives hunkered down and pushing buttons far from any set of coordinates that might put them at risk. 
 That feeling, however excessive it may sound, is not an illusion, according to research by three business school professors who tracked the efforts of 46 large companies to reverse their reverses in fortune -- defined in the research as at least a year of negative earnings. Kose John and Larry Lang, finance professors at New York University, and Jeffry Netter, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Georgia, report in the current issue of the Journal of Finance that companies have many first-strike responses to intimations of disaster.
"They retrench quickly," Mr. Lang said. "They become more focused, sell assets and divisions." Using 1980-90 information from Standard & Poor's Compustat data base and company documents, as well as news accounts, the three researchers found, among other things, that the corporations under study typically cut some 2,000 employees, or about 5 percent of their work force, in the first year after the negative earnings.
What the companies don't do is introspect much about the reasons for their plight. Most companies first blame what the authors call "exogenous variables" -- external conditions -- for their problems, including the state of the economy, mentioned by 92 percent of the companies, and competition, foreign and otherwise, mentioned by roughly half. The "endogenous," or internal, problems include writeoffs, failed acquisitions, high costs and -- way down the list -- poor management or mistakes.
In bad times, said Mr. John, "the super rational strategy would be to cut labor and make changes in top management. But on average the top man does not turn over." The study found little difference between the average turnover rate of top management at firms in general and the turnover rate for companies in trouble. "Top managers," said Mr. Lang, "never, never blame themselves."
The researchers acknowledge that they do not have data to say that poor management alone led the companies under scrutiny into a big muddy. But Mr. John argues that at some point "external factors" become mere excuses. "They play some role, but the issue is, should top management have anticipated them?" he said. Mr. Lang added: "That's their job. They make millions of dollars, but they cannot handle a crisis."
The authors stop short of saying that palming off blame is a flaw of the American character. But, Mr. Lang said, Honda never uses economic conditions, even for its United States plants, to explain away problems. General Motors, on the other hand, has used recession, and the market's shift to small cars, to account for its woes.
Mr. John and Mr. Lang say they expect the thinning of the middle ranks to continue for five more years, as companies that diversified in the 80's return to their "core competence" areas. A transition to high efficiency is imperative, they say, and the process will continue to be painful for many. But unless a company is actually close to bankruptcy, said Mr. Lang, "C.E.O.'s don't suffer."

HEADLINE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL;
New Year's Revolution: Bowls Try Banding Together

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN

 BODY:
Not so long ago, when all those representatives of bowl games set out each autumn in their brightly colored blazers to seek teams, they were united only in a distrust of their competitors, a willingness to be entertained and a desperate need to find a respectable clothier.
 But now the Orange, Cotton, Sugar and Fiesta Bowls have banded together with six conferences and Notre Dame in an effort to introduce the concepts of dignity and organization to the college football season. The merger of all those loud jackets into a Rainbow Coalition could eventually mark 1992 as the year in which chaos began to give way to order on New Year's day and night. 
Unless chaos forces a punt.
 The coalition members are hoping their nine-year agreement will allow the bowls to collectively market and sell the same type of late-season suspense, week by week, that has made the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament a billion-dollar event.
 
Matchup Speculation Won't End
 Plan on hearing the word "unless" a lot this season. As the parity achieved by years of scholarship limitations further complicates college football's long-established order, bowl scenarios could come and go in the time it takes to set up a field goal attempt, and the possible matchups could change by the week.
 In a season that has already seen the unveiling of Northwestern's new slogan -- EXPECT VICTORY! -- you weren't really banking on the status quo, were you?
 The purpose of the coalition, according to its founders, is to create the best possible matchups and not merely No. 1 vs. No. 2. But nearly nine months after Miami won the Orange Bowl and Washington won the Rose Bowl to stake conflicting claims to the unofficial national title, a championship match could be the coalition's biggest, and most difficult, triumph.
 
Traditional Alliances Preserved
 The new system will rely on the continuing relationships between conference champions and three of the four bowls -- the Big Eight Conference with the Orange Bowl, the Southwest with the Cotton Bowl, and the Southeastern with the Sugar. The champion of the realigned S.E.C. will be determined by the first conference championship game, between east and west division winners, on Dec. 5 in Birmingham, Ala. The game is expected to produce at least $4.5 million for the conference.
 If the first and second-rated teams in the country come from the Big East Conference, the Atlantic Coast Conference or Notre Dame, those two teams will meet in the Fiesta Bowl.
 If those teams are not No. 1 and 2, the Orange, Cotton and Sugar Bowls will select opponents in order of the ranking of the Big Eight, S.W.C. and S.E.C. champions by The Associated Press poll of reporters and broadcasters. The Fiesta Bowl would choose last.
 The Big East and A.C.C. champions are guaranteed spots in the Orange, Sugar or Cotton Bowls. A plan to use the A.P. poll may be replaced by a formula that incorporates the USA Today/CNN poll of coaches.
 The most potentially damaging flaw of the system is this: If two of the teams from the Big East, A.C.C. or Notre Dame -- say the Irish and Miami -- happen to be Nos. 1 and 3, or Nos. 2 and 3, the agreement does not include a provision for them to meet.
 At a conference scheduled for late this week in New York City, coalition members intend to devise the marketing strategy they hope will enable them to explain the system to anyone who does not yet understand it.
 Which seems to be nearly everybody.
 "Let's don't start shootin' holes in something that hasn't had a chance yet," said Jim (Hoss) Brock of the Cotton Bowl. "A lot of people are taking shots at us that don't know what they're talking about. The best thing is to grin at 'em and head on down the road."
 The problem the football establishment faces is that the road the coalition is taking remains unpaved and uncharted, and its trip comes at an economically perilous time.
 Football programs will soon be limited to 85 scholarships. Pressures to make the percentages of male and female athletes more closely resemble those for student populations may result in limits on the size of football squads. The expansion of the National Football League season threatens the New Year's Day showcase that the colleges have enjoyed for decades. And the departure of underclassmen to the pros has cost college football Heisman Trophy attractions like Michigan's Desmond Howard.
 
Big Ten Precipitated Move
 Critics have already described the coalition as far from perfect and ready to collapse under its own weight.
 "Let me ask you one question," said Brock, the Cotton Bowl man. "Where would we be if we weren't in it?"
 A plausible answer is this: in deeper trouble. The decision of the Big Ten conference last year to commit its runner-up to the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Fla., and a third team to the Holiday Bowl in San Diego, Calif., threatened to reduce the bowl system to a collection of pre-arranged marriages. Bowl tie-ins would have guaranteed much-needed revenue for conferences. But a lack of flexibility in creating matchups might have led to a credibility crisis for a disorganized bowl system already known for its backroom dealing.
 Matchups would not be finalized until after the S.E.C. championship game on Dec. 5, although some could become obvious before that point. Barring the presence of an undefeated team in the Rose Bowl between the Big Ten and the Pac-10 Conference champions, the coalition would be virtually guaranteed of having the most attractive teams.
 Unless Penn State is undefeated. In its final season as an independent, Penn State was not included when the coalition finalized its agreement. The Nittany Lions, in an effort to salvage a spot in the rapidly changing bowl marketplace, agreed on May 20 to go to the Blockbuster Bowl in Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium.
 This is how the coalition's first season could become bizarre. Pac-10 teams play eight-game league schedules, and U.C.L.A., which is considered Washington's biggest threat, is the one conference team the Huskies will not play.
 If the two teams tie for the Pac-10 championship and their overall records are the same, the Rose Bowl spot would go to the team that has gone the longest since its last trip to Pasadena on New Year's Day.
 The scheduling quirk could mean that an undefeated and highly ranked Washington team might not play in the Rose Bowl. And since the second team from the Pac-10 is available to the coalition bowls, a Miami-Washington game could happen in the Fiesta Bowl.
 Unless . . .

HEADLINE: Muted Hostility and Seeds of Hope

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE with MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
A year after violence between blacks and Jews ripped through Crown Heights, "there is turmoil," said Mildred Scott, a retired school administrator who is active in many community groups, referring to residents' anxieties about police protection, equality in city services and the future of the neighborhood.
"But," said Mrs. Scott, who is black, "there is also a new awakening. People believe they can make a change." 
 Despite such statements, Mrs. Scott and many other Crown Heights residents are haunted by the indelible sounds and images of their community last August: Jewish men, fists and weapons raised, racing through the streets; black youths overturning police cars; neighbors hurling racial epithets, bottles and rocks.
 
Grief, Anger and Violence
 The violence, which went on for four days, was set off by a day of grief and anger in which a 7-year-old black child, Gavin Cato, was killed by a car driven by a Hasidic man. Hours later, the police said, a 29-year-old Hasidic scholar visiting from Australia, Yankel Rosenbaum, was surrounded by a gang of black youths and stabbed to death, apparently in retaliation.
The chaos grabbed headlines around the world and inspired a one-woman play, "Fires in the Mirror," a critical and popular success, in which the actress Anna Deavere Smith performed monologues of more than 20 different characters involved in the confrontations.
These days the streets of Crown Heights are quieter, said most of the dozens of residents interviewed in the last few days. But they concede that it is an uneasy peace, born more of a desire to avoid further violence than to foster profound understanding between blacks and Hasidim. The changes are most often expressed in small civilities between neighbors of different races: a simple hello or thank you. Many black and Hasidic residents temper their words and actions lest they offend. Walks have less swagger, words have less bite.
 
Working for Understanding
 More ambitious residents have joined committees and formed an interracial basketball team and rap group. They have painted murals calling for peace. They have spent hundreds of hours discussing tensions over which groups get more in the way of housing, police protection and other city services.
"I try to be more friendly to my black neighbors and they do the same," said Ohev Sholom, 42, a maintenance worker. "If I try to cross in the middle of the street, a black man will stop his car and let me. That wouldn't have happened last year."
Bryan Scott, 19, who works at the Brooklyn Children's Museum, admits that the change is often tentative. "There is the understanding that there has to be interaction, but nothing personal," he said. "I guess fear is the best word, but it is not really fear, we just don't want to go through that hassle. It's not good to go to sleep with helicopters overhead."
Even for New York, Crown Heights is a neighborhood of striking contrasts. The very poor live only blocks away from the well to do. On one block, reggae music blares from once-graceful apartment buildings where windows are boarded up and graffiti covers the crumbling walls and shattered doors. Black youths gather to socialize outside corner bodegas. On another, Jewish women, their heads covered in keeping with their religion, dart in and out of well-kept homes where they live side by side with black professionals. Hasidic men in black coats and fedoras pass black teen-agers in oversized blue jeans and baseball caps.
As they work toward better communication, black and Jewish community leaders say they have worked to garner more jobs and better housing for their followers, to elect more responsive leaders and to pressure city officials for services.
 
Years-Old Chasm, Common Ground
 A few of those interviewed saw no need for change, believing that last August's violence was an aberration in their otherwise harmonious community. Some said that the little acts of civility that have proliferated since the unrest do not address inequities that exist in the treatment of two groups. And most agreed that the best thing to come out of the violence was the public admission that there were longstanding hostilities between blacks and Jews. The chasm between them has existed for so long, they say, that it is unrealistic to expect marked change in one year.
"If the gap was so large, it is not going to be filled overnight," said Lola Poisson, executive director of the Haitian Community Health Project in Crown Heights.
Rabbi Shea Hecht, a spokesman for the Crown Heights Jewish Community Emergency Committee, which was formed during last summer's violence, finds that "most of the people here get along."
"Do we love each other?" he asked. "No, we don't love each other. But I don't know if that's necessary."
On Tuesday, Richard Green, the executive director of the Crown Heights Youth Collective and one of those who kept last year's disturbances from becoming more violent, supervised the finishing touches on a "Unity Wall" mural painted by black and Hasidic youths across the street from the faded red cross painted on the sidewalk where Gavin Cato was struck. The mural depicts a Noah's Ark scene and faces of various races. "It's about us building for us," said Mr. Green, his paint-splattered orange overalls hanging on his tall, wiry frame. "That's what we've learned in this past year. We have to teach our young people a certain level of respect, a certain level of morality."
Mr. Green says he would like to see the surrounding block permanently closed to traffic, to create both a safe haven for children to play and a market for pushcart merchants.
After the violence, Rose Wexler, whose days are spent shopping and caring for her four children, joined an interracial women's group, the Brooklyn Women's Coalition, where she has begun making friends outside her Hasidic community.
"You're looking at a person who went through a terrible time during the riots," she said. "But I feel that I'll accomplish a lot more by looking at those things that bind us as mothers, as wives and as Americans. My approach over the past year has been to work with the positive."
Avrohom Shemtov, a 22-year-old student, admitted that he had grown up believing that "most blacks were criminals." Now, he has made friends with black students in his classes at Kingsborough Community College. Last semester he enrolled in a discussion group at Brooklyn College for Jewish and black youths to discuss their respective cultures and perspectives. He plans to continue with the group this fall.
Baku James, an eighth grader at Intermediate School 51, made friends with a Jewish boy who was also enrolled in an art program at the Brooklyn Children's Museum that encouraged black and Hasidic youth to work together. "People kept to themselves before the riot," he said. "Now people are trying to understand each other."
Baku said that despite such attempts at understanding, he and his new friend still live in largely separate worlds, with Eastern Parkway as the line of demarcation: Jews to the north and blacks to the south.
"If we have to go over there we don't say nothing to them," he said. "And if they have to come over here, they don't say nothing."
Despite their differences, both the black and Jewish communities of Crown Heights have been victimized by discrimination and are sensitive to perceived slurs from any group.
 
Handshakes, Smiles And Basic Hostility
 In Crown Heights, the ultra-Orthodox Hasidim see themselves as outsiders even among other Jews and as easy targets for dissatisfied blacks. The neighborhood's unemployment rate for blacks is higher than in other parts of Brooklyn and schools are among the most crowded in the city. A report prepared by a black-Jewish coalition appointed by the Brooklyn Borough President's office found that 22,000 recent immigrants, most from the Caribbean, are adding to the competition for scarce city resources.
Additionally, the Hasidic community practices separatism from the outside world as a matter of faith, so that even basic civilities like shaking hands with members of the opposite sex are curtailed by religious law.
"When we talk about having the young people get together, it does create a certain amount of anxiety about going too far in the togetherness -- about overstepping boundaries," said Rabbi Abraham Flint, a spokesman for the Crown Heights Jewish Community Council.
There are blacks and Jews who believe that the handshakes and smiles and attention to boundaries have not changed the environment that fomented last August's turmoil. Each side believes the other gets a disproportionate share of housing, quicker police response, and more city money for their community programs. Until those inequities are addressed, they say, another racially charged incident will simply precipitate more days and nights of violence.
Thaddeus Owens Jr., a black community organizer who is the son of the judge who presided over the case in which a black youth, Yusuf K. Hawkins, was killed after venturing into a white neighborhood, said that he felt racial tensions have grown in Crown Heights in the last year.
Reginald Butts, who owns a packing and shipping business, has lived in Crown Heights for more than 30 years. He said he had not really seen any change. "There is a basic hostility that persists to this day," he said. "You may be walking down the street and four or five Hasidic men will be walking in the opposite direction and none of them will yield."
Rabbi Shmuel Buttman, a spokesman for the Crown Heights Community Emergency Committee, said that since last August, "the quality of life has not been the same."
"People are afraid to walk in the street," he said. "You have to look over shoulders. It has left a mark on this community."
There are tests ahead for the fragile peace of Crown Heights.
On Tuesday night, the freshly painted "Unity Wall" mural, across the street from where Gavin Cato was struck by a car, was defaced. White paint was smeared over the mural's white, Asian and American Indian faces, but the black faces were untouched. The vandalism was denounced by community leaders, but some said they hoped it showed how much work is still needed.
 
'A Lot of Anger And a Lot of Hate'
 Earlier this month, after months of pressure from Jewish groups to arrest black youths involved in last August's violence, Raymond Wesley, a 28-year-old was charged with inciting the disturbance. When arrested in April, Mr. Wesley was initially charged with first-degree riot, but a grand jury voted to reduce the charges. Some blacks have argued that Mr. Wesley was arrested arbitrarily to appease the Hasidic community, which they say has strong ties to the Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes. Mr. Hynes has denied any favoritism.
Next month, Lemrick Nelson, 16, goes on trial in the stabbing death of Yankel Rosenbaum, the Hasidic scholar stabbed hours after Gavin Cato's death. Mr. Nelson, who is charged with two counts of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon, faces up to 25 years to life in prison if convicted. Many blacks are angry that no charges have been filed in the crash that claimed Gavin's life. The police ruled that it was an accident and that the driver was not at fault.
"There is a lot of anger and a lot of hate, unfortunately, on both sides," said Henry Rice, a program specialist with the National Conference, formerly the National Conference of Christians and Jews. Mr. Rice, 23, joined the organization last December. He is black and has lived in Crown Heights for 11 years.
"The attitude of a lot of Jewish people in the neighborhood is that as long as there is quiet and calm, there is peace," Mr. Rice said. "That is suicidal. When it's quiet, people are just waiting to see what's going to happen next."
Yet he points to his own situation as a sign of hope. He said he had purposely learned about other peoples and other cultures and formed many relationships with people of good will through the National Conference.
"There was a beautiful house on President Street I used to ride my bike past as a kid and wonder who lived there," Mr. Rice said. "I was in that house the other day, sitting with the Jewish owners, trying to figure out how to bring people together. That's progress."

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
In Dead of Summer, Dreams of Ski Heaven

BYLINE: By Michael S. Malone; Michael S. Malone writes frequently about Silicon Valley from Los Altos, Calif.

 BODY:
It was the hottest week of the year -- over 90 degrees -- in Silicon Valley, but for the daredevil skiing executive, now is the time to make reservations for this winter's excursion.
Not for this group the crowded winter resorts of Lake Tahoe or Aspen. Real skiing occurs in places that only helicopters can reach, where runs are measured in miles, avalanches lurk around every bend, and in a week of skiing one might not cross a single ski track. 
 Operators of "heli-skiing" adventures now offer trips to the Sierra Nevada in eastern California, the Wasatch Range in Utah and even northern India. But the most action is in the Canadian Rockies of British Columbia, in mountain ranges with unlikely names like the Bugaboos, Cariboos, Monashees, Adamants, Gothics and Bobbie Burns. By far the biggest organizer of these expeditions is Canadian Mountain Holidays Inc. of Banff, Alberta. It now sends helicopter trips to nine areas of the Canadian Rockies and has six lodges, 300 employees and $24 million in annual revenues.
Celebrated names on the C.M.H. guest list include King Juan Carlos of Spain; Richard Marriott, vice chairman of the Marriott Corporation; Pierre Trudeau; Willy Bogner, the Olympic gold medalist and chairman and chief executive of Bogner Fashion, and William T. Esrey, chairman and chief executive of Sprint. Visiting royalty pose special challenges, said Martin Von Neudegg, a C.M.H. vice president, because Canada requires they be accompanied by security personnel. The result can be armed bodyguards made to ski down mountain slopes hundreds of miles from the nearest possible threat.
Silicon Valley has had its own contingent, including James Morgan, chief executive of Applied Materials, the venture capitalist William Davidow, and the semiconductor industry pioneer Robert Noyce, who died in 1990. Like many others, Mr. Davidow recalls his most memorable moment as flying off a cliff "and looking down through my skis and seeing the ground get further and further away, then closer and closer, and then landing in an explosion of powder."
Mr. Morgan talks of the cleansing of the spirit that comes during such vacations. "The high altitude and clean air revitalize your mind and soul," he said.
For Canadian Mountain Holidays, 14-passenger twin-jet Bell 212 choppers not only deliver customers to the slopes, but are the only contact the lodges have with the outside world.
That's not to suggest these lodges are primitive. Each comes with Jacuzzi, sauna, full bar, massage therapists and gourmet chefs. Just because the snow is up to the roof and the nearest building is over the horizon doesn't mean you can't enjoy medallions of veal in lemon tarragon mousse or other entrees good enough to have been written up in Gourmet magazine. There's even a baker at each lodge.
This luxury is matched by what awaits outside. A typical day during the standard one-week visit begins at 7:30 A.M. with a stretching class, old-fashioned mountain breakfast and then the chopper ride up a nearby mountain. Groups of 11 and a trained guide do 8 to 15 runs a day, ranging from 2,500 to 7,000 vertical feet each (the longer an approximately 4.7-mile run). Even when the lodges are full, there are at most 44 skiers from C.M.H. on terrain the size of Rhode Island, so there is little chance of feeling crowded. If the weather is good, lunch is served on the slopes. Between 4:30 and 6 P.M., it's back to the lodge for a soak or rubdown, then the gourmet dinner. Afterward, ski movies are sometimes shown or the guests organize skits or costume nights. Mostly, there's a lot of talk, some of it about business. For example, the idea behind what was to become the Association for California Tort Reform, a program to reduce litigiousness in the state, was born in one such late-night conversation.
None of this comes cheap. Rates begin at $2,282 per person and climb to $4,350 per person per week, depending on the time of year. The highest rates are in February and March in a season that begins two weeks before Christmas and runs until the beginning of May. That covers everything, including skis and a guarantee of 100,000 vertical feet of skiing. There is also that soupcon of danger required by every overachiever: The Canadian Rockies is notorious for fatal avalanches. On top of that, there are the usual accidents that happen when humans hurdling down mountainsides collide with trees and rocks. More than one chief executive has had a leg or arm sewn up on the dining table. Luckily, because at least a third of the clientele is doctors, there is sometimes a trained physician around to do the stitching.
Despite these impediments, helicopter skiing has proven immensely popular. Since its founding in 1965, Canadian Mountain Holidays has served 62,000 skiers. (Its summer "heli-hiking" program, which offers a similar program for wilderness hikes, has had 19,000 clients since 1978.) Not surprisingly, some of these customers are true ski fanatics. More than 550 have skied more than one million vertical feet with C.M.H., enough to earn a special ski suit as a reward ("My $30,000 ski outfit," jokes one honoree). Ned Damon, a former rodeo and water ski champion, has skied 9,370 miles -- the equivalent of a trip from New York to Switzerland and back -- over years of 17-week stays. Mr. Damon's wife, Carolyn, has skied 13 million vertical feet.
But even in this exclusive skier's paradise, the vagaries of the outside world intrude, most notably in a changing guest list that reflects the ups and downs of the economy. For example, Mr. Von Neudegg said with a laugh, "We used to get a lot more guys from Drexel Burnham than we do now."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Baker Returns, Bringing Tried-and-True Tactics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
With but 10 weeks to election day, James A. Baker 3d took over as White House chief of staff this evening amid expectations that he planned to reorder the top of the Republican re-election apparatus.
Mr. Baker replaced Samuel K. Skinner as President Bush's top aide at 6:30 this evening, minutes after the President returned from a post-convention speaking trip to a carefully orchestrated welcome by a thousand cheering Federal employees and their families at the White House. 
 Under Mr. Baker's direction, aides said, the campaign will shun major policy initiatives in the remaining 73 days before the election, concentrating instead on a relentless effort to cast Mr. Bush as a better-prepared, more capable and more trustworthy leader than his Democratic challenger, Gov. Bill Clinton.
 
What Worked in '88
 The same tactic worked in 1988, when Mr. Baker took over the President's campaign in late summer and it roared from behind to trounce the Democratic nominee, Michael S. Dukakis. Mr. Baker will be helped by a team of aides, all veterans of the 1988 race, who are following him from the State Department to the White House.
Mr. Baker is expected to put his stamp on the White House and the campaign rapidly. A senior White House official said in a recent interview that the President had given his old friend the authority to hire and fire both White House and re-election staff members.
As Mr. Baker has already swept out the top ranks of the White House, replacing Mr. Skinner's staff with his own advisers in virtually every decision-making position, he was widely expected to "run a rake through the campaign," as one Republican associate of Mr. Baker said late last week.
 
Sticking With Teeter?
 Bush aides and Republican strategists said Mr. Baker has been urged to recruit a veteran political strategist to oversee operations at the Bush campaign offices four blocks from the White House, but it was far from clear whether he would follow that advice. Other Republican Party officials said he could well decide instead to rely on the campaign's current chairman and his old friend, Robert M. Teeter, to execute a strategy dictated by the White House.
Mr. Teeter runs the campaign's daily affairs and oversees long-range strategy, and Frederic V. Malek, an investor and airline executive, manages its finances and operations. A Washington lobbyist and conservative political strategist, Charles Black, has acted as a senior adviser to the two.
Officials called it unlikely that Mr. Baker would risk further turmoil in Mr. Bush's re-election bid by dismissing top officials outright. But they also agreed that the locus of decision-making will shift from the campaign offices to the White House, and that the authority of some of the top three will diminish dramatically in fact, if not in title.
"The very first thing you have to do is walk in the door and immediately set a tone and direction, and start moving," said a senior Administration official who is familiar with Mr. Baker's thinking. "Everything has to be integrated. You're talking about the entire process of defining what is the difference between George Bush and his challenger, and we've only got 10 weeks to do it."
Another Administration official who is an associate of both Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker said: "Baker's not going to run the campaign. The nuts and bolts will stay where they are. But the two most important things now are where the President goes, and what he says. And both of those things are going to be coming out of the White House from now on."
 
Doomsaying Officials
 Circumstances are vastly changed this summer from those in 1988, and Mr. Baker's associates and Administration officials are already seeking to lower expectations of his success.
Several of them noted in interviews last week that Mr. Baker this time was taking over both a White House and a campaign on the fly, coming from a short vacation and work on Middle East peace talks, the war in Bosnia and the growing crisis in Iraq.
Some of this aides are in a similar position. One top State Department official who will accompany Mr. Baker to the White House, Dennis Ross, was vacationing in California last week. A second, Margaret Tutwiler, returned only today from a safari in Africa.
Asked about changes in the campaign, one Baker associate responded: "That's going to be the subject of some discussion. I can't tell you how much we don't know about the campaign."
Such ignorance is probably overstated. Mr. Baker is legendary for his ability to stage manage the perception of his role, and there is ample reason for him to depict this crisis as a struggle that for which he is ill prepared, and which he could well lose.
Mr. Baker may indeed lose, but there is little chance that he is ill prepared, for that is not his nature.
As Secretary of State in mid-July, well before his shift to the White House was announced, Mr. Baker had already solicited advice from advisers on whether and how he should take on a new White House role. This month, engulfed as he was in diplomatic work, he still found time to devise a farewell address to State Department employees that became the blueprint for Mr. Bush's own acceptance speech at the Republican convention, and very likely for the campaign itself.
 
Prime Office Space
 Coming with him to the White House are the four aides who more or less oversaw the State Department for Mr. Baker for the last four years, and who will effectively run the White House for the duration of the campaign. Their roles and importance are reflected in the locations of their new offices in the coveted West Wing of the White House.
Mr. Baker will take the spacious yellow-and-white office held by Mr. Skinner, barely 40 steps from the Oval Office. Closest to him, in a windowless room occupied until now by a counselor to Mr. Skinner, will be Ms. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman and Mr. Baker's closest adviser.
Ms. Tutwiler will take the job of White House communications director, now held by Marlin Fitzwater, overseeing speech writing and scheduling. But a primary duty will be to serve as Mr. Baker's link to the national press -- the one White House official, aside from Mr. Bush himself, who knows Mr. Baker's thinking and can speak for him without hesitation.
Next to Ms. Tutwiler, in an office held until now by Mr. Skinner's deputy, Henson Moore, will be Robert B. Zoellick, the new deputy chief of staff. Mr. Zoellick, the former undersecretary of state for economic affairs, will manage the White House staff and work on policy options for a second term.
Upstairs, on the second floor, will be Dennis Ross, another policy expert who will oversee the Bush domestic agenda, and Janet G. Mullins, who will handle political affairs. They will take over offices once held by Mr. Skinner's domestic-policy experts, Clayton K. Yeutter and Roger B. Porter.
Mr. Skinner and Mr. Porter are moving to rooms in a staff building across the street from the White House. Mr. Skinner will remain about a week to help Mr. Baker before becoming general chairman of the Republican National Committee, a new post created for him this month.

HEADLINE: Latin American Indians: Old Ills, New Politics

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INGENIERO JACOBACCI, Argentina

 BODY:
It had snowed a foot and a half deep three days earlier, and a biting wind whipped down the hills around the Atraico reservation in the stretch of Patagonian wasteland that is home to 22 families of the Mapuche Indian tribe.
Secundino Cona, a 65-year-old Mapuche with a square, weathered face, huddled with his wife, Dominga Miyaleo, and their two sons around the tiny wood-burning stove in their dirt-floor adobe hut, sipping mate, a drink steeped from dried leaves of a South American evergreen. 
 Mr. Cona spoke of the firewood promised by the province government that never seems to arrive, and about his inability to imagine electricity, running water, television or automobiles ever being part of daily life here.
"The winter is very sad on the reservation," he said. "Animals die. Children get sick. We are alone."
Such pessimism, against such a harsh backdrop, could be repeated by many Indians throughout Latin America. From the Sierra Madre of Mexico to southern Patagonia, many of Latin America's 30 million indigenous people are living in a kind of permanent refugee status.
Whether the Indians are corralled into reservations like Atraico, pushed deeper and deeper into the Amazon jungle, or isolated in remote mountain areas, their cultures, religions and languages are under constant pressure from the Westernized world.
Five hundred years after the arrival of Europeans, Indians in Latin America eke out an existence far bleaker than that of native Americans.
"In the United States there is at least a sense of shame about how you treated the Indian and a feeling that some compensation is needed," said Edgardo Bujaryisqui, the Mayor of Ingeniero Jacobacci, 35 miles north of the Atraico reservation. "That consciousness or that sense of guilt just does not exist in Latin America."
Though life for the Mapuche is bleak, the group is perhaps one of the best examples of a growing trend in the last five years in Latin America of Indian groups trying to assert their rights, reclaim territory, and challenge existing laws and Government policies. Mapuche from Chile and Argentina recently proclaimed the intention of creating their own nation, and in the Chilean city of Temuco, a Mapuche leader was jailed for calling on Indians to refuse to pay taxes to the Chilean Government and to refrain from voting.
 
Will Some Groups Survive?
 But the prospects of redress for the Indians of Latin America seem remote in light of the economic problems, including debt, that hobble the region. This, in turn, raises the question of whether the Indian cultures now on the margin of society can continue to survive on their own.
Some argue that it would be better to try to bring native groups into mainstream society, saying that attempts to preserve those cultures merely keep the Indians suspended in the past.
"There is what I call the National Geographic approach here, a ridiculous hope that these people are going to go back to the countryside and resume the wonderful rural, indigenous life again," said Hernando de Soto, a Peruvian economist. "That is not going to happen. What they forget is, to these people, the medical attention and education in Lima, for example, as bad as life might be, is 10 times better than rural bliss."
Others say it is absurd to talk of saving Indians by allowing their cultures to vanish.
"None of us are necessarily advocating that Indian groups should be frozen in time from the benefits that can be gotten from national society, such as education and health care," said Ted Macdonald, projects director at Cultural Survival, a Harvard-based research group for American Indians.
"These people are saying they want to be part of the world as equals, while maintaining a sense of their own identity and difference within that world."
 
Plight Varies Widely
 To be sure, the plight of Latin American Indian groups varies from country to country. The Brazilian and Venezuelan Governments, for example, have created large reservations for the Yanomami Indians, whose lands had been invaded by miners. But such moves generally come only after much pressure from Indian groups within the country and from international rights organizations.
In some of the countries with more prominent aboriginal populations, like Colombia and Bolivia, the Indians have become well enough organized that they have succeeded in getting favorable laws passed and getting members of their tribes elected to Congress.
There are some countries, like Mexico, where many citizens have some Indian ancestry and greatly prize their Indian heritage. But this does not often spill over into efforts to protect the land and culture of Indians who still practice the old ways.
And there are countries, like Peru, where the political control exercised by whites with bloodlines anchored in Europe is so strong that the needs of native groups are all but ignored.
 
Growing Sense of Despair
 "The policies of governments have been to let us die little by little without pain," said Eugolio Frites, a Kolla Indian from northern Argentina and a lawyer. "They don't think us capable of civilization."
These pressures have bred despair. Suicide is common in some tribes in the Amazon. In the Peruvian highlands, there is growing addiction to cocaine derivatives, a dangerous step beyond the coca-leaf chewing that has been Indian practice for centuries.
Government officials here estimate the per capita income of the Mapuche at less than $500 a year. Measuring the income of many Indians is nearly impossible, since the majority live on subsistence farming. Some groups deep in the Brazilian Amazon may seldom deal in currency, while Indians closer to cities may have a large number of people in the broader work force.
The United States Government spends $3.5 billion a year on programs covering the roughly one million Indians living on reservations, or $3,500 a person. The United States calculates that the average household income of American Indians on reservations is $20,025. Native groups in Canada fare even better.
Government help barely exists for Indian groups in Latin America. Anthropologists who study the region say they know of no program specifically aimed at helping Indians, though the Inter-American Development Bank and the United Nations are discussing the creation of an Indian fund of about $40 million that would be used to help Latin American indigenous groups.
 
Reformers Face Opposition
 Small groups from various Indian tribes across Latin America have been formed to express discontent and try to assert their rights. They often face powerful opposition.
In Chile, Pehuenche Indians are under pressure by the country's most profitable company, Endesa, to cooperate in the building of a series of dams on land that has traditionally been theirs.
In Brazil, the creation of reservations for the Yanomami and Kaiapo have brought a strong political backlash against the Government of Fernando Collor de Mello from mining and lumber interests.
Among the Mapuche, Indian rights advocates are divided between those who seek a closer relationship with the mainstream Argentine culture and province governments, and those who have adopted a more radical stand, calling for the creation of an autonomous Mapuche nation.
More than 200 representatives of the more radical Mapuche in Chile and Argentina met recently in Neuquen, in central Argentina, to discuss how to create a new nation and recoup large amounts of ancestral territory. But these are goals that many Mapuche leaders concede they are unlikely to achieve.
"Every time they rise up, they get hit with a blow that is two or three times worse," said Gustavo Flichman, a specialist in Indian affairs at the Center for Advanced Studies at the University of Buenos Aires. "They want to develop their culture without being stopped from being part of the mainstream of life. But so far that is impossible."
Mr. Flichman noted that in Argentina, which has 14 tribes and more than a million Indians in all, many live on public land or in national parks, but are barred from hunting and from using the wood there to build fires. Their indigenous religions are not legally sanctioned by the state. In many areas, Indians cannot get title to land they have lived on for generations. And when they try to live in the cities, they face frequent discrimination.
"Kids are told in school, 'Behave, don't act like an Indian,' " Mr. Flichman remarked.
Herded onto reservations or left to wander on public lands, the Mapuche found sheep farming their one source of income. But falling prices for wool and the increased fencing of grazing land by ranch owners have made conditions particularly difficult.
 
Inhospitaple for Shepherds
 The plains of Patagonia are so arid that it takes five acres to support one sheep. This was less of a problem when the range was open, but with the fencing of land, the pasture available to the Mapuche at Atraico is down to about 1,000 acres a family. The cost of irrigation is prohibitive.
Thus the typical Mapuche family here can graze at most 200 sheep, which produce about 1,600 pounds of wool a year. At the going rate of 40 cents a pound, the family's annual income is $640.
"The rich have fenced in the land," said Geronimo Colinamon. "Before, you could use the territory of the neighbors and we could have 1,000 sheep. Now I can have only about 150 sheep."
Mapuche worry that the social fabric of the reservation is crumbling. Since the land is supporting fewer people, most of the young leave to find work in the cities. Often they do not return.
"Two or three Mapuche can't do anything; we will just die out," said Ignacio Antitru, the Atraico community's political leader. "If we don't work together, we will lose our right to exist."
The system of chiefs, by which the reservations are governed, is also disappearing. Atraico's chief died several years ago, and the community has been unable to find anyone to replace him. Members now temporarily appoint one of their own to represent them at Mapuche gatherings and in contacts with the province government.
With the death of the chief, who also served as the tribe's religious leader, the annual religious festival called the camaruco, an important vehicle for maintaining the Mapuche language as well as religion, has also died. Very few Mapuche in Atraico speak the native tongue any more.
"We have practically lost the language," said Jose Colinamon, who lives in a tiny hut with his wife, Julia Rosa. "The old people are the ones who speak, but so few are left. And the young ones are pressured not to speak the language."
And Juan Sargento Profil, an 80-year-old chief from another reservation about 60 miles west of Atraico, explained matters this way: "Our god is angry with us -- that is why our life has been so hard. We have adopted the white man's religion. We are speaking his language. We are not doing camaruco. Therefore he lets the animals die."

Chart/Map: "Latin America's Indians: A Struggle to Survive"
 
Argentina 31.9 million pop./3% Indian
 In Patagonia, some Mapuche Indians say they want to form their own nation, regain ancestral territory and end the dire poverty of the Government-created reservations.
 
Bolivia 6.5 million/66%
 In the Beni jungle region, loggers are cutting down stands of huge trees on land inhabited by more than 130,000 Indians. In 1990, 700 people from 10 indigenous groups marched 400 miles from Trinidad to La Paz demanding that the Government give them control over 1.5 million acres of land.
 In La Paz, the capital, Aymara and Quechua Indians are buying radio stations and getting members elected to Congress.
 
Brazil 150.8 million/1%
 The Yanomami tribe is threatened by miners and gold prospectors. In 1991, the Government created a 68,331-square-mile reservation for the 12,000 Brazilian Yanomamis.
 Five hundred Kaiapo Indians living in the central Brazilian Amazon were given a 19,000-square-mile reservation in late 1991, over the objections of business interests. A recent rape case against a prominent Kaiapo chief has fueled bitter debate, raising fear that the Indian movement will be discredited.
 The Guarani-Kaiowa Indians living in the Dourados reserve have a high suicide rate.
 
Chile 12.8 million/9%
 On the Bio Bio River near Concepcion, Pehuenche Indians are trying to stop construction of hydroelectric dams
 
Colombia 31.9 million/1%
 The ancestral lands of more than 10,000 Paez and Guambiano Indians in the mountains near Cali are coveted by the Cali cocaine-trafficking cartel. Drug traffickers have enticed Indians into growing opium poppies. Indians have suffered four massacres at the hands of the traffickers. Three Indians campaigning for native rights were recently elected to the Colombian Congress.

 Lacandon Maya Indians have struggled to limit logging and encroachment in Chiapas state.
 Government-designated territory for 12,000 Huichol Indians in the Sierra Madre is nearly stripped of trees from decades of logging.
 
Nicaragua 3.5 million/3%
 Miskito Indians resisted efforts by the former Sandinista Government to control their lands on the Atlantic coast, and many who fled to Honduras are now back, facing daunting problems. Tensions continue between the Miskitos and the Sandinista-controlled Nicaraguan Army and police.
 About 6,000 Sumo Indians in the northwest risk losing territory because of recent logging agreements with the Japanese.
 
Peru 21.4 million/40%
 Ashaninkas and other Quechua Indians in the highlands are being recruited by the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas. Indians who don't join are often killed. Many end up fleeing to Lima

HEADLINE: U.S. WILL TIGHTEN HEALTH-LAB GOALS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has drafted a broad strategic plan that sets new priorities for the Government's vast biomedical research efforts, which until now have proceeded along largely disparate paths chosen by individual scientists and research institutions.
The Government plan is intended to channel $9 billion in Federal money to areas Washington deems critical to the nation's health, while for the first time also trying to insure that American medical researchers proceed along lines that keep the United States economically competitive. 
 The plan has alarmed many scientists, who say it gives the Government too big a role in defining priorities and places too much emphasis on the commercial exploitation of their work. These scientists say Washington is trying to set a national industrial policy.
 
A Call for Priorities
 But in an interview, Dr. Bernadine P. Healy, director of the National Institutes of Health and the principal architect of the new plan, said, "I don't understand why industrial policy is such a bad word." If scientists and the N.I.H. do not set clear priorities, she added, Congress and other outsiders will do so.
For a decade, the Reagan and Bush Administrations have resisted efforts by Democrats in Congress to get the Government more deeply involved in managing the economy, subsidizing new technologies and directing research, as Japan and some European nations do. The Administrations' free-market economists assert that the Government has no business picking winners and losers.
The strategic plan is intended to bring order to the network of research units that make up the N.I.H., through which the Government finances research on cancer, heart disease, AIDS, diabetes, arthritis, stroke and scores of other illnesses. It is also intended to clarify research goals to insure that the Government gets a high return on its investment of $9 billion a year. Eighty percent of that money goes through the N.I.H. to private researchers around the country; under the plan, substantial amounts of research money are expected to be awarded to scientists working in particular areas.
Among the plan's stated goals is to expand biomedical and related sciences "in order to enhance the nation's economic well-being." The plan says, for example, that such fields as biotechnology, molecular medicine, immunology and vaccine development should be favored because these areas offer "substantial contributions to the enhancement of the nation's economic growth, productivity and competitiveness."
"Critical science and technology are an investment in the future," the plan says.
Biotechnology sales in the United States totaled $4 billion last year and are expected to reach $50 billion by the year 2000, analysts at Ernst & Young say.
But Dr. William D. Terry, senior vice president at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, expressed the concern of many scientists that Government direction could have adverse effects.
"Unless you assure continued support for high-quality fundamental basic research, there is a potential for killing the goose that has laid many thousands of golden eggs," said Dr. Terry, who worked at the N.I.H. for two decades. "Ideas come out of the head and experience of an individual investigator and do not necessarily fit into the overall game plan of the N.I.H."
 
Economic Goals
 The scientists' concerns include these aspects of the N.I.H. blueprint:
*The strategic plan says that one of the main N.I.H. goals is "to enhance the nation's economic well-being"; an earlier draft said the goal was to increase the nation's "economic competitiveness." The economic payoff was, until now, seen as a happy byproduct of the Federal investment in biomedical research, not as an objective to be pursued for its own sake.
*While recognizing that the creative ideas of individual investigators are the engine of scientific research, the strategic plan makes clear that the Government will play a bigger role in defining overall priorities for such research. Many scientists doubt that the Government has the wisdom, foresight or expertise to set priorities or objectives for basic research.
*The N.I.H., which flourished as a loose amalgamation of many independent units, will now have a "corporate philosophy" and structure and will operate on a corporate model, with stronger central direction from Dr. Healy's office.
Dr. Healy, a cardiologist who worked on science policy in the Reagan White House, said: "The N.I.H. really does need a little more central leadership. If you have strong organizational units and no sense of central leadership, you have anarchy, people going in different directions, pulling against one another, duplicating effort, often destructively at odds. That kind of anarchy is not healthy for any organization."
But Dr. David P. Rall, who worked at the N.I.H. for 37 years, said, "I always thought good basic research flowered in a bed of anarchy."
Dr. Rall, who served as the director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences from 1971 to 1990, said Federal officials were "not smart enough to know which research will really be the most profitable."
In addition, Prof. David A. Clayton of Stanford University, a biochemist and molecular geneticist, said that science was moving so fast nowadays that a strategic plan might be outdated by the time it is published.
The strategic plan is subject to approval by the Public Health Service, the Department of Health and Human Services and the White House Office of Management and Budget. But Dr. Healy said it had already "made a difference in the distribution of money." N.I.H. officials are putting more emphasis on the health problems of women and minorities, nutrition, the prevention of disease and environmental health risks, she said.
Dr. Healy promised that the Government would not "micromanage" the work of private researchers who get N.I.H. grants.
The history of science is full of cases in which basic research, with no obvious practical application, produced major discoveries of immense unexpected value. For example, Dr. Baruch S. Blumberg, winner of the Nobel Prize in 1976, was trying to understand why people varied in their responses to disease when he found clues in the blood of an Australian aborigine that led to the discovery of the hepatitis B virus and to the invention of a vaccine against it.
Dr. Blumberg said the strategic plan must not undermine research inspired by the curiosity of individual scientists. "Much of the highly targeted research in the war on cancer in the 1970's was inappropriate because we did not know enough about the basic science of cancer virology," he said.
 
Healy Defends Plan
 But Dr. Healy said: "Priorities have always been set for research. But they were set secretly, chaotically, sometimes by accident. I am saying, 'Let's get the process out in the open, and let's get scientists more involved.' "
She also makes no apology for emphasizing the practical side of the agency's work. "We have allowed ourselves to be insular and ivory-towerish and were not connecting to the public," she said. "N.I.H. does not exist to do science for science's sake, but to do science in service of the public, to improve the health of 250 million Americans."
Stimulating economic growth is "a new responsibility for N.I.H. that did not exist 15 or 20 years ago," Dr. Healy said.
The guts of the strategic plan -- the statement of mission, goals and philosophy -- is firmly in place. Federal officials have not decided how much detail to include.
Their working papers suggest that they are likely to recommend networks of high-performance computers to study genes and design drugs; more aggressive work on vaccines, including vaccines to prevent cancer; more emphasis on the research needed for new biotechnology products, and more work on breast cancer, including studies of the genetic differences between male and female breasts.
Begun as a one-room laboratory in 1887, the N.I.H. now has 15,000 Federal employees and almost 200 advisory committees. It finances the work of 100,000 scientists at more than 1,800 institutions around the country. Research grants are awarded through a system of peer review, with outside experts judging the merits of each application.
Dr. William E. Harmon, director of the kidney-disease program at Children's Hospital in Boston, said: "There is a sort of chilling breeze blowing through basic science laboratories. Scientists are concerned that N.I.H. is going to tell us what to investigate, and we will lose some of our own initiative."
Dr. Steven L. Teitelbaum, a professor of pathology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, spoke for many scientists when he said: "The best basic research is hypothesis-driven. The scientist formulates a hypothesis and examines it according to the scientific method. My concern is that the strategic plan moves away from hypothesis-driven research toward pragmatic research."

HEADLINE: Chinese and South Koreans Formally Establish Relations

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Monday, Aug. 24

 BODY:
China and South Korea formally established diplomatic relations this morning, and Beijing announced that the South Korean President, Roh Tae Woo, would make an official visit "in the near future."
A joint statement, signed at a ceremony here and broadcast live on Chinese television, ended four decades of official hostility based on ideological rivalry and bitter memories of the Korean War of 1950-53. China took hundreds of thousands of casualties in joining North Korean troops in that war against American-led United Nations forces. The Chinese have remained one of North Korea's closest allies. 
 The statement today called for an exchange of ambassadors, and it requires South Korea to break diplomatic relations with the Chinese Nationalist authorities on Taiwan. Beijing will continue to recognize North Korea and could play a role as an intermediary between the two rival Governments on the Korean peninsula.
The statement said: "The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Korea believe that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries will be conducive to the relaxation of tension and stability on the Korean peninsula, and also to peace and stability in Asia."
South Korea hopes that Beijing will nudge the North toward a more accommodating policy, but the Chinese seemed to take a somewhat ambiguous position on that in the announcement today.
 
A Korean Matter, China Says
 The statement, which was signed by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China and his South Korean counterpart, Lee Sang Ock, said that Beijing respected the desire of the Korean people for quick reunification through peaceful means and supported their efforts to reach that goal. But it added that they must reach that goal "by themselves."
In Seoul, the South Korean capital, President Roh was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying: "The normalization of ties between our two countries marks a significant turning point in world history in that it heralds the beginning of the end of the cold war in East Asia, which remains as the last legacy of the cold war era."
In recent years, China has adopted an increasingly pragmatic foreign policy, based largely on economic interests rather than Communist ideology. It has recognized Israel and re-established relations with Indonesia, both of which it used to denounce regularly, and relations have been warming with South Africa as well.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton Criticizes President's Remarks on Religion

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton accused President Bush today of promoting religious and political intolerance in the United States for political gain.
In one of the sharpest counterattacks yet in the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton said that Mr. Bush had abandoned the American principle that individuals should be free to disagree on personal issues, especially religious and family values. 
 "I think he is promoting an atmosphere of intolerance in this country that is inconsistent with the spirit of Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln," the Arkansas Governor contended.
He was referring to a comment by Mr. Bush on Saturday that Democrats "took words to put together their platform but left out three simple letters: G,O,D."
 
Family and the Economy
 After attending a church service in Erie, Pa., the Democratic nominee told reporters: "The implications that he has made, that Democrats are somehow Godless, are deeply offensive to me and to all of us who cherish our religious convictions but also respect America's tradition of religious diversity. He has basically said that unless you believe in the Republican platform, you don't believe in God and you're not an American."
Mr. Clinton added that he thought Mr. Bush had made the comments for political purposes.
The introduction of religious tolerance into the campaign is the latest permutation in a debate that has come to interwine family values and the condition of the economy.
Mixed into the debate is a Republican assertion, more in the form of allusion than direct statement, that Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, are not good family people.
Mr. Clinton's response to this has been that he and his wife fully understand and respect family values, and that why else would they have spent much of their adult lives promoting health, education and job programs to help the nation's families and children?
"Now that's family values," he declared today in a speech to 5,000 or so people gathered on the grassy quadrangle in Chautauqua, the lake resort whose fame is built on its annual series of summer lectures.
If Mr. Bush truly understood and respected family values, Mr. Clinton argued in one of the more extensive speeches he has given on the subject, he would have made greater efforts to promote similar family programs and, moreover, would not have let the nation slip into a debilitating recession.
"I don't think that's family values," Mr. Clinton told the crowd in Chautauqua. "Unless we do a better job of lifting our people up, we're all going to be dragged down."
Winding up a three-day bus tour around the south shore of Lake Erie with his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, Mr. Clinton also responded sharply today to an assertion on Saturday by Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House minority whip, that the Democratic platform had a lot in common with the personal life of Woody Allen.
The film maker has acknowledged having an affair with an adopted daughter of his former lover, Mia Farrow.
 
'He Just Has No Shame'
 "That remark by Gingrich was off the wall and out of line and he just has no shame," Mr. Clinton said.
Asked whether he thought the comment by Mr. Gingrich, who was campaigning yesterday in the South with Mr. Bush, reflected the President's thinking, Mr. Clinton told reporters: "Of course it does. He was speaking for him and he picked him to speak."

HEADLINE: Tough Task Ahead in Beating Trial

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 23

 BODY:
The Federal Government plans to bring four Los Angeles police officers to trial next month for their roles in the beating of Rodney G. King, hoping to succeed where the State of California failed four months ago. But legal experts say the Federal prosecutors may have even more trouble winning convictions than the state did.
The Federal charges, which were brought this month, accuse the officers of depriving Mr. King of his civil rights when they beat and kicked him for 81 seconds on the night of March 3, 1991. The episode was captured on an amateur's videotape and provoked the nation's deadliest riot in this century after the officers were acquitted last April. The Federal trial is tentatively set for Sept. 29. 
 Difficult as it turned out to be to prove charges of assault in the first trial, experts caution that the Federal charges set an additional requirement: that the jury find that the officers knew they were using excessive and unnecessary force, that they intentionally broke the law.
 
'Very Tough to Prove'
 "What has to be shown is that they intended to deprive Rodney King of his constitutional rights," said Kim A. Taylor, a professor of law at Stanford University. "It's very tough to prove. Because of the bias most juries have in favor of police officers, unfortunately, I think it would be extremely surprising to me if there were a conviction."
The Justice Department loses about 25 percent of the official-misconduct civil rights cases it chooses to bring to trial out of hundreds of complaints it receives. The difficulty of proving criminal intent is one main reason.
"There is no magic formula," said a Federal law-enforcement official who said policy required that he not be quoted by name. "You can't read a person's mind. The jury is always instructed that you have to infer intent from the surrounding circumstances and the nature of the assault."
 
States Are High
 The stakes in the case are high following the violent reaction to the acquittal in the first trial. In the unexpected calm of what has turned into a hot and muggy summer, the city seems to be holding its breath as it awaits the start of the Federal trial.
All four policemen are white; Mr. King is black. Federal prosecutors began preparing their indictment, which makes no mention of a racial motive, after a jury of 10 whites, 1 Asian and 1 Hispanic member in suburban Simi Valley acquitted Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and Officers Laurence M. Powell, Timothy E. Wind and Theodore J. Briseno on April 29 of all but one count among charges of assault and use of excessive force.
Rioting swept Los Angeles after the acquittals, taking 51 lives, causing $850 million in damage and bringing a web of social tensions to the surface. Many community leaders say these tensions could boil over again if the four officers are acquitted a second time.
Mr. Wind, who was a rookie officer without tenure at the time of the beating, was dismissed from the police force. The other three men have been suspended without pay and are awaiting police department administrative hearings on their job status.
On Aug. 5 a Federal grand jury returned indictments that charge the three officers with violating Mr. King's Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable arrest. Sergeant Koon is charged with depriving him of his 14th Amendment right to due process of law for failing to restrain the officers. If convicted, each defendant faces up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
All four men pleaded not guilty on Aug. 10.
The start of the Federal case is expected to be delayed by legal maneuvers, including a defense request for a change of venue because of publicity.
Federal prosecutions that follow state court acquittals trouble some legal scholars, like Alan M. Dershowitz of Harvard Law School, who calls them "a second bite at the apple." But the Supreme Court has ruled that such cases do not constitute double jeopardy because of the separate jurisdictions of state and Federal courts.
 
A Close Legal Call
 Legal scholars say they can be difficult to win because defense lawyers are familiar with the witnesses and evidence and because juries can be influenced by the earlier acquittal.
And in cases involving specific intent, juries must make a close legal call. This difficulty is illustrated in the Justice Department's suggested language for a judge's instructions to a jury: "An act is done willfully if it is done voluntarily and intentionally and with the specific intent to do something the law forbids; that is, with an intent to violate a specific protected right."
In a case like this one, said Prof. Drew Days of Yale Law School: "There has to be some point at which one concludes that they have got beyond the point of effecting an arrest and have decided to become judge and jury on the spot. This is the source of additional pause on the part of jurors in trying to arrive at a decision."
Proof of intent almost always depends on circumstantial evidence, said Richard Cohen, legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which specializes in representing the victims of racial violence. "Typically, you look at people's conduct before and after the event," he said.
 
Pieces of Evidence
 The first trial in the beating, which came after Mr. King had been stopped for speeding, included several pieces of evidence that might be used now in an attempt to show the officers' intent.
These included police computer messages before the beating that appeared to involve racial slurs, a radio message afterward in which one of the police officers seems to be laughing about his actions, and a conversation where police officers jokingly say they "hit some home runs" during the beating.
If the Federal prosecutors can prove, as the state prosecutors failed to do, that the officers lied about the beating in their police reports, this would also suggest that they knew what they had done was wrong, Mr. Cohen said.
He said a prolonged beating, in this case 56 blows, also offered a better chance of conviction, suggesting that force continued beyond the point at which it was needed to complete an arrest. But in the first trial, defense lawyers apparently convinced the jury that Mr. King continued to provoke the blows as he rolled about on the ground. The officers asserted that they were following standard procedure in subduing an unruly suspect.
Many analysts say prosecutors in the first trial made a mistake in deciding not to call Mr. King to the witness stand, and he is expected to testify in the Federal trial. But some analysts are now warning that Mr. King, an unemployed construction worker with a criminal record, could present problems to the prosecution.

HEADLINE: Yugoslav-American in Belgrade Leads Serbs Who Won't Follow

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Since Milan Panic, a California millionaire, returned to his native Yugoslavia to assume the job of Prime Minister, he has vowed to end support for Serbs fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to allow observers to move freely through Yugoslav territory and to halt "ethnic cleansing," which he described in his inaugural address as "the disgrace of our nation."
But although Mr. Panic's words have been welcomed, he has been unable to keep his promises. Several programs have been blocked by Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia, the larger of the two republics that make up the truncated Yugoslav federation. Others have been sidetracked by members of Mr. Panic's Cabinet, some of whose members were imposed on him by Mr. Milosevic and the Yugoslav President, Dobrica Cosic.
 
Not Welcome at Peace Talks
 Despite Mr. Panic's efforts, the war in Bosnia is still raging, and foreign governments are tightening their sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
Some organizers of the peace conference that opens Wednesday in London are so skeptical of Mr. Panic's ability to influence events that they sought to exclude him. He finally won the right to attend, but as a private individual, because the conferees do not recognize the federal Government in Belgrade. The principal Serbian spokesman is likely to be Mr. Milosevic.
Mr. Panic's sharpest critics say he is allowing himself to be used by hard-liners like Mr. Milosevic, presenting a sympathetic face to the world while they quietly continue aiding Serbian fighters who are forcing thousands of Bosnians from their homes.
Those who sympathize with him urge that he be given more time to change a political culture where democracy is a new concept.
 
Behind on Points
 "He has raised hopes that with his American style, his optimism and his energy, he can get this country out from under the sanctions and wind the war down," said a foreign diplomat. "But in terms of clout and political power, he still has a long way to go. He's working in a field where he has no experience, and this is one of the biggest snake pits in the world."
Perhaps no European leader faces as daunting a challenge as that confronting the 63-year-old Mr. Panic (pronounced PAHN-itch). Yugoslavia has been blamed for triggering the savage war in Bosnia and has become an international pariah, choked by sanctions and convicted of brutal aggression in the court of world opinion.
Although Mr. Panic was still in California when Serbian leaders began their march into isolation, those who led the country into its current disaster are still in powerful positions. Chief among them is Mr. Milosevic, an unabashed Serbian nationalist who is widely viewed as Mr. Panic's principal rival. The two have built a fragile relationship, but devote much of their energy to outmaneuvering each other.
Thus far, Mr. Milosevic appears to have won most of these confrontations. He reportedly vetoed Mr. Panic's choice to head the foreign ministry, and has prevented the Panic Government from recognizing Croatia, which outsiders say it must do if it hopes to persuade the United Nations to lift economic sanctions.
Asked in an interview if Mr. Milosevic was his greatest problem, Mr. Panic smiled and replied, "I think he's Yugoslavia's problem."
 
Lazar the Loser (Gasp!)
 In his duels with Mr. Milosevic and his other adversaries, Mr. Panic relies principally on the colorful style that he developed during 30 years as a California entrepreneur.
That style was on full view Friday, when he appeared before Parliament to urge new steps toward peace. After deputies began to attack his proposals, he launched into a tirade that included ridicule of Serbia's most revered hero, Prince Lazar.
In the 14th century, Prince Lazar led his small Serbian force in a suicide attack against invading Turks. Generations of Serbs have honored him as a figure who chose to uphold the nation's dignity even at the price of death.
"That was a stupid fight," Mr. Panic told the stunned Parliament. "How can you glorify a defeat? You people here today are not just fighting the Turks, you are fighting the whole world," he exclaimed, his voice rising in controlled anger. "I will not accept that! We are not going to fight the world! We are going to make peace!"
When jeers began to rise from the assembly, Mr. Panic picked up a glass of water and shouted, "You don't think I'm a fighting Serb? Then I'll throw this glass in your face."
 
'Shock Therapy'
 Never having seen such conduct, many deputies began to laugh. Mr. Panic laughed with them, breaking the tension, and later several congratulated him.
"They needed that, they really did," Mr. Panic said later. "They need shock therapy. They are living in Disneyland. They're in the Twilight Zone."
Even his admirers are not sure Mr. Panic will be able to shake a nation that has been lost in almost suicidal fatalism since the days of Prince Lazar. Nearly everyone here, though, welcomes his upbeat enthusiasm.
"I see Mr. Panic as, first of all, different from what we have had," said Tibor Varad, a Harvard-trained lawyer and Mr. Panic's Minister of Justice. "His being here does not guarantee change, but it is a chance for change. He can't do everything at once, but we are in a position where many things need to be done at once. This is his predicament."
In his first six weeks in power, Mr. Panic has spent most of his time abroad, trying to convince foreign leaders that he is sincere in his campaign for peace. He has traveled to more than a dozen countries, and twice visited Sarajevo, the besieged capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 
Center Ring, or Sideshow?
 On his recent visit there two weeks ago, he failed to meet his adversaries, apparently because he had not arranged appointments. But his party was hit by sniper fire that killed an American journalist, leading some to suggest that Mr. Panic was endangering himself and those around him by taking trips that had more publicity value than political effect.
Many diplomats in Belgrade are convinced there can be no real progress toward peace while Mr. Milosevic is in power. Acutely aware of that sentiment, Mr. Panic is trying to find a way to ease the President of Serbia out.
He has directed the Justice Ministry to draw up a plan for early elections; Mr. Milosevic might choose not to run, or might be defeated if he chose to become a candidate. But Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party, successor to the Communists, controls Parliament and has thus far blocked any elections.
"Mr. Panic came here as a kind of messiah, or at least he was announced as one," said Vuk Draskovic, leader of the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement. "He asked 100 days to end the war, lift the sanctions and set the stage for what he called American democracy. But almost 50 days have passed, and Mr. Panic has done nothing to loosen the noose.
"Bonn or London or New York are not to blame for the sanctions. Belgrade is responsible for them, Mr. Milosevic and his Government are responsible. He is the world's most hated man, and as long as he is in office, there will be no progress and no lifting of sanctions. If Mr. Panic is able to remove him, then all of us in the democratic opposition will cheer. But so far he is not strong enough to do it."
 
From $20 to Drug Entrepreneur
 Although he considers himself a "patriotic Yugoslav," Mr. Panic has been much shaped by his life in the United States. Reflecting his mixed background, he speaks English with a Balkan accent and Serbo-Croatian with an American accent.
The Serbian-born Mr. Panic, who in his youth was a Yugoslav cycling champion, emigrated to the United States in 1956, arriving in New York with "two suitcases and $20," according to his official biography. He made his way to California, and in 1960 founded ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., which grew into a multimillion-dollar company based in Costa Mesa, Calif.
His business career has been marred by legal trouble. In 1991 his company paid $600,000 in costs and penalties after the Food and Drug Administration charged that ICN had misrepresented the medicinal qualities of a drug called Virazole. The company had described the drug as an AIDS treatment.
Mr. Panic is currently facing charges of defaulting on an $8.4 million loan he assumed when he bought a California motel in 1985, as well as charges that he owes real estate taxes on another motel.
 
A Man of Money
 Some ICN shareholders complained when it was disclosed that Mr. Panic took salary and compensation worth more than $6 million in 1991. The company's profit that year was only $5.8 million, but Mr. Panic defended his earnings by saying he had taken steps that would bring far greater profits.
Mr. Panic has been a generous donor to political causes, favoring liberal Democrats and especially the former California Governor, Edmund G. Brown Jr. But he is also an active backer of the conservative Freedom Foundation, which is supported by Associate Justice Antonin Scalia and a former delegate to the United Nations, Jeane Kirkpatrick.
After making a series of speeches in recent years to business and scientific groups in Yugoslavia, Mr. Panic emerged as an intriguing local personality. Several months ago, as the country was plunging into its current abyss, Mr. Cosic, the President of Yugoslavia, telephoned him and asked him to return and lead the Government.
Mr. Panic received a special waiver from the Treasury Department allowing him to work in a country that was under United Nations sanctions, and assurances from the State Department that he would not be stripped of his United States citizenship. He was inaugurated on July 14.
 
Out of Control
 Sitting on a sofa at the Belgrade mansion where he now lives (his family has remained in California), Mr. Panic said much of the violence in Bosnia is being perpetrated by bands beyond the control of Serbian, Muslim or Croatian leaders.
"At first I thought those three leaders were three crooks," he said. "Now I believe that they may not be the most decent human beings, but they are not directing this war. There are 1,200 or 2,000 really bad guys out there who are responsible for most of these atrocities you hear about. They are called paramilitary, but they are really just terrorists."
Some commentators here predict Mr. Panic will not survive more than a few months as Prime Minister, and he does not expect to stay for more than two years. In that time, he said, Yugoslavs should be able to learn the rudiments of democracy.
"If I talk to you in Chinese and you don't understand, that doesn't mean you are not intelligent," he said. "It just means that you haven't had a chance to learn Chinese. That's the way it is here with democracy. I have to start with lesson one. But we are making progress toward democracy, and progress toward peace. If people pray for me, I think we can succeed."

HEADLINE: Voices of Stoicism, Fear and Revelry As Many Prepare to Ride Out Storm

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Shortly before noon, with the sun still shining brightly but with reports of the approach of Hurricane Andrew beginning to throb with urgency, Karen Madsen drew the drapes, shut off the electricity and said goodbye to her waterfront condo here.
Like most of the other residents in her six-building complex overlooking Biscayne Bay, Ms. Madsen, a 46-year-old banker, had not installed storm shutters and said she had no way to board up the huge plate-glass windows that give her fourth-floor apartment a spellbinding marine panorama. 
 "I just have to hope for the best," she said as she checked into a hotel on the edge of Miami International Airport where the loading ramps were jammed and airline officials said every flight out was booked solid.
 
Stoicism and Daring
 As the most powerful hurricane in years bore down on the glistening, glass-encased hotel and office towers, the mansions and the simple sunbaked homes of Miami, residents and visitors turned to face the story each in his own way.
Everyone was at least a little apprehensive. Some were terrified. Some were stoic, fatalistic. Some laughed at the danger.
Many took the advice of the authorities and headed for shelter well away from the magnificent waters that embrace the city.
But throughout the vast evacuation zone from the Florida Keys to well north of Miami, many others said they would ride out the storm no matter what anyone told them.
James L. Greenhill, an 87-year-old lawyer who has undergone several hip operations, said he did not want to leave his third-floor apartment and could not even if he wanted to.
"I can't even move without those damn things," he said, gesturing contemptuously toward a pair of spindly alloy walkers.
"I'm staying," Mr. Greenhill said firmly. "I don't know where the hell to go. The shelters are awful."
His wife, Doris, who had set out kerosene lamps and flashlights and was boiling a batch of eggs, offered no dissent. "If the house goes," she said, "we go. I hope it is not painful."
 
Stuck in the Keys
 In Key West, many tourists who were unable to get away on commercial or chartered flights tried to hire taxis to drive them to Miami, 164 miles to the northeast, but found no takers. "It's an eight-hour drive to Miami, and we may get stuck on a bridge," said Morgan Haas, a cab driver.
Actually, the trip to Miami was taking about five hours by late afternoon, Monroe County emergency officials said. Normally, the drive is about three hours.
Joe Morgan, a Key West bartender, said he would rather stay home than risk getting caught in heavy traffic. "Just think," he said, "there are other islands, and we're at the end."
Mr. Morgan and his friend Don Kissee were stocking up with 10 gallons water, rice, beans and, Mr. Kissee said, "Don't forget the two cases of Red Stripe beer."
 
A Run on Supplies
 Toward evening, most of the South Florida gas stations and hardware stores and pharmacies and groceries that had been mobbed since midnight Saturday had shut down, their owners and employees gone off to take care of themselves and their families.
But in the island community of North Bay Village, halfway between Miami and Miami Beach in Biscayne Bay, clerks at the big, pink-trimmed Woolley's Supermarket, a new local chain that has aggressively going after sales in these recessionary times with a 24-hour operation, were still ringing up sales from a few stragglers who ducked through a narrow opening in the stainless-steel window coverings.
At Woolley's, like most other stores by now, there was plenty of fresh produce, but the bread shelves and all the bottled water and whole sections of canned goods were gone.
So were all the flashlight batteries.
Michael Campbell, a physical education teacher who moved from Newark almost exactly a year ago for the "nice weather" and now picks up extra money as a part-time stock clerk, said a lot of people at Woolley's and other stores where he had stopped for storm supplies had attacked the shelves "as if the end of the world was coming."
"People were bumping and shoving," Mr. Campbell said. "I reached for a roll of masking tape at a discount store and a woman physically pushed me out of the way as if I was reaching for money. I took a roll and gave her one. Pathetic."
 
Teak Protection
 At the Shell Lumber and Hardware Store in Coconut Grove this afternoon, more than 50 people waited to buy sheets of plywood to board up their windows. Some had been waiting for hours.
Griffith Pitcher, a lawyer, said he said he was concerned that the lumber yard was increasing its prices throughout the afternoon. Original plywood prices quoted at around $22 had moved up $40 as he was waiting, he said.
A salesman, Herb Cilio, confirmed that the price had risen but said it was because the store had run through the cheaper stocks of plywood by early this morning. By afternoon, he said, the only supplies left were of red oak, mahogany and teak.
At the Publix Supermarket in Coconut Grove, Ivette Abreu, a 16-year-old working on the cash register, said crowds were so bad in the morning that managers often had to lock the doors.
 
Making Room for Guests
 By early evening, few cars were on the streets. By dusk, most of whatever was going on was going on inside.
At the University of Miami's School of Medicine, guards went from floor to floor unlocking doors to private offices that were being converted into temporary shelters for friends, family members and others who had no other place to go.
Though the building usually has about 50 guards and other staff on Sunday evenings, a guard said more than 200 people were there tonight. Most arrived carrying pillows, bags of food and radios.
At the curb in front of Woolley's, Shanna Ochery, a 29-year-old unemployed cocktail waitress, and Michael Swift, a 38-year-old hotel pool attendant from New London, Conn., were sitting in Ms. Ochery's faded 1983 Le Baron Chrysler convertible with the top down. They were wishing that their friend James Roberts, a 35-year-old aviation mechanic who lost his job when Pan American World Airways went bankrupt, would hurry with the beer.
"We're going to have three cases of beer and a couple watermelons," Mr. Swift said. "We've got a first-floor apartment over on the water. We figure this thing is going to hit pretty hard. But we're going to ride it out."
Ms. Ochery, who said she has lived in Miami for years, said she was not nervous. "No," she said. "I've never been in a hurricane before." She tossed her platinum ponytail and a laugh creased her deep tan. "Hey," she said, "you gotta die sometime. It can't be that bad."
 
'It's My Property'
 David Fugatt, who served with the Marines in Vietnam, said everything he had was tied up in his sprawling waterfront home and the adjoining set of apartments. "They'd better be ready to arrest me," he said of the police. "I'm not going." He was paying for 10 cans of food for his two cats. He had already provisioned his 52 exotic birds.
Sure, Mr. Fugatt said, he was tempting fate. "But," he said simply but unequivocally, "it's my property. I've got to protect it."
Munsey Goldstein who is 75 years old and retired from the liquor business in Baltimore, was not nearly so determined. He and his wife, Lily, had wrapped their treasured paintings in towels and clothing and placed them on high closet shelves. Then they packed overnight bags and headed for a hotel, leaving their house with its big picture windows, standing on a spit between the ocean and the bay, to confront the storm as best it could.
"We didn't board up," he said. "We couldn't do that ourselves."
"I'm very nervous," Mr. Goldstein said, but he was not too nervous to remember to brag about his son, the jazz musician, who lives in New York and makes a lot of money, he said, ghost writing scores for big names in the movie business.
"First, there's the heavy rain," Mr. Goldstein said. "Even a heavy downpour clogs the street drains. So I'm afraid of the water. And the flying objects that can break windows. And then we're afraid of robberies. They wait for times like this. And we've got tremendous trees two, three stories tall. Wouldn't you be worried?"

Markets
President Bush appears to have written off the dollar for now. If it falls, even from the all-time low it reached on Friday against the German mark, so be it, as long as the swoon is slow and orderly. The decision does not mean that the Administration would tolerate a sudden, steep plunge. And it carries risks that could unnerve both the bond and stock markets. [Page D1.]
The mark's strength is forcing Britain to confront its most painful lesson yet about the costs of economic integration with the Continent. And with the pound, like the dollar, plunging in value, London stands at the brink of being forced to prop up its currency. Any further drop could, in fact, force Prime Minister Major to raise interest rates at a time of recession. [D1.]
 
The Economy
 Among many economists who shape the strategies of banks and investment houses, patience with the President ended with his speech last week. The very highlight of his plan -- offsetting cuts in taxes and spending -- was widely denounced in interviews as poison for an economy in a joyless, jobless recovery. [D1.] 
 Some economists are beginning to smell a whiff of deflation, a decline in the overall level of prices. Yet nobody sees much chance that full-fledged deflation will occur. [D2.]
The Administration has drafted a broad plan that sets new priorities for the Government's biomedical research efforts. [A1.]
 
International
Japan's most famous personal computer entrepreneur is in the midst of a fight to save his company from bankruptcy. Kazuhiko Nishi's problems are typical of those afflicting Japanese businesses as the country's speculative boom has come to a halt. [D1.]
A year after being named chairman of Argentina's securities commission, Martin Redrado shows signs of strain. [D3.]
 
Companies
 LSI Logic says it will take a restructuring charge of up to $110 million and lay off about 450 employees. [D2.]
A longtime Digital executive, F. Grant Saviers, has joined Adaptec as president and chief operating officer. [D2.]
 
The Media Business
Summer TV has a successful look this year. At least four series introduced as summer entries, and perhaps more, have scored well enough to receive orders for new episodes, guaranteeing that this will be the first strong crop of shows ever introduced in the summer months. Bill Carter: Television. [D1.]
GQ defied the odds and now leads a British market for men's general-interest magazines. Although Esquire, which started its British edition in February 1991, is seeking to challenge that market, success has remained elusive so far. [D6.]
A "tolerable loss" is how NBC executives describe the results of the network's investment in the 1992 Summer Olympics. [D6.]
The decline of Pulitzer's chain of community weeklies in Chicago's suburbs could be a harbinger of the 90's for similar small newspaper groups that sprang up around many cities. [D6.]
A burst of activity has belied the notion that nothing happens in advertising in August. Shearson Lehman Brothers parted ways with Chiat/Day/Mojo, and executives of Leo Burnett U.S.A. and DDB Needham New York visited Fruit of the Loom in connection with an account review. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D7.]
The Harvard Business School is expected to name a new publisher of the Harvard Business Review soon, and it appears close to filling the top editorial job at the magazine. [D6.]
 
Today's Column
A cooler summer has meant fewer parched throats, and that has frustrated many businesses. Foremost among the disappointed, perhaps, are aluminum companies, which supply the raw material for soft-drink and beer cans. Market Place. [D4.]

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Voters;
Some Ohioans Finding No Easy Political Home

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LORAIN, Ohio, Aug. 22

 BODY:
Spirits were high at the Great Tomato Weigh-In and Festival here the other day. With the sun shining, the soda cold and a gentle breeze off Lake Erie rustling the trees, it was just about a perfect day, said Priscilla Davis. Then the subject of the Presidential campaign came up.
"They both stink," the 36-year-old part-time bank teller said of President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. "There's too much dirt being dug up on each candidate that has nothing to do with the election or the lives of real people. They don't care about us, and they don't know anything about family values. What does politics have to do with it?" 
 She stalked off, but after a few feet whirled and said: "The more I think about this mess, the madder I get. Some choice."
Ohio is considered to be one of the pivotal battle grounds in this fall's campaign. And as hopeful gardeners brought their prize tomatoes to be weighed at the festival 30 miles west of Cleveland, Governor Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, were stating a bus caravan across the state to rally support.
But for many in this tired but proud city, the rallying calls of both parties sound hollow.
If this part of Middle America is also Skeptical America, the people in Lorain have earned their skepticism the old-fashioned way: it was given to them, one disappointment at a time. Many said they had heard too many political apologies and promises before.
"I'm for George Bush all the way, but I think he really messed up with that 'No new taxes' stuff," said Jim Trinter, who is 36 and an out of work restaurant manager. "He let the people down."
The 71,000 people of Lorain have been let down for at least 10 years. Thousands of jobs have been lost to plant closings or relocations. Crime is up. The schools are financially strapped and the young pack up and escape as soon as they can because the future looks brighter almost anywhere but in Lorain, a once-booming steel mill and ship-building center.
"We have five children, and they couldn't find anything around here," said Therese Francis, 66. "Any college graduate has to leave town to find a job. Now, that really impacts family values."
The voices of the people here are uncertain, angry and fed-up. But they are also voices of hope, humor and determination that things are going to get better, because, as one woman put it, "they can't get any worse."
 
The Economy Is the Issue
 The major issue for many here is the economy and getting people back to work. People said the issues of family values, character and leadership, although important and much talked about at the national conventions, take a back seat to the economy and who can fix it.
"Family values is not going to take care of our economy," said Jose Ortiz, 35, as he loaded wallboard into a van to make extra money constructing an addition to a house. "I think we need a change. Before they had steady jobs. Now you're hustling. Whatever job that comes up, you try to grab it."
On the South Side of Lorain, Edward Guggenbiller, 33, and his wife, Melody, 30, were busy painting their single-story house on Saturday. He works as a landscaper; she is employed as an accountant for a brass and bronze casting company. They consider themselves middle class but struggle to make ends meet.
"The middle class is going to hurt if Bush is re-elected," Mrs. Guggenbiller said. "We're for Clinton."
But not everyone is having that hard a time, even in Lorain.
Not far away, the shrill of a referee's whistle pierced the morning air as the boys from Southview High School met the Keystone High School boys in a football scrimmage. It was the Saints vs. the Wildcats in a preseason workout game.
Vaughn Zajicek, 37, and his wife, Yolanda, 35, were watching their son, Vaughn, play tight end. Mr. Zajicek, a former steel worker who now works as a safety director for a trucking company, said he is voting for President Bush without hesitation.
"I've been working since the Republicans have been in," he said. "I'm better off now than I was four years ago. I was getting back on my feet in the Reagan Administration, and with the Bush Administration, I'm doing very well. I'll take that into consideration more than anything else."
 
Idealism Ends With Age
 The mood here seems to mirror recent polls showing the President doing best among men, while more women perfer Mr. Clinton. Several of the men here said they were once young Democrats but are now older and wiser Republicans, a maturation that they said began with the election of Ronald Reagan.
They are men like Kirk Knisely, 33, the head lifeguard at Lorain's Lakeview Park who is a special education teacher for the city's schools. As sailboats eased arcoss the lake, Mr. Knisely said he was a Democrat but lost his idealism when he graduated from college. He is voting for Mr. Bush.
"I see all kinds of messed up kids as a result of dysfunctional families, with lousy familial values," he said. "If there were more good-paying jobs, that would go a long way in helping families develop good family values. I think everything revolves around the economy. When people are working and making money, a lot of these other questions are moot."
Many here are still on the fence, one week leaning toward Mr. Clinton and his talk of change, and the next week or even day tipping toward Mr. Bush and his talk of experience on the world stage.
The night before President Bush addressed his convention, the home of Dwight and Therese Francis was a house divided.
Mr. Francis, 64, a retired steel worker, buys an American car almost every other year because, he said, "I worked in a steel mill for 41 years; if I buy a foreign car, I'd be turning my back on everything I am."
Mr. Francis is voting for Mr. Bush.
His wife was leaning toward Mr. Clinton because she believed the country needed a change, the economy needed a fresh start. But after watching the Republican convention and especially Barbara Bush's speech about her husband, Mrs. Francis has changed her mind.
"The way she described her husband, I decided that he was a pretty good man," Mrs. Francis said. "I'm leaning toward Bush now. But that could change."
Back at the Great Tomato Weigh-In, the weighing was still a few hours away when Mary Hress, 68, and her daughter, Adrienne Terleck, 40, began setting up a table to sell homemade pot holders and towels on the lawn of the Autumn Aegis Nursing Home. The tomato festival was helping raise money for the home.
Mrs. Hress said she was a lifelong Democrat and would support Mr. Clinton. Mrs. Terleck, a public school teacher in Lorain, said the first time she voted for President, it was for Richard M. Nixon.
And that was the last time she voted for a Republican, she said.
"I think Bush is a good man, but he's not for the middle class," she said. "The way government can help improve family values is to encourage day care on the job and equal pay for women. I think Clinton will be better at that."
Mrs. Terleck looked over at her mother and smiled.
"Our country is like one big, broken family and it needs to be put back together," Mrs. Terleck said. "We need a woman President to put our house in order."

HEADLINE: EAST HAMPTON JOURNAL;
What If They Built a Ferry to the Hamptons and People Came?

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON

DATELINE: EAST HAMPTON, L.I.

 BODY:
WHEN Jennifer Quinn plans her weekends, she takes any ferryboat she can find.
"I've been to Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and Block Island this summer, and if I could take a ferry directly to the Hamptons, that would be fantastic," she said Friday, standing at the Orient Point ferry terminal at the eastern tip of Long Island's North Fork. "Where do I sign?" 
 Ms. Quinn, a 28-year-old computer programmer from Boston, shifted her beach gear from one arm to the other and added her name to a petition calling for year-round car ferry service from New London, Conn., to the Hamptons on the South Fork.
The proposal has been welcomed by much of the business community in the Hamptons, stung by the recession and a rainy summer season, but rejected by many long-term summer residents who envision hordes of day-trippers disturbing what's left of a gentle sun-and-surf life style in the seaside villages in East Hampton and Southampton.
"With all that ferry traffic, I'd never be able to get across the street," said Gary Brennan, 48, a writer who has been summering in East Hampton for 16 years. "If I want gridlock, I can stay in Manhattan," he added, juggling his morning newspaper, coffee, blueberry muffin and the bumper-to-bumper traffic on Main Street.
After Ms. Quinn made her return trip reservation at Orient Point for Sunday evening, she joined a carload of friends for the hourlong drive to the South Fork and the beach at Southampton, as did many of the passengers in the cars rolling off the 9 A.M. boat from New London.
With the prospect of more time on the beach and less time on a crowded road, more than 17,000 New London-to-Orient Point ferry passengers have signed similar petitions, said Richard MacMurray, the general manager of the Cross Sound Ferry Service, which would like to open the new ferry line across Long Island Sound, through Block Island Sound directly to the Hamptons.
"We're testing the waters," he said. "And if enough people want it, we'll try to make it happen."
Mr. MacMurray would like to build a new ferry terminal several minutes east of East Hampton at Promised Land, a part of Napeague State Park on Napeague Bay. The site is now a dilapidated fish processing factory.
A recent poll of almost 300 members of the East Hampton Chamber of Commerce found that among the 100 who responded, the ferry plan was favored by a four-to-one ratio. As a result, the business group has asked the town board to seriously consider the idea, despite the strong opposition from many local residents.
"The main objections are environmental," said Joan McKenna, a writer who lives in East Hampton Beach, just down the road from the proposed ferry landing. "Napeague Bay has some of the cleanest water in the area, and a ferry would only create problems, not solve any."
Tony Bullock, a Democrat and Supervisor of the Town of East Hampton, said the town board had already passed a resolution expressing no interest in the ferry. He said the Promised Land site was state-protected wetlands with a road system "that can hardly handle a golf cart, let alone a tractor-trailer."
"I just don't see any crying need to bring more cars in here in the summer. It would be handy for some residents who visit New England on a regular year-round basis, but we don't need the added public safety problems of crowd control, idling engines and beer bottles on an already fragile peninsula."
However, Fred W. Thiele Jr., a Republican and Supervisor of the Town of Southampton, said he would like to study the idea. "It's been a difficult few years for the tourism industry, and a ferry might help."
State Assemblyman John L. Behan, a Republican from Montauk, said he had yet to see any official plans or proposals for the project.
"There's nothing I can sit down and look at, so there's no point in my taking sides," he said. "Right now it all looks like a pie-in-the-sky thing."
Mr. Behan, whose father once operated a ferry service to Block Island and Newport, said he had talked with Mr. MacMurray and with the state's Park Department officials. "And it's my strong understanding that the state is not interested at this point," he said.
Mr. MacMurray said he would not approach the state unless he was certain there was enough public demand for the ferry service. If he did, he said he would limit the service to smaller boats that carry no more than 24 cars a trip, or around 200 cars a day.
He said the fare would be a few dollars more than the $27 per car for the hour-and-a-half ride from New London to Orient Point. A trip to the Promised Land terminal would add about 20 minutes to the ferry ride.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
For Misplaced Students, Special Education Can Disable, Too

BYLINE: By Joseph Berger

 BODY:
MARGARITA OTERO PARKER has seen both her sons labeled handicapped by New York City's school bureaucracy, and she cannot understand why.
These young men, who live on the Lower East Side, are not blind, retarded or crippled, yet because of sporadic misbehavior, both were classified as emotionally disturbed. That is a catch-all that sweeps in everyone from psychotics to class clowns who irritate their teachers once too often. 
 But once consigned to so-called special education classes, students like Mrs. Parker's sons often find themselves in a Kafkaesque cul-de-sac, virtually never escaping. Mrs. Parker's eldest, Julio Otero, now 22 years old, so despaired of the dull and juvenile classes he attended that he dropped out after the 10th grade.
His brother, Christopher Parker, a tall 14-year-old with lively green eyes and a talent for drawing cartoons, has been chafing in most of his classes since the third grade.
"They don't teach you nothing in this classroom," he says, confirming that, for one thing, he has not mastered grammar.
Actually, he complains, he is required to spend too much time out of the classroom, visiting guidance counselors and tutors, going to work programs at a bicycle shop, taking trips to museums or to a pizza parlor. In his rough way, he suggests, he feels patronized by all this "babywork." All he craves is to sit in a real classroom, to hear a spirited lesson.
Thousands of the genuinely handicapped belong in special classes. But too often, critics say, assignment there is not driven by a handicap, but by money and expedience.
The Board of Education likes the classification because it can collect Federal and state money to pay for small classes and teachers and counselors it otherwise cannot afford. (A disabled child's schooling costs $17,000 a year, almost three times as much as a mainstream child.) The school unions like it because, even in threadbare budgets, teachers must be hired for the handicapped.
The special-education juggernaut has channeled one of every eight New York children -- 123,000 in all -- into handicapped classes, more than double the 1979 figure. Yet 75 percent fall into two amorphous categories -- learning disabled and emotionally disturbed.
Elizabeth C. Yeampierre, executive director of Advocates for Children, a nonprofit group that handles 1,500 special education complaints a year, says most placements make no sense. Why else, she asks, would so disproportionate a number of Hispanic children, whose real handicap is not being able to speak English, be labeled learning disabled, and so many poor young black males be labeled emotionally disturbed?
Frank Sobrino, a board spokesman, declined to discuss Christopher's case, citing confidentiality. But other officials said that Christopher was regularly found to be disturbed by three-member teams of psychologists, social workers and teachers who gave him batteries of tests.
Children in the program do not have much use for such euphemisms. They call those in classes for the learning disabled stupid and those in classes for the emotionally disturbed bad. While such judgments are harsh, they are also perversely savvy. For as Ms. Yeampierre and the board's own studies have shown, special education is too often a "dumping ground" for laggard readers or unruly students.
Defenders of special education say that it is often the only way to provide children like Christopher with the small classes and counseling that they need. But Mrs. Parker, who works for the Housing Authority, says that the annoying tradeoff is that Christopher is now stigmatized as emotionally disturbed. Yet Christopher, she says, has never done anything more bizarre than get into a street fight.
To be sure, Christopher is no angel. Warren Parker, a recently unemployed warehouse manager, says his son is a restless boy with a low flashpoint who has lashed out at teachers. In fact, Mr. Parker suggests, his son is a chip off the old block. And he said his own teachers, in the plainer language of the day, branded him a punk, not emotionally disturbed.
Christopher sat calmly through an hourlong interview with a reporter, showing off a mostly lucid three-page story he had written called "Dungeons and Dragons," complete with illustrations and maps.
If Christopher is truly disturbed, the law still requires schools to move him into mainstream classes with dispatch. But only 5 percent of those in special education ever get out, mostly because they fall behind academically.
In fact, Christopher has been in handicapped classes so long that, even if he is transferred to mainstream Seward Park High School, he is apprehensive about whether he can do the work. For him, the handicapped classification may have become self-fulfilling.

HEADLINE: Where Office Buildings Were Planted, Doubts Now Grow

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Aug. 22

 BODY:
For 30 years this mid-Westchester city has been rebuilding itself into what some said was a prototype of the modern suburban center.
But now, in a city where heavy traffic roars past towering office buildings and a jumbo mall but where there is no longer a single movie theater, some here are saying they are not sure they like what they have created. 
 "We do more than work," said Rita Malmud, the chairwoman of the Downtown Revitalization Task Force, formed by White Plains this spring. "We do more than shop. We also have a life after 5 P.M."
The doubts about the choices White Plains made were brought sharply into focus by a recent report by a commercial real-estate brokerage and consulting company. During years of redevelopment, more than half of the downtown was bulldozed for urban renewal. Office buildings were favored for that empty space. But now, the report found, 27 percent of the prime commercial space in White Plains' central business district is vacant.
While some, including Mayor Alfred Del Vecchio, blame the recession, others think the vacancy rate reveals deeper problems with the direction of White Plains' growth.
The report, by Rostenberg Doern Company, said that White Plains, along with St. Louis and Miami, had the highest office vacancy rate of 34 major business centers studied across the country.
Planning experts and others said the office vacancy problem raised fundamental questions not only about White Plains but also about many of New York's other satellite cities, like Stamford, Conn., and New Brunswick, N.J., and about suburban centers across the country that have been shaped by similar development forces.
 
'This Empty Feeling'
 "The great difficulty for the regional centers -- and White Plains epitomizes it as much as anywhere else -- is that everyone has this empty feeling about the regional downtowns," said Richard Anderson, who was until this summer president of the Regional Plan Association, a planning group for the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut area.
Until the current recession, office construction was seen as the magic bullet of urban redevelopment in places like this city of 48,000. Largely because of office buildings built since the 1970's, White Plains' daytime population, according to city officials, swells to some 250,000.
But in a common pattern in suburban centers, even in good economic times, many of those office workers do not stray far from their office buildings during the day, and most of them go right home at night.
No one can prove which is the cause and which the effect, but modern suburban centers are often antiseptic, car-oriented places rather than cities with individual character, said Peter Mosbacher, the executive director of the New York Main Street Alliance, a private group that helps communities revitalize their business districts. "They've become 9-to-5, Monday-to-Friday office centers," said Mr. Mosbacher.
White Plains' predicament seems a particular irony because the city, the Westchester County seat, was among the most forceful suburban centers in the New York area in trying to reinvent itself. In the 1960's, it paved the way for an unprecedented renewal when it bulldozed 135 acres of its downtown, more than half of the 250 acres in the central business district, although it left such old streets as Mamaroneck Avenue untouched.
 
Mayor Redevelopment
 When the offices were filled and new projects were on the drawing boards, it was not popular to raise questions about the shape of the new White Plains. Mr. Del Vecchio, the outspoken longtime Mayor, a former Democrat and current Republican, is more identified with the transformation than any other public figure.
This week Mayor Del Vecchio, who likes to say he has been "thrown out of three of the four political parties" because of his strongly held views, angrily dismissed the reports of a high vacancy rate as a "numbers game." And he said in an interview that there was nothing wrong with White Plains that an economic recovery would not fix.
"We did a billion dollars worth of construction in 10 years, and it was a tremendous success," he said. "The present setback will be taken care of as soon as we get an upturn."
But others wonder whether the vacancy rate highlights an assumption that crept into planning during good economic times -- that the city merely needed to be hospitable to developers and the quality of life would take care of itself. "We were," said Ms. Malmud, "built on the premise that everything would be expanding and that things would be glorious."
That helped obscure the fact, she said, that the new city being constructed here lacked the amenities and attractions that typically draw people to cities. Historically, because of local opposition, cabaret licenses have been difficult to get here, essentially depriving White Plains of a night life. There are few restaurants or galleries that draw in the evening hours, and there is no longer a single supermarket, complain Mayor Del Vecchio's critics.
White Plains' main retail street, Mamaroneck Avenue, was once dotted with so many fine stores that it was known as "little Fifth Avenue." These days it has a vacancy rate of about 30 percent, and there are so many close-out and cut-rate stores that, according to one local barb, it is a challenge to spend more than a dollar on the street that once was home to establishments like Bonwit Teller, gone now from the retailing scene altogether.
The Galleria Mall, a 150-store project built in the heart of the renewal zone during the 1970's, has been criticized as an architectural fortress cut off from the city that discourages pedestrian traffic and helped speed the decline of Mamaroneck Avenue, one block away.
All of this city's experience, Ms. Malmud said, suggests that White Plains needs to re-evaluate its commitment to offices and the kinds of stores that are at home in the mall.
But there are some who worry that the patterns that led to the current situation are simply being repeated. Mary Ann Keenan, the Democratic president of the White Plains Common Council, said the city never stopped to evaluate what kind of place it was creating as one heady project after another got under way. And she said there are signs that, even with the high office vacancy rate, little has changed.
Mayor Del Vecchio and his advisers, Ms. Keenan said, were influenced by their affection for development. They would talk, she said, about wanting people on the streets of the city at the same time they were mapping out six-lane streets through the heart of the redeveloped zone.
 
His Views Are Unaltered
 Mayor Del Vecchio defends his development policies, attributing the current problems to politics and to local entrepreneurs who failed to attract people. In an interview this week, he echoed traditional views of suburbia, saying, "If you want a play or the arts, you have to go downtown" -- by which, he said, he meant New York City.
And he assailed critics as Johnnie-come-latelies who were not around during the difficult days when it was hard to imagine a city where there were only acres of cleared land.
"The decisions we made were the right decisions," he said. "In 20-20 hindsight, they say we should have done something different. Where were they then?"
Ms. Keenan said the questions being asked these days are not just about the past. With the office buildings a quarter empty and the main shopping street suffering, she said, the city is still working hard to encourage developers of two new malls on the sites of defunct department stores in central White Plains.
Three major office building projects that would add more office space than the 1.57 million square feet that is currently vacant have their city approvals. Those projects are awaiting only better economic conditions before construction is expected to begin. Once again, Ms. Keenan said, there seems to be a belief that whatever the problem is, it can be fixed by construction.
"For three years," Ms. Keenan said, "I've been saying, 'How much is too much?' And everyone just looks at me, and the developers say, 'Mary Ann, you can't stop now.' I say, 'Why can't we stop now?' "

HEADLINE: Economists Skeptical Of Tax Plan

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Maybe George Bush is a Republican, maybe he did run his own business, and maybe he does want to treat Wall Street to a cut in the capital gains tax. But among many of the economists who shape the strategies of the nation's banks and investment houses, patience with the President ended with his speech last week.
The very highlight of his plan -- offsetting cuts in taxes and spending -- was widely denounced as poison for an economy in a joyless, jobless recovery. "Almost every economist would agree that equal cuts in taxes and spending actually depress the economy," said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company. "It is not a growth program." 
 The financial community's economists do not exactly feel betrayed by President Bush; it is not as if he called for a tax on securities trading to help finance food stamps. They are just deeply disappointed.
 
'A Vote of No Confidence'
 The disappointment with a President seemingly made to Wall Street's measure runs so deep that not even the brightening of his political prospects now brings the financial community much cheer.
Edward A. Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, said that some are wondering just how much worse a Clinton Presidency could be. "The conventional wisdom is that Wall Street prefers Bush to Clinton," he said. "But the deficit expanded to all-time records under Bush. You could argue that a Democrat couldn't have done any worse.
"If you look at the vote today in the financial markets, it was a vote of no confidence," he said on Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average sank 50.79 points, to a four-month low of 3,254.10, on Friday.
Neal M. Soss, chief economist at First Boston, is among those who worry that the President is simply grasping for political gains. "These proposals don't have much content, but to the extent they do, they are impractical or unlikely of adoption," he said. "On the other hand, they may make attractive political promises."
Not that Wall Street is rushing to embrace Bill Clinton. Mr. Soss fears that the candidates will merely compete in offering budgetary blandishments. "So maybe you're in a bidding war on fiscal policy, which sends interest rates up," he said.
 
Applause, and Skepticism
 Some features of the Bush plan did find favor -- caps on spending for entitlement programs especially. But controlling Government spending depends on limiting payments for Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, farm subsidies and veterans' benefits, Mr. Sinai said. "It's courageous and politically difficult," he said. "All of us who for years have worried about the deficit would have to applaud."
Mr. Bush's proposal for letting voters earmark as much as 10 percent of their tax payments for deficit reduction met with skepticism, however, as economists questioned whether Federal bookkeepers would reduce spending accordingly.
"It does not change whatsoever the flow of revenues to the Government's coffers," said Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley. "Does that reduce the deficit? It's an open question."
 
'Banana Republic Status'
 Among academic economists, Paul Krugman, an economist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has consulted for the Clinton campaign, began his review of the Bush speech with a dismissive chuckle. "He's for cutting wasteful Government spending, but not any particular spending," he said. "If it's going to be real tax cuts and fictitious spending cuts, then we could be well on our way to banana republic status."
Many other economists have in recent months urged higher public spending, even at the cost of a wider deficit, to revive the economy. Robert Solow, also at M.I.T., helped persuade more than 70 of his colleagues to sign an open letter to that effect in March. The President's call for reduced spending only confirmed his lack of interest in restarting the economy, Mr. Solow said. "You could never tell from the speech that we're in a recession that doesn't want to end," he added.
Most economists say that cutting taxes and spending equally depresses the economy. Taxpayers save some of the extra money, failing to fully compensate for the Government spending that is lost.
But other economists, including Milton Friedman, say that the President's spending cuts could actually stimulate the economy. "Whether you finance it by taxes or borrowing, there's that much left for the private sector," said Mr. Friedman, who is now at Stanford's Hoover Institution. But with Congress apt to spend as much as it can, he said, "The only way to reduce spending permanently is to reduce taxes."
Even supply-side economists, who believe that tax cuts can pay for themselves through the resulting economic growth, are divided over the Bush plan. Jude Wanniski, president of the Polyconomics consulting firm, said the President should not make tax cuts dependent on spending cuts.
On Friday, Mr. Wanniski pounded out a letter to his clients accusing the President of giving in to "the budget-balancing proclivities of the Country Clubbers who remain firmly in control of the Republican Party."
But Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, said Mr. Bush had finally returned to the supply-side religion. Mr. Kudlow, now chief economist at Bear, Stearns, is one of the few Wall Street economists to applaud the Bush plan. Or perhaps, the Kudlow plan.
Mr. Kudlow said that the President's proposals reflected a memorandum that Jack Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, had recently given to the President -- a memo, Mr. Kudlow said, "which I helped draft."

HEADLINE: Computer Pioneer's Moment of Truth

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 23

 BODY:
As Japan's most famous personal computer entrepreneur, Kazuhiko Nishi, nicknamed Kay, has often seemed out of place in this land of conservative, conformist businessmen.
He is a college dropout, he started his own company rather than work for a large one and he has flaunted his wealth with a flamboyant style that has included dashing from meeting to meeting by helicopter. 
 But now the 36-year-old entrepreneur, often called the Steve Jobs of Japan in reference to the Apple Computer co-founder, is in the midst of a fight to save his company from bankruptcy. His problems are only too typical of those now afflicting Japanese businesses as the country's speculative boom has come to a halt.
 
Expansion Leaves Debts
 Driven by Mr. Nishi's grand visions and the easy availability of money during the boom in the last few years, Mr. Nishi's company, the Ascii Corporation, borrowed heavily as it expanded wildly beyond its basic businesses of software and computer magazine publishing. Now, the Japanese stock market has crumbled, money is tight and Ascii cannot pay its debts.
A coalition of six banks is expected to reach an agreement soon to provide Ascii with more than $100 million to allow the company to survive. But in return for the bailout, Mr. Nishi will have to sell off unprofitable parts of his empire. And while industry executives expect him to remain Ascii's president, he might have to give up some of his autonomy in running the company. A spokesman for Ascii said that Mr. Nishi could not be interviewed until an agreement was reached with the banks.
Mr. Nishi's plight is drawing widespread attention here because he has come to symbolize Japan's entrepreneurial sector, which the Japanese Government is trying to nurture. Small companies, which often develop the most creative products, are a big reason for the success of the American personal computer industry, a success Japan has yearned to emulate.
 
Software Companies Failing
 "If his company fails, it's going to discourage a number of future potential entrepreneurs," said George Hara, a venture capitalist and president of Data Control Ltd., a software company.
Already, small Japanese software companies are dropping by the wayside because Japanese corporations, hurt by the recession, are slowing their investments in office automation and because banks, needing to shore up their capital, are reluctant to give such companies new loans to tide them over the hard times.
In 1991, 87 software companies filed for bankruptcy protection, nearly double the 1990 total of 45, according to Tokyo Shoko Research, which monitors the financial health of companies. And through July of this year, 65 have filed for bankruptcy.
Part of Ascii's problems, Mr. Hara said, stems from the fact that start-ups in Japan have a difficult time luring experienced managers away from big companies. Such managers might have held in check some of Mr. Nishi's wilder dreams and helped Ascii control its costs.
Ascii (pronounced AS-key) was named after a code by which computers represent the alphabet. The company was started by Mr. Nishi and two friends in 1977, the year in which the first hugely successful personal computer, the Apple II, was introduced. Mr. Nishi, then a student at Waseda University, later dropped out to concentrate on the business.
His first big break came the next year when he called on another college-dropout-turned-entrepreneur, William H. Gates of Microsoft. Ascii became Microsoft's distributor in Japan and Mr. Nishi became a vice president of Microsoft in addition to his job at Ascii. The two men, who are the same age, became close friends and soulmates.
More a visionary and charismatic salesman than an engineer, Mr. Nishi helped create the personal computer business in Japan. He persuaded NEC to design Japan's first personal computer. And he put together the team that designed the first laptop computer, the Tandy Corporation's Model 100. In those days he was legendary for flying across the Pacific as often as two or three times a week, and for falling asleep on the floor out of exhaustion.
But Mr. Nishi was also prone to make big decisions on a whim and to spend freely, which led Microsoft to break with Ascii in 1986 and set up its own Japanese distribution. One of the final straws came when Mr. Nishi spent $1 million to have a huge mechanical dinosaur constructed in Tokyo as an advertising gimmick. The breakup between Mr. Gates and Mr. Nishi was bitter, although the two men now talk periodically.
Ascii overcame that setback, and its sales grew rapidly until leveling off last fiscal year at 34.5 billion yen, or about $270 million. The company issued shares to the public in 1989 and the stock soared, giving Mr. Nishi a fortune of more than $100 million.
He bought a customized Bentley and other fancy cars and an apartment on Central Park South in New York. He amassed huge collections of Chagall lithographs and of compact disks, at one time ordering a record store to send him one copy of each disk it sold.
The rising stock market also made it easy for Ascii, like other Japanese companies, to raise money by issuing bonds convertible into company stock. Buyers of such bonds accepted low interest rates on hopes of making their returns by converting into valuable shares.
Ascii ventured into computer chip design and sales and satellite data delivery. It invested in several American technology companies, including Informix, a software company, and Nexgen, a company trying to clone Intel's microprocessors. And as part of Mr. Nishi's efforts to move into multimedia -- the combination of computers and video -- Ascii bought the Japanese unit of Vestron Inc., a videocassette distributor, and a one-third stake in the Edward R. Pressman Film Corporation, the American independent movie maker that produced "Conan the Barbarian."
 
Investments During the Boom
 Ascii even went into the helicopter charter business and, like many other companies, invested in art and real estate, which seemed like good investments during a time of rising prices. Mr. Nishi was hatching plans to build an industrial park for software companies in northern Japan, equipped with modern electronics technology and its own airport. The plan has since been put on hold.
About a year ago, Ascii's two other co-founders, Akio Gunji, the chairman, and Keiichiro Tsukamoto, vice president, resigned abruptly, apparently in protest over the rapid expansion. "They could not keep up with me as I stepped on the gas too much," Mr. Nishi said at a news conference at the time.
But now, Japan's stock market has fallen and Ascii's stock has plunged from a peak of 21,000 yen to close at 515 yen on Friday, making Mr. Nishi's 11.9 percent stake worth less than $5 million.
Bonds worth about $85 million are due next March, and bond holders are not likely to want to convert them into such low-priced stock. Ascii will have to come up with cash to pay those bondholders. That is why it is hoping to borrow from the six banks.
Ascii has other needs for money as well. The company's total debt is 31.2 billion yen, or about $245 million -- or more than $350 million if its affiliates and subsidiaries are included. But the company still expects to report a pretax profit of 1.3 billion yen, or about $10 million, in the fiscal year that ends in March.
 
Need for a Larger Partner?
 Some experts think that if it is to continue to grow, Ascii might need to sell a stake in itself to a larger company, perhaps even an American one. Canon Inc. said last week that it had been asked to help support Ascii but that it had no money to spare. Ascii said it had only asked Canon to take part in a joint venture, not a bailout.
Some who know him say Mr. Nishi has now become a little less extravagant in his spending habits. But he is still coming up with visions and is not afraid to speak his mind. In a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in May, for instance, Mr. Nishi said what some other Japanese engineers might think but cannot say: that Japan's high-definition television system, the pride of the nation, is essentially obsolete because it uses older analog technology rather than the newer digital technology.
It is for comments like that that Mr. Nishi has been treated with a mixture of awe and disdain here. Some of his supporters say Japan's business establishment might not be unhappy that the upstart is getting his comeuppance.
"People like him are not easily accepted by the Japanese establishment," said Mr. Hara, the venture capitalist, who works in the United States as well as Japan. "His style is completely acceptable by the world's standard, but not here."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS: Rising Mark Reverberates in Britain and U.S.;
Sacrificing The Dollar to Spur Exports

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
President Bush did something unexpected in Houston last week. In the midst of all the speeches about pride in America, he appeared to have written off the dollar for now. If it falls, even from the all-time low it reached on Friday against the German mark, so be it, as long as the swoon is slow and orderly.
The decision is not necessarily bad -- or even avoidable. And it does not mean that the Administration would tolerate a sudden, steep plunge in the dollar. But it carries risks that could unnerve both the bond and the stock markets unless the dollar stabilizes more or less on its own. If the dollar plunges, investor confidence could erode further, pushing down stock and bond prices, and undermining the economy and Mr. Bush's campaign. 
 Until last week, John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers in New York, along with many other market analysts, thought that the Administration and its allies still wanted to halt the dollar's decline. There had been coordinated central bank intervention in support of the dollar in July and August, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said in interviews that the dollar was falling "ahead of itself."
 
'Exports Are the Key'
 But even though there was further intervention on Friday, Mr. Lipsky said, the "style and the scale of the intervention Friday left the markets with a clear impression that a decline in the dollar, as long as it was orderly, would be tolerated."
Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, also changed his mind. After listening to the President's Houston speech, he said: "Clearly exports are the key to his economic strategy. The dollar is not a primary concern of this Administration. Quite the opposite. If the economy requires a weaker dollar for exports, then they'll allow it."
Of course, in the secretive world of central banks and currency markets, there is always room for mistakes in interpreting policy moves. The central bank intervention on Friday might simply have been either unsuccessful or inept, and the market's reading might have been wrong.
But that does not change the uncertainty surrounding the Presidential election or the pressures placed on the United States and on the rest of Europe.
 
The Baker Touch
 Still, the policy choice, if it has been made, has the mark of James A. Baker 3d, the President's new chief of staff and guiding light for the re-election campaign. As the Treasury Secretary in the second Reagan Administration, Mr. Baker engineered the legendary Plaza Accord of 1985 that initiated a period of international economic cooperation and brought the dollar down from record levels to levels that helped stimulate American exports and reduce the troublesome trade imbalance.
In his acceptance speech last week, Mr. Bush emphasized the importance of exports in a growing economy. Of course, a lower dollar could make American companies even more competitive abroad.
More important, the policy may be just an acceptance of the inevitable because the international financial cooperation that Mr. Baker fostered, which was useful in stopping previous declines in the dollar, seems absent now.
The United States appears to be at economic odds now with Germany. The Bundesbank, the German central bank, has been pushing up interest rates to combat the inflation unleashed by the costs of the unification of the two Germanys. At the same time, the Federal Reserve has been pushing down rates to try to stimulate the weak American economy.
For the course of the dollar to reverse, investors must expect that Germany will lower interest rates or that the United States will raise them. At the least, investors and speculators must believe that there will be no more increases in Germany's rates and no more cuts in America's.
Short-term rates in Germany are close to 10 percent, three times the levels in the United States. And there is still the clear threat that the Bundesbank will push interest rates higher even as the Fed comes under continuing pressure to lower rates.
 
Reminiscent of 1987
 This situation reminds some traders and analysts of a similar dispute between the United States and Germany over interest rates and the level of the dollar that preceded the stock market crash of 1987. Mr. Baker, as Treasury Secretary, was in the middle of that conflict. But the disagreement today seems more muted, as the Bundesbank has participated in the recent efforts to support the dollar.
If the dollar's decline remains orderly, American financial markets might even rally, building upon the prospects for low inflation and slow economic growth. Several economists and traders said at the end of last week that the bond market could still rally to 7 percent yield from 7.35 percent on the 30-year bond, the lowest in two decades. Bond yields fall as prices rise.
"If the fundamentals give strong new signals then the market will react," Mr. Lipsky said.
The risk is that the dollar decline could get out of hand, as the failure of coordinated central bank intervention made clear on Friday. Despite dollar purchases by 16 central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, the American currency dropped more than 1 percent against the mark in just a few hours. And the fall took the stock and bond markets with it.
 
Influence on Fed
 Furthermore, if the Administration is believed to be willing to let the dollar decline continue, it may be hard to bar the door to big speculators who would relish testing how low the dollar can go. A sharper dollar fall could forestall an easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve that would otherwise occur and help the economic recovery. It might also lead to a decision to take more active measures, like raising interest rates, to shore up the dollar and maintain confidence in the financial markets.
Then, even if the Fed did not raise short-term rates, the recovery could be stalled if the meager housing boom is shut down. Such a crisis before the November election could be a disaster for the President, especially after he pointedly told America last week that he was the one to trust to keep the economy on an even keel.

HEADLINE: Argentina's Stock Regulator Faces Daunting Task

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Aug. 23

 BODY:
When Martin Redrado was named chairman of Argentina's National Securities Commission a year ago, he was just 29 years old, fresh from jobs in the United States with Salomon Brothers and the Security Pacific Bank, and the outlook for the Argentine stock markets he was to regulate seemed bright.
The economy was stable and growing at almost 5 percent a year, inflation was running below 20 percent, and the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange was booming, having just been discovered by a cadre of emerging-market investors from the United States and Europe. 
 Mr. Redrado set out to toughen enforcement to insure a fairer market, to lower the cost of trading on the exchange and to encourage more participation by institutional investors both inside Argentina and abroad.
 
Signs of Strain
 But now the landscape is bleaker, and Mr. Redrado shows signs of strain. Highly praised during the first months on the job, he is now criticized for being too much a booster of Argentine stocks and too little a hands-on regulator and enforcer.
"The general view of Martin is that he did a great job deregulating the market last year, but recently he has been promoting the market and the buying of stocks," said one leading securities analyst who insisted on anonymity.
There is reason for the griping. Since June, stock prices have plunged about 50 percent after a spectacular rise of almost 400 percent last year. The market decline paralleled similar falls in Mexico and Brazil in June, when Ross Perot was running strong in the Presidential race in the United States and came out against the free trade agreement with Mexico.
What investors found in Buenos Aires when they scrutinized the market more carefully was that stock prices were extremely high compared with their underlying earnings. That, coupled with the heavy borrowing to buy stocks, touched off the plunge.
Last week, the market fell 9.3 percent, adding to the gloom. Argentine investors, who thought they were riding an endless upward price spiral, have lost bundles. Foreign investors are now on the sidelines. And charges of insider trading and market manipulation are common.
 
Looking Long Term
 "We are going through a painful learning process," Mr. Redrado said in an interview recently. "We are trying to change a market that had been highly speculative and short-term oriented. Companies do not give out a lot of information. There is not a lot of research. Somehow, we have to get people to look at the long term."
That will not be easy. Decades of high inflation and sometimes hyperinflation have created a business culture here more concerned about fluctuations in currencies than in capital investments. And the stock market has been known for its lack of regulation.
Even though the economy has been stable now for 18 months, the slightest hint of a possible devaluation of the Argentine peso or an increase in social spending still sets the markets ajitter.
In the face of the uncertain investing climate, Mr. Redrado says he faces a quandary: the markets still need tighter regulation, he admits, but he feels he should also help create an image of Argentina as a good place to invest. That, he submits, naturally calls for a little cheerleading.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Redrado's regulatory model is the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The most prominent picture in his office is of himself with the S.E.C. chairman, Richard C. Breeden, and President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina. That picture suggests a desire, perhaps, to bring some of the credibility of United States markets to Argentina.
In fact, the linkages go beyond the photograph. Last fall, the National Securities Commission signed a memorandum of understanding with the S.E.C. that provides for the exchange of market and investigative information. Three Argentine enforcement officials have received training at the S.E.C. enforcement division in Washington. And the two organizations are seeking World Bank funds to bring S.E.C. officials to Argentina to train the whole 107-member enforcement team. The Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, earlier this month, signed an agreement with the American Stock Exchange providing for the exchange of information.
"I think this market is moving very much in the right direction," Mary Shapiro, an S.E.C. commissioner, said during a recent visit here. "What is still lacking are resources for the regulators, a greater education of the public and a higher level of professionalism."
 
Eliminating Restrictions
 In addition to edging closer to American regulators, Mr. Redrado has used his ties to the Economy Minister, Domingo Cavallo, and to President Menem to pass legislation bringing brokerage commissions down to a level roughly equal to those in the United States. A half-percent stamp tax, an eight-tenths of 1 percent transfer tax and all capital gains taxes on foreigners have been eliminated. And Mr. Redrado has cut the fees the exchange charges on large transactions by more than two-thirds.
The commission also pushed legislation to remove restrictions on foreign ownership of Argentine companies and give banks entry into the brokerage business. And Mr. Redrado hopes that by the end of the year, Congress will approve a new law that will permit pension funds to invest in stocks. He predicts that could bring in $300 million a month of investment into Argentine capital markets.
The more open climate has brought a flood of investment into the market. At the beginning of 1991, less than $5 million in stocks were traded daily; now the volume is about $60 million.
Perhaps Mr. Redrado's biggest task, however, is to make fraud and manipulation unprofitable, and this may involve some of the country's most influential business executives and lawyers. While specific details of wrongdoing are hard to come by, brokers and analysts say stocks are routinely manipulated, and that brokers trade ahead of large clients.
 
Few Penalties
 While the securities commission can sue a company for insider trading, fines are a maximum of $8,000 and criminal prosecution is nearly impossible.
The commission's strongest enforcement action to date was a move last month against, Colorin, a paint company that did not disclose an 800 percent increase in its net worth until after its stock had risen considerably. Admitting that it was nearly impossible to discover who benefited, the commission fined each board member $8,000.
Currently, Mr. Redrado is trying to get the Congress to approve new powers for the commission that would permit fines equal to twice the value of any illegal profits, in addition to forcing the return of all such profits.
The commission has yet to get a handle on the very high leverage that undergirds much of the market, as banks and brokers routinely lend clients most of the money to buy shares.
In March, when Telecom, one of the two privatized telephone companies, sold shares to the public, bankers set up booths in the streets of downtown Buenos Aires offering to lend investors 80 percent of the purchase price of Telecom shares. The large loans available for stock purchases exacerbated the market's plunge this summer, as investors had to sell to cover margin calls.
 
A Rich Resume
 Such gyrations and anxiety over the market's future keep Mr. Redrado constantly in the headlines, which he seems to enjoy. Although young, he already has a rich resume. After graduating from Harvard University with a master's degree in public administration in 1985, he spent six months in Bolivia with the Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, helping the Government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro bring a runaway inflation rate down to less than 20 percent a year. In the process, the Government laid off thousands of mine workers and balanced its budget.
Later that year, Mr. Redrado went to work for Salomon Brothers in its international capital markets group in New York and London. In early 1989, he moved to Security Pacific, where he was named managing director for the international division in early 1991.
He took on the job of heading Argentina's securities commission in mid-July 1991 at the urging of Mr. Cavallo, whom Mr. Redrado had met when they were both studying at Harvard. When he was first appointed, he said, his age used to be a problem. "In the press, they used to call me that young chairman of the securities commission," Mr. Redrado said. "Recently, they've taken off the young."

HEADLINE: LSI Logic Expects $100 Million Loss

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 23

 BODY:
Hurt in part by ferocious competition in the personal computer market, LSI Logic Inc., a leading maker of custom semiconductor chips, says it will take a restructuring charge of up to $110 million and lay off about 450 employees.
The layoffs will include 175 nonproduction workers in the United States and 275 production employees at a German plant that will be phased out of operation during the next six months. 
 Company executives pointed Friday to disappointing sales in Japan and in the military and aerospace markets. They said LSI planned to refocus its strategy on more profitable parts of its business. It will also look for new partners for both its design and manufacturing operations, they said.
Although the personal computer market accounts for only about 10 percent of LSI's sales, executives said the company had also been hurt by the problems at one of its big customers, the Digital Equipment Corporation, the giant maker of minicomputers.
LSI, which is based in Milpitas, Calif., said it expected the restructuring charge to result in a loss of more than $100 million in its third quarter, which ends in September. The company, a pioneer in the market for custom chips, had a profit of $804,000, or 2 cents a share, on sales of $172.4 million in the third quarter last year. It lost $5.9 million on sales of $151.8 million in the second quarter of this year.
 
'Long, Grinding Recession'
 "This has been a long, grinding recession, and at the same time we have a major slowdown in Japan," said Wilf Corrigan, chief executive of LSI.
He said that he expected the industry to pick up again in 1993 and that he was already seeing signs of a recovery.
The company said that by restructuring its operations and cutting costs it expected to save about $10 million in expenses each quarter, making a profit possible by the fourth quarter.
Mr. Corrigan said chip makers were coming under pressure because technology cycles in the business were actually becoming shorter as semiconductor designers pushed toward chips with circuit lines narrower than one micron.
"In the past, you could assume a new generation of tech could last three to four years," he said. "The increments of each generation of technology are shorter now."
As part of its shift in strategy, LSI will move its high-volume chip-manufacturing operations to Japan, where it is now developing a second factory in partnership with Kawasaki Steel. In the future, American operations will focus on low-volume manufacturing and pilot production, as well as development of new technologies.
In the personal computer market, for which LSI has sold the chips that surround the central microprocessors, the company has been hammered by waves of price reductions and cost-containment pressures from I.B.M. clone makers like Compaq Computer, Dell Computer and AST Research.
LSI executives said the company planned to refocus its efforts on markets in which it is able to differentiate its chip designs from those of its competitors, achieving higher profit margins as a result.
Mr. Corrigan said LSI was now in serious discussions with two semiconductor companies about a future manufacturing alliance and was involved in informal talks with half a dozen more. He cited recent international alliances among chip makers -- like one linking I.B.M., Toshiba and Siemens, another linking Texas Instruments and Hitachi, and a third linking Fujitsu and Advanced Micro Devices -- as an important trend as companies look to offset the huge costs of developing the next generation of chip-making factories.

HEADLINE: Even Falling Prices Can Be Painful

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
It's not just the $5 New York-Washington bus fare, the Gap stores' 26 percent cut in jeans prices and the aggressive air fare discounts, which could push some airlines into oblivion.
The prices of many items -- from gold and other commodities to television sets and new-model Chevrolets -- are falling. They are not just going up more slowly or going down only after allowing for inflation, but are actually falling, period. 
 Even the Government's far-ranging tally of consumer food prices showed a decline, albeit modest, during the first seven months of 1992. If sustained, this would be the first full-year fall since 1961.
 
Only a Whiff of Deflation
 Some economists are beginning to see what Edward Yardeni of the Wall Street firm C. J. Lawrence calls a whiff of deflation.
Yet nobody, including Mr. Yardeni, seems to think there is much chance that full-fledged deflation will occur. Deflation, according to the formal definition, is a decline in the overall level of prices, not just for certain items.
Nearly everyone agrees that deflation is a bad thing, even though it creates some individual winners -- like bondholders and other fixed-income lenders, so long as the borrowers do not default.
"We better hope we don't get to deflation," said Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist for ASB Capital Management, a Washington money manager. "It's a black economic hole that's hard to get out of," as ever-falling prices cripple production and profits and then jobs and incomes.
But the United States is far from repeating this unhappy experience, which occurred in the 1930's, economists say. For one thing, the chances of deflation in the 1990's are minimized by the existence of economic stabilizers, like unemployment insurance, which automatically injects increasing amounts of money into the spending stream as jobless rolls swell.
"No, I can't see anything" that suggests the threat of deflation, said Patrick C. Jackman, chief economist for the Labor Department unit that compiles the Consumer Price Index. Noting that American wages are still rising, though more slowly than in the past, he added, "It would take monumental drops in food and energy prices to have the C.P.I. go negative."
 
What We Have Now: Disinflation
 What this country and others do have is disinflation -- a slackening of price increases. Most policy makers regard this as a significant achievement, because it brings stability to the economy and financial markets. But it also has unwelcome side effects, especially in the near term as individuals and businesses adjust to it, and these effects have become painfully clear.
Perhaps the most obvious is the plight of retirees and others who rely on certificates of deposit and other shorter-term investments. With interest rates falling with inflation, their returns have withered to half or a third of previous levels.
The negative aspects of lower inflation also show up in the housing market, where mortgage rates are still falling and home prices in many parts of the country are severely eroded.
This combination produces various drags on the economy, some obvious and some less so.
Unlike inflationary times, when each price jump tends to encourage the financially able to buy before prices go up again, declining prices cause people to wait -- or even freeze them into inaction.
Ever-lower mortgage rates, for example, encourage the thought that financing terms may get still better, deferring purchases and discouraging the building of new homes. At the same time, properties on the market continue to languish and more owners cut prices. As equity erodes, these people not only feel poorer and buy less but may be unable to move, perhaps to a new or better job.
"That kind of thing can obviously slow the economy down," said Norman Robertson, economist for the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
On the positive side, those able to refinance their homes generally wind up with lower monthly payments, freeing the savings for other purposes. And of course, some buyers do act promptly as lower rates and lower prices make housing easier for them to afford.
Generally speaking, falling or nonexistent inflation makes debts more burdensome, sapping confidence and wherewithal as the borrower must repay in sound dollars instead of depreciated ones. This is what William Jennings Bryan protested a century ago using the image of a cross of gold to castigate unsympathetic Wall Street bankers.
Such consequences, at least temporarily restraining the economy, suggest to many that the ideal may be a modest, steady rise in prices.
"In mild inflation, the wheels of industry are initially well lubricated and output is near capacity," asserts Paul A. Samuelson in "Economics," his classic text. "Private investment is brisk, jobs are plentiful. Such has been the historic pattern." Losses to bondholders, it is thought, tend to be less than the gains to the rest of society.
While sometimes disputed, support for this view seems to be increasing. This may reflect the steadily growing service sector of the economy, where there seems to be almost inexorable upward pressure on wages, at the expense of the manufacturing sector. What happens, it seems, is that anti-inflation measures fall unduly on the latter.
 
Manufacturers Tend to Suffer
 "The more you squeeze inflation down, the more it comes out of the manufacturer's hide," observed Mr. Robertson, voicing the complaints of some of his bank's industrial customers even as the Federal Reserve was meeting last week to decide whether to cut interest rates further.
The Fed's choice seemed to be between buying more insurance against economic relapse or consolidating gains on the price front that have brought the inflation rate down to 2.3 percent over the latest three months.
But if modest inflation is the ideal, there is little agreement about just what level it should be.
"I don't think we have any idea of that," said William Branson, a Princeton University economics professor working temporarily at the International Monetary Fund. More important, he said, is preventing large unanticipated swings in aggregate prices.
"The big problems," Professor Branson said, "are in the transition from one level to another, or when there's a rise in the uncertainty" attached to any current rate.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Suburban Weeklies Hit By Rivals and Recession

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
The decline and possible demise of Pulitzer Publishing Company's chain of community weeklies in Chicago's northern suburbs could be a harbinger of the 90's for similar small newspaper groups that sprang up in the 80's around many cities.
For months, Pulitzer has been trying to sell the 15 papers after watching advertising decline 40 percent over three years and profits disappear entirely. Should no buyer emerge by Oct. 13, the company has said it will cease publishing the papers, ending 150 jobs. 
 "We got caught by a structural change," said Nicholas G. Penniman 4th, senior vice president of newspaper operations at Pulitzer, who added that he thought other groups of suburban weeklies could easily share the same fate.
 
Negative to Positive?
 Pulitzer acquired the papers from the Lerner family in 1985, a time when such publications were taking advertising dollars from metropolitan dailies all over the country. Indeed, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Pulitzer's flagship paper, was being battered by suburban weeklies, and the company thought it could turn that bitter experience into gain by doing the same thing to The Chicago Tribune and The Chicago Sun-Times.
When Pulitzer bought the Lerner group, it included 56 free publications under half a dozen titles to which a community's name was attached, such as The River Grove Times and The Niles Life. Most of their advertising revenue came from help-wanted classifieds, which were plentiful enough to create comfortable profits, though Pulitzer would not disclose numbers.
But Pulitzer failed with its fundamental strategy of winning real estate and automobile classifieds and retail ads from the major Chicago dailies.
 
Zoned Editions
 Like many metropolitan papers that watched competition in the suburbs mount in recent years, The Tribune invested heavily to create zoned editions that were essentially local papers tucked inside the big daily. The Sun-Times is more focused on the city but has aggressively defended its traditional strength in automotive classifieds.
When recession hit three years ago, help-wanted classified linage sank. And in hard times, the first cost cut that retailers make is advertising, beginning with second-tier publications like suburban weeklies.
To cut costs, Pulitzer converted to paid circulation, consolidated titles and dropped some towns. This cut circulation to between 100,000 and 150,000, from 300,000 in 1985, making advertising even harder to sell.
Mr. Penniman said Pulitzer had decided to sell because it considered the prospects grim, even if the economy improved. The employers who once swelled his papers with help-wanted classifieds probably will not rehire -- or advertise -- at anything like previous levels, he said.
And he said that suburban weeklies were being squeezed not only from above, by mass-market competitors like metro dailies, cable television and direct mail, but also from below, by even more narrowly focused community papers.
These papers, which through computer technology can spring up virtually overnight, are inexpensive to produce and increasingly are published in Korean, Hindi or other languages that reflect the ethnic cast of many suburban subcommunities.
Charles J. Carey, vice president of Henry Ansbacher Inc., the New York investment bank that Pulitzer hired to sell the Lerner group, said he thought a new owner might be able to restore profitability with an ultra-lean operation. He added that several serious buyers were interested.
But John Morton, a newspaper stock analyst for Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington, said that small weeklies within 50 miles or, in some cases, even 150 miles of a major city would probably have a hard time in the coming years.

The 'American Century': Beneficence or Illusion?

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

Grand Illusion
Critics and Champions
of the American Century
By John B. Judis
344 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $25.
 Is this departing century the American Century or is that idea only a "Grand Illusion," as John B. Judis calls it in the title of his thought-provoking book? In a Presidential election year, is the American Century just an old-fashioned jingoistic slogan, backed up by military threats and force, or do the words have some kinder, gentler meaning that takes into account the rest of the civilized world? 
 In a grandiloquent essay that appeared in a February 1941 issue of Life magazine, Henry Luce, founder of the Time Inc. publishing empire, tried to define what he branded the American Century. "It now becomes our time," he wrote, "to be the powerhouse from which the ideals spread throughout the world and do their mysterious work of lifting the life of mankind from the level of beasts to what the Psalmist called a little lower than the angels."
Fifty years later, after the American-led coalition victory in the Persian Gulf war, President Bush repeatedly invoked the notion of an American Century again. Speaking to Congress, he said the nation's best days were yet to come in the next American Century. At the Air Force Academy, he told the cadets that the United States had the strength to bear the burden of world leadership. On Veterans Day 1991, he said that the gulf war demonstrated that "America holds a special place in history" and that "we've sought to extend the blessings of liberty throughout the world."
In his well-organized and opinionated book Mr. Judis, a writer for In These Times and The New Republic and author of "William F. Buckley Jr.: Patron Saint of the Conservatives," presents a variety of views on the theme of the American Century. The author follows the Lytton Strachey ("Eminent Victorians") style of history: essays in iconoclasm built around a group of conflicting personalities.
Among them are Henry A. Wallace, Walter Lippmann, George F. Kennan, J. William Fulbright, Barry Goldwater, Lee A. Iacocca, Henry A. Kissinger and three Presidents, Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Some of these experts regard the idea of an American Century to be elusive or illusory, others see it as benevolent or belligerent. As an example of the author's range of characters, he labels Mr. Iacocca a "car salesman" playing the role of an "industrial statesman," while Ralph Nader, opposed to the Government's bailout of Chrysler, is described as "a left-wing trustbuster in the Jeffersonian tradition." The reader is seldom in doubt about which personality the author prefers.
The notion of America as the symbol of freedom and exemplary values goes back to Colonial times. In 1630 John Winthrop, the leader of the Massachusetts Bay Company, told his fellow passengers on the Arbella that they had not sailed across the Atlantic to find wealth but to build a "city on a hill." From John Winthrop to Henry Luce to George Bush, and many others, the tone of America as a superior nation has been evangelical: God's country.
Although the phrase "the American century" sounds simplistic and presumptuous, Mr. Judis finds that some American visionaries did indeed define a greater world role for the United States, though usually in less chauvinistic and more acceptable language.
Theodore Roosevelt and progressive intellectuals like Herbert Croly, the New Republic editor, and Walter Lippmann, the columnist, believed that the growth of industry could be shaped to serve egalitarian ends. President Franklin D. Roosevelt linked World War II to the effort to secure the Four Freedoms (freedom of speech and worship, freedom from want and fear) for people everywhere. Henry Wallace, Roosevelt's Vice President before Harry S. Truman, called for a global New Deal and the century of the common man. The postwar Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe began on President Truman's watch. During the Vietnam War, Lippmann, Kennan and Fulbright argued against expanding the evangelical role of the United States by military means. But Mr. Reagan's two terms in office increased the influence of the religious right and revived the cold war's evangelism.
In a chapter titled "George Bush and the Next American Century," Mr. Judis writes that with the threat of Communism gone, Mr. Bush was "utterly unable to articulate a new sense of America's purpose." In 1988, "emulating Reagan, he ran on the hollow promise of retaining the American Century." When the 1992 race started, "he began calling for a 'next American Century,' reducing Luce's call to arms to a campaign slogan."
"Grand Illusion" even challenges the way President Bush has handled foreign affairs. Mr. Judis maintains that while Mr. Bush was influenced by the Realpolitik of Mr. Nixon and Mr. Kissinger, "he had never tried to reconceptualize America's role in the world." On domestic matters, the author is even more critical: "As someone who had tried to span the different worlds of upper-class Connecticut and nouveau-riche Texas, Bush had unusual difficulty identifying with average Americans. As President, he seemed as distant from a laid-off Chrysler worker in St. Louis as from a Kurd on the Turkish-Iraqi border."
Comparing the first and last decades of the 20th century, Mr. Judis concludes that the difference between the Republican Roosevelt and the Republican Bush marks "the difference between the beginning and the end of the American Century." The author says that in an economically interdependent world, America's military power "is increasingly irrelevant" -- one of his opinions that surely can be challenged. Even if a Pax Americana isn't possible, such a view seems far-fetched in an armed world where tyrannical governments with nuclear ambitions still exist.
As a polemicist, Mr. Judis makes no effort to be evenhanded about the personalities in "Grand Illusion," which is why his book makes for such lively reading.

Meeting On Vincent Could Be Ordered

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Commissioner Fay Vincent will conduct a telephone meeting of major league club owners today, but it won't be the session sought by the owners who want to dismiss him.
Today's meeting will deal with the sale of the Detroit Tigers. It is a formality because owners in both leagues already have unanimously approved the transaction in unofficial league votes. The type of meeting the anti-Vincent faction of owners wants, in which they would ask Vincent to resign or be fired, would not be a formality. It could, on the other hand, turn out to be unofficial, and its results unenforceable. 
 Vincent has refused the request of the two league presidents to call a meeting that would deal with his status. But the two presidents, Bobby Brown and Bill White, at the urging of some of their employers, are expected to act under a provision of the Major League Agreement and summon the owners to a joint session in which Vincent would indeed be the main topic of discussion.
"I certainly wouldn't be surprised if there were a meeting," Bud Selig of the Milwaukee Brewers said yesterday.
Brown and White wrote to Vincent last Monday asking him to call a meeting so the owners could discuss "the terms and conditions of the commissioner." Vincent's opponents, who appear to be blaming him for many of baseball's economic problems, want him to resign under threat of dismissal. Vincent, whose term runs through March 31, 1994, says he will not resign and that he cannot be fired. And he has hired a lawyer, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., to represent him in case the owners do try to fire him.
 
Presidents Could Call a Meeting
 If the commissioner does not call a meeting within five days after receiving the request of the league presidents, according to Article V, Section 3 of the Major League Agreement, the presidents may call the meeting themselves. Five business days are up today, meaning Brown and White could make their move without further delay..
"I haven't talked to any owners today," Brown, the American League president, said yesterday when asked if he would call a meeting. "I will wait to see what they communicate tomorrow, and the next step will be taken depending on what they communicate."
Vincent's supporters say such a meeting would be unlawful because the Major League Agreement prohibits the owners from doing anything about a commissioner's powers during his term of office. Asked about the possible illegality of a meeting, Brown said, "I'd check with our league counsel to see if it was legal or illegal."
White, the National League president, declined to discuss the matter. "These things are internal matters," he said. "They will be handled internally."
Brown said that seven American League owners asked him to ask the commissioner to call a meeting. White would not say how many National League owners asked him.
If such a meeting is scheduled, it's not known who would attend, although it appears that Vincent wouldn't. The commissioner's supporters might choose to boycott the meeting as a way of showing their disdain for the effort of their colleagues to oust Vincent.
On the other hand, Vincent's supporters might feel they should attend so that they could counter the arguments made by those opposed to Vincent, arguments that could influence the owners who have remained neutral in this dispute.
 
Disagreement on Numbers
 In fact, there don't seem to be many neutrals. There also is disagreement about how many owners line up on each side. The anti-Vincent faction insists that a majority of the 28 club owners opposes the commissioner. No member of that group, though, has been willing to identify the members of that majority.
According to various owners and officials, an unofficial lineup would seem to look like this:
*Opposed to Vincent: Cubs, Dodgers, Cardinals, Giants, Pirates, Angels, White Sox, Indians, Brewers, Twins, Yankees, Blue Jays.
*Supporting Vincent: Mets, Astros, Expos, Braves, Padres, Marlins, Rockies, Orioles, Red Sox, Athletics, Mariners, Rangers.
*Undecided or unknown: Reds, Phillies, Royals, Tigers.
Blue Jays officials had indicated their support of Vincent, but they recently hinted that they might have signed a document that charges the commissioner with wrongdoing in half a dozen areas.
One owner said a lawyer for the Cubs wrote that document, which has not been presented to Vincent, and he described it as "vicious." The Cubs have been identified by more than one owner as the leader in the move to oust the commissioner. The Cubs are unhappy with Vincent's efforts to diminish the influence and income of television superstations, including the one owned by the Tribune Company, which owns the Cubs.
They have also sued Vincent over his ordered realignment of the National League, which would put the Cubs in the Western Division and give them later and less attractive times for some of their broadcasts.
With Vincent refusing to resign, his opponents could vote at the meeting to fire him. But without his consent to that action, which he described as illegal in a letter he wrote last Thursday, his opponents most likely would have to seek court action to enforce the dismissal and Vincent's eviction from his office at 350 Park Avenue.
Although different owners might have different reasons for wanting Vincent out, the major overriding reason is an economic one. Owners, especially those of small-market teams, fear for their future because of the escalation of player salaries and the threatened reduction of revenue from the next national television package.
Some of Vincent's supporters have suggested that the real aim of the dissidents is to break the players' union, but that they know they can't attempt it with Vincent in office.
When the owners locked out the players from spring training camps in 1990, Vincent helped negotiate an agreement with the union. His opponents believe he was too conciliatory in that instance and that he has continued to be too soft toward the union.
One Vincent supporter said that what the owners really would like to do to ease the economic problems is to enter into a new plan of collusion. The owners were found guilty of collusion from 1985 through 1987 and agreed to pay the players $280 million.
But Vincent, who wasn't commissioner at the time, is the only member of the major league baseball establishment who has acknowledged collusion took place. The owners don't like him for that, and, the Vincent supporter said, they know they can't try it again as long as he is around.
Another major conflict is over superstations. Vincent has been working hard in baseball and in Congress to reduce the effect of several superstations on locally televised games and to extract bigger payments from the superstations. The competition provided by superstations serves to undermine local television revenues.
The Cubs' parent company, the Tribune Company, resents Vincent's efforts because it owns a superstation, WGN-TV. It also holds television rights to six teams besides its own, and all but one of those teams is aligned with the Cubs against Vincent.

Quick Mischief's Upset Adds to Wacky Weekend

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., Aug. 23

 BODY:
Racing people were still trying to figure out how Thunder Rumble had shot to the head of the class of 3-year-old colts by winning two major races in three weeks at the Saratoga Race Course. And while they were doing it, the fillies and mares took the stage today and supplied an upset of their own: Quick Mischief outran the highly favored Versailles Treaty by nearly seven lengths in the $200,000 John A. Morris Handicap.
Versailles Treaty, a daughter of Danzig owned by Cynthia Phipps and trained by Shug McGaughey, doesn't get outrun very often and not by very much. In 16 races before today, she won eight times and ran in the money all 16 times. She ran in the money this time, too, but still was a soundly beaten 3-5 favorite in a Grade I stakes for fillies and mares on a race track renowned for beaten favorites.
 
Surrounded by Questions
 Meanwhile, the colts were still surrounded by questions about their own recent upsets. Ten of them ran a ringing Travers Stakes on Saturday, with $1 million on the line and 46,372 persons watching and betting $6.5 million, the most money ever wagered in one day at Saratoga in the 125-year history of the track. 
 But only one of the 10 colts had an excuse: Bien Bien, who shipped in from California after winning two recent stakes there, buckled coming out of the starting gate and tore a gash in his right front foot. Chris McCarron, who also had flown from California just to ride the colt, spent the entire mile and one-quarter trying to get back into the race while Dixie Brass set a sizzling pace before tiring with an eighth of a mile to go.
That was when Thunder Rumble did his number, as he did in the Jim Dandy Stakes three weeks earlier when he outran Dixie Brass by half a length at odds of 25-1. This time, at odds of 7-1, he ran down Dixie Brass in the final eighth of a mile and won the race by 4 1/2 lengths over Devil His Due. They were trailed by Dance Floor and Dixie Brass, while Furiously faded to sixth and the Canadian star Alydeed retreated to eighth.
 
A Fun Trip
 "That was fun," said Richie O'Connell, who trains Thunder Rumble for a Swiss economist, Konrad Widmer. "I was very sure he would win, but I didn't expect him to gallop. I would have to think, because he won with such authority, that he has to be considered at the top of his division."
Nobody disagreed with O'Connell's victory claim. In fact, the trainers of the speed demons agreed that their horses could run fast but not long, while Thunder Rumble and Devil His Due had showed that they could run very fast and very long.
"Dixie Brass came back good," his trainer, Dennis Brida, said this morning. "He ran as well as he could. The track was not really speed-favoring, especially going long, and I don't think he wants to go a mile and a quarter. We'll drop him back to a shorter distance. Like I've said before, I think we've got one of the best milers in the country."
 
Alydeed Comes Up Short
 Distance also may have been the undoing of Alydeed, who stalked the leader for one mile but then stopped stalking and dropped to the rear. His jockey, Craig Perret, suggested after the race that the colt may have suffered from pulmonary bleeding, which troubled him earlier this year.
"He hasn't run a race that dull since I've known him," said Perret.
But the horse was examined back at the barn, and no sign of bleeding was found. His trainer, Roger Attfield, said simply: "I don't know what the problem was. He took a blood test three days ago and the results showed him to be as healthy an equine as you could want to see."
"I've said he may be an exceptional miler," Attfield said. "But he didn't run an exceptional mile this time. I don't know what happened, and maybe I hope I never find out."
 
No Contest
 In the Morris Handicap, the main question was whether Versailles Treaty could catch Quick Mischief, who led all the way. The answer: No way. Quick Mischief, a 6-year-old mare owned by Greg G. Mordas of Millstone Township, N.J., and trained by Charles Carlesimo Jr. drew far in front in the homestretch and won by 6 3/4 lengths. Versailles Treaty was next, half a length in front of Scotty Schulhofer's Shared Interest.
The winner ran the mile and an eighth in 1:474/5 , returned $9.80 for $2 to win and went home with $120,000.
"Mostly, I train allowance and claiming horses," the trainer said, "so winning a race like this feels great."
 
FINISH LINE
 JULIE KRONE returned to the races after missing most of the last week with a siege of colitis, and rode Shared Interest. But two races earlier, she rode her first winner in a week aboard BILL MOTT's 2-year-old filly Jill Miner.

Grading Bush's Speech

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: PHOENIX

 BODY:
All eyes have been fixed on the effect of the Bush acceptance speech: conventioneers bought while investors sold and pollsters bounced.
But what of the speech itself? Did it measure up to the standard set in Mr. Bush's first acceptance speech four years ago -- and did it live up to the advance word that it would not only "redefine" his image but would tell the American people where he hoped to lead them in a second term? 
 Those of us who were rooting for him to deliver a thematic, inspirational address that set forth realistic economic and foreign policies were disappointed. Here is a report card from a former Republican speech-writer who still wishes he could be more of a Bush supporter:
1. Structure: It was as if the first and last 10 minutes of the speech were written by an articulate idealist (Ray Price, my estimable Nixon colleague) but an interminable 40-minute middle -- a laundry list, complete with the hoary line-item veto, left over from the State of the Union Message -- was jammed in by a scathing partisan (Robert Zoellick, James Baker's writer). Result: a pushmi-pullyu polemic, going in opposite directions.
2. Tone: Throughout his speech's sagging center, Mr. Bush adopted the uncharacteristic pose of ridicule. His shaft at Mario Cuomo's indecisiveness was lost on listeners unfamiliar with Baskin-Robbins; his "Slippery When Wet" charge was insensitive to auto accidents in the Clinton and Gore pasts; two references to Elvis Presley were one too many, and a derogation of the "tasseled loafers" of lawyers seemed out of place for a patrician more familiar with Gucci than most Democrats. Mr. Bush, good at sincerity, is poor at ridicule.
3. Delivery: In rejecting Democratic ridicule, as in his repeated "tell that to" passage, he used Churchillian anaphora to drive home his point with confidence and zest; Roger Ailes, his coach, has reason to be proud. However, in the speech's roughest personal shot -- "while I bit the bullet, he bit his nails" -- Mr. Bush, perhaps because it was out of character, blew the line.
4. Phrasemaking: "The gridlock Democrat Congress" is a nice evocation of Harry Truman's "do-nothing 80th Congress," and picks up on Ross Perot's favorite word. "A rubber-check Congress and a rubber-stamp President" was good, but the use of alliteration -- calling Congress a web of "PAC's, perks, privileges, partisanship and paralysis" that "puts politics ahead of principle, and above progress" -- was Harding-like in its excess. ("Not nostrums but normalcy, not experiment but equipoise . . .") Good focus on the target was shown in "Our policies haven't failed; they haven't been tried," but "our new crusade," coined to counter the religiosity of Clinton's "New Covenant" and to evoke Eisenhower, is unlikely to catch on.
5. The Fresh Idea: The tax-return checkoff is a gimmick to try to deal with the worst shortcoming of the Bush Presidency: unrestrained spending that caused a ballooning deficit. His serious plan is to throttle down increases in Medicare, Medicaid and veterans' benefits to the rate of inflation and new beneficiaries -- a necessary discipline -- but in this he bit his nails rather than the bullet. By sugarcoating his entitlement restraint with a vague promise of tax-rate reduction, Mr. Bush destroyed the credibility of deficit reduction.
6. Omissions: The speech was improved by leaving out cracks about Hillary Clinton or overtly dwelling on family values; it was diminished by a fear of mentioning or comforting the unemployed.
7. Peroration: His railroad-whistle- in-the-night passage -- standing a pre-dawn watch "when God introduces you to yourself" and presaging a national sunrise -- worked.
8. The Implanted Film Clip: As "an aside," he promised to "never let politics interfere with a foreign policy decision" no matter how much it would help his re-election.
This is a rhetorical time bomb set to go off at a moment of crisis. Intended for replay when he zaps Saddam or puts medics in Sarajevo, those words may turn out to be the most memorable line of a speech in which the President "redefined" himself as Harry Truman because he could not define himself as George Bush.

The Price Of Lies

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
If you wonder why Americans have become so cynical about politics, take a close look at George Bush's acceptance speech at the Houston convention. It was a classic of the misrepresentations, the hollow promises, the brazen falsehoods that have made people turn off.
The big news in the speech was the promise of an across-the-board tax cut. Everyone likes the idea of paying less in taxes. But the Bush plan was so hollow that it collapsed at once when analyzed -- not only by the Democrats but by conservative economists. 
 Herbert Stein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Nixon, told The Boston Globe: "We're not likely to see any tax cuts out of this. It's just to fill up the space until the election."
The Bush plan calls for tax cuts to be matched by cuts in Federal spending. But Mr. Stein pointed out that the President also demanded a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and any spending cuts would have to go to reducing the deficit. "You can't sell the same spending cuts twice," he said.
Moreover, some of the particular cuts proposed by Mr. Bush -- in medical care for the elderly and the poor -- have no chance of enactment, and he knows it. In fact, his budget this year called for increases in Medicaid spending.
But my favorite passage in the Bush speech was this one: "From Angola to Central America they [the Democrats] said, 'Let's negotiate, deliberate, procrastinate.' We said, 'Just stand up for freedom.' "
The purpose of that passage was of course to make the Democrats look unpatriotic. Mr. Bush was using the tactic pioneered by Richard Nixon and Joe McCarthy. But in the examples he chose he turned the record exactly backward.
In Angola, the consistent American policy through the Carter, Reagan and Bush Administrations was to help negotiate an end to the brutal civil war. The policy was brought to a successful conclusion -- an admirable conclusion -- by Hank Cohen, Mr. Bush's Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. Mr. Cohen must be surprised to hear that his President thinks he was unpatriotic.
In Central America, the Reagan policy, created by Al Haig, was to stoke up war. Mr. Bush's Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Bernard Aronson, turned that policy around. He aimed for a negotiated end to the war in El Salvador and a political solution in Nicaragua.
The peaceful policy worked -- with crucial help from Jimmy Carter at the Nicaraguan election. Mr. Aronson, too, must be surprised to know that President Bush disapproves of negotiation.
Then there was Mr. Bush's statement that Bill Clinton had "raised taxes and fees 128 times" as Governor of Arkansas. Dan Quayle first used that figure. It has the delusory precision of Joe McCarthy's claim that he had the names of 155 or 163 Communists in the Government.
But the figure had been examined by Michael Kinsley in The New Republic, and exploded, before the convention. Mr. Kinsley showed that the list produced by the Bush-Quayle campaign was, as he put it, "hilariously shoddy."
One item listed as a "tax increase" was a 1987 law lengthening the Arkansas dog-racing season. Why? More days, more revenue from the state gambling tax. Another was a $1 increase in court costs imposed on convicted criminals. And so on.
There have been about as many tax cuts as increases in Mr. Clinton's years as Governor. And Arkansas is 49th among the 50 states in per capita state and local taxes.
The word carpenters who put together the Bush speech surely knew the 128 figure was phony. They put it in there anyway, and Mr. Bush used it.
Does that matter? Maybe I am naive, but I think it does. Hyperbole is to be expected of politicians. But deliberate lies? I think that kind of politics has brought this country close to disbelief in its own political system.
When an incumbent President makes such a speech, the purpose is to distract the voters from his record. But as Mr. Bush spoke, the real world reminded us of the record. The dollar fell to a record low against the German mark. The stock market dropped sharply. And the largest number of Americans in a decade filed new unemployment compensation claims

HEADLINE: Rising Mark Reverberates in Britain and U.S.;
Weak Pound May Require Hard Choice

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 23

 BODY:
The recent strengthening of the German mark is forcing Britain to confront its most painful lesson yet about the costs of economic integration with the Continent.
Although deeply ambivalent about unification with Europe, Britain agreed two years ago to link its currency to the value of other European currencies, promising to keep the pound within an agreed-upon range relative to the mark. 
 And with the pound, like the dollar, plunging in value against the mark last week, Britain now stands at the brink of being forced to prop up the value of its currency. Any further fall in the value of the pound, in fact, could force Prime Minister John Major into a step he is clearly loath to take: raising interest rates to support the pound, despite the additional economic suffering such a move would inflict on the recession-bound British economy.
 
A Challenge for This Week
 Mr. Major and Norman Lamont, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, are expected to try to deal with any further decline in the pound this week by first trying to intervene heavily in foreign currency markets to check the strength of the mark, perhaps in coordination with the Federal Reserve in the United States and other central banks that are concerned with the weakened dollar. The pound traded below 2.8 marks on Friday, and finished the day just two pfennigs above the lower limit allowed under the exchange-rate mechanism of 2.778 marks.
But analysts said that previous efforts to bolster the pound, and the dollar, had been unavailing, and that if Mr. Major and Mr. Lamont plan to stand by their pledge to maintain the pound's value and stay in the exchange-rate mechanism, they may soon find themselves with no choice but to raise interest rates by a full point or two from their current level of 10 percent.
"The rules appear to require us to put up interest rates," Peter Morgan, the director general of the Institute of Directors, a business trade group, said in a radio interview with the BBC on Saturday. "It is the economics of the madhouse, but we have agreed to play by the rules."
 
Building Up the Pound
 Government officials said participation in the exchange-rate mechanism had built confidence in the stability of the pound and had helped impose a financial discipline on Britain that contributed to a decline in inflation rates and to what until now had been a general downward trend in interest rates.
"Since we have joined the E.R.M., we have been able to bring down inflation and interest rates on a regular basis, but nobody ever thought this would be a one-way street," Gerry Malone, the deputy Conservative Party chairman, said in a radio interview with the BBC. "What would totally undermine confidence in the Government's policy would be if there is a problem like this and we were prepared to rule out the possibility of the use of interest rates as a mechanism to maintain our position in the E.R.M."
Yet in a country that remains divided about how far it should go in integrating itself into a unified Europe, the possibility of having to sacrifice short-term domestic economic priorities to the possible longer-term benefits of stable currency valuations has in a matter of days become a potent political issue.
 
Deep Political Splits
 It has not only widened the split between Mr. Major's Conservative Party and the opposition Labor Party, but also enlarged the deep fissures within the Conservative ranks over Britain's proper role in the new Europe. And it could put Mr. Major, who is currently serving his rotating term as President of the European Community, in an awkward position as he tries to use that post to advance Britain's interest in the balky process of unification.
"An increase in interest rates would be a terminal blow to factories already low in orders and homeowners already in arrears," said Robin Cook, a member of Parliament who serves as the Labor Party's spokesman on trade and industry issues. "As president of the E.C., John Major should be taking the lead in getting a coordinated cut in interest rates across Europe."
The possibility of interest rate increases has already started debate anew over whether Britain should remain within the exchange-rate mechanism at all. And it seems likely to refocus attention on the larger question of how much control the nation should be prepared to give up over its own economic destiny to make itself part of a unified Europe.
 
Cost of High Interest Rates
 Any move to raise interest rates would hit consumers and homeowners hard by pushing up mortgage rates and other key rates, and could choke off what few signs of recovery the British economy has shown in recent months.
Even a sharp increase in interest rates, though, might not hold the pound's value for long, some analysts said. Opinion polls in France show growing sentiment against approving the Maastricht Treaty on European unification when it is put to a referendum in that country next month. A French vote against the treaty, analysts said, would virtually insure the end of the current efforts at unification. That in turn would raise further questions about the long-term prospects of the British economy and could drive the pound lower once again.

HEADLINE: HURRICANE ANDREW;
Hurricane Rips Through Florida and Heads Into Gulf

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
One of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes of the century slammed into South Florida yesterday, causing at least nine deaths, leveling thousands of houses south of Miami and all but destroying an Air Force base.
As the hurricane swirled westward into the Gulf of Mexico, residents of coastal Louisiana and Mississippi began preparing for the storm's relentless winds by stocking up on food and taping windows. The National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., issued a hurricane warning for the area from Pascagoula, Miss., to Vermilion Bay, La., and said it could strike the Gulf Coast as early as tonight. 
 Blustering along with winds that at times reached 150 miles an hour, Hurricane Andrew peeled roofs from houses and other buildings in South Florida and flipped over huge commercial fishing boats like children's bathtub toys. It left tracks from Miami's elevated mass-transit system rail system dangling from trestles.
 
Disaster Area Declared
 President Bush declared much of South Florida a disaster area, opening the way for Federal disaster assistance in the form of emergency money for rent payments, loans for businesses to rebuild and unemployment assistance for hurricane-related job losses. After flying to Miami to inspect te damage, Mr. Bush said, "I want to let the people know at this moment, this terrible moment, that all of us are concerned. And I'll say to the people of Florida, the rest of America is here to back you in any way we can."
Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, who also toured the area, described the damage as "devastating."
"I never saw anything like that," Governor Chiles said. "It's like an air bomb went off."
By 2 A.M. today, the hurricane, its winds about 140 m.p.h., was 305 miles southeast of New Orleans, moving west-northwest.
 
Guard Controls Looting
 While downtown Miami and Miami Beach suffered relatively little structural damage, the storm's fury was concentrated just 10 to 15 miles farther south, in areas like Cutler Ridge, Homestead and Kendall, where some Miami Beach residents huddled in a shelter that lost its roof in the storm. Their Miami Beach apartment building was unscathed.
But even in Miami, entire neighborhoods had no electricity, no telephone service and no running water. Much of the city's glittering skyline fell dark at nightfall after a day that began with blasts of tropical air stripping the paint off houses and the sky turning green and yellow and purple.
Thousands of National Guard troops were sent in to join local law-enforcement officers trying to prevent looting, which had been reported sporadically throughout the day. Miami and Dade County, the jurisdiction that surrounds the city, imposed 7 P.M.-to-7 A.M. curfews.
The Air Force had evacuated all but 18 of its 4,300 military personnel from its base at Homestead over the weekend, and most of its F-16 fighter jets and C-130 transports had been sent to bases in South Carolina and Georgia. Still, the preparations were not enough. "Homestead Air Force Base no longer exists," said Toni Riordan, a spokeswoman for the State Community Affairs Department.
Officials said Florida would have suffered more casualties if people had not followed the evacuation orders issued Sunday night. More than a million people left their homes for safer quarters -- shelters, hotels or friends' houses inland. "Thank goodness we had the kind of evacuation we did," Governor Chiles said. "There was no way in the world anybody could have survived."
Suddenly, the landscape was fantastical: tall palm trees yanked out of the ground with balls of roots and turf still attached, leaving lawns looking like pockmarked green carpets. In places, it was as if a giant, mad wood-chopper had hacked its way through cypresses, pines and palms. In other places, roofs had been sheared away like sardine-can lids and sailboats grabbed from the water and dropped randomly on what had been dry land. Small airplanes were strewn along runways at the Tamiami Airport; the hangars that had sheltered them had been blown away.
"It's like building blocks, and somebody comes along and steps on it all," Dade County Manager Joaquin Avino said.
 
Help From the Unscathed
 Taking in the strange-looking scene in the aftermath of the storm, Floridians created strange-looking scenes of their own. In Kendall, a man tottered on a bicycle, steering with one hand while he aimed a video camera with his other. In Florida City, where Col. Bill McDonald of the Monroe County Sheriff's Office said there had been two hurricane-related deaths, officers borrowed a van from a Baptist church to patrol the streets. Only 1 of 11 police cars had survived the storm.
But for all its fury on the mainland, the hurricane barely touched Key West. By last night people from Key Largo were bringing supplies north to Florida City. Greg Brown, a grocery-store butcher in Key Largo, was headed to the mainland with a pickup packed with frozen pizzas, bagels and other perishables.
And even on the mainland, the devastation was leavened by relief that the storm had followed the path it did. In Miami Beach, Mayor Seymour Gelber said the storm had been "considerably less devastating than everyone had anticipated."
 
No Way Back for Some
 Evacuees were allowed to return to their homes beginning at 5 P.M. yesterday, and most did so. On some streets there were impromptu block parties, but some elderly people who live in hotels spent a second night in emergency shelters because there were no buses to take them back. Reporters who tried to cross from the mainland to Miami Beach were turned back by police officers, who admitted only those with identification to prove that they lived there.
Information from the areas hardest hit was difficult to come by for much of the day. At 11 P.M., The Associated Press was reporting nine hurricane-related deaths in Florida, but the Florida emergency agency said it could confirm only two. With much of the state unreachable by phone, stories of the destruction trickled in gradually, in some cases through a ham radio station at the United Nations that is part of a loose network of about 70 stations.
David Rosen, the station manager, said that an operator in Homestead had reported that blocks and blocks of homes were in splinters and that people were having trouble identifying the intersections in Hartford Square, a few miles from Homestead.
 
Looting and Inconvenience
 Like people up and down the coast, residents there had shuttered their homes, packed their suitcases and checked into hotels or found government-run shelters. Mary Barmmer,who lives in an unincorporated section of Dade County south of Miami, spent Sunday night in her husband's office building near Miami International Airport before heading for a hotel in Kendall.
Her 14-year-old son, Brendan, was worried about his 9-year-old cat, E.T., whom they left at home. "I don't know if he can take all the stress," he said.
The Marriott they checked into had windows that had blown in and toilets that had exploded as the storm approached and the air pressure dropped.
In Miami Beach, residents told of seeing looters casually strolling the streets, carrying merchandise like running shoes. But Mayor Gelber said there had been only three reported instances of looting, affecting primarily businesses on Lincoln Road, the city's pedestrian shopping mall.
Of more concern than looting, Mr. Gelber said, was the absence of basic public services. "We don't have water, and we don't have electricity except for one small 10-block strip," the 72-year-old mayor said. "People are grumbling, as one would expect. They have already forgotten the fright of what the hurricane had in store for us. They all want to be back home, working on their problems and enjoying the ordinary amenities of life to which people are accustomed. I walked up 14 floors to my condo today, for instance."
In the hardest-hit areas of southern Dade County, progress in reopening highways and restoring telephone service was too slow for many returning residents. Spokesmen for both the Department of Public Works and the telephone company said that repair crews had to wait for word from Florida Power and Light that wires that had been knocked down by falling trees were no longer live.
Ms. Riordan, the spokeswoman for the Department of Community Services, said that state officials were having trouble moving some emergency equipment and National Guard units to Dade and Monroe Counties because residents returning home from temporary shelters were jamming the Florida Turnpike.
"It's bumper to bumper," she said.
 
Airport Damaged
 Miami International Airport remained closed to commercial flights, and officials said that it would not reopen until repairs had been made to damaged areas. Security fences around runways and some passenger jetways were damaged, and the Federal Aviation Administration will not allow normal service to resume until repairs are made. Authorities said that the airport's one functioning runway was being reserved exclusively for relief flights.
Many local institutions were ordered to remain closed today. Local courts will be closed, and postal employees were told to stay home. The University of Miami said it would be closed at least through Wednesday.
All the damage came from a hurricane that seemed to blossom suddenly, on Saturday, into one of the most powerful ever to strike the East Coast. Meteorologists attributed this to a variety of factors.
As it chugged across the Atlantic, the storm's energy was sapped by a competing low-pressure system to the north. This second storm not only competed for energy; its high-level winds also clashed with those of the hurricane.
When the northerly storm moved away, Hurricane Andrew began to gain strength. At the same time it moved over warmer water, which imparted more energy to it. And as it approached the Florida coast, it met a huge high-pressure system, covering the eastern United States, whose "friendly" wind patterns allowed the hurricane to build. The big high-pressure system also blocked the hurricane from moving farther north, directing it instead toward southern Florida. And the strong east-to-west winds along the high's southern edge pushed the hurricane along a bit faster than might otherwise have been the case, causing it to clear Florida in a relatively brief three hours.
"This was like a trot as opposed to the standard walk," said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University's Weather Communications Group.
Forecasters predicted yesterday that the edge of the high pressure system would continue to guide the storm northwestward through the Gulf of Mexico toward the mouth of the Mississippi. They forecast the storm's peak winds at between 110 and 130 m.p.h. when it makes landfall on the Gulf Coast, probably between 8 P.M. today and 2 A.M. Wednesday. That would make it a Category 3 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity, with Category 5 the strongest.
The hurricane's winds are expected to diminish rapidly after it makes landfall along the Gulf. But forecasters expect its rains to cause widespread flooding as the storm breaks up and its remnants move up the Missisippi Valley before turning northeastward.
The course that the storm appeared to be following was close to that of Hurricane Betsy in 1965, a Category 3 storm that struck both southern Florida and New Orleans, causing nearly $1.5 billion worth of damage and killing 75 people.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Rochester Serves as Model In Controlling Health Cost

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCHESTER

 BODY:
In the search for ways to slow the surge in national medical spending, policy makers and economists are paying growing attention to this prosperous industrial city of 232,000 in upstate New York.
Health-care experts say Rochester is one of the few American cities that have systems that work. Although medical costs have also been rising rapidly here in recent years, they are still at least 25 percent lower per capita than national levels. And in Rochester, only 6 percent of the population does not have insurance, according to a survey by Louis Harris & Associates, far below the 14 percent national rate. 
 By cooperating closely, instead of competing ferociously as they do in most cities, the doctors, the hospitals and the local businesses have kept the quality of care high, with a relatively low level of waste and unnecessary care. The General Accounting Office is preparing a report on the Rochester system for Congress.
 
Program Called 'a Jewel'
 "Rochester is a jewel in a sea of health-care despair," said Stephen Skorcz, a Toronto hospital executive who was president for four years of the Rochester Area Hospitals Corporation, a nonprofit planning and research group that the hospitals established.
The Rochester program has served the interests of the city's largest employers, including Eastman Kodak and Xerox, by holding down the growth in costly health-care benefits. But the chief beneficiaries have been the families and small businesses that would typically not have access to affordable care because they were not part of a larger group.
 
Equality of Payments
 Under the Rochester plan, they pay the same monthly premiums for each person as Kodak and Xerox, for equal benefits. And unlike most health-care plans for small groups, no one pays more or is refused coverage because of age, sex or a previous medical condition.
Doctors and business and hospital executives around the country say one reason the Rochester system works is that local industry, vigorously led by Kodak, which has 39,000 employees here, cooperates closely.
All but a few employers buy their insurance from Rochester Area Blue Cross and an independent health maintenance organization, instead of following the national pattern of insuring themselves in separate arrangements. This self-insuring can reduce a large company's costs, at least for a time, but it often increases the burden for small companies, which have few employees over which to spread the risks.
David E. Edwards, Kodak's benefits director, compared the company's community-first philosophy to the maxim "the family that prays together stays together." Kodak's 1991 health costs averaged $2,100 an employee in Rochester, which was 25 percent lower than at the company's operations in other cities. Kodak's total cost last year for all employees, retirees and dependents was $240 million.
Rochester Area Blue Cross and Blue Shield said the cost of health-care coverage per employee in company plans here was $2,378 in 1991, about one-third less than the $3,573 reported in a national survey of employers by the A. Foster Higgins benefits consulting firm. Those numbers include both employer and employee contributions.
In addition, Blue Cross administrative costs were 7 percent of revenues, much lower than national estimates of 14 to 24 percent for most insurers. Rochester Blue Cross officials said the reasons for their lower costs included the efficiency of their electronic claims processing, the high productivity of their employees and therelatively low spending on advertising.
More than half of the region's one million people are in health maintenance organizations, which are prepaid health plans that offer comprehensive coverage, including regular checkups, and try to help their members avert expensive hospital stays. Even the handful of self-insured employers, including Bausch & Lomb and General Motors' Delco Chassis and AC Rochester units, say most of their Rochester people are in one of the two local H.M.O.'s, one of which is offered by Blue Cross. Blue Cross H.M.O. premiums last year were as much as 25 percent lower than for comparable for traditional coverage.
 
Reins on Hospitals
 Another area of industry cooperation has included close oversight of the area's seven hospitals, which represent a large portion of the costs of health care. Backed by state health planning laws that require approval for big projects or purchases, the Rochester business executives who sit on the hospital boards have kept a tight lid on new buildings and technology. "No one proposes a Taj Mahal," said Albert D. Sharbonneau, executive vice president of the Genesee Hospital in Rochester, which has 424 beds. "It's not worth your time."
No additional hospital beds have been authorized since the 1960's, so more than 90 percent of the beds are always occupied. With all the patients they can handle, "the hospitals haven't had to get into helicopter wars," said Arthur Liebert, president of the 526-bed Rochester General Hospital, referring to the helicopters some hospitals deploy in emergencies.
Avoiding expensive duplication, the hospitals have agreed over the years on which institutions should perform certain specialized services -- like organ transplants, open-heart surgery, pediatrics, psychiatry -- usually with related teaching programs at the University of Rochester medical school.
Under industry pressure, the hospitals agreed to let the Hospital Corporation set communitywide budget ceilings for a time in the early 1980's. This forced them to squeeze down spending. Then because costs were lower than the going rates paid by Medicare, Rochester voluntarily gave back to surprised Federal officials a total of $4.8 million in 1984 and 1989 to prove the effectiveness of its approach.
"When we took the check down to Washington, they didn't know what to do with it," said Dr. James A. Block, who headed the Hospital Corporation at the time and is now president of Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. "Nobody had ever returned Medicare money before."
But when the hospitals began to experience operating losses in the late 1980's, they rebelled against the budget ceilings. Other developments, including expensive new diagnostic equipment and surgical procedures, soon were pushing medical costs in Rochester up as rapidly as in other cities, albeit from a much lower base.
 
Costs Begin to Climb
 "Costs have been creeping up in the past few years," said Patricia M. Nazemetz, Xerox's benefits director. But she said that local business executives were trying to get planning back on the table, with all the interested parties taking part in the discussion.
To keep the hospitals cooperating, Donald D. Zrebiec, a retired Xerox executive, is helping to direct a program in which management experts from Kodak, Xerox, General Motors and I.B.M. are advising eight Rochester area hospitals on how to improve the quality of their service.
With hospitals closely controlled in New York State, most health-care spending has moved to physicians' offices and clinics, which often buy their own computerized scanners and magnetic-imaging machines. The Rochester Area Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association is considering an innovative plan that would put pressure on these buyers to get approval as the hospitals do.
Another cornerstone of the Rochester plan is the single-price approach, known as community rating.
Under community rating, everybody -- young and old, healthy and infirm -- is grouped together so the risks and costs are spread evenly across large numbers of people. By contrast, when they become sick or grow old, most individuals and members of small groups have to pay higher premiums or drop their coverage, joining more than 30 million Americans who are uninsured.
Al Ross, a 59-year-old home maintenance contractor, kept his Blue Cross coverage in Rochester after he moved with his wife and two children to Hilton Head Island, S.C.. "Here they charge according to your age," he said of South Carolina, "and there is an additional charge for each child. I'd feel crushed if I had to pay that."
 
Trends in Health Insurance
 Only a few other places, notably Hawaii, have kept community rating, which was common before insurers began to compete for the business of small groups with varying rates. This and other kinds of competition in health care came into vogue in the 1980's in hopes that the pressures of the marketplace would slow rising medical costs, but the practice has tended to favor groups of healthier people and exclude people who are at risk of incurring higher medical bills.
Modified versions of the single-price approach have recently been adopted statewide by Maine, Vermont, Oregon and New York, where the law will take effect on April 1. Community rating is also under study in several other state legislatures and in Congress.
Commercial insurers who oppose community rating say the system would force them to raise premiums beyond the reach of many young and healthy policyholders. That has not happened, however, in Rochester. But Chris Petersen, a senior counsel with the Health Insurance Association of America, a commercial insurers' group, contends that the Rochester system can function only because Blue Cross plans in New York are exempt from state taxes and get discounts on hospital charges.
 
Power of Example
 Policy makers in Washington and across the country express interest in adopting at least parts of the Rochester system. But experts disagree over how many of the Rochester advantages could be replicated elsewhere.
People in Rochester "have been out in front in showing how they can behave as a community," said Dr. Merlin DuVal, a former Assistant Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare who is dean emeritus of the University of Arizona College of Medicine.
Dr. Block of Johns Hopkins said the Rochester approach could be transferred to any city if local business leaders would join in supporting a unified regional insurance program. Kodak executives said they were discussing similar approaches in several cities where the company has large plants.
But Humphrey Taylor, chief executive of Louis Harris and Associates, was doubtful. "They have a sense of community in Rochester, which just doesn't exist in most places," he said.
Even if the Rochester program cannot be translated exactly, it may well offer some useful lessons to communities elsewhere. "The Government can learn from Rochester's example," said Howard Berman, president of Rochester Area Blue Cross and Shield. "We have an American success story."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Tells of Plan For More Spending To Train Workers

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANSONIA, Conn., Aug. 24

 BODY:
Declaring that the nation "cannot afford to waste the talent of one single worker," President Bush said today that he would ask Congress next year to approve a major expansion of Federal job training programs that would provide about $10 billion in additional money over five years.
The proposal would provide vouchers that could be used to pay tuition at trade schools, colleges and community colleges for unemployed adults and some others in danger of losing their jobs. The plan is clearly a response to accusations in the political campaign that Mr. Bush has been insensitive to the American work force. 
 The President made the proposal at the Lincoln Technical Institute in the blue-collar town of Union, N.J., and moved on for a campaign stop in Ansonia, Conn., which has been hit hard by the economy, before changing his schedule to fly to Florida to tour areas devastated by Hurricane Andrew.
Contrasting his plan with that of his challenger, Gov. Bill Clinton, Mr. Bush said it would not rely on new taxes and would be financed largely by cutting other domestic programs. But the President, who has repeatedly assailed Mr. Clinton for proposals that could add to the Federal budget deficit, would not say where those cuts would be made.
"My opponent agrees with this in principle," Mr. Bush told several hundred students who gave him an enthusiastic greeting for his morning appearance at the New Jersey school. "But when you get to the details we really do have a vast philosophical difference. I believe we can pay for this new job training offensive without raising taxes on people or increasing overall Government spending."
Mr. Bush toured the school with Labor Secretary Lynn Martin and asked students and an instructor questions about the maintenance of diesel engines.
Torie Clarke, the Bush campaign press secretary, said Mr. Clinton's plan to create jobs would impose a 1.5 percent payroll tax. "He would destroy jobs to supposedly create jobs," she said.
Clinton campaign officials said today that the President's proposals were a poor attempt to mimic Mr. Clinton's record on job training without explaining how he would pay for it.
In his economic and education proposals, Mr. Clinton has called for job and apprenticeship training, including programs for high school graduates who do not go on to college, and for workers who lose their jobs because of reductions in military spending.
The Clinton proposal would require businesses with 50 or more employees to devote 1 1/2 to 2 percent of its payroll to job training.
 
Old and New Ideas
 Mr. Bush's proposal incorporates several programs that already exist or have already been proposed by the Administration. Some provisions are essentially the Administration's response to criticism of the recently signed North American Free Trade Agreement. Unions criticized the pact as neglecting the hundreds of thousands of American workers who fear they could lose their jobs because of increased imports from Mexico and the possible shift of some manufacturing jobs to Mexico, where the wages are lower.
Mr. Bush's plan would apply to workers who have lost their jobs, who have been notified that their jobs are being eliminated and workers in industries who fear job losses in the future.
These people could get vouchers of up to $3,000 a year to refine their job skills or learn new ones. These vouchers could be used at colleges, trade schools or training institutions. Workers would also be eligible for counseling and job-search assistance.
In addition, workers who had lost their jobs, had exhausted their unemployment insurance and were in retraining programs would be eligible to receive Federal assistance until until they found a job.
The President's plan would combine and restructure two programs that the Administration has been seeking to overhaul: the Economic Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Assistance and the Trade Adjustment Assistance Acts.
Administration officials said the Government now spends about $740 million a year for job training. That would increase to roughly $2 billion a year over the next five years.
The new plan calls for other additional spending to expand youth job programs and establish a Youth Training Corps to train poor young people in conservation and environmental work. It includes a drug treatment plan under which those who completed the program would get priority status for admission to the training corps.
The program is similar to one proposed by Senator David L. Boren, a Democrat of Oklahoma, and would admit 113,000 disadvantaged youths to vocational training or other programs each year, an increase of 43,000.
Mr. Bush's proposals were well received in New Jersey and by supporters at a rally here at the Chamber of Commerce at Warsaw Park Hall.
"If our nation is to succeed in this world economy," he said in New Jersey, "we cannot afford to waste the talent of one single worker."
In Ansonia, about 10 miles northeast of Bridgeport, Mr. Bush recalled his achievements abroad and then said it was time to emphasize domestic problems. "And so now the challenge for this country is to bring that spirit home, from Warsaw, Poland, to Warsaw Park and to focus this great nation on the mission ahead."

HEADLINE: Europeans Cooling on Bosnia Partition

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Two days before the start of international talks on ending the fighting in the former Yugoslav republics, European leaders appear to be backing away from a policy of partitioning Bosnia and Herzegovina along ethnic lines as an expedient way to curtail the violence, a senior Bush Administration official said today.
The two-day conference on the Balkans, sponsored by the European Community and the United Nations, will take place here in London on Wednesday and Thursday. 
 A shift by the Europeans on the division of Bosnia would set the stage for the United States to promote its more difficult long-haul policy of excluding Serbia from international affairs while destroying its economy through tougher sanctions.
The Administration and the Bosnian Government strongly oppose the partition policy that Europeans call "cantonization," saying it would reward Serbian aggression and send the wrong message to other armed ethnic groups across Europe and Asia.
 
Eagleburger Takes Over
 The Acting American Secretary of State, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, arrived here today on his first full day in charge to lead the American delegation to the talks. Mr. Eagleburger, a former Ambassador to Yugoslavia, speaks Serbo-Croatian and knows many of the participants in the warfare now tearing apart what used to be Yugoslavia.
On his flight here, the Secretary said he would not remain in office beyond this coming January, the end of President Bush's term.
Referring to Inauguration Day, he continued: "I do not intend to be employed by the United States Government after Jan. 20 next year, no matter what happens, and so my objective is to keep things on as even a keel and get as much accomplished as I can."
At the London talks, the Administration is expected to call for the establishment of a high-level, permanent body drawn from the European Community and the United Nations to police Belgrade's conduct under rules to be established in Security Council resolutions. This body would provide the continuity that is now missing from sporadic and largely unsuccessful efforts to deal with the Balkan crisis.
The plan is not dissimilar to the policy of putting steady, intrusive pressure on Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi President, making him an international pariah under a reinvigorated United Nations and subjecting his country to continual oversight.
Iraq, as well as the Balkans, will be on the agenda Tuesday when Mr. Eagleburger is scheduled to hold talks with European leaders, including the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev.
The Balkan conference is expected to discuss the deployment of troops to insure the delivery of relief supplies to Bosnia. The Administration, which has pledged air and naval support, wants troops on the ground to operate under United Nations command, a senior official said. Britain and France have promised to send contingents; the United States has not.
Administration officials attending the conference want to explore ways to tighten sanctions against Belgrade and to curtail the smuggling of vital supplies to Serbia along the Danube River.
The senior official said that there was "some fairly substantial evidence" of a private smuggling trade in violation of sanctions. Officials say they plan to look into reports that regional governments or their leaders might be involved in smuggling.
The Balkan conference is expected to begin discussing the needs of about two million refugees who will have to be housed and fed through the coming winter. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will hold a pledging conference in September to raise money for the task.
 
Appeal to Muslims
 The senior Administration official said that Muslim nations are being asked to give generous help to fellow Muslims in Bosnia, who have borne the brunt of the war.
The official said that in addressing the fighting in Yugoslavia, the Administration assumes that there are no quick fixes and that "there are limits to our ability to influence these events."
The official mentioned that while Serbs are the aggressors in the Balkans, "Serbia is not the only party to this dispute that needs to have its conduct examined."
There is some evidence, the official said, that Croats, too, have been doing "some unacceptable things and that Muslims in Bosnia on occasion are taking potshots at people when they expect that this will lead to a charge that it's the Serbians that are doing it."
The Serbian Government, led by President Slobodan Milosevic, backs ethnic Serbian forces carving up Bosnia and Croatia. Mr. Milosevic is reported likely to be present at the London conference.
Even if a cantonization is rejected there, the American official said, this does not solve the problem of how to get the Serbs out of areas they now hold.
"But they need to understand that in the end that's what they're going to have to come to," the official said, adding that "one of the things the Serbs should get through their heads is that history doesn't end tomorrow."

HEADLINE: A Surprise For Schools On Budgets

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Many school superintendents across the city have found they are receiving significantly less money than they expected for the coming school year and are angry they will be forced to increase class sizes and trim staff.
In part, their disappointment reflects a letdown after the announcement last month of a budget agreement that Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez and Mayor David N. Dinkins said virtually eliminated a $120 million shortfall hovering over the school system. They promised that increases in class size would be averted. 
 But yesterday Mr. Fernandez acknowledged in a memorandum to the 32 superintendents that some economies will be necessary because the school system did not receive as much as it hoped from the city to cover increases in student enrollment and increases in the cost of supplies. However, he said, the school system's predicament is not as dire as some superintendents are making it out to be.
Mr. Fernandez did not accuse the city of reneging on its deal. his statement seemed to imply that the initial claims the Board of Education made about that deal may have been exaggerated.
 
'Playing With the Numbers'
 Max Messer, superintendent of District 8 in the east Bronx and the head of the city's Association of Superintendents, said that a few days after the announcement he received a budget that had 10 percent less cash for instruction than last year, $41 million compared with $45.6 million.
"Someone is playing with the numbers," he said, echoing the comments of his counterparts in perhaps half the city's 32 school districts.
Cuts of that magnitude, he said, would force him to lose 6 to 10 assistant principals and as many as 6 guidance counselors. Some schools, he said, would be forced to fill one class at each grade level with more students than contractual ceilings allow.
Several district superintendents said they had received essentially the same allocations as last year. But, they said, with inflation, enrollment increases and a more expensive payroll, that money would have to stretch further. A few superintendents, however, are breathing a sigh of relief that they will not have to endure another round of punishing cutbacks.
"I think we feel it's basically about the same as last year," said Andrew Lachman, assistant to Anthony J. Alvarado, the superintendent of District 2 in Manhattan, of his district's real spending power.
News of the complaints by the superintendents elicited an expression of irritation by City Hall at the Board of Education's leadership. Jennifer Kimball, a spokeswoman for Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, said that Mr. Steisel felt he had been assured by Mr. Fernandez and H. Carl McCall, president of the seven-member Board of Education, "that there would not be such an impact" on class sizes or staff.
"If they need more money, they will have to find internal savings," Ms. Kimball said after speaking to Mr. Steisel at his vacation retreat.
Yesterday, the Educational Priorities Panel, one of the city's leading educational advocacy groups, released a list of 16 districts it said had seen their instructional budgets drop between 3 and 13 percent.
"It's going to mean there's going to be less assistant principals, less counselors and in some districts it's going to be larger classes," said Noreen Connell, the panel's executive director.
She warned that some poor districts will be forced to channel Federal and state money for remedial education into standard classroom services. That, she said, would not only be a violation of government regulations but would deprive the districts of the extra reading and mathematics tutoring the children need.
 
Fitting the Formula
 The difference in how districts have been responding to their allocations, which are determined by a set formula, may have something to do with different factors the districts face. Districts that had few teacher retirements this year -- and thus did not hire many low-salaried novice teachers -- are suddenly finding they have to use the same pool of money to meet a more expensive payroll.
Districts that have had greater than anticipated enrollment increases have to staff more classes with the same instructional budget. Districts that have lost enrollment may find their budget cut from the levels of the previous year.
Mr. Fernandez wrote the superintendents yesterday that "although our stated objective was to eliminate any further budget cuts, we could not nor did we guarantee that result."
The agreement with the city, he said, will eventually provide the school system with over $400 million in new revenues and accruals from previous years that it had never been allowed to count before. But for the present even that sum "is insufficient to keep the board's budget intact."
 
Fernandez Promises Help
 Mr. Fernandez promised to have experts from his staff help superintendents find ways of minimizing the pain, although many superintendents warned that students would feel pain.

No Praise, Please! He Wants to Be the Premier

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Of all the names being bandied about these days as potential prime ministers, one evokes a special tingle -- depending on your vantage point -- of either hope or horror.
Zhu Rongji, a former rightist who has spent more years in disgrace than in power, is the fastest-rising star in China's political firmament. But Mr. Zhu, a fluent English-speaker and aggressive advocate of economic change, faces a horrendous image problem within the party leadership: admirers abroad have affectionately dubbed him "China's Gorbachev." 
 This helps Mr. Zhu about as much as it would benefit President Bush for China's hard-liners to hail him as "America's Mao Zedong."
"You're not going to write a story saying how great Zhu Rongji is, are you?" a Chinese official who likes Mr. Zhu asked reproachfully. "Because whenever there's an article like that, he gets whacked politically."
 
Specter of Gorbachev
 Vice President Wang Zhen, an acid-mouthed octogenarian who peppers his conversations with village expletives, is said to have warned colleagues last year that "there is a Gorbachev sleeping beside us." Mr. Wang did not mention any names, but that's the kind of comment that would have Politburo members craning their necks to look at Mr. Zhu.
Still, the 63-year-old Mr. Zhu (whose name is pronounced joo rong jee) has managed to survive both the attacks and the compliments. In his spacious, air-conditioned second-floor office, just inside the north gate of China's park-like leadership compound of Zhongnanhai, Mr. Zhu has amassed prestige and authority along with the calligraphy that he hangs on the wall.
Named a Deputy Prime Minister last year, Mr. Zhu is one of several contenders hoping to replace Prime Minister Li Peng when his five-year term expires early next year. It is unclear, however, if the position will be vacant; Mr. Li is a skilled tactician who is fighting for a second term.
"Zhu Rongji is doing really well right now," said a family member of a top official. "But in China, the better things look for you, the worse your prospects really are. It's the bird in front of the flock that gets shot."
Some officials say the present fragile consensus at Beidaihe, the beach resort where China's elderly leaders are playing bridge and deciding the nation's future, is to allow Mr. Li to retain the post of Prime Minister. But they say that even according to this plan, Mr. Zhu would become first deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, so that he would be breathing down Mr. Li's neck.
"Even if Zhu Rongji isn't made Prime Minister, it may not matter so much," said a party member who has discussed policy with Mr. Zhu. "Because in any case, he'll be in charge of economic policy."
When summoned to Beijing last year from his previous post as Shanghai's Mayor, Mr. Zhu was given the task of unsnarling endless debt chains among state-owned companies. Partly because he was more successful than most people expected, he was named head of a new department called the Economic and Trade Office. It is emerging as a super-ministry with overall responsibility for managing the economy.
 
Nominal and Real Power
 Officials say that a deal has been struck for Mr. Zhu to vault onto the Politburo's standing committee, the nation's top policy-making body. It is exceeded in authority only by the so-called sitting committee of octogenarians who are nominally retired but continue to hold ultimate power.
The key to Mr. Zhu's success is that Deng Xiaoping, the nation's 87-year-old senior leader, is acting as his campaign manager. Mr. Deng has gone out of his way to praise Mr. Zhu's understanding of economics.
Mr. Zhu is disliked not only by some hard-liners, however, but also by many midlevel and senior officials. They find him a terror to work for. Extremely demanding, Mr. Zhu scolds people publicly in a society where it is considered more polite to stab them in the back.
"Some comrades are kind of muddled, and even when you point out some problems they figure they're in the right," Mr. Zhu said in a recent confidential speech, defending his style. "Even their self-criticisms are superficial. So then you've got to criticize those laggards by name.
"I also encourage everyone to criticize me," Mr. Zhu added in the speech, parts of which appeared in a restricted-circulation publication for party officials. "A couple of times, the criticisms were pretty nasty, and they weren't entirely fair. But I listened. Whether or not the complaints are correct, it's good for them to let off steam."
Mr. Zhu still speaks Chinese with a trace of a Hunan Province accent, reflecting his childhood there, but he studied electrical engineering at Qinghua University in Beijing and has spent most of his life in the capital. He took up Mao's invitation in 1956 to offer the party constructive criticisms, and a year later he fell victim, along with others who spoke out, to the "anti-rightist campaign."
By a fluke he escaped with extremely lenient punishment: he was allowed to hold on to a job in the central Government, but in disgrace. In 1978, when Mr. Deng came to power, Mr. Zhu was rehabilitated and climbed onto the fast track.
 
An Embarrassing Encounter
 While many Chinese believe that Mr. Zhu is different from other leaders, the last thing he wants is for this to be pointed out. When he once found himself seated beside an American correspondent at a dinner, he studied the reporter's name card and then asked accusingly, "Weren't you the one who wrote that article?"
The journalist asked if he meant an article that had appeared 10 months earlier, reporting that Chinese like Mr. Zhu much more than other leaders. "Yes, that article," Mr. Zhu said coolly, and he switched to English and quoted the headline word for word.
When the reporter acknowledged writing the article, Mr. Zhu paused for a moment in horror, and then pivoted. For the rest of the dinner he engaged in conversation exclusively with the person on his other side.

HEADLINE: Jet Sales to Saudis and Taiwan Weighed

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
With thousands of military industry jobs at stake in states like Ohio and California, the Bush Administration is poised to approve multibillion-dollar sales of fighter jets to Saudi Arabia and Taiwan that it once opposed or considered too controversial to pursue immediately, Administration officials say.
Under pressure to help the ailing military industry, the Administration in recent weeks has also dropped its longstanding opposition to spending $1.5 billion on the V-22 Osprey aircraft, which is being developed in Texas and Pennsylvania, and rescinded a Federal rule that hindered contractors seeking to convert military technology to nonmilitary uses. 
 The actions mark a significant shift by the Administration. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has tried to soften the impact of the end of the cold war for members of the armed services, but he has said the Pentagon is not a "social welfare agency" for workers in the military industry.
Administration officials say their recent decisions are not motivated by election-year politics, but they acknowledge that continuing military production in states with a lot of electoral votes is politically popular during a recession.
"The jobs argument has never been more powerful than it is now, with the economy the way it is," said one Defense Department official.
Indeed, the Administration has in recent months affirmed a directive to United States embassy workers to help American military contractors with their sales. The contractors had complained that diplomats helped other American businesses dealing abroad but not their industry.
 
Promoting Sales
 "Word has gotten around the overseas establishment that Washington is appreciative of efforts to promote military sales as well as commercial sales," said Joel L. Johnson, an official of the Aerospace Industries Association, an industry group.
The Administration's two most significant decisions involve a proposed $5 billion sale of 72 F-15 fighter planes to Saudi Arabia and a proposed $4 billion sale of about 150 F-16's to Taiwan.
Senior Administration officials say that Washington is still considering the merits and timing of both sales. "There has been no decision made" about the Saudi sale, Acting Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said in an interview on Thursday.
But other Administration officials, as well as military industry officials, lawmakers and senior Congressional aides familiar with the arms sales, say that the Administration is leaning in favor of both deals.
 
Worry About Peace Talks
 The question of whether to sell the F-15's to Saudi Arabia dates to early this year, when the Saudis formally asked to buy 48 F-15E and 24 F-15H planes.
The F-15E, an advanced air-to-ground version of the F-15, was used by the Air Force in the Persian Gulf war to attack Iraqi targets on the ground. The F-15H is a two-seat version of the F-15. But industry officials said the Saudi sale would probably involve 72 F-15S's, a version of the F-15E with less capable radar.
The Administration was cool to the Saudi request, although it supported the sale to a valued ally. The State Department did not want to jeopardize the incipient Middle East peace talks. Washington was negotiating to provide loan guarantees to Israel if Israel froze construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Since then, however, the sale's chances have improved: Several aerospace companies, union officials and Congressional supporters of the sale mounted a major lobbying effort. A new government in Israel reached agreement with Washington on the loan guarantees, and the peace talks, which resumed here today, appear able to withstand a controversy over arms sales. And in the United States, at least for now, concerns over arms proliferation in the Middle East have given way to domestic worries.
 
20,000 Jobs at Stake
 McDonnell Douglas, the St. Louis contractor that builds the F-15, has no new orders for the plane beyond the 45 that will be delivered to the United States Air Force beginning in 1994. Unless the Saudi sale is approved, the company says its production line will close. McDonnell Douglas officials said 1,000 workers have already been laid off as F-15 production declines and commercial aircraft orders dip.
The officials say as many as 20,000 aerospace jobs could be lost, including those of subcontractors in Connecticut and Southern California, by early next year if the Administration does not approve the Saudi sale this summer.
Congress reviews all proposed arms deals and can reject them. In the past, some Democrats with military plants in their districts opposed arms sales to the Middle East, but many now support the deals to help employment at home.
To take advantage of this sentiment before the November elections and to complete the Congressional review before lawmakers recess in October, the Administration needs to notify Congress of the sales in the next week or so, Congressional aides said.
Opponents of the Saudi sale concede that Mr. Bush has enough votes in Congress to allow the sale to go through. "In a tough economy, the sale would be tougher to block," said Representative Mel Levine, a California Democrat who is a leading opponent of arms sales to the Arab countries.
 
Surprise at Taiwan Deal
 The Administration's reconsideration of selling F-16's to Taiwan took many industry and Congressional officials by surprise. Mr. Bush said in an interview by a network of Texas radio stations on July 30 that the United States was re-examining the sale of F-16's, built by the General Dynamics Corporation in Fort Worth.
General Dynamics, which has already announced that 5,800 jobs would be cut by 1994 because of declining F-16 production, said 3,000 jobs could be saved if the Taiwan sale was approved. Subcontractors, particularly in Ohio and Maryland, would also save several thousand jobs, company officials said.
Unlike the Saudi sale, the F-16 sale would face virtually no opposition from Democrats or Republicans in Congress, lawmakers said, even though the Administration would be reversing a 10-year policy against selling warplanes to Taiwan. In 1978, 29 years after the Nationalist Chinese government fled from the mainland to Taiwan, the United States recognized the government in Beijing as the legitimate Chinese government, and four years later it agreed to phase out arms sales to Taiwan.
Selling F-16's to Taiwan could jeopardize American relations with China, which has bought Russian-built Su-27 fighters. But most Congressional officials said Mr. Bush's close ties with Beijing would survive the sale to Taiwan, which wants to replace its aging fleet of American-built F-5E's and old F-104's.
As an American official familiar with both the Taiwan and Saudi sales said, "The driver of this is the politics and economics of it, not the national security issue."

An Espresso Rush in the Northwest

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GOLD BAR, Wash., Aug. 19

 BODY:
In the beginning there was just coffee, black or with cream. About 35 cents a cup. Refills free. And the finest cup of joe in the land came from the timber towns of the Cascade Mountains, or so went the legend that grew with the television series "Twin Peaks."
But caffeine is not so simple anymore in this valley cut by the cold flow of the Skykomish River, about 50 miles northeast of Seattle. Only a handful of cafes remain where waitresses call everybody Sweetie and pour the old-fashioned bottomless cup. 
 In its place is the snort of loggers and backpackers alike: espresso. In this valley alone, there are 14 espresso outlets, including at least four drive-though booths. Perhaps only bungee-jumping, advertised from cranes along the edge of the road, has made for a more startling addition to the roadside attractions of United States Highway 2.
This development may not affect family values or the cost of a 2-by-4, but it surely says something about rural America.
In the town of Sultan, just a few miles west of here, men with chainsaws in the front seats of their cars and missing fingers used to plant themselves in the Dutch Gap Restaurant to drink coffee by the quart before venturing out for a day's work in the woods.
No more. In February, a drive-through espresso booth opened up across the street from the Dutch Gap -- the third such espresso stand in town to open within the last year. The Coop 'n' Cone Kitchen and a gas station had also added espresso to their respective menus of fried chicken and unleaded gasoline.
Within a month, people started getting hooked on shots of steam-processed coffee, for $1.65 a pop. By this summer, Scott Jeffries was selling up to 300 drinks a day from his booth.
"It's an addiction," said Mr. Jeffries, "and I'm a legal pusher."
This week, on a typical morning, there was a line of pickup trucks outside the Sultan drive-through espresso booth while the Dutch Gap was largely empty. Sullen-faced men in baseball hats ordered from a menu with a dozen variations on espresso.
They could choose from lattes (pronounced LAH-tay), a blend of expresso and steamed milk), single or double, caffeinated or decaffeinated, iced or hot, with fat or low-fat milk, and a bewildering assortment of cappuccinos and cafe mochas -- or simply plain espresso.
"It's gotten to the point where some people come through for three of them a day," said Mr. Jeffries. "They say if they go too long without a latte, they get a headache."
Just a few miles north of here, a similar pattern has taken hold in the town of Granite Falls, another hamlet built by loggers and miners in the era when brawniness was king. The True Value hardware store added a bright copper $5,000 Italian espresso machine last year, setting up shop amidst the bins of galvanized nails and drill bits. Soon enough, as many people were coming in for espresso as they were for hardware.
The Pacific Northwest is fast becoming known as a sort of "latte-land," as Jean Godden, a columnist for The Seattle Times, calls it. About five years ago, the first few espresso stands started appearing on Seattle streets. Now, there is a booth on virtually every downtown corner.
But few people ever thought the fever for steamed milk and high-potency coffee would spread to the tough-guy timber towns of the Cascades.
The economics, from the seller's point of view, may be one thing driving the expansion. It costs between $5,000 and $10,000 for a good multiple-spigot espresso machine. But after the machine is paid for, the profits pour in. Espresso vendors, once thought of as poor, suffering souls who sat in the rain, find they can make up to $150,000 a year on a single stand.
But that does not explain why so many people, from all walks of life, would give up the ancient routine of slow-sipping coffee in the morning for the blast-hit effect of espresso.
In this valley, the icons have fallen fast. Zeke's Drive-In, a semi-world-famous burger joint just north of Gold Bar, is the latest drive-in to add espresso. Now, it outsells the huckleberry milkshakes. The waitresses attribute espresso's lure to the stepped-up pace of American life, even on the back roads.
"Everybody just wants 'em to go," said Dana Goodwin, who works the window at Zeke's. "We hardly sell any plain old cups of coffee anymore."

MOTHER INDICTED IN DAUGHTER'S KILLING
A 68-year-old Queens woman who said she shot her crack-addicted daughter to death after enduring years of lies, thefts and threatening demands for money has been indicted on manslaughter charges. But by declining to bring the most serious charge, murder, the grand jury has opened the way for a possible plea bargain that would allow her to avoid prison. A1.
 
Indictment reflects a growing tendency to recognize strain of crime, experts say. B3.
 
NEW INCINERATOR SEEN AS LIKELY
Mayor Dinkins is virtually assured of prevailing ultimately in the City Council on his long-term garbage-disposal plan, which includes building a new incinerator in Brooklyn, two senior Council staff members say. The Mayor and the Speaker have enough votes to succeed, they said, because even if a majority on the Council should reject the plan tomorrow, the opponents do not have enough votes to override a mayoral veto of that action. B3.
 
ACCESS TO COURTROOM SOUGHT
Opponents in the Woody Allen-Mia Farrow child-custody case have actually agreed on something as lawyers for both sides joined in trying to keep television cameras out of the courtroom. In a legal argument pitting public access to information against the children's right to privacy, lawyers for Mr. Allen and Ms. Farrow argued that the case involved potentially damaging evidence that should not be disclosed. But a lawyer for the New York Broadcasters Pool, a media professional group that sought access to the proceedings on behalf of Court TV, said it was already too late for that. The judge denied access to cameras for a hearing today, but did not rule on the possibility of future televised hearings. B3.

TRENTON RATING ON DEBT LOWERED
Citing shortfalls in the New Jersey budget, Moody's Investors Service has downgraded the state's credit rating, moving it from Aaa, the top class, to Aa1, the second highest. The downgrading means the state will have to pay higher interest rates when it sells bonds to finance public works. Although Governor Florio said that he was disappointed by Moody's decision, he said that New Jersey still had the best rating in the Northeast. B5.
 
 A VISIT FROM THE PRESIDENT
President Bush came to Ansonia, Conn., a economically depressed onetime manufacturing center, where he was met by a crowd of 8,000. It was the biggest thing to happen to Ansonia in a long time, yet it hardly seemed enough for the many people who have lost their jobs and have not been able to find new ones. A18.

An unemployed cook has been arraigned in the slaying of Wayne Belliveau, a 23-year-old weightlifter and college football player who was shot during a melee at a beach in Rocky Point, L.I., on July 5. The arrest on Sunday came after a friend of Mr. Belliveau's spotted him at a Port Jefferson bar and called the police. B5.

HEADLINE: Citing Budget Shortfall, Moody's Lowers Rating on Trenton's Debt

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Citing shortfalls in the New Jersey budget, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the state's credit rating today, moving it from Aaa, the top class, to Aa1, the second highest.
The downgrading means the state will have to pay higher interest rates when it sells bonds to finance public works. New Jersey has more than $3.3 billion in general obligation debt outstanding, and more than $5 billion in total tax-supported debt. 
 Gov. Jim Florio said that he was disappointed by Moody's decision, but he said New Jersey still had the best rating in the Northeast.
Moody's said that since the 1988-89 fiscal year, economic forces have hurt the state's "once-substantial" surplus and projected "a sizable budget gap requiring resolution in fiscal 1994."
"Fiscal 1993 revenues and spending assumptions appear vulnerable to the same recessionary forces as those which undermined prior years' results," the New York firm said in a statement.
 
Larger Gap in 1994
 Both Governor Florio and State Treasurer Samuel F. Crane blamed the Republican-controlled Legislature for contributing to the lowered bond rating. They said the Republicans' decision to roll back the sales tax from 7 percent to 6 percent had cost the state $608 million in revenue and a budget adopted last month that cut $1.1 billion from Governor's proposed budget had further weakened confidsence.
"Clearly the state would have been in a stronger fiscal position if the Legislature hadn't removed $600 million in revenue," Mr. Crane said in a statement that was issued tonight.
Mr. Florio said his administration would do "everything possible to create jobs and to fight the effects of a bad deal" that he said the Republican budget gave the state.
The state's $14.6 billion budget for the 1993 fiscal year took effect July 1.
There have been projections of a $1.7 billion deficit in the 1994 budget, which begins next July 1. The Republican leadership, Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco and Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, have concurred with that projection and have said they will begin working on the 1994 budget within the next several weeks. Both men were unavailable for comment tonight.
The current budget includes no capital projects for which bonds would normally be issued.
The downgrading by Moody's follows a similar action last year by Standard & Poor's, another Wall Street rating firm.

HEADLINE: Immigrants Swindle Their Own, Preying on Trust;
Race, Religion and Ethnic Background Give Con Artists an Inside Track to Victims

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
When Satya Paul Gupta sold his share in a gas station in Mount Kisco, N.Y., he knew exactly what to do with the $80,000 he netted. He turned every penny over to Deepak Gulati, a compatriot featured as an expert on the "You and Your Money" segment of a television program aimed at New York's Indian immigrants.
Mr. Gupta, who is 58 years old, said he had "greedy faith" that his life savings would be safe with a fellow Indian, particularly the soft-spoken television celebrity with an office on Madison Avenue and an offer of what amounted to 12 percent yearly interest on four-month promissory notes, or I.O.U.'s. 
 But he was mistaken. Unbeknownst to Mr. Gupta, he was buying into a modern version of what Government investigators call an affinity scheme, where crooks and victims are linked by religion, race or ethnicity. Swindling fellow immigrants is an age-old American phenomenon, but recent fraud schemes have made wide use of media geared toward immigrants. With new foreign-language cable TV shows, newspapers and Yellow Pages, immigrant swindlers can reach a wider pool of potential investors, thus rising to an ever grander level of financial chicanery.
In the last five years, the Securities and Exchange Commission has investigated seven fraud schemes involving immigrants lured by one of their own into a fraudulent American dream. Swindlers have targeted Indians (twice), Poles (twice), Salvadorans, Chinese and Vietnamese, and investor groups have lost from $1 million to $34 million.
"The numbers are mind-boggling," said Jeffrey R. Zuckerman, an S.E.C. lawyer in New York.
Mr. Gulati, a 43-year-old native of New Delhi, pleaded guilty last month to defrauding fellow immigrants of at least $3.2 million. Federal prosecutors say that about 100 Indian and Pakistani investors, including Mr. Gupta, had bought his 12 percent promissory notes, which were not registered, insured or backed by collateral. In a classic Ponzi, or pyramid, scheme, Mr. Gulati continually used proceeds from new investors to pay interest to earlier investors. In such schemes, the pyramid usually collapses when the pool of new investors dries up, or when the swindler is caught.
 
'My Greedy Faith'
 "He was of our kind, and he wouldn't cheat us, or so I thought," said Mr. Gupta, who lives in Sunnyside, Queens. "But I was a damn fool, and now my wife is cussing me. After 35 years of hard work in this country, we may have lost everything because of my greedy faith in Deepak Gulati."
Mr. Gulati did not return telephone calls to his office and home.
The original Ponzi artist, Carlo Ponzi, engineered one of the first truly ambitious affinity schemes of the 20th century. In the early 1920's in Boston, Mr. Ponzi targeted his fellow Italian immigrants, including his own family members, his parish priest and players at a local boccie court. Eventually reaching beyond Italian immigrants, Mr. Ponzi persuaded some 20,000 investors to give him about $10 million before his scheme collapsed and he was jailed. He died a 66-year-old pauper in Rio de Janeiro in 1949.
 
Confidence Games And New Arrivals
 Forty-three years after Mr. Ponzi's death, a diverse group of schemers is following in his footsteps, preying on the trust of newcomers to the country.
Early last year, in the largest recent case, about 1,200 Eastern European immigrants, most of them Polish, lost $34 million in a Ponzi scheme in New York run by Eugene R. Karczewski, a prominent Polish businessman in Brooklyn, and his son, Eugene Jr., Federal prosecutors said. Last month, the father was sentenced to five years in prison and the son to three years. The Karczewskis, who claim they are now virtually broke, were also fined $15 million and ordered to pay back the immigrants they cheated. Many of them lost their life savings after falling for advertisements on Polish television programs that promised 14 percent interest on investments supposedly secured by mortgages.
"As the economy gets tighter, those on the margin, like immigrants, tend to be more susceptible to deals that are just too good to be true," said William R. McLucas, director of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division in Washington. "My sense is that there's been a definite increase in the volume of fraud based on religious, racial and ethnic identification."
Immigrants are particularly vulnerable because they are often uncomfortable with mainstream American banks and unaware of investment services, authorities said. And illegal immigrants are the most easily conned -- and the most likely to lose everything.
In Washington, D.C., Salvadoran immigrants, many of them illegal, lost more than $7 million by handing over their savings to the Latin Investment Corporation. Latin Investment promoted itself as a bank in the Spanish-language Yellow Pages, S.E.C. officials said. Salvadoran immigrants appreciated the ease of doing their banking in Spanish, without having to supply Social Security numbers.
 
$2 Million Is Misappropriated
 What they did not know was that their bank was neither licensed nor insured. They also did not know that the Salvadoran owner, Fernando Leonzo, and his associates had misappropriated $2 million to buy themselves houses in the suburbs and finance personal businesses, S.E.C. officials said.
Unlike the Salvadorans in Washington, the Indians who entrusted their money to Mr. Gulati were legal immigrants and, for the most part, professionals. But that did not make them more resistant to a con.
"We are a first-generation immigrant community, and people feel safer within the confines of the community," said John Perry, editor of News India, a weekly published in Manhattan. "Had a sales pitch similar to Gulati's come from an American native, we would have been more naturally suspicious."
Mr. Gulati appeared every other weekend on "Vision of Asia," a variety program on WNJU-TV, Channel 47, widely watched by Indian and Pakistani immigrants. With a master's degree in business administration from the University of Chicago, Mr. Gulati was the featured financial expert during a segment called "You and Your Money." Although Mr. Gulati paid for his time on the air, the segment was never identified as a commercial, investors said. Mr. Gulati did, however, ask viewers to call (800) DGULATI to make reservations for the free seminars he was holding at Indian restaurants in the metropolitan area.
"When it comes right into your living room, you tend to accept it as the truth," Mr. Gupta said. "I swear by God if I had not seen that guy every week on the TV -- if I had just received a letter in the mail -- I never would have trusted him."
Deepak Viswanath, the producer of "Vision of Asia" could not be reached for comment.
 
Feeling the Sting Of a Swindle
 Even a business school professor in Manhattan fell for Mr. Gulati's pitch, investing $10,000 in the 12 percent notes.
"I usually approach things with a certain method," the professor said. "But because he was Indian -- it influenced me. It made me not think about things I'd usually think of, given my profession. Being swindled like this makes me feel rather stupid."
Like most investors who were interviewed, he spoke on the condition of anonymity.
In "Dear Client" letters, Mr. Gulati solicited investments, ranging from $5,000 to $100,000, in notes that were "fully secured, collateralized and guaranteed." In meetings, he told clients that $150 in "liquid assets" backed every $100 invested in the notes, and that every account was insured to $500,000 by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, an insurance program run by the securities industry. Those claims were false, S.E.C. officials said.
Mr. Gulati admitted to a former employee, Ravi Murarka, that there was no collateral. "Gulati gave me a lecture on greed, fear and how Wall Street 'really' works, and explained that 'everybody' on Wall Street steals," Mr. Murarka told investigators.
 
Using the Proceeds To Cover Mistakes
 Mr. Gulati also told Mr. Murarka that he used proceeds from the notes to "finance his mistakes" in other business ventures. S.E.C. officials said that Mr. Gulati poured profits from the notes into a business he owned, Digitech International, which sells telephone voice scramblers, tie-clip microphones, and other spy equipment.
Mr. Gulati, who falsely told investors he had worked for Merrill Lynch, promised that investments would be returned after four months unless a rollover, or reinvestment, was requested, former employees said. But investments were usually automatically rolled over, the employees said. Few clients demanded their money back because they were receiving their interest payments. When clients did try to reclaim their principal investment, Mr. Gulati instructed his salesmen to pressure them to remain. If that failed, he ordered the salesmen to redouble their efforts to sell the 12 percent notes, the former employees said.
When the S.E.C. froze Gulati & Associates' assets in February, the company owed investors $1.9 million. It had $17,000 on deposit at Citibank.
Mr. Gulati's scheme also involved the fraudulent sale of $1.3 million in shares in a limited partnership called Telecommunications Security Associates, the S.E.C. said.
"I believe he was a very good con man, never really overdoing it, always very reassuring" said a pediatrician who lost $50,000. "Myself, I'm very badly burned. But I almost forgot my own troubles when I spoke to an elderly woman who lost her whole life savings and is very, very depressed."
 
Defrauded Investors Make Their Claims
 Mr. Gulati, who lives on the Upper East Side, faces up to 5 years in prison when he is sentenced Oct. 14 in Federal District Court in Manhattan. He has already been ordered to repay $3.2 million and pay penalties of $5.7 million in a judgment won by the S.E.C.
The S.E.C. is trying to seize Digitech's inventory, estimated at about $800,000, to pay back defrauded investors. But the State Bank of India, which gave Mr. Gulati a $1 million line of credit starting in 1987, also claims the inventory as collateral. Mr. Gulati still owes the bank about $700,000, Federal prosecutors said. Prosecutors charged him with obtaining the credit by filing false documents, including lies about his net worth.
"He has definitely taken down some families," said Mr. Perry, the New India editor. "Others have lost the money for the college tuition of their children and the forthcoming marriages of their daughters."
Many investors believed that American regulatory agencies would be too vigilant to let something like this happen.
"In India, you certainly cannot do all these crook things, and still drive a Cadillac," Mr. Gupta said.
Mr. Gupta had intended to retire in India, where his $80,000, plus interest, would allow him to "live like a king."
Now he does not know what he will do. "I'm just out of luck," he said. "I don't have a pension. I don't even have life insurance."

G.M. Staff to Pay for Part of Health Benefits

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 24

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said today that as a cost-control measure, it would require white-collar workers to pay part of their health insurance.
The plan, which marks the first time the company has asked its employees to chip in for health care coverage, could be in place by Jan. 1. 
 "The new salaried employee plan will be, generally speaking, a flex plan and will provide coverage for routine, preventative and catastrophic health care, comparable to the level salaried employees or retirees have now," a spokesman said. But the level of deductibles and co-payments will also rise under the plan, which affects about 100,000 salaried employees and 90,000 retirees.
The spokesman declined to say how much GM would save by adopting the plan -- other than to say the savings will be significant -- or how much money each employee would have to pay for health care benefits. But he said monthly premiums would depend on the number of dependents and options.
He said the change pertained only to white-collar workers, retirees and their dependents in the United States. But G.M. is expected to discuss the issue with the United Auto Workers union in contract talks next year.
Last year G.M. spent $3.4 billion on health benefits -- an amount equal to $929 on every car sold in the United States.
The new plan will also allow employees to select different types of health care services, such as health maintenance organizations, which are less expensive than traditional plans but restrict services to a select group of medical staff.
Rising health-insurance costs have become a major source of strife between unions and management. In 1989, Three-fourths of all strikes involved worker objections to paying a larger share of insurance premiums.
In the 1970's, spending for medical care rose rapidly but was not out of line with inflation in other goods and services. In the 1980's, inflation cooled, but health care costs kept climbing and insurance premiums skyrocketed.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Calm After the Storm Seen for Insurance Rates

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
After battering South Florida with the fiercest blows of any storm in 35 years and now taking aim at the Texas-Louisiana Gulf Coast, Hurricane Andrew is likely to make a bad year of losses worse for many property insurers.
But analysts say the damages would have to be extraordinarily high to cause the insurance industry to raise rates substantially, possibly buoying their stocks. 
 The stocks of most property and casualty insurance companies slumped yesterday amid a weak bond market and fears that Andrew's legacy could push industry claim payouts near the record level of more than $7 billion set in 1989. That was the year of Hurricane Hugo, for which companies paid out $4.2 billion in claims, and the San Francisco earthquake, for which $1 billion was paid.
 
Catastrophes This Year
 In the first six months of this year, insured losses from damaging hailstorms in Texas, Kansas and Florida, the Los Angeles riots, the downtown Chicago flood and other catastrophic losses amounted to $3.7 billion, according to Property Claim Services, an industry trade group in Rahway, N.J.
But analysts say it is too early to make estimates on damage to South Florida and that Hurricane Andrew's toll would have to be far greater than from Hurricane Hugo to spur industry executives into raising rates substantially.
A rise in rates this year would end what has been an unusually long period of more than five years of gradual price reductions in commercial insurance rates. The previous "down" cycle for rates lasted from 1979 to 1984.
 
Pain Before a Rise
 "You need some pain before the industry is going to raise rates," said Gloria L. Vogel, insurance analyst at Lehman Brothers. "Clearly, a hurricane means additional losses for these companies. If it's enough to change psychology in the industry, it will be the catalyst that turns things around for the long term. But that remains to be seen."
But Thomas V. Cholnoky, insurance analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, thinks it will take more than one bad storm for rates to rise.
"I don't think the hurricane in itself is enough to turn the cycle," he said. "This bad news won't be bad enough."
He said investor hopes for rate increases could push the prices of insurance stocks higher in coming weeks after the full range of Hurricane Andrew's devastation is known. That happened late in 1989 after Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake struck.
"But when the realization set in that nothing was happening with pricing, the stocks gave back their gains, if not more," Mr. Cholnoky said.
Michael Frinquelli, insurance analyst at Salomon Brothers, said prospects for any lasting, significant change in stock values of property and casualty insurers for the next six to 12 months were "dull."
Stocks of property and casualty insurers have outperformed the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index in six of eight months so far this year, even though first-half profits lagged behind the period in 1991. Cigna, for example, said insurance losses more than tripled in the first six months this year from the period last year; at Safeco, weather-related payouts nearly doubled.
Yet in the stock market, the industry lost ground only in April and May amid concerns about the Los Angeles riots, with insured losses estimated near $1 billion.
The bond market, which rose in value earlier this year as interest rates descended through the year, explains much of Wall Street's moderately solid appetite for insurance stocks despite lower earnings. About 75 percent of the industry's assets are invested in bonds, and those values have risen handsomely.
Moreover, the sluggish economy has brought some relief for insurers from a slowdown in auto crashes, construction injuries and other high-volume staples of property and casualty underwritings, said Mr. Frinquelli of Salomon Brothers Inc.
Some of the biggest price gains posted in the industry this year through last Friday include US F& G, up 76 percent, to $12.75; Mercury General, up 55 percent, at $47.125; Geico, up 44 percent, to $57.50, and Cincinnati Financial, up 37 percent, to $49.25.
"If interest rates go down further, the industry's wealth will build faster and the market may respond to that," Mr. Frinquelli said. "But the market will react most positively when premium rates start rising. We simply now see no near-term prospect of that. The industry has too much capital."
In yesterday's trading, Geico fell 37.5 cents, to $47.125; Cincinnati Financial dropped 75 cents, to $48.50; Mercury General lost 87.5 cents, to $46.25, and USF & G lost 87.5 cents, to $11.875.
Ms. Vogel of Lehman Brothers said that insurers with the biggest exposure to losses in South Florida included State Farm, Cigna, Travelers and Allstate, a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Company. State Farm, for instance, has 23 percent of the home insurance market in Florida.
Shares of Cigna lost 62.5 cents yesterday, closing at $51; Travelers dropped 50 cents, to $20.625, and Sears lost 12.5 cents, to $41.375. State Farm is a mutual company and does not have publicly traded stock.
Charles B. Gates of the First Boston Corporation said that if huge losses from Hurricane Andrew began a spate of rising rates for commercial lines, the shares of Marsh & McLennan, the world's largest insurance broker, would benefit.
Profitability and dividend yield at Marsh & McLennan easily exceed market averages, and the firm's consulting arm would help earnings in an improving economy, Mr. Gates said. Marsh & McLennan shares lost $1 yesterday, to $78.25.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Tsongas Attacks Bush Plan But He's Tepid on Clinton's

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Aug. 24

 BODY:
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts came down here today to help Gov. Bill Clinton do a bit of Bush-bashing. Or so the visit was touted.
He did bash the President, calling the tax cuts and other economic proposals that Mr. Bush offered at last week's Republican convention "cynical, outrageous nonsense" and asserting that Mr. Bush had lost the will and capacity to govern. 
But by the time he had unloaded all that, Mr. Tsongas had also managed to duck, weave and drolly chuckle his way around a solid endorsement of the economic proposals offered thus far by Mr. Clinton.
"Clearly it's not my plan," Mr. Tsongas said at one point, standing next to the man who bested him in the spring primaries.
Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton differed sharply back then over tax policy, with Mr. Tsongas opposing any cuts and Mr. Clinton favoring a cut for the middle class. But after Mr. Clinton locked up the Democratic nomination, the two men made their peace and Mr. Tsongas said he would support the Governor in the fall.
He reiterated that support today, asserting that it was "staggeringly clear" that Mr. Clinton was the preferable candidate in the race. "Bill Clinton is very bright," he said.
 
Political Dance
 But what of Mr. Clinton's economic plan, asked the reporters gathered at the Governor's Mansion here.
Not to worry, Mr. Tsongas replied, predicting that Mr. Clinton would "do the right things" as President because, he said, the Governor had good instincts and, well, unlike Mr. Bush, had no White House record to defend to the dogged, wrongheaded end.
Mr. Tsongas won more than 550 delegates before dropping out of the 1992 race. With the Bush-Clinton race tightening, Mr. Clinton is likely to need all the support from Tsongas backers that he can get in the fall.
Mr. Tsongas mentioned his supporters several times today. But he kept sliding away from giving them any real guidance on what to think about the Clinton economic plan.
About the closest he came to a judgment on the plan, which includes some new job-creation proposals and, since the primaries, a scaled-back tax cut for the middle class, was to characterize it as having "movement" and "evolving" in a positive direction.
"I intend to work with Governor Clinton and to press my views upon him and the people around him," Mr. Tsongas said. "That has been the case for several months and that will continue. I'm not one who is in the position of saying, 'Well, the kinds of things I advocated are past history.' "
Was that a way of saying, a reporter asked, that the Clinton plan did not go far enough, that the Governor should move closer to Mr. Tsongas's point of view?
Mr. Tsongas did not get a chance to answer.
Mr. Clinton, who had watched all of this impassively, nipped forward to the microphone, mustered a wan smile, and declared:
"Yeah. That's a way of saying it."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Vice President;
New Angle In the Jabs At Clinton

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWPORT NEWS, Va., Aug. 24

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle suggested today that Gov. Bill Clinton, who has signed four death warrants, was soft on capital punishment because he had mentioned Gov. Mario M. Cuomo as a possible appointee to the Supreme Court. The New York Governor has vetoed death penalty bills in each of the 10 years he has been in office.
At the same time, Mr. Quayle said, support for the death penalty should not be a litmus test in the selection of Supreme Court Justices. But when asked at a news conference in Knoxville, Tenn., why it was then bothersome that Mr. Clinton might name a death penalty opponent to the High Court, Mr. Quayle would only say that he was trying to make a point about Mr. Clinton's consistency. 
 "His party is divided on this issue," Mr. Quayle said. "So Bill Clinton says, 'Well, I'm for capital punishment but, by the way, those of you who oppose capital punishment, be reminded that one of my first appointments would be somebody like Mario Cuomo, if not Mario Cuomo, and of course you all know that he's an outright opponent of the death penalty.' It's having it both ways. That's why he has the name Slick Willie."
George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director, dismissed the comments as "just more silliness from Dan Quayle."
"Governor Clinton is the only candidate in the race who has carried out the death penalty, and Dan Quayle's just trying to create an issue where none exists," he said.
Mr. Quayle made his remarks in front of Knoxville's police academy before a backdrop of uniformed officers, a setting that has become a political advance man's cliche. His mission was to elevate crime as an issue in a campaign that has been dominated by debates on the economy and values.
The Vice President cited Justice Department statistics showing that per capita crime rates in Arkansas had increased during Mr. Clinton's tenure, and that they had increased more significantly than in the country as a whole.
Mr. Quayle also campaigned today in Newport News, where he told shipyard workers that the Democrats would "take a meat ax" to national defense.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Maytag Sees A Profit Drop In 3d Period

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Maytag Corporation, citing slack demand and intense competition, said yesterday that it expected third-quarter earnings before one-time charges to drop one-third from the $24.2 million, or 23 cents a share, of net income it reported for the period a year earlier.
To address those conditions, Maytag said it would reorganize its North American and European operations. 
 Leonard A. Hadley, president and chief executive of the Newton, Iowa, maker of home appliances, said in a statement that Maytag would take charges totaling about $95 million before taxes, or 57 cents a share after taxes. Maytag expects to recover the charge in about three years through improved profits, he added.
The company also said it would take a continuing after-tax quarterly charge of $4.5 million, plus one-time charges totaling $307 million, as it adopts, retroactive to Jan. 1, two accounting rules related to the costs of retirement benefits.
Maytag's disclosure did not sit well on Wall Street. Investors pushed down Maytag's shares almost 10 percent, or $1.375, to $12.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The reorganization is designed to streamline marketing and sales operations at a number of Maytag's most important business units, including Magic Chef, Jenn-Air and Hoover.
Maytag plans to consolidate Magic Chef's sales and marketing force into the Indianapolis headquarters of the Jenn-Air division; discontinue Jenn-Air's two-step method of selling through distributors, and pare back Hoover's European manufacturing operations.
Job cuts resulting from the reorganization will be minimal, said Maytag, which has 21 manufacturing operations in seven countries and employs 22,000 people.
Although Maytag cited generally weak economic conditions at home and abroad as a major cause of the lower earnings projection, analysts called the reorganization more a reflection on Maytag than on the state of the so-called white goods industry.
"Five to eight years ago Maytag was viewed as the premier company in this industry," said Jonathan L. Goldfarb of Merrill Lynch & Company. "But their profitability has been eroding consistently over the last couple of years. Certainly, if the economy was doing better, Maytag would be doing better. But these difficulties are much more particular to Maytag itself than the industry generally."
Indeed, after a very poor year in 1991, demand for major appliances like refrigerators, washing machines and microwaves appears to be firming. Data from the Association of Appliance Manufacturers indicate that in 1992 through July, shipments of major appliances had grown more than 6 percent from a year earlier.
A Maytag spokesman said that unit sales of major appliances had risen 3 percent to 5 percent through the first half. "Even though we are seeing sales go up, there is great pressure on profit margins," he said.
While conditions in the United States may be somewhat better, business in Europe continues to suffer.
The Hoover appliance and floor-care operations in Europe continue to lose money, Mr. Hadley said, citing excess capacity and the "unexpected further deterioration of economic conditions in the United Kingdom and other countries."
Mr. Goldfarb said that over the last few years, competitors like the General Electric Company of Fairfield, Conn., and the Whirlpool Corporation of Benton Harbor, Mich., have taken on Maytag in the margin-rich luxury-appliance category. Maytag's efforts to market lower-priced appliances have not proved terribly successful, he added.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Congressional Race;
Oklahoma Lawmaker Faces 4 Rivals and a Scandal

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY, Aug. 24

 BODY:
Representative Mickey Edwards plaintively folded his hands at his waist like a choir boy ready to confess as he recalled to a group of voters his 386 overdrafts at the House bank.
"If my own mother had been alive, even she would not have voted for me," Mr. Edwards, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House, said with a bittersweet grin. "My son Patrick told me, 'Now you've really screwed up.' " 
 Running neck and neck with two of four other candidates in Tuesday's Republican primary, the man who has epitomized Republican politics in Oklahoma for 16 years sought an understanding chuckle from his audience at the recent luncheon. Instead, it left him standing gamely in an unforgiving silence.
It was an awkward moment in an otherwise friendly event, where constituents nodded approvingly as Mr. Edwards listed all the military and social programs he has attracted to Oklahoma's Fifth Congressional District as a ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee.
 
A Proven Provider
 Voters in this diverse district, stretching from Oklahoma City's prosperous suburbs north through the flat wheat and oil fields to the Kansas border, are strongly opposed to Washington business as usual. But they are also uneasy about breaking with a proven provider, as shown by Mr. Edwards's climb in the polls in recent weeks, from a sure loser to a possible survivor, at least through the Sept. 15 runoff.
The primary contest has produced few policy differences between Mr. Edwards and his two principal opponents, Bill Price, a former Federal prosecutor, and State Representative Ernest Istook; all three are staunch conservatives who want to slash taxes.
Instead, the campaign has become a referendum on Congress itself. As Mr. Edwards tells voters, "I do not apologize for my incumbency," his opponents make slashing attacks on Congressional privileges and call for term limits for members of Congress.
Polls this year have suggested the complexity of voters' feelings about Congress around the country. Typically, they are disgusted with the institution for its overall performance, but they want their own representatives to protect or even expand their services.
One voter here, Ruby Wimsett, said she probably would not decide whom she would vote for in the primary until the moment she casts her ballot. As she watched five Shriners skid their dune buggies in tight figure eights in a rodeo parade in Ponca City, the 68-year-old unemployed cashier said: "I guess I think about the bank a little bit. Otherwise, I'd definitely vote for Mickey. He tries to help us."
 
'A Pig Is a Pig'
 A defining moment of the campaign came in a television debate on Aug. 14, when Mr. Istook accused Mr. Edwards of being a pork-barrel operator who drives up the Federal budget deficit.
"It's not pork," said Mr. Edwards, "if you're bringing jobs that will be created anyway and you have them in Oklahoma rather than West Virginia."
In response, Mr. Istook shot back, "A pig is a pig no matter whose pigpen it happens to be in."
Mr. Edwards's political problems began last spring, when he was identified as one of the 22 current or former House members who most abused their privileges at the now-defunct House bank. He first responded to the publicity over his 386 overdrafts by saying that he had been told he could draw against his next month's pay.
But the powerful reaction of indignation from his constituents forced him to return home for an "apology tour" of town meetings, and he has been apologizing ever since in radio and television commercials.
 
Bad Year for Incumbents
 Mr. Edwards is fortunate that reapportionment did not dismember his district, so he does not have to sell himself to new voters who have had no stake in his career.
But the national trend may be running against Mr. Edwards, as demonstrated by 16 primary defeats of House incumbents so far this year, the highest number since 1946. In a couple of cases the losses were caused by reapportionment, but the 1946 record will almost certainly be overcome by the time the primary season ends in early October.
Mr. Edwards says he cannot run away from his insider status, and the central message of his advertising campaign is: "I've always been there when you needed me. Now I need you."
The potency of his argument for reciprocity is underscored by the omnipresence of his commercials. He has the most ample campaign war chest of all the candidates, much of it provided by a local business community that appreciates Mr. Edwards's work for deregulation of the oil industry and against an automobile gasoline tax.
Both of his major opponents have held public office, but they take the approach of outsiders. They have generally preferred to attack Congress rather than Mr. Edwards directly, in part to avoid building up a sympathy vote for the incumbent.
 
'Family Values' Stessed
 As in the national campaign, both challengers have stressed "family values" in their campaign speeches and literature, hoping to win a strategic advantage over Mr. Edwards because of his well-publicized four divorces.
When Mr. Price and his wife, Mary, passed out campaign pamphlets in Oklahoma City last week, they attracted a generally positive reaction. But after meeting them, most voters spoke of Mr. Edwards as their Congressman, and said that after 16 years they have become accustomed to him.
"Mickey didn't come out well with the check scandal," sighed Donna Stroberg, a 28-year-old accountant, "But I've been over all pleased with his past performance." Then she added, "I'm not thrilled with any of the candidates."
Local Republican activists say they are concerned that a runoff could become more bitter and divisive, and open the possibility that a Democrat could win the seat in November. Seeing an opportunity, five Democrats are running in their own primary race.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 25.93 as World's Stocks Fall

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

 BODY:
Stock prices retreated around the world yesterday as the dollar's sharp fall spread concern about the unsettling consequences of a weakening American currency.
In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 25.93 points, to 3,228.17, and has now dropped 75 points in the last two trading sessions. Worse, major stock indexes dropped more than 2 percent yesterday in London, Paris, Zurich and Hong Kong, and 1.3 percent in Frankfurt. 
 Only in Tokyo, where the Nikkei index hit a six-year low last week, did share prices rebound, rising 2.5 percent. Gold prices climbed $4.30, to $341.60 an ounce, on the New York Commodities Exchange.
Traders and analysts expressed alarm at the diminishing price of the dollar, which fell to its third straight all-time low against the German mark yesterday. Despite renewed dollar-buying by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, the dollar fell to 1.4015 marks in New York, from Friday's close of 1.4295.
"The collapse of the dollar has unnerved market participants," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenhemier & Company. "It's mainly psychological, but it's also symptomatic of an economy that has no great vigor."
 
Shift in Funds
 The dollar's fall has been caused primarily by the yawning disparity between interest rates in the United States and Germany. This has caused investors to shift funds from dollars to marks to earn higher interest rates, and analysts do not see any near-term solution.
"There is no way to define how low the dollar can go," warned Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at the Dreyfus Corporation. "Government policy can't stop it. Only when it burns out by itself will there be a turnaround."
Chris Bourdain, manager of foreign exchange sales at Credit Suisse New York, added : "Intervention in the current environment is not really going to help. We may have even further down to go."
For stock markets in the United States, Mr. Hoey said, the dollar's skid has eroded the high availability of cash, which had fueled the markets since last December. But he argued that the weakness in economies in Asia and Europe would, by the end of the year, make the American recovery look strong by comparison.
"Are we in a dollar crisis? You bet," he said. "Is it stoppable before it burns out? No. But will it still be dropping a year or even six months from now? I don't think so."
In London yesterday, the Financial Times Stock Exchange index of 100 issues lost 54.6 points, or 2.3 percent, to 2,311.11, as investors bet that British interest rates, now at 10 percent, would rise.
Kevin Gardiner, an economist at S. G. Warburg & Company in London, said that although the Government had tried to reassure traders that no interest rate increase was planned, some rise seemed inevitable.
In New York, the stock market's retreat was unusually broad, as declining stocks outnumbered gainers by nearly 4 to 1, with 1,490 gainers to 399 losers. Trading on the New York Stock Exchange, however, was moderate, at 166 million shares, compared with 204 million on Friday.
Insurance stocks took a beating, as Hurricane Andrew raised expectations of costly damage. American International, Cigna and Aetna each fell.
Among smaller stocks, prices dropped even more sharply. The Nasdaq composite index fell 8.31 points, or 1.5 percent, to 555.39, while the Russell index of 2,000 stocks dropped 2.52 points, to 187.48. The American Stock Exchange index fell 3.41 points, to 380.90.
The surge in gold prices was spurred at the session's opening by the decline in the dollar, said Richard McGraw, chief dealer at Credit Suisse New York. But he added that most of the day's buying came from short-sellers, who had in recent weeks and months bet that the price would fall. Since gold has dropped steadily, the short-sellers were buying yesterday to lock in their gains.
As for the stock market, some analysts view the current spreading of gloom as a sign that the bottom is near.
"Like most markets, when you get toward the perception of a one-way risk, where everyone thinks it can only go down, that means you're getting close to a turnaround," said Mr. Hoey of Dreyfus.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Gold Rises $4.50 an Ounce On Weakness of the Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold prices climbed yesterday on the continued weakness of the dollar.
At the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $4.30 an ounce, to $341.60. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at $341.60 late yesterday, up $4.10 from Friday. 
 The dollar fell sharply again, continuing its plunge through record-low territory despite attempts by central banks to bolster its value. The dollar fell more than 4 cents against the British pound and about 3 pfennigs against the German mark.
The dollar's plunge helped push down stock and bond prices for the second straight trading day. But the falling dollar pushed gold prices higher. Because gold is quoted in dollars, when the dollar falls, gold becomes cheaper when bought with other currencies, attracting foreign buyers.
The dollar's value has dropped for much of this year amid concern about the American economy and the higher interest rates offered on investments in other countries.
Higher rates abroad mean that investments denominated in dollars earn less than if investors put their money in similar securities in other countries. That has lessened the dollar's appeal to global investors.
Dollar-buying on Friday and yesterday by many of the leading central banks, including the Federal Reserve, failed to do much to prop up the dollar.
The dollar fell to an all-time low against the German mark yesterday. In New York, one dollar bought 1.4015 marks, down from the low of 1.4315 marks that had been set on Friday. The dollar closed in London at 1.4050 marks, down from 1.4375 marks late Friday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 125.33 yen, down 1.12 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 124.65 yen. In New York, the dollar bought 124.60 yen, down from 125.75 yen late Friday.
In London, the British pound rose sharply to $1.9925, from $1.9480 late Friday. In New York, one pound cost $1.9920, up from $1.9560.
Silver prices fell in London to a late bid of $3.72 an ounce, from $3.76 late Friday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver for current delivery fell to $3.712 from $3.723.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Connecticut Visit;
Hard-Hit City Gets Glimpse of Bush

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANSONIA, Conn., Aug. 24

 BODY:
President Bush came to this depressed one-time manufacturing center this afternoon, said thanks for "a great send-off" to the thousands of people who had waited hours in a sweltering stadium, and promptly left, the blades of his helicopter flattening the ball field grass in a moment of Presidential pomp.
It was the biggest thing to happen to Ansonia in a long time, yet it hardly seemed enough for the many people who have lost jobs here and have not been able to find new ones. 
 "The whole state is down because of the cutbacks in military spending," said Joe Ardito, manager of a vacuum-cleaner store here, who was having lunch today in a coffee shop called "Good Morning America." "There are a lot of people around here who are hurting. When you go by our mall, for instance, on Main Street, it's really suffering because the people are suffering. There just isn't enough money around."
Ansonia, with 18,000 people, was booming just five years ago, many people here said today, when helicopters and other military supplies were being churned out by local manufacturers like Sikorsky. It was hard to buy a house then, and prices skyrocketed. Today, prices are down, and many of the storefronts are vacant.
 
Shouts and Counter-Shouts
 Most of those in the crowd of an estimated 8,000 at Andrew F. Nolan Stadium were Bush supporters, and many held placards that proclaimed "Bush Quayle 92."
Yet, amid the cheers and cries for "Four more years" that greeted the President as he stepped from his limousine to the waiting helicopter, there were people shouting "No more Bush."
Before coming to the stadium, Mr. Bush had spoken at a fund-raising luncheon in Middlebury and to business leaders and local Republican officials in Ansonia.
At one point during the wait for Mr. Bush (he was about an hour behind schedule), a local official tried to lead a chant that consisted solely of the words "George Bush." Booing from the people who had arrived with placards that declared "We need jobs" and other slogans drowned out the chant, and the official hastily asked the high-school band to play a few more peppy songs.
"After 40 years of Republicanism, I'm a Democrat this year," said Lynda Bluestein, who moved to Fairfield, Conn., this year from Orange County, Ca., and arrived at the event with her two teen-age children.
"I'm a one-issue voter, and I'm pro-choice," she said. "I am the perfect Republican, married to a doctor and I stayed home with my children. But we can't tolerate the last four years, especially the Republican Party and it's far-right wing."
One Ansonia resident, Kathy Crotto, said she was still undecided about whom to vote for. "I think Bush is good internationally," she said, "but as far as our economy is concerned, it's pretty terrible."
 
In Democratic Territory
 But John Coscia, a retired defense worker from Ansonia, defended the President. "I think George Bush comes across as a totally honest, sincere and dedicated person," he told The Associated Press. "I don't think, listening to Clinton and Gore, that they're going to wave some magic wand and put everybody back to work."
President Bush spent just five minutes at the stadium. He cut short his Connecticut campaigning to fly to Florida to inspect the damage from Hurricane Andrew.
In 1988, Mr. Bush lost Ansonia to Michael S. Dukakis by 30 votes. Voter registration in the city is overwhelmingly Democratic, but like many Connecticut residents, people in Ansonia have no qualms about crossing party lines, especially in a Presidential year.
Outside the stadium, an unemployed couple set up their own enterprise zone in their front yard to take advantage of the crowd and the heat. "I've been out of work for six months," said Stacey Treszi, a onetime manager for a city agency who was frying hot dogs and handing out cold cans of soda with her husband, David. When someone complained about the high prices -- $1 for a soda -- she replied, "These are Bush prices."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Times Company to Shut Suburban Atlanta Paper

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
The New York Times Company said yesterday that it planned to close The Gwinnett Daily News, a suburban Atlanta paper that it acquired five years ago.
The offices, equipment and subscription lists of the Gwinnett County paper are to be sold to Cox Enterprises Inc., publisher of The Atlanta Journal and Constitution. 
 The asset sale, involving two large companies, is subject to a review by the Justice Department. Consequently, said Walter E. Mattson, president and chief operating officer of the Times Company, no date has yet been set for the sale.
 
Battle for the Suburbs
 The move follows a bruising competition between The Daily News and The Journal and Constitution for readers in Atlanta's affluent and rapidly growing northern suburbs.
"We are proud of the fine job performed by our employees in Gwinnett," Mr. Mattson said. "They produced an excellent newspaper and fought a tough battle against a very aggressive competitor. Unfortunately, in spite of all their efforts, the newspaper consistently lost money with no hope of reversing those losses."
The proposed sale is expected to reduce the Times Company's third-quarter earnings by about $35 million after taxes, or 45 cents a share. The Times Company issued a statement saying that because it had earlier placed a hiring freeze on its Regional Newspaper Group, it would be able to offer jobs at other newspapers in the group to many of the 290 Gwinnett employees.
"The company had the hope, which proved to be unachievable, that the market dynamics could be changed," said Peter P. Appert of C. J. Lawrence, a Wall Street brokerage firm.
From the time The New York Times Company bought The Daily News in July 1987, the paper grew quickly, almost doubling its average daily circulation to 50,589 at the end of 1991. But the paper did not achieve the financial expectations reflected in the Times Company's investment, a purchase price of $90 million plus $40 million for new offices in 1990.
The recession held down advertising sales. Growth in Gwinnett County, which had been rapid in the 1980's, started to slow.
 
Responding to Competition
 Also, The Journal and Constitution "woke up to the competitive threat," Mr. Appert said. When The Daily News switched from afternoon to morning publication in May 1988, The Journal and Constitution, which have a combined daily circulation of more than 480,000, increased their coverage of the region to daily from weekly and distributed free newspapers in the area for several days.
The Daily News, which started daily publication in 1965, began publishing as a weekly in 1898 as The Gwinnett News-Herald.
The Times Company hired a newspaper broker, Dirks, Van Essen & Associates, to solicit bids for the paper. The Dirks firm spoke with more than 40 potential purchasers, but none wanted to keep the newspaper open, given the competition and market factors.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Are Shaken by Dollar's Fall

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The sinking dollar continued to rattle the American bond market yesterday, and foreign bonds also fell sharply, as Europe was hit by the uncertainty that the dollar is unleashing and by the threat of higher interest rates.
The corporate and municipal bond markets were also stunned, with several big new municipal issues halted because of the chaos in the Treasury markets. Among the delayed issues was a $666 million offering of revenue bonds by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York. Traders said several corporate financial officers who were ready to sell new securities had also pulled back for now. 
 While economists and analysts waited to see how much farther the dollar would fall and whether the Bush Administration would take any action, the 30-year American bond dropped more than a point and the average discount rates on three- and six-month bills, which had been at their lowest levels in years, leaped when they were auctioned yesterday. Prices also fell sharply in the corporate and municipal bond markets.
 
Too Much Supply
 With the auction of two- and five-year notes today and Wednesday and the hangover of supply from the big quarterly Treasury auction a week ago, the market seems to have more than it can handle at the moment. And the two auctions may not go well.
"There is a combination of bad factors in the market now," said one government securities trader. "The dollar is a real problem for the election process, for confidence and for the financial markets. People don't mind if it goes down. They just don't want it to get out of hand."
Despite repeated rounds of dollar buying by the Federal Reserve and a host of European central banks, the dollar plunged almost 2 percent against the German mark yesterday, ending in late New York trading at 1.4015 marks, its lowest close since the mark was created in 1948.
Long-term 10-year bonds in England were off about a point. The problem there is also currency. With the rise of the mark against the dollar, the German currency has also strengthened against the British pound, pushing the British currency to the bottom of its trading range in the European Monetary System.
If the pound falls much farther, the British Government will probably have to raise interest rates to defend it and keep it within its trading band. Such a move is likely to stun an economy that is having even more trouble generating growth than the American economy.
French bonds were off about three-quarters of a point as some investors sold to invest in Germany, where the dollar's decline is having a muted impact. German long bonds were up about a quarter of a point, in part because of the shift from other European markets, traders said.
 
Fed Unlikely to Cut Rates
 The fall of the dollar has managed to hurt American Treasury securities from the short end to the long end. Traders said that the dollar's decline seems to diminish the likelihood that the Federal Reserve can ease in the near future because another cut in interest rates would weaken the dollar.
"The dollar really lessens any possibility of an ease soon," said Eric Rosenfeld, co-head for fixed-income securities at Salomon Brothers. "It put us back in the 50-50 mode."
In one reflection of this concern, the average discount rate on three-month Treasury bills auctioned yesterday jumped 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, more than last week's auction, to 3.14 percent. On the six-month bill, the discount rate was up 6 basis points, to 3.24 percent.
At the same time, the uncertainty about the dollar makes investors much less willing to hold long-term securities, which are more volatile and subject to greater losses if a sudden dollar collapse precipitated even sharper drops in the bond market.
In late trading in the secondary market yesterday, the 7.25 percent 30-year bond was offered at 9722/32 , off 13/32 points, to yield 7.44 percent, compared with 7.35 percent on Friday. The 6.375 percent 10-year bond was off 17/32 points, to yield 6.68 percent, compared with 6.51 percent on Friday. In preauction or when-issued trading, the new five-year note had a yield of 5.73 percent, up from 5.53 percent at the end of last week. The new two-year note had a yield of 4.29 percent, compared with 4.12 percent Friday.
In the two trading days since the dollar broke to its lowest level in history against the German mark, the price of the long bond has dropped 1 1/2 points. This caused the yield on the bond to jump 12 basis points.
Before the dollar interruption, the yield on the long bond this month first fell to its lowest level since January and then to its lowest level since January 1987.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of three- and six-month bills yesterday:

HEADLINE: Cook Denies He Killed Athlete on Beach

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., Aug. 24

 BODY:
An unemployed cook was arraigned today in the slaying of Wayne Belliveau, a 23-year-old weightlifter and college football player who was shot during a melee at a beach in Rocky Point on July 5.
The suspect, Maximo Suriel, 27, of Coram, pleaded not guilty in Suffolk County Court. He was arrested early Sunday after a friend of Mr. Belliveau's, Scott Marchese, spotted him at a Port Jefferson bar and called the police. 
 The arrest followed a determined effort by family and friends to track down the killer of Mr. Belliveau, a 310-pound athlete from Rocky Point who died only days before he was to report for football practice at North Carolina State.
Posters in local store windows and on telephone poles offered $25,000 in reward money raised by local businesses and private donors for information leading to a conviction. Mr. Belliveau's parents, Ronald and Catherine, spoke at local gatherings to press the hunt, while word that the assailant's first name might be Max circulated through this North Shore hamlet of 8,700 people.
 
Picked Out in Lineup
 Lieut. John Gierasch, commanding officer of the Suffolk police homicide squad, said several witnesses to the shooting had picked out Mr. Suriel in a police lineup after his arrest.
The police said Mr. Marchese was at another bar around 3 A.M. on Sunday when an unidentified person came to summon him to Harborgates in Port Jefferson, where the person said someone fitting the killer's description was a customer.
The lieutenant said the circumstances of the shooting remained unclear. According to the police account, Mr. Belliveau, Mr. Marchese and a friend, Kerri Miller, 19, of Sound Beach, got into an argument with a group of people at the beach shortly before 2 A.M. The police said a fistfight broke out moments before someone, whom they now believe was Mr. Suriel, shot Mr. Belliveau and wounded both his companions.
Judge Rockwell Colaneri of Suffolk County District Court ordered Mr. Suriel held without bail.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 26, 1992, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article and headline yesterday about the killing of a college athlete on Long Island misstated details of a court appearance by a man who is accused of the killing. The suspect, Maximo Suriel, did not enter a plea at his arraignment on a charge of second-degree murder.

HEADLINE: Lawmaker's Defense of B.C.C.I. Went Beyond Speech in Senate

BYLINE: By DEAN BAQUET with JEFF GERTH

 BODY:
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the powerful Republican from Utah who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, worked behind the scenes on behalf of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International while at the same time pressing the bank to make a $10 million loan to a close business associate.
From documents and interviews with bank lawyers, a picture emerges of Mr. Hatch and an aide as integral parts of the bank's efforts to escape Senate scrutiny and avoid bad publicity after the bank pleaded guilty in 1989 to Federal charges of illegal laundering of drug money. 
 Mr. Hatch gave a widely reported speech on the Senate floor in 1990 defending B.C.C.I. and he later publicly acknowledged asking the bank to lend money to Monzer Hourani, a Houston businessman. But an examination of the bank documents and the interviews with lawyers and others found that the relationship went much deeper. These were among the findings:
*In late 1989, when a Senate subcommittee began a formal investigation of the bank's ties to dictators and terrorists, Michael Pillsbury, a longtime aide to Senator Hatch and an expert on national security, sat down with the bank's lawyers and offered advice on how to counterattack another Senator's inquiry, according to Mr. Pillsbury, as well as some of the bank's lawyers.
*After B.C.C.I. resolved the money-laundering case in Tampa, Fla., by reaching a plea agreement that many Government officials complained was far too lenient, Mr. Hatch talked to high-ranking Justice Department officials and urged them to step forward and defend the plea deal. A senior Justice Department official acknowledged the call. And a B.C.C.I. lawyer in Washington, Raymond Banoun, said he was present in Mr. Hatch's office when the Senator placed the call.
*The Senator said he made his Senate speech on behalf of B.C.C.I. after being assured by the bank's lawyers that the Florida money-laundering case involved only low-level corruption. Some of B.C.C.I.'s lawyers, including Mr. Banoun, said in interviews that they had talked with the Senator only reluctantly, fearing such a meeting would backfire and anger the Justice Department. The lawyers said they met with the Senator only because of pressure from Mohammad Hammoud, a close friend of Mr. Hatch and also a large B.C.C.I. shareholder. Mr. Hammoud died in 1990.
*Mr. Hatch earlier acknowledged news media reports that he telephoned B.C.C.I.'s president in London, Swaleh Navqi, to ask him to consider lending money to Mr. Hourani. He portrayed the efforts to get the loan as a casual request that produced no results. But a detailed loan proposal was made by Mr. Hourani, B.C.C.I. documents show. No loan apparently was made to Mr. Hourani, a close friend and campaign contributor to Mr. Hatch.
Mr. Hatch's motivation for helping the bank was not clear. But at least three of his friends stood to benefit if B.C.C.I. could remain a going concern in the United States: Mr. Hammoud, a large shareholder in B.C.C.I.; Robert Altman, one of the bank's chief lawyers, and Mr. Hourani, the business associate and campaign contributor who was trying to get a loan.
Mr. Hatch declined an invitation to discuss the details of a New York Times examination of the documents. In a recent statement responding to questions from The Times, Mr. Hatch said he would ask the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate the activities of Mr. Pillsbury, the aide who met with the B.C.C.I. lawyers.
Mr. Pillsbury, in an interview last week, said the discussions with the lawyers were held at the Senator's behest. Mr. Pillsbury, formerly a high-ranking State Department official, said he did not know of the Senator's attempts to secure a loan for Mr. Hourani. Mr. Pillsbury said he encouraged the Senator to request the ethics panel investigation "to show there were no improper contacts by me."
 
Senator Searching His Files for Details
 The Senator's staff said Mr. Hatch would make no additional comment because he was searching his files for more details of his dealings with B.C.C.I., Mr. Hourani and Mr. Hammoud. Last year the Senator produced a letter from the Justice Department stating that he was not under investigation for his relationship with B.C.C.I.
Mr. Hourani did not return repeated telephone messages left at his Houston residence.
B.C.C.I. was shut down last year after regulators around the world accused it of one of the biggest financial frauds in history. Since the shutdown, law-enforcement officials have accused the bank of bribing officials throughout the third world to attract government deposits to B.C.C.I.
Clark M. Clifford, a former Defense Secretary, and Mr. Altman, his law partner, have been charged with taking bribes from B.C.C.I. in exchange for concealing its ownership of First American Bankshares, a Washington holding company of which Mr. Clifford was the chairman. Both have denied the charges, which were filed in Federal and New York State courts.
 
The Regulatory Net Began to Tighten
 The examination by The Times shows that Mr. Hatch's dealings with B.C.C.I. in 1989 and 1990 coincided with the bank's efforts to use political influence around the world to stave off the law-enforcement officials and regulators who had begun to scrutinize its far-flung operations after years of regulatory neglect.
This push came after the bank's October 1988 indictment on money-laundering charges in Tampa. But even before the indictment, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations, led by Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, had begun its own inquiry.
By late 1989, the bank's lawyers were recommending that it plead guilty. But several of the lawyers said in interviews that B.C.C.I.'s top executives expressed dismay at the prospect of pleading guilty, at the soaring cost of the defense and at the negative publicity that would result from the plea and the Senate panel's hearings. The executives wondered whether some lobbying could be done to influence the committee investigation and the criminal case, according to the lawyers, who insisted on not being identified.
Another B.C.C.I. lawyer, Mr. Banoun in Washington, said the criticism "filtered back to us, that we were really dealing too much with it as a criminal case and not worrying about the Hill and the public relations issues."
Mr. Banoun said that around the same time, Mr. Naqvi, the president of B.C.C.I., called him to say that he had been visited in London by Mr. Pillsbury, who recommended that the lawyers meet with him and plan strategy for lobbying Congress. The lawyers said Mr. Naqvi told them that Mr. Pillsbury was accompanied by Mr. Hammoud, the B.C.C.I. shareholder and Mr. Hatch's friend. Mr. Naqvi quoted Mr. Hammoud as saying that Senator Hatch wanted to meet with B.C.C.I.'s lawyers.
 
Holding Meetings About Meetings
 "Hammoud was complaining to the bank," Mr. Banoun recalled. Quoting Mr. Hammoud, he said: " 'Here Senator Hatch wants to meet with those people, and the lawyers weren't setting up a meeting. Hatch wants to meet with you guys.' "
Mr. Banoun said he had told Mr. Naqvi by telephone that the Senate staff member's interest in a continuing investigation was so unusual that he feared it might be a Government "sting" operation. He warned the bank president to be certain not to pay Mr. Pillsbury any money or reimburse any of his expenses. He said he feared any payments might be construed as a bribe.
Shortly after the telephone call from London, Mr. Pillsbury showed up at the legal defense team's headquarters in Washington, along with Mr. Hammoud.
"He said he was inquiring on behalf of Hatch," Mr. Banoun recalled Mr. Pillsbury's saying at the time. By Mr. Banoun's account, Mr. Pillsbury said that he put notes of every meeting with the lawyers in writing and sent them to the Senator. Mr. Pillsbury confirmed that he passed on the notes.
Mr. Banoun said Mr. Pillsbury asked for Government tape recordings made by Customs agents in Tampa during the undercover operation. The lawyer said he stalled Mr. Pillsbury and never gave him the tapes. At the time, they had not been made public, he said.
 
'Couldn't Say No' To a Senate Aide
 "We didn't say no; he was a Senate staffer," Mr. Banoun recalled. "You just couldn't say no."
Mr. Banoun said he had given Mr. Pillsbury a copy of a defense motion accusing the Government of misconduct in the undercover operation.
"He thought it was a good motion," Mr. Banoun recalled, and he suggested that it should be circulated publicly.
Mr. Hatch has said he did not know that his friend Mr. Hammoud was a major B.C.C.I. shareholder. But Mr. Banoun said he thought Mr. Pillsbury, the Senator's aide, was aware of the connection.
Mr. Banoun said Mr. Pillsbury and Mr. Hammoud had arranged for the lawyers to meet the Senator at his office. By this time, Mr. Banoun said, the Government prosecutors and B.C.C.I.'s lawyers had reached a plea bargain over the money-laundering case. But the agreement was subject to approval by the judge in the case, and some members of Congress, led by Senator Kerry, were publicly attacking it.
Under the proposed plea bargain, B.C.C.I. was to pay $15 million in fines and admit that it had laundered money. For its part, the Government said it would not pursue various other accusations against B.C.C.I. But this generated controversy among Congressmen and law-enforcement officials who considered the bank to be guilty of much more than money laundering. Some Government officials even said the agreement was a result of the bank's political connections.
Mr. Banoun recalled that during this furor "Pillsbury said, 'Hatch wants to meet with you guys; he wants to know about the plea agreement, and wants to know why it's not being defended.' "
 
Defending Bank And Its Prosecutors
 Mr. Banoun said he had met with the Senator, who "was really annoyed, could not understand the department, why it was throwing in the towel." The "department" he referred to was the Justice Department.
During the meeting, Mr. Banoun said, Mr. Hatch placed a call to the Justice Department to complain, and pressed department officials to come to Congress to make their case in support of the plea bargain arrangement.
A department spokesman would not comment. But Robert S. Ross Jr., then executive assistant to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, said he spoke to the Senator around this time.
"He wanted a briefing," Mr. Ross said. "He wanted to know what was going on." Mr. Ross said he did not view the discussion as unusual, given Mr. Hatch's position on the Judiciary Committee.
"He wasn't being a lobbyist for any particular side," Mr. Ross said.
Mr. Banoun said he had at least one other meeting with Mr. Hatch, though he could not recall specifics.
The judge approved the plea agreement in January 1990, and the attacks in Congress continued.
The next month, Mr. Hatch took the Senate floor. In a speech largely written by Mr. Altman, one of B.C.C.I,'s own lawyers, Mr. Hatch defended the bank and the Justice Department. "The case arose from the conduct of a small number of B.C.C.I.'s more than 14,000 employees," Mr. Hatch said.
Two weeks later, by Mr. Hatch's account in an interview last November, the Senator telephoned the bank's president, Mr. Naqvi, and asked that he consider lending money to Mr. Hourani, the Senator's Houston business associate and friend.
 
Big Contributor Hurt By Houston Slump
 Mr. Hourani, portrayed by business associates and court documents as hard hit by the Houston recession of the late 1980's, was a big campaign contributor to Mr. Hatch. In 1987 and 1988, he and his employees gave a total of at least $12,000 to the Senator's campaign organizations.
In 1988, the Senator and the developer entered into an unusual investment. Mr. Hatch said Mr. Hourani had invested $10,000 of Mr. Hatch's money, using it to buy a one-bedroom apartment in a development in southwest Houston. The 600-square-foot apartment is on the first floor of a 20-year-old complex, across a highway from a pawnshop. It is appraised at about $20,000.
On April 2, 1990, less than a month after the phone call from Mr. Hatch to B.C.C.I.'s president, Mr. Hourani wrote a three-page letter to Mr. Naqvi, outlining a proposal for the bank to give him loan guarantees, in exchange for a percentage of whatever projects were financed.
It is not known what became of the proposal, though Mr. Hatch said Mr. Hourani had never received financing from B.C.C.I.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Bush's Gains From Convention Nearly Evaporate in Latest Poll

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
President Bush's gains from four days in the spotlight at the Republican National Convention have almost completely evaporated, as the President failed to convince the public that he is committed to change and to reviving the economy, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas re-established a strong lead, holding a 51 percent to 36 percent edge in the poll, which was taken Sunday and Monday. That is about the same margin he held before last week's convention. 
 The poll showed the public had far more interest in hearing about Mr. Clinton's favorite issues, the economy and health care, than in topics featured at the convention, like family values and homosexuality.
The survey of 903 registered voters also provided fresh evidence of the loose allegiances of voters this year, showing that large numbers of men, young people, the poor and the financially comfortable all shifted back and forth in the last two weeks.
 
Turnaround Among Men
 Men, for example, had supported President Bush by 47 percent to 40 percent in a Times/CBS News Poll taken last Thursday as the convention ended. By the time of this poll, they supported Mr. Clinton by 51 percent to 38 percent. Their shift accounted for most of the change between the two polls, as the earlier one favored Mr. Clinton, but only by 45 to 42 percent overall.
Robert M. Teeter, chairman of the President's re-election campaign and a leading Republican poll taker for a quarter century, said he thought the results were more favorable to Mr. Clinton than was actually true. He said the Bush campaign had done no fresh polling since the convention but added, "Usually you will not lose what you gained" from a convention.
"My view is the race is about 50 to 40," he said.
Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's poll taker, said his latest data did indicate a double-digit Clinton lead that "re-emerged immediately after Bush's speech." He said Mr. Bush had created high expectations for his acceptance speech but did not meet them.
Despite four days of continual attacks, Mr. Clinton emerged from this poll with 36 percent of the public viewing him favorably and 28 percent unfavorably. The negative rating was up from 24 percent before the convention, a shift within the poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, but down from 34 percent unfavorable recorded last Thursday.
Mr. Greenberg said Mr. Bush "appears to have grazed Clinton but done nothing for himself."
 
Three Failures Found
 After weeks of predictions that Mr. Bush would use his Thursday acceptance speech to re-establish his image with the public, the poll measured three striking failures.
First was the overall public answer to the question "Do you approve or disapprove of the way George Bush is handling his job as President?" While many questions were asked only of registered voters, that query was put to the 1,186 adults, registered or not, in the overall sample. Thirty-eight percent said they approved and 53 percent said they disapproved, exactly the same percentages that were recorded in a pre-convention Times/CBS News Poll. No incumbent has ever won a new term after having an approval rating that low this close to Election Day.
Martin Wattenberg, a professor of political science at the University of California at Irvine, called the approval rating "the most significant figure in the poll." If Republicans could not improve those figures at the convention and build broader support for Mr. Bush, he said, "They will have to run an incredibly negative campaign."
The poll also found that while 95 percent of registered voters said there should be "real change in the way things are going in this country," only 15 percent said Mr. Bush could bring it about. Indeed, only 34 percent of his own supporters said he could. Sixty-one percent of the public said Mr. Clinton would cause "real change."
The survey also showed that only 24 percent said Mr. Bush "has offered specific ideas to get the United States out of the recession." That was up only one percentage point from the pre-convention poll. Forty-nine percent said Mr. Clinton had offered specific ideas, up from 48 percent.
The poll did not ask any questions directly about the convention in Houston, but it sought to find what subjects the public wanted the candidates to spend a lot of time discussing. Nine Americans in 10, regardless of whom they favored, wanted substantial discussion of how the candidates planned to improve the nation's economy and how they would improve the country's health care system, subjects Mr. Clinton discusses in almost every speech.
Two subjects that were frequently raised at the Republican convention, "family values" and "legal rights for homosexuals," excited less interest. Only 23 percent wanted to hear about homosexuals' rights. Forty-nine percent of registered voters, including 63 percent of Bush supporters and 40 percent of Clinton supporters, wanted to hear candidates "discussing how they would uphold traditional family values."
One hopeful Republican interpretation of the survey came from Linda DiVall, a poll taker who said that Republican gains shown in the poll in the South and Midwest and among Roman Catholics were encouraging. Even fluctuations among young voters and men, she said, showed that the Bush campaign had an opportunity to win them. She said this race was distinguished by low intensity and low levels of support for both candidates, and by frequent shifts in support.
Mr. Clinton, for example, went from a 43-to-43 percent tie with Mr. Bush before the Democratic convention in New York to a 55-to-31 percent lead immediately after, a lead that decreased a little to 52 to 35 percent just before the Republican convention in Houston.
Mr. Greenberg disagreed with her, saying, "This is the last time George Bush will have the stage to himself" to make his case. Another Democratic poll taker, Peter D. Hart, compared Mr. Bush to a slumping baseball player batting against second division pitching and still not hitting: "It was his convention, his terms, and his own pitching machine, and his average stayed the same."
 
Clinton Slows in South
 In the South, the 49-to-38 percent lead Mr. Clinton held before the Republican convention was reduced, in the latest poll, to a 46-to-41 percent lead. Among Midwesterners, his lead dropped from a 54-to-31 edge to a 52-to-38 percent lead. And among Roman Catholics, a 57-to-31 percent lead narrowed to a 51-to-38 percent edge.
Nationally, when undecided respondents were asked if they leaned toward either candidate, more said they preferred Mr. Clinton; his lead widened slightly to 55 percent to 39 percent.
Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Teeter both suggested that the poll taken last Thursday may have exaggerated Mr. Bush's temporary gains from the convention by a couple of percentage points.
But it was clear to them and to others that there have been major fluctuations among men in this series of polls while women's support for Mr. Clinton remained more constant.
Barbara A. Bardes, a professor of political science at Loyola University of Chicago, said she believed "men just haven't decided which issues are most important to them in this election." Women, she said, have at least temporarily settled on the importance of the question of freedom of choice concerning abortion and are widely unhappy with attacks on Hillary Clinton, whether they like her or not.
Ann F. Lewis, a Democratic consultant in Boston, said, "It really does seem these days that men are much more responsive to politics of emotion, especially certain kinds of patriotic symbolism, while women are more likely to focus on the family budget and the nation's well-being."
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sunday and Monday with 1,186 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, of whom 903 said they were registered voters.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened so that calls would be placed to residences only. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all registered voters in the country.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For results based on men, for example, it is plus or minus five percentage points, while for women it is four percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for example, can lead to somewhat varying results.

HEADLINE: Home Resales Up 3.9% in July

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes rose 3.9 percent in July from the previous month, signaling a modest recovery in the sluggish housing market, a real estate group said today.
The National Association of Realtors said sales had increased to an annual rate of 3.48 million units, seasonally adjusted, from 3.35 million in June. The organization said the rise was largely spurred by the lowest mortgage rates in 19 years. 
 July sales were up 6.7 percent from July 1991, the real estate group said. Prices for existing homes fell 2.4 percent, to a median price of $102,600 in July, and were down 7.8 percent from $103,400 last year.
Sales in the Midwest surged 12.8 percent from a month earlier and almost 20 percent from last year. Sales also rose in the South, up eight-tenths of a percent from June and 5 percent from last year.
But sales were unchanged from the previous month in the Northeast and West, though Northeast sales were 5.9 percent higher compared with a year ago. Sales in the West, however, were off by 4 percent from July 1991.
While the improvement in the sales of existing homes was good news for the housing business and should help new-home construction, economists did not view it as an indicator of greater consumer confidence or a strong, widespread recovery.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Slight Gain Managed By Dollar

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
After falling sharply against the German mark in the last week, the dollar stabilized in volatile trading yesterday, but many traders predicted that it would soon drift lower.
Foreign exchange traders said some people were selling marks to take profits now that the dollar has plunged some 17 percent against the mark in four months. 
 In New York, the dollar closed at 1.4027 German marks, up slightly from its all-time low of 1.4015 on Monday.
"The dollar has absorbed a lot of selling, falling some 4 or 5 percent in the past three days," said Jay Tucker, manager of the foreign exchange department at the First Boston Corporation. "The dollar needs to consolidate a little before it moves again. But the potential for the dollar to weaken is still there."
 
Central Banks Step Back
 Currency traders said the Federal Reserve and other central banks, which intervened heavily to defend the dollar on Friday and Monday, refrained from intervening yesterday, because they saw that the exchange markets were remaining orderly and that the dollar was not plunging.
In morning trading, the dollar sank to a new low of 1.3945 marks, before bouncing upward in the afternoon.
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange followed the dollar, ending up for the day after heading downward in the morning. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,232.22, up 4.05 points.
Traders said the dollar was hurt in the morning by a Conference Board report showing that consumer confidence had fallen in August to its lowest level since March.
 
Some Signs of Strength
 The bad news on consumer confidence was offset somewhat by reports showing that sales of existing homes rose 3.9 percent in July and that sales of domestically made cars and light trucks rose 10.2 percent in the 10-day period ended Aug. 20.
Economists say the main reasons for the dollar's slide are the stubborn weakness of the American economy and the differential between Germany's high short-term interest rates and America's low rates. The high German rates are spurring many investors to buy marks to invest in lucrative German bonds, while America's poor economic performance is discouraging many foreign investors from buying dollars to invest in American stocks.
"The currency market has not shaken off the image of malaise about the U.S. economy," said Curtis Perkins, a currency trader with Chemical Bank. He forecast that the dollar would soon fall to about 1.38 marks.
Another factor pushing down the dollar yesterday morning was news that a poll found that a majority of French voters planned to oppose a plan calling for countries in the European Community to adopt a single currency and bind their economies closer together. A referendum is set for a Sept. 20. The poll caused many traders to buy the mark because France's rejection of the plan would be expected to lead to a realignment that devalues many European currencies against the mark.
Later in the day, however, news of another French poll was released showing that the French, by a narrow majority, still favored the Maastricht Treaty, which calls for setting up a single European currency no later than 1999.
 
No Alarm in Washington
 Although officials in Europe say the dollar's lows indicate a lack of confidence in the American economy, officials in Washington did not express alarm about the dollar's decline.
The weaker dollar is expected to help bolster American exports, which the Bush Administration says is vital for future economic growth. But at the same time, a weaker dollar could ultimately help spur inflation by making imports more expensive.
This morning, Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of Germany's central bank, sought to push up the dollar, saying that the selling of the American currency was overdone.
Currency traders say the intervention of the central banks was aimed not so much to reverse the dollar's decline, as to make sure the dollar did not enter into a free fall.

HEADLINE: When Voters Take a Holiday

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DUTTON, Ala., Aug. 25

 BODY:
It was Election Day in Dutton today, and no one voted.
But everybody had a good excuse: No one was running for Mayor or for any of the five seats on the Town Council, the only positions at stake. 
 As a result, this northeastern Alabama town of 243 people will end up with no elected officials when the terms of the Mayor and the four remaining Council members expire in October. A fifth Council post has been vacant for more than a year, ever since its occupant moved away. None of the offices carry a salary.
Perry Roquemore, executive director of the Alabama League of Municipalities, said his office was prepared to ask Gov. Guy Hunt to appoint four new Council members so the town can continue to do business.
"I don't know that there's any reason why no one is running," said Mayor Larry Stockman. "There's no financial crisis. I really don't think it's news, either."

HEADLINE: Stocks Level After Dollar Calms Down

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Calm returned to Wall Street yesterday after two straight days of losses as a steadier dollar enabled blue-chip stocks to close slightly higher.
 But buyers were still in short supply, a fact borne out by losses in many smaller stocks. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.05 points to close at 3,232.22. Declining issues led those that gained, 1,002 to 719, on the New York Stock Exchange as volume swelled to 202.8 million shares, from 165.7 million on Monday.
 The dollar hit an all-time low of 1.3945 German marks in early trading after a French opinion poll showed a majority against Europe's Maastricht Treaty on economic and monetary union.
 But the United States currency bounced back to end the session at 1.4027 marks, compared with 1.4015 marks on Monday.
 The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 10/32 , or $3.44 for every $1,000 face amount. It yielded 7.47 percent compared with 7.45 percent late Monday.
 There were several French polls on the Maastricht Treaty on European unity. While the first showed 51 percent opposed to the treaty, a second survey showed 51 percent in favor.
 
After the Survey
 The first survey started a sharp selloff in the dollar, which quickly spread to the stock market, where the Dow lost as much as 21 points.
 Jack Solomon, a technical analyst at Bear, Stearns, said stock prices could be poised to go higher. "The fluctuations seem to be tamping down," he said about the currency markets.
 A rise in I.B.M., which added 2, to 87 1/8, helped strengthen the Dow.
 Several analysts said I.B.M.'s gain could reflect assumptions that multinational companies will benefit from the dollar's weakness.
 "You're going to get some very strong effects for companies that do a lot of business overseas," said Ron Hill, a strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman.
 "The market is trying to right itself," said Ed Laux, a senior vice president of Kidder, Peabody. He added that the rise in the Dow "is probably an encouraging sign."
 But analysts noted that much of the economic news remained tepid. The consumer confidence index for August fell to 58.0 from 61.2 in July.
 
Gains Seen for Drugs
 Several analysts said drug companies should benefit from the dollar's weakness because many have significant overseas operations. Merck rose 5/8, to 51; Pfizer added 1/2, to 80 1/2, and Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 1 1/2, to 67 1/4.
 Picturetel slumped 4 1/4, to 11 1/4, after saying it expected to break even in the third quarter on revenues that are flat or slightly lower than the second quarter. Hambrecht & Quist and Alex. Brown cut ratings.
 Ford Motor gained 1 3/8, to 40 1/8. It said domestic car sales from Aug. 11 to 20 rose 13.7 percent.
 The hurricane took its toll on Seibels Bruce, which slipped 2 5/8, to 3. Lincoln National's American States said it had canceled a planned merger with the insurance concern because of losses caused by the hurricane.
 Grand Metropolitan fell 2 1/2, to 30, after it issued a profit warning. Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating.
 The Nasdaq market index lost 1.17, to close at 554.22.
 The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 0.89, to 411.61. The American Stock Exchange index fell 1.38 points, to 379.52. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.13, to 226.47. The Wilshire Associates Equity Index was 3,952.592, down 2.1 points, or 0.05 percent.

Deere Profit Falls 70.9%; Sales Weak

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Deere & Company said yesterday that its net income fell 70.9 percent, to $9.1 million, or 12 cents a share, in the third quarter.
Sales were down slightly, to $1.75 billion, as the nation's largest maker of farm equipment was buffeted by soft market conditions worldwide for its products. 
 In the comparable 1991 quarter, the company earned $31.3 million, or 31 cents a share, on sales of $1.79 billion.
 
Weakness Was Widespread
 In the latest quarter, which ended on July 31, the demand for lawn and garden equipment was weaker than expected, Deere said. Demand was also sluggish for industrial and agricultural equipment in the United States and foreign markets. "That doesn't leave much," said John J. Mackin, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company.
Higher prices for many Deere products helped offset some of the declines, but the company said competitive pressures forced it to offer incentives that hurt profit levels.
The quarterly results were generally within analysts' estimates. Deere had said in late July that its equipment division would lose money this year and that it planned to cut production sharply in the fourth quarter.
The company's stock closed yesterday at $38.50 a share, down 87.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company expressed little optimism about the outlook for the economy. "Consumer confidence remains at a low level and the pattern of slow, uneven growth in the domestic economy is expected to continue," said Hans W. Becherer, chairman and chief executive of Deere, which is based in Moline, Ill. "The extent of recovery in housing starts and consumer spending for durable goods will be key determinants of the level of future demand for our construction and lawn- and grounds-care equipment.
"In North America, farmers continue to be cautious buyers, and overseas agricultural equipment demand is expected to remain soft," he added. "Accordingly, our outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year and into early 1993 remains uncertain."
In reaction to the slowed demand, the company has cut production, and plans to continue doing so.

Matsushita's Net Drops 76%; JVC Will Pare 700 Workers

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 25

 BODY:
The Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, one of the world's largest makers of consumer electronics, said today that its net income plunged 76 percent in the April-June quarter.
Meanwhile, the Victor Company of Japan, which markets consumer electronics under the JVC label, said it planned to trim 700 people at its video plants over a year through attrition and a hiring freeze on new high school graduates. 
 Matsushita and JVC cut their earnings forecasts for the coming months. Instead of a small profit, JVC now expects a $208 million loss.
Japan's electronics industry has been hit particularly hard by the sharp economic slowdown in Japan and stagnation overseas.
Sales have also been slow because many of the industry's main products -- stereos, TV's and videocassette recorders -- are mature goods for which technological change is slow and ownership already widespread.
Matsushita posted earnings of 9 billion yen, or $72 million, for its first fiscal quarter, compared with 38.2 billion yen a year earlier."Severe external conditions, most notably decreased demand for video and audio equipment," cut the quarter's sales 3 percent, to 1.71 trillion yen, or $13.7 billion, from 1.77 trillion yen.
The company said Japan's economic slowdown and weak demand in Europe and the United States had hit sales particularly hard. Sales of video equipment fell 11 percent, while audio equipment dropped 5 percent.
Sales in Matsushita's entertainment divisions, consisting mostly of MCA Inc., the American conglomerate that it acquired in December 1990, fell 1 percent.
Matsushita also said it was lowering its earnings forecast for the parent company for the first half of the fiscal year, which began in April. It said net income would plunge 53 percent, to 29 billion yen, or $232 million, compared with its earlier forecast of a 26 percent decline.
 
JVC Sees Deficit
 JVC, a leading maker of videocassette recorders, said it expected to lose 26 billion yen, or $208 million, for the fiscal year.
JVC, which does not report quarterly results, had said it expected a profit of only 1 billion yen, or $8 million, because of the weak market for audio-visual products.

Despite Woes in Real Estate, Wells Fargo Rebuilds Profits

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Wells Fargo & Company, one of the nation's most successful banking companies in the late 1980's, has hit a rocky patch.
Problems with bad real estate loans wiped out all but $21 million of its 1991 earnings, and earnings of $201 million in the first half of this year were below par by Wells Fargo's standards. At midyear, Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, held $13.6 billion of commercial real estate loans -- the most of any bank in the country -- with about 11.5 percent badly delinquent or so troubled that full repayment is not expected. 
 Nevertheless, the company has the endorsement of investors like Warren E. Buffett, who has bought about 10.8 percent of the company since May 1991, and Walter H. Annenberg, who announced earlier this month that he had bought 5.3 percent of Wells Fargo's stock. Why?
One reason is that unlike the situation at many other banks, which have weak profits in other parts of their business as well as real estate problems, Wells Fargo's trouble's with real estate loans have highlighted its strength in other facets of banking. Another is that the 1986 acquisition of Crocker National by Wells Fargo was a model for other bankers who are seeking to improve profits by merging with a competitor and eliminating duplication in offices, computer systems and employees.
Today, Wells Fargo is making new efforts to squeeze even greater profit from its consumer business. After educating consumers in the 1980's about the benefits of telephone banking and automatic teller machines, Wells recently raised its prices for those services for certain customers.
"A lot of other banks are chafing to start charging for services they have been giving away," said Les Dinkin, managing director at NBI, a bank consulting firm in New York. "It's a way to rebuild earnings and capital," he said, adding that higher fees help profits and build relationships if customers are persuaded to increase their deposits so that fees do not apply.
On July 1, Wells Fargo imposed new charges on telephone banking -- a 24-hour phone line available to check balances, transfer funds between accounts and answer other inquiries. All customers are allowed three free calls a month. For additional calls, customers who lack the minimum average checking balance of $750 or the combined balance in all accounts of $2,500, Wells charges 50 cents a call to a computerized voice and $1.50 to human operators.
According to a recent report by Salomon Brothers, which Wells Fargo officials declined to confirm, about 90 percent of the bank's customers used the telephone service fewer than three times a month, but 10 percent (with average balances of only $200) used the service 12 to 14 times a month, often to see if a check had cleared.
Wells Fargo has also started charging a $1 monthly fee for customers who use their plastic bank cards -- the same one used for automatic teller machines -- for purchases, mostly groceries and gasoline. Such card use is widespread in California and is growing rapidly elsewhere.
To further reduce costs, on May 1 Wells Fargo stopped returning canceled checks to customers who signed up for lower-cost checking accounts in which all deposits and withdrawals are made at automatic teller machines. Customers who need the checks for tax records, may obtain up to 12 a year at no charge, but they pay fees for additional requests. The program, called check truncation, has been used by a handful of banks, including the Bank of America, for several years, and is spreading to others.
The new consumer charges are part of a long-term effort that made Wells Fargo one of the top banks in the country in terms of cost control in recent years. In 1991, its efficiency ratio, or operating expenses divided by revenues, was 58.8 percent, the fifth best among large banks, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a securities firm. The BankAmerica Corporation has been improving but was still 12th in the Keefe Bruyette ranking, at 61.6 percent.
Despite Wells Fargo's efficiency, the bank's efforts to charge consumers for the services are not likely to generate enough money to make investors and analysts forget the company's problems with commercial real estate.
John Leonard, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, estimated the new fees could increase Wells Fargo's revenues by $10 million a quarter, and nearly all of that would be profit. Still, it would make only a dent in the losses from writing off bad loans and replenishing the reserve for loan losses.
Since Wells announced a $132 million increase in foreclosed real estate, to $555 million, at midyear and a $250 million-plus increase in nonperforming loans, to $2.33 billion, analysts see little decline in loan write-offs or the provision to loan-loss reserves for a few more quarters.
But because other parts of Wells Fargo's business are in such good state, Mr. Leonard estimates that a stabilization of problems with bad loans would allow profits to improve. By 1993, the company could be earning $12 a share, up sharply from 16 cents a share in 1991, he projects, and even surpassing the record $11.16 a share earned in 1990 after excluding one-time benefits.
But not everyone is sanguine. George Salem of Prudential Securities, for example, fears that problems with California's real estate markets and the economy will keep loan problems high and retard the bank's recovery.

HEADLINE: Oil Industry Is Battened Down

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Aug. 25

 BODY:
The oil industry braced for Hurricane Andrew today, completing evacuations of thousands of workers from the 3,700 drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and scaling back or shutting down operations at dozens of gasoline refineries in Texas and Louisiana.
In financial markets, there was little worry that Hurricane Andrew would disrupt the nation's gasoline supplies. After rising more than 2 cents in trading on Monday, unleaded gasoline for September delivery fell 0.60 cent today, to 62.13 cents a gallon. 
 Paul D. Mlotok, an oil analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, said that past hurricanes had brought brief disruptions, at worst, to refineries along the Gulf Coast.
 
Modern Designs
 Many modern refineries are designed to withstand winds of up to 200 miles an hour, with drainage systems to cope with water surges that can leave water at depths of six feet or more on refinery grounds.
But no one predicted that refiners would escape the storm unscathed. When Hurricane Alicia struck on Aug. 18, 1983, near Galveston, Tex., about 100 miles west of Hurricane Andrew's likely landfall, gasoline production at Gulf Coast refineries dropped. Output was down by 500,000 barrels a day -- a little less than 10 percent -- for a week after that storm, said Peter C. Beutel, energy director at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
The Shell Oil Company, the largest producer of oil and gas from platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, said 850 of its 900 employees and contract workers had been ferried to coastal loading zones since preparations for the hurricane began early Monday.
Shell Oil operates in 57 separate production fields in gulf waters, and has shut virtually all of its daily crude output of 145,000 barrels a day and 490 million cubic feet of gas output, or half of its normal daily volume. Many gas-drilling platforms in the western gulf region continue to operate, said Holly R. Hutchins, a Shell spokesman in Houston.
At Cameron, La., about 40 miles east of Port Arthur, Tex., dozens of large refineries were preparing for the storm, including ones operated by Fina, Chevron and Star Enterprises, a joint venture of Saudi Aramco and Texaco.
The companies said today that they had suspended operations. Rick Hagar, a spokesman for Fina, based in Dallas, said the company decided to shut its Port Arthur refinery, which consumes 150,000 barrels of crude daily, at 4 P.M., Eastern daylight time. Most of its 450 workers were sent home. An emergency crew of 30 people planned to spend the night in the refinery's control room, which has walls designed to withstand major explosions.
Production at the Citgo Petroleum Corporation's large refinery in Lake Charles, La., 50 miles east of Port Arthur, was also halted late today. The refinery, which supplies much of daily gasoline shipments to Citgo stations east of the Rockies, has a capacity of 320,000 barrels a day of crude. Including a nearby plant that produces lubricants, Citgo has 1,500 employees at the site.
Coast Guard officials said they could not estimate the number of workers taken ashore by boat or helicopter from offshore platforms since early Monday, but the number probably exceeded 10,000.
Commercial traffic along the lower Mississippi River was halted at New Orleans, where more than 20,000 people working along docks and at warehouses that generate sales of $10 million daily at the Port Authority of New Orleans were sent home for the day.
Dozens of vessels, including many that serve offshore drilling platforms, were moored along the deep-water harbor that runs from the mouth of the Mississippi River toward Baton Rouge, La., about 180 miles upstream.
"Right now, we think we're going to be along the eastern edge of the storm, and we should be O.K.," said J. Ron Brinson, the port authority's president and chief executive.

HEADLINE: BEIJING SENTENCES, THEN RELEASES FOE

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 25

 BODY:
In what appears to be the last political trial related to the Tiananmen Square democracy movement, China sentenced an influential economist today to three years in prison for counterrevolutionary crimes and then released him for time served.
Wu Jiaxiang, a 37-year-old theorist who was detained on July 17, 1989, was allowed to return home this afternoon after his sentence was read out to a courtroom, a family member said. Mr. Wu was jailed for five weeks more than his official jail term, and one of the reasons appears to be that officials wanted to end the three-year series of Tiananmen political trials by allowing the last person tried to walk away from his sentencing a free man. 
 "This is the last trial," said John T. Kamm, an American businessman and human-rights campaigner who met this week with justice and police officials. "They wanted to close it with a release."
Officials told Mr. Kamm that all Chinese who were detained in connection with the Tiananmen Square democracy movement have now been tried and that a handful of other Chinese prisoners also have been released recently. But they evaded questions about what would happen if Chinese dissidents still wanted by the Government returned to China.
 
'Brain Trust' Member
 Mr. Wu was a senior researcher at the Communist Party Central Committee General Office and was held in Qincheng Prison, where he was allowed to read but not write.
He was charged with counterrevolutionary incitement and propaganda. Mr. Wu did not actively take part in the protests, although he is believed to have been accused of writing a set of counterrevolutionary" slogans that were used in Tiananmen Square demonstrations.
A native of a remote village in Anhui Province, Mr. Wu grew up in the countryside. After the Cultural Revolution, he attended Beijing University and his career soared.
In the late 1980's, Mr. Wu became a member of the "brain trust" of young intellectuals surrounding the Communist Party leader, Zhao Ziyang. Mr. Wu wrote several important policy speeches and a book on the theory of Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader. He was close to Gen. Wang Ruilin, Mr. Deng's chief of staff.
 
Reports of Breakdowns
 But those contacts did not help him after his arrest.
"He's one of them," said a Chinese journalist. "And they think he betrayed them."
There have been reports that Mr. Wu also suffered from mental breakdowns, and the family member reached today suggested that Mr. Wu would need some rest to recuperate mentally from his ordeal.
"On the outside, he looked okay," said the family member, adding that he did not have a chance to speak much with Mr. Wu.
 
Steel Worker Reported Freed
 A poet and prominent essayist, Mr. Wu was one of the original proponents of "new authoritarianism." That theory held that Chinese required enlightened despotism, rather than Western-style democracy, to promote the growth of a healthy economic system and prepare for broader freedoms later on.
Mr. Wu was a close associate of Bao Tong, the former political secretary of the Politburo, who was sentenced last month to seven years in prison.
The Government also told Mr. Kamm that it had released Zhu Jianbin, a 37-year-old dissident who had been imprisoned for 11 years because of his involvement in the Democracy Spring movement that began in 1978. Mr. Zhu, a steel worker who edited a pro-democracy journal, The Bell Tolls, was detained in 1981 and virtually nothing has been heard of him since then.
Officials told Mr. Kamm that Mr. Zhu was tried and sentenced in April 1981 to six years in prison for counterrevolutionary incitement. They said he broke prison regulations when he assaulted someone in a brawl and then had his sentenced increased by "several years."
 
Prisoner's Wife Released
 The authorities would not say when Mr. Zhu was released. They told Mr. Kamm that Mr. Zhu has returned to his home in Wuhan and now has a job.
Another dissident, Hou Xiaotian, said today that she had been released after four days of questioning about her plans to protest on behalf of her imprisoned husband. Ms. Hou said she was released late Sunday night but had been kept in a guest house rather than a prison and had been well treated.
Her husband, Wang Juntao, is serving a 13-year sentence for his role in the Tiananmen democracy movement. He began a hunger strike on Aug. 11 to protest actions by authorities to block two suits he is filing against the court and a prison.
Ms. Hou said the authorities told her that her husband had lost about 22 pounds since he began his hunger strike, but that he was eating again on an irregular basis.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Signs Farm-Protection Bill Into Law

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: GENEVA, N.Y., Aug. 25

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signed a farm-protection bill into law today, and the New York Farm Bureau called it the most significant new farm legislation in a decade.
The bill limits the right of local governments to ban normal farm practices, protects farmers against nuisance lawsuits, classifies farmland and farm buildings in a lower tax class and creates farmland protection boards in each county. 
 It also requires that people buying land in farm areas be told about local farming practices that may cause noise, dust and smells.
"New York's agricultural industry is an invaluable asset to our state's economy and quality of life," Governor Cuomo said at a ceremony at the state's Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, about 50 miles southwest of Syracuse.
The bill, which the Legislature passed in July, gives the state Department of Agriculture and Markets the authority to decide whether farming activities -- such as using agricultural chemicals, running grain-dryer fans or operating a combine at night -- are justified.
The law also requires that the department be involved when a public project, such as a road, is proposed for agricultural land.
"This is the biggest piece of legislation for agriculture in the last 10 years," said Mark Emery, a spokesman for the state Farm Bureau.
There are about 38,000 farmers in New York State, down about 4,000 from 1982.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Criticizes Clinton as Hard On Car Industry

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CANTON, Mich., Aug. 25

 BODY:
President Bush ventured into the backyard of the American automobile industry today to depict his Democratic rivals as environmental extremists whose policies would throw hundreds of thousands of Michigan residents out of work.
Under rain clouds at an outdoor rally in this township that is home to both laid off General Motors workers and affluent executives, Mr. Bush strongly criticized Gov. Bill Clinton's support of a proposal to raise automobile fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon by the turn of the century from the current 27.5. He also contended that the Governor had started with a bad environmental record in Arkansas and then moved too far in the other direction. 
 "He's gone all the way over from that lousy record now to becoming bright green," Mr. Bush told thousands of cheering supporters at the Canton Township Heritage Park west of Detroit. "He's turned that bright, and if Clinton has his way, Michigan auto workers are going to be turning green with illness."
Citing figures from a motor vehicle industry group, Mr. Bush said that in Michigan alone, "40,000 workers would go from the assembly line to the unemployment line if we go from those ridiculous standards."
 
Going After Gore Book
 Acknowledging that he does not usually single out Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, Mr. Clinton's running mate, Mr. Bush said he could not help himself today. While Mr. Clinton has praised Mr. Gore's best selling book, "Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit," Mr. Bush recited passages from it that he said were distressing.
Ridiculing "this famous book now that Governor Clinton talks about," the President went on: "On page 325 of the book, he makes an interesting comparison. He says that the automobile industry -- and I quote right here, quotation, 'poses a mortal threat to the security of every nation, that is more deadly than that of any military enemy we're ever again likely to confront.' That is Mr. Clinton's running mate talking about the auto industry that means so much to our country."
Still mocking Mr. Gore's book, Mr. Bush then said: "And one page later, he calls for the 'elimination of the internal combustion engine.' What kind of people are we dealing with here?"
In a telephone interview from Ohio, where he was campaigning, Mr. Gore chuckled when told that the President was reciting from his book.
"This is simply one more effort by the self-proclaimed environmental President to divert attention from his total economic and environmental failure," he said. "What the auto industry needs is not political posturing but a strong economy and money in the pockets of consumers who can then purchase new cars and trucks."
Mr. Gore also disputed Mr. Bush's figures about jobs that would be lost under the Democrats' proposals, saying there have been 250,000 jobs lost under the stewardship of the Bush Administration, with another 600,000 lost in related industries.
In another effort to portray the Democratic ticket as extremist, the President alluded to the bus trips Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have taken around the country. "So when that Clinton-Gore bus goes off the left side of the highway onto the shoulder," he said, "we've got to guard against that, too."
With Bush campaign aides describing Michigan as a crucial battleground in November, Mr. Bush found a receptive site for his warnings about tighter fuel standards. The Congressional district that includes Canton has 25 plants of the Big Three auto manufacturers, and Michigan has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, 9.4 percent in July.
Mr. Bush flew into the nearby Willow Run Airport in Ypsilanti, and his motorcade rushed by a sprawling plant that General Motors recently announced it would shut down, possibly next summer, leaving an estimated 4,000 workers without jobs.
The President came to Michigan for his offensive on the environment after what he billed as a nonpolitical stop in Chicago this morning at a convention of the American Legion.
At that appearance, his aides passed out literature critical of Mr. Clinton's record regarding the Vietnam-era draft, while Mr. Bush stayed above the fray.
In a break from his pattern since the Republican Convention last week, in which he has attacked members of Congress at virtually every stop, the President praised a Democratic Congressman, Representative G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery, a friend of his who has long been close to veterans.
But he was not kind to Democrats here. As supporters wielded brooms with signs reading "Clean the House!" and opponents waved pink slips, Mr. Bush took on the Congressman here, Representative William D. Ford, chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, for opposing his education proposals.
"I'm a little tired of Congressmen that talk one way in Michigan and vote different in Washington," the President said, his voice rising in anger. "I'll give you an example. One of those Democratic leaders that blocked this new proposal in education is named Congressman Ford, Bill Ford. He has stood against school choice and just about every education reform I have put forward. And what's worse, Governor of Arkansas agrees with him."
Turning to international affairs, Mr. Bush pressed on: "You want to stand up to a Baghdad Bully like Saddam Hussein? Governor Clinton waffled. Congressman Ford said, 'no way.' I say 'yes.' "
In another attack on the Democrats, Mary Matalin, the deputy campaign manager, distributed to reporters a four-page "counter-rebuttal on Clinton's tax-and-fee record." The paper was a defense of criticism of the Bush campaign's list of 128 purported state tax increases under Governor Clinton. It said, among other things, that it was "grossly dishonest" for the Governor to call Arkansas a low-tax state.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Continues to Slump

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
American consumer confidence in the economy eroded further this month to the weakest level since March, the Conference Board said yesterday.
The results of the board's survey reflected growing uncertainty about the recovery from recession. Consumers' attitudes were more negative than in July, regarding both the current situation and expectations for the immediate future. 
 "There now appears to be scant likelihood of any significant quickening in the pace of economic growth in the immediate months ahead," the business research group predicted.
Economists said the weak job market and the economic oratory generated by the Presidential election campaign were making consumers more wary of spending. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index, which assesses consumer sentiment on a monthly basis, fell 3.2 points from July to 58 this month. In July the index fell a revised 11.4 points from the previous month. Since June the index has fallen about 20 percent. In March the index was 56.5.
"The present low reading is historically associated with a lackluster economy," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. "The promise of business recovery, which was suggested by the markedly improved confidence readings recorded in the spring, has all but withered away."
The gain in the spring months had been considered an important sign that consumers were growing more confident about their finances.
Gary Ciminero, chief economist at the Fleet Financial Group, a large regional banking company in Providence, R.I., said consumer confidence had reached a low enough level to generate concern.
"It's not a good portent for George Bush or for the economy," Mr. Ciminero said. "The economic recovery, if you want to call it that, is going to be working against the headwind of very slow consumer spending."
The Consumer Confidence Index, calculated on a 1985 base of 100, is compiled from responses to questionnaires sent to 5,000 households nationwide to assess financial and job security. The questions cover topics ranging from personal buying plans to the outlook for business and employment.
Many economists pay close attention to the index, which provides insight into consumer attitudes toward spending and borrowing. Consumers account for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity and drive recovery and expansion.
This month, only 10 percent of those surveyed said they believed that present business conditions were good, but more than four times as many said they were bad. That is weaker than in July.
On employment, the figures are even worse. Only 5.5 percent of all respondents said jobs were "plentiful," but more than eight times as many said they were "hard to get." That is also weaker than July.
The despondency over job security has been reinforced by large-scale layoff announcements in recent weeks and the Government's own employment data, which have shown that the economic recovery is not producing many new jobs.
Consumers are similarly less secure in their expectations for the months ahead. The survey shows that 18.4 percent expect business conditions to improve, while 13.9 percent fear they will worsen. In July about 20 percent believed that business conditions would get better.
One out of eight respondents worried that family income would decline in the next six months.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Dollar's Fall Alters Bond Dynamics

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Bad economic news is usually good for the bond market. Traders, speculators and investors translate a decline in car sales, or a sluggish increase in jobs, into the expectation of slow economic growth, which in turn means that inflation will decline and the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates. And low inflation and low interest rates send bond prices higher.
But the plunge in the dollar since the end of last week seems to have temporarily changed that formula. 
 Take, for example, the decline in consumer confidence reported yesterday. The Conference Board said that confidence fell to its lowest level since March and that its index had fallen 20 percent in three months.
 
Dollar Changes the Equation
 That is the kind of bad news that has been good for the bond market recently. But not yesterday. The reason is that the drop in confidence also brought the dollar lower initially, and that scared traders more than enough to offset the initial boost from the Conference Board report.
"We got ourselves into an unfortunate trap where bad news seems to cut both ways," said Stephen Slifer, financial market economist at Lehman Brothers.
In late trading, the prices of bonds and notes were off modestly across the board, giving up the gains they made in the morning, even though the dollar managed to stop its decline and end a smidgen higher in New York.
The auction of $15 billion in new two-year notes also did not go too well. Demand was not strong and the average yield of 4.30 percent was 21 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, above where the yield was in the preauction, or when-issued, market last week, before the decline in the dollar pulled the bond market down with it.
 
Yield Inches Higher
 In late trading yesterday, the yield on the new note had inched higher to 4.34 percent. The five-year note auction today could also be difficult, traders said, if the yield does not hold at the 5.75 percent of yesterday or even inch up a little to attract long-term investors.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7.25 percent 30-year bond was offered in late trading at 9712/32 , down 10/32 to yield 7.47 percent, up from 7.44 percent Monday. The 10-year bond was also off 10/32 to yield 6.72 percent, up from 6.68 percent. Shorter maturities were also off for the day.
 
Foreign Bonds
 Bond markets in Britain, France and Italy fell sharply yesterday as several new opinion polls raised doubts about whether French voters would approve the Maastricht Treaty. That pact outlines the steps Europe would take toward an integrated economy and a single currency by the end of the century.
"The markets are warming to the idea that the French may vote no," said George Magnus, chief international bond economist for S. G. Warburg Securities in London.
"It is clear that the number of undecideds has fallen, and fallen in favor of the no's." he said. "Even if there is a very slender yes vote, after a week or two Maastricht will not be retrievable."
Such a no vote, in the referendum scheduled for Sept. 20, would probably eliminate any chance that Europe could move to a unified economy in an orderly way. More important, there would be growing doubts about the future of the European Monetary System, which has brought stability to currencies. In addition, European countries' efforts to lower inflation and curb government deficits might lose their momentum.
The doubt about the outlook for the French referendum just added to the trouble bond markets already faced as the American dollar continued to decline yesterday. The dollar hit a new intraday trading low of 1.3945 marks to the dollar before it recovered to finish slightly higher in New York.
In Britain, the 10-year bond futures contract was down about 5/8 point. In France, the 10-year bond contract was off 3/4 point. In Italy, where bonds have been hit the hardest recently, the bond contract was off about a third of a point.
Both Britain and Italy have the added problem of very weak currencies that are threatening to breech the bottom of their trading limits in the European Monetary system. If this happens, it is likely that both countries would have to raise interest rates, a fear that is also troubling their bond markets.
In Germany, bonds held steady, in part because that market is one where the uncertainty about the dollar and the doubts about the Maastricht treaty is having comparatively little effect. The markets that are suffering the most are those where there is the most chance of higher interest rates or a currency devaluation because of the dollar's decline. A devaluation is an alternative to raising interest rates.
The opinion poll that rocked the markets was one for Paris Match magazine, showing the treaty being rejected by a 51-to-49 percent margin. Although several other polls released later in the day showed narrow support for the treaty, investors seemed to conclude that even a close vote for the treaty would set back the move to a unified Europe.

HEADLINE: Cultural 'Experiment' Changes Name at 60

 BODY:
In 1932, when a young couple in Syracuse began a program to bring people of different cultures together through one-to-one citizen exchanges, they called it the Experiment in International Living.
Sixty years and thousands of successful exchanges later, it is no longer an experiment. Not only does the organization have millions of alumni worldwide,but it also now administers 260 different programs in 67 countries. The Experiment's directors thus took the occasion of its 60th anniversary yesterday to announce a name change; it will be called World Learning Inc. 
 The nonprofit organization, based in Brattleboro, Vt., administers programs worldwide, including higher-education courses in international studies, management training and languages; an au pair program that uses families' needs for child-care helpers as a way to foster citizen exchanges; semester-abroad programs for college students in 35 countries; scholarships for inner city high school students to live with families abroad, and international development programs, like an AIDS prevention and control project in Uganda.
A 1932 camping trip to Europe with 23 other young adults led Donald and Leslie Watt to pioneer the concept of "home stays" among people of different countries. In 1961, the Kennedy Administration called on the organization to help develop the Peace Corps. The Experiment's president, Frank G. Boyce, served as the first director of the Peace Corps' division of private and international organizations.

HEADLINE: Nassau Clerk Agrees to Timetable for Clearing Backlog

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Aug. 25

 BODY:
The Nassau County Clerk's office, showing the first signs of overcoming long delays in recording documents, signed a consent decree today with the County Bar Association pledging to bring its work up to date within three months.
The agreement promises to remedy backlogs in granting index numbers and entering court judgments that lawyers complained were hindering their work in Nassau County. 
 In addition, court cases more than four years old, which had been off limits to lawyers because of a shortage of employees to retrieve the case files, would now be provided within three weeks, said A. Thomas Levin, the past president of the bar association who sued the County Clerk, Harold W. McConnell, over the backlogs.
 
'Exasperating' Negotiations
 Mr. Levin, who described negotiations on the agreement as "time-consuming and exasperating," said the changes would still allow the clerk's office some delays in performing its duties.
"They won't be the outstanding county clerk's office in the nation," Mr. Levin said, "but they'll at least be average."
In an era of dwindling tax revenues and a recession, the County Clerk's office has become a symbol of government ineptitude. Millions of dollars in undeposited mortgage and transfer taxes remain stuffed in envelopes at the same time that budget shortfalls have forced the county to move to double its mortgage recording tax to 2 percent.
Today's consent decree, which would take effect after approval by the Board of Supervisors next month, addresses only the office's court-related operations. It came after a State Supreme Court justice ruled that the clerk's office was not meeting its obligations in a timely fashion. Failure to comply with the consent decree could lead to a contempt of court citation for Mr. McConnell.
A separate section of the clerk's office responsible for recording mortgages and collecting related taxes and fees, which lost a separate lawsuit by the mortgage industry, would not be affected by the agreement. But officials at the New York State Land Title Association, which brought that suit, said they hoped the 25-week delay in recording mortgages would be reduced.
Michael L. Hopkins, a lawyer representing the County Clerk's office, said the targets in today's consent decree were "attainable and doable."
While nobody was available at the County Clerk's office today to describe what steps were being taken to reduce the backlog, estimated at 50,000 unrecorded mortgages alone, Mr. Hopkins said a new computer system and an employee-training program were already cutting delays.
"These are all things that had been worked toward well before the onset of any litigation," he said. "The thing really is moving along swimmingly."
The agreement would eliminate a current 48-day backlog for index numbers by Oct. 1 and would cut a half-year delay in entering court judgments to five days by Dec. 1.
 
'It's Embarrassing'
 By Dec. 1, the clerk's office would also deliver files of cases more than four years old within a week. Until today, the County Clerk's office routinely denied requests for those files, citing a lack of personnel to retrieve them from storage in Hempstead. Many of the cases were still unsettled, and the files for others were needed to enforce court judgments or to aid in subsequent litigation.
Benjamin Zwirn, the Democratic Supervisor of North Hempstead, said he was not encouraged by the agreement. "It's embarrassing that the lawsuit settlement calls for them to not bring it up to date but to only reduce the backlog by a couple of weeks," he said.
Mr. Zwirn, who had complained that millions of dollars in mortgage taxes and fees due North Hempstead were caught up in the backlog at the clerk's office, had petitioned Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to use his constitutional authority to remove Mr. McConnell from office.

HEADLINE: With Business Adrift, Marinas Cut Their Fees

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAMPTON BAYS, L.I., Aug. 21

 BODY:
It's been what Eliot Howell delicately terms a very quiet summer at Corrigan's Yacht Yard and Marine Sales on the Shinnecock Canal.
Slips have gone begging, even though rates are down about 20 percent. Rain has washed out weekend after weekend. Even on sunny days, fewer boats venture out, and often only for short trips. 
 "We are not a ghost town, but usage is down rather dramatically," said Mr. Howell, the marina's owner. "Basically, between the weather and the recession, people are just not using boats the way they did in the past."
Many marina operators are telling similar stories of a multibillion-dollar industry that seemed to have no limits five years ago, but now is hitting bottom.
With waiting lists for dock space suddenly a thing of the past and boat owners shopping for bargains, operators are scrambling as never before to attract customers with lower rates. "There is no question that slip prices are lower," said Ray Bovich, the president of the Connecticut Marine Trades Council. "The operators realize that this is a marketplace based on discretionary income."
Seasonal slip rentals range from $35 to $75 a foot, industry officials and marina operators said. Dick True, executive secretary of the Empire State Marine Trades Association said prices had dropped as low as $25 on inland waterways. The season is from April 1 to Nov. 15.
 
'Too Many Slips'
 For some, adjustments have come too late. Since 1989, the shrinking market has pushed scores of marina operators into bankruptcy and many others to the brink.
"The trend all over New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Rhode Island is too many slips, too many marinas," said John Brewer, the president of the Brewer Yacht Yard Group, which owns 13 marinas in five northeastern states.
The marina industry is big business in the region. Trade associations say there are about 1,200 commercial marinas in New York, 450 in New Jersey and 200 in Connecticut.
The marinas hit hardest by the recession, operators say, are the ones that also sold boats. When the new-boat market collapsed, dealers were left with finance costs for huge inventories they could not move. "The days of Sea Rays and Bayliners being produced like Fords and Chevrolets are gone," Mr. Brewer said.
A 10 percent Federal luxury tax on boats costing more than $100,000 has held sales flat, dealers complain, even as it has forced boat manufacturers out of business. The tax applies to the portion of the purchase price in excess of $100,000.
The National Marine Manufacturers Association in Chicago says the tax, which took effect in 1989, put 20,000 people out of work.
Marina operators also complain that they became a target for a spate of user fees just as the industry began its slide. In Connecticut, for example, Mr. Bovich said seven new taxes have been imposed on recreational boating since July 1989. He said these included a 6 percent state tax on labor and repairs, slip fees and winter storage.
In addition, many boat buyers attracted by easy bank credit during the 1980's got caught by the recession in the 1990's and no longer have boats to use.
"A lot of the banks went ga-ga, and now they are eating a lot of repossessions," said Mr. True, of the Empire State Marine Trades Association.
But repossessions only partly explain a mystery marina operators are brooding over. "The question is, where did all the boats go?" said Mr. Howell.
One answer may be that operating costs are keeping many boats out of the water entirely, or at least closer to port.
 
High Cost of Gasoline
 "Long trips are not doable in this economy," said Patricia Appey of Sayville, L.I., a manager for a franchising company.
Mrs. Appey and her husband, Carl, a semiretired computer consultant, rent a slip for their 38-foot Egg Harbor cruiser at Corrigan's, but have thought twice this year about filling its 300-gallon tank with gasoline that costs more than $1 a gallon.
The Appeys' traveling companions, Susan and Allan Schule, also of Sayville, took a trip this year in their 34-foot Silverton from Corrigan's to Newport, R.I., where Mrs. Schule said she was surprised to see how many restaurants and shops had changed hands or gone out of business since their last visit two years ago. She said there was also no problem finding a slip at a marina that once required reservations three months in advance.
"It was sad," said Mrs. Schule, who works as a secretary for her husband, an insurance agent. "It just wasn't as crowded as it used to be."
In their struggle to survive, marina operators are expanding repair and maintenance service, scheduling special events, and adding amenities like swimming pools and tennis courts to make their marinas into destinations, not merely departure points.
"Amenities are the key," said George F. Van Zevern, the editor and publisher of Marine-Dock Age, an industry trade journal. "You have to make the marina more than a storage depot for boats. You have to play up the family concept."
Boat owners rent dock space by the foot. For example, the owner of a 20-foot boat renting a slip at $50 a foot would pay $1,000 for the season. Boat owners pay marinas separately for winter storage, taking the boat in and out of the water, maintenance, repairs and gasoline. Some marinas charge extra for amenities like swimming pools or tennis courts.
 
Then Came the Rain
 Jeffery L. Strong, owner of Strong's Marina in Mattituck, L.I., said he combined lower slip fees with the scheduling of six "fun-type events" to lure boaters and their families this summer. A result, he said, was an increase in slip rentals over last year. Mr. Strong said he slashed the seasonal fee for a 20-foot boat to $750, from $1,400.
There are limits, however. "When they cut the slip fees, they are cutting their own throats," Mr. True said.
Industry spokesmen are sounding an upbeat note, saying that a rise in boat sales this spring heralded the start of a recovery that faltered only because of summer rain.
But this rainy season, coming on the heels of a 1991 season acknowledged as the industry's worst ever, optimism has been hard to come by.
At the Peconic Yacht Basin in Riverhead, L.I., the manager, Douglas J. Riemer, said nonstop rain on the weekend of Aug. 15 and 16 set a record at the 130-slip marina, which opened nine years ago. "We didn't sell one gallon of gas," said Mr. Riemer. "Four bags of ice and no gas; 1992 makes 1991 look good."
 
Some Are Doing Well
 Jack Weinberg, the dockmaster of the New London (Conn.) City Pier, said visiting yachts have been in short supply. "Last summer we had a lot of big boats that were on their way from Florida to Cape Cod," he said. "This year we never saw them."
Still, some marina operators report they are doing well. Dennis L. Snow, the owner of the Mystic Shipyard in Mystic, Conn., said he suspected a rise in transient visitors was explained by the newly opened Foxwoods Casino on the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation in nearby Ledyard.
"The weather was like dumping another recession on us," said Allan Davidson, the owner of the Green Cove Marina in Brick, N.J. "Otherwise we would have seen some positive things."

GRAPHIC: Photos: The recession and a summer of dismal weather have dealt a harsh blow to the multibillion-dollar marina industry. Eliot Howell, top, the owner of Corrigan's Yacht Yard in Hampton Bays, said that boat use was down "rather dramatically." Robert Garland, who was laid off from his job as a marine technician last month, washes and waxes boats at Corrigan's, but he is finding that work is still in short supply.

HEADLINE: Bank Yields On Accounts Decrease

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on bank money-market accounts and certificates of deposit were squeezed in the latest period ended today, The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest rate publication, indicated.
But a closer look shows money-market accounts are down a bit more than C.D.'s. This is because the money-market accounts reflected recent market trends for short-term rates before the weakened dollar drove the short-term rates up again. That rise was not that significant, however, because rates have remained at historic lows. 
 On Monday, at the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, rates rose for the first time in three weeks. Many interest- rate watchers consider the auction a fairly reliable barometer of how banks may eventually set rates for depositors in the weeks ahead.
The average rate at auction for a three-month bill climbed 4 basis points, to 3.14 percent, while for a six-month bill, the rate rose 6 basis points, to 3.24 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Some analysts speculate that rates will continue to slide through Labor Day; by then, the Federal Reserve will have had two months to assess the impact of its last cut in the discount rate on July 2. The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges banks for loans.
According to analysts at The Bank Rate Monitor, the last rate cut neither encouraged consumers and business to borrow, nor led banks to lend money more readily. Thus, some analysts believe that the Fed may be forced to ease credit further. But the current weakness in the dollar argues against such a Fed easing, and some analysts say the Fed could be forced to raise rates to support the dollar.
In the latest week, at New York-area banks, including commercial and savings, the combined average yield on a money-market account fell 3 basis points, to 3 percent, the yield on three-month certificates stabilized at 3.04 percent, and a six-month certificate slipped 1 basis point, to 3.24 percent.
At commercial banks, the cuts were mixed, with an average money- market account yield down 2 basis points, to 2.84 percent; a three-month certificate up 1 basis point, to 2.91 percent, and a six-month certificate unchanged at 3.07 percent.
Savings banks moved aggressively this week, cutting money-market accounts an average 4 basis points, to 3.16 percent. They sliced 1 basis point off the three-month C.D., to 2.91 percent, minor compared with the 5-basis-point cut the previous week. For a six-month C.D., the average yield slipped 3 basis points, to 3.41 percent.
For New York-area yields, the largest adjustments were at Carteret Savings in New Jersey, which pared 27 basis points from its money-market account, to 3.29 percent, and at Astoria Federal Savings, which cut the three-month C.D. 11 basis points, to 3.19 percent, and the six-month C.D. 15 basis points, to 3.25 percent.
Outside the New York market, the yields at 20 large banks were unchanged to slightly down, with an average bank money-market account holding at 2.9 percent and a six-month C.D. down 2 basis points, to 3.12 percent.

HEADLINE: Banks Planning to Lend To Aid Florida Cleanup

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Florida's largest banks said yesterday that they were ready to play a big role in financing the cleanup of South Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew.
The First Union National Bank and Barnett Banks Inc. announced that they would each provide $1 billion in loans to businesses and communities in the areas hit by the storm. 
 Nationsbank Inc. said it was preparing a program similar to the one carried out by its predecessor, the NCNB Corporation, after Hurricane Hugo devastated South Carolina three years ago. That $1.35 billion program included expedited loan approvals, preferential rates and flexible, tailored repayment terms to rebuild homes and businesses.
And Sun Banks Inc., the Florida subsidiary of Sun Trust Banks Inc., said it would provide customers as much assistance as necessary.
 
Lift to the Economy
 Bankers at these institutions emphasized that business considerations were not the primary motive in announcing the programs. But they acknowledged that the infusion of money needed for the cleanup could provide a needed lift to the South Florida economy.
"Nobody wants a disaster to generate business," Russ Hoadley, a spokesman for Barnett Banks, said in a telephone interview. "But we learned from our colleagues in South Carolina after Hugo and in California after the earthquakes that your customers really remember how you treated them during and immediately after one of these events. You can win 'em or you can lose 'em for a long time as a result of how you behave."
Banks in Flordida, like many big institutions, are flush with cash because of slack loan demand during the recession, tightened lending practices and heightened Federal regulation.
Early estimates of the damage ranged as high as $20 billion. Most of the destruction was in Dade County, which includes Miami and areas south of the city most devastated by the storm. The wreckage left on Florida's west coast around Naples as Andrew swept into the Gulf of Mexico was relatively minor.
 
More Time Needed
 Bankers and economists emphasized that it would be some time before the true cost of the storm was known.
"I have talked to people in Tallahassee who say they don't know where people are getting these estimates," said Tom Cunningham, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. "People won't know for some time how much damage was done. But the number will be big."
John Nabors, an executive vice president and head of credit administration at Sun Banks in Orlando, said his bank had not yet formulated any formal hurricane-related lending program. But the bank has a long history of responding to these sorts of disasters, he said.
"We have been through a lot of hurricanes since we set up here in 1934, and have a track record of providing assistance to our customers, be it $1 billion or $2 billion," he said.
As in much of the country, the recession had crimped loan demand in South Florida, Mr. Nabors and other bankers said. But in the wake of the hurricane, that condition is almost certain to change. And banks, which have been loading up on Treasury securities instead of making new loans for the last year or two, are in excellent shape to respond.
"There is a lot of liquidity in the banking system," Mr. Hoadley at Barnett Banks said. "But we would much rather have a surge in loan demand caused by a robust economy" than a disaster.

Gains in Vehicle Sales Are Less Than Expected

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Sales of cars and light trucks built in North America rose a disappointing 10.2 percent in mid-August, compared with a weak period last year. The increase fell far short of the recovery that auto makers had been expecting.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales was 6.2 million, up from 5.7 million in the first third of the month but well below the 7.0 million level that would herald the stirrings of robust demand. 
 "Clearly, we've seen the rate slipping for the last couple of periods, and that's consistent with other signals in the economy like the weak employment numbers and the low levels of consumer confidence," said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York.
 
 
Strength in Truck Sales
 All percentage changes are adjusted to reflect the average daily selling rate, which depends on the number of selling days in each reporting period. There were nine selling days in the latest period and eight last year.
Domestic car sales for the 10-day period that ended on Aug. 20 edged down six-tenths of a percent, to 160,595, from the 143,541 sold in mid-August 1991.
Light-truck sales rose a robust 27 percent, to 130,245, from 91,131 a year earlier. Strong light-truck sales tend to lead the auto industry out of recessions, an important reason that auto makers have been expecting a gain in car sales.
Over all, domestic vehicle sales for the period rose to 290,840, from 234,672 last year. Vehicles are considered domestically made if they are produced in Canada and Mexico, as well as the United States.
The General Motors Corporation continued to struggle, with its car sales falling 7 percent, to 63,585. Only Cadillac and Saturn posted increases among G.M.'s car divisions. G.M.'s light-truck sales, however, rose 19.3 percent, to 48,506, mostly because of sharp increases for full-size pickups.
The Ford Motor Company strengthened its share of the American automotive market with double-digit increases in cars and light trucks. Sales of Ford's domestically built cars rose 13.7 percent, to 48,569, while the company's light-truck sales rose 36.7 percent, to 44,418.
Ford's Mercury Sable, Mercury Topaz and Mercury Grand Marquis sold strongly during the period, as did the Ford Taurus, Crown Victoria, Thunderbird, Escort and Tempo. Sales of pickup trucks and Explorer sport-utility vehicles were also sharply higher.
The Chrysler Corporation's sales of domestically built vehicles were estimated by Ward's Automotive Reports at 41,300, up 7.3 percent from 34,200 last year. Chrysler reports its sales on a monthly basis only.
The Honda Motor Company reported a 16.5 percent drop in sales to 14,080 cars, from 14,983 last year.
 
 
Toyota Sales Are Up
 The Toyota Motor Corporation said sales of Corolla and Camry models built in North America rose 9.8 percent, to 12,289, from 9,946 in mid-August last year. Toyota also sold 2,857 domestically built compact pickups, which it did not produce in North America a year earlier.
The Mazda Motor Corporation sold 2,741 domestically built cars and light trucks, up from 1,847 a year earlier.
Car dealers across the nation noticed inconsistent buying trends, adding to evidence that a sustained recovery has yet to materialize. Tom Chergey, sales manager for Fiermonti Oldsmobile-Saab in Concord, N.H., said, "I think my domestic sales are spotty because it's an election year, and no one knows what is going to happen."
But John Wiegers, general manager of Bob Allen Ford in Overland Park, Kan., said the preference for American-made vehicles "is still near the top of priority lists."
Bill Talbott, president of Greenbrier Motors, a Chrysler-Dodge dealership in Lewisburg, W.Va., said customers had wanted to trade for new cars for some time, but had not done so until recently "because they probably have caught up with their debt."

Oil Prices Stage a Retreat As Hurricane Fears Wane

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Oil prices retreated yesterday from sharp gains posted the day before as fears receded that Hurricane Andrew would wreak lasting damage on oil rigs and refineries along the Gulf Coast.
 "We're still at the mercy of the hurricane," said Tom Blakeslee, analyst at Pegasus Econometric. But he said other factors, including increased OPEC crude oil production and seasonal increases in North Sea output, pointed to lower prices. 
 "The hurricane probably won't do lasting damage to oil refineries so the market couldn't sustain the short-covering effort," said Jim Steel, an analyst with Refco.
 October crude oil sank 39 cents, to $21.15 a barrel, giving back most of Monday's 46-cent gain. September unleaded gasoline dropped 0.60 cent, to 62.13 cents a gallon, and September heating oil fell 1.08 cents, to 58.23 cents a gallon.
Cotton prices also receded after posting the maximum gain on Monday, when traders feared that hurricane-driven rains might swamp the Mississippi Delta crops.
 October cotton, which jumped 2 cents a pound Monday at the New York Cotton Exchange, fell 1.23 cents to close at 58.95 cents a pound.
 Grain futures were slightly higher, with the hurricane seen as an equalizing factor: more rain could help some crops while the storm may damage others.
 State crop reports issued Monday afternoon showed the expected record corn crop was still behind in development, making it vulnerable if an early freeze strikes.
 September wheat rose 4 cents, to $3.25 a bushel; September corn added 1.4 cents, to $2.26 1/4 a bushel; September soybeans firmed 2.25 cents, to $5.62 a bushel, and September oats lost three-quarters of a cent, to $1.29 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Sifting for Profits in Keating's Desert Monument

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHOENIX

 BODY:
Sprawled across 130 desert acres on the southern slope of Camelback Mountain, the $300 million Phoenician resort is one of the most expensive hotels ever built. The guests have tea amid a $1.7 million art collection, play on a top-notch irrigated golf course and swim in a pool that is lined in mother-of-pearl tile. Some travel magazines rate it among the top resort hotels in the world.
"It's a spectacular property," said Saul F. Leonard, hotel consultant based in Los Angeles. "But was it built to make money or as a monument?" 
 He and others suggest that the founder, Charles H. Keating Jr., caused this great 580-room Phoenician to rise out of the Sonoran Desert as a kind of monument to himself. And this, they say, is what it has become.
 
Glitter May Not Mean Profits
 Mr. Keating is now serving a 10-year sentence in a California prison for his role as a principal architect of the nation's savings and loan scandal, brought on in large measure by excessive and overextended real estate dealings.
The Phoenician, with its glitter and opulence -- and fame -- is attracting tourists in relatively large numbers. But the question is whether, given its enormous costs, it can ever reach profitability.
The hotel's troubles date almost to its opening, on Oct. 1, 1988. Within five months the Federal Government found itself the unproud owner, taking it over after Mr. Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan and the parent company, the American Continental Corporation, declared bankruptcy.
Soon after that, Federal agents and Phoenix plainclothes police officers staged a predawn raid on both hotels and sealed off Mr. Keating's office in the Phoenician. They fired him and discharged 25 employees, including Mr. Keating's wife, Mary Elaine, two daughters and two sons-in-law.
Last year, eager to be rid of the property, the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency set up to take over failed savings institutions and their properties, sold the Government's 55 percent interest in the Phoenician and in a sister hotel in Phoenix, the Crescent, for a total of $111.5 million. Mr. Keating had built the Crescent, for business travelers, in 1987 for $50 million.
The buyer was the Government of Kuwait. At first glance, considering the initial cost of the two hotels, the Kuwaitis might again seem to have become the beneficiary of not insubstantial United States aid.
The Kuwaitis are generally regarded as shrewd investors, and they are hardly strangers to the desert. But some analysts now doubt that they can ever extract profits from the Phoenician.
Not that the hotel has proved unpopular. In fact, its notoriety is thought by some to be an advantage in that respect.
"Our occupancy rate year-to-date is averaging over 70 percent," said Hans D. Turnovszky, the hotel's president and general manager. That compares with a 66.1 average occupancy rate for all resorts in the United States last year, according to Smith Travel Research.
"Usually it would take years and a tremendous amount of money for an independent property to get the kind of name recognition the Phoenician got for free," said Vicki Bhandari, the senior hospitality consultant for Kenneth Leventhal & Company, a Phoenix accounting firm that specializes in resort hotels. "But the Phoenician was helped by all the reports about the savings and loan troubles."
Four hours after Mr. Keating was dismissed, Mr. Turnovszky was installed at the Phoenician, arriving fresh from managing the Lodge at Vail in Vail, Colo. In all, he has managed hotels and resorts on four continents,
From the beginning, as part of his plan to restore the hotel's image, Mr. Turnovszky refused to discuss Mr. Keating. "When anyone asked, I said: 'It's not my problem. It's the Government's problem,' " Mr. Turnovszky said. "I never met the man."
 
Working for the Kuwaitis
 Mr. Keating, before his empire unraveled, had already sold 45 percent of the Phoenician and Crescent to the London-based Kuwait Investment Office for $173.6 million. That office, a little-known arm of the Kuwaiti Government, handles the country's portfolio of foreign holdings, which has been estimated at between $80 billion and $100 billion.
The investment office has usually avoided the limelight, except when it bought a 21.6 percent stake in British Petroleum after privatization of the oil company in 1987 -- and was subsequently ordered by the British Government to scale back its investment to 9.9 percent.
As a matter of policy, the Kuwaitis themselves refuse to discuss any aspect of their investment in the Arizona hotels. Mr. Turnovszky says he sends his employers monthly reports and flies to London to attend quarterly meetings of the nine-person board, of which he is a member.
"They are very interesting to work with," he said of the Kuwaitis, "because they are very astute and knowledgeable, and they treat business as business." The Kuwaitis, he says, believe that the Phoenician is a good investment and that Arizona is a growing market.
Under Mr. Turnovszky, the hotel has been aiming for a 50 percent mix of business and leisure travelers, and more foreign guests. Foreign visitors now account for 15 percent of the resort's total business, up from 2 percent a few years ago, thanks in part to sales agents in many countries and to its membership in the Leading Hotels of the World Ltd., an association of luxury hotels that share a worldwide reservations system.
But are luxury resort hotels, surrounded by other luxury resort hotels, necessarily good investments -- even in a revitalized economy? Especially one that to break even, Mr. Turnovszky says, must fill 60 percent of its rooms each night at an average rate of $450?
Not everyone thinks so.
Edward Watkins, the editor of Lodging Hospitality magazine, calls the Phoenician "a boondoggle from the beginning." In 10 years, he said, "I don't think it will be the quintessential Phoenix resort, or at the top of the market."
Room rates range from $280 to $415 a day in winter, single or double occupancy, to suites from $775 to $1,300. Both presidential suites are often occupied -- at a cost of $4,000 a night in high season.
But most hotels here, including the Phoenician, reduce their rates about 50 percent in the summer, when temperatures soar well above 100 degrees.
The daily room rate at Arizona's 20 leading resorts last year averaged only $121, according to Kenneth Leventhal & Company. Leventhal does not break out rates for individual hotels, but one analyst knowledgeable about Phoenix hotels said the Phoenician, whose financial numbers are closely guarded, probably averages $180 a night, or about 40 percent below the precious break-even point.
"The problem for the Phoenician," the analyst said, "is that there are too many resorts here chasing too few guests."

HEADLINE: Net Off for Bayer of Germany

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Aug. 25

 BODY:
Bayer A.G., inventor of the Bayer aspirin, reported a big drop in profits today, but said it could not issue its figures in the United States, where a court ruling prevents the company from operating under its own name.
 Bayer said second-quarter earnings fell 11.5 percent, to 942 million German marks, or $662.1 million. That compared with 1.07 billion marks, or $748.6 million, a year earlier. 
 Bayer, one of the world's biggest chemical companies, blamed a sputtering world economy and a weaker dollar for the results.
 "This fall in earnings was caused by continued pressure on prices, especially in the sectors geared to the manufacturing industry," Bayer said in the report, "and the situation was exacerbated by adverse exchange-rate movements."
 The company distributed the results worldwide, but excluded the United States because of a ruling handed down in July by a Federal court in New York on an issue that dates back to World War I.
 "We are not allowed to use the Bayer name in any way or any form in communication with the general public," said a Bayer spokesman, Thomas Reinert.
 Bayer's United States assets -- including its trademark and the famous Bayer aspirin label -- were confiscated during World War I and auctioned off to Sterling Products Inc. for $5.31 million.
 The Bayer trademark now belongs to Sterling Winthrop Inc., a subsidiary of the Eastman Kodak Company.
 During the 1950's, Bayer said it began to rebuild its business in the United States under the name Rheinchem Inc. through joint ventures and acquisitions.
 It paid Sterling Drug Inc. $25 million for limited use of the name Bayer in the United States six years ago in a deal that allowed it to sell nonpharmaceutical and nonconsumer products through Bayer USA Inc.
 "But then Sterling got the impression that we were overstepping the rights accorded to us under the 1986 agreement," Mr. Reinert said.
 Following unsuccessful negotiations in 1990, through which Bayer tried to get back full use of its trademark, Sterling sued the German company.
 Bayer said the United States District Court in Manhattan ruled on July 22 that it had violated Sterling's ownership rights to the Bayer name and trademark in the United States.
 Bayer has appealed the court ruling, and industry sources say the appeal could succeed on the ground of the First Amendment right to free speech. A spokesman for Sterling Winthrop in New York had no immediate comment today.

HEADLINE: The Pop Life

BYLINE: By Peter Watrous

 BODY:
New for Bobby Brown
Four years ago the singer Bobby Brown released his "Don't Be Cruel" (MCA) and changed the black-pop firmament, relegating older styles to the pop dustbin. Mr. Brown and two other acts, Keith Sweat and Guy (and their producers), came up with new jack swing, a style that mixes hip-hop rhythms and pastiche with soul singing and fervor. Mr. Brown not only sold six million copies of his album but also got himself arrested in Columbus, Ga., for lewdness during a performance. Since then he has formed his own record label, fathered some children, lavishly married the singer Whitney Houston (who is pregnant) and toured.
But four years is a long time, and in pop terms Mr. Brown, who had built an audience of both black and white teen-agers, has to start all over again with his new album, "Bobby" (MCA). Second albums after huge successes have been wilting recently; just ask Hammer, Slaughter, Firehouse and Wilson Phillips. At this point, is Mr. Brown a player at all? 
 MCA records has shipped a million or so copies of the record but has been cautious in its marketing. Instead of forcing retailers to buy huge quantities, inflating sales figures, the company laid off.
"This is a major recession we're in," said Jonathan Coffino, the senior vice president of sales at MCA. "It's a radically different economic environment than when 'Don't Be Cruel' was released." He said that he thought the record would do extremely well and that the label was releasing a couple of singles from it "to get it really going."
"The only people that don't have to do that anymore are country acts," Mr. Coffino said, "and that's because their demographic is so huge."
The record company held listening sessions around the country for radio, retail and the press. The first single, "Humpin' Around," was released to black and top 40 stations simultaneously to try to capture both black and white audiences. This week in Billboard, the single had already broken into both the rhythm-and-blues top 10 and the general top 10. Still, buyers at some larger chains report lukewarm pre-release interest in the album, saying that both Eric Clapton's "Unplugged" and a Christmas album by Garth Brooks were generating more interest.
"A lot of radio stations are adding 'Humpin' Around' to their play lists," Lew Garrett, the vice president of buying at the Camelot record chain, said of Mr. Brown. "But he's been away a long time. Do kids still remember or care? Urban audiences are good about that, they'll remember him. But the key is whether white kids remember or care. The pop audience is what took him to six million, and whether that can happen again is subject to debate. Given the record on follow-up albums, kids' attention spans are pretty limited."
But more than anything, big records depend on music. Mr. Brown's "Bobby" is where black pop is today, a nearly perfect example of pop songwriting and production. With contributions from the best producers working, including Teddy Riley, the head architect of new jack swing, and the team of L. A. Reid and Babyface, the album has a rhythmic urgency that's helped out by distinct melodies that radio will love. The album moves from the hard funk of the lead single, "Humpin' Around," to the ballads of " 'Til the End of Time," and duets with Ms. Houston and Debra Winans. On "Don't Be Cruel," Mr. Brown sang as if he was a better dancer than singer, which he was. But he has improved and moved from boy to man. There's a passion and urgency in his voice that makes the standard pop love stories seem believable.
"I wanted to make an album that was vocally better," he said. "The album took a long time, nearly a year to make, because it took a lot of planning, because I wanted to keep appealing to a wider audience. And I wanted to create new ideas, to find a new trend, a new sound that would be appealing to my audience. That's the toughest part of making a record, picking the right songs, the right sounds.
"But a lot of things have changed in the last four years. Grab your seat: I've grown and matured. I've become real appreciative of the things I have. I don't want to lose focus, which I could have, because there are so many temptations on the road. Though if I had stayed at home and never become anybody, there'd probably be more. I've gotten married, opened up a studio in Atlanta, started a record label. I'm still myself, but Whitney has really lent me a lot."

 No woman has really made it big in new jack swing; it's been an exclusively male domain. Enter Mary J. Blige, whose recent first album, "What's the 411?" (Uptown/MCA), is racing up the charts on the strength of the first single, the wistful "You Remind Me." Ms. Blige (pronounced as in "oblige"), a native of New York, found her circuitous way to Uptown records with help from the singer Jeff Redd. Andre Harrell, the head of Uptown and one of the industry's most acute talent scouts, having signed Guy, Jodeci and others, saw what he wanted immediately.
"She sang for me in my office," Mr. Harrell said. "I thought that she could be a major female soul singer. I thought she could be the queen of hip-hop soul, which is exactly what she is becoming."
"What's the 411?" has some fine singing on it, surprising in a genre not known for fine singing. Ms. Blige, almost inevitably, comes from a gospel background, and she imbues her singing with loss and longing.
"I've been singing in church, around the house and in school," she said. "I sang in the choir in my church in Yonkers, I sang lead and I could never figure out why the members wanted me to sing lead, but I did it."
There are thousands of churchgoing virtuoso singers, but they don't all have Ms. Blige's sense of style or attitude. She's an around-the-way girl, a hip-hop culturist, and it shows in her demeanor.
"I'm not sure why there hasn't been another new jack swing woman, really," she said. "There's nothing wrong with being hard-core. I grew up in a neighborhood where that's all there was. If people are looking for long dressed and high-heel shoes, they'd better look somewhere else."
Mr. Harrell has an idea why women have been so scarce in the genre.
"There hasn't been a woman with the voice and the life style and the attitude of an inner city young adult girl. I had one other girl I signed five years ago, but we couldn't get along. I had my eye set on developing the right girl, and Mary was just right. She embodied the attitude: cool, humble, soulful. She reflects the reality of today's black girl, so she'll sell."

HEADLINE: Eating Well

BYLINE: By Marian Burros

 BODY:
THE story of food irradiation bears a striking resemblance to the story of silicone breast implants: proponents are ignoring the risks while promoting the benefits.
The crucial difference is that many scientists are trying to prevent approval of the irradiation process until its safety has been tested to everyone's satisfaction, instead of letting it go on the market first. The public, always squeamish when words connected with radioactivity are used, is not rushing to embrace irradiated foods. Last winter, a store in North Miami Beach, Fla., received widespread publicity when it put irradiated strawberries on the market, but it is not clear how well they sold. 
 Irradiation is hardly a new process; it has been around for 40 years but its prominence in food rises with each Government decision that advances its use. The Food and Drug Administration has declared irradiation, which is the bombing of food with gamma rays, safe for preserving certain foods; the World Health Organization also says irradiated food presents no health risks. This year, the United States Department of Agriculture published proposed regulations for irradiating poultry, and a food irradiation plant has opened in Florida.
But questions that have troubled scientists and environmentalists about food irradiation have never been answered satisfactorily. No one knows whether the process creates new chemicals at levels that may be harmful, or whether the loss of nutrients from irradiation is unacceptably high, or to what extent adding more processing plants that use nuclear components increases the risk of nuclear accidents.
The proponents of food irradiation ridicule these concerns. Opponents, they say, are Luddites, the same kind of people who once opposed pasteurized milk. Proponents see the process not only as a way to extend the shelf life of perishables like strawberries without using chemicals, but also as a way to kill harmful bacteria like the salmonella in poultry, a widespread problem. (Recently a noncontroversial method to kill salmonella has proven successful in tests. It involves dipping the carcasses in a bath of water and trisodium phosphate, a chemical used in food processing.)
Groups as diverse as the Public Citizen's Health Research Group, the American Association of Retired Persons and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. have asked the Agriculture Department to withdraw its proposal until all the safety questions are answered.
No one is saying that irradiated foods are radioactive; they aren't. But the question that causes the most concern is whether irradiation results in the formation of toxic chemicals and other "radiolytic" products, created when the bombardment of the food with gamma rays breaks up some of the molecules. In the 1970's, an internal task force of the F.D.A. estimated that 10 percent of these radiolytic products might be unique to irradiated foods, but it concluded that the amounts of such toxic chemicals that are formed -- like benzene, which causes cancer -- are too small to be significant.
Not everyone agrees. In "Food Irradiation: Who Wants It?" (Thorson Publishers Inc., 1987), Tony Webb, Tim Lang and Kathleen Tucker write: "It is safest to assume that there is no safe level of exposure to such chemicals; any dose can cause the initial damage that develops into a cancer." They add, "The fact that a chemical change is small does not eliminate the risk."
The F.D.A. based its approval of irradiation on only five or six animal studies. It had some 400 to choose from but said all the rest were flawed. Dr. Donald B. Louria, chairman of the department of preventive medicine and community health at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark, said the few studies on which the agency relied were also flawed. "Taken together," Dr. Louria wrote in his critique, "these studies could not possibly establish the safety of food irradiation. Indeed, two of the studies suggest the technology is not safe."
There is still another safety question: the usual dose of radiation does not kill the bacteria that cause botulism, a particularly virulent form of food poisoning. The bacteria that cause off-odors and flavors are killed, so in those cases where an odor might warn of spoilage, that safety mechanism would be gone.
The May issue of the Berkeley Wellness Letter, published by the University of California at Berkeley, quotes an article in the September 1990 issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that says the proponents of irradiation "have not produced any projections of the actual economic, or other, benefits of longer shelf life, especially in a developed country that has an abundant food supply." The Wellness Letter goes on to say: "Though it's also been claimed that irradiation will make insecticides and fungicides obsolete, there's some evidence that certain foods may be more vulnerable to the ravages of fungi and insects after irradiation."
Food safety is one consideration; loss of nutrients is another. According to the April issue of Nutrition Action, a health newsletter published by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in one study the vitamin C content of potatoes was reduced by 50 percent after the potatoes had been given a standard dose of radiation. In another study, one-third the level of radiation permitted by the F.D.A. reduced thiamin levels in pork by 17 percent, and a normal dose of irradiation reduced thiamin levels in chicken breasts by 9 percent. Vitamin E content was also affected.
Proponents of irradiation say vitamin losses in irradiated food are comparable to those that occur in cooking. But many foods that would be irradiated, like poultry and pork, would be cooked after irradiation, further depleting vitamin levels.
In "Food Irradiation: Who Wants It?" the authors also point out that selling irradiated food as fresh is deceptive because fruits and vegetables -- irradiated or not -- lose nutrients after picking. A six-week-old irradiated strawberry, though appearing fresh, would have less nutritional value than a non-irradiated strawberry a few days old.
Even though nuclear opponents do not ordinarily become involved in nutrition issues, this time they have, since the radioactive isotopes used to irradiate food pose potential problems to plant workers and people who live near the plant. Nuclear opponents say food irradiation plants would just add to the increasing problems of nuclear-waste disposal.
Dr. Shelden Margen, professor emeritus of public health nutrition at Berkeley, said: "There are potentially serious concerns about the issues of waste disposal, engineering safety, transport of radioactive material, production of new isotopes, handling by poorly trained personnel and others we haven't even thought of yet."
Because of consumer resistance to irradiated foods, many companies, including Kraft, Conagra, Kellogg, A.& P. and Kentucky Fried Chicken, have said no to them. So have some states. New York and New Jersey have moratoriums on the sale of irradiated food, and Maine has an outright ban.
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has asked the Agriculture Department to determine the safety of irradiated foods before they are permitted on the market.

HEADLINE: AT DINNER WITH: Rob Morrow;
He's No Peevish Dr. Fleischman, But He's at Home in Bagel Town

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
ROB MORROW was looking nothing like a petulant small-town doctor as he padded in to dinner in a baggy blue suit that could have been fairly cheap or very expensive: it was hard to tell. (Expensive, it turned out. "Issey Miyake," he confessed, abashed. "I'm a clothes horse and wish I wasn't, but I am.")
Mr. Morrow seemed a bit smaller in person than he does on television, and his face was overwhelmed by a thicket of hair and a beard he had let grow between seasons of his show, "Northern Exposure." He is now in Seattle, shorn again, filming episodes for the show's third season, which begins on CBS next month. He plays Joel Fleischman, a persnickety doctor from New York forced to begin his career in a backwater Alaskan town to repay the state of Alaska for sending him through Columbia medical school. 
 The network had low expectations for the show, a throwaway that was supposed to fade as quickly as an Alaskan summer. But with its literate scripts and its slyly off-kilter characters, like the truculent hermit (Adam Arkin) who is an accomplished chef and a New Republic writer, it has become a hit, a "Twin Peaks" for normal people. Much of its charm comes from Mr. Morrow, who earned his first Emmy nomination this year and who somehow makes peevishness sexy.
No pique was in evidence as Mr. Morrow settled down at a cozy table in the back of Josephina, a restaurant near Lincoln Center, which he chose because the chef is a high-school buddy and because he likes the food, which tends to be low in fat. Cheerfully, he explained his hair.
"I have to look a certain way all year round, so when I'm not working I don't do anything to it," he said. "I don't even comb it." As for the beard: "I don't even like the way it looks." His voice was quiet and had the familiar New York cadences, but was not querulous or combative the way Dr. Fleischman's can be. When he smiled, though, his eyes crinkled at the corners in fine Fleischman fashion.
The show is filmed in Seattle and in the tiny town of Roslyn, Wash., and the parallels between fact and fiction are all too obvious. Both Mr. Morrow and Dr. Fleischman are fierce New York City partisans who long for home. (Dr. Fleischman misses the bagels, and Mr. Morrow misses "the kind of vitality you get in New York.") Both have found themselves in Pacific Coast towns where the pace is slow, the people are unfamiliar and the weather is freezing. Mr. Morrow, whose Seattle home is a rented condo with a nice view, at least has more chances to escape than his character does; he often spends weekends among actor friends in Los Angeles.
"There's a certain correlation, geographically and sociologically," between himself and Joel Fleischman, he said. "But Joel is a lot more belligerent than I would be: nasty and selfish."
And while Dr. Fleischman works hard, so does Mr. Morrow. For more than a year, he has devoted most of his spare time to a short film about a young boy and his abusive stepfather. The film, which he wrote, directed and produced, is called "The Silent Alarm," and he thinks it will be ready for next spring's film festivals.
Mr. Morrow's parents were divorced when he was growing up in Hartsdale, N.Y., and he remembers what it was like to be a child struggling to make sense of a world he couldn't control. He tries to project this sense in his film, which he made with no dialogue, explaining that children often can't articulate what they feel. "At that age, at 7, you're conscious enough to have a visceral awareness, but you're not old enough to either, A, articulate, or B, stand up for yourself," he said. Although he said it was not autobiographical, "the film presented itself to me in terms of some events I had heard about, thought about and imagined."
Mr. Morrow manages to stand up for himself now, so much so that stories portraying him as spoiled and bratty began to circulate this summer when he put off returning to the "Northern Exposure" set, holding out for a salary increase. (He was earning about $18,000 an episode.) He finally showed up, without missing any work, but the producers sued him for breach of contract and threatened to replace him.
All that was resolved in mid-July, when the lawsuit was dropped and Mr. Morrow got a raise. (How much, he wouldn't say.) It is his contention that people should remember that for much of his adult life he was unemployed and broke. "You see all those numbers about what actors make, but it's not that simple," he said. "If you amortize what I'm making over 12 years of not making any money, it's not that impressive."
Although he may seem like a friendly guy effortlessly playing a like-minded character on television, Mr. Morrow takes a serious, precise approach to his craft. Some people say his fussing and intense concentration make him a prima donna.
"I'm insecure, with all of the obvious neuroses that actors tend to have," he said. "But anyone who would consider me a prima donna doesn't understand what acting is. I'm not saying, 'Light me this way,' 'No, that's not a good angle,' 'I won't wear that color.'
"What I do is, sometimes I get upset and vehement. If someone wants me to sit and it doesn't feel right, no one can make me do it, and it causes conflicts. I don't mean from a bellicose point of view. But it does become a question, sometimes, of 'Do we waste time trying to get Rob to do it, or do we just give in and let him do it his way?' "
Mr. Morrow likes to while away the extra hours in Seattle on the golf course. He is learning tai chi from a videocassette and still feels twinges from a rotator cuff injury that he got while knee-boarding, a variation of water-skiing, more than a year ago. About to turn 30, Mr. Morrow admits to having "a great fear of death." Still, he gets a certain kick out of doing what he likes.
"As an adult, I realize if I don't like the first 50 pages of a book I don't have to finish it, and if I order a bottle of wine, I don't have to drink the whole thing," he said, ordering a bottle of wine but not drinking the whole thing, or even half. He goes to the movies all the time, often alone, but leaves early if he doesn't like it, which is most of the time. "I feel obligated to see a lot of movies because I feel a part of this business," he said, "and if the energy and focus is going to go into them, I should see them. But it's a rare movie that can transport me."
It first happened to him when he was very young and his parents took him to see "2001: A Space Odyssey."
"I just remember not having a clue what it was, but the imagery was so powerful, it tapped into a kind of spiritual place within me," he said. "I've seen it eight times." He has also seen nearly every episode of "Twilight Zone"
"They all had a little moral in them," he said.
Chatting about the mysterious differences between men and women, which he said prompted him to have his ear pierced ("I liked the kind of feminine aspect of it, even though I will never get to the point where I really understand where you are," he explained), Mr. Morrow ate some but not all of his melange-of-vegetable soup and a pasta dish.
The head chef, Louis Lanza, a classmate from Edgemont High School in Westchester, came out to catch up. Mr. Morrow likes Mr. Lanza a lot, but does not remember Edgemont High fondly. He lost interest in school completely by his senior year, dropped out, moved to Manhattan to become an actor and supported himself with a series of fledgling-actor jobs, like balloon-messenger.
With his longtime girlfriend, whom he politely refused to discuss or even name, he helped found an acting troupe called Naked Angels in 1986. Loving the theater, Mr. Morrow tried to avoid working in television, although he played some unmemorable parts, including a hunky bartender in the unsuccessful NBC series "Tattinger's."
"I said 'No, no, no,' for a couple of years, but I was so much in debt that I thought, 'I have to be an adult here,' " he said.
"Northern Exposure" seemed different: "It read like no other TV pilot I'd read," he said, "and it was not morally reprehensible."
Despite such unanticipated delights as being the host of "Saturday Night Live" this year ("It was like being Mick Jagger," he said), Mr. Morrow worries about being forever typecast as Joel Fleischman. "I was at a wedding recently, and a person who I know slightly said, 'Hey, Joel,' " he recalled. "I didn't know what to say. I don't want to be called Joel. It's not my name."
Mr. Morrow had to leave, and the taxi dropped him off at his brownstone apartment in the West 70's. He was due to leave soon for Seattle and was scrambling to get more work done on his movie. Why didn't he take a break, he was asked.
"You're talking about someone who is naturally disposed to anal-retentiveness," he said matter-of-factly, and he could well have been describing Joel Fleischman, M.D.

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times;
Baseball's Strange Bedfellows

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
LET'S try to understand this. The Chicago Cubs, owned by the Tribune Company, are in the forefront of a crusade to get Fay Vincent. One of the major reasons a group of owners wants to get Vincent is that baseball has serious economic problems, which he hasn't solved and won't let them solve by trying to bust the union.
 But the Tribune Company, which happens to have a history of taking severe positions against unions, is also the outfit that allowed the Cubs to make Ryne Sandberg the highest-paid player in baseball history. Leapfrogging over the $6 million plateau -- Bobby Bonilla had reached $5.8 million -- the Cubs signed Sandberg last March to a contract extension, effective in 1993, that will average $7.1 million a year. 
 Owners of other clubs collectively shook their heads in despair. Escalating salaries are killing them (they were unable to eliminate them via collusion) and here one of their own went bonkers. Some owners said angrily that the Cubs weren't signing a baseball player, they were signing a matinee idol: a handsome and talented television star who would attract viewers and improve the ratings for superstation WGN.
The Tribune Company, its critics said, didn't care what the Sandberg signing would do to the salary scale. In the days that George Steinbrenner executed intelligent but expensive free-agent signings, he bristled at charges that he created new salary plateaus. He always blamed someone else, saying another team got there first.
 But the Tribune Company was so far beyond everyone else, it couldn't find a scapegoat. The Sandberg signing instantly put small-market teams like the Baltimore Orioles and the Minnesota Twins at risk with their franchise players who could be free agents after this season. The Orioles have found a way to sign Cal Ripken Jr.; the Twins squandered one opportunity to sign Kirby Puckett and hope to have another. But the Tribune Company won't care if the Sandberg signing results in the Twins' loss of Puckett.
 The way some owners see it, the Tribune Company also cares more about its supersta tion than about the economic welfare of the teams its baseball team plays against. The Tribune Company cares so much about its superstation that it wants to oust the commissioner, who is trying to blunt the economic impact superstations have on the local television revenue of other clubs. But other owners ignore the Sandberg signing and the motive behind it, and they ignore the superstation effect.
 Instead of using their hands to applaud the commissioner for his efforts, these owners join hands with the company that costs them money in more ways than one. This unseemly game abounds in contradictions.
 Half of the existing National League clubs ask the commissioner to realign the league. He grants their wish and orders four teams to change divisions, bringing a lawsuit on his head and office. Now at least half of the half dozen teams are prepared to ask him to resign or face dismissal, legal or not.
 Vincent campaigns hard for new stadiums in Cleveland and San Francisco. He gives the Giants' owner, Bob Lurie, potentially critical bargaining leverage in San Francisco by telling him he can explore all of his options. Now the owners of the Indians and the Giants (who were also one of the N.L. teams urging realignment) are among his opponents.
 Peter O'Malley of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox, some owners say, do not care for each other (which is putting it kindly). Yet they are in the forefront of the move to get Vincent.
 O'Malley, who doesn't want to lose his West Coast rivalry with the Giants, is quoted by another owner as saying he will vote for the Giants' move to St. Petersburg, Fla., because Lurie joined the anti-Vincent faction.
 Some of the owners, at least, very likely want to get Vincent out of the way quickly so they can implement their strategy for the next round of labor negotiation: reopening their agreement with the players in December, then locking them out next spring. The union says it has heard that some owners want to shut down the game for the entire year so they can regain control over the players.
 "When this all came up with the commissioner last June and again now," Donald Fehr, the union chief said yesterday, "I asked what is it they want him to do that he won't do or what are they afraid he might do that they don't want him to do? I have heard rumors that a significant number of owners want to try to break the union."
 Before they try that, they have to break Vincent, whatever strange combination of conspirators the effort requires.

HEADLINE: The World Needs An Army on Call

BYLINE: By David Boren; David Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Americans are not enthusiastic about having the United States stand alone as the policeman of the world. There is a feeling that we simply no longer have the resources, given the pressing need to rebuild our strength at home, to play that role any longer.
This does not mean, however, that Americans have been lulled by the dangerous siren song of the new isolationists. We understand more clearly than ever that our economic well-being and national security depend on developments and relationships outside our borders. 
 No American, for example, wants to allow Saddam Hussein to thwart United Nations weapons inspections and rebuild his military capability. No American can remain indifferent to the images of starvation and brutality in detention centers in Bosnia and Herzegovina; the hideous policy of "ethnic cleansing" is something many of us never expected would occur again in our lifetimes. It has filled our people with a sense of moral urgency and an overwhelming feeling that we must do something to stop it.
But while Americans want something done, they do not want to do it alone. For the United States to act, the burden must be shared. It is time to create a genuine multilateral mechanism that can deal not only with these crises but also those that inevitably lie ahead.
Instead of shrinking from the task, we should welcome the fact that we are the first generation, perhaps in centuries, to have the opportunity to act boldly in the absence of confrontation between great powers.
The opportunity for the United Nations is clear. In the aftermath of World War II, President Truman wanted to empower the new United Nations to create a new world order. Addressing the General Assembly at its opening session in October 1946, he said, "We shall press for the preparation of agreements in order that the Security Council may have at its disposal peace forces adequate to prevent acts of aggression."
That promise was never realized because of the cold war and the Soviet Union's use of its veto power on the Security Council.
But under Article 43 of the United Nations charter, the Secretary General still has the authority to ask member nations to designate military units that can be deployed in the event of a crisis "to maintain international peace and security." In June, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali asked member countries to make that authority a reality.
Richard Gardner, a professor of international law at Columbia University, proposes that 40 to 50 member nations contribute to a rapid-deployment force of 100,000 volunteers that could train under common leadership and with standardized equipment. Intelligence could also be shared to allow the United Nations to anticipate problems and take preemptive action.
It is time for us to create such a force, and the United States should take the lead in proposing it.
Of course, details would have to be worked out. The War Powers Act would have to be amended to insure that the United States does not surrender its right to final approval of committing American troops to life-threatening situations. Members of the United Nations that lack veto power in the Security Council could condition their commitment to a rapid-deployment force on the right to withdraw units for their own urgent national security interests.
Still, the existence of such a force, uniformly trained and ready to act, would go a long way toward making the "new world order" more than just a slogan. It would help discourage regional conflicts, violations of basic justice, the proliferation of weapons and international terrorism.
History tells us that periods without confrontations and military contests between great powers are rare. We must seize this moment. History will hold us accountable if we do not.

Macy to Post Positive 4th-Period Cash Flow

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
R. H. Macy & Company has told its suppliers and their financial advisers that it expects to report positive cash flow for its fourth quarter ended July 31, reversing the results of the two previous quarters.
Although Macy will not issue financial statements for the fourth quarter or for July until the end of October, it disclosed information about its liquidity and its cash flow projections in a report to agencies that monitor retailers' credit as well as to garment industry financiers and some suppliers. 
 The company said its efforts to control expenses and inventory and maintain gross-profit margins had helped counter the effects of straitened economic conditions in regions of the country where its stores were concentrated.
 
A Promising Sign
 "Higher unemployment and weaker consumer confidence, particularly in the company's strongest market areas of San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles, continued to depress the sales performance of Macy's stores in July," Diane Price Baker, Macy's senior vice president and chief financial officer, said in the report Friday.
Despite depressed sales, Ms. Baker said, Macy's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortizationwould enable the retailer to satisfy the requirements of the debtor-in-possession financing package that was arranged when Macy filed for bankruptcy protection on Jan. 27. Debtor-in-possession financing gives companies that file under the bankruptcy laws a line of credit to pay for continuing operations.
Suppliers said Macy's ability to generate some positive cash flow despite weakened sales performance was encouraging. "I think it signals that they've spent some time getting their inventories into shape, and now there's a light at the end of the tunnel," said Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller Ltd., a fashion apparel manufacturer that ships its goods to Macy. "Are they out of the woods yet? Who knows, but it's a first good sign."
Mr. Konheim said the report would also help assuage concerns about Macy management's ability to stabilize the company's business.
 
Conservative Fall Strategy
 In its monthly financial report to the Federal bankruptcy court, Macy's has detailed losses that have raised eyebrows on Seventh Avenue. Macy reported an operating loss of $32.9 million in June, plus interest expenses and restructuring charges that brought its total loss for the month to $64.7 million.
The extent of the losses, which have been running at about $1 million a day, has caused some in the garment industry to wonder whether Macy would meet financing requirements.
As of Aug. 1, Macy's had access to $76.1 million in cash and $509.2 million of its debtor-in-possession financing. Ms. Baker said the company would start borrowing from its working capital this month to buy fall and holiday merchandise.
She said Macy's fall sales plan was conservative, taking account of the stagnant economy and a program to reduce promotions and markdowns.

HEADLINE: Balkans Session Is Long on Talk, Short on Action

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
An international conference on the crisis in the former Yugoslav republics opened here today to rousing condemnation of the Serbs from nearly two dozen nations, but virtually no calls for action beyond tightening economic sanctions and sending observers.
Only the Foreign Ministers of Turkey, speaking for the Islamic Conference, and of besieged Bosnia and Herzegovina, suggested that the use of force might be the only effective response. 
 The Bush Administration, arguing that a tighter embargo could weaken the Government in Belgrade and reduce its support for Serbian nationalists in Bosnia, proposed that international inspectors be sent in significant numbers to end what it said had been flagrant violations of economic sanctions.
 
'The U.S. Is Ready'
 Acting Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said in a speech to the conference that the goal of these measures would be to interrupt the shipment of goods into Serbia overland and along the Danube.
"We must resolve no longer to tolerate continuing and flagrant violations of the sanctions regime," he said.
"We will move quickly to place multi-national sanctions monitors in Romania," he said. "The United States is ready to contribute experts and equipment to this operation." He said similar arrangements should be made with Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania and Macedonia.
The conference on the Balkans is taking place in orderly, genteel London against a backdrop of news reports of some of the most intensive bombardment of Sarajevo and other Bosnian cities seen in weeks.
Mr. Eagleburger called these attacks an "outrage," and said that by the end of the session the talks, sponsored by the United Nations and the European Community, might propose punitive action. But by the end of today, State Department officials were expecting only position papers and a still-undefined plan of action for the sanctions and for observers.
Saying that the crisis in what was once Yugoslavia "was willed by men seeking to perpetuate Europe's last Communist regime by manipulating age-old hatreds and fears," Mr. Eagleburger also called today for the immediate stationing of human rights observers in areas that could be the next targets of Serbian nationalists: three regions in Serbia named Kosovo, Vojvodina and Sandzhak. Kosovo, in the south, has many residents of Albanian heritage, and Sandzhak, a region in Serbia northwest of Kosovo, has many Muslims.
Americans could be part of the human rights and sanctions-monitoring teams, officials said.
 
Tough Talk by Germany
 The toughest language of the opening session of the talks came from Germany's Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, who accused the Serbs, sitting across the table, of genocide and warned them that they would keep no land. Germany has had a long relationship with Croatia, and has been a leading critic of the Serbian leadership.
"Do not deceive yourselves," Mr. Kinkel said to the Serbs. "The international community will never accept the acquisition of territory through force and terror."
He accused them of a "war for a Greater Serbia" as ethnically pure as possible, and added that "here the root of crimes against humanity lie."
Mr. Eagleburger echoed the warnings later when he said: "History teaches that the conquests of past ethnic cleansers have tended to be short-lived."
The Acting Secretary of State welcomed an offer by some Serbs to permit the stationing of international observers along the Serbian-Bosnian border and at air bases in Serbia and Montenegro to prevent the movement of arms or supplies to Bosnian Serbs.
That pledge was made here on Tuesday and again today by Milan Panic, the Prime Minister of what remains of Yugoslavia -- made up of Serbia, the old Yugoslavia's largest republic, and Montenegro, its smallest. Mr. Panic is attending the talks as an individual because his government is not recognized as the successor to the old Yugoslav state.
 
Bosnian Serb Walks Out
 Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, did not oppose the idea when it was proposed, American officials said.
But as if to underline the divisions among Serbs, and illustrate the limited influence of Mr. Panic in Bosnia, the leader of Bosnia's ethnic Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, walked out of today's session because he had been relegated to observer status. His gesture was intended to demonstrate that he wanted equal status with the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"Bosnia-Herzegovina doesn't exist anymore as a state," Mr. Karadzic told the BBC.
Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence in March, following Croatia and Slovenia in departing from the Yugoslav federation, a nation born in 1918 of a group of "south Slav" peoples and religions.
Since the declaration of independence, the republic has been carved up into ethnic enclaves by militias in fierce fighting that has left thousands killed and hundreds of thousands homeless out of the total population of 4.3 million.
One Bosnian cease-fire after another has been declared and then quickly broken, and the Muslims, who make up almost half the population, have accused Serbia of being the aggressor.
Mr. Milosevic, who had a place at the table as the leader of Serbia, sat in stony silence through most of today's proceedings. American officials said that he had not sought a meeting with Mr. Eagleburger, a former United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia whom he has known for many years.
Mr. Panic told a reporter in Belgrade that he would have preferred to have Mr. Milosevic, the Serbian Communist-turned-nationalist, skip the conference. But, Mr. Panic said, Cyrus R. Vance, the former Secretary of State who is now the United Nations negotiator for the region, had urged both men to come.
"If I disagree with him in London, it looks like I'm a traitor," Mr. Panic, a Serbian-born American citizen, said before leaving for the talks. "If I agree with him, I look like I'm his man. But Cyrus Vance called me and told me to bring him, so that's what I'm doing."

New Planet Swims Into Canada's Ken: It's Mexico

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Taco Loco opened a month ago in Kensington Market in Toronto, with Maria Molinaro from Guadalajara offering her homemade cornmeal tortillas along with "autenticos" tacos, burritos, quesadillas, tostadas and tamales.
"We're doing great," said her husband, Sam Molinaro, at a table below the Mexican flag. "A lot of Canadians are getting to know Mexico through travel and business, and they really go for the Mexican food." 
 A few blocks away, at Bloor Street and Spadina, is the Taco Taco Taqueria, which opened two months ago. Lucky Jara, born in Mexico, raised in Ecuador, was stirring the pinto beans behind a delicatessen display case rendered Mexican by platters of hot peppers in huge pottery casseroles and a spectacular Mexican rag doll in a billowing, blue-flowered dress with an armload of fruits and vegetables.
"People are trying to hire me away," she confided, "but I'm happy right here." The owner, Sam Pinellis, is so happy that he plans to open two more taquerias.
 
Museums Plan Exhibitions
 A few doors from the Taco Taco Taqueria is the Viva restaurant, with a tractor-sized machine of stainless steel that can turn out 30 tortillas a minute.
Canadians have suddenly developed a fascination with Mexico. Not only are the fast-food shops and fancier Mexican restaurants thriving, after being virtually nonexistent in Canada five years ago, but vacation and business trips are also up dramatically and student exchange programs are more active than ever before. At least five museums in this the most populous region of Canada are to open major exhibitions on Mexican themes.
While Canadians have always had a keen intellectual interest in Mexican culture, the new attention largely reflects economic and business forces, including Canada's moves to join Mexico and the United States in a North American free trade area.
Many analysts see a natural alliance forming between the two countries as they discover common interests in their trade and other dealings with the world's remaining superpower.
 
Job Competition Feared
 "Canada and Mexico will be cooperating ever more closely to offset the overwhelming economic power of the United States," predicts Alan M. Rugman, professor of business economics at the University of Toronto.
Yet fears that North American free trade could mean job competition at least tempers some of the enthusiasm for the Mexicans. Opponents of free trade are expected to argue the need to protect jobs in the coming political battle over ratification of the trade pact.
Workers in apparel, footwear, toys and plastic products are considered vulnerable to greater competition from Mexico. On the other hand, there could be increased employment in high technology sectors like software and telecommunications as markets open in Mexico for Canada's wares.
Canadians have long flocked to Mexico for vacations, but only recently, mirroring increased prosperity in Mexico, are Mexicans starting to come here in important numbers.
Gonzalo Moreno, owner of a Mexico-Canada travel service, Moreno Tours of Toronto, said he was handling two to three busloads of Mexican tourists a week, whereas "we were lucky to get one busload five years ago."
Increasing student contacts are also deepening the relationship.
"My future may well be down there," said Alex Mercon of Seneca College in Toronto, who has just returned from six months' study at the Technological Institute of Oaxaca in southeastern Mexico.
"Mexicans are really moving ahead," added the 22-year-old student of international business. "Canada and the United States have stabilized, while Mexico has the real potential."
Strengthening business ties have contributed to the unusual surge of interest in Mexico by Canadian museums.
 
Others on the Bandwagon
 Robin Etherington, museum director in Guelph, a university town about an hour by car northwest of here, said that because a number of businesses in that area were considering expansion into Mexico, the "time is right" for an exhibition on Mexican culture. Her theme: "the phenomenal 5,000-year-old textile tradition in Mexico." In cooperation with the nearby Wellington County Museum and Archives, she has devised a display to open next November.
At least three other museums are on the Mexican bandwagon. The Art Gallery of Ontario has a show on tour of the works of Mexican artists active 30 to 60 years ago. The exhibition depicts their profound influence on Canadian artists.
"The Mexicans provided an exemplar for the socially conscious art that was of major importance to the development of art in Canada, and it was fortuitous that our show was contemporaneous with 1992 and the rediscovery of the Americas," said Christine Boyanoski, associate curator of Canadian historical art at the gallery.
Both the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto and the Art Gallery of Hamilton, about a half-hour drive southwest of Toronto, are getting exhibitions ready for this fall to give Canadians a better insight into the most popular holiday in Mexico. This is the Day of the Dead, Nov. 1, when families lay out food and drink and mementos for deceased loved ones.
The Mexican community in Canada is small, probably no more than 7,500, the Mexican Embassy estimates.
Maria Claudette Santillana, a 22-year-old exchange student from Oaxaca now living with a Toronto family and studying at Seneca College, offered perhaps one of the reasons when she observed: "Canada is a great place. But I don't like the winter."

HEADLINE: U.S. Aide Who Quit Calls Yugoslav Policy Ineffective

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
The State Department official who managed the United States' day-to-day policy toward the Balkans said today that he resigned in protest over what he called the Bush Administration's "ineffective" and "counterproductive" response to the fighting in the former Yugoslavia.
"What's going on in Bosnia is genocide, and the U.S. had a moral obligation to stop it," the former official, George D. Kenney, said in a telephone interview. "The Administration is not dealing seriously with the Yugoslav crisis. The things we've tried up to now haven't worked and we need to try some different approaches." 
 Mr. Kenney resigned from the Foreign Service on Tuesday. His departure and criticisms were first disclosed in The Washington Post today.
The former official, who is 35 years old, joined the Foreign Service in 1988 and had been acting chief of Yugoslav affairs for the last month, after having served as deputy chief since Jan. 31. He reported to policy makers, but was at the senior working level of the State Department bureaucracy.
Mr. Kenney said that "the risks of a Vietnam quagmire in Yugoslavia are vastly overblown" and that the United States and its Western allies should arm the poorly equipped Bosnians so they can reclaim territory lost to Serbian attacks. He also recommended air strikes against Serbian positions.
"In the short run, it would increase the violence, but in the long run it would decrease the violence," Mr. Kenney said. "It's more destabilizing to allow the Bosnians to be murdered."
 
Limits of U.S. Involvement
 President Bush has pledged American air support, if requested, to help deliver relief supplies to Bosnia and Herzegovina, but he has repeatedly ruled out punitive air strikes against Serbian targets or sending American ground forces to the region.
Mr. Kenney predicted that an international conference under way in London to discuss the Yugoslav crisis would most likely fail without strong pressure against the Serbs, including the threat of military action.
He charged that the Administration's Yugoslav policy lacked urgency. "It boils down to a cold, political calculation," he said. "The Administration decided that it's far away, Americans don't care about it, and it's too politically risky to get involved in."
In the interview, Mr. Kenney criticized senior Foreign Service officers for not challenging their superiors to take a more active role.
"After 12 years of the same kind of Republican administrations, the senior levels of the career officers have been so well trained in political obedience that no one wants to rock the boat," said Mr. Kenney, who said he last registered as a Republican.
There were indications that other career Foreign Service officers, including some middle-level officials above him, sympathized with Mr. Kenney.
 
Indications of Support
 "A lot of people share many of his views, particularly on the lack of action in response to this growing crisis," one State Department official said. "But many people also feel that it is naive to place the blame on career State Department officers who are carrying out the President's policy."
The State Department colleague said that Mr. Kenney, while not a Yugoslav expert by training, was hard-working and committed to improving the plight of the people caught in the civil war.
"He was trying to push for a more activist approach, and was more willing to contemplate U.S. engagement," said the American official, who added that Mr. Kenney was particularly concerned about famine and other hardships this winter.
The State Department issued a short statement today in response to Mr. Kenney's resignation, but did not address his policy criticism.
"We certainly understand his frustration in dealing with this crisis and the many horrors that have occurred in the former Yugoslavia," said a Department spokeswoman, Nancy Beck. "It's an enormously complex problem and one we've found through all of our efforts and those of the international community is not easily solved. We've been making strenuous efforts and will continue our efforts to try to stop the killing and try to help those in need."
At the conference in London today, senior State Department officials suggested that Mr. Kenney's resignation was a misplaced gesture. "If this is an expression of frustration, everybody is frustrated with it," an official said.

Bush Backs Duty-Free Trade
 WASHINGTON, Aug. 26 (Reuters) -- President Bush invoked his executive authority today and approved duty-free trade for all the former Yugoslav republics except Serbia and Montenegro. In light of "the Balkan nations' ongoing political and economic reforms, I have determined that it is appropriate," Mr. Bush told leaders of Congress.

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Soar in Tokyo; Nikkei Rises 1,013.35, or 6.1%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Aug. 27

 BODY:
Japanese stocks soared today in heavy trading, with the Nikkei index of 225 issues surging 1,013.35 points, or 6.1 percent, to close at 17,555.00.
Brokers said investors regained confidence in the market after the index broke through the 17,000-point level during the morning trading session. Many investors had regarded that level as a short-term ceiling. The Nikkei has not closed above 17,000 since July 15. 
 Brokers added that prices were surging in anticipation of the Japanese Government's stimulative economic package, which is due to be released on Friday.
Also, there was speculation in Tokyo's financial markets today that the Bank of Japan might cut the nation's discount rate as early as Friday, despite clear signals from the central bank that it had no intention of doing so.
An estimated 620 million shares were traded today, compared with 320 million on Wednesday.
"Investors are encouraged by the market's firmness as they have seen it move steadily during an adjustment period after recent big jumps," a broker at a big securities firm said. "Also, there is growing confidence about the Government's measures to boost the economy."
Brokers said investors expected the market to be firmer in September because the Government had asked financial institutions not to take quick profits in shares.
Stocks were also helped by broad buying by foreign and corporate investors, who were encouraged by Wednesday's advance on Wall Street.
On Wednesday, the Nikkei gained 160.88 points.
In the currency market here today, the dollar was higher against the yen, buoyed by renewed tensions in the Middle East. At midday, the dollar was trading 125.30 yen, up from 124.85 yen in New York on Wednesday.
The yield on 10-year Japanese Government bond fell to 4.630 percent in early trading today from 4.645 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: WARNING TO BAGHDAD;
Iraq Says It Is Ready to Fight Allies Over Air Zone

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Baghdad vowed today that it was ready to go to war again with the United States and its allies as they prepared to enforce a plan Thursday to take control of the skies over southern Iraq. But at the United Nations, Iraq's diplomats began a last-ditch effort to avoid a confrontation.
After the allies gave Iraq 24 hours' warning before they shoot down any Iraqi airplanes or helicopters flying south of the 32d parallel, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's representative, said he had asked the United Nations to send a multinational team of observers to the area.
 
'Wise Man's Committee'
 Mr. Anbari said Iraq had rejected outright the American-led plan for a what is called a "no fly" zone, delivered to him at the United Nations today by the United States, France, Britain and Russia.
But he asked the United Nations to establish what he called a "wise man's committee" composed of Arab representatives and members of the Security Council, to help "defuse the crisis as well as establish the truth as Iraq has been saying it."
The allies, who say the exclusion zone is necessary to protect Shiite Muslims in the south from Iraqi air assaults, are unlikely to accept the Iraqi suggestion since they had rejected earlier Iraqi proposals over the last week for legislators and others to visit Iraq and see that the Shiites are not being persecuted, as the allies argue.
 
Threat to Expel Aid Workers
 Earlier today, Iraq's public response to the exclusion zone was carried on the front page of Al Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Baath Party.
"Our great people and our valiant armed forces are fully prepared to confront the enemies," the newspaper said, calling the conflict with the United States-led alliance as a "holy war."
But the Iraqi response, the most recent in a stream of angry denunciations aimed at the United States and Britain in the last week, stopped short of saying that Baghdad would send its planes into action against allied forces.
United Nations officials said they feared that Iraq might also make good on a threat to expel United Nations guards protecting the organization's aid workers inside the country, if the United States and its Western partners attack Iraq. About 120 guards and 75 aid workers remain in the country.
Aid workers and guards have already been withdrawn from southern Iraq. A United Nations Children's Fund worker and eight guards returned to Baghdad from Basra on Monday after Iraqi officials warned they might become the target of demonstrations.
Even before it was officially announced, the allied plan has evoked a less-than-enthusiastic reaction in most Arab capitals.
Only Kuwait has said it backs the plan. Others, including major partners in last year's alliance that pushed Iraq out of Kuwait, have expressed either outright opposition or refused to take a stand.
Syria, which contributed troops to the coalition 18 months ago, declared itself flatly opposed to the plan, and officials in Egypt worried aloud that the no-fly zone would lead inevitably to the dismemberment of Iraq.
But in London, Dr. Laith Kubba, who is a Shiite and a member of the Iraqi National Congress, an opposition group based in London, described the announcement of the zone as "a courageous step."
But Dr. Kubba said the allies must be prepared to go beyond enforcing the ban on air operations in the zone, and be willing to take on Iraqi ground operations mounted against the Shiites. "That, after all, is the essence of U.N. Resolution 668 -- to stop indiscriminate attacks against the population, and halting the repression of minorities by the Iraqi Government," he said.
With the American warplanes ready to take to the air over southern Iraq on Thursday, the military situation facing Shiite Muslims remains unclear.
 
Iraqi Aircraft Go North
 The Pentagon reported on Tuesday that Iraq had removed its airplanes and most of its helicopters from the areas below the 32d parallel.
But Iraqi opposition groups based in London and Damascus said President Saddam Hussein was moving additional forces into the region, including two large Army units intended to reinforce what they called an "economic and military blockade" of the south.

The Economy
Durable goods orders plunged 3.4 percent in July, the sharpest drop of the year, eradicating economists' hopes that the economy could grow vigorously enough to spawn new jobs by year's end. Aircraft orders were weak. The report was viewed as most unwelcome for President Bush's re-election campaign. [Page D1.]
The Government waited far too long to investigate B.C.C.I., a report by a House subcommittee indicates. A number of Federal agencies received hundreds of tips over a decade, it says, that the bank was spending billions in financing illegal activities including fomenting unrest in Pakistan, smuggling arms in the Middle East and working with organized crime in the United States. [D1.]
 

International
A key to Japan's financial problems is its "nonbanks." These specialized lending companies poured huge sums into ill-considered real estate loans just before property prices plunged. Now the Government must restore confidence in the financial system. [D1.]
Growing doubts that Europe's economic-unification treaty will be approved in its present form roiled financial markets. The Bank of England intervened in foreign currency markets, helping stabilize the pound at 2.794 German marks. [D2.]
 
Companies
Hurricane Andrew was an ill wind that blew some good to building-supply companies, restaurants and sellers of furniture, appliances and household goods -- all businesses that will benefit as people rebuild. Economists even forecast jumps in employment and personal incomes once billions of dollars from insurance and Government aid begin arriving in the areas affected. [D3.]
The News Corporation continued its turnaround, with net income of $47.9 million in the fourth quarter in contrast to a loss of $348.9 million a year earlier. Its Fox network earned $45 million for the year, in contrast to losses at CBS and NBC. [D4.]
Toyota's operating profits dropped 63 percent to 124.86 billion yen, or about $1 billion, in its latest financial year. [D3.]
Mentor Graphics said it would eliminate 100 to 200 jobs and freeze salaries through 1993. [D3.]
Mellon Bank sued Bipin C. Shah, a former executive vice president, who left the bank in late July to form a new company that will compete with many of Mellon's businesses. [D3.]
 
Markets
Blue-chip stocks rose, underpinned by solid gains in Treasury bond prices and a calmer currency market. The Dow Jones industrial average tacked on 14.59 points to close at 3,246.81. [D8.]
Japanese stocks surged today, with the Nikkei index gaining 1,013.35 points, or 6.1 percent, to close at 17,555.00. [D1.]
The bond market rallied across the board, and the Treasury's five-year note auction went fairly well. [D14.]
The dollar continued its slight rebound against the mark, after plunging to lows earlier in the week, while gold prices fell. [D16.]
Sugar and cotton prices declined and energy prices stagnated as Hurricane Andrew's damaging effects on the Gulf Coast were offset by beneficial rain in previously dry areas. [D16.]
 
Today's Columns
Bonn's high, inflation-fighting interest rates have already drawn money out of dollar investments, and longer term, economists say, the strong mark could harm the economies of Britain, France and Italy as well. Peter Passell: Economic Scene. [D2.]
Goody's, a highly successful initial public offerings, owns 116 stores throughout the South that sell moderate-priced clothing. It has done stunningly well in a difficult retailing environment and reported record profits in its latest quarter. Market Place. [D8.]
Philip Morris is seeking more sales from less cigarette. It is spending heavily to promote a new 85-millimeter version of Benson & Hedges with sales of its 100-millimeter cigarette lagging. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D18.]

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Republicans Re-Think 'Family Values' Focus

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Having loosed some of the more ferocious dogs of political war to attack Bill Clinton and the Democrats on such intimate matters as God, family and the sort of woman Mr. Clinton married, officials of President Bush's campaign are now trying to change the subject -- or at least the tone of the discussion.
After the national convention's acidic assaults on the Democratic nominee, his wife and his party failed to restore Mr. Bush to parity with Mr. Clinton in public-opinion polls, Republican strategists are saying the economy, not "family values," is the central issue, and they are trying to distance Mr. Bush from some of the harsh words spoken on his behalf. 
 Charles Black, senior political adviser to the Bush campaign, said the campaign had no intention of dropping the subject of family values entirely, believing the collection of family, religious and social issues to be important to many swing voters in what is expected to be a close election.
 
Two-Step Tactic
 Instead, it seems clear, the Republicans will continue what has evolved as a two-step tactic that Democrats criticize as disingenuous, slashing at Mr. Clinton through the words of surrogates and, when backlash threatens, disavowing the troublesome remarks.
This approach was exhibited at elaborate length today not only by Mr. Black but by Mr. Bush.
Invited at a news conference to impugn Mr. Clinton's patriotism, Mr. Bush pointedly declined. And he suggested that the personal tone of the campaign was attributable to a handful of "hot shooters" on both sides -- a term he apparently coined on the spot and uttered with airy dismissal.
But he also signaled that he was not about to abandon a tactic Republicans have used to great effect in the past five Presidential elections. "I'm going to continue to talk about the values that I think are very, very important," Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Black, speaking to reporters today at a weekly breakfast familiar in Washington as a launching pad for trial balloons, repudiated remarks made last weekend by the House Minority Whip, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, to the effect that the family life of Woody Allen represented a sort of Democratic ideal.
Mr. Black said today that Mr. Gingrich "in no way was speaking for the President."
Mr. Black also dismissed a recent series of broadsides and barbs directed at Hillary Clinton by numerous Republican speakers.
Although the "family values" subject was raised in convention speeches by the President, Mrs. Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, Marilyn Quayle, the conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and William J. Bennett, the former Education Secretary, Mr. Black said his recollection was that most of the talk in Houston had been about the economy.
Mr. Black's remarks reflect a concern among White House and campaign officials, and among other Republican strategists and politicians, that the "family values" is both more troublesome and less profitable than had been thought.
 
Not Attracting Voters
 A White House official, speaking on the condition that he not be identified, said Mr. Bush's strategists have become concerned that the subject of family values, inherently personal and emotional, had led a number of convention speakers, including the President, to use language that could repel rather than attract voters.
"I don't think it's a fundamental backing off, but maybe a cooling down," said one White House official who spoke on the condition he not be identified.
In apparently seeking to distance the Bush campaign from the recent Republican criticisms of Mrs. Clinton that have received heavy, mostly unfavorable, attention, Mr. Black termed these remarks "a minor distraction."
"Look, we had 122 speakers at our convention last week and I think two of them referenced Mrs. Clinton," he said. "You can't do a convention like that without having some wild rumors, gossip, red herrings and other things distract from your main message."
Leading Republicans, however, including Mr. and Mrs. Bush and the chairman of the Republican Party, Richard N. Bond, talked prominently about Mrs. Clinton in various forums in Houston even if they did not mention the Democratic candidate's wife during their formal convention speeches. Mr. Black was asked if he had told the Bushes and Mr. Bond that he considered their comments inappropriate. He said he had.
 
G.O.P. Criticism
 Mr. Black's comments today come at a time when some Republicans outside the campaign are beginning to voice a distaste for the family values message.
"Some of us are getting pretty sick of this family values," said Tommy Hartnett, a Republican Senate candidate from South Carolina. "It was supposed to take a night at the convention. It's important, but so are other things."
"The message has to be about the economy," said the Republican consultant Michael Deaver. "We've got real day-to-day, life-and-death problems that are facing people every morning. You try to lecture them about family values and they're going to say, 'Don't tell me about God. Tell me about how I'm going to eat. Tell me about how I'm going to pay the rent.' "
Mr. Black said the Bush campaign would indeed focus its primary attention on the economy "even though the economy is bad and people are unhappy with the economic performance of this administration," and will devote a great deal of effort to portraying Mr. Bush as a President who would revive the economy through tax and spending cuts, while depicting Mr. Clinton as a devotee of higher taxes and more government spending.
Noting that while such issues as prayer in school, school choice, abortion and family-oriented welfare changes are issues that may not move the electorate as a mass, he said: "This is a game of margins. I don't think anybody believes this election is going to be won by a landslide."

HEADLINE: Dow Up 14.59, to 3,246.81, as Volume Falls

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Solid gains by Treasury bonds and a calmer currency market pushed blue-chip stocks higher yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 14.59 points, to 3,246.81.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 1,013 to 732 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume totaled 171.8 million shares, versus 201.6 million on Tuesday. 
 Despite the gains, some analysts were unconvinced about the market's direction, noting that political and economic uncertainties remain significant hurdles.
The 30-year bond was up 5/8, yielding 7.41 percent, down from 7.47 percent on Tuesday. A sale of five-year notes went smoothly, traders said.
Meanwhile, the dollar held near its opening levels, higher than Tuesday's close and above the record lows scored in recent days. It was trading at about 1.4065 German marks at the end of Wall Street's day, up from 1.4027 marks on Tuesday.
Politics weighed on the markets somewhat, with a new poll showing that President Bush's rise in popularity after the Republican convention had all but evaporated.
Bob Walberg of MMS International said that light bargain-hunting probably helped stocks to recover but that "the big problem is the economy, which remains stuck in neutral."
"Unless we see a definitive sign, the stock market will have a hard time rallying," he said, adding, "I don't think 3,200 will hold.
Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said investors were not yet pulling up stakes in the stock market. "There's no indication of major raising of cash," he said, adding, however, that sentiment had become more guarded.
Computervision topped the volume list, down 1 1/8, to 10 1/4, after Lehman Brothers crossed a block of 3.5 million shares.
Shares of Novell Inc. jumped 3 7/8, to 49 1/2, after Lehman upgraded the stock and other firms repeated their strong buy recommendations.
Dycom Industries, a telecommunications company, rose 1 3/4, to 6 3/4.
 Eli Lilly said a unit had suspended shipments of two of its angioplasty catheters. Its stock fell 1/2, to 66 1/2, but a rival catheter maker, Scimed Life, jumped 6 3/4, to 56 1/2. Shares of Merit Medical slumped 2 3/8, to 4 5/8.
Adobe Systems dropped 3 3/4, to 32 1/8. Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating to a hold from a buy.
 Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.90 points at 413.51. The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.13 point, to 379.65. The Nasdaq index rose 4.58 points, to 558.80.

HEADLINE: Test Scores Are Up Slightly For College-Bound Students

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26

 BODY:
College-bound high school seniors scored slightly higher on the Scholastic Aptitude Test this year than last, the first annual improvement for combined verbal and mathematics scores since 1985.
The average S.A.T. score this year was 423 on the verbal test and 476 on the math test, a total of 899 out of a possible 1,600 -- still far below the historic highs of the 1960's but 3 points higher than last year's combined total. 
 Educators said it was not clear whether the reversal signaled the end of a long downward trend that began in the 1960's. But they added that this year's scores appeared to be a real improvement, not a fluke of demographics.
 
Upward Trend?
 They noted that the number of students taking the test went slightly up along with the scores, from 1,032,685 in 1991 to 1,034,131 this year. As a rule, when the pool of test-takers grows to encompass more students from lower-income, less-educated families, the average score goes down.
"I'm encouraged by this year's results and hope they start an upward trend that puts the score declines of the 1980's behind us," said Donald M. Stewart, president of the College Board, which released the S.A.T. results today.
"One or two points may not seem like much, but each point is meaningful on a test taken by more than a million students who represent roughly two-thirds of all entering college freshmen," he said.
At the same time, Mr. Stewart and other educators said they were disturbed that rural and urban students continued to score lower than their counterparts from suburbs, medium-sized cities and small cities and towns. The average big-city scores were 411 on the verbal test and 465 on the math test, for a total of 876; rural scores were 414 on the verbal test and 459 on the math test, for 873; scores in other areas were 432 on the verbal test and 485 on the math test, for 917.
 
Students 'Left Behind'
 "Many students in rural and urban America are being left behind in a society that has few jobs for the undereducated and unskilled," Mr. Stewart said. "These are not just students who drop out of school, but also those heading for college."
And educators also expressed concern today that students' grades were rising faster than their S.A.T. scores. Though the overall grade average for those taking the test this year has risen to 3.12 on a 4-point scale, up from 3.07 in 1987, the combined S.A.T. score is 7 points lower.
The S.A.T., a two-and-a-half-hour multiple-choice test, is taken by high school students, most of whom plan to attend college, and measures verbal and mathematical ability. It is not intended to measure intelligence or the ability to learn.
This year's average score on the verbal test, 423, was up 1 point from 1991, reversing a decline that began in 1987. The average math score, 476, was up 2 points from last year and 10 points above the record low of 466 in 1980 and 1981.
Private-school students averaged the highest scores: 469 in verbal skills and 526 in math, for a total of 995. Students in religious schools averaged 439 in verbal skills and 474 in math, for a total of 913. The public-school averages were 420 in verbal skills and 475 in math, for a total of 895.
Foreign students taking the S.A.T. out-scored Americans in math by 57 points, averaging 533. Their average verbal score was 389.
Women's scores are historically lower than men's. This is attributed to the fact they more women who take the test come from lower-income and less-educated families. But female high school students overall have higher grade averages than their male counterparts. This year, women's scores rose 1 point on the verbal sections, to 418, and 3 on the mathematical sections, to 456, over last year's levels. Men's scores rose 2 points in verbal, 428, and 2 points in math, 499.
Since 1976, the average scores of black students rose 20 points on the verbal sections to 352, and 31 points on the math sections to 385. The average scores for whites fell nine points on verbal to 442 and two on math to 491.
The math scores of blacks and Puerto Ricans remained at 1991 levels, 385 for blacks and 406 for Puerto Ricans. In verbal, blacks were up 1 point to 352, and Puerto Ricans were up 5 to 366.
 
'Modestly Good News'
 The math average for American Indians increased 5 points over last year's results to 442, and verbal rose 2 points to 395. The math average for Asian-Americans was up two points to 532 and verbal was up 2 points to 413.
Mexican-Americans were the only ethnic group whose scores dropped from their 1991 performance. Their scores fell 5 points in verbal to 372 and 2 points in mathematics to 425.
Despite this year's gain in S.A.T. results, other educators cautioned against attributing the rise to any improvement in the quality of the nation's primary and secondary education.
"This is modestly good news," said Marc Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, a nonprofit policy and analysis organization based in Rochester. "But a difference of a point or two over one year and the next tells you very little about where American education is going.
The lower scores of rural and big-city students were of particular concern, and educators singled out family education and income as significant reasons for the differences. In rural and urban areas, those who take the S.A.T. come from families with income and education below the national average. Nationwide, 16 percent of those who take the S.A.T. report family incomes under $20,000; 24 percent in large cities and 19 percent in rural areas report such incomes.
In rural America, 85 percent of those who take the S.A.T. are white American citizens who speak English. Their average S.A.T. scores on the verbal and mathematics sections are 17 and 21 points below the respective national averages for whites. S.A.T. scores of most other rural ethnic groups are also below the national averages for their respective groups.
In big cities, half of those who take the S.A.T. are members of minorities, and 15 percent do not speak English as their primary language. Though only 5 percent of those taking the test reported having parents without a high school diploma, the highest percentages were among nonwhites.

12 PEOPLE WOUNDED AS GUNMEN OPEN FIRE
In what the police called one of the most violent shootouts in recent years, gunmen drove up to a Bronx apartment building and opened fire, wounding 12 people, many of whom crawled frantically for cover because they feared being shot again. The gunfire, which apparently stemmed from a dispute between drug dealers, touched off minutes of terror as residents poured from their buildings to look for friends and relatives among a tangle of bodies, victims and witnesses said.

SANDBLASTING HALTED AGAIN ON BRIDGE
After suspending maintenance on the Williamsburg Bridge amid complaints that sandblasting was spewing dust and paint chips with elevated levels of lead into Brooklyn, New York City's Transportation Department has allowed the work to resume this month -- on the Manhattan side of the bridge. The new work was halted after residents and elected officials on both sides of the East River expressed outrage that the department had allowed sandblasting on five occasions in Manhattan this month.

After nearly six weeks on the run, a 25-year-old Queens man surrendered himself to face charges that he shot and killed an off-duty Housing Authority police officer and another man after a brawl on a Bayside street. B3.
 
DINKINS GETS HIGH PRAISE
Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation who endorsed Mayor David N.

HEADLINE: Rohatyn, a Dinkins Critic on Budgets, Praises the Mayor

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, who has frequently criticized Mayor David N. Dinkins over his handling of New York City's severe budget problems, lavishly praised Mr. Dinkins yesterday for engineering a fiscal turnaround.
"The city has made a lot of progress," Mr. Rohatyn, who endorsed Mr. Dinkins in the 1989 mayoral race, said at a meeting of the assistance corporation in Manhattan yesterday. "We haven't hesitated to criticize the administration when we thought it was appropriate, and we shouldn't hesitate to praise the administration when it is appropiate." 
 Mr. Rohatyn's remarks came during a presentation of a report by the assistance corporation evaluating the city budget for the fiscal year that began on July 1, as well as how the city balanced the budget for the fiscal year that ended on June 30. Mr. Rohatyn was among the fiscal experts who foresaw great problems for the city as recently as the spring, but he said yesterday that the Mayor had stabilized New York's finances to an extent that would have been hard to anticipate six months ago.
He described the report as the corporation's most upbeat ever, and in marked contrast with its annual review last year. "We haven't put out a report like this, even in the heyday of the Koch administration," Mr. Rohatyn said.
 
'Commendable Success'
 The Municipal Assistance Corporation, better known as the M.A.C., was created 17 years ago to float bonds for the city to help stave off bankruptcy. The corporation's report contended that the Mayor had demonstrated "commendable success" in shepherding the city through a very difficult economy.
The Dinkins administration managed to balance the city's budget without raising taxes and by cutting $2 billion in costs, said the report, the latest in a series of reports from independent fiscal monitors in the last two months that have congratulated the administration for stabilizing the budget without resorting to fiscal gimmicks.
The report also noted some potential problems that the city still faces, as have the previous reports. Chief among them, it said, is the lack of progress in contract negotiations with the unions representing city workers.
The contracts of all of the municipal workers' unions have expired, and negotiations that began in early June have not yet produced any substantial breakthroughs. The Dinkins administration contends that it will grant only wage increases that are financed through productivity gains.
"Despite the importance of these negotiations, however, progress to date has been disappointing," the report said. "More significant, leadership from the city as to what it seeks in concessions to meet its goals has not been evident."
 
'Our Work Is Not Done'
 Philip R. Michael, the city's Budget Director, said the administration recognized the significance of the labor talks. "I think we know, particularly with labor, that our work is not done," Mr. Michael said.
Mr. Michael also said the city could not obtain any productivity savings without the agreement of labor leaders. "You can lead, but both sides have to agree," he said.
The remarks by Mr. Rohatyn and other M.A.C. board members represented a marked shift from their tough criticism of the Dinkins administration over the last two years. "We feel much more confident in the city's ability to pre-act rather than react," said Mr. Rohatyn.
 
Money From Surplus
 Mr. Rohatyn indicated that the praise would not affect the outcome of a longstanding debate over how $200 million in M.A.C. surplus money would be spent. Mr. Dinkins would like to use the money as part of a labor settlement, while City Board of Education officials want the money for the city's schools.
Mr. Rohatyn has long insisted that both the Mayor and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo would have to agree on any plan for the money. He suggested yesterday that it might be used to pay directly for construction that would ordinarily be financed through bonds.
Asked late yesterday if his comments suggested that he would endorse Mr. Dinkins for re-election next year, Mr. Rohatyn said he had always tried rigorously to separate his political endorsements from his official activities as chairman of the assistance corporation.
"I am fully alive to the fact that this may be beneficial to the Mayor," Mr. Rohatyn said.

Suppliers Shipping Extra Goods to Storm Areas

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Aug. 26

 BODY:
Retailers and building-supply companies today scrambled to meet surging demand for their goods after Hurricane Andrew battered South Florida and the Louisiana coast.
Some economists predicted that a rebuilding boom in those areas could last as much as a year, giving a modest spurt to employment and personal incomes once billions of dollars from private insurers and the Federal Government begin arriving. 
 Restaurants and retailers of furniture, appliances and other household goods will also see a surge in business, said Rosalind Greenstein, senior economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, in Lexington, Mass. But many small businesses that had struggled for more than two years in a weak economy are likely to fail now, she added.
 
Increased Shipments
 Executives at Home Depot Inc., the Atlanta-based discount retailer of hardware and building materials, said they were shipping thousands of extra supplies to their operations in South Florida, which included 18 stores before Hurricane Andrew struck early Monday. Thirteen stores are open and another four will reopen within three weeks, the company said, but another will take six months to rebuild.
"We are moving massive amounts of lumber, building materials and emergency-type supplies from our stores and distribution centers across the country into both South Florida and Louisiana," said Lonnie Fogel, a Home Depot spokesman. "This is an around-the-clock effort. Hundreds of truckloads have arrived into those markets and are en route."
Plywood, plastic sheeting, tarpaulins, nails, hammers and other hand tools are of particular need in South Florida to make immediate repairs of exposed sections of houses and other buildings.
Bruce Berg, president of Home Depot's Southeast division, in Tampa, said that wholesale lumber prices had soared by nearly 40 percent in the region in the last week but that for now, the company had not raised its retail prices and was losing money on those products.
"We cannot afford to lose large amounts of money forever," he said, "and we may have to rethink our policy."
Mr. Fogel said Home Depot had urged many of its suppliers, like makers of portable electric generators, to accelerate production to meet needs in the hurricane areas. That should prompt new hiring at some suppliers, he said, "because ultimately, factories will be cranking up."
Yet some construction suppliers were operating at full capacity before Andrew struck this week. Half the plywood mills in the Pacific Northwest were shut this summer after a Federal court banned logging in the spotted owl's wooded habitat there, said Sheila Weidman, a spokeswoman for the Georgia-Pacific Corporation. This put burdens on the remaining mills to meet normal demand.
"There is no additional capacity in the industry to meet the tremendous need that's been created by the hurricane," she said. For its part, Georgia Pacific has altered its product mix, making more plywood sheeting for roofing and construction and fewer finished siding products, she said.
"We're making every effort to divert materials to the hurricane-damaged areas," she said. Georgia-Pacific shipped 30 rail cars filled with plywood, at 3,024 sheets a rail car, to South Florida on Monday.
 
Lessons From Hugo
 The lessons in 1989 from Hurricane Hugo suggest that new jobless claims in the storm-ravaged areas will soar during the next four weeks, and then recede as programs for rebuilding and repair begin.
In South Carolina, personal income plunged 24 percent in the third quarter of 1989 after Hurricane Hugo devastated the state in September. Incomes rebounded to a gain of 36 percent in the next quarter after disaster aid and insurance money flowed into the state.
"Income grew a lot faster than it did in other parts of the country," said Daniel Friel, economist at Nationsbank in Charlotte, N.C. A similar pattern is likely in South Florida and Louisiana, and could give a spark to local economies in the storm-ravaged regions.
"In the Miami area, construction had been very hard hit, with employment falling sharply in the last year," he said. "It looks to us like the national economy will do better at some point next year. So this might be a good bridge" for South Florida "between now and when the national economy picks up."
In Louisiana, thousands of homes and small businesses were destroyed or scarred by the storm, and electric power was disrupted in several towns that serve as staging areas for the offshore drilling industry. These towns include Morgan City, New Iberia and Lafayette.
"A lot of the offshore industry's operating offices, fabrication yards and storage sites are located where the hurricane devastated things," said J. Rogers Pearcy, director of the Minerals Management Service's Gulf of Mexico region, in New Orleans.
In the financial markets, traders were unsure how to gauge the storm's effects. At the New York Mercantile Exchange today, crude oil for delivery in October rose 6 cents a barrel, to $21.21, and September unleaded gasoline rose 0.09 cent, to 62.22 cents a gallon. But September heating oil declined 0.11 cent, to 58.12 cents a gallon, and October natural gas settled at $1.882 for 1,000 cubic feet, off 4.7 cents.
"If anything had been damaged, we would know by now," said Peter Beutel, director of energy research at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. "Bad news travels fast. We believe the market is heading lower in the next few days."

HEADLINE: Durables Orders Fell 3.4% in July

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Orders for cars, aircraft, industrial equipment and other durable goods suffered the year's sharpest decline last month, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The report removed any lingering hope among economists that the economy could grow fast enough to reduce unemployment by the end of the year. 
 July's 3.4 percent decline in orders was much worse than the flat performance most economists had expected. Those inclined to shrug rather than scowl pointed out that an especially large drop in aircraft orders, always a volatile category, was chiefly responsible.
Yet a 1.4 percent drop in unfilled orders -- the 11th straight decline, leaving the lowest backlog since February 1989 -- told others that factories will be running well below capacity for many more months.
 
A 'Barely Creeping' Economy
 "The fundamental point is that the economy is just barely creeping forward," said Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. "There's no good news for the White House in this."
Though volatile, the durable-goods figures are regarded as a strong signal of things to come. The Presidential election might well turn on the economic outlook. And that outlook has remained dark amid reports that consumers continue to lose confidence, with the economy's second-quarter growth rate of 1.4 percent well below the 2 percent level needed to reduce joblessness.
Bond prices rose after the durable-goods report, as they usually do after signs of slow growth. The bond market rally and a stabilizing in the value of the dollar fed a nearly 15-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average.
 
Glimmers of Hope Dashed
 A few glimmers of renewed business confidence, reflected in some surveys and stronger second-quarter earnings, had suggested that corporations might pull the economy along. The durable-goods figures indicated, however, that businesses, too, are remaining cautious. New orders for industrial machinery and equipment fell 1.8 percent; and for nonmilitary capital goods, 7 percent.
"Capital spending is not going much of anywhere," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities. "They took away the silver lining. I never thought we could get the economy to grow more than 2 or 2.5 percent. Now the question becomes whether we're going to 1 percent."
July's decline in durable-goods orders, to a seasonally adjusted $119 billion, continues a choppy pattern, with a rise of 2.8 percent in June and a drop of 2.1 percent in May. Last month's decline was the largest since a 5.3 percent drop in December.
 
'A Subdued Economy'
 The worst major category was transportation equipment, down 15.2 percent. Most of the decline came in aircraft and parts, saying to some economists that weak economies abroad are hurting the nation's exports. Military orders, overlapping with transportation, fell 26.4 percent.
Without transportation, new orders rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, almost enough to keep up with inflation in an area where prices have been fairly stable.
David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial, was among those who said that this figure, excluding transportation, gives a better picture of the economy's prospects. "It's not a good number, but it's not terrible," he said. He expects slow, 2 percent, economic growth well into next year -- "a subdued economy, no doubt about it."
Orders for durable goods, expensive items meant to last at least three years, indicate whether consumers and businesses are willing to make major purchases, which often require borrowing.
Durable-goods components contribute to the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators, due out next Tuesday. William C. Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, expects the index to rise just one-tenth of 1 percent.

Bonds Rally as Dollar Stabilizes

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market put together a decent rally yesterday after the dollar stabilized, a key economic barometer confirmed that the economy was barely growing and the Treasury's five-year note auction went fairly well.
The rise in prices and drop in yields was across the board, from three-month bills to the 30-year bond. The move started slowly in the morning, gained as the report on durable goods was released and then moved on as it seemed clear that the dollar would hold its own for a day. 
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7.25 percent 30-year bond was offered at 98 in late trading, up 5/8, to yield 7.41 percent, compared with 7.47 percent Tuesday. The 6.375 percent 10-year bond was up 21/32, to yield 6.63 percent, compared with 6.72 percent the day before. The 4.25 percent two-year note that had a mediocre auction Tuesday rebounded yesterday. It was up 5/32 to yield 4.25 percent, compared with the 4.30 percent average yield in the auction and the 4.34 percent it was trading at after the Tuesday auction.
 
Presidential Election Uncertainty
 No one knows how long the dollar calm will last. Many currency analysts think the sluggish American economy, the uncertainty about the Presidential election and much higher interest rates in Europe will continue to push the dollar lower.
It is still hard to gauge how effective the coordinated central bank intervention, led by the Federal Reserve, has been and will be in slowing the dollar decline. In the last two days, the central banks have not intervened to buy dollars and the dollar has not declined. When they intervened last Friday the dollar fell 1 percent and when they bought dollars again on Monday the American currency fell 2 percent.
"It could turn around quickly," said John Costas, managing director of government trading and sales at the First Boston Corporation. "We will be as finicky as the dollar in the next couple of weeks."
It is possible that if the decline is slow, the fundamental forces that are supporting the bond market -- low inflation and slow economic growth - will prevail again. But no one seems willing to make that bet now.
The price rally yesterday, however, was not as much as might have been expected given that the durable goods report showed an unexpectedly sharp decline in July. The fall of 3.4 percent in orders was the steepest in six months and way beyond market forecasts, which ranged from up a little to down a little. Durable goods rose a revised 2.8 percent in June.
In addition, the level of orders on the books fell for the 11th straight month. Many economists say this decline means that it will be some time before manufacturing companies begin hiring additional workers, another factor that means economic growth will continue to be sluggish.
But traders said that the weakness of the dollar means that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to ease interest rates in the near future, even if the economic data continue to be weak. For investors, therefore, there is less of a chance that short-term interest rates will move lower soon, which would give the bond market another reason to rally. And so the durable goods report gave the market less of a boost than it might have a month ago.
"The Federal Reserve has been neutralized as a market factor by the dollar," said Joseph Liro, the newly appointed chief economist at S. G. Warburg & Company in New York. "The Fed will not tighten to defend the dollar. And they can not ease because the dollar is too weak."
 
Treasury 5-Year Note Sale
 The Treasury auction of $10.6 billion in five-year notes went well, in part because the decline in bond market prices in the last several days had increased the coupon and the yield on the new note and made it much more attractive. Bond and note prices move in the opposite direciton of yields.
The average yield at the auction was 5.74 percent, which is far above the 5.56 percent a month ago, which is a reflection of the damage the falling dollar did to the bond market. The yield is even farther above the 5.46 percent the note was trading at in the pre-auction or when issued market late last week.
But the combination of a 5.625 percent coupon and a lot of cash that had been sitting on the sidelines for several days while the dollar was falling made for some decent demand, traders said. And that was also reflected in the trading after the auction results were announced. Late yesterday, the yield on the new-five year note had fallen to 5.67 percent, which means that the demand had drivien its price higher.
Mr. Costas of First Boston also said that the market was helped over all yesterday by some good buying from pension and other funds in the United States and from foreigners, who also had been sitting out the last several days. He said the combination of a stable -- but very weak -- dollar and the recent decline in bond and note prices made the American market especially attractive to foreign investors.

Taxable Fund Yields Are Off, While Tax-Exempts Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by money market funds were mixed in the latest week as the supply of municipal debt increased and the weak dollar made an impact in short-term rates, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report.
While yields on taxable funds slipped, the seven-day averages for the compounded yield and simple yield for tax-exempt funds both rose by 4 basis points, to 2.21 percent and 2.19 percent, respectively. For the 30-day average, the compound and simple yields are 2.19 percent and 2.17 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. 
 Assets of tax-exempt money funds showed a small inflow of cash to the funds in the current week, as assets grew by $73 million, to $96.3 billion.
Walter S. Frank, IBC/Donoghue's chief economist, noted that the municipal market now had a heavy supply of refunding issues and would probably see more yet, as municipalities come back to the debt market with new issues at the beginning of a new fiscal year.
"Insurance companies could also boost the supply of municipals for sale and drive yields higher," Mr. Frank said, "if in the wake of Hurricane Andrew's storm damage and their need to raise cash in order to make good on policies, they sell off some of their municipal bond holdings."
The average number of days left to maturity of tax-exempt securities held in fund portfolios remained unchanged at 64.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-free yield is 3.06 percent, while the equivalent for investors in the 31 percent tax bracket is 3.20 percent.
In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, IBC/Donoghue's said the Strong Municipal Money Market funds ran its streak as the best-performing fund to 10 consecutive weeks, with a return of 2.97 percent. The fund's distributor is Strong/Corneliuson of Milwaukee.
 
Taxable Fund Yield: 3.107%
 Meanwhile, yields in taxable money market funds slipped, as assets jumped by $6.6 billion, to a total of $505.7 billion. The growth came from institutions fleeing to their traditional parking place in money market funds. A weak dollar has hurt both the bond and stock markets.
Analysts also took note that part of the $7.1 billion increase in institutional assets, to $184.5 billion, was the result of two funds moving over from the retail category.
The average seven-day compounded yield for taxable money market funds was 3.07 percent, down 3 basis points, with the simple yield down 2 basis points, to 3.02 percent. For the 30-day average, the compounded and simple yields are both down 3 basis points, to 3.12 percent and 3.07 percent, respectively.
Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in portfolios fell by one, to 63, though that was still the longest period to maturity in 10 years.
The Standby Reserve Fund, distributed by Cowen & Company in New York, had the best return among general purpose funds, with a yield of 3.84 percent, as it maintained its top spot for the fourth straight week.
By comparison, the average bank money market account slipped only one basis point this week, to yield 3.02 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest rate publication in North Palm Beach, Fla.

HEADLINE: Altered Riverside South Plan Wins Messinger Over

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
To win approval for his Riverside South development project from Borough President Ruth W. Messinger, Donald J. Trump agreed yesterday to contribute $5 million to the renovation of the 72d Street IRT subway station, set aside at least 10 percent of the apartments for subsidized housing and insure there would be no net increase of sewage to the North River treatment plant in Harlem.
He also agreed to pay half the annual maintenance for a public park that is to be built along the Hudson River as part of the project. 
 With these and other guarantees in hand after a 36-hour session that capped weeks of negotiations, Ms. Messinger announced her support for the enormous project, which is to rise over the abandoned rail yards from 59th to 72d Street in Manhattan.
In her years as a Councilwoman from the Upper West Side, Ms. Messinger was not known as a developer's friend. So her approval, while advisory, may add considerable political luster to the Trump proposal, which goes next to the New York City Planning Commission for review.
Indeed, she said last month that she would not support Riverside South in the form in which it had been considered by Community Board 7. The board, whose position is also advisory, turned down the project 35 to 1 after a series of hearings in which sentiment leaned against it.
The basic scope of Riverside South remains unchanged -- 16 apartment buildings with some 5,700 units, a 2.1 million-square-foot office and studio building and a 21.5-acre park. But Ms. Messinger said there had been "progress on almost all fronts" in talks with the Riverside South Planning Corporation, which is headed by Richard A. Kahan and financed by Mr. Trump.
And yesterday, Ms. Messinger described Riverside South as a "project that has enormous potential for breathing new life into our city."
In turn, Mr. Kahan said her decision would send a "powerful signal that there's a new way of doing business in New York City."
She signed an agreement yesterday with Mr. Kahan and Mr. Trump. The agreement recognizes the "poor condition" of the chronically overcrowded subway station stop at 72d and Broadway and the "additional riders the project will add to this station." Given this, the developer would contribute $5 million to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for rehabilitating the station, provided that the authority is committed to financing the balance.
If government subsidies are available to finance such construction, the developer would set aside at least 20 percent of the apartments as "affordable housing for persons of low, moderate and middle income." Absent such subsidies, the developer would subsidize 10 percent of the units out of proceeds from the project.
To prevent an increase in the overall flow of sewage to the North River sewage treatment plant in view of its operational flaws and uncertainty over its capacity, the developer would either build a sewage treatment plant on site or help finance the installation of low-flow plumbing fixtures in existing buildings in the area served by the plant.
 
Meeting Demand
 After December 1994, the developer would be able to hook up to the North River plant if the chairman of the City Planning Commission certified in writing that the plant "has sufficient capacity to meet the project's demand and the demand of all other affordable housing projects," as described in the city's 10-year capital plan, in the area served by the plant.
The developer would build a temporary park on the site "as soon as possible" after the renovation of the elevated section of the West Side Highway, whose course is eventually to be shifted inland to accommodate the permanent park. The developer would also contribute at least half the annual maintenance cost of the permanent park.

Toyota Posts 63% Decline In Yearly Net

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 26

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's largest car maker, today reported a 63 percent drop in operating profits for its latest financial year, citing weak demand for cars and a strong Japanese yen.
The company said its operating profit tumbled to 124.86 billion yen, or about $1 billion, for the year ended June 30, while current profit slumped 34.6 percent, to 375.86 billion yen, or about $3.03 billion. 
 In Japan, operating profits are pretax earnings that include special profits and losses; they are considered the best indicator of business health. Current profits are also pretax earnings but include gains and losses on investments in stocks and bonds and results from other nonoperating activities.
 
Expects to Maintain Profits
 "Slow car demand will fuel competition, and there are unpredictable factors such as currency rates and overseas demand," Toyota's vice president, Tatsuro Toyoda, said at a news conference. "But we expect we can maintain profits at previous-year levels."
Auto industry analysts said the drop in earnings was expected because of the slower demand for cars in Japan's slack economy. They added that Toyota's foreign exchange losses were larger than expected.
"The yen was very strong against both U.S. and European currencies," Mr. Toyoda said. "Put together, that had quite a severe impact on our profits."
Toyota hopes the Government's measures to stimulate Japan's economy will lead to a mild rebound in the demand for vehicles.
For the year ending June 30, 1993, the company forecast sales of about 9.4 trillion yen, or about $75.8 billion, up about 5 percent from the 8.94 trillion yen, or about $72 billion, for the year recently ended. But analysts say Toyota may be too optimistic about recovery in auto market.
"If they're basing their estimates on strong recovery in Japan and the U.S., they're in for an unpleasant surprise," said Mike Morizumi, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.
"Toyota's boosting market share in the U.S. and that's a plus, but they can't hope for very substantial improvement unless the domestic market turns around," said Masayuki Mochizuki, an analyst with W. I. Carr (Overseas) Ltd.
Toyota's profit growth in the current fiscal year will be flat at best, and even that target may be difficult to hit, analysts said.
The company will try to maintain profits by cutting costs and making more marketing efforts, Mr. Toyoda said. "And we must achieve our sales goal for this year," he added. "No matter what."

Dollar Continues Rebound, Trading in a Narrow Range

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar continued to rebound slightly yesterday from all-time lows against the German mark and rose against other currencies. Gold prices fell.
"The dollar is staking a base around 1.4000 marks but we're still uncertain because that's near its new low," said Ziggy Zborowski, a trader at the Bank Leumi Trust Company. 
 The dollar closed at 1.4065 marks in New York, up from the 1.4027 on Tuesday and from its low close of 1.4015 marks it reached Monday. The dollar was quoted in late European trading at 1.4070 marks, up from 1.4020 late Tuesday.
Traders said the dollar moved in a narrow range, partly on speculation about a realignment of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, which links the currencies of most governments in the European Community.
Reports that a member of Germany's central bank supported a realignment lifted the mark temporarily. Later, the Bundesbank clarified that the official was only restating policy that realignment was possible, rather than advocating it. The statement pulled the mark back down.
John McCarthy, chief currency dealer at ABN-AMRO Bank in New York, said traders had been mildly disappointed by news that orders to American factories for durable goods fell 3.4 percent in July. "But the good sign was that the dollar still held up fairly well under that pressure," Mr. McCarthy said.
In New York, the dollar closed at 124.85 Japanese yen, up from 124.55 on Tuesday. Earlier in London, the dollar was quoted at 124.95 yen. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 124.95 yen, up 0.10 yen.
In New York, the British pound closed at $1.9860, down from $1.9895 on Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.2580 Swiss francs, up from 1.2475; 4.7950 French francs, up from 4.7825; 1,074.75 Italian lire, up from 1,071.00, and 1.19175 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18985.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.2590 Swiss francs, up from 1.2475; 4.7965 French francs, up from 4.7815; 1.5855 Dutch guilders, up from 1.5804; 1,074.25 Italian lire, up from 1,070.50, and 1.1907 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1889.
Gold prices fell worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $338.30 an ounce, down from $340.60 on Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold fell to a late bid price of $338.15 an ounce, off $2.35.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $338.35, from $341.65 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $338.75, from $341.65 late Tuesday.
On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $3.669 an ounce, down from $3.70 Tuesday.

Bonn Punches, The Dollar Rolls

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THOSE looking to put the best face on the falling dollar need not look far: Cheaper greenbacks mean more exports, which in turn means more jobs for an economy in need of same.
And in this case, the best face is not a bad face at all. For one thing, the theory is on target. While the kick will not come soon -- certainly not before the election -- bargain dollars should eventually make everything from Boeing's jets to Frank Perdue's chickens more competitive abroad. 
 For another, the choices are limited. With German money markets paying close to 10 percent interest, the flight from dollars could not be easily reversed without significant help from the German central bank. And in the view of Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Public Policy, the inflation-busters at the Bundesbank would be "the last people on earth to listen" to Washington's pleas for easier money.
Nonetheless, few economists seem inclined to relax and enjoy the show. If the retreat from dollars turns into a rout, they say, the feeble economic recovery would be trampled underfoot. Even if it does not, the dollar-mark realignment could undo the best-laid plans for European monetary union and liberalized world trade.
Just why the dollar chose this month to head south is anyone's guess. C. Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics points to George Bush's failure to outline a credible attack on the budget deficit and, more generally, to "growing doubts that the U.S. is going to get its economic act together."
But the current lure of German currency is hardly a mystery. With American banks paying less than 4 percent interest and their counterparts in Frankfurt paying more than 9 percent, investors who are otherwise inclined to hold cash in dollars are buying marks.
This rush from the dollar, notes Richard Cooper of Harvard, is self-limiting: at some depressed exchange rate, the extra five percentage points of interest in marks will not compensate investors for the risk that the dollar will bounce back. But Mr. Cooper does not claim to know where the buck will stop. And like most economists, he doubts the capacity of governments to manage exchange rates by direct intervention in the $1-trillion-a-day foreign exchange market.
For most Americans, a modest further decline in the dollar could prove a nonevent. The initial impact, argues Mr. Lawrence, is like a tax, as higher prices for imported goods erode Americans' purchasing power. Later, it should stimulate sales, as American goods become more attractive both at home and abroad. But the overall impact is likely to be lost in the tides of changing domestic demand.
Georges de Menil, senior editor of the European-based journal Economic Policy, emphasizes the positive: the system works. The whole point of floating exchange rates, he argues, is to let the big economies pursue diverging priorities -- in this case American recession-fighting versus German inflation-fighting -- without forcing confrontation.
The real risk, economists agree, is that the walk away from the dollar will turn into a run. Panic selling of dollar-denominated securities would devastate Wall Street. And it could drive the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates, tumbling Main Street back into recession.
Most economists regard this as very unlikely, as long as governments lean against the speculative winds by purchasing dollars at appropriate moments. Most, but not all, that is. "If I were James Baker," Mr. Bergsten said, "I'd be terrified."
What does worry many Europe-watchers, though, is the fallout on European Community politics.
Under the deal tentatively struck at Maastricht in December, Europe would eventually become a single economy with a single currency. But Germany's current take-no-prisoners effort to contain domestic inflation with tight money, while paying much of the bill for German unification with capital borrowed from abroad, is stiffening the resistance to the currency union from other members of the community.
Mr. Lawrence notes that high interest rates and appreciating exchange rates against the dollar, both courtesy of the Bundesbank, threaten the recovery of recession-mired Britain. And they could push the sputtering Italian and French economies over the edge. The timing could hardly be worse: France has scheduled a referendum on Maastricht for Sept. 20.
Another consequence of the dollar-mark shuffle could affect Americans more directly. The White House has been counting on German manufacturers to neutralize the influence of protectionist-minded European farmers manning the barricades against global trade liberalization. But Mr. Cooper notes that German industry's interest in open trade -- and for that matter, the rest of Europe's -- declines as currency appreciation makes its products less competitive abroad.
The almighty dollar may be a symbol whose time has gone. But the pain of adjustment, alas, goes deeper than $200 restaurant meals in Paris.

N.H.L. Meeting Instigated Little

BYLINE: By Joe Lapointe

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG BEACH, Fla.

 BODY:
This just in from the Gulf Coast, where National Hockey League owners have concluded their summer meetings: Helmets are now optional, and so is common sense . . . ice barons survive brainstorms in tropical hurricane zone . . . they came, they argued, they compromised . . . it's not the heat, it's the stupidity.
They could have done so much more. For the first time, owners seriously considered a rule that would have mandated the ejection of fistfighters. This would have eliminated the jobs of three dozen full-time goons whose only major league skill is to punch people's noses while standing on ice skates. 
 Almost half the teams were that dovish. But the hawks, led by the Edmonton Oilers, stopped the abolitionists' momentum by proposing a face-saving compromise that really changes little. The new rule says that only "instigators" of fights will be ejected. Last season, when instigators got only an extra two minutes, only 26 percent of the fights included an instigator penalty. With the new rule so much harsher, will referees see even that many instigators?
Pat Quinn, the president of the Vancouver Canucks, put it best. "The spontaneous fight was the only thing I was trying to protect," he said.
In this context, spontaneous is a euphemism. Precious few fights, maybe 1 in 10, are really spontaneous exchanges that flare suddenly from hard contact. What Quinn and his faction protected is the calculated, consensual fist fight between two willing participants.
Most hockey followers can predict these "spontaneous" fights weeks in advance. If, for instance, the Rangers play Detroit, Tie Domi and Bob Probert will probably have another "spontaneous" fight. These sideshows usually make the evening newscasts and give hockey's image a black eye. But they also sell tickets, at least according to some hockey executives, who have better sense than to say such a thing on the record.
Another privately-spoken fear is that elimination of goons could change the nationalist makeup of the sport. Most fighting specialists are English-speaking Canadians trained in the junior leagues of western Canada and Ontario. If those three dozen jobs were to open up, many would be filled by the skilled players of Europe, who are joining the league at a rapid rate, especially since the fall of the Soviet bloc.
Most N.H.L. executives come from Canada's junior leagues. They don't mind strip-mining the former Iron Curtain countries for stars like Jaromir Jagr, Pavel Bure and Sergei Fedorov, but they keep the peace at home if middle and low-level jobs are filled by home-boy hooligans who consider even Quebec to be foreign soil.
When they get pious, the executives like to declare "fighting isn't the big problem, it's the stick work." This was heard often at poolside over the weekend. So how will they curb these dangerous fouls? Mostly by changing one rule slightly, on an experimental basis, for the exhibition season. In layman's terms, you now can't hit a player above the waist with your stick. It used to be, you couldn't hit him above the shoulders. And, if you must break Mario Lemieux's hand with an unprovoked slash, try not to make it so obvious.
The most curious rule change is the one about helmets. Since 1979, any player joining the league had to wear one. Now, the helmet is optional. To critics, this is like telling motorists that seatbelts are optional.
But the pro-choice faction offers two arguments. One is that players without helmets are treated with more respect. If your face and head are bare, the theory goes, an opponent will be less likely to hit you there with a stick because the risks to you (and the possible punishments to him) are greater. The marketing part of the argument is that players whose faces and hairstyles are easier to see will become more familiar to fans who attend the games and watch on television. Familiarity, so that theory goes, breeds commerce.
This leads to Gil Stein, the interim president of the league, who replaced purge victim John Ziegler this summer, and is attempting to pursue a progressive agenda with aggressive methods.
Ziegler avoided television exposure; the Stein administration seeks it, and hopes to get a game-of-the-week contract from ESPN this season. Ziegler avoided confronting the goon issue; Stein forced a debate and almost forced a vote. Ziegler dragged his tassle-loafered feet on the possibilities of Olympic participation; Stein is pushing for it.
When owners appointed Stein, they expected a caretaker presidency. Stein, figuring his days were numbered anyway, is campaigning for the full-time job of commissioner. His chances are probably those of a snowball in Florida, for several reasons. He's a holdover from the Ziegler administration, he's an American, he's over 60 years old and he's willing to break eggs to make an omlette, as he showed by forcing the resignation of Brian O'Neill, the executive vice president, who is a respected member of the old boys' club that runs the league.
Asked about his chances, Stein said he's been getting plenty of positive feedback, although he added that he's not naive enough to think that this assures him of anything. Asked about other candidates, he made a weak joke about Fay Vincent, the baseball commissioner, possibly looking for work. Perhaps in a few months, they will both vie for places on the unemployment line.

Saving Few Dollars Doesn't Make Sense

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Just when the Yankees are learning that their minor league system is capable of producing players talented enough to play in the major leagues, they are cutting back on the operation that has led to that discovery.
Just when rookies like Sam Militello, Andy Stankiewicz and Bob Wickman have provided a fresh look for a stale old team, the Yankees have decided not to have a team in the fall instructional league this year. This was an economic decision, one that should save them about $125,000, maybe a few thousand more. That sum will go a long way this winter toward signing Barry Bonds or Ruben Sierra or Greg Maddux or David Cone. 
 When George Steinbrenner, the absentee owner, began his reign in New York, one of his first acts was to slash the size of the Yankees' scouting staff. The Yankees, he concluded, were spending a lot of money unnecssarily on people who didn't add much to the organization.
To Steinbrenner's credit, though, he learned that he had made a mistake, and he rectified it, restoring the scouting staff to a size commensurate with the goals of an organization that wanted to win.
The Yankees are among seven teams that won't have an instructional league team this fall. Some organizations, like the San Francisco Giants and the Milwaukee Brewers, will have minicamps for minor leaguers instead next February, just before spring training.
A Yankees' minicamp is a possibility. At least the idea has been raised. "It's waiting to be budgeted. It's part of the 1993 budget," Brian Sabean, the vice president for player development and scouting, said yesterday.
Pre-spring training minicamps run about three weeks; the instructional league lasts six weeks. Depending on an organization's willingness to spend money, it could invite 30 players or it could invite 60 to attend the instructional league. One fall not long ago, the Yankees had two teams in the Florida section of the league. The Los Angeles Dodgers plan to have two teams in Arizona this year.
Why won't the Yankees have any teams?
"It was handed down from the partnership, and I take orders from headquarters," Sabean said. "They give me the money, and I try to make the programs work with the money I get."
The purpose of the instructional league is precisely what the name implies. Young players receive instruction in a more concentrated and more individualized way than is available during a minor league season.
Militello, the 22-year-old pitcher who has caused a sensation in four starts with the Yankees, spent the past two falls in the instructional league.
"The first year I worked on developing a changeup," Militello said yesterday. "Last year I pulled a hamstring and got to pitch in only four innings, but I still worked on the changegeup again. I worked on becoming more consistent with it. I also worked on my stretch delivery, holding runners on. It definitely helped."
When pitchers pitch in instructional league games, they do not worry about hits and runs or victories and defeats. They are there to work on specific elements of their pitching, so they likely will throw a changeup, if that is what they are developing, instead of the fastball they would go to if it were a game that counted.
Jerry Nielsen went to the instructional league in 1989. He had spent the first two years in the organization as a reliever, but since the Yankees wanted him to become a starting pitcher, he needed more innings of work to build up his arm. He went back the next year for half the instructional season, then went the whole way last fall.
"Last year was probably the most beneficial," the 26-year-old Yankee said. "I lowered my arm angle a tad to get more movement on my fastball. I had freer arm action."
Russ Springer, another of the young home-grown pitchers now in the majors, has spent three autumns in the instructional league.
"It's positive to go there," he said. "It's helped me. You want to win down there, but you don't have the pressure where you have to win. You're working on things and you can afford to do that there."
Pat Kelly is another who spend every autumn playing in the instructional league.
"I was there working on my hitting," the second baseman said. "For me, the individual kind of work was important. I went in the cage, hit, looked at tapes, then hit again. It helped. It got me to the big leagues. It got me exposure. It showed them I had desire. I had the desire to be there when I could have been home sleeping."
This fall the Yankees' minor leaguers will have plenty of time to sleep.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Awlful Choice on Bosnia

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
The Bosnian "peace" conference under way in London has the earmarks of deadly farce. Western leaders make tough noises about standing up for principle -- the principle of not legitimizing Serb conquests in Bosnia -- and prepare to set up a long-term negotiating process. Meanwhile they know that their efforts will not work, or work in time, to stop Bosnian Muslims from being slaughtered or driven into refugee camps.
Their game at the conference is to evade the real and alarming choice: Either do what they can militarily and economically to back up their principles and save lives that way; or accept Serbian demands for partitioning Bosnia along ethnic lines, strike the best bargain they can, and save lives that way. 
 Bush officials duplicitously pretend otherwise. President Bush and Acting Secretary of State Eagleburger insist they will not reward Serbian aggression and will settle for nothing less than restoration of the rights and territory of Bosnian Muslims. Yet they know that nothing they are doing, or plan to do, will bring this about.
George Kenney, the Yugoslav desk officer in the State Department, declared as much Tuesday when he resigned from the Foreign Service.
Western Europe's policy is no less cynical than Washington's. European leaders say they are beginning a new chapter in the Yugoslav peace process, one that will take several months to show results. Yet they understand full well that there will be little left of the Muslims in Bosnia several months hence.
Winter arrives early in the Balkans, as Europeans are well aware. Soon it will entomb the hundreds of thousands of ill-clad and unhoused Muslims.
This real policy choice of which I speak is deeply troubling to me. It is doubly disturbing because I and others have argued for months for Western leaders to take steps that had a decent chance of avoiding the present trap. All in vain.
Western leaders answered with the worst sort of cynicism and duplicity. As public disgust over Serbian horrors mounted, they tried to quiet the uproar by flying in food for the Sarajevan victims (though doing nothing for the countless others in remote parts of Bosnia). Even as they fed the dying, they secretly seemed to hope that the Muslims would give up quickly so the whole mess would go away.
Then the Western leaders tried to sell the phoniest of arguments. They maintained there were only two choices: massive ground force deployments and thus a Vietnam-like quagmire, or what they were already doing, i.e. feeding victims.
In fact, there were and are lots of options short of dispatching ground troops. (Ironically, it was the U.S. that toyed briefly and idiotically with the idea of sending 100,000 troops to protect relief convoys, and verged on sliding into another quagmire.)
Months ago, Western leaders could have put U.N. monitors on the Greek and Romanian sides of their borders with Serbia. This would have sharply reduced trade with Serbia and made U.N. sanctions far more effective. Months ago, they could have begun proceedings to charge Serbian and Croatian leaders with war crimes and launched nonstop negotiations to apply constant world pressure. Only in recent days and weeks have they acknowledged and just begun to act on these options.
There is still more they can do, short of land war, to force the Serbs to think again. They can threaten air attacks against military targets in Serbia, like airfields and bridges to Bosnia. They can threaten to arm the virtually defenseless Muslims -- and Albanians in Kosovo, if necessary -- to discourage Serbia from spreading its policy of "ethnic cleansing."
Western leaders have not been without means to influence events in the Balkans. They have chosen to ignore and deny those means, for reasons (fear of runaway separatism in Europe, impending elections?) we are all free to speculate about. Nor will they explain why they will use air power in Iraq and not in Bosnia.
Now, in conscience, they must decide on a clear course. If they have no intention of taking tough action immediately, they should stop posturing about principle and strike the best deal possible with Serbs to save Muslim lives. Or, far preferably, they should do all they reasonably can to honor principle and save lives.

HEADLINE: Retraining Won't Undo 'Free Trade' Disaster

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Test of Mr. Clinton's Backbone" (editorial, Aug. 9) criticizes Representative Richard A. Gephardt's objection to the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. You cavalierly dismiss the valid concerns of labor and many manufacturers, although you don't mention them, over the agreement. Sure, people will lose jobs, you agree, but we can overcome the problem by retraining them. Retrain them for what? Selling hamburgers and fried chicken? To enter the automobile, electronics, computer and other distressed industries?
Retraining is no panacea for unemployment. It worked somewhat after World War II, but it has been a useless alternative ever since. It's an idea unsuitable to our troubled times. When you have a sick economy and a depressed and shrinking manufacturing base, it won't work. And even when the economy is humming, it's a questionable expedient. Even in welfare, retraining has been a wasteful effort; with all the retraining programs attempted in that area, what progress have we made in reducing welfare rolls? 
 Sorry, Representative Gephardt is right. What he and others are saying about the agreement with Mexico is true. Once the Bush Administration seals the agreement, the outcry will be nationwide and deafening. Take it from one who had been associated with an industry that has fallen victim to what you choose to call free trade.

HEADLINE: Retraining Won't Undo 'Free Trade' Disaster;
No to Transaction Tax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri has proposed a tax on trade between Mexico and the United States to finance retraining and adjustment for United States workers harmed by the transition to free trade and environmental infrastructure costs. Don Newquist, chairman of the International Trade Commission, states that while he does not prefer such a tax, it may be the only way to obtain the needed funds (Op-Ed, Aug. 12). The transaction tax is a bad idea. I will give three reasons why and suggest an alternative.
(1) Import tariffs are highly regressive. They are used as a revenue measure almost exclusively by countries unable to collect taxes through other more sophisticated techniques. Surely, we can do better. 
 (2) The average tariff on United States imports from Mexico is 4 percent. For the proposed transaction tax to raise sufficient sums, it would have to be at least 2 percent. If United States imports from Mexico are $35 billion, roughly their annualized level in 1992, this would raise $700 million. However, a 2 percent tax would remove half the benefit we hope to provide traders by gradually eliminating the tariff. It requires contortion to move two steps forward and simultaneously take one step back.
(3) Even more illogical, this transaction tax would apply only to United States exports destined for Mexico and Mexican exports to us. Third country traders, like Japan and Germany, could ship to either country without the tax. We would thus introduce discrimination against our own traders. This is lunacy. Charging the tax on imports from all sources has already been rejected by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade parties. They argue if the United States wishes to tax commodities as a revenue device, then tax all commodities, domestic and imported alike.
My suggestion for raising funds for the desirable purpose that Representative Gephardt and Mr. Newquist intend is to earmark the tariffs on imports from Mexico. This would raise at least double the revenue of a transaction tax of 2 percent. Since the revenue from these tariffs is scheduled to decline to zero over 10 years, we must start planning to do without these funds in any event. And it is the transition adjustment and retraining that is at issue here. Use the transition revenue to pay for the transition costs.

HEADLINE: HURRICANE ANDREW;
After Homes Are Ruined, Hopes Are Dashed

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 27

 BODY:
It is a figure that staggers the imagination: at least one of every 10 of the two million residents of Miami and its southern suburbs was left without a home by Hurricane Andrew. With the storm gone and the authorities occupied with cleaning up debris and delivering food and water, the many homeless are now searching, desperately and largely without help, for places to live.
In the working-class suburb of Princeton south of Miami, for instance, more than 40 members of the Soto family have been crowded into the four-bedroom home of the family patriarch, Jose Soto, since Monday. Over the years, nine of Mr. Soto's children, their spouses and 23 of his grandchildren have built or bought homes within blocks of his house. All were destroyed. 
 "We're all of us looking for places to live, but we just don't know where to go for help," Nelly Soto said this afternoon as she hauled ice from her car into her father's house, which was left without electricity or potable water.
 
The Boom to Come
 In the long run, the destruction inflicted on Dade County, which includes about 30 municipalities, is expected to lead to a construction and employment boom. Kate Hale, the director of emergency services for the county, estimated Wednesday that at least 63,000 single-family homes and apartment buildings have been destroyed.
But for the moment, thousands of families of every economic class and ethnic background share the Sotos' plight. If nothing else, the storm was indiscriminate, displacing a few millionaire owners of mansions in the Cocoplum section of Coral Gables as well as many migrant farm workers living in trailer parks.
Insurance claims adjusters have descended on Dade County, trying to find homeowners who need cash for emergency supplies and new housing. But the dire conditions here are making it hard for adjusters and customers to find each other, and the checks being written are hard to cash because so few banks have reopened. [Page A15.]
Carlos Vargas, a Homestead resident who works for the state welfare agency and whose own trailer was destroyed, said he had seen people wandering the streets in a daze, with nowhere to go and no idea of where to seek help. Those without friends or relatives, he said, "are either moving into abandoned buildings or taking shelter in construction sites."
 
Staying With Friends
 Ann Jones, a 43-year-old customer relations officer at a travel company that sells real estate time shares, was forced out of her three-bedroom house when the storm leveled everything except the kitchen. She and her two children are staying with friends.
"I'm a working single parent who lives from paycheck to paycheck, and I paid the mortgage just before the storm hit," she said. "When I get back to work, I'll get a paycheck, but I don't have the money in the bank right now to pay first, last and security" for temporary rental quarters, as most landlords here require.
Ms. Jones said she had been left homeless by a hurricane once before. While living in her native Mississippi in 1969, she lost her house to Hurricane Camille but was helped by a government relief effort.
"After Camille, they sent people out door to door right away to see what you needed, and within three months, I was in a brand new house built after the hurricane," she said. "But this time, there are no numbers to call for help on housing, and when you call the other emergency numbers, you can never get through to anybody."
In fact, Ms. Jones said, when she finally got through to the authorities this week, "they said that unless you have a real emergency, don't bother us." She is willing to concede that her situation might not qualify as a real emergency by current standards, "since I have a place to stay for two weeks," but she wonders what will happen to the legions of homeless.
Recently, southern Florida has been a buyer's or renter's market. As a result of overbuilding in the 1980's and the recession of the 1990's, it has been possible to rent a decent one-bedroom apartment for $250 a month or buy a four-bedroom house for under $100,000.
But real estate analysts here are already predicting that prices will rise sharply, to the disadvantage of those who used up their savings to become homeowners and may find themselves unable to re-enter the market.
One such person is Tressey Walker, a 21-year-old school crossing guard. With the help of her mother and sister, she paid cash for a house. "And now all that money has gone down the drain," Ms. Walker said of the ruined $80,000, four-bedroom house that she shared with her three children in the southern suburb of Perrine.
On the rental side, even those able to meet the various requirements of landlords are running into trouble. They are finding that demand for housing of every type has taken a sharp leap upward precisely as the supply has dropped even more abruptly.
"I went over to the apartment complex where my sister lives," Mae Johnson, a 40-year-old mother of two teen-agers, said as she waited in a food distribution line. "There are empty apartments, but the manager told me that the people already living there whose own apartments are messed up get first choice."
For the thousands who lived precariously in trailer parks or migrant labor camps, the situation is even more onerous. Olinda Bonilla, a 30-year-old plant nursery worker who came to Florida six years ago from El Salvador, sat on a cot in a shelter at Homestead Middle School this morning, her two children at her side, and acknowledged that the storm had dealt a blow to her hopes:
"I applied for public housing a year ago, and I thought my chances of getting something soon were good. Nobody has come to talk to me about where I'm going to live now, but since everything here has been destroyed, I suppose that the public housing is also gone, and that the people who used to live there are ahead of me."
Enormous as the number of homeless is already, government officials say they expect it to grow. Thousands of people in Dade County are still living in the rubble of their homes, hoping to fend off looters.
As has been the case with distribution of food and water, private enterprise has rushed to fill the wide gaps in official efforts to deal with the sudden housing crisis. The Greater Miami Apartment Association is making available a limited amount of free temporary housing to those who can prove they have been left homeless by the hurricane. Some real estate brokers are also offering, without commissions, to match those left homeless with apartments that are vacant.
 
Everyday Things a Problem
 Many real estate agencies, however, have been immobilized by the storm, with no telephone and electrical service and their offices and records destroyed or waterlogged. Branches of many banks are still closed, and many of those that are open are limiting withdrawals, so that even those homeless who still have checkbooks do not have the means to make a down payment or security deposit.
Government officials realize that sooner or later they will be forced to confront the housing crisis. Some, like Alex Muxo, City Manager of Homestead, 90 percent of whose 30,000 residents are believed to be without a place to live, are already trying to mobilize a construction effort to provide temporary quarters.
"One of the things we have thought of is possibly a tent city," Mr. Muxo said. But such a plan locally would require an effort beyond the abilities of the small municipalities south and west of Miami.
In the meantime, people like the Sotos wait. "Fifteen years of effort to get everybody into houses of their own, and it disappeared in hours," a tearful Maria Soto said this afternoon.

HEADLINE: After Two-Month Standoff, California Appears on Verge of Passing a Budget

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Aug. 27

 BODY:
It has taken nearly two months, two agonizing months, during which California has been forced to pay it bills with i.o.u.'s, seen its once-enviable credit rating ruined, its old and poor threatened with loss of health care and its college classes shut. But it appears now that the Government of California, paralyzed by recession, is finally close to passing a budget.
Weariness, lack of pay, panic over getting re-elected, public ridicule and political realities are combining to force members of the Legislature to end a protracted stalemate with Gov. Pete Wilson in erasing a $10.7 billion budget gap. The likely winner in this standoff, at least in the short run, is the Republican Governor, but it remains to be seen how the public responds to the painful cuts in public services he would impose. 
 The settlement that is emerging reflects the fiendishly complex world of California politics: the Governor and the Democratic Speaker of the State Assembly, Willie L. Brown Jr. of San Francisco, are like two scorpions in a bottle; the 250,000-member California Teachers Association holds enormous political power and throws its weight behind Mr. Brown, and the powerful Democratic President pro tem of the State Senate, David A. Roberti of Los Angeles, seems to want Governor Wilson to make him a judge when term limits force him to retire in two years.
 
Resigned to Accepting Cuts
 To isolate Speaker Brown, Governor Wilson is backing a deal being worked out by Mr. Roberti and the Republican leader, Senator Kenneth L. Maddy of Fresno. The liberal Mr. Brown, in turn, has been courting the Republican right wingers in the Assembly who have little love for the more moderate Republican Governor.
Oddly, the budget is snagged not over how to balance this year's broken budget but over the Governor's efforts to limit the growth in state spending for public education in future years. Having accepted the reality that there is no more money and having given up on raising taxes, liberal Democrats have glumly resigned themselves to enormous cuts in welfare, university support and other programs, but not on future education spending.
On Friday, the Senate is expected to pass the Roberti-Maddy plan, which closely resembles the Governor's own proposal. Its fate in the Assembly is less certain because of Mr. Brown's opposition. Agreement is difficult because the California Constitution requires a two-third's vote on budget matters, or 54 votes in an Assembly with 47 Democrats and 33 Republicans.
But there are growing signs that the Speaker is losing his grip on his battle-weary troops. "People here are truly exhausted," said Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin, a Democrat from Union City who is chairwoman of the Education Committee. "Every incumbent is in great danger now. If the Senate accepts it, there will be great pressure on us to accept." She added, referring to the Governor, "People feel, give this knucklehead what he wants."
Speaker Brown said on Wednesday that he would "lock down" the Assembly on Friday until a budget was passed. The legislative session officially ends on Monday.
In an interview as he walked into the Capitol this morning, Governor Wilson expressed confidence a conclusion was near. "It sounds like they intend to finish before we need a special session," he said. "They don't want that for sure because it means we have to start from scratch."
Whatever the precise details of the budget agreement, it will mean the beginning of the dismantling of many of California's vaunted social and educational services as the state copes with its worst economic downturn since World War II. State spending is expected to drop by more than $2 billion this fiscal year compared with last, or about 5 percent.
To be cut are health and welfare programs, by from 4.5 percent to 10 percent; Medi-Cal, the state's health-care plan for the poor, will be slashed by eliminating such "optional" programs as dental care for adults. The state's program for the retarded will lose about $100 million of the $700 million it gets. Fees at the three state college systems are going up drastically as state support for them drops by $419 million, or 10 percent.
But the fight over education has been the toughest, even though spending for schools would continue to grow under the Wilson plan. In 1988, voters passed a constitutional amendment, Proposition 98, that guarantees 40 percent of the general fund to education, except when revenues falter because of a poor economy.
The Governor now wants to "recapture" $1.1 billion of this money from last year, saying local school districts got more than they were entitled to because of the economic slump. But rather than make them repay money already spent, Mr. Wilson would apply the $1.1 billion as a "prepayment" on the current 1992-93 fiscal year and add another $732 million, essentially "loans" to be repaid from Proposition 98 money due in 1993-94 and 1994-95.
Together with $300 million diverted from the 107-campus community college system, which will be forced to raise fees, this would keep state support for public schools steady for this year.
In an interview, the Governor's Secretary of Child Development and Education, Maureen G. DiMarco, said this allowed the schools to keep up with new enrollment and actually increase spending per pupil by 1 percent.
But education leaders cried foul this week. On Wednesday, the elected Superintendent of Public Instruction, Bill Honig, called this "questionable gimmickry" that would reduce the base for school financing in future years and cost public schools $2.9 billion in support they otherwise would have been entitled to over the next four years.
 
"This Is Exploitation'
 Detractors say the Governor is using the school financing to position himself for re-election in 1994, that he is hoping that by limiting growth in Proposition 98 support now he will have a surplus to give schools a healthy "bump" in 1994. "This is exploitation of a real fiscal crisis for positioning," said Ralph J. Flynn, executive director or the California Teachers Association.
The teachers union's political action committee is by far the most potent single political force in California. During the last fiscal year it gave a total of $455,038 to legislators, 83 percent to Democrats. The largest recipient was Speaker Brown ($50,733), even though he has no significant opposition. The second largest recipient ($26,000) was Assemblywoman Doris Allen, a Republican from Orange County; she voted against the Republican Governor on a recent important budget vote.
The union also can marshal enormous forces on Election Day. It is therefore extremely difficult for incumbents, mainly Democrats, to defy its wishes on the budget. Indeed, cynics in Sacramento, of which there are several, argue that Speaker Brown is less interested in blocking Governor Wilson's budget than showing he tried to accommodate the teachers union.
"Oftentimes, he holds onto his positions, but bills pass," said Senator Maddy, the Republican leader, who said that the "more reasonable" members of the Assembly were "just waiting" for something to vote on.
And in the Assembly, the realities were beginning to sink in. "More and more we hear from our constituents, 'get any budget,' and the nuances of the Governor's not wanting to negotiate get lost," said Assemblyman Richard Katz, a Democrat from Los Angeles who opposes the education cuts.
But if the Governor wins, it may be a Pyrrhic victory. "Ultimately all these crises end up hurting the Governor," said a top Republican who is a friend of Mr. Wilson. "It is naive and unrealistic to think people won't blame the guy at the top. His only advantage is that he has a couple of years to redeem himself."

HEADLINE: HURRICANE ANDREW;
Destroyed: Front Line in Fight Against Cocaine Traffickers

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
One of the nation's most important Federal drug interdiction centers was destroyed by Hurricane Andrew, and the Customs Commissioner said today that she expected narcotics traffickers to try to take advantage of the crisis in the next several days and flood South Florida with cocaine and other illegal drugs.
But the Commissioner, Carol Hallett, said Customs operation centers in Jacksonville, Tampa and San Juan, P.R., had assumed radar and aircraft surveillance from the damaged installation at Homestead Air Force Base near Miami. 
 "We've been able to move people around and back up from other air branches," Commissioner Hallett said in a telephone interview from Miami. "There is not one opportunity created by this to give traffickers the slightest edge."
 
Might Never Reopen
 This is the second time in 47 years that Homestead has been destroyed by a hurricane, and it is unclear whether the base, which was already being considered for closing, will ever be rebuilt.
The Air Force sent 85 people to comb through the rubble at Homestead and determine how much damage had been done. Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, the Air Force chief of staff, said in an interview that it would take at least three months to restore power lines and water service at the base, and several more months to clean up the remaining debris at the 3,300-acre installation.
"The chances of returning there within a year are remote," said another senior Air Force official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Last year, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, a panel charged by Congress with closing unneeded bases to cut military spending, named Homestead as a candidate to be shut down. The severity of the damage has prompted Air Force and Government officials to consider not rebuilding the base at all.
"It would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to put that base back into the shape it was before," General McPeak said. Over the next few months Air Force officials will be analyzing rebuilding costs, he said.
Built in 1942, Homestead was destroyed three years later, on Sept. 15, 1945, by a hurricane with winds of 145 miles an hour. It was officially abandoned three months later. In the three years it was open, Homestead trained hundreds of the Air Force pilots who flew the Berlin Air Lift of 1948. It was rebuilt in 1955 and played a significant role in the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, when its bombers and fighter planes were placed on high alert and a tent city of 10,000 Army troops occupied the base.
In recent years, Homestead has been home to an active-duty F-16 fighter wing and the Air Force's water-survival school for air crews, as well as significant elements of the Government program to stop cocaine smugglers headed for the eastern United States.
On Tuesday, all operations and maintenance buildings, the commissary and post exchange were destroyed. All of the remaining 200 public buildings lost their roofs. Two hangars were destroyed, along with two F-16 fighters inside, valued at $14 million each. The Pentagon said that the roofs had also been blown off half the housing on the base and that windows had been shattered in 90 percent of the houses.
The Air Force is scrambling to help the base's 4,400 military personnel and their 4,900 family members who were evacuated before the storm hit. Many of them are living in emergency shelters in or near Dade County. General McPeak said the Air Force would reassign them to other bases as soon as possible.
General McPeak said that the fighter wing's three squadrons would be split up and relocated to other bases. No decision has been made on the fate of an Air Force Reserve F-16 squadron located at Homestead, he said.
The Air Force said the base pumps more than $405.8 million into the Miami-area economy and generates more than 4,000 civilian jobs.
The drug interdiction center lost a Black Hawk helicopter and a Cessna airplane when the maintenance hangar in which they were stored collapsed in the hurricane. But 14 other small Customs aircraft had been flown to Tallahassee before the storm.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
The Clinton Bus Goes to Texas, A Tossup State

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Aug. 27

 BODY:
No Democrat has made it to the White House in this century without winning Texas, and today Gov. Bill Clinton went after Texas.
Sweeping from San Antonio to Austin and then heading for Waco in a caravan of buses, accompanied by his running mate, Senator Al Gore, the Democratic nominee relentlessly criticized President Bush's economic policies in an effort to lock up the state's 32 electoral votes. 
 "We need you, Texas," he shouted time and again at rallies and impromptu stops at highway crossroads.
 
Sagging Economy
 Polls indicate that Texas, President Bush's official home and fertile ground for Republicans in recent years, is a tossup at this point in the 1992 race.
The sagging economy is the major aid to Mr. Clinton's effort, but he has also been helped by his being the Governor of a neighboring Southern state, Arkansas.
Like Mr. Clinton, the President has vowed to fight strongly for Texas.
Mr. Clinton was working a rich lode and striking some pay dirt today if the size of the crowd here -- about 10,000 -- and the resonance of its cheers -- deafening -- are reliable indicators.
Caught up in enthusiasm of the partisan audience, Mr. Clinton cried out at the end of his speech, pointing toward a distant, heavily peopled line of trees: "I ask you for your vote -- you, way back underneath that tree, and that tree, and up in that tree."
 
'October Crowd in August'
 Mr. Gore, looking out over the sea of upturned faces and brightly painted political placards, said, "This is an October crowd in August."
Texas has been hard-hit economically not only by the national recession but also by a severe depression in its huge energy industry and cutbacks in military and space programs.
"There are lots of things that I want to do that will be good for Texas," Mr. Clinton said in San Antonio, enumerating the state's hardships during a morning rally. "I'm going to revitalize the energy industry by emphasizing natural gas production and getting more reliance on domestic production, by conservation and by less reliance on foreign oil. I support the space program, and I support new military technology."
Warming up the San Antonio crowd for Mr. Clinton, Gary Mauro, the Texas Land Commissioner and also the chairman of the Clinton campaign in the state, said Mr. Clinton had come to Texas with one overriding message.
"We want jobs in Texas," he said. "We want jobs in Texas. We want jobs in Texas."
Playing a similar role at the start of the Austin rally, Gov. Ann W. Richards said there was one overriding reason the Clinton-Gore ticket would be victorious in the fall. "This is the worst economic situation in Texas in my lifetime -- and I didn't get this hair of mine out of a bottle," she said. Mrs. Richards's hair is white.
The latest Clinton-Gore bus caravan, the fourth since July 17, ends Friday in Tyler. Campaign officials say Clinton poll takers will go to work in the state early next week to assess the impact of the tour on voters.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Says Clinton Is Playing To Voters' Economic Worry

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FINDLAY, Ohio, Aug. 27

 BODY:
President Bush hammered away at Gov. Bill Clinton's political positions today, charging on a Midwestern campaign trek that his rival's foreign-trade policies would destroy jobs and investment and trigger a "worldwide contraction" in economic growth.
Speaking to workers at a factory in St. Louis and at a new industrial park in Findlay, the President likened Mr. Clinton to a "fear monger" who is playing to voters' economic anxieties by proposing to hamstring foreign competitors. 
 "I don't have to ask you to go back to the history books, but there was an occasion when that happened, right before the Great Depression," Mr. Bush said. "And we're fighting our way out of a tough recession now, and we don't need to throw more Americans out of work."
 
Quick Response From Clinton
 The Clinton campaign responded quickly with its own brusque attack on Mr. Bush's economic stewardship.
"Bill Clinton just believes we can do better than the no-growth, no-jobs policies of George Bush," said George Stephanopoulos, the Democratic candidate's communications director. "All George Bush wants to do is cut taxes for the rich."
To find joblessness and privation, Mr. Stephanopoulos suggested, "You don't have to go back 50 years -- you only have to go back three and one half."
By many measures, Mr. Bush has presided over the slowest rate of economic growth since the Depression in the 1930's.
The President's remarks were the climax of a week of speechmaking that has struggled to shift that aura of economic failure from the White House to Mr. Clinton and the Democratic-controlled Congress. This Midwestern swing began what Bush aides said would be a sustained effort to sharpen the differences between Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton on central issues, from taxes to the environment.
 
Differ on Trade Policy
 The attack on Mr. Clinton's trade policies brought into relief one of the sharpest distinctions between the two men. Mr. Bush says he can restore the nation's economic health by lowering taxes and reducing trade barriers, creating export-related jobs here.
Mr. Clinton says he supports greater foreign trade, too. But he has also complained that some foreign nations have an unfair edge over American workers, and that foreign companies should pay more taxes to support American job-training programs.
Under pressure from traditionally Democratic labor unions, Mr. Clinton has declined to endorse an agreement reached this month by the Bush Administration to create a free-trade zone embracing Canada, the United States and Mexico. The unions contend that the agreement will cause a loss of American factory jobs as some companies move to Mexico.
Mr. Clinton's budget proposals assume an additional $38 billion over four years in higher tax revenue from foreign companies that build or buy plants and offices in the United States.
Gene B. Sperling, Mr. Clinton's director for economic issues, said the Democratic nominee has called for tougher collection of existing taxes but has not explicitly endorsed the adoption of any new legislation.
"The aim and intention is not to increase taxes," Mr. Sperling said. "The aim and intention is to make people pay what they owe."
Mr. Bush criticized both of Mr. Clinton's positions today on a three-city tour in Missouri and Ohio.
The President's most bitter attack came in St. Louis, in a speech to about 1,000 workers at an emergency light-and-siren factory. There, he initially drew polite applause but won a long standing ovation after an attack on Mr. Clinton's policies.
"Governor Clinton says his tax increase will crack down on foreign companies," Mr. Bush said. "But that crackdown is more like an eviction notice. And when those companies pack their bags, they'll take those jobs with them. His tax would not only destroy jobs and reduce investment here, it would do the same throughout the global economy, causing a worldwide contraction."
In one of his most pointed attacks, the President said he knows Mr. Clinton's reputation is that of an "opportunist -- as the kind of guy who will say anything, do anything for political gain."
"But he should understand what's at stake here," Mr. Bush continued. "And if he doesn't understand, let me tell him. These are American jobs he's playing politics with."
In what seemed to signal a round of attacks on Mr. Clinton's political credibility, Mr. Bush also accused Mr. Clinton twice today of trying to straddle both sides of controversial issues, using quotations from his opponent's own public remarks to make his point.
In St. Louis, the President ridiculed Mr. Clinton's refusal either to endorse or oppose the free-trade pact. And later, at a rally in downtown Cincinnati, Mr. Bush accused his rival of backpedaling on a proposal to raise fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles. The President has said the plan would increase joblessness among auto workers.
Mr. Clinton said last Friday that he "never said that we shouldn't be flexible" in finding ways to increase fuel efficiency.
To that, Mr. Bush replied: "Is there a pattern going on here? Will Governor Clinton say anything to anybody?"

BARBARA BUSH ATTACKS DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 27

 BODY:
Barbara Bush wrapped up her post-convention campaign swing in California today with some of the most partisan remarks of her political life, attacking Congressional Democrats and warning of economic doom under Bill Clinton.
"We have good programs, but the Congress is so wrapped up in their own scandals and their own funny doings that they're not willing to back good programs," she said in a radio interview on KABC-AM. 
 "Ever since the Democrats took over the Senate, it's just been an enormous fight," she said. "And what we're hoping is going to happen is they're going to clean the House and clean the Senate and give us a Republican President with a Republican Congress. Then watch how things grow."

HEADLINE: Between Four Rocks and a Hard Place

 BODY:
A dispute over four islands, lingering legacies of the cold war, threatens Japanese-Russian relations and an infusion of much-needed Japanese capital to the Russian economy. Both proud nations need to reach some accommodation and begin to close the books on their past when Boris Yeltsin, Russia's President, visits Tokyo in two weeks.
Japan says the islands belonged to it until Stalin seized them after the World War II surrender in 1945, and wants them back. But rising assertiveness among Russian nationalists, and a restive Russian military, could threaten any government in Moscow bold enough to commit itself to return all four islands. 
 The solution is a compromise that would return two of the islands now. The others could be jointly developed under dual sovereignty, paving the way for eventual reversion.
The islands cause patriotic hearts to pound in both countries. Though Mr. Yeltsin wants to strengthen economic ties with Tokyo, nationalists in Parliament and the military argue that returning the islands would be a sign of Russian weakness. They also fear loss of control of the ice-free straits between the Sea of Okhotsk and the Pacific Ocean.
These fears may dwindle if the U.S. agrees to downsize its naval operations in the area. The nationalists also overvalue the islands' untapped wealth, compared with Russia's need for foreign investment. Finally, U.S. experience suggests that Russia's prestige won't suffer. America's standing rose when it returned Okinawa to Japan in 1971.
Tokyo has no interest in putting Mr. Yeltsin between four rocks and a hard place. It can accept two islands now and two later and still provide generous aid and investment. And Washington could help broker such a compromise, opening a new era in Asian security.

Nodding to Bullies

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
The Serbian onslaught in what was Yugoslavia differs in many ways from the Iraqi occupation two years ago. But the two murderous aggressions have at least one element in common. Both were encouraged by the diplomacy of the Bush Administration.
Everyone remembers what Saddam Hussein took as a green light for his attack. A week before he moved, the U.S. Ambassador to Baghdad, April Glaspie, told him that the United States had "no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts like your border disagreement with Kuwait." 
 Ambassador Glaspie is indelibly associated with that disastrous piece of diplomacy. But she was only carrying out Administration policy. Secretary of State Baker instructed her on July 24, 1990, that the U.S. had "no position" on border disputes. And of course this followed years of U.S. aid to the Iraqi dictator.
In Yugoslavia, President Bush was warned by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1990 that the country would break up, probably within 18 months. That unusually firm prediction was made in a National Intelligence Estimate.
But Mr. Bush premised U.S. policy on the continuation of a united Yugoslavia. His instinct for the status quo overrode the reality of events on the ground -- as it had in the Soviet Union, where he held out to the end in support of Mikhail Gorbachev and the survival of the U.S.S.R.
In 1991, therefore, as the strains in Yugoslavia reached the breaking point, the United States position was that it preferred "unity and democracy" there. The Bush Administration said nothing to warn the Serbs against maintaining "unity" by violence. And that silence was crucial.
Prof. Charles Gati, a specialist on Eastern Europe, writes in the current issue of Foreign Affairs that the Bush position was interpreted by the Serbian leadership "as a green light to make Croatia stay within a united Yugoslav federation." There followed brutal Serbian military attacks on Vukovar, Dubrovnik and other parts of Croatia. From there the Serbs moved on to aggression in Bosnia.
"If the United States had done in mid-1991 as it is doing in mid-1992," Professor Gati writes, "the Serbians in Belgrade and Bosnia-Herzegovina might well have been deterred from proceeding as they have."
The same point was made recently by The Economist of London in an extended treatment of the Bosnian tragedy. It criticized both the Bush Administration and West European governments for not warning the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, early on against aggression.
"The sooner one stands up to a bully," The Economist said, "the less force it takes."
The best account of the diplomatic record is a piece by John Newhouse in The New Yorker, rich in detail and sharp in analysis. He again faults the U.S. and its European allies for their diplomacy in Yugoslavia.
"The key Western governments flouted some first principles of statecraft," Mr. Newhouse says. For one thing, they "made clear what they wouldn't do in Yugoslavia" -- use force -- "thereby surrendering the heavy advantage of ambiguity."
Even after Yugoslavia unmistakably ceased to exist, and Serbian violence became flagrant, the Bush Administration's response was feeble. Its hallmarks, in Mr. Newhouse's words, were "passivity and uncertainty." As recently as last month President Bush dismissed the horror in Bosnia as "a hiccup."
America's voice was the one that could have made the difference. If the Bush Administration had told Mr. Milosevic at the beginning that violence would not be tolerated, I am convinced that he would have kept his guns silent. If we had moved American ships in the Mediterranean when the Serbs shelled Dubrovnik last fall, or when they shot down a European Community helicopter, I think they would have pulled back.
But Mr. Bush did essentially nothing -- until Bill Clinton called for armed protection of relief operations, to be authorized by the U.N. The President's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, called that idea "reckless." Then Mr. Bush adopted it.
Success in American foreign policy -- real success -- lies in preventing war by making clear that there would be a strong response. That is where Presidents succeeded throughout the cold war. It is where George Bush failed in Iraq and Yugoslavia.

HEADLINE: Bridgeport Agrees to Expand 2 Waste Businesses

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Aug. 27

 BODY:
Officials today announced an agreement that could bring hundreds of construction jobs and millions in revenue to this perpetually cash-starved city: a plan to expand the regional garbage incinerator here and build a sewage-sludge processing plant next to it.
"This is an industrial town, and this is industry," Mayor Joseph Ganim said, putting the best face on the city's efforts to build up its battered revenue base. "This is a benefit to the taxpayers." 
 The financial pressures have not let up on Mayor Ganim since he took office last November and withdrew the city's attempt to resolve its financial problems in Federal bankruptcy court. Facing an $18 million deficit, he had no guarantees of aid from a state government that was sympathetic but too short of money itself to offer a bailout.
Nine months later, Mr. Ganim has managed to satisfy the state financial review board that oversees Bridgeport's budget, but some residents and elected officials are growing unhappy over the price the city is paying as it searches for a few million dollars in revenue here and a few million there.
 
Frustrated With the Opposition
 Earlier this week, for example, the current budget was finally balanced by selling the state 210 acres of city parkland for $5.9 million.
Mayor Ganim acknowledged the opposition, and his frustration with it, today in announcing the incinerator plan. Opponents, including environmentalists, politicians and residents of Black Rock, the neighborhood next to the city's harborfront industrial district, are a small group of "obstructionists," he said, "when the city still has serious financial problems."
While the opposition fears that Bridgeport could become a dumping ground for western Connecticut, Mr. Ganim said that expanding the Bridgeport Resco garbage-to-energy plant operated by Wheelabrator Environmental Systems made strong economic sense for the city.
The plant already has long-term contracts to burn garbage from Bridgeport and 17 other communities. Adding a fourth 750-ton-a-dayboiler would allow Resco, a Wheelabrator subsidiary, to seek contracts with Stamford, which is having problems with its incinerator, and New Haven and Waterbury, which are running out of landfill space, said the plant manager, James Dougherty. Those cities have not been approached, however.
For Bridgeport, the plan would provide $3 million when Resco obtains financing for the expansion, which Mayor Ganim is counting on for his next budget.
Similarly, the city would be paid $2 million when Resco obtains financing for a plant that would dry treated sewage sludge into a form usable in fertilizer. The plant would be designed to handle sludge from several communities besides Bridgeport.
In addition, Mr. Ganim said, the $1.8 million a year the city is now paid by Resco for being host to the incinerator would increase by $4 million a year if the expanded plant operates at 85 percent of its capacity.
Mr. Dougherty estimated that the expansion would create 800 construction jobs in Bridgeport, and that permanent employment would increase by 96 positions.
The plan is supported by unions and the Bridgeport Regional Business Council. But there is unease among aldermen at the way earlier decisions, like the sale of city parkland, have been rushed through with little time for close examination. They have insisted on seeing detailed information about Wheelabrator's proposal well before a public hearing next Thursday.
 
Losing a Piece of the City
 The aldermen's frustration over being pressured to support short-term budget repairs boiled over last week when Mayor Ganim presented the park deal's terms and asked for a vote with no public hearing.
The deal was crucial for Mayor Ganim, because it provided not only the $5.9 million for this year's budget, but also $9 million for the next budget, from the sale of the city's zoo, Beardsley Zoo, and its premier park, Beardsley Park, to the state.
While Connecticut has promised to maintain the land as a state urban park, it galled many residents and aldermen to lose a piece of the city for a quick budget solution. Some have observed that the city is now doing voluntarily what it could not have been forced to do under bankruptcy: sell off its assets.
"The sale addresses strictly a short-term, one-time budget gap," said Alderman Thomas White, a Republican. "But the transfer of our parkland appears, in this case, likely to be permanent."
Alderwoman Mary Bruce, a Democrat, referring to the University of Bridgeport's financial rescue by an arm of the Unification Church, asked: "If this passes tonight, what's next? What happens when the Reverend Moon makes an offer we can't refuse?"
This morning, as the Mayor was announcing the plans for the new waste operations, an auctioneer at City Hall was trying for the second time to sell off hundreds of tax-delinquent properties to erase a $2.5 million deficit left from the city's last fiscal year.
At the close of business, Bridgeport's finance director, Jerome I. Baron, reported that 60 tax-delinquent properties, out of 287 offered, had been sold at auction, for a total of $551,000.

HEADLINE: Giving the Jobless Tips and Hope

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

DATELINE: VALHALLA, N.Y., Aug. 27

 BODY:
Mel Speier learned some lessons today about maneuvering through the slippery economy, lessons like making sure that his business cards highlight his professional experience and his resume doesn't read like an obituary.
Mr. Speier, an executive who was laid off from a steel importing firm eight months ago, already had a briefcase stuffed with resumes when he came to a conference for the unemployed and the underemployed at Westchester Community College. 
 "You never know who you'll meet," said the 48-year-old Mr. Speier, his gaze cutting through the crowd.
Those he was likely to meet at the conference -- which coincided with the release of new unemployment figures for the state -- were hundreds of other people who did not need to be told the news to know that times are bad. Their expressions reflected the realities of the job market -- rejection, anxiety and anger.
 
'Sense of Betrayal'
 "A lot of them feel a sense of betrayal," said Thomas Corban, an economist with the New York State Labor Department, which jointly sponsored the job search conference with the community college. "They've done everything they thought was needed to insure them a lifelong job and they have found themselves jobless. There's a sense that the social contract between employer and worker has been broken."
The figures released today showed no sign of improvement in employment in the region last month. In Westchester County and Long Island, the rates hit the highest levels last month of any July since 1977.
"What these numbers are saying is that this region, which got into trouble well before other parts of the country, has had an extraordinary downturn that has been more severe here than in other parts of the country and is now having much more difficulty getting out of it," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.
To counter such a bleak outlook, the conference offered workshops in a variety of subjects like starting a new business, writing a resume and building self-esteem. Conference organizers told job seekers to concentrate their energy on potentially brighter spots in the economy, like job opportunities in the service industries, and urged them to use previous job experiences to sell their way into jobs that they never would have dreamed of before.
 
'Trying Everything'
 "I'm trying everything at this point," said Marie Harrington, an education consultant who was laid off eight months ago from a large chemical company. She said she is now considering fund-raising as a profession, and hoped to do some "networking" at the conference.
But the 52-year-old woman, who lives in Yonkers, said her joblessness gnaws at her every day, particularly when she sees commuters on their way to work.
"I was raised with a very strong work ethic and it's been very difficult," she said. "They tell you not to take it personally when you're laid off. But you realize who stayed and who was let go and you realize it is personal."
 
A Career Switch
 Like many other job seekers, Everett Smith is trying to make a switch in careers. His leap may be bigger than most. Mr. Smith, a long-distance truck driver by trade, is training for a career as an accountant.
He feels on shaky ground because he now works for a trucking company that transports cargo for General Motors. "You know what happened to them," he said of G.M., which has laid off scores of workers during the recession.
Mr. Smith, who is 42, said his employers have not told him anything to make him worry. But he said he does not want to take any chances.
"You learn more from what you're not told than what you're told," he said. "I've seen the changes in the American labor force and I realize my skills are just not compatible with the world economy."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Manhattan Samples Suburbia

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
WHO is the audience? Who are things made for? Who buys the room fresheners, eats the new breakfast foods, reads the revamped magazines?
We do. We say, we'll try it. We'll pick up a trial size. Maybe we'll like it. Or maybe we'll end up feeling that we're the ones on trial. Do we belong in this target group? Do we want in or out? If we use enough of this stuff, will we get normal? 
 Not light thoughts for a late summer stroll in the park, perhaps. But when the setting is Hudson River Park, the new sylvan enclave on the northern edge of Battery Park City, such musings are not out of place. Hudson River Park is a trial-size park. Its 8.2 lushly landscaped acres are generous enough for several visits. If you live nearby, you'll visit often, particularly when the northern entrance to the park (at West and Laight Streets) opens this weekend. (The southern entrance to the park, which is open from dawn to dusk, is at West and Vesey Streets.)
But wherever you live, Hudson River Park is worth a close look. For if this trial succeeds, some variation of it may be coming soon to a waterfront near you. What we see here now could be a preview: a starter emerald for the "green necklace" city planners hope will eventually adorn the city's edge. As such, it represents a critical step in New York's efforts to build its way into the future.
The future will take some getting used to. We're accustomed to the industrial waterfront, or at least the decayed remnants of it, a once bustling place of shipping and manufacturing. Now, the edge of the city is shifting from production to consumption, from work to pleasure. It will require some mental adjustment to replace the blue collar with the green necklace, the image of tug boats and longshoremen with a new picture of fancy yachts and Sunday strollers.
The Battery Park City Authority, the builder of Hudson River Park, has made a substantial contribution to the adjustment. In designing the park, the authority paid uncommonly close attention to the desires of the local community. Speaking through their Community Board No. 1, TriBeCa and Battery Park City residents made clear that they didn't want the kind of public space the authority had created in the past. Instead of critically acclaimed public art projects prescribed by art experts, the community wanted waterfront pleasures with a somewhat lower brow. Active recreation, like half-courts for basketball. Sliding boards and swings for the children. A fountain gushing into a lily pond. Winding paths. Restrooms. A lawn with volleyball nets. Community gardens. And they didn't want these features threaded through blocks of buildings, like the feats of integrated urban design elsewhere at Battery Park City. They wanted open spaces concentrated in one generous landscaped expanse.
Clearly, the Battery Park City Authority believes in public service with a smile. It has rendered the community's wishes into a lavish portrait of a city at play. Designed by the Cambridge, Mass., firm Carr, Lynch, Hack & Sandell, with landscaping by Oehme, van Sweden & Associates of Washington, Hudson River Park is a "people's park" that's gone to heaven. Good design, a hallmark throughout Battery Park City, is once again on ample display. Materials and detailing are of supreme quality. The plantings could go right into HG magazine with only minimal touchup. But the focus has shifted from public art to public enjoyment. That emphasis is evident not only in the playground (designed by Johannson & Walcavage of Brooklyn) and other active recreation areas, but also in such refinements as setting the height of the park's granite walls so that people can comfortably perch upon them.
Passive pastimes are not stinted here. Loosely organized in a linear sequence along a serpentine promenade, and allowed to spill over onto the large lawn, the park's recreational areas unfold as a series of visual tableaux: vignettes of New Yorkers in the process of discovering how to use a waterside park. The river itself is the park's greatest visual asset. On Monday evenings, when pop music is performed at the park's pavilion, it feels like a sinful indulgence to turn one's back on the Hudson's majestic sweep, even though the urban backdrop of Manhattan skyscrapers is comparably grand.
These stunning backdrops offer more than drama. They also provide Hudson River Park with a visual unity that has eluded the park's designers. Considering that the park began as a wish list, perhaps it's not surprising that the end result is less a park than an inventory of features in search of one. For while there's consistency in such elements as paving and masonry walls, the parts do not cohere into the organic unity of nature or of art.
The landscape design aims for a picturesque park in the Frederick Law Olmsted tradition. But it's as if the designers have flattened Olmsted out with a rolling pin. In technical terms, the design is Olmsted in plan but not elevation. We have curving paths, but they curve along flat surfaces. They do not, as in Central Park, rise and descend through earth ridges and rock outcroppings. There was good cause to avoid such contours; they would have blocked the water views that are the park's most compelling attraction. Nonetheless, as a friend remarked, Olmsted without elevation is a miniature golf course.
The flat landscape allows the park's architectural elements undue prominence. In Central Park, gazebos and other features gradually materialize. They slip in and out of sight as you move through the landscape. The flat terrain at Hudson River Park doesn't permit this arcadian peek-a-boo. Instead, the park's built features rise up from the landscape like a row of houses on a suburban street.
The styles in which these features are executed reinforce the suburban impression. They're the familiar trio of home decoration: Classical, Traditional and Contemporary. For Classical, we've got a pavilion designed by Demetri Porphyrios, its wooden roof supported by columns with Ionic and Phrygian columns. The Traditional slot is filled by bishop's-crook lampposts and by the Park House, a rusticated stone structure with a shingled roof, modeled after Boston's 19th-century commuter rail stations.
Rough concrete walls give the basketball court a Contemporary look, but for the real cutting-edge statement, you call in an artist. In this case, Tom Otterness has made a small fantasy of a parklet, called "The Real World," that combines his familiar doughboy figures with exotic fauna in a madcap romp among piles of coins. But beneath their outward playfulness, these forms evoke a rancid Marxist take on the education of middle-class children. The hint here is that children's fables -- the pot of gold, the enchanted castle -- are veiled lessons for raising children to become materialistic monsters (like the developers of luxury housing for the city's emerald green necklace). What comes through in the sculptures' sugar-coated Marxism is the sugar-coating, however, not the Marx. This may be a blessing. But it is also a tribute to Battery Park City's power to reduce once radical propositions to sweetness and light. And it's this power, rather than the green lawns or their immaculate upkeep, that accounts for Hudson River Park's suburban atmosphere. The park's multiplicity of styles is an urban equivalent of the suburban paradox. Freedom of choice has been reduced to a norm: a staggering array of consumer choices that, like frozen entrees, somehow all turn out the same. No matter what the thermometer readings have been this summer, at Hudson River Park it's always 98.6.
The suburban atmosphere is no accident. It's the natural consequence of Battery Park City's mission to woo upper-middle-class residents back from suburbia. And the effects of this mission, too, take some getting used to. Even those who believe that the city cannot afford to lose more middle-income residents may find it uncomfortable to embrace the strategies required to retain them. We're used to government programs that house the poor. Luxury housing projects are an unfamiliar breed, and it's premature to judge whether their impact will be to further divide rich from poor or to help bridge the gap by shoring up the middle ground.
Yet it's only in the city that such projects are new. Suburbia has been a luxury housing project all along. The $18 million it took to create Hudson River Park (it actually came in $2 million under budget) is nothing compared to the vast sums suburbia routinely absorbs in highway funds and tax incentives. That's the competition the city is up against. The risk, of course, is that in competing against the suburb the city will end up becoming one. For decades, other cities have fought against the "Manhattanization" of their skylines. For New Yorkers, the prospect may well be the suburbanization of the shoreline, if not the entire metropolis.
Hudson River Park provides a chance to sort out our feelings about that prospect. It's dreary, of course, to contemplate a future in which New York, New York, has joined Classic and Traditional as one more homogenized decorative style. It's drearier still to contemplate a city subsiding without protest into the wreckage of its industrial past. For now, it might be best to think of Hudson River Park as evidence of a city willing to experiment with different visions of its future. Here, New York gets to try on an image of itself as a normal city with normal people living in it. For now, at least, the image doesn't quite fit.
 
Getting There
 Hudson River Park is west of the World Trade Center in Battery Park City. By subway, it can be reached from the Cortlandt Street-World Trade Center stop on the IRT line via the Nos. 1 and 9 trains or the BMT line on the N and R trains. Another option is the IND line on A, C or E trains to Chambers Street. M9, M10 and M22 buses go to Battery Park City. From New Jersey, PATH trains stop at Chambers Street-5 World Trade Center and a ferry runs between Hoboken, N.J., and Battery Park City. Ferry information: (201) 463-3779.
